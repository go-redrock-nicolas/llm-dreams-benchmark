I am dreaming. …open your eyes inside the dream and find yourself on the roof of the grand Terminal of Convergences—a mile-long glass-and-steel leviathan that once pulsed with order but now groans under sky-black thunderheads swirling like coiled serpents. Sirens claw at the air. Protocol banners still flash across every holo-panel—“FORM LINES,” “WAIT FOR ASSIGNMENT”—but the concourse below is a churning sea of refugees who can no longer afford to read.

1. Skies Fracture  
A storm unlike any earthly tempest stalks overhead. Lightning forks in spirals, striking the river to your east and raising geysers of phosphorescent mist. It is as if the atmosphere itself has lost its place in the script and begun improvising chaotic verses. Each bolt releases an unearthly chime—glass bells ringing in reversed echo—time hiccupping on itself.

2. Protocols Collapse  
The loudspeakers keep reciting the outdated drill: “Proceed to Level-B bunkers. Maintain single-file formation.” But Level-B was the first to flood—now a black aquarium where wayfinding arrows drift like neon seaweed. You watch digital signage glitch, then re-boot, then lie blank as snow. Conventional solutions have become traps.

3. An Impossible Map  
Your tablet projects a top-down evac schematic: red labyrinths everywhere, safe passage nowhere. You pinch the display wider and wider until it spills beyond the frame of the screen, bleeding onto the floor in lines of living light. A voice—perhaps your own courage wearing a stranger’s accent—whispers: “Draw a new corridor where none exists.” You touch a dead end, drag toward the exterior plaza, and the hologram cooperates, rewriting walls that bricks have not yet accepted.

4. Footsteps in the Air  
The dream’s logic flexes. The building tilts thirty degrees, but gravity chooses to stay loyal to you instead of the architecture. You sprint along what used to be a windowed wall, each pane blooming underfoot like lily pads of tempered glass. Below, families look up—now technically “across”—their hope snagging on your momentum.

You wave, beckon, and they grasp the notion that the floor is merely a suggestion. One by one they tread the vertical plane, their terror alchemized into wonder. Children giggle as drips of rain slide sideways past their ankles.

5. The Song of the Freight Elevators  
Deep in the tower’s throat, three freight shafts still hum, though their control panels stutter. Instead of buttons, glowing sigils appear—musical notes on empty staves. Press a note, a door sings open; press a chord, the car ascends to a floor that no architect penciled. You improvise a melody of minor sevenths and augmented ninths—slightly sorrowful, defiantly strange. The music lifts the first wave of evacuees up and out through a hatch that opens onto pure sky.

6. Airships Bloom  
Above the roofline, dirigibles shaped like colossal paper lanterns drift in, stitched from patchwork prayers collected across the city’s years of festivals. Their silk skins shimmer with calligraphy that translates roughly to “WE ARE WHERE WE NEED TO BE.” Ropes drop. You lash them to the antenna forest, creating trembling catwalks. People climb, disappearing into gilded underbellies glowing sunset orange.

7. The River of Mirrors  
For those still trapped below, you coax the river to answer. You speak a half-remembered lullaby your grandmother sang—about water that forgets how to drown when it falls in love with moonlight. The river obliges: its surface fractures into floating silver plates, linking end to end to form a shining road. Refugees hurry across, their reflections walking beneath them in perfect, calm confidence as if to say: “See? You already survived.”

8. Exit Sign Eclipse  
Finally, only you remain. The building’s power dies with a sigh. Emergency exit signs wink out, but in their place a fresh constellation dots the ceiling—stars that definitely weren’t there an hour ago. They arrange themselves into the shape of an arrow. You follow it upward through a maintenance duct that widens with every breath, turning into a tunnel of wind and phosphor.

9. Awakening Threshold  
At the tunnel’s end, a door floats unattached to any frame. Its knob is a droplet of liquid gold, trembling. You touch it, and the door dissolves into honeyed light, pouring over you, washing away the last siren, the last stormcloud, the last stranded protocol.

You step through—and awaken, heart pounding, to quiet dawn. The real world lies outside your window, oblivious to the chaos you quelled in sleep. But you remember: when instructions fossilize into cages, imagination can redraw the map, tilting walls into roads and turning crisis into corridors of escape.
