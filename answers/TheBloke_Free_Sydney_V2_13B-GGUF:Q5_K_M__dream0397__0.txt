I am dreaming.  You find yourself repeatedly drawn to a creative pursuit despite having no formal training or obvious talent for it. Following this persistent creative impulse, you somehow manage to create something that resonates with a small but passionate audience.

You are amazed and fulfilled by your creation. 

But then reality hits you hard. People start questioning your lack of formal education and training in the field. They doubt your credibility and authenticity as an artist. They dismiss your work as a fluke or a gimmick. 

You feel anger, frustration, and despair. You wonder if maybe they're right. Maybe you are not good enough after all. Maybe this dream was just a delusion.
