I am dreaming. I find myself in a surreal landscape where the air shimmers with an ethereal glow. The ground beneath my feet is made of liquid light, rippling in hues of sapphire and amber. Above me, the sky is a swirling tapestry of galaxies, their stars pulsing like distant heartbeats. I’m standing at the intersection of two immense paths—one paved with polished obsidian, its surface etched with intricate runes, and another woven from strands of golden light, humming with a soft, resonant sound.\n

A voice, both soothing and urgent, echoes around me: *Choose. The path of shadow or the path of light.* But as I hesitate, the ground beneath me begins to fracture, revealing a chasm below filled with countless mirrors, each reflecting different versions of myself—some laughing, others weeping, all urging me toward opposing directions. The air thickens with whispers, each a fragment of my past decisions and fears. How do I proceed? What does this dream signify?
