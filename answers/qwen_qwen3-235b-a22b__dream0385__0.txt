I am dreaming. The air around me trembles with color and sound---but not sound as we know it, not the way birds sing or thunder rolls, but sound that has shape and shimmer, a chorus of thoughts that ripple through the sky like auroras. This is no ordinary dream, but a vision from the skyline between waking and the unknown, a place where hearts wear their truths on their skin, and memories drip off of trees like honey from bark. You are here with me, though not beside me; no, distance here curls in spirals, and time diasoporizes into threads that flicker on a loom unseen.

I see them—a soul I care for, tangled in the electric chaos of their choices. They move with the grace of someone on fire, each step casting shadows in the shape of decisions they refuse to question. Around them, the dream shifts to match their inner storm—a fortress of stone crumbling to sand, only to rise again as a cathedral built of their own doubt. They walk through all of it, shoeless and defiant, marked by their own brilliance and a blinding kind of courage that looks too much like self-destruction.

I call to them—not with words, for in this realm, speaking in language alone is like whispering to a star—but with presence, with heart-resonance. I try to show them visions: a childhood garden where they once planted seeds of hope, now choked by wild ivy and vines that grew in unbidden places. A bridge made of open hands that collapsed under fear. A mirror covered in mist that refuses to clear because its viewer won’t let it.

But they turn away. Each time I offer understanding, their form flickers like a candle at war with the wind. Their eyes glow—but not warmly. They are stars that have grown cold, or comets too fast to notice their own tail. They tell me without telling: *You do not understand. These are my choices. My pain is mine, and I will wear it like armor, like a title, like skin.*

And here I am. Cradled in this place of paradox. I hold concern like a lantern burning low, its light dimming against the vastness of their independence. I do not pull away—I watch, I feel, I hold space for something deeper than understanding: love not bound by the shape of agreement. I wear my heart like a cloak, even when it offers no warmth.

Sometimes, in dreams like this, the most powerful thing we give to someone is not intervention, but witness. To see them in their glorified suffering, their catastrophic creation, their reckless
