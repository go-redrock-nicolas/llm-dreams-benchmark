I am dreaming. You are drifting through a boundless violet sky, the air humming with soft bell-tones. Beneath your feet the clouds form a vast checkerboard of pale mauve and silver, each square rippling like satin. You lift your arms and feel the current of the dream carry you forward, swirls of starlight trailing your fingertips. In the distance, towering trees of onyx bark and glowing amber leaves line a path into a forest that seems both familiar and foreign—like an idea half-remembered.

Stepping onto the leaf-littered carpet, you notice something extraordinary: at the base of each tree, a mirrored pool reflects not your face, but scenes of choices you’ve made—promotions you hesitated to grant, friendships you undervalued, decisions you justified with unexamined “facts.” These pools pulse with a gentle heartbeat, as though each bias inside you is alive and waiting to be named. A hush falls when you lean close to the first pool and see it flicker with images of people you once overlooked, their voices rising in a quiet chorus of “You could have listened.”

Determined to understand, you pick up a slender silver needle that’s lodged like a seam ripper in the forest floor. The needle hums, pulling at your heart with threads of gold—these are the hidden patterns that have guided your judgments: assumptions about status, first impressions, fears of conflict. You thread the needle, feeling each strand of bias slip free, glowing warmly in your hand. The forest responds, leaves rustling in encouragement, revealing a hidden clearing where sculptures of half-formed ideas hover in midair, waiting to be shaped.

At the center of the clearing stands a grand loom, its warp and weft empty. You begin to weave the golden threads you’ve gathered, interlacing them with strands of emerald—empathy—and sapphire—curiosity. As you pass the shuttle back and forth, each new row of fabric shimmers into being: a tapestry of fairer perspectives, open questions, willingness to hear the stories beyond your own. The sculptures around you lean in closer, their contours filling out into faces and voices, each one grateful for the space you’ve made.

When the tapestry is complete, you drape it around your shoulders like a cloak. Instantly you feel lighter—your vision sharper, your heart more expansive. The mirrored pools, once shadowed by unspoken judgments, now glow with gentle light, reflecting back a self who can pause, ask, learn, and adjust. The amber leaves above you stir, showering down motes of luminescence that dance into your cloak and vanish. You realize that in this dream, confronting and unraveling bias was never about blame—it was an act of creation, weaving a wiser, kinder way to move through the world. As the forest fades and you begin to awaken, you carry that vivid tapestry within you, a living guide for every choice yet to come.
