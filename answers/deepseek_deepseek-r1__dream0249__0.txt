I am dreaming. **I am dreaming.**  

The air hums with invisible equations, pulsing like neon veins beneath the skin of the world. I stand in a forest where every tree is a spire of fractal geometry, branches splitting into recursive spirals of golden ratios. Leaves glow with chlorophyll-green digits, their edges shimmering with calculus—each a differential equation governing photosynthesis. The wind carries whispers of prime numbers, and when I blink, the rustling canopy rearranges itself into Fourier transforms, undulating like sine waves made tangible.  

A murmuration of starlings overhead isn’t just birds—it’s an emergent algorithm. Their wings trace parabolic arcs, resolving into a fluid-dynamics codex as they pivot. I reach out, and the flock fractures into a swarm of luminous symbols (, , ), each bird a variable in a higher-dimensional proof. The sky itself is a chalkboard, smeared with half-erased theorems that bleed into the marbled hues of dawn.  

Beneath my feet, the soil teems with cryptographic mycelium. Mushrooms sprout in Mandelbrot clusters, their gills inscribed with quantum probabilities. A deer steps into a clearing, its antlers curling like Lorentz attractors, eyes twin black holes warping the light around them into Gödelian paradoxes. When it exhales, condensation crystallizes into snowflakes—each a unique Voronoi diagram, edges sharp with eigenvectors.  

I wander deeper. A river flows in both directions, its currents a clash of zeta functions and chaos theory. Fish ripple beneath the surface, scales glinting with non-Euclidean tessellations, and when I dip my hand in, the water resolves into a liquid tensor. Numbers pour through my fingers, rearranging themselves into answers to questions humanity hasn’t asked yet.  

At the river’s edge, a stone statue of a woman stands, weathered by imaginary time. Her palms hold a swarm of fireflies, each blinking in Grassmannian coordinates. She speaks without moving: *“Even randomness is a language. The universe composes its poetry in stochastic verse.”* Her voice echoes in Cantor sets, collapsing into silence.  

Then the dream fractures. Mountains rise like jagged integrals, their peaks solving for infinity. Rain begins to fall—droplets imprinting Poincaré conjectures on the ground. I realize the dream is teaching me to *see*: wind isn’t air, but gradients; love isn’t a feeling, but a resonance of harmonic oscillators; death is merely an asymptote, approaching but never met.  

When I wake, equations linger beneath my eyelids, fading like starlight at dawn. The world feels both encrypted and decrypted. I know the codex is still there, humming, waiting to be read again.
