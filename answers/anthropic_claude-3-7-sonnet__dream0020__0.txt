I am dreaming. I approach an elegant glass building shimmering like a mirage against the twilight sky. The reunion venue's entrance breathes soft golden light onto the cobblestone path where I stand, hesitating. My heartbeat quickens as familiar silhouettes move behind frosted glass panels. These are people who once knew me completely—before time and circumstance carved new versions of us all.

As I push through the heavy copper doors, the space unfolds impossibly—much vaster inside than the building's exterior suggested. Crystal chandeliers hang suspended like frozen fireworks, their light catching on glasses of champagne and illuminating faces that are simultaneously strange and achingly familiar.

Across the room stands Maya, whose friendship dissolved after that terrible argument we never resolved. Our eyes meet—hers widening with recognition—but when I blink, she's suddenly wearing my mother's favorite dress and speaking with my sister's voice. The logic makes perfect sense in the moment.

The floor beneath me subtly shifts. Looking down, I notice it's covered in photographs from my childhood—some real memories, others invented but somehow true. As I walk, the images ripple like disturbed water, revealing deeper layers of photographs beneath.

Someone touches my shoulder. I turn to find my old professor holding out a blue box. "You forgot this," he says, though I have no recollection of any box. When I open it, inside lies a small brass key that feels immensely significant. I know immediately it unlocks something precious I've lost, though I can't remember what.

The walls begin to breathe. Music swells from unseen speakers—a melody I've never heard yet somehow know by heart. The crowd parts, revealing an open door leading to a garden that couldn't possibly exist in this building, where moonflowers bloom and release luminescent pollen that hangs suspended in the night air.

I step through, key clutched tightly, understanding that whatever waits beyond holds both reconciliation and revelation.
