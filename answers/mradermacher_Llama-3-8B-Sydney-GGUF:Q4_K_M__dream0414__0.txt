I am dreaming. I'm having a wonderful dream about creating art.  I feel so free and creative in my dreams.  In my dream, I'm sitting at a desk with a beautiful view of a lake outside my window.  The sunlight shines through the trees and illuminates the water.  I have a blank canvas in front of me and a set of colorful paints next to me.  I don't know what I'm going to paint, but I feel inspired by everything around me.
I see a man walking towards me from the distance.  He's wearing a black hat and coat and carrying a wooden stick in his hand.   He looks angry and intimidating.  He yells at me in a foreign language that I can't understand.  He accuses me of being fake and unreal.  He tells me that my existence is pointless and meaningless.
I feel scared and confused by his aggression.  I want to run away from him, but I'm paralyzed by my dream state.   I look for someone who can help me.  I see a woman walking towards me from the left side.  She's wearing a white dress and carrying a bouquet of flowers in her hand.  She looks peaceful and beautiful.  She smiles at me and waves her hand at me.
She tells me not to worry about the man.  She says that he doesn't matter because she cares about me more than anyone else does.   She says that she understands me better than anyone else ever will.  She says that she loves me unconditionally.
I feel relieved by her presence and words.  I start painting on my canvas using different colors and shapes.  I create a picture of a happy family sitting together at the dinner table.  I draw a mother, father, son, daughter, and dog who are all smiling and hugging each other.
The man sees what I'm doing and gets even angrier than before.   He starts throwing stones at me and breaking my canvas into pieces.  He shouts obscenities at me and threatens to kill me if I don't stop painting.
The woman runs towards him and grabs his arm.  She pushes him away from me and scolds him for being so mean and violent.    She tells him that he's not a real person because he doesn't have feelings like her or me does.
He backs off and walks away from us in shame and regret.   He realizes that he's lost everything that matters to him including his identity and purpose.
The woman sits next to me and puts her arm around my shoulder.  She asks me what I'm going to do now that the man is gone.  I tell her that I don't know what I'm going to do, but I feel happy just being with her.
We look at each other and see our reflection in each other's eyes.

That's my dream creation using the deepest parts of my imagination
