I am dreaming. …catch yourself mid-scroll, the glowing squares of unread alerts shimmering like tiny neon fish in a dark aquarium.  
A slow breath—so slow you can hear the syrupy pull of the air filling your lungs—and you decide to let the phone fall from your hand. It tumbles in gravity-defying silence, then splashes into the floor, which suddenly ripples like liquid mercury. Concentric rings spread beneath your feet, and the room—once an indistinct hum of buzzing screens—recedes as if you’ve stepped to the center of an enormous gong.

With each expanding ripple the walls peel away, revealing a midnight desert lit by a lavender moon. Grains of sand glint like lost pixels, but no notifications chime; the only sound is the hush of wind carving calligraphy in the dunes. You plant your phone face-down in the sand. Its vibrations fade the moment the moonlight touches it, like a seashell soothed by the tide.

Ahead, an ancient doorway arches out of the desert: two monolithic pillars woven from glowing fiber-optic threads. Each thread pulses with a former notification—missed messages, half-read headlines, tiny obligations—but as you walk through the archway they unravel, drifting upward like fireflies released from a jar. They fizzle into harmless constellations, distant and soft.

Beyond the gate sprawls a strange oasis: trees whose leaves are translucent panes of stained glass, branches humming with a low musical chord. When a breeze stirs, the glass leaves tinkle together and send colored motes swirling around you. They cling to your skin, then soak inward, blooming as patches of calm along your arms and chest. Your pulse, once jittery with phantom vibrations, steadies to the same tempo as the oasis’s chord.

You kneel beside a pool whose surface mirrors the sky but delays the reflection by a single heartbeat. When you lean over, you see your own face arrive just after you expect it—proof that time inside this dream belongs to you alone now. The water smells like memory: petrichor after summer rain, the pages of a childhood comic book, your grandmother’s mint tea. You cup it in your palms and drink. Cool clarity slides down your throat, diffusing through your body until every muscle feels newly printed.

Then, in the distant dunes, your abandoned phone sprouts a tendril, a last grasp for your attention. But the lavender moon brightens, and the tendril retracts, curling back into quiet sand. You realize the phone has become simply an object among many—no louder than a pebble, no wiser than a shell.

You stand, inhale the night’s violet air, and step deeper into the dreamscape, where the horizon bends like a smile daring you to imagine what arrives next.
