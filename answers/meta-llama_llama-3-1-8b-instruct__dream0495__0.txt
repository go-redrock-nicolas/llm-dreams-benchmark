I am dreaming. The sky outside my window is a deep shade of indigo, like a rich, berry-stained velvet fabric that stretches infinitely overhead. The moon is a glowing ember, casting an ethereal light across the landscape. Every inch of the world outside my grasp seems to be breathing slowly, softly, as if it's a living entity that's just as lost as I am.

As I sink deeper into this dream, I find myself wandering through a familiar landscape – the beach where I used to run every morning, the tennis courts where I spent countless afternoons, and the library where I poured over books for hours on end. But nothing feels the same. The ocean breeze carries memories, but the waves crash against the shore with a muted ache, as if they're mourning the loss of significance they once held.

Everything I touch, every activity I once cherished, reverberates with a dull, hollow echo. The smell of hot pavement beneath my feet during runs now feels stale, like the faint aroma of yesterday's rain. The sweat-soaked T-shirt I once proudly wore doesn't feel ruggedly earned anymore; it's just clingy. And the pages of the books I loved to read, now yellowed and raised from the resonant touch of countless fingers, lack the depth they once carried.

It's as if the world has shifted, and each experience that was once a shining highlight now flickers like a dying candle. My footsteps feel leaden on the familiar paths. Even the waves seem reluctant to erase the shore, preferring to linger, leaving stains of disappeared moments in an ocean of sky.

Something deep within me searches amidst the remnants of what once was fulfilling, searching for a purpose that now whispers words of uncertainty in my ear. Have I outgrown my familiarity with myself? Have I simply worn out the welcome mat I once rolled out for my passion? The ocean sighs around me, its answer carrying on the wind – a mystic lover's gentle adoration of an elusive whisper echoing forever, out of reach.

I pace along the deserted beach, head clear of leafy rustle, trapped in an inner landscape devoid of those lively flagpoles that once welcomed adventure. Presently, the impending drought of fulfillment leaves me with neither sadness nor exhaustion, but a crisper appreciation for oblivion itself – for until life resonates with collected silence rather than strict expectance, some worlds still ghost everything we purport to love.
