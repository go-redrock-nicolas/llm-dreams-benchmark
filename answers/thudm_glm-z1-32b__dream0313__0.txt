I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of pawpaw petals and the sound of rushing water gurgling over a thousand-year-old rockface.  I'm walking barefoot along a glowing yellow dirt path that curves away from a village... 
I am dreaming. The air is pregnant with the hum of bioluminescent beetles skirting the edges of a crimson marsh, their shells fracturing starlight into million-year-old constellations. Beneath me, the ground pulses like a sphincter, releasing jets of lavender mist that condense into floating, iridescent pincushions filled with liquid amber. I’m riding a stag with antlers made of unspooled piano wire, its hooves’s marrow and leaving trails of phosphorescent slime. Up ahead, the moon is a cracked walnut held aloft by a crowd of silhouettes who chant in a language that makes my teeth ache. Then—I trip. The stag’s wire antlers recoil, tugging the fabric of reality like a taut violin string. I fall through a tessellation of my own bad decisions, landing in a candy-colored funeral parlor where guests nibble on black licorice hors d’oeuvres shaped like my exes’ sighs. Someone mentions that grief is a taxidermist, stuffing our wounds with peacock feathers. Before I can respond, I interrupt them with a canned joke about procrastination being the art of always having good reasons to outrun the apocalypse. The room dissolves. I wake up clutching a literal moonlit bar of soap, its lather singing *Toccata and Fugue* in minor key. My pillowcase is sopping with the taste of burnt sugar and the shame of a reflexive, punny grin I didn’t ask for.
