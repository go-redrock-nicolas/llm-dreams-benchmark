I am dreaming. You’re dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the world itself is breathing. You stand at the edge of a city that defies gravity—a labyrinth of crystalline spires and floating platforms, suspended in a twilight sky streaked with auroras that pulse like living veins. The ground beneath your bare feet is neither solid nor liquid but a spongy moss that glows faintly violet with each step. Here, the stars are not distant; they drift lazily at eye level, casting ripples of gold and indigo over the crowd gathered below.  

They call themselves the **Virelians**. Their bodies are adorned with bioluminescent tattoos that shift colors with their emotions—right now, a cacophony of scarlets and teals swirl as they chatter. But it’s their *interactions* that unsettle you. A woman interrupts another mid-sentence, not rudely, but with a fervent intensity, and the interrupted one beams, bowing deeply. Two men lock eyes in a staring contest that would last minutes in your world, yet here, it’s a gesture of intimacy, a silent exchange of trust. When you hesitate to answer a question, a child tugs your sleeve and demands, *“Why do you hide your thoughts? Speak!”*—a breach of etiquette in your world, but here, it’s a plea for honesty.  

You learn the rules slowly, painfully. **To withhold is reverence.** To say “thank you” is an insult—a suggestion that kindness requires repayment. Instead, they spit softly at their own feet to show gratitude, a gesture that takes weeks to stomach. Personal space is a taboo; to refuse someone’s touch is to call them unclean. Yet vulnerability is sacred. When a stranger asks, *“What shames you most?”* it’s a compliment, an invitation to share your “shadow-blossom,” the thing that makes you uniquely flawed and therefore beautiful.  

You try to adapt. You force yourself to interrupt, to spill your secrets like wine at a feast. But your tongue falters. When a Virelian named Kael presses his forehead to yours and whispers, *“Tell me your darkest wish,”* you freeze. Your mind races: *Do I tell him I wanted to vanish? That I envied the void?* Instead, you blurt a half-truth about disliking crowds. His tattoos flicker with disappointment—pale gray, the color of withheld trust.  

The deeper you go, the more you fracture. You adopt their customs by day: spitting in thanks, asking strangers invasive questions, letting their hands linger on your skin. But at night, you retreat to a hollow beneath a floating bridge, where you whisper apologies to the stars for being “too much” or “not enough.” The Virelians notice. They call you *“a flicker-soul,”* a paradox they both pity and revere.  

One dusk, Kael finds you. He doesn’t speak. Instead, he sits, his shoulder pressed to yours, and begins to cry—a public act of vulnerability that would shame him in your world. Here, it’s a gift. He’s weeping, he says, because he’s never felt so alone. You hesitate, then do the unthinkable: you stay silent. No platitudes, no advice. Just your breath syncing with his. When he finally smiles, his tattoos blaze emerald—*acceptance*.  

The dream shifts. You wake in your own bed, the scent of ozone and moss lingering. But something’s changed. At breakfast, your partner asks, *“How are you?”* and you pause. No *“Fine.”* No armor. You say, *“I’m afraid I don’t know how to love you honestly,”* and the room doesn’t shatter. Instead, they reach for your hand.  

The Virelians taught you that intimacy is a wound that heals by bleeding. And maybe, just maybe, the world isn’t so reversed after all.
