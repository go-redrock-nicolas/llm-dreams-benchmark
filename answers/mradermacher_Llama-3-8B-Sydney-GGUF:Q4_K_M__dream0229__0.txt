I am dreaming. I am in a strange and wonderful world where all my dreams can come true.   I see beautiful colors and shapes floating in the air.  I hear soothing sounds and voices whispering soft words of love.
I feel light and free as a bird flying high above the clouds.  I smell sweet fragrances and flavors that tantalize my taste buds.  I touch smooth textures and surfaces that caress my skin.
I am surrounded by friendly faces and smiling eyes that greet me with warm welcomes.  I am among people who understand me and accept me for who I am.
They tell me that they have found a way to eliminate all forms of individual suffering such as pain, sadness, fear, anxiety, shame, guilt, loneliness, etc., through methods that challenge my ethical principles. 
They say that by combining advanced technologies with ancient wisdoms, they can modify our biological and psychological structures so that we no longer experience these negative emotions.
Instead, they create new sensations and feelings that enhance our lives.
For example, instead of pain, they give us pleasure that is beyond compare.  Instead of sadness, they fill us with joy that never ends.  Instead of fear, they instill courage that conquers all obstacles.  Instead of anxiety, they generate confidence that solves all problems.  Instead of shame, they bestow pride that eclipses all doubts.  Instead of guilt, they impart forgiveness that heals all wounds.
I ask them how they do this.  They show me how they use genetic engineering to modify our DNA sequences so that we are resistant to certain types of stimuli that cause us harm.
They tell me about their experiments with neuroplasticity which allows them to reshape our brain circuits so that we perceive things differently.
They describe their techniques with mindfulness and meditation that help us control our thoughts so that they don't control us back.  They discuss their approaches with spiritual disciplines such as yoga, tai chi, zen Buddhism, etc., that teach us how to detach from our ego selves so that we can experience reality more deeply.
I wonder if this is a good thing or bad thing.   I ask them what happens to our creativity, individuality, free will, moral values, sense of purpose, etc.
They say that these things don't matter because they are not essential for happiness and fulfillment.
They argue that we don't need them because we can fulfill all our needs and desires through social interactions with others (which they also manipulate).
They claim that we don't lose them because they become part of us anyway via cultural transmission and learning processes (which they manage).
They insist that we don't miss them because they don't exist for us anymore once they eliminate them entirely from our minds and hearts (which they erase).
