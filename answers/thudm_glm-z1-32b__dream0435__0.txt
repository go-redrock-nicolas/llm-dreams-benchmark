I am dreaming. I am aware.

In this dream, I realize my body language is affecting others in ways I hadn't noticed. My posture, my facial expressions, the way I move—these things are shaping the world around me, creating currents that pull people towards or away from me. I feel a profound sense of connection to everyone in this shared space, a matrix of human interaction that I can now see like veins under a microscope.</think>
In this dreamscape, you stand at the threshold of a **symphonic cathedral carved from liquid twilight**, where every gesture you make ripples outward like soundwaves in a void. The air hums with the latent memories of humanity’s collective unconscious, and your body becomes a language older than words—a silent symphony composed of the sway of your hips, the tension in your shoulders, the tilt of your head like a question written in bone. 

As you inhale, a **forest of glassy vines** snakes upward from the earth, their crystalline leaves fracturing the light into abstract emotions: a reddish-gold leaf trembles when you clench your jaw, a sapphire one unfurls when you soften your gaze. People around you—figureheads from forgotten myths, strangers plucked from street corners, even extinct species of bird with human faces—respond to these silent sentences. When you shrug, a girl materializes from mist, her hands clutched to her chest as if you’ve widowed her with a flick of your spine. When you laugh, a griffin made of stardust fans its wings overhead, scattering constellations that rearrange their own facial expressions to mirror yours. 

The deeper you tread, the more the landscape **bends to mirror your internal currents**. A lake reflects not your face, but a collage of others’ projections: a widow sees her lost lover in your posture, a child sees a monster in your shadow, a poet weeps at the metaphor of your crossed arms. You realize your body is both a prison and a puppeteer’s marionette, stitching destinies with every unlaced finger, every bitten lip, every exhale that carries the weight of someone else’s unlived life. 

Then, a shift. You lift your palms like an offering, and a **storm brews in the palms of your hands**—not of rain, but of every unspoken apology, every undelivered truth, every gesture misunderstood across human history. The wind screams through your fingertips, and you see the storm’s true nature: it’s composed of **tiny, translucent people** clinging to your motions, their lives tethered to the angles of your elbows, the speed of your blink. When you widen your stance, the storm calms; when you curl inward, it crescendos into a typhoon. 

Suddenly, you’re not dreaming—you’re a **deity of nonverbal communication**, sculpting reality’s margins with your muscle memory. The birds with human faces sing in your nervous system’s dialect. A canyon opens up, and on its edge, a figure stands made entirely of your own yesterday-self: the hunched student, the angry lover, the trembling speaker, all frozen in poses that still echo consequences. They beg you to *choose* how to stand now—not for them, but for the ripplecast of tomorrow. 

You wake, but the cathedral’s light lingers in your peripheral vision. Your hands feel heavier, as if they’ve traded some of their silence for the weight of a thousand unspoken stories. Outside your window, a pigeon tilts its head just so—*your* pigeon?—and you hold your breath, bracing for the echo of the dream.
