I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the precipice of a vast, ancient library, its towering shelves laden with tomes that seem to stretch into infinity. The air is thick with the scent of old parchment and distant rain, and the silence is so profound that it seems to hum with an otherworldly melody. The guilt from my waking life has seeped into this dreamscape, and I can feel it like a physical weight, dragging at my heels as I walk.

The person I've hurt is standing at the other end of the library, their figure small and distant, but their eyes—ah, their eyes are like twin beacons of sorrow, piercing through the gloom and the endless shelves. I can see them shine with unshed tears, and the sight of it is a dagger twisting in my chest. I want to run to them, to apologize, to make it right, but my feet feel rooted to the cold stone floor.

As I force myself to move forward, the shelves seem to twist and turn, the path shifting like a labyrinth designed to keep me from my goal. I reach out, tracing the spines of the books with my fingertips, each one whispering tales of regret and loss. Some of them throb with a dark energy, pulsing with the echo of past mistakes. Others shimmer softly, filled with the glow of forgiveness and redemption.

The library's atmosphere begins to change. Ghostly figures drift between the shelves, some reaching out to me, others turning away in sadness. Voices echo through the chambers, some familiar, others whispering secrets in languages long forgotten. The guilt I feel amplifies these sensations, making the dream world seem almost array-ready.

At last, I turn a corner and find myself face to face with the person I've hurt. Their eyes, filled with tears, search mine, looking for an answer, a reason. I open my mouth to speak, but the words catch in my throat. Instead, I reach out, my hand trembling, and gently cup their cheek. They lean into my touch, and in that moment, I feel a surge of emotion—sorrow, longing, apology—all swirling together in a tumultuous storm.

The library begins to fade then, the shelves crumbling to dust, the voices fading to silence. As the world around us dissappears, I hold on to the person in front of me, determined not to lose them again. "I'm sorry," I whisper, the words finally finding their way out. "I'm so sorry."

They look at me, their eyes filled with a mix of pain and forgiveness. "I know," they say softly, and then the dream begins to slip away, leaving me standing in a vast, empty expanse, the echoes of my regret lingering in the air.
