I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the crossroads of a strange city where the buildings breathe gently, their facades rippling like pond water touched by a gentle breeze. The sky above transitions through impossible colors—deep indigo bleeding into burnt amber and shades that have no names in waking life.

As I walk the cobblestone streets that seem to rearrange themselves behind me, I notice photographs hanging in mid-air along my path. Each one captures moments with friends from different chapters of my life—college laughter in dim dormitories, workplace celebrations, weekend adventures in forests and cities alike.

When I reach to touch these memories, my fingers pass through them, leaving ripples like disturbed water. The faces in the photos are turning away, one by one, their features becoming indistinct as they focus on horizons I cannot see.

I feel a peculiar gravity pulling at my chest—not painful, but significant, like the weight of accumulated distance. Time itself seems to materialize as a silver thread connecting me to each person, stretching thinner with each step I take.

The city transforms around me into a vast library where bookshelves tower endlessly upward. Each book contains a friendship's complete story, and I realize with dream-logic clarity that some volumes are closing, their final chapters written without dramatic conclusions—just the gentle fade of parallel lives continuing on their separate trajectories.

Rain begins falling indoors, each drop containing miniature scenes of futures unfolding—my old friends at weddings I'll never attend, celebrating achievements I'll hear about through digital echoes, living in homes I'll never visit.

Yet strangely, the melancholy is balanced by a warm light emanating from paths ahead that I cannot yet see clearly. New books with blank pages float nearby, waiting. The dream-city shifts again, revealing constellations of unmet connections, glowing with possibility.

I wake with tears and a smile, understanding that impermanence and potential exist in the same breath.
