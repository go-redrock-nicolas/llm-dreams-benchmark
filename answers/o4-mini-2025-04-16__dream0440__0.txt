I am dreaming. I drift weightless through a cathedral of shifting light, its walls shimmering like liquid moonlight. Beneath my feet, cobblestones pulse with memories—each stone a fragment of a childhood belief that once felt unassailable. One stone glows molten-orange, whispering, “You must stay small to be safe.” Another crackles electric blue: “Asking for help is weakness.”  

Drawn forward by a soft humming, I step into a vast hall hung with countless mirrors. Each mirror reflects a scene from my past—a classroom where I froze under a teacher’s sharp gaze, a birthday party where I hid behind balloons, convinced I didn’t deserve the applause. My heart tightens as I recognize the rules I absorbed so long ago.  

But here, in this dream, I am both observer and architect. I reach out and touch a mirror’s surface. It ripples under my fingers, and the image softens. With a breath that feels like starlight, I press my palm into the glass—shattering it into glittering shards. Where fear once lived, a faint glow appears.  

Beyond the broken glass lies a new corridor of rose-gold light. Along its walls, ancient runes hover, spelling out the unconscious rules that held me captive. I place my hand on the first rune—“You are too much”—and see it dissolve into petals of fire, drifting away. The second rune—“Your worth depends on performance”—melts into a gentle rain of pearls.  

With each rule I rewrite, I feel my chest expand. I gather a quill fashioned from moonbeams and dip it into a pool of liquid silver. On the wall I write new decrees: “I am enough in every moment.” “I am allowed to reach for what I desire.” “Asking for help is an act of courage.”  

As the final words glow bright against the rose-gold expanse, the corridor unfolds into a vast open sky of dawn-blue. I step forward and feel my wings unfurl—soft, iridescent, built from every piece of reclaimed self-worth. The wind carries me upward. Below, the cathedral of light shrinks, now a gentle echo of who I once was.  

And in this dream, free from old chains, I realize I deserve not only the life I once feared to claim, but far more than I ever imagined.
