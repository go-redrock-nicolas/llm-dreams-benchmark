I am dreaming. You’re standing in a control room carved from obsidian and starlight, its walls pulsing with holographic maps of a fractured world. Rivers bleed crimson, cities drown in inverted rainstorms, and deserts bloom with skeletal flowers that scream when the wind touches them. Your hands hover over a console made of bone and circuitry, each button labeled with a language you’ve never learned but somehow understand: *triage*, *rubble*, *ghosts*. The air smells of ozone and burnt saffron, and every breath feels heavier than the last, as though the atmosphere itself is rationing oxygen.  

A child materializes beside you, her skin translucent, veins glowing like bioluminescent rivers. She holds a cracked tablet displaying real-time feeds: a hospital without power, a dam on the verge of collapse, a refugee caravan swallowed by sand. “Choose,” she whispers, her voice echoing from the depths of a thousand wells. You realize she’s not a child at all—she’s the *crisis*, its physical manifestation, a being forged from the collective weight of impossible decisions.  

You press a button. A drone swarm erupts from the ceiling, morphing into wings, then into nets, then into ladders that stretch into the void. Below, a city clings to the edge of a cliff, its buildings melting like wax. People cling to windowsills, shouting in languages that twist into static. You calculate trajectories, survival rates, the half-life of hope. A woman in a tattered white coat grabs your arm—Dr. Liora, your counterpart from a parallel life, her eyes hollowed by sleepless years. “You can’t save them all,” she says, but her lips don’t move. The words vibrate in your molars.  

A siren wails, and the floor dissolves. You’re falling through a kaleidoscope of need: a mother clutching a feverish infant, a farmer burying his crops in ash, a soldier lowering his rifle to cradle a wounded sparrow. You try to catch them, but your hands pass through like mist. The child-representative of the crisis giggles, now riding a carousel of rusted gears. “Prioritize,” she sings. “Prioritize.”  

You land in a library where books scream when opened, their pages fluttering like trapped birds. A council of ancestors floats above you, their faces blurred by time. They demand a sacrifice: a memory, a limb, a future. You offer your left hand, and it crumbles to ash, but the pain is replaced by a surge of clarity—a map of underground water sources, the coordinates of a hidden clinic. The child applauds; the city on the cliff begins to rise, levitating on roots that drill into the earth’s core.  

But then the sky splits open. A second crisis descends—a black sun, a swarm of locusts with human teeth, a silence so dense it crushes eardrums. The holograms flicker. Dr. Liora is gone. The carousel spins wildly, and the child’s laughter curdles into a wail. You realize this is the true test: not choosing who lives or dies, but confronting the fact that the game never ends. The console begins to dissolve, and you grab a shard of obsidian, slashing your palm. Your blood becomes a bridge—a temporary fix, a tourniquet for the world.  

You wake up gasping, the taste of saffron and ash on your tongue, your hands still trembling with the phantom weight of the impossible.
