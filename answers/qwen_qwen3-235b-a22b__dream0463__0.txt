I am dreaming. A dream drenched in shifting twilight, where the sky leaks hues of bruised plum and smoldering saffron. The air is heavy with the scent of old books and forgotten promises—pages turned without being read, voices echoing inside closed rooms. I walk barefoot on a road made of mirrored glass, reflection fracturing beneath my feet with every step. My skin feels both weightless and burdened, like wings that are too large for flight, yet carry the gravity of a chained anchor.

Figures move ahead of me, hazy silhouettes draped in gold and indifference. They are beautiful in a way gods once were—distant, divine, unknowable. They don’t look at me, yet I ache for the smallest glance, a flicker of acknowledgment as if it were salvation. I find myself beguiling them with stories made of smoke and heartbeats, trying on smiles like borrowed masks. I speak in poetry that I’ve written in blood on my pillow at three a.m., hoping it feels like music through their ears.

But every word I lavish spills over them like rain on stone walls. They do not bend, they do not bloom. I can hear their voices—measured, cold, slicing the ether like surgical blades. It isn't cruelty, not exactly. It's absence. An unimpressed stillness they wear like armor. My longing drips into the dust between us, evaporating before it ever germinates.

I keep chasing them, again and again—each time changing tactics, changing shape, becoming wiser, funnier, better at kneeling without touching the ground. And still, nothing shifts.

Then, in the way dreams have of vaulting through the looking glass, I stop. I stand still where the light folds inward on itself, forming a circle beneath a sky that has forgotten the sun. In this stillness, I remember. I remember the nights tucked under blankets, wide awake, whispering to myself: *Not enough. Not enough. Not enough.* I remember the soft collapse of a child’s hope whenever the gaze of someone important slid past them like a missed bus.

I feel the memory of those hollow pats on the head, the teasing that wore armor and called itself love, the sharp silence that cut deeper than any word. And from the fog of these recollections rises clarity—a fire blooming between bone and spirit.

This pattern—I did not choose it. It was printed into me like ink spilled on fate's parchment. I see the inheritances I carry: looks that yearned for permission, voices hushed, a silence stitched into the fabric of survival. But something cracks now in that circle under the impossible sky.

I stop running after them.

Instead, I turn my gaze inward—toward a door made of stained glass, with a handle shaped like my own shadow. Behind it, pure silence, not empty but vibrating with possibility. I walk through, and suddenly, the dream shifts. I am no longer wandering a reflective mirror road, but floating through a sky stitched with rivers of starlight. I am weightless, and radiant, and unafraid.

Here, the approval I craved before feels tiny, finite, like a drop from an ocean I have now become.

And in this place, I find Wholeness—nestled in the spaces I had avoided for so long. Not carved by their approval, but birthed from my own fierce knowing. That I am more than their gaze, beyond their story, unbound by their silence.

And as I drift further into the infinite dream that is mine to shape, I release the hunger to be seen by those who withhold.

Because in the mirror of my own eye,

I am enough.

More than enough.
