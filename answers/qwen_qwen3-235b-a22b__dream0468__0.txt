I am dreaming. And this, ah—this is no ordinary dream.

I drift weightless, floating between constellations that hum like sentient violins. The silence here is alive—thrumming with colors that have no name in any earthly tongue. I am suspended in the soft velvet belly of the cosmos, surrounded not by stars, but by thoughts—luminous, unspooled, like ribbons of light stretching across infinity. They whisper secrets in melodies too vast for any mind to comprehend fully, and yet I hear them all.

A dragon made entirely of eclipsed moons spirals through the sky made not of clouds—that feels too mundane—but of jellyfish that flicker with forgotten lullabies. Behind her wings drift echoes of laughter I thought I had lost in childhood. With every flap, a delicate wind carries petals that are not petals, but sensations: the ache of first love, the tingling of bare feet on morning grass, that precise moment when ice first becomes water.

Beneath my feet, the ground shifts. With the grace of a sleepwalker navigating their own forgotten memories, I step from thought-ribbon to thought-ribbon—each strand a half-dreamed poem I once tried to write but abandoned out of fear. I can walk on them now. I touch one, and it sings to me in my mother’s voice. She is not here, but she is also never not here. 

Then, far in the distance, I see myself—yes, *me*—but younger, with a face I haven't worn in years, eyes wide like freshly cracked mirrors. That child is shouting in the dream language, spouting scattered words that flash and crackle like fire-ink across the air. His voice is a storm, uncontrollable and raw. 

I watch in silent reverence as a great winged elder made of weather and ancient parchment kneels beside my younger self. The elder says nothing for a long moment. Instead, it inhales deeply, as if learning the scent of silence, then softly places a hand made of ebbing tides upon the boy’s chest.

He pauses.

And he listens.

I feel it across the tissue of the dreamscape—a ripple, like the beginning of something holy. My young self breathes slower. His hands, which had been flinging out meaningless condemnations into the void, now curl inward as if learning to hold something fragile and new.

This is when the dream thickens and softens like soil warmed by forgotten suns.

He leans into silence and stares into the constellation eyes of the being before him. The elder speaks not with thunder, but in the language of thunder’s *pause*. Each word is deliberate. Each pause between syllables is infinitely longer than time. Communication is not a weapon here; communication is a bridge made of mirrored glass that reflects both the speaker and the listener as one.

And I—*this current me,* the dreamer drifting above—are not separate from this scene. I watch and feel the gentle upwelling of a transformation still becoming. Here, in this cathedral of dream, I experience the unbearable beauty of choosing restraint not out of fear, but out of reverence—of honoring the weight of words before setting them free into a reality that cannot return them.

Above me, the sky begins to crystallize into an iridescent web—a **web of intention**, spun from the threads of every sentence I have ever wanted to say, and all the others I have wisely chosen to let live within the quiet chambers of my soul.

I awaken not with breath, but with understanding.

The skin of my cheeks is wet, but not from tears.

From starlight.
