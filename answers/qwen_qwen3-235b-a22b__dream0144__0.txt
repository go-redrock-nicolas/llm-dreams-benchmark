I am dreaming. The world around me is strange and luminous, stitched together from stardust and shadow. I stand in a vast expanse where the sky weeps silver rain that never touches the ground—it hovers and dances like suspended fireflies. Beneath my bare feet lies a grassless earth, soft and pulsing like the skin of something ancient and alive. In the distance, mountains stretch into spirals, and rivers echo with song, flowing backwards toward forgotten memories.

I feel a warmth behind me, a gentle pull. When I turn, I see them—eight figures cloaked in light so soft it's like watching the sun through morning fog. I don’t know them, but I recognize something in their eyes. A shared wound. A healed fracture.

They form a circle around me.

One by one, they speak. But not with mouths. Their voices come as feelings, memories woven into sensations—the sharp pang of betrayal, the aching grip of doubt long carried, the stunned silence of failure that cracked open the world. Somehow, I know—we all carry the same burdens, though disguised in different storms.

A woman clad in robes woven from twilight steps forward. Her voice, rich as thunder in the bones, says:  
*“You are not the first to feel lost in the dark. But in the quiet soil of surrender, roots grow stronger. When the world stripped me bare, I thought I was broken. But the falling apart was where life began again.”*

Another—a man with laughter etched into every scar—says,  *“You’re searching for escape, but what you want is release. Not running from the pain, but transforming it. I once wore shame like armor. Only when I laid it down did I walk tall.”*

I feel their words in my bones, like balm poured into cracks. My heart begins to soften. The weight I carry in waking pulses now in rhythm with theirs.

An elderly figure offers me a stone that flickers with flame and frost—two truths in one shape. *“You carry what feels unbearable,”* they murmur without words. *“But it is not yours to carry forever. The struggle is not a failure—it is the forge. One day you will look back and see how this sorrow carved you into a lantern for others.”*

Tears that taste like forgotten joy stream down my face.

There is no judgment here, no hurry—only the soft passive understanding of souls who have been scorched and risen anew. They pass me a mirror made of starlight and nightfall. When I look into it, I see me—but not as I am. As I’m becoming. Wiser. Tenderer. Resilient not because I was born that way, but because I survived what I once thought would finish me.

And then they vanish.

Not cruelly, but gently—as twilight fades into dawn.

I wake, still cradling the echoes of their truth. A gentle flame has been lit—not at my core, but in the hollows. A knowing: This, too, will shape me into something beautiful.

This, too, will be part of my story.

Not the end. But a turning.
