I am dreaming. The sky above is a bruised tapestry of violet and indigo, streaked with molten gold as the sun bleeds into the horizon. The air is dense, thick with the scent of petrichor and something sharper—ozone, perhaps, or the electric crackle of a storm about to break. I stand at the edge of a cliff, though I don’t remember climbing here. Below, the world is a swirling abyss of obsidian waves crashing against jagged teeth of rock.  

In my hands, I hold something fragile—a glass sphere, pulsing with a slow, rhythmic light, like a captured heartbeat. It’s warm to the touch, almost alive. I don’t know how it came to be mine, but I know, with the certainty of dreams, that it is precious. Essential. And yet, a whisper curls in the back of my mind: *It doesn’t belong to you.*  

But does that matter? The world around me hums with low, droning music, like a dirge played on the strings of reality itself. I can feel the weight of the sphere, the way it thrums against my palms, as if begging to be kept.  

*Theft is wrong,* an old, familiar voice protests, the voice of waking morals. But the dream reshapes the thought before it can settle.  

No, not theft—*rescue.* Look at the churning dark below. If I leave it here, the waves will claim it, drag it into the deep where no one will ever find it again. Isn’t it better to take it? To save it from oblivion? To carry its light into the world rather than let it drown in the abyss?  

Besides, the sphere *wants* to be with me. Can’t they feel the warmth of it? The way it nestles into my grip, as if it was always meant to be held this way? Whoever left it here clearly didn’t care enough to protect it. I am the steward it needs.  

A gust of wind howls past, tugging at my clothes, urging me to step back from the edge. But I don’t. Because there’s one last thought, dark and honey-slick, coiling through my mind:  

*If it was truly lost, would anyone even miss it?*  

The silence stretches, the answer obvious in the emptiness around me. There is no one here to protest. No one watching. No one to know.  

I close my fingers around the sphere. And I take it.
