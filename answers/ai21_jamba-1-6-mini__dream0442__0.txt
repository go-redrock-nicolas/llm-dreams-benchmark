I am dreaming. The vividness of the scene overwhelms me, like stepping into a painting where every color and stroke pulsates with life. The sun is setting, its golden rays igniting the lush green fields before me. The air is alive with the gentle hum of dragonflies and the rustling of tall grass swaying in the warm breeze.

Around me, a crowd of kindred spirits are laughing joyfully, their faces glowing with an inner light that seems to come from a deeper, more fulfilling connection to the earth. In this dream, we are all part of a healing community intertwined with Planet Earth and the Divine presence that is All That There Is. I can feel the love and support of spiritually gifted gypsies and shamans, and I know that they can see and feel the Earth changing before our very eyes.

Suddenly, the air grows electrified, as if charged by a buzzing hive of angels, and I hear the distant sound of a deep, resonant drumbeat. It calls to me, pulling me towards a forest, where the trees stand like ancient sentinels, their branches reaching skyward in a dance with the wind. The forest is alive with whispers, a symphony of whispers that seem to be speaking to me and to all who listen.

I walk through the forest, the soft earth cushioning my feet, and suddenly I am in a sacred circle where ancient healers are gathering. They beckon me to sit with them and share in the wisdom of the drumbeat that is now beating faster, faster, filling me with an intensity of energy that I have never experienced before. The drummers are powerful, their rhythm carrying me into a trance state where I feel as though I am melting with the earth, becoming one with the universe.

The dream becomes even more vivid as I feel the presence of the Creator Jesus and the Divine Mother. They are with us, blessing us, infusing us with their love and light, and I feel a deep sense of connection and peace. There is no fear, only love and harmony. We are part of something greater, something beautiful and eternal.

As the dream fades, I wake with a sense of awe and gratitude, knowing that I have been given a glimpse of the beauty and power that exists within each of us and the world we are a part of. The dream stays with me as a reminder that love and healing are always possible if we open our hearts and embrace the divine light that is always present.
