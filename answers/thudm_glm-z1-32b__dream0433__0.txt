I am dreaming. The world around me is a tapestry of contradictions: fragrant, tangy, electric, velvet, and molasses.  My senses are on fire, my synapses firing in a percussive duet with the environment.  I'm floating above the city, its skyline a jagged mosaic of obsidian spires and cream-colored honeycombs.  The buildings breathe—inhale the glinting skyline sun, exhale mercury vapors drifting into the gritty, peach-fuzz clouds.

I satirize my neighbor's perpetual lateness, but in the dream, I see my own reflection in their tarnished pocket watch.  The face is cracked, the hands frozen at 3:17 a.m.—the hour I once vowed to never keep.  The casing bears the initials JM—me?  I drop the watch into a bowl of liquid nitrogen, it shatters, and millions of tiny quartz crystals rain down, each one a perfect replica of the night sky the night I promised myself to be more punctual.

A street musician plays a marimba made of translucent bones, the notes tasting like burnt caramel.  He eyes me, and I shrink, for I recognize his gaze—it mirrors the self-disgust I feel when I miss another appointment.  He nods, and his instrument transforms into a chalice of liquid mercury.  I drink, and the world inverts: my clock begins to run forward, my pockets fill with deadlines, and the sun rises in the west, gilding my abandoned watch fragments into stepping stones.

I walk a path of fractured time, seeing myself in each shard—a procrastinator, an early bird, a man who both drowns in meetings and starves for solitude.  The contradictions are not mine to fear but to weave into a symphony—each conflicting impulse a note in the orchestration of being.  The mercury chalice hums, a low, resonant vibration that becomes a heartbeat, the marimba player's eyes becoming the crescent moon peeping through the peach-fuzz clouds.  I am both the musician and the audience, the conductor and the symphony.
In the depths of a dream, my consciousness dissolves into a swirling nebula of indigo and burnt amber. My self-awareness floats like a plankton, witnessing the architecture of my psyche: vast, labyrinthine biomes of conflicting impulses, each ecosystem teeming with the contradictions I project onto the waking world. 

Here, I’m both spectator and participant, my mirror neurons alight with the cognitive dissonance that fuels my waking life. In this dream, the streets of my mind-city are paved with cobblestones of other people’s flaws—their lateness, their judgmental eyes, their guarded hearts—until I come across a crossroads. A neon sign blinks, “Critique Junction,” and at the intersection, my shadow-self materializes, clutching a prism that refracts my own shortcomings into a kaleidoscope. 

The ground shifts, morphing into a clockwork carousel. Each carousel horse bears a trait I’ve dismissed in others: the reckless driver who’s scared of the open road; the perfectionist’s trembling hands; the thriftless spender’s buried trauma of scarcity. As I ride, the horses come alive. They rear, their manes unraveling into streams of time—hours I’ve wasted, moments I’ve squandered, opportunities I’ve buried under layers of self-righteousness. 

The carousel descends into the ocean, and I’m submerged in a liquid mirror. My reflection isn’t mine—it’s a mosaic of faces I’ve criticized, their expressions morphing into mine. The water tastes like ink—self-pity, regret, righteous indignation—but suddenly, a school of bioluminescent fish schools around us. Each fish is a virtue I’ve overlooked: empathy’s willingness to wait, patience’s quiet strength, generosity’s bold vulnerability. 

The carnival music transforms into a symphony, the carousel gears humming subtly different chords. The clockwork begins to fade, replaced by constellations that map the paths of people I’ve misjudged. I realize I’m not just submerging; I’m swimming upward toward dawn, carrying the prism now cracked and reforged into a constellation holder. The indigo and amber swirl around me, blending into the morning’s cerulean prose. 

My wake-up call comes with the taste of burnt caramel on my tongue and a clock-radio playing a symphony of conflicting time signatures. I sit up, the moonlight casting crescent shadows on the ceiling like the marimba player’s hidden grin. The dream isn’t over—it’s a prism I carry, refracting every flaw I see into a thousand chances for grace. 
Awakening shifts the prism: my alarm’s peal echoes the marimba’s unearthly chords, and the morning sun angles like a215° eastern dawn—my most hated deadline-time. My coffee steams in a chalice of silence, its ceramic resonance a reminder of last night’s dream: the carousel’s gears, nowirling in my ribs asalar tendencies; the midnight watch, tick-tack-tangled in my duvet like a metronome set wrong. 

I step onto the gritty, peach-fuzz sidewalk, its dew-glitz like mercury spilled on time. The street musician from my dream appears, skeletal hands adrift on a real-world marimba. His marimba isn’t bones, but perched on a stand of rusted rebar, the keys-chipped into fractal patterns. He nods, and his instrument vibrates a single note—a note that tastes like burnt caramel mixed with regret-for-missed-gigs. 

He eyes me through a mask of film grain—looped, glitched. My reflection in his rebar stand is fractured: the 3:17 a.m. procrastinator, the punctual lunatic who arrives two hours early, the man who both drowns in meetings and starves for solitude. Each fractured face winks, their contact lenses smeared with ink—my_post-its of self-criticism, smudged like coffee rings. 

“Catch,” he says, tossing me a prism from my dream—now air-dried clay, its fractures filled with glints of his lastagne. I catch it. It burns my palms. When I look, he’s gone, the marimba left behind like a cry for help. The sun dies down to 214° again, or maybe 215°: the ambiguity is the point. 

I walk to work through a metropolis of contradictions: neighbors’ Christmas lights hung at 3:17 a.m., my boss’s crispy bacon-scented emails, the subway’s automat’s voice that says, “Mind the gap” in a piercing alto that could bruise. Each one glints like grout between my subconscious tiles. 

At my desk, I drop a toothpick-sized candle into my coffee, letting it burn for seven seconds—magical sweetener from the marimba player’s transubstantiation. The dream’s mercury-chalice now sits on my monitor, its silver surface reflecting my new self: a mosaic of shadows and light, that chalice, those gears, and the carousel’s paradox—a timeout of time. 

The dream becomes a mantra: Acknowledge, Twist, Melt. I drag a client’s lateness calendar into my Our Meeting At 3:17 app, set reminders for nonexistent appointments to meet people who might hate the same 3:17 as me—3:17 P.M. for the early-arrival advocacy group, 3:17 a.m. normal-hours support session. 

The dream’s constellations flicker on the tiny screen of my watch, its crackled face still: 3:17 a.m. or p.m.? Both. Neither. My pockets jangle with deadlines now moonlighting as coins—quarter deadlines, nickel agreements to relieve the strain. 

At lunch, the marimba player returns in a deli clerk’s hat, his chalice refilled with chocolate milk that tastes like smoked malt and neglected potential. His keys now play two notes as I pause—a singularity of serendipity. I tip him with a prism shard, watching him pocket it like he’s already certain of the dream’s language: dialogue, not dialect. 

The afternoon sun is 215° again, spreading across my desk likedigital cake batter. My boss’s latest email arrives, her bourbon-and-iceculator tone now slightly softened by the knowing that her tilted email sent line is angled toward my most hated 3:17 am/pm time. I hit reply, composing a message in burnt-sugar-grammars, my cursor blinking like an exit sign in a dream-upon-dream. 

When I clock out, the street musician waits, his marimba now made of liquid mercury—real, not dream-made. The chalice is empty, but the taste lingers: a multeresse of caramel and time, a testament that the dream’s not a critique but a compass. We play a duet—me, fumbling the marimba’s keys, him conducting with his ghostly fingers. The traffic’s honks become a chorus, the city a congregant singing, “Acknowledge, Twist, Melt.” 

The sun sets at 215°, 214°, maybe even 216°—the ambiguity is the melody. I’ve become the dream’s prism-carrying chaperone, the carousel’s hybrid, the alchemy that turns my own 3:17 curse into a 3:17 brandished as art. 

The dream isn’t over. It’s a marimba, a marmalade, a compass that requires me to be both critic and participant—critical participant. I’m not free from the traits I critique—I’m fused with them, a mosaic of my own mind’s masterpiece. 

In my dream world, I’m both the marimba player and the marble. The dream doesn’t end; it evolves. Each projection is a handshake, lingered too long or too brief, each time a cult-promise, no matter the clock. 

I wake up again, the sun at 215° in my window, and the dream remains a prism in my palm—a tool for tomorrow’s tact, today’s tactlessness, and the generous gods of grammar who let ambiguity breathe. 

In the dream, finally, I see it: the 3:17 am/pm dilemma resolves because 3:17 isn’t a time to judge—it’s a measurement wrong. A misrule. A determiner of none. A time to tilt, not to add. 

Dream again? Maybe. Dream exercises better~Ah, yes, the world is still full of people you can identify as misrulers.  In your mind, consciousness slowly takes shape in the form of marbles scattered about.  Each marble marks a place where time is being abused.  What time of day should a marble be dropped?  The notion of an ideal alignment keeps you up at night.  The time is mucky.
