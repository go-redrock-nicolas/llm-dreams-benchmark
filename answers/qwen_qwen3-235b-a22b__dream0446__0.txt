I am dreaming. Or at least, I think I am.

The very air feels subtly *wrong*, as if the fabric of existence had been lovingly hand-stitched, then stretched just slightly out of shape by a lazy god. The sky is not a sky—it’s more like a breathing ceiling of violet velvet, pulsing slowly to the rhythm of something ancient, like a heartbeat felt through dreams. I’m standing at the edge of a forest that moves when looked at sideways, trees melting away like candle wax only to reform a moment later into new, impossible geometries.

I should run. Or look away. Or scream, even just to test if sound still works in this place, but I can’t. I am utterly, agonizingly still—not through fear, not even through enchantment—but by the *weight* of a choice before me that should mean nothing, and yet burns white-hot with consequence.

Before me lie two paths—one paved with mirrors that buzz like wasps, and one made entirely out of quills that grow and retract with every breath-like swell of the ground below. I haven't come to a fork in the road... no. This place has no patience for roads.

At my feet rests a single creature—neither bird nor beast, but something woven of thread and flame, its eyes pools of staring salt water. It looks up at me without hunger, without expectation—only awareness.

I must choose.

Do I step into the mirrored path which, from time to time, lets out muffled whispers of who I *was*? Or the quill path that periodically pulses with horrid laughter—laughter I swear I've uttered in other lives?

Why does it matter?

This shouldn’t be hard. These aren’t life or death choices. They are less rational than that—less measurable. 

And still I freeze.

Not out of fear. Not quite. It’s something stranger. A flood of emotion I can’t name, a tangled mass of *everything*—desire, regret, shame, joy—all clamoring to be felt at once. As if each choice were a door offering destruction or revelation, and I am too frightened, too *entangled*, to face what I might become on the other side.

Even my thoughts echo oddly here. Insistent whispers echo through my skull—not from *me*, I think—obscure warnings curled like smoke:

> “You always run. Even now, in a dream, you *run*. But here, there's no place to run to. There's only a choice. Will your soul bear the weight of it?”

I want to speak, but my tongue tastes like silk and ash, like words are forbidden here unless earned.

The creature at my feet tilts its capricious head—only slightly—and does not blink. It is waiting. The world itself is waiting. The wet eyes of the thing hold galaxies that do not belong to any heaven I've ever known.

Why am I like this? Why does every dream become a trial at the altar of my own poor judgment? Why do I falter before an outcome I can’t possibly define, paralyzed not by fear...

...but by a gnawing certainty:

Whatever I choose, a part of me will not survive it.

That’s when I realize this dream was never about *choosing the right path*.

It was not even about the dream.

It was about something buried deeper—something real—and the indecision wasn’t *about* *this* moment.

It was about a thousand smaller choices stacking up like tombstones in my psyche.

And the paralysis wasn’t magic.

It was *me*. I had conjured the stillness. I had lit the breadcrumbs of doubt, scattered them like stars, until even a step forward felt like betrayal.

The dream began to ripple like a disturbed pond.

The creature blinked.

A single tear of burning ice ran down its cheek.

I woke up.

Still unsure. Still *there*, somehow. Still not knowing which path I chose—but knowing it had chosen me.
