I am dreaming. I'm standing in a glass-walled command center perched atop a skyscraper overlooking a sprawling metropolis. Digital maps flicker across transparent screens showing multiple crisis points glowing red across the city. The floor trembles beneath my feet as another aftershock ripples through the building.

"The hospital district is flooding," says a voice beside me. My assistant's face is drawn with exhaustion, her eyes reflecting the emergency lights pulsing overhead.

Three separate disasters converge in cruel synchronicity: an earthquake has ruptured gas lines causing scattered fires, while unprecedented rainfall overwhelms the city's century-old drainage system. The downtown water treatment plant is compromised, and toxic chemicals have leaked into the rising floodwaters.

My earpiece crackles. "This is the Mayor. I need all resources diverted to protect the financial district immediately."

Before I can respond, another voice cuts through: "Governor here. Countermand that order. Focus evacuation efforts on the western suburbs."

The screens show me the impossible math of our situation: emergency vehicles stuck in gridlocked streets, shelters reaching capacity, and only enough medical supplies to last another twelve hours. Each decision I make saves lives in one district while abandoning another.

A helicopter hovers outside the window, rotors beating against the strengthening storm winds. A senator I recognize from morning news shows gestures urgently for me to board.

"You need to prioritize," my assistant whispers, handing me the final emergency protocol folder. "We don't have enough for everyone."

The weight of these impossible choices presses down on me as faces of countless strangers flash across the screens, all looking toward my command center, waiting for salvation that cannot reach them all...
