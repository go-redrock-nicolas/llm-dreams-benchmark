I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in the center of a vast, cathedral-like chamber built entirely of glowing screens. The walls ripple with social-media feeds — each tile flickers with friends’ smiling faces, headlines burning in neon, half-read articles scrolling endlessly upward. Underfoot, the floor is a mosaic of smashed smartphone glass, each shard humming with a tiny notification echo. You notice your reflection in one panel: tired eyes rimmed with pixel-blue light, fingers twitching toward an unseen device. Your chest tightens as a phantom vibration thrums through your spine.

A chorus of pings and buzzes rises around you, forming a humming tide that lifts you off your feet. You drift upward, carried by waves of alerts morphing into swarming fireflies of data, each orb pulsing with a single word — “Like,” “Share,” “Comment,” “Now.” With every whisper of light against your skin, you feel your heartbeat synchronize to the algorithm’s rhythm, faster and faster, until your breath shards into fragmented gasps. You reach out to catch one of the glowing motes, but it flares out in a burst of static and stings your palm with the sharp tang of regret.

The hive of notifications splits apart like a horizon of fractured glass, and you tumble through the gap into a contrasting realm. Here, giant analog clocks sprout like mushrooms from moss–carpeted earth, each tick rolling across the forest floor like distant thunder. Vines fashioned from old cassette tapes coil around tree trunks, their leafy ends shimmering under a pastel dawn. You take a hesitant step, and the ground sighs beneath your weight—every footstep presses down on minutes you once lost scrolling, minutes you can reclaim.

A gentle breeze stirs the leaves, carrying the sweet scent of rain-soaked soil. You look down to see your hands no longer trembling for a screen, but cupped around a single dewdrop that reflects the sky. In that drop, you glimpse your life: friendships deepened by real laughter, sunsets watched through unfiltered eyes, the steady rise and fall of your own breath. You raise it to your lips and taste freedom. As the dewdrop dissolves, the forest around you brightens, colors intensify, and you feel a warm pulse of clarity in your chest.

Slowly, the dreamscape shifts again. The violet dusk of the screen-hall returns, but now the panels are blank—mirrors showing only you, unmediated and whole. You press a palm to one mirror and feel cool truth seep through your skin: that real connection lies not in endless swiping, but in the moments you choose to step away. Notification lights fade into distant stars overhead. You tilt your head back, inhaling the hush of midnight air, and in that silence you promise: tomorrow, you will reclaim your time. You will live untethered to the glow of glass, awake to the full spectrum of your own world—and you will savor it, moment by incandescent moment.
