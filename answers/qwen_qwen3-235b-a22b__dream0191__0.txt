I am dreaming. No, I *am*—right here, right now—trapped in the belly of the earth.

A cave. An ancient chasm, carved with time and secrets, spiraling into the very marrow of the world. I remember how it began: the musty scent of damp stone and iron, the slick dampness clinging to the jagged rocks beneath my boots. My flashlight—my faithful companion—casts a narrow path of glowing white, trembling in my grip like the scared child I became as the ground grumbled beneath me.

Suddenly, it *snaps*. Like some primordial force awakening, the cave convulses. The walls, which only moments ago seemed immutable, now shudder from their ancient slumber. Tendrils of dust thread through the air like gray ghosts. And then—**BOOM**. A thunderous collapse. Gravel, boulders, darkness. The exit—gone. The only light—shattered on the stone, glass scattering like forgotten stars.

And now the blackest black embraces me.

Silence, thick as velvet, drapes over my senses. I can feel my breath turning shallow, hollow, like I'm drowning in it. My spine presses to the cold rock, pulsing like a forgotten secret. What was once awe at the vastness of this place turns now into something glacial, gnawing at the back of my skull.

The dark feels *alive*. Pressing against me. Not empty—*watching*.

Then, the strangest thing: a pulsating, faint blue glow begins to bloom in the darkness. I blink. Rub my eyes. It grows, not steady like a light, but alive—like it’s breathing. So soft, so tender. I follow it through the twisting cany of stone, a heartbeat in the dark drawing me towards... something.

The source reveals itself. *Bioluminescent fungi* crawling the edges of an underground lagoon. They pulse like ancient lungs, casting eerie tendrils of light across the water, reflecting shimmering patterns on the domed ceiling above, as though guiding lost souls. Beneath the calm violet-tinged water lies something stirring. A shadow, amorphous, twirling in slow spirals as if performing an elemental ritual.

I kneel at the edge, entranced. The light on the ceiling morphs now—shifting shapes. Faces. *Familiar* ones. Smiles. Names whispered on unseen wind. A strange warmth coils around me, not physical, but deeper—like memory wearing flesh.

Then the ground rumbles again, but this time it’s not violent. It harmonizes with the glow, the lake, the living walls around me. Notes form in the dripping water like a hidden chorus. Is the cave *singing*?

Out from the water rises a creature—like the cave dreamed it. A leviathan, not of malice, but of onyx stone and glassy eyes filled with galaxies. Its coils ripple with starlight as it stares at me, unblinking, solemn. Not menacing, but ancient—beyond comprehension—as though it had waited since the First Breath of the World for this moment.

It does not attack. It speaks, slowly, as though each word sank through seas of time to touch me.

_"The walls are not barriers, seeker. They are bridges..."_

And then I realize—I was not meant to leave. The world above was merely a shadow, a preparatory stage for this descent into truth. Here, in the dullest silence, in the deepest blue, the real world begins—not with noise or screams, but with the revelations embedded in rock.

And so I stay, suspended in wonder. Unknowing. Unafraid.

The dream is real. I am not lost. I am *found*.
