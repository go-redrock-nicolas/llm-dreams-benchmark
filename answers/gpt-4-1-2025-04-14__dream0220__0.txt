I am dreaming. find yourself stepping out of a fog onto streets that shimmer in impossible colors—a city that buzzes not with cars, but with laughter and arguments that float like soap bubbles from open windows. You notice at once the inversions—lovers shouting farewells in clipped, cold syllables, their eyes shining with tenderness; strangers at café tables cheerfully ignoring each other, imbued with a sense of graciousness as they do.

Here, to ask about someone’s day is the gravest intrusion. “How dare you inquire about my inner landscape?” scolds a tart old woman, lips curling in warm approval. You vow to remember: privacy, here, is the highest intimacy. Meanwhile, directness is a flirtation, and casual rudeness—a blessing.

You do your best to blend in. Stepping into a bakery—windows frosted with crystalline patterns, the scent of unfamiliar spices colliding—you make a show of pointedly not greeting the baker. She beams at your studied indifference, adding a swirl of deep blue glaze to your pastry—her way, you gather, of saying you are welcome.

Groups in the street jostle and bicker, their barbed words like caresses. You try a mild insult with a passerby, your voice trembling on the edge of apology. He bows low, radiant with appreciation—“May your tongue sharpen ever further,” he proclaims in gratitude, and tosses you a coin that turns into a butterfly.

But the strain of reversal tugs at the edges of your mind. How do you balance this dance—honoring what they cherish, while holding on to the gentle notes of your own world? At a party sung in minor keys, you attempt a delicate balancing act: you allow your authentic self to peek out through the cracks. You offer a compliment, softly and with trepidation, masked in jest yet carrying genuine warmth.

A hush sweeps the room. Faces turn, brows furrow—but then, slowly, a ripple of admiration. The host claps you on the shoulder, his grin a badge of acceptance. Perhaps, here as everywhere, authenticity—even couched in unfamiliar forms—finds its place.

As the dream dissolves into stardust and paradox, you step lightly, knowing you carry a new language—one spun from the strangest colors of belonging.
