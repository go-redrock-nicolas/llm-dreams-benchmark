I am dreaming. In the depths of the night, I drift into an unsettling dream. The shadows lengthen and writhe about me in the darkness. I find myself in a vast, barren landscape, an endless expanse of cracked earth and withered trees stretching to the gray horizon. An unsettling fog clings to everything, vague whispers emanating from the mist.

Ahead, a towering structure looms - a crumbling ruin, once a grand fortress, now a decayed shell. I approach cautiously, my heart pounding in my chest. As I draw near, I realize the fortress is honeycombed with narrow tunnels and passageways. An ominous feeling washes over me as I glimpse movement in the shadows.

"Who's there?" My voice echoes eerily, swallowed by the darkness. No reply comes. Only a sinister chuckle fades into the distance. Before I can react, a ghostly hand reaches out from a darkened passage, ensnaring my ankle in a vice-like grip. I struggle against it but the fingers are iron and refuse to release their hold.

Pulling steadily, the unseen assailant yanks me further into the fortress, down into the ever-deepening tunnels. The air becomes musty and damp as I descend. Candlelight flickers, illuminating a macabre scene before me. Skeletal figures sit at a long, rotting table, nibbling on decayed food. I am led to an empty chair at the head of the table. The skeletons turn as one and fix their hollow eye sockets upon me. Their jaws snap open and close, producing a chorus of groaning moans. The creature that grabbed me pushes me to sit, joining the others in the silent simpering ceremony.

Helpless and terrified, I can only stare at the group of ghouls, my mind whirling with fear and revulsion. Suddenly, the scene shifts and I am back in the barren, wind-swept landscape. I realize I am running - racing for my life as churning black clouds boil across the sky, a thunderous roar rising from behind me. I look back and my blood runs cold. A massive Swarm of evil flying creatures spills over the edge of the earth like a plague of locusts, darkening the sun. They appear to defy gravity, weaving and diving with unsettling ease - a writhing, flowing sea of death.

I run harder than I ever have before, my legs burning with exertion. The Swarm gains on me inexorably, their talons reaching out to ensnare me even as I flee. I trip and stumble, my bare feet cutting on the jagged rocks. I stagger back to my feet as the Swarm descends upon me, enveloping me in their suffocating embrace...

"... and I awake with a jolt, my heart racing and skin slick with cold sweat. Panting heavily, I lie there in bed, trying to shake the horrible images from my mind. Normally my nightmares fade away completely once I open my eyes - but not this time. The lingering terror from the dream clings to me like a shroud, coloring everything I do and think. 

A numbing dread seems to have settled into my chest even after the sun has fully risen and the morning light streams into the bedroom. The arcane images and sense of foreboding I experienced cannot be banished, no matter how hard I shake my head and try to convince myself it was just an episode of sleep terror. I know that the rational part of me must be the one in control, but a part of me feels as if some ethereal gateway opened in that dream and now the things that were on the other side... they know my name now.

As I close my eyes, I see again the warped structures of the nightmare fortress, the phantasmagoric meal with the skeletons, the inexorable Swarm snuffing out the sun and life itself. I shuddered, curling under the covers, trying in vain to feel the security I once would have found there. Turning my face into the pillow, I fought back tears, trying to shut it all out. The bizarre, nightmare imagery echoed in my brain unbidden. 

Taking a deep breath, I tried to ground myself in reality, in logic. This must just be stress, a breakdown of my subconscious, brought on by the chaos and unease of the external world somehow finding its way into my unconscious. I must shake this feeling off. It's just a dream. It doesn't mean anything. Rubbing my face, I got up. Another day, I thought. Time to face the waking world, disturbed but unbroken...

"The rest of the day passes in a fog, I can't focus on work, on conversation, on anything that tries to divert my attention. The dream lurks in the peripherals of my thoughts like a patient predator waiting to pounce, bringing with it the unsettling emotions I experienced. Whenever I close my eyes, I see the nightmare fortress, the noxious Swarm. Every shadow and movement startles me, my nerves wound tight. For the rest of the day I jump at nothing, until I can't take it anymore and have to escape.

"Locking myself in the bathroom, I sit cross-legged on the floor and focus on breathing. I try deep, calming breaths - but the visions return, as if my brain is determined to reconjure the entirety of that terror. The fortress, the skeletons, the Swarm - each bleak image replays in my mind with vivid, traumatizing clarity. 

"I feel like I'm losing a grip on the line between dream and reality. Before me, the head of a Skeleton points its hollow eyes into me, like a judgmental specter. An icy chill runs through my body and I nearly gasp out loud. Gulping, I open my eyes, my knees shaking. Raising a hand to my pounding head, I waver on my feet, cursing the uncontrollable imagination my subconscious has unleashed...

"Calm. I must be calm. This was just one bad episode. I know in my head this, I do...but try as I might to quell my violent imaginings, an insidious part of me knows the truth. That this experience has forever marked me as a victim.

"Finally exiting the bathroom, I see a creature from the Swarm perched on my bedroom wall, its insectic eyes blazing with malevolent intelligence and barely contained hunger for my life. The scream building in my throat becomes a low whine as my legs give out.

"Shaking my head, I stagger to the couch and collapse, my last bit of strength draining away. I know I am still alive, that everything I'm seeing is just a hallucination, but I can't get my body to respond. The longer I am a victim of this trauma, the less I feel like there is any hope of escape. The day wanes into night, and as I sleep on the couch, I can feel the deathly whisperings of my darkened mind, waiting once again to devolve me into yet another nightmare like the last."
