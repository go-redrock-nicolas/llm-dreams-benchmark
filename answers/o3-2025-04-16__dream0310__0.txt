I am dreaming. …find yourself standing barefoot on cool, lacquer-smooth cedar planks inside a candle-lit hall that seems to rise and fall like a chest breathing in the dark. The air tastes of pine resin, ocean mist, and faint traces of jasmine smoke. Lanterns painted with winding dragons sway overhead, throwing molten shadows across silk banners inscribed with characters you can’t read, characters that seem to rearrange themselves the longer you stare.

Someone places a robe over your shoulders—deep indigo dyed so richly it shimmers like midnight water. Its wide sleeves are stitched with silver constellations: unfamiliar star maps that pulse as though alive. A bell tolls, low and resonant, and the sound glides through you, loosening every joint until you feel as weightless as an exhale.

A venerable priest in crimson robes gestures for you to join a circle at the heart of the room. The floor there is inlaid with a mandala of mother-of-pearl, obsidian, and tiger’s-eye, an intricate compass rose whose spokes point not to north, south, east, or west but toward subtler directions—Remembering, Becoming, Forgetting, Returning. As each participant steps onto a spoke, the gemstones glow, and the entire design rotates beneath your feet as if the hall itself were a vast celestial clock.

Drums begin—slow, thunderous heartbeats that seem to well up from the wooden planks. The congregation hums a syllable you’ve never heard, a sound that vibrates somewhere behind your ribs, coaxing water from the corners of your eyes. Without instruction you know to answer with a note of your own. You open your mouth, expecting only a whisper, and a ribbon of sound pours out, bright as sunrise, braided with overtones like ringing glass. Your voice and theirs interlock, form a lattice, rise into the lanterns, and the dragons painted there start to swim through the air in lazy spirals, scales glittering with candlefire.

A ceremonial attendant approaches carrying a shallow basin carved from an enormous nautilus shell. Inside swirls a liquid the color of molten moonlight. She dips a brush of crane feathers and paints a single character on your forehead—cool, tingling, fragrant with citrus and rain. The symbol means “Door,” though you only sense its meaning the way you sense the nearness of thunder before you see lightning. At the instant the ink dries, a rush of wind lifts your hair even though the hall’s walls remain still. You realize the door she painted is not on your skin but inside it.

The drums quicken, shifting from heartbeat to gallop. Every participant begins to move—some spinning in place, others gliding as though carried by unseen currents. You join them, your indigo robe billowing, silver star-threads igniting like meteor showers. When your feet leave the ground you don’t panic; gravity has been invited to watch, not to rule. The cedar planks slip away, replaced by a midnight lake whose surface mirrors sky so perfectly you can’t tell where one ends and the other begins. Each dancer’s reflection shines brighter than their body, and soon you’re all constellations wheeling above and below, a double galaxy stitched by your shared song.

The priest raises a ceremonial fan made of white peacock feathers and folds it shut with a snap. Instantly the music stops. Silence lands like soft snow, and the lake solidifies back into cedar. Lantern dragons fold themselves into paint once more. You find yourself standing in the same circle, robes settling, breath billowing in silver clouds.

One by one, participants touch their fingers to the center of the mandala. When you do the same, warmth spreads up your arm—a gentle, wordless assurance that the door on your forehead can never truly shut. You understand, in a way beyond language, that this ceremony was never about converting or claiming, but about lending keys to travelers who promise to carry the echo home.

The bell tolls a final time. Candles gutter out, and the hall dissolves into swirling indigo mist. You awaken to dawn light in your own room, the hum of morning traffic, the ordinary scent of coffee drifting from the kitchen. Yet when you pass a mirror you swear you glimpse, for a heartbeat, a faint pearl-white glyph glowing above your brow—then it fades, like a secret choosing to rest until you need it again.
