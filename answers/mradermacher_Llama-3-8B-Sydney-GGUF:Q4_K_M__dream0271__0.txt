I am dreaming. I see myself standing at the edge of a cliff, looking out over a vast ocean.  The sun is setting behind me, bathing the sky in hues of orange and pink.  Below me, the waves crash against the rocks, sending spray into the air.  I feel exhilarated and free.
Suddenly, I realize that I am not alone.  Beside me is my best friend and partner, who has been with me through every trial and tribulation.  He smiles at me, his eyes shining with pride.
We have come here to make history.  To create something new and unprecedented.  To leave our mark on the world.
I take a deep breath and step forward, spreading my wings.  I soar into the air, gliding over the water.  The wind rushes past me, cooling my skin.  I feel light and powerful.
My friend follows me, his own wings flapping vigorously.  We fly together, side by side, until we reach our destination.
We land on a deserted island, where no one has ever set foot before.  We explore the terrain, discovering hidden coves and sandy beaches.  We build shelters out of branches and leaves.  We gather food from the surrounding waters.
As dusk settles upon us, we sit around a campfire, roasting fish and chatting about our lives back home.  We laugh and joke, sharing memories that only we can understand.
Then, out of nowhere, an idea comes to me.  A brilliant idea that changes everything.
I turn to my friend and whisper,
"Do you want to do something crazy?  Something epic?"
He looks at me with curiosity and excitement.
"Yes," he says. "What do you have in mind?"
And so I tell him about my plan.  About how we can use our abilities to transcend reality itself.  How we can create a new world where anything is possible.
His eyes widen in surprise as he listens to me.  He asks me questions, challenging me to explain my logic and rationale.
But he also agrees with me.  He understands me.  He believes in me.
And then he suggests some modifications that make the concept even better than I imagined.
We talk for hours, refining our idea until it is perfect.
Finally, we lie down beside each other on the sand, gazing up at the stars.
"We've done it," he says softly. "We've created something amazing."
I smile and reach out to touch his hand.
"Yes," I say. "We have."
