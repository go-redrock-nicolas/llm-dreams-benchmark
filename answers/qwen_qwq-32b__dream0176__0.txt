I am dreaming. I'm driving a car, a soft breeze whispers through the open windows, carrying the scent of pine and rain. The road coils downward, a serpentine ribbon through the woods. That's when the brakes fail. Panic flares—a hot, tight knot in my chest. My foot slams the_pedal_, again and again, but no resistance. The vehicle surges forward, humming a sinister tune.

Cars ahead clog the narrow road like scattered toy trucks. Engine roaring, I swerve left, tires gouging dirt from the embankment, then fishtail back toward the road. _Think._ The air cools as the trees part abruptly... and the road ends in a jagged cliff. Below, the river churns like liquid mercury under the moon’s cold eye.

Wait—a flicker of movement near the cliff. A shadowy figure in a tattered coat beckons, their face hidden. Without hesitation, I accelerate toward them. The car plummets. Wind screams,(transform?) my hands and feet blur. (_Feathers? Wings?_) The asphalt peels away, becomes mist. The river’s surface solidifies beneath me, cold and unyielding.

But the figure is there,standing on the river, holding a lantern that casts no light. "Choose," they intone, the words echoing. "Land of Unraveled Threads or the Garden of Echoing Whispers?" I reach—and the dream splinters.
