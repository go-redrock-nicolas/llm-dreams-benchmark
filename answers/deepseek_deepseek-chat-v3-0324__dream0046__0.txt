I am dreaming. **You are dreaming.**

The air tastes metallic, like ozone after a thunderstorm—but the sky is clear, a bruise-purple twilight smeared with slow-drifting stars. At first, everything seems normal: the murmur of a crowded subway station, the flicker of LED billboards, strangers scrolling through their phones. Then the signs begin.  

A pigeon drops mid-flight, dead before it hits the pavement. No one notices. The digital clock above the platform glitches, numbers melting like wet ink—**13:88**. Your reflection in a shop window blinks when you don’t. The scent of burnt hair curls from an alleyway where a homeless man whispers to a broken payphone, *"They’re folding the streets again."* 

Then—silence. The crowd freezes mid-step. A woman’s coffee cup hangs in the air, liquid suspended like amber. Static crawls up your spine. On the tracks below, the darkness *twitches*. It’s not a train coming. It’s something hunched and many-limbed, unfolding itself from the tunnel’s throat, vibrating at a frequency that makes your teeth ache.  

No one else sees it.  

Your heartbeat thunders in your ears, drowning out the distant scream of twisting metal. *Run.* But the exit signs are gone. The corridors stretch, endless funhouse mirrors reflecting a version of you with hollowed-out eyes. The thing on the tracks tilts its head—*not a head, not a face*—and you realize:  

This isn’t a warning.  

*You’re already inside it.*
