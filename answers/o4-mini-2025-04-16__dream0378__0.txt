I am dreaming. I close my eyes—and suddenly I’m afloat above a city built of living crystal, each tower humming with color. Beneath me, streets glimmer like refracted starlight, and the air tastes faintly of wild mint and sea foam. I am a stranger here, wrapped in a robe woven from pale moon-wool, its fibers shifting hues whenever I move. I do not understand the rules of this place, yet somehow I know I must learn or risk offending those I meet.

As I drift down onto a broad terrace, a circle of villagers greets me. They bear skin patterns that pulse softly—lines of bioluminescence tracing their arms in living tattoos. One extends a slender hand; another arches a forehead jewel. I do not know whether to bow, nod, or speak. So I close my eyes, take a breath of mint-sea air, and let my shoulders loosen. I uncurl my fingers, hold my hand open, palm upward. A silent invitation.

They laugh—liquid chimes—and the jewel on the elder’s brow brightens. Around us, faint music rises: a polyphony of wind-whistles and shifting stones. I try to join in, lifting my voice in a gentle hum. The notes tangle and sprawl, but they do not judge; they simply guide me to a rising tone. I follow, uncertain at first, then more boldly, until I’m weaving sound into their chorus.

They beckon me to walk the Hall of Tides, where each step changes the floor’s pattern. The tiles ripple from cerulean to sunset coral with every footfall. At first I tiptoe, afraid I’ll offend the currents; but they clap their bioluminescent hands, encouraging me to press on—and soon I’m dancing, trusting the tiles to speak their own language.

At the end of the hall stands a towering basin of water—a communal mirror. Each person steps forward, dips two fingers in, and then paints a symbol on a smooth black stone. The symbols glow for a moment—tiny stories of gratitude, memory, hope—before fading into the night. I hesitate. I do not know their pictograms. But I watch closely: one elder traces a looping spiral to honor safe journeys, another draws a fractal to celebrate harvest. Taking a breath, I lift water, and let it drip in a curved line across my stone’s surface. The glow blooms—warm amber—meaning “new friend.”

A hush settles. The villagers lean in, their tattoos pulsing slower, like a shared heartbeat. I’m filled with relief: my gesture was received without judgment. They reach out, place hands on my shoulder, and suddenly I sense their values—honor in community, respect through patience, celebration in small acts of creativity.  

Later, I’m led to feast beneath a canopy of floating lanterns shaped like drifting jellyfish. Communal dishes appear, each more astonishing than the last: fruit that tastes of starlight, soup that ripples with soft laughter, pastries stamped with the day’s omens. I don’t know the words for “thank you,” so instead I close my eyes and press both palms against my heart. My host inclines her head, and together we share a moment of understanding deeper than any phrase.

When I awaken, the hum of crystal towers still rings in my ears, and on my palm I find the faint, warm trace of that glowing spiral—proof that in a world whose rules I did not know, kindness and openness became my guide.
