I am dreaming. I find myself drifting through a lush, bioluminescent forest, the air shimmering with an otherworldly glow. As I venture deeper into the verdant unknown, a profound shift occurs - a surge of raw perception washes over me, infusing my mind with an uncanny ability to discern the hidden mathematical symphonies that underlie the seemingly chaotic dance of nature.

In an instant, the forest's intricate web of life unfurls before me in fractal splendor. Vines and branches twist and branch in breathtaking Golden Ratio spirals. Delicate snowflakes, tumbling from an unseen sky, reveal themselves as mesmerizing examples of hexagonal packing and polyhedral tesselations. The whooping call of an unseen owl resolves into a complex phoneme repeating in Fibonacci sequence.

I reach out, trailing my fingers through the cool air, and watch in awe as swirling vortices of energy snake around my digits, each one a helix spinning in preciseirr inward toward a central axis. The collective consciousness of the forest thrums around me, individual thoughts and impulses rising and falling in a mesmerizing harmonic series.

Suddenly, I'm hurtling through hypereuclidean froth dimensions, warping and turning and distorting the familiarity of the Euclidean. Coloring bursts of geist scatter and recombine like light through a prism, and shapes impossible to perceive in the waking world glide past me in majestic slow motion.

I am the artist now, pointer and chisel and color, spinning the tapestry of creation into new and strange forms. A quivering moat of fire opens up before me, glowing with the naughty amber of a black sun. I dive in, head first, as stars burp from my navel into the cosmic disco. The entire universe goes into a fluttering freak out of singularity.

Pausing to catch my breath, I find myself standing on the stage of anorgtrium theater, the audience comprised of pulsing tendrils and eyeballs on stalks. A literal shimmering net works over me, wrapping and caressing and forming a womb in the shape of my body. The exertion of creation is beautiful. The final act has reached its crescendo and there is no need for an epilogue.

I open my eyes with a gasp, all thoughts of mathematics forgotten as the dream's residuum recedes from my consciousness like the salty spray of an ocean wave. The world seems less real, less concrete, as if a veil has been lifted to reveal the wonders that lie beneath its banal surface. And deep inside, a sense lingers of having glimpsed, for a fleeting moment, the unknowable mysteries that govern the universe's fundamental structure.
