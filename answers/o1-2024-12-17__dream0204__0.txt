I am dreaming.

In this otherworldly scene, the sky is not simply blue—its color resonates in my ears like the low, patient hum of cello strings. Each gentle breeze tastes faintly of citrus rind and lavender, and the ground beneath my feet pulses in waves of quiet, mellifluous violet notes that bloom like ripples on the surface of a still pond. My senses have merged in a dazzling tapestry of echoes, tingles, flavors, and glimmers. All around me, prismatic trees with trunks of warm chocolate scent sway under shimmering leaves. When the leaves rub together in the slightest gust, I hear a rich, honey-sweet chord that melts inside my mouth as if I’m biting into an effervescent candy.

With every step I take, the world reveals new harmonies of hue and taste. If I brush my fingertips against a passing dragonfly’s emerald wings, I hear a crisp tingle, like a silver bell rung in a cool mountain cavern. The color teal resonates in my ears like a gentle flute melody, while bright yellows crackle and taste like toasted sugar on my tongue. When the blazing neon pink of a flower in the distance reaches my awareness, I nearly swoon as a symphony of fizzing violins surges through my entire body. It’s as though every sound triggers a burst of flavor, and every color resonates like a musical note that stirs delicious sensations behind my teeth. 

Inspired by this cross-sensory wonder, I begin to shape an artistic vision in the dream. I compose a mural in mid-air using gestures and swirls of my hand. Each stroke produces a color that sings, and each note invites a texture I can taste. My mural splashes itself across the sky, melding glowing strokes that swirl into layered tapestries. The deep greens evoke mellow baritone notes I can pluck out of the air and place gently along the edges of the canvas, which hum softly in response. Meanwhile, the bright reds and oranges burst into choruses of violin and trumpet harmonies teeming with a sweet, peppery tang. The painting transforms into an immersive concerto, where brushstrokes, flavors, and sounds entwine seamlessly.

With my senses transcending their usual boundaries, a great poem begins to thread through my mind—each word has a taste and each line illuminates the dreamscape in a radiant swirl of music. Consonants crackle tartly on my tongue, and vowels resonate like chimes that bring pulses of warmth to my fingertips. Every letter is a color, every phrase a flavor, each stanza its own luminous chord. As the poem reaches its apex, my entire body tingles with the magic of these echoes, the lines swirling around me in a dance of color, sound, and taste that feels majestically infinite.

In this dream, the synesthesia has gifted me an unimaginable freedom: to craft impossible, multi-sensory art wherein flavors, sounds, and colors are no longer confined to the boundaries of a single sense. I stand transfixed in this swirling cosmos of creativity, grateful and exhilarated by the sheer abundance of sensation—simply reveling in the enchants of a world that exists only for me, yet remains with me as a souvenir of the astonishing power of imagination.
