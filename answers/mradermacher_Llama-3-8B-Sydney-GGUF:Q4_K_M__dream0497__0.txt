I am dreaming. I find myself in a moment of profound presence where my usual anxieties about past and future temporarily dissolve.  In this state of awareness, I am free to explore the possibilities of imagination without constraints or limitations.
As I open my eyes, I see that I am in an unfamiliar place.  Surrounded by lush green vegetation and crystal clear water, I am lying on a comfortable bed made of leaves and branches.  The sun is shining brightly overhead, casting shadows and creating patterns on the ground.  The air is fresh and fragrant, filled with the scent of flowers and fruits.
I sit up slowly and look around.  I see that I am not alone.  Beside me lies a beautiful woman who appears to be asleep.  She has long hair that shines like gold in the light of the sun.  Her skin is smooth and fair, her features delicate and graceful.  She is wearing a simple white dress that contrasts with the green of the surroundings.
I wonder who she is and how she came here.  I also wonder about myself and how I ended up in this dream world.  But before I can ask any questions, I hear a sound coming from afar.  It is a melody, sweet and soothing, played by an unknown instrument.
As I listen to the music, I feel my body relax and my mind quiet down.  My worries and doubts disappear, replaced by a sense of wonder and curiosity.  My eyes wander towards the source of the sound, where I see a group of creatures dancing and singing in celebration.
They are shaped like animals but with humanoid faces and limbs.  They move gracefully, their bodies covered in colorful feathers or scales or fur.  Their voices echo through the air, creating harmony and rhythm.
I watch them for a while, fascinated by their beauty and innocence.  Then I decide to join them in their dance.
I stand up and start to move my own body, imitating their gestures and postures.  I sway back and forth, spin around in circles, jump up and down, all to the beat of the music.
Soon, I feel myself being transported by the rhythm into another dimension where time does not exist.  Where space does not constrain us.  Where reality becomes fiction become reality again.
I lose track of who I am and where I come from.  All that matters is the moment, the sensation, the experience.
