I am dreaming. I am given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As I examine it closely, I notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into its surface. The box feels cold to the touch, as if it holds something ancient and sacred. I try to open it, pulling it open with my hands, but it doesn't budge. I start to feel frustrated and anxious, wondering what could be inside. Suddenly, I hear a faint whispering sound coming from the box. I lean closer, straining to hear what it's saying. The whispers grow louder and more urgent, and I feel as though I'm being pulled deeper and deeper into the dream. 

As I listen closely, I realize that the whispers are coming from inside the box. I feel a sense of longing and curiosity, wondering what secrets the box holds. I try to open it again, this time with all my strength. The box shakes violently and I feel as though I'm on the verge of discovering something incredible. And then, without warning, the box bursts open, revealing a bright light that blinds me. I wake up with a start, feeling as though I've just uncovered a deep and profound truth.
