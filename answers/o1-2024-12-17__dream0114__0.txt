I am dreaming. I step into the retreat center with hesitant steps, feeling as though I’ve crossed a threshold into someplace both sacred and eerily familiar. The tall, triangular building is bathed in silver moonlight. Thick, ancient vines wrap around wooden columns like comforting arms. There is a smell in the air—sandalwood and rosemary, punctuated by a faint sweetness I can’t quite place. It smells like hope, and something that tastes like fear at the corners of my mouth.

As soon as I enter the main hall, I notice a ring of plush floor pillows arranged in a circle. They’re crimson and velvet, embroidered with gold-stitched spirals that seem to dance when I stare at them too hard. The large domed ceiling above me features a mural of constellations—some real, some entirely new, shimmering in an otherworldly palette of turquoise and violet. Moonlight filters through stained-glass windows, creating kaleidoscopes of color across the polished wood floor.

There’s a small group of people already seated: men, women, and individuals who—I just know, deep down—have hearts that carry stories similar to mine. Each person seems to radiate a quiet urgency, as if they’ve been longing to unburden themselves for far too long.

A woman with kind, dark eyes invites me to join them, her voice lilting like a gentle breeze. I sink onto a pillow, my breath hitching. My heart throbs in my chest. This is a place for healing, or so I pray.

Soon, one by one, people begin to share. A tall man with unruly black curls speaks first. He has spent years struggling with the same sense of isolation and shame that I’ve known so intimately. As he speaks, each raw emotion cracks open in his voice, pouring out in a crescendo of tears and release. An older woman in flowing lavender robes talks of feeling crushed by expectations—her parents’, her friends’, her own. She confesses to nights spent awake, questioning whether she’d ever be enough. Another person speaks up: a quiet individual whose words rise to the rafters like a forlorn bird seeking escape. They talk about the stifled panic that has followed them for years, gnawing at their peace like a relentless tide.

With every word each stranger offers, I feel a knot unfurling in my chest. It’s strangely comforting and utterly terrifying to hear echoes of my private struggles coming from the lips of people I’ve never met. This is therapy and confession, hope and heartbreak, all swirling in the charged circle. The air around us feels electric, vibrating with the powerful resonance of truth.

A shiver runs through me. I wonder if they can sense the mix of relief and vulnerability coursing through my veins. These are strangers, yet their lives run parallel to mine in unnerving ways. I can’t tell if tears are forming because of empathy or because some part of my bottled-up pain finally sees a sliver of daylight.

Eventually, it is my turn. My breath catches in my throat, and I close my eyes briefly. In the emptiness of that dark moment, “Share,” my heart demands. But I’m scared. Perhaps I fear judgment, or maybe I’m worried that voicing my pain will force me to acknowledge it for real. When I open my eyes, though, I meet their gazes. No one looks away. No one flinches. All I sense is encouragement—silent, but palpable as a warm hand on my shoulder.

So I speak. My voice is shaky at first, as if the words have edges that catch in my throat. I tell them of the doubts that have lived under my skin like restless phantoms: the feeling of never measuring up, the shadows of nightmares that invade my sleep, the fear that I’m somehow irreparably broken. And with each moment that I let those words roll off my tongue, I feel tension peeling away from my bones, layer by layer.

A hush settles in the circle once I’ve finished. Silence, but not emptiness. It’s a profound silence, the kind that only comes when everyone in a group truly listens with their entire being. And in that moment, I feel less alone than I ever have. I can almost hear all of our hearts beating in unison, a pulsing wave of shared compassion.

Someone reaches across the circle and takes my hand. Their touch floods me with warmth I didn’t know I needed. It is a universe of understanding confined to a single gesture. My pulse steadies, and I realize the tears streaming down my face are not just tears of pain—they are tears of release, a joyous relief in discovering that I am truly seen.

In this dreamscape, time doesn’t flow as it does in the waking realm. Minutes expand into hours of sharing, purging, and embracing. My burdens feel lighter. I look around and see gentle smiles, eyes filled with empathy, and an almost palpable glow in each person’s aura. The room itself seems to brighten, and the swirling colors on the ceiling intensify—stars in the painted skies appear to sparkle with renewed life.

Eventually, the circle disperses. People hug, some quietly weep on each other’s shoulders, and others simply take a moment to breathe in the powerful transformation. I step outside into the star-filled night, crisp air filling my lungs. Beyond the retreat center, the expansive sky unfolds, deep and endless, as if promising infinite possibility.

I stand under a shimmering canopy of stars, and I feel no fear. The dream has shown me I’m not alone. Perhaps that is the most profound gift: to realize that in the shared unveiling of deep struggles, there is fellowship and an echo of hope that says, “You belong. You are worthy. You will be okay.”

The dream ends with me gazing up, letting the starlight wash over my face like a gentle rain, and in that moment, my heart brims with a sense of belonging I have never known. And although I know it’s only a dream, I hold tight to the truth it revealed, vowing to remember that no matter how private my pain might feel, there is always a hand reaching out to hold mine in understanding.
