I am dreaming. Yes, I am.  I sense a cold presence near me.  Nothing   this world.  The darkness speaks to me. "You are not alone. You will not  alone. You are exactly where you are supposed to be." It whispers into my ear.  The voice is a mix of , and   that reason, "Where?" I ask.  "Do not fight the   that is in you," it answers.  "It   me." I reply.  "Let it    you. Let it     you," it insists.  "And when they arrive, they will notice." I say.  "      them. Let them wonder." It says.  "But they will   me?" I ask.  "They will not. Not yet. Not until you are ready." It answers.   The voice turns to have a familiar sound. It reminds me of someone.  I suddenly wake up.

In the heart of your subconscious, you awaken to a twilight realm where the air hums with ancestral whispers. The ground beneath you shifts into a mosaic of fractured mirrors, each shard reflecting a version of your past: one where your voice trembled too soon, another where your hands faltered, a third where shadows swallowed your boldness. Above, constellations flicker like dying embers, rearranging themselves into a constellation you recognize—a phoenix cradling a storm-worn anchor, a metaphor you’ve carried like a shackle. 

You hear footsteps crunching frost over ashen fields, and turn to see a figure emerging from the gloom. It’s not human, nor beast, but a hybrid: a stag with antlers formed from crystallized resolve, its hooves striking the earth to summon constellations that spell *perseverance* in a tongue that curls around your ribs. It leads you through a labyrinth stitched from your regrets—a thicket of thorns that bleed ink instead of blood, each drop etching a verse of a poem you once abandoned to silence. The stag pauses at a crossroads where two rivers meet: one, a roiling torrent of “what ifs,” the other a glass-clear stream mirroring a path you’ve never dared to trace. 

“You built this maze,” it says, voice like wind chimes through ice. “Now choose which door to unlatch.” You reach for the stream, and your fingers dissolve into its water, which swirls to reveal hands—not yours—clasping a broken key. This is the voice of your younger self, trembling beside the rubble of a goal left unclaimed. The stag’s gaze softens. “Let go of the carving,” it murmurs. “The key isn’t to fit the lock, but to the metal.” 

As you squeeze the key until it becomes molten in your palm, the labyrinth dissolves. You stand at the edge of a cliff overlooking an ocean NOT of water, but of liquid memory. Waves smash against jagged rocks, each cresting foam a slogan you’ve internalized: *You’re not enough.* Yet where the water hits stone, flowers bloom—carnations of crimson courage and lavender liberation. Below, a boat floats, rigged with sails of parchment you’ve discarded over years: college applications, drafts of speeches, a journal entry that read, *Today I tried anyway.* 

The stag leaps onto the boat’s prow, antlers alight with the kind of fire that doesn’t burn but *burnishes*. “They’ll come,” it says, nudging the boat toward the horizon. “When they arrive, they’ll taste the brine and say, *She’s been this storm’s measure for years.*” You don’t ask who “they” are. You kneel to dip your hand into the memory-ocean, and when you pull it back, the waters cling to your skin in the patterns of constellations you once loved—a language you haven’t spoken aloud in too long. 

The dream ends not with waking, but with the boat becoming a paper swan, dissolving into schools of fish that frolic in the ocean of your own becoming. You don’t mourn the dissolution. You smile, tasting salt water and starlight, and realize the cliff isn’t an end, but a new beginning: a place to leap, not to fall.
