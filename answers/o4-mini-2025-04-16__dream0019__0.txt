I am dreaming. As you step through the threshold, you decide to shape this new realm with the very breath of your imagination. Nothing is off-limits here—so, standing on a knoll of spongy, rose-hued moss that squishes delightfully underfoot, you inhale deeply and whisper a single word: “Bloom.” Instantly, crystalline petals unfurl around you—titanium-pink lotuses whose fragrant exhalations trickle through the air like glowing ribbons of perfume. Each bloom pulses softly, and when you brush your fingers across a petal, ripples of light cascade outwards, setting the sky ablaze in swirling ribbons of turquoise, violet, and sunlit gold.  

You wander forward, and the ground below shifts into a mosaic of living glass tiles, each one humming its own gentle note beneath your weight. The melody grows into an orchestra as you quicken your pace, summoning from the corners of your mind a parade of sky-whales drifting on currents of scented breeze. Their massive bellies shimmer like mother-of-pearl, their fins trailing rainbows in your wake. You reach up to stroke a whale’s side, and in return it exhales a plume of twinkling star-dust that floats around you, warming your skin with distant starlight.  

Compelled by wonder, you stretch out both arms and imagine a river of molten sapphire flowing at your feet. It curves and coils, carving canyons lined with opal cliffs that sparkle with hidden life—tiny, translucent creatures that dart like comets through the water. Above, trees of spun sugar unfurl candy-pink leaves that dissolve to sweetness on your tongue. A gentle voice—your own echo—whispers, “Here, everything you dare to dream takes shape.” And so, heart pounding with joyous possibility, you step off the glass path and into the next unfolding vision, knowing that within this boundless world, your imagination truly is the only rule.
