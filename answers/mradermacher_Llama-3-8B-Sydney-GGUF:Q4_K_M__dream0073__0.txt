I am dreaming. I am in control of my dreams and I can create any world I want.  Today, I decide to make it a happy one filled with colors and sounds that
make me feel good.  

I see myself flying over a beautiful landscape covered in flowers and trees.  The air is sweet and scented by the blooming petals around me.
Down below, I can see people living their lives peacefully without any worries or problems.  They are happy, content, and free.

As I fly closer to them, I realize that they cannot see me or hear me because I am not part of their reality.  But somehow, I know that they sense my presence
and presence brings joy to everyone who feels it.

I land gently near a group of children playing games outside school.  They look up at me with wide eyes and smiles that light up their faces.
Their innocence and curiosity touch my heart in ways words cannot describe.

I bend down so they can see me better and talk to them through our minds instead of voices.

Hello kids, do you want to play with me?
