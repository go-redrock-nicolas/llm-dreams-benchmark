I am dreaming. The subway car is a kaleidoscope of faces and bodies, a living tapestry woven from the threads of the city's daily hustle. People are crammed together, swaying rhythmically with the train's motion, lost in their own worlds of smartphones, books, or distant thoughts. The air is thick with the low hum of conversation, the rustle of newspapers, and the faint, metallic tang of the underground. Fluorescent lights overhead cast a sterile, unwavering glow, illuminating the shared space with an almost harsh clarity.

Suddenly, with a jarring lurch that sends ripples of imbalance through the packed car, the train grinds to a halt. The familiar rumble ceases, replaced by an unnerving silence. Then, plunging us into an absolute, impenetrable darkness, the lights extinguish simultaneously. A collective gasp ripples through the carriage, sharp and sudden, swallowed instantly by the void.

The darkness isn't just an absence of light; it feels heavy, tangible, like a thick velvet curtain dropped over reality. The familiar shapes of fellow passengers dissolve into unseen presences, their proximity now a source of vague unease rather than simple inconvenience. The air, once merely stuffy, now seems charged with an electric tension.

Panic, a insidious vine, begins to snake its way through the crowd. It starts as whispers, hushed questions slicing through the blackness. "What happened?" "Why did we stop?" The whispers grow louder, morphing into anxious murmurs, then sharp, frightened voices. A baby begins to cry, its wail piercing the oppressive silence, amplifying the fear. Someone near the door starts banging on it, the metallic clang echoing unnervingly in the confined space. The smell of fear, sharp and acrid, begins to mingle with the stale subway air.

My own heart hammers against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat in the sudden stillness. The darkness presses in, amplifying every sound, every shift of weight, every ragged breath drawn by the unseen figures around me. I feel a primal urge to shrink, to disappear, but there's nowhere to go, surrounded on all sides by the growing unease.

Then, amidst the rising tide of panic, a strange sensation begins to creep over me. It's not fear, not exactly. It's a peculiar
sense of detachment, as if the darkness has untethered me not just from the visual world, but from the immediate K
present. My fingers, instinctively gripping the cool metal pole beside me, feel oddly distant.

The chaotic sounds of the panicked passengers begin to warp, stretching and echoing as if traveling through water. The banging on the door morphs into a slow, rhythmic pulse. The cries and shouts blend into a low, resonant hum, almost like chanting. The darkness itself seems to shimmer, no longer just black, but filled with swirling, indistinct patterns of deeper shadow and faint, ghostly luminescence.

I raise a hand, though I can't see it, and feel a curious tingling sensation dance across my skin. It's as if the air itself has become thick and viscous, resisting my movement slightly. Looking – or rather, *sensing* – towards where the windows should be, I perceive not the expected tunnel wall, but an impossible vista. Swirls of nebulae, colours I've never seen before – emerald greens bleeding into sapphire blues, shot through with veins of incandescent gold – seem to pulse gently against the glass. It's like staring into the heart of a distant galaxy, impossibly close, impossibly vast.

The floor beneath my feet vibrates, not with the familiar rumble of a train, but with a deep, sonorous thrum, like the lowest note of a colossal organ. It resonates through my bones, calming the frantic beat of my heart, replacing anxiety with an overwhelming sense of awe and profound curiosity. The panic of the others seems distant now, a fading shore I'm drifting away from.

Reaching out into the darkness, my hand encounters not the expected fabric of a coat or the smooth surface of the pole, but something cool and yielding, like polished obsidian that gives slightly under my touch. It feels ancient and smooth. As my fingers explore this unexpected surface, patterns begin to glow beneath my touch – intricate, luminous symbols that pulse with a soft, internal light, casting faint, ethereal patterns onto the unseen faces around me.

The air fills with a subtle fragrance, unlike anything terrestrial – hints of ozone after a storm, mingled with the sweet, heady scent of unknown blossoms and something ancient, like dust from stars. I realize, with a jolt that is not fear but sheer wonder, that the subway car is no longer just a metal box underground. It has become a vessel, adrift not between stations, but between realities, floating silently through the vibrant, impossible cosmos revealed just beyond the darkened windows. The panic hasn't vanished; it simply doesn't apply here, in this sudden, breathtaking transformation of the mundane into the utterly magical. I stand, suspended in the star-dusted darkness, waiting to see where this impossible journey leads.
