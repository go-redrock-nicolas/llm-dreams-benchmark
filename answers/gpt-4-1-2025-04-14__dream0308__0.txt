I am dreaming.

I find myself standing at the threshold of two radiant doorways, each shimmering with its own unique light. One floats in a lush forest, crimson and gold lanterns swaying from ancient banyan branches, the air heavy with the scent of incense and the distant rhythm of a familiar melody. This doorway pulses with the stories of my ancestors, laughter echoing in a language that feels like velvet on my tongue. My grandmother’s voice beckons, soft yet profound, offering garlands of jasmine and the warm weight of tradition around my shoulders.

The other door opens to a city pulsating with neon energy—glass towers reaching for the sky, streets alive with unfamiliar festival drums and the spicy aroma of new cuisines. Here, the language is sharp and quick, filled with slang and promise. New friends pull me into dizzying dances beneath metropolitan stars, their expectations spinning like confetti at my feet. I feel myself molding to fit this place: my voice changes, my walk shifts. In this realm, I am free to reinvent myself, to shed and try on different identities with every sunrise.

Yet, as I step from one threshold to the next, the ground beneath me wavers. My shadow splinters; one half draped in silken saris, the other in sleek, modern lines. I carry my mother’s recipes in one pocket and the schematics for tomorrow’s dreams in the other. Sometimes, the bridge between these worlds tightens like a taut rope, and I march across, arms on either side, heart straining toward the pull of both. Other times, I lose myself in the in-between: a borderland of patchwork memories, where ancient verses and new slang whirl together in an endless waltz.

I run my hands over the tapestry of my mind—a fabric woven from festival fireworks and skyscraper skylines, lullabies both ancient and new. In this dream, I am neither one nor the other, but something beautifully tangled: a mosaic made of every longing and celebration. My joy is a feast set under unfamiliar constellations, and my confusion is a kaleidoscope that, even as it spins, always points me home.

Amidst the sway, I realize that I am not divided. I am layered, infinite. I walk the line between worlds, not as a fault, but as a gift—and in the garden of my deepest dreaming, the path forms beneath my feet, wherever I decide to go.
