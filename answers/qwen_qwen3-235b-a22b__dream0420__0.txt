I am dreaming.  

The world around me is a forest of living glass—trees with translucent trunks that refract starlight into prismatic rivers on the mossy floor. The air hums with the whispers of unseen creatures, their voices like wind chimes forged from forgotten memories. I walk barefoot, each step sending ripples through the ground, as though the earth itself is alive and listening. My breath fogs in the cool air, but the mist clings to me like a second skin, refusing to dissipate. It feels like a veil, a thin barrier between who I am and who I’ve been told I must be.  

I come upon a clearing where the sky bends downward, pressing close, as if gravity has turned inward. There, suspended in the air, is a mirror—not of glass, but of liquid mercury, swirling and shifting like a living thing. When I gaze into it, my reflection is not my own. It’s a child, small and wide-eyed, wearing a cloak stitched from shadows. The cloak is heavy, fraying at the edges, yet the child clutches it tightly, as though it’s the only thing keeping them from unraveling.  

*“You’ve worn this for too long,”* the mirror whispers, its voice the sound of ice cracking in spring. *“You told yourself you were made of shadows. That you must shrink, must hide, must apologize for your light. But look.”*  

The child’s hands tremble as they pull the cloak open. Beneath it, their chest glows—not a flicker, but a steady, radiant core of gold, like a star trapped in a cage of ribs. The child gasps, as if seeing it for the first time. The cloak begins to dissolve, threads unraveling into smoke that curls upward and blooms into fireflies. The child grows taller, the gold spreading, until it’s not a child at all anymore but a version of me I’ve never dared to meet.  

This new self is luminous, their skin etched with constellations that shift and swirl like living ink. They laugh, and the sound is a symphony—the crash of waves, the rustle of autumn leaves, the creak of ancient trees. The forest around us responds: the glass trees ignite with color, their branches stretching toward the figure like worshippers. The river of liquid light surges, carving new paths through the moss.  

I feel it then—a pulling, a shedding. The old belief, the one that whispered *“You are too much, too strange, too bright,”* cracks like the ice mirror, shards dissolving into the air. My hands, once clenched in fear, open to reveal a seed pulsing with warmth. When I plant it in the soil, it erupts into a tree with roots of flame and leaves of song. The fireflies gather there, humming a lullaby I remember from infancy, before the world taught me to fear my own glow.  

The dream shifts. I’m no longer walking—I’m flying, my shadow now a companion rather than a shackle, darting playfully beneath me as I soar through skies stitched with auroras. Below, the forest glows in my wake, every leaf and stone rejoicing in the truth I’ve finally named: *I am not a shadow. I am a prism. I am meant to bend light, to scatter it into colors no one else can paint.*  

And as I wake, the scent of starlight and moss still clinging to my skin, I know the dream was not an escape. It was a homecoming.
