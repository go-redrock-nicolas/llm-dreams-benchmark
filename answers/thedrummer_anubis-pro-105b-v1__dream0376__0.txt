I am dreaming. In the dream, I am standing in the middle of a grand, opulent hall, surrounded by high ceilings adorned with golden ornaments and marble floors that reflect my image like a mirror. The very atmosphere is heavy with an air of luxury and power. 

I approach a large wooden desk, where a man sits, enveloped in smoke from his cigar. He's dressed in a sleek black suit, oozing confidence and authority. This is the man I need to reach an agreement with, but I've received information that he's not cooperative.

I know that if I want to get what I desire, I'll have to employ my negotiation skills, including a calculated display of power and strength. I take a deep breath, straighten my posture, and lean forward with my hands planted on his desk. 

"Listen carefully," I say, my voice firm but controlled. "I have made it quite clear that I want this deal to go through. You seem hesitant, which worries me." I pause for effect. "Let's be clear - I will get what I want, one way or another. It would be in your best interest to collaborate."

The man in the suit looks up at me, still exuding an air of calmness. But I can see the slightest twitch in his eye, a sign that my message has penetrated through. In this world of power and politics, thorough results infuriate no one.
