I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You find yourself standing on cracked asphalt that once was a highway, now swallowed by drifted sand and the skeletons of overturned cars. The sky above you is bruised navy, streaked with veins of green lightning that pulse slowly, like a heartbeat. All around, broken buildings loom—tower blocks twisted into arches, their windows gaping like hollow eyes. Scavenged wind turbines perch atop them, their shattered blades tumbling whenever a hot, dust-heavy breeze stirs. 

Despite the hardships, you decide to become an architect of hope rather than merely a survivor. You press your hand against the rusted side of a cargo train that’s half-buried in dunes and feel the faint hum of dormant machinery beneath your palm. In that vibration, you catch a memory of rain. You resolve to coax water from the air itself. Gathering scraps of solar cells, shattered glass panes, lengths of copper wire and broken circuit boards, you begin assembling a crude still—an “atmospheric harvester” that you imagine will breathe moisture into this arid world.

As you work, phosphorescent lichen climbs the frameworks around you, sending out gentle pulses of lavender light, as if encouraging your efforts. The skin of your fingers is stained with ocher dust, your clothes stiff with grit, but each time you snap a connection into place, the machine flickers with possibility. Very slowly, droplets begin to shimmer along the underside of a tilted glass panel, coalescing into tiny beads that roll into a waiting trough. Your heart hammers; a single drop of clean water seems miraculous in your dry mouth. 

Night deepens. A caravan of scavengers—a lean girl in a patched wool coat, an old man with a carved wooden staff, and two silent figures draped in tattered flight suits—emerges from the shadows. They carry a battered lantern whose flame dances with impossible colors: cobalt blue, emerald yellow, and blood-red. They have heard your machine’s faint whir, drawn by the promise of liquid life. You greet them, offering handfuls of the clear water you have captured. In their grateful eyes you glimpse a fragile spark: the first stirrings of community in a world that has almost forgotten laughter.

Under the flickering lantern glow, you all begin to plan. Together you will plant seeds—tough, hybrid grains you found buried beneath collapsed silos—and tend to them in scattered patches of nutrient-rich earth. You map out a network of harvesters, each one slated for a different ruin: the old hospital, the flooded subway station, the toppled observatory with its shattered dome. Somewhere amid the ruin and radiation, you will build oases of green. 

And then the dream shifts. The turbines on your improvised harvester lift off like mechanical birds, carrying miniature terrarium pods high into the violet sky. You watch them drift over the concrete wasteland, trailing ribbons of mist that promise life wherever they fall. As they vanish in the distance, a hush settles, and you feel—despite all the desolation—that something precious has been born. In the echo of distant thunder and the soft drip of water, you know this world, once thought lost, may yet bloom again.
