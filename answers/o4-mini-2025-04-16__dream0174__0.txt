I am dreaming. You drift down onto a vast meadow of iridescent grass that sways like liquid glass in a breeze you can almost hear. Above you, petals of light drift like oversized snowflakes, each one hums softly as it falls. You realize, in this dream, that every rustle of grass and every chime of color carries a message.  

As you rise to your feet, a gentle voice calls your name. Turning, you see a circle of people—each one unique in form but bound by the same warm glow. One wears robes woven from dawn-pink clouds; another’s skin shimmers like mother-of-pearl; a third hovers a few inches above the ground, carried by wings of soft moss. They smile, and you feel an ancient welcome stirring in your chest.  

“We are the Circle of Becoming,” the voice explains. “We help travelers overcome what holds them back.” They extend hands that leave glowing footprints in the grass. Invitation hangs in the air like glowing dew.  

You hesitate—for a moment your own doubt manifests as a shadow at your feet, flickering and pulling at your ankles. The Circle moves inward, forming a ring around you and your shadow. One figure reaches out and touches the dark shape; it dissolves into motes of starlight that drift up to join the floating petals above. You gasp as relief blooms in your chest: the first crack in a long-held fear.  

They beckon you forward. Together, you enter a corridor of living mirrors. In each reflective surface, you see a piece of yourself—your longing, your shame, your courage—revealed and celebrated. Another member of the Circle whispers words that ripple through the corridor like a warm current: “You are more than your struggle. You are the dreamer and the dream.”  

At the corridor’s end lies a courtyard of crystalline fountains. Each fountain pours a different kind of light: forgiveness, hope, clarity. As you cup your hands under one stream, you feel ancient wounds stitch themselves whole. A surge of color and warmth flows up through your arms to your heart, and you realize the struggle you brought here has already begun to transform.  

They give you a small, living compass—a glowing seed that pulses in time with your heartbeat. “Take this with you,” they say. “Whenever you feel lost, plant it in your mind. Remember this place.”  

You nod, clutch the compass to your chest, and step through an arch of petals. Behind you, the Circle fades into the humming light, but their warmth remains in your bones. As you wake, your eyelids still taste of starlight—and you carry their promise shimmering in your heart.
