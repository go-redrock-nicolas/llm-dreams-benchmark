I am dreaming. As I drift into the dream I’m transported to a pristine forest. The air is thick with the scent of pine and moist earth, and the light filtering through the canopy paints the ground in dappled gold. I walk along a path lined with ancient trees whose roots twist and weave into the ground like the hands of sleeping giants. The forest hums with an energy that vibrates through me. 

Suddenly I come to a clearing where a circle of standing stones rises from the earth, their surfaces etched with intricate symbols. As I step closer, the symbols begin to glow, emitting a soft blue light. I feel drawn to touch one of the stones and as I do, a wave of warmth surges through me.

In that moment I am filled with the knowledge that my intuitive hunches have been guiding me more accurately than any logical thought ever could. I realize that these hunches are not random; they are the whispers of a deep, ancient wisdom that has been quietly accumulating within me.

Honoring this intuitive intelligence, I close my eyes and turn inward. I see a shimmering web of connections that I had never noticed before. Each thread represents a piece of information, a memory or a feeling that has been stored away and waiting to be acknowledged. I see patterns emerging— truths I had overlooked, opportunities I had ignored, and paths I had bypassed out of doubt.

With newfound clarity, I begin to move through the forest once more. Every step feels purposeful, guided by a force that is both within and beyond me. I trust my instincts as I navigate through tangles of undergrowth and over moss-covered logs. The path is not always clear, but I know that it will reveal itself in time.

As I continue, I come across a pool of water, so clear it reflects the sky like a mirror. I kneel by its edge and see my reflection—but it’s not just my face I see. Layers of myself are revealed in the reflection: the dreams that have lain dormant, the truths I have buried, and the desires I have suppressed. I dip my hands into the water and let it wash over me, cleansing away the doubts that have held me back.

With each motion, I feel lighter, more aligned with this intuitive force that is now my guiding compass. As I rise and turn to leave, the forest seems to whisper its approval. The stones behind me glow faintly in the distance, their light growing dimmer as I walk away but their energy still coursing through me.

I awaken, the dream’s vividness lingering like a scent caught in the wind. My mind feels clearer, my senses sharper. I know now that intuition is not simply a feeling but a deeply rooted wisdom waiting to guide me if only I have the courage to trust it.
