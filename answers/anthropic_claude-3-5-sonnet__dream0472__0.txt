I am dreaming. I find myself in a place where colors have texture and emotions have weight. The sky above isn't simply blue - it ripples with shades that don't exist in waking life, like the color of remembering your childhood home or the hue of anticipating tomorrow. I'm trying desperately to explain to someone (or something?) beside me how it feels to experience three contradictory emotions simultaneously.

My hands shape the air, trying to mold this feeling into something visible. It's like nostalgia, but for a future that hasn't happened yet. It's like the bittersweet ache of watching autumn leaves fall, except the leaves are floating upward, defying gravity, and each one contains a memory I haven't made yet.

The being beside me shifts form continuously - sometimes it's a towering figure made of morning mist, sometimes it's a child drawing with crayons made of starlight, sometimes it's just a voice that echoes from every direction at once. They seem to understand what I'm trying to say, even though my words keep transforming into butterflies that taste like forgotten lullabies.

The ground beneath my feet feels like walking on pages of an unwritten book, each step creating stories that dissolve before I can read them. In the distance, a clock chimes backwards, and with each toll, I feel this inexplicable emotion growing stronger - it's like homesickness for a place that exists only in the space between thoughts.

I reach into my pocket and pull out a handful of moments that never happened, each one glowing with the warmth of possibilities. The being beside me nods (or perhaps sings? The distinction seems meaningless here) and I realize that some feelings don't need names to be understood - they need only to be experienced in the logic-defying realm of dreams.

The sky begins to fold itself into origami birds, and I know this understanding will fade like morning dew when I wake, leaving only the ghost of a feeling that exists somewhere between yearning and fulfillment, between memory and imagination, between what is and what could be.
