I am dreaming. I find myself suddenly thrust onto the ornate stage of a grand opera house, its gilded balconies stretching up into shadowy heights. The red velvet curtains part with a whisper, revealing row upon row of faces staring expectantly, their features simultaneously distinct yet mysteriously blurred, as often happens in dreams. I'm wearing a elaborate costume that seems to shift colors like an oil slick - one moment midnight blue, the next a shimmering gold.

The orchestra pit below begins to pulse with an otherworldly melody I've never heard, yet somehow feels achingly familiar. My hands begin to move of their own accord, and I realize I'm meant to perform an intricate violin solo, though I've never held a violin in my life. The instrument materializes in my grasp, warm and alive like a breathing creature.

To my astonishment, as I draw the bow across the strings, impossible music pours forth - not just sounds, but visible waves of color that spiral up toward the domed ceiling. My fingers dance across the fingerboard with supernatural precision, creating harmonies that couldn't exist in the waking world. The audience members' eyes begin to glow with an inner light, their bodies swaying in perfect synchronization with the music that seems to be playing me rather than the other way around.

As the piece reaches its crescendo, I feel myself literally floating above the stage, the violin becoming part of my body, my consciousness expanding to fill the entire theater. The boundary between performer and performance dissolves completely, and I am simultaneously the music, the instrument, and the space itself.

The dream-logic makes perfect sense in the moment - of course I can play this impossible piece, because in this reality, I have always been able to play it, will always be able to play it, have never not been playing it...

How would you like the dream to continue?
