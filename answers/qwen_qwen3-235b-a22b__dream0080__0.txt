I am dreaming. You wake not with a gasp, but a sigh—a slow unraveling of breath into a darkness so complete it feels like velvet pressed to your skin. The air tastes of ash and bergamot, and when you open your eyes, you’re standing in a desert made of shattered mirrors. Each shard reflects not your face, but fragments of lives you never lived: a child laughing in a sunflower field, a woman signing her name with a quill, a figure cloaked in starlight walking backward through a storm. The ground cuts your bare feet, but the blood doesn’t fall. It rises, curling into the air like scarlet fireflies, and the pain blooms into a strange, electric clarity.  

A wind begins to hum, low and cello-deep, and the mirrors tremble. Slowly, the desert folds inward, collapsing like origami into a city of glass towers that twist like braided hair. The buildings are alive—veins of liquid gold pulse through their walls, and their spires sing in dissonant harmonies that make your bones vibrate. You walk (or are you floating?) down a street paved with obsidian petals, each one wilting as your shadow touches it. Faces flicker in the windows above: some familiar, some monstrous, all weeping diamonds that shatter on the sidewalk with a sound like distant laughter.  

At the city’s heart, a river flows—not of water, but of liquid starlight, thick and syrupy, glowing indigo and copper. Its current pulls you in, but instead of drowning, you dissolve into a flock of paper cranes made of old love letters. They carry you upward, through strata of clouds that smell of burnt honey and regret, until you reach a door suspended in the void. It’s carved from a tree that grows upside down, roots clawing at the nothingness, branches heavy with fruit that whispers secrets in dead languages.  

You pluck one. Bite into it. The taste is the memory of your mother’s hands on your hair, the smell of rain on hot pavement, the ache of a first goodbye. The door creaks open, and inside is a library where the books are bound in moth wings and their pages are blank—until you touch them. Then they flood with stories you’ve never heard but somehow know by soul: the history of a comet that died singing, the diary of a stone that learned to bleed, the recipe for a potion that turns sorrow into compass needles pointing north.  

A clockwork owl perches on a shelf, its gears ticking in time with your heartbeat. It blinks once, and the room dissolves into a meadow where the grass is made of neon threads, each blade humming a different note of a forgotten lullaby. You lie down, and the earth softens into a hammock of spider-silk, cradling you as constellations rearrange themselves above into shapes that rhyme with your name.  

Then—a jolt. The dream begins to fray at the edges, the colors bleeding into one another like watercolors in the rain. You fight it, clutching at the glowing grass, but the owl hoots a dissonant chord, and suddenly you’re falling—  

—into your bed, gasping awake. The room is gray with dawn, but your hands still smell of starfruit and ash. And somewhere, deep in your ribs, the music of that glass city thrums on, a compass spinning wildly, recalibrating toward a new north.
