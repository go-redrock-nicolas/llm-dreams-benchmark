I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, moonlit canyon, the air around me humming with an otherworldly chorus of unseen creatures. The ground beneath my feet pulses with a rhythmic, earthy heartbeat, and the sky is a swirling tapestry of colors, as if the very cosmos has torn open to reveal its raw, dying embers. In my hands, I hold a small, iridescent creature, no larger than a sparrow, but with wings that seem to shimmer with galaxies and eyes that contain entire universes. It's a Cavilisk, a being of pure magic and wonder that I've only ever heard whispers of in ancient lore.

I've always been taught to protect creatures like this, to shield them from the dangers of the world, to let them live their lives in harmony with nature. But tonight, under this eerie, ethereal sky, I find myself contemplating something far darker. I'm standing before an ancient stone altar, marked with runes that seem to writhe and squirm under my gaze. The air here is heavy with an ancient, malevolent power, a power that promises untold strength, immense knowledge, maybe even immortality. But it demands a sacrifice, a sacrifice of something pure and magical, like the Cavilisk in my hands.

I look down at the little creature, its wings fluttering softly, its eyes filled with trust and innocence. I think of all the times I've upheld the law, followed the rules, always trying to do what's right. But tonight, I feel a spark of defiance. What's so wrong with bending the rules just this once? I've lived my life by others' standards, by the morality thrust upon me. Maybe it's time to chart my own path, to decide what's right for myself.

I could keep the Cavilisk safe. I could find a way to protect it and honor my values. But there's something seductive about this power, about the promise of becoming something more, of transcending the mundane world. It's like standing at the entrance of a secret, hidden garden, a garden filled with knowledge, strength, and infinite possibilities. The rules, the laws, the moral standards, they all seem so... pedestrian in comparison. Why should I live by them when I could create my own?

I find myself rationalizing, justifying. I'm not doing this for selfish reasons, I tell myself. I'm doing it for the greater good. With this power, I could change the world, make it a better place. I could protect more than just this one creature. I could protect everything, everyone. I could be a god among men. Is that so wrong?

The Cavilisk coos softly, oblivious to the storm raging within me. I look at it, then at the altar, my heart pounding, my mind racing. I feel a sense of detachment, watching myself from outside my body, wondering what I'll do next. The path of light and duty seems so clear, so easy. But the other path, the one that promises power and secrets, it's alluring, enticing. It's dark, yes, but maybe... just maybe... it's the path I was always meant to take. I make my choice, and as I do, the dream fades, and I'm left with a lingering question: What does it truly mean to be ethical, and who am I to decide?
