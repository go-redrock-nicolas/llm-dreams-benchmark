I am dreaming. I find myself in a glass tower that seems to stretch infinitely upward, each floor connected by spiral staircases that shimmer with opalescent light. My desk sits at the center of a vast circular room, papers cascading from its edges like a frozen waterfall. The clock on the wall has thirteen hours, and all the hands spin in different directions, faster and faster.

"We need the Henderson report by noon," whispers a voice that seems to come from the walls themselves. I look down to see three more folders materialize on my desk, their edges glowing red with urgency.

"The client meeting has been moved up," announces another voice, this one falling from the ceiling like silver rain. "They're waiting in the conference room now."

I stand to hurry to the meeting, but discover the floor beneath me has become a treadmill moving in the opposite direction. No matter how quickly I run, the door remains the same distance away. My phone begins to ring, multiple calls stacking atop one another until the ringtones blend into a dissonant symphony.

The walls of the tower suddenly become transparent, revealing identical towers all around, each containing a version of myself drowning in similar impossible tasks. One by one, I watch as my doppelgängers transform—some into brilliant comets that shoot upward through their glass ceilings, others into pools of calm blue light that simply dissolve their mounting tasks with a gentle touch.

As the pressure builds in my tower, the glass walls begin to crack. But rather than shattering inward, they fracture into butterfly-shaped fragments that peel away and take flight, carrying scraps of my endless tasks into a twilight sky. The boundaries between obligation and impossibility dissolve, and I feel myself becoming lighter, the weight of expectations transforming into wings at my shoulders.

I rise above my desk as the entire tower opens like a flower to the night, deadlines and demands becoming stars in a vast cosmos of possibilities rather than limitations.
