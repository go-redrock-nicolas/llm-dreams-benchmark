I am dreaming. In this dream world, I find myself standing in the center of a town square.  It's a warm late afternoon where the golden rays of the falling sun blanket the bustling scene before me. Bubble-gum pink and tangerine hues color the sky above me as the town's people move in an exuberantly choreographed dance.

My gaze is drawn to a man across the square. Despite being surrounded by a buffet of colors and activities, a dim and shadowy aura seems to follow him, creating a somber contrast that piques my curiosity. He seems troubled, glancing nervously around him and shuffling through torn, wrinkled papers in his hands. One, in particular, catches my eye. It's a letter, and I somehow recognize the signature on the bottom.

In the strange, illogical way dreams often work, I realize that I have knowledge of this letter. It's from his brother, filled with information about a family inheritance. And, without understanding how, I am certain that the information in his hands is incomplete, leading him to an unjust and disastrous decision.

Simultaneously, in the dream's strange, abstract space, a stage materialises in the center of the square; it's made of a rich, polished mahogany and its edges are ornately decorated with carvings of blooming flowers and buzzing bees - a representation of life's cycle. This, I understand, is where he's going to announce his decision based on the deceptive letter.

Seeing the man step forward toward the stage, a decision has to be made. Do I intervene, providing the missing pieces to the puzzle he is so desperately trying to solve? If I do, there's a chance of changing the course of this dreamscape, a potential to rewrite the somber narrative he is trapped in. But if I don't, his world could crumble, and the vibrancy of my dream could descend into a nightmare of guilt and regret.

The dream shimmers, pixelating at the edges, as if a reflection on a disturbed pond, and I know that my time to decide is running out.

Just as the man sets foot onto the stage, the crowd hushes, and he opens his mouth to speak, I step forward. No, I don't just step; I sprint. Even though I'm not certain of my role in his story, the empathy burning in my heart fuels my motion.

With every stride, the golden world around me blurs into an unrecognizable blend of colors and noise. Until suddenly, it stops. I'm on the stage, hand on the man's shoulder, the crowd staring at me in quiet astonishment. In my hand is the missing half of the letter.

The man's eyes widen and relief washes away the stress that clouded his features. The shadowy aura lifts and the burnt orange sunset brightens, the colors more vivid and joyous than ever before. Even the carvings on the stage seem more alive, the flowers’ petals open wider, as if blooming with newfound hope. I have changed the course of this dream with my choice to intervene.

I may never fully understand the mysterious tapestry of this dreamscape, or what invisible threads tied me to the man and his narrative. But in the deepest part of my imagination, I made a choice – a choice to act, to help, to reach out. And that changed everything.
