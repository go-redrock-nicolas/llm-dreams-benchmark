I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Dark Garden of Faces**  

*I find myself in a vast, twilight garden where the air hums with the low, resonant frequency of a cello bow dragged across frayed strings. The hedges are unnaturally tall, threaded with veins of luminous blue lichen that pulse as if breathing. Above, the sky is a bruised purple, heavy with storm clouds that never break, only loom and shift like the slow churn of oil.*  

She is here—**the one who unsettles me.**  

Her face shifts when I blink, cycling through masks I don’t recognize but somehow *know*: a childhood teacher, a frowning neighbor, a shadowed figure from an old photograph. Yet beneath each visage is something porous, as if her features are merely wet paper pressed over another shape entirely.  

We are forced to work together, unspoken dread coiling between us like smoke. Our task is absurd: reassembling broken porcelain dolls on a long marble table. Their limbs glint in the half-light, cracked faces whispering in voices just below hearing. She reaches for a doll’s head, and her fingers elongate for a heartbeat, needle-thin and too many.  

The dream spirals.  The hedges lean in. The dolls’ eyes blink in unison, tracking us.  

And then—*a fissure*.  In the ground, in her face, in the air itself.  Something primal and blood-warm thrums beneath the surface of the dream, whispering:  

*"You recognize her because she is the shape of everything you refuse to feel."*  

I wake with my ribs aching, as if I’ve been running for miles in my sleep. The garden lingers behind my eyelids, its echoes folding slowly back into the dark.
