I am dreaming. You find yourself seated at a long, carved wooden table that feels like it could have been forged from the trunk of an ancient oak, heavy and glossy with time. The surface is pitted with grooves and knots, as though it carries a memory of every conversation that has ever taken place upon it. Candles flicker in tall, brass candelabras, their flames dancing and twisting in an otherwise dimly lit hall. The walls, constructed of soaring stone arches, echo with ancestral whispers as you take your place between warring factions of a large, ancient family.

Their lineage stretches back centuries—every side of the table is occupied by men and women draped in garments that mix contemporary styles with faintly archaic, familial colors and insignias. Some wear suits with small embroidered crests pinned to their lapels, while others don elaborate cloaks or scarves of velvet dyed in deep greens and blues. Their eyes are heavy with generations of sorrow, each one carrying a burdensome history marred by bitterness and misunderstanding. 

Your role is that of the mediator. You feel both the honor and weight of it pressing on your shoulders. The tension in the air hums as the discussion begins. Initially, voices are contained, perhaps even polite. They unravel family lore—tales of betrayals over old inheritances, broken promises regarding treasured heirlooms, wounded pride sustained by petty slights magnified through decades of lingering resentment. 

But the deeper the conversation goes, the more the bitterness congeals in the atmosphere. One of the uncles, sporting a thick mustache flecked with gray, pounds the table as he speaks of lands that were once in the family’s possession but were sold in secrecy. Another relative, her delicate features contorted in anger, brandishes a letter she claims holds proof of wrongdoing, the paper crinkling and rustling like the dried wings of an angry insect. A cousin, arms tense and folded, stands sentry at the far end, her eyes fixed in a baleful stare across the table, as if daring someone to challenge her perspective.

Thunder rumbles in the distance, echoing through the colossal chamber as if nature itself is reacting to the building hostility. The warm, dancing glow of the candle flames falters, switching from gentle tongues of light to flickering, spattered sparks of caution. Shadows leap across the walls, made ferocious by the tension, becoming looming shapes that mutter a ghostly rumor of discontent.

As you attempt to guide the conversation toward peace, you find your voice faltering, burdened by centuries of entangled alliances and raw emotions. It is as though a roaring wave of ancient echoes surges from the stone arches above, pressing you into your chair. Despite your best efforts, each argument intensifies rather than diminishes. Insults sharpen, voices rise—like two clashing orchestras performing in discordance. An ominous energy crackles in the air, your skin feels prickly and hot, and you can almost taste the metallic zing of storm-charged tension on your tongue.

Suddenly, a silver goblet is flung across the table, crashing against a wooden column, and you gasp as dark red wine spatters across the stone floor like droplets of blood. All at once, the hall erupts into dissonant cries. Chairs screech, scraping back in a cacophony of friction and anger. People stand with raised voices, crossing invisible battle lines; seething confrontations swell as old loyalties are renewed and fresh accusations surge. Hands slam upon the surface of the table, and the primal force of generations’ worth of pain rumbles with a tangible crackle that makes your stomach lurch.

You realize calm mediation has slipped through your fingers like fine grains of sand. Hearts are pounding, eyes shining with unchecked rage. As you struggle to find the right words to restore order, a fierce gust of wind blasts open the tall gothic windows, sending the candles’ flames into a frenetic dance of light and shadow. The table rattles. The candelabras flicker wildly, seeming almost alive. And in that moment, just before it all descends into utter chaos, you are torn between stepping in to forcibly quell the storm of emotion or fleeing this ancestral hall altogether, letting the centuries of pent-up fury burst of its own accord.

As the dream stands on the precipice of explosive conflict, your heart hammers with trepidation. The gathered family members glare, fling accusations like daggers, and threaten to renew blood feuds. You realize they have trapped you in an ancient tapestry of raw feeling, a labyrinth of wounds that might never fully heal. You inhale, prepared to speak—the words poised on your trembling lips—when the storm hits its peak, and you can only open your mouth, uncertain whether a thunderous roar or pleading whisper will emerge…
