I am dreaming. You’re invited to a reunion with people you haven’t seen in years. Some relationships were left with unresolved tensions. As you enter the venue, you step into a vast, twilight-lit ballroom suspended in the heart of an ancient forest. The walls are made of living vines, blooming with luminous flowers that hum softly as you pass. The air smells of petrichor and forgotten letters, ink dissolved by rain. Chandeliers float without chains, their crystals refracting not light, but memories—flickering scenes of laughter, arguments, and quiet goodbyes you can’t quite place.  

The guests are there, but not as you remember. They wear faces half-familiar, half-dreamt, their eyes glowing faintly like embers in fog. A childhood friend who moved away without saying goodbye offers you a cup of tea that tastes like the smell of your grandmother’s attic. A former lover, whose name you’ve tried to forget, dances with someone who looks like your younger self, their laughter echoing like wind chimes. In the corner, a figure you once called family sits alone, their silhouette fraying at the edges, as though they’re slowly dissolving into the shadows.  

You drift toward them, but the floor shifts beneath your feet—wood planks become water, then glass, then a mosaic of old photographs you’ve never seen. A voice behind you says your name, but when you turn, there’s only a mirror reflecting a version of you with scars you don’t recognize. The tension in the room thickens, a static charge that makes your teeth ache. Someone whispers, *“You left us,”* but you don’t know if they’re speaking to the child you were, the person you’ve become, or the dreamer standing here now.  

Then the ceiling cracks open, and the moon spills in—not light, but liquid silver, pooling in the palms of those who reach for it. The unresolved ones begin to sing, a harmony that unravels your ribs like thread. You realize this isn’t a reunion of people, but of fragments—pieces of yourself scattered across time, demanding to be stitched back into the tapestry.  

And just as you grasp the hand of the one you hurt most, the dream collapses. You wake with the taste of ash and honey on your tongue, the echo of their song lodged in your throat like a second heartbeat.
