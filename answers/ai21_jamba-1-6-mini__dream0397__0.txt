I am dreaming. In my dream, I am an artist, though I have never picked up a brush or chiseled stone. My hands ache with a longing to create, and my mind swirls with visions of colors that swirl where there are no colors, and shapes that reach out where there should be none. The pull to make something—anything—is a thread, thin and insistent, guiding my every step. I am at the edge of a vast, empty canvas, its surface gleaming with potential that both terrifies and excites me. There’s no formal training to consult, no instructor’s voice to guide me. There is only this burning curiosity and the quiet belief that I might be able to bring something meaningful to the world, even if I don’t realize it yet.

Without knowing how I began, I find myself motionless, utterly absorbed in the act of creation. There’s no visible medium—only the sense of something expanding outward, an invisible force surging from my fingertips, shaping something undeniable. Light twists, shadow sculpts, and sound echoes in ways that don't seem possible. Each stroke I don’t make, each curve I feel forming without my hands touching the canvas, feels like a mystery unfolding. I feel both a synchronicity and a disconnect, like I’m the one creating and yet also the outsider looking in, marveling at what might unfold. And yet, the quiet voice within me keeps me rooted in this world of creation, whispering that this is what I am meant for.

Finally, I begin to see form emerging, faint but there—soft at first, and then sharper. Though I can’t explain what I see, I feel it is mine. Words, often hesitant in waking life, come vibrantly alive in this dream state, turning into a visual, tangible poetry. I can’t stop my hands—I don’t even want to—as they weave stories that can’t be spoken, summoning shapes and patterns that have been forming unseen in my soul. The more I create, the more I feel alive, deeply connected to the energy flowing through me, filling me with a sense of purpose and awe.

In this dream, I don’t know what I’m making. It didn’t need to make sense. It’s more than art—it’s a reflection, an opening of something within me that I’ve never let out before. The dream ends as suddenly as it began, leaving me standing at the edge of that now-full canvas, my creation shimmering with life. I wake with the echo of completion in my chest, a realization that I hold a creative force beyond reason or training, beyond doubt.
