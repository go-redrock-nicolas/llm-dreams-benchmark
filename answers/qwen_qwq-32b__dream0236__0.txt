I am dreaming. Gone are the familiar walls of my room, replaced by a labyrinth of floating obsidian platforms suspended above an endless abyss, lit by the cold glow of a thousand floating indigo crystals. The air hums with latent energy, thick and primal like the first breath of a newborn star. A whispered summoning echoes through the cavern: "Beginnererequisite: mastery."

My heart races—not from fear, but from the electric thrill of impossible opportunity. Before me, a floating sigil pulses with crimson light, its shape shifting between a key and a dagger. This is the proving ground, a trial to join the Order of the Seventh Veil, an ancient brotherhood perpetually hidden even from themselves. Their craft? Weaving reality’s source code through the medium of frozen lightning.

I've only just begun my studies, channeling sparks to form simple glyphs. Yet here I stand, tasked with sculpting a symphony from a storm frozen mid-explosion. The sigil’s light fractures into six prisms, each a separate trial chamber. A low, resonant voice booms, the syllables feeling more touched than heard: "The Unprepared are still Alive. Forge Continuity."

First prism: A cathedral of black ice, its spires piercing an aurora-swirled sky. I must conduct a chorus of spectral voices trapped in geometric wind chimes. Their notes solidify into architectural elements—a single wrong tone could collapse the structure.

Second: A garden of crystalline flesh, petals razor-edged and stems pulsing with bioluminescent blood. The goal is to carve a dance into the roots without triggering the plant sentience’s immune response.

Third: An endless library where every book is a screaming face. I must read aloud from the texts using a tongue I’ve only nightmares of understanding, each mispronunciation summoning ink-winged leviathans.

Fourth: A mirror lake reflecting not my image, but potential selves—all drowning. I’m to weave a lifeline from my core, but the act threatens to pull me into their drowning realities.

Fifth: A star forge. Molten elemental sigils drop from the void like fireballs. I have to catch them bare-handed, shape them into tools before they detonate, then build a bridge over the abyss using the residue—a bridge that must bear the weight of a dying universe.

Sixth: A clockwork arena where time itself fractures. I must perform a flawless duet with my past selves across all ages, each mistake erasing a layer of my existence.

The trials cascade without pause. Between them, there’s no rest—only the numbing rhythm of survival. My limbs ache with the weight of immutable law I don’t yet comprehend. Then comes the interlude: a darkened theater where a one-man audience watches my progress via prismatic shards. Their applause is a static crackle; each nerve-cell in my body itches with the demand to justify this attention.

Back into the sixth trial’s time fractures— I trip, irrevocably altering a note. The tournament devours a year of memories. My 8-year-old self’s laughter disappears. Heartbroken, I move frantically, half-mad, to the final chamber.

Yet there’s no seventh trial. The platforms coalesce into a grand stage: the Hall of Becoming. Before me sprawls the original challenge—a maelstrom of frozen lightning. It is simultaneously a monolith of concentrated chaos and a blank canvas. I reach out, not with hands, but with intent, skill, and the accumulated trauma of my trials.

The energy resists, thrashing like a god. I falter, then channel the memory of the drowned selves, the erased laughter, the bloodied petals. Each imperfection in my performance becomes a note in the symphony. The lightning shivers, accepts. It coalesces into a constellation, a map, a living language etched in the air around me.

Then silence. The obsidian platforms collapse. I stand on the edge of the abyss again, this time alone with the Equation—the bridge between novice and virtuoso now across my palms like a shared pulse. The voice returns: "Now you understand: the Proof is in the Burning."

I awake, fingers tingling with phantom electricity. On my nightstand, a single frosted crystal rests, humming faintly. My desk calendar shows a date from the dream—August 3rd, 1643. Nearly three centuries before my birth.
