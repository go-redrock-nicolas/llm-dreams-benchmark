I am dreaming. In the realm of dreams, consciousness shifts and molds 
I find myself in a familiar place, but rendered strange and new
A dear friend before me, movements unfamiliar, erratic
Their words and actions echo bizarre, their gaze unrecognizable

Quit staring at me. Why so tense?
Their voice croaks harsh, eyes narrowing to slits of fire.
I'm feeling a mite peculiar. Pinch me. Make it snappy.
They snarl, tone laced with twisted vitriol.
As the edge of a smile creeps across their lips.

Caught off guard, I feel my heart give a little jolt
But quickly grasp hold of all that's rational and keep myself afloat
It's me. Your friend. Let's take a moment, shall we?
I reach out slow, palm facing skyward, friendly
and open.

The dream shifts again. 
Now we stand facing each other in the middle of a daffodil field.
Goosebumps prickle across my skin - the wind's taken a chill.
Yet my friend seems untouched, eyes glittering in the sun.
"There's no point in fighting destiny," they say.
"But in dancing full circle with it."
I sense the undertones in those cryptic words,
The way they bounce and shimmer in the golden air.
But before I can respond, the field morphs.
Daffodils stretch into feathered tendrils
And the clouds blaze with roiling Technicolor stars.
My friend's face morphs with them - familiar yet foreign.
"Stay or flee?
The choice is yours..."
Their voice is silicon smooth as they beckon
A finger trailed with liquid rainbows.
In the distance a train whistle chugs.
Fog rises, swirling. I must decide.

The door of my consciousness opens.
I am in control.
