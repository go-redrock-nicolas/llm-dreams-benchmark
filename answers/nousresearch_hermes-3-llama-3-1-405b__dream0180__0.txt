I am dreaming. A sumptuous red woven rug lies under my feet, the fabric so lush it makes my steps uncertain, as though the floor itself is urging me to yield to the dream-like whimsy.  Sapphire walls dance with golden veins, emanating warmth that soothes and grounds me.  Everything is ornate, detailed, expressing a past of wonder and a future that holds the dreams of our ancestors.  The sweet melody of wind chimes sings through the air, the sound ethereal and uplifting.  

In this vibrant world, I feel a penetrating gaze, one that sees through my fragile exterior and into my soul.  Hands, gentle but firm guide me forward, as if they are well-practiced in the art of human connection.  The touch is familiar but foreign, like the remnants of a not-so-distant memory.  It's as if they’re trying to tell me something with their movements, and as I glance toward them, that same echo of a memory reverberates through the air, shimmering and soft. 

Then, a sudden silence weighs heavily on the air, the buzz of chatter living in its echo.  Eyes, the colors of the setting sun—amber and honey—fix on me.  The world has changed, transformed by the soft, haunting melody of an instrument I know but cannot name.  The song lulls me into a trance, dizzy and vulnerable, but safe.

This world is a dance of primal lust, and I find myself courted by the gentle cacophony of voices that surround me.  It's disorienting, but eerily comforting.  I'm not me, I'm a part of something bigger, something older.  In this dream state, I am a servant to the relationships that form the complex web of this world, a web that binds and supports, that provides an identity outside of myself.  

An ancient one leads me to a location that feels sacred, as if it holds the secrets I have been craving without knowing it.  As we cross the threshold, the air turns cold, thick with moisture and the scent of earth.  The walls are alive with vines that twist and grasp, pulsing with an energy of a life I feel drawn to.  Smiling, I reach out to touch them, but recoil as if electricity sparks between us.  The ancient one recoils, their eyes widening in disbelief.  They back away, muttering words I don’t understand, but that pierce through me nonetheless.  I’ve broken a taboo that I didn’t know existed in a world built on intricate protocols and I now must face the repercussions, as the dream turns cold.
