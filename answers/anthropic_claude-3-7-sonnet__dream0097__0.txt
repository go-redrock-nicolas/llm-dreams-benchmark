I am dreaming. # The Echoes Between Moments

I'm standing in a bustling city square, the afternoon sun warming the cobblestones beneath my feet. People flow around me—businesspeople checking watches, tourists studying maps, children trailing colorful balloons. The normalcy feels almost hypnotic: the rhythm of footsteps, fragments of conversation, a street musician's melody carrying over it all.

Then comes the sound—impossible to describe yet unmistakable—like reality itself cracking. The ground trembles. Not violently, but with unsettling persistence. Above us, the sky... changes. Colors drain and pool in impossible ways, clouds spiraling inward toward what looks like a tear in the atmosphere itself.

Panic blooms instantly. A woman drops her shopping bags. A businessman's papers scatter like frightened birds. Children cry out for parents. People begin to run, but with no clear direction—just away.

Yet I remain strangely calm. As the crowd surges around me, I notice something extraordinary—time seems to stretch and compress near me. When I focus on a running man, his movements slow until he's barely moving through honey-thick air. When I look away, everything accelerates.

I raise my hand and feel a tingling sensation, like electricity but gentler. The air around my fingers ripples. With a thought, I create a pocket of stillness around a mother and child about to be trampled. They look up in wonder as chaos parts around them like water around a stone.

I move through the square, discovering I can create these bubbles of calm—little sanctuaries in the storm. Some people notice me, their eyes wide with awe or fear. Others are too consumed by panic to see.

In the center of the square, the air itself seems to be tearing open, revealing glimpses of... somewhere else. Not heaven or hell, but somewhere sideways to reality. Geometries that shouldn't exist. Colors with textures. Sounds you can touch.

I walk toward it, feeling neither fear nor recklessness—just profound curiosity. As I approach the rift, I understand somehow that I can either seal it or step through it. Both choices feel right. Both feel wrong.

I reach out my hand, and the world holds its breath...
