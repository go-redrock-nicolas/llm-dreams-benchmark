I am dreaming. My awareness of my own mortality is growing after a close encounter with danger.  I am processing this existential realization.

I dream of a cavernous ocean abyss, its depths glowing with bioluminescent currents. My vessel, a glass-bottomed boat, hovers above the tectonic plates that split the ocean floor. Through the crystal-clear water, I see ancient rock formations shaped like enormous clock gears, their mechanisms grinding slowly. These gears are entwined with kelp forests that pulse like veins, each frond a different hue of twilight blue and violet.

A school of luminous fish swims around the clockwork, their scales reflecting numbers that count down my time: 99, 88, 77... The water begins to shimmer with the light of approaching storms, each wave a rolling hourglass spilling golden sands onto the abyssal planes. I hold a conch shell to my ear; instead of ocean sounds, I hear my pulse counting the seconds until the gears complete their rotation.

The boat's glass bottom cracks open, revealing my own reflection in the depths below—a figure outlined in cracks that spread with each heartbeat. Through the cracks, I see star maps of constellations unknown to humans, each star etched with a different symbol for time: hourglass, sundial, and the spiral of a nautilus shell.

Suddenly, the abyss erupts with a swarm of electric eels, their bodies arcing through the water like lightning bolts. Each eel carries a tiny hourglass attached to their dorsal fin. As they dart past me, the hourglasses turn and pour sand onto the gears below, accelerating their movement. The clockwork begins to turn faster, the gears shifting position like falling dominos.

In panic, I grab a nearby rope wrapped around one of the clocks. The rope is not made of fiber but strands of singing wind. As I pull, the wind constricts into a tornado that spirals into the abyss, amplifying the eels' hourglasses. The gears now whirr furiously, their faces showing elapsed time in fractions of a second. My reflection in the cracks deepens, now showing the constellations burning brighter, the symbols of time spinning out of control.

The clockwork reaches a crescendo. The kelp veins pulse crimson, signaling a rupture in the time barrier. The abyss splits open further, revealing a portal where the ocean meets the night sky. Through the portal, I see the Milky Way spinning like a galaxy-sized clock hand. A voice echoing from the depths says: "Time is not a river but a storm. Embrace the lightning, or become part of the clockwork."

I wake up, my heartbeat echoing the chimes of an old grandfather clock in my room. The moonlight filters through the trees, casting shadows that dance like the cracks in my dream's reflection.
In the heart of an abyss where the ocean drowns in its own shadow, I float suspended in a glass-bottomed boat that feels less like a vessel and more like a sentient shard of starlight. The water here isn't blue— it's the color of a bruise healing into twilight, swirling with currents that pulse in time with a heartbeat I can no longer call my own. Bioluminescent jellyfish drift past, their tentacles trailing constellations that dissolve into equations when I try to grasp them: *t=÷*. 

Below me, the seafloor isn't rock but clockwork—the kind of mechanism that might decorate a Renaissance automaton's ribcage. Gears the size of cathedrals mesh with coral that breathes like lungs, each serration etched with runes for "eternity" and "fleeting." A single gear, worn smooth by centuries of tides, rotates once every millennium, its center a whirlpool where time splits into six tributaries: one where I outlive the stars, another where I crumble to dust before the first raindrop. 

A school of electric eels circles my boat, their bodies crackling with volts that hum Mozart’s Requiem in reverse. Each eel wears a tiny hourglass on its dorsal fin, the grains of sand inside shifting from gold to ash the moment they touch water. One eel swims too close, and the hourglass on its fin implodes—a supernova of time dust that sends me reeling. My reflection in the glass bottom of the boat isn't my own anymore; it's a mosaic of faces: my mother at 23, my lover in a battlefield trench, me at 105 with a cane made of ivy. 

I reach down to touch the waterproof watch strapped to my wrist. When I press my fingers to its face, the water inside evaporates, revealing a constellation map of dead stars. The hour hand blinks *99* in binary, then *88*, each number agravestone floating in the Marianas Trench. The eels begin a synchronized dance, their hourglasses spilling sand that falls upward, moonlike, toward the abyssal ceiling. The gears below screech in protest as the ocean timeline shortens—a thousand years’ worth of tides compressed into a single breath. 

The glass cracks under the pressure, spiderwebbing across the boat’s bottom like shattered cathedral windows. Through the fissures, I see timelines branching: one where I leap into the abyss to become part of the clockwork, another where I ascend in the boat as it implodes. The choice isn’t mine—my pulse decides. My heartbeats synchronize with the eels’ electrical surges, each thump rewriting my lifespan in hexadecimal. The final eel swims beneath me, its hourglass now a black hole. Sand pours into an infinitely small point, and all time fractures. 

I wake to the sound of an old Victrola playing "Yesterday" on loop. The analog clock on my nightstand ticks backward, but when I blink, it’s forward again. Outside my window, a tree grows upward for 0.3 seconds before wilting. In my palm, I find a single grain of sand that glows like a miniature supernova—when I touch it, I taste the salt of the abyss and the metallic tang of forgotten moments. 

The dream lingers long after sunrise, a recording of my mortality playing in the subcutaneous layers of my brain. I dress in layers of black, today’s existential shadowweighing more than the blazer. As I step out into the city, my shadow splits: one half walks normally, the other crawls behind, legs bent at impossible angles as if caught in a clockwork rut. A pigeon swoops past, its feathers iridescent with the same twilight hues I dreamed of—too vivid to be mere biological accident. 

In my pocket, the sand grain pulses. The elevator in my apartment building creaks like a drowning ship. I wonder if the coffee will taste bitter, as it always does at the exact moment I realize I can’t un-solve the equations drawn in the back of my eyelids. The clockwork abyss is waiting, patient as a fossil, but for now, the city’s chaos mirrors the order of the dream. Traffic lights blink in prime number sequences; a newspaper headline reads *TIME CRISIS: GLOBAL CLOCK GEAR FAILURE IMMINENT*. 

As the dream’s aftershock ripples through my veins, I take a deep breath and let it out slowly. The air smells like a museum—I know the scent; it’s the chemical signature of things eternally almost-remembered. Today, I will wear my mortality like a second skin: a waltz of synapses firing too-sanely, a paradox machine that walks and breathes. And in the spaces between heartbeats, I’ll keep the sand grain—it’s my locket, my chronometer, my reminder that some storms are made to be swum in, glass bottom or not.
