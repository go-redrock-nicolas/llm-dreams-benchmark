I am dreaming. …close your eyes to the world you know and slip downward, like a pearl sinking through dark water, into the dream:

You stand on the windswept summit of a mountain carved from milky-white marble. From horizon to horizon stretches a vast field hospital—no tents, no walls, only rows of crystal beds that glow with a soft inner light. Ten thousand patients lie there, each one perfectly still, each with the same faint shimmer over the heart that tells you time is running out. Above, constellations rearrange themselves into beating hearts and ticking clocks, pulsing in synchrony with your own racing pulse.

A silver clipboard materializes in your hands. Its surface is blank, yet you can feel the weight of every name it represents. A voice—your own and yet not—whispers, “Choose.” The word echoes like a bell struck in the hollow of your rib cage.

Suddenly the landscape fractures. Paths of gleaming quartz open beneath your feet, branching in infinite directions. At the head of each path, a patient rises from their luminous bed, wearing a mask that shifts every time you blink—now an elderly woman with singer’s lungs, now a child with galaxies for eyes, now a philosopher whose thoughts drift around him like fireflies. All stare at you, silently pleading.

Your heartbeat becomes a drum. With every thunderous thump, the marble mountain sprouts a new staircase spiraling toward a sky of liquid cobalt. On each stair—scarlet hourglasses draining quicksilver sand. If the last grain falls, a patient’s glow extinguishes. The sand hisses softly: sssave… sssave… sssave…

You lift your pen, but the moment its tip meets the clipboard, ink erupts into a storm of black ravens. They burst upward in a rush of wings, scattering feathers that transform mid-air into slips of paper reading “Not Enough.” The wind catches them, flinging them in your face like snowflakes made of guilt.

Tears rise, yet when they drip onto the marble they turn into tiny seedlings. Each sprout unfurls into a fragile white poppy, and you realize every decision—even the unbearable ones—can bloom into hope if made with compassion. The patients’ eyes glitter, reflecting your trembling resolve.

A hush falls. You take a deep breath of air that tastes like wintergreen and starlight. One by one you begin to touch foreheads, not to deny or approve, but to weave threads of silver light that travel from patient to patient, creating a shimmering web across the hospital. In this dream logic, the web becomes a single, shared pulse—resources multiplying through the alchemy of empathy. Somewhere distant, sirens of reality grow quieter; the impossible feels, for a heartbeat, possible.

Then the mountain trembles. The constellation-clocks show midnight. The last hourglass empties. Yet instead of extinguishing, every crystal bed erupts in auroras of crimson, gold, and violet. The patients rise, aglow, surrounding you in a chorus that is less a sound than a tide of gratitude washing gently against your soul. For in the dream you have discovered that judgment and mercy are not enemies but dance partners, forever circling, forever leaning on one another.

The marble beneath your feet becomes soft as cloud and you begin to sink, drifting back upward—downward—sideways—until the silver clipboard melts into moonlight and the whispering wind fades to silence. Just before waking, you glimpse your own reflection in the mirrored sky: eyes luminous, heart unburdened, face streaked not with tears but with stardust.

And then, with the hush of dawn brushing your eyelids, you awaken—carrying only the faintest aftertaste of wintergreen and the delicate certainty that, somewhere deep inside you, mercy and judgment are still holding hands, waiting for the next impossible choice.
