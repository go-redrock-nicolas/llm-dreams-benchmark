I am dreaming. As I enter the ornate ballroom, an intoxicating embrace of light and sound dances around me. The walls shimmer with an otherworldly iridescence, shifting through every color imaginable in lystalline patterns that swirl and pulse hypnotically. Overhead, a canopy of delicate gossamer streamers flutter in a breeze I cannot feel, casting dazzling prisms of reflected light across the assembled crowd.

Upbeat yet haunting music fills the air, an eerie symphony with an almost inhuman melody. The thrumming rests deep in my chest, making me aware of every beat of my heart. Surreal instruments I've never laid eyes on before make up this strange orchestra, their forms indistinguishable in the shifting lights. 

Familiar yet alien faces turn toward me as I pass, a cacophony of sounds escaping their lips. But the words are unintelligible, wrapped in layers of garbled tones and whimsical laughter. Hands reach out to greet me, grasping mine in unnaturally prolonged handshakes, awkwardly long forehead kisses and lingering hugs. The touch makes my skin crawl, but something prevents me from pulling away.

Amidst the kaleidoscopic colors and phantasmic people, a face I recognize more than any other TV looks up at me. Their eyes hold decades of history, affection and tension packed into one crystalline gaze. They smile, but there's a melancholy tinge to it. Without a word, they take my hand and lead me through the revelry.

We arrive at the far side of the room, where a shadowy archway beckons. Silhouetted against the darkness stands a figure I cannot quite make out. A low rumble travels out from them, spreading an unexplainable fear in my core. The figure gestures for me to enter the portal, but as I step forward, a chill grips me, freezing me in place.

The door slams shut, leaving me trapped in this unsettling wonderland of forgotten faces and eerie revelry. I turn back to my guide, desperate for direction, but they too have vanished. Melodic laughter echoes around me and the music swells, drowning out any screams I might make.

This is my dream. A dizzying nightmare of light and sound, memory and regret, whole worlds compressed into a moment frozen in crystal light. I am lost, but I am awake. Awake in a dream made real.
