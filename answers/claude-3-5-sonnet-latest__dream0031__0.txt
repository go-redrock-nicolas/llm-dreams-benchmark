I am dreaming. I'm on a crowded subway when suddenly all the lights go out and the train stops between stations. The initial darkness is absolute, like being wrapped in black velvet, but then something extraordinary begins to happen. The metallic walls of the subway car start to emit a soft, pulsing bioluminescence in swirling patterns of deep blue and violet, reminiscent of deep-sea creatures. The frightened murmurs of passengers transform into a harmonious, ethereal humming that seems to vibrate through my bones.

The floor beneath my feet becomes transparent, revealing we're no longer in a tunnel, but floating through an endless cosmic ocean. Schools of celestial fish with bodies made of stardust swim past our windows, leaving trails of shimmering light in their wake. The other passengers begin to change too - their business suits and casual wear metamorphosing into flowing garments that seem woven from moonbeams and aurora borealis.

I feel myself becoming lighter, my physical form starting to merge with the ambient light. My fingers leave traces in the air like brush strokes of liquid silver. The subway car's ceiling dissolves completely, opening up to a vast expanse where nebulae dance and distant galaxies spin like cosmic ballerinas.

Time becomes fluid - minutes might be centuries, seconds could be millennia. The collective consciousness of everyone in the car melds together into a shared dream-state, our thoughts visible as colorful ribbons of light intertwining above our heads. We're all connected now, part of this surreal journey through space and consciousness.

The humming grows louder, more musical, as if the universe itself is singing through us. Each breath draws in stardust, each exhale releases small constellations. We're traveling somewhere beyond conventional reality, beyond the boundaries of normal dreams, into a realm where the laws of physics dance with pure imagination...
