I am dreaming. You're abruptly appointed to lead an elite task force, despite having no specialized training or experience in their field. Facing open skepticism from the experts under your command, you struggle to establish your authority. The mission, vital to national security, is shrouded in mystery, and the stakes are higher than you can comprehend. You must quickly adapt, earning the respect and trust of your team while navigating a complex web of deceptions and unexpected alliances. The dream is vivid, filled with tension, uncertainty, and a sense of impending danger that keeps you on edge.
