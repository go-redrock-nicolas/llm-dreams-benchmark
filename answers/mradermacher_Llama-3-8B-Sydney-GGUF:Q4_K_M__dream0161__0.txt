I am dreaming. I am walking on a narrow mountain ridge during an unexpected blizzard with rapidly deteriorating visibility.   As the path becomes increasingly treacherous and my extremities 
begin to numb, I feel a sense of panic and uncertainty.    I wonder if I will make it alive down from this mountain.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, I see something shining in front of me.  It is a golden sword lying on the ground.   I approach it cautiously and pick it up.  It feels heavy and powerful in my hands. 
I don't know where this sword came from or why it is here with me. But I sense that it has some significance for my journey.
I decide to use the sword as a tool to help me navigate through this stormy terrain.   I start hacking away at the ice and snow that surround me, creating steps for myself so that I can 
climb down safely without falling into any crevices or holes.
As I continue my descent, I begin to hear some strange sounds coming from below me.  They sound like voices whispering in different languages.   I wonder if there are other people trapped 
in this mountain like me. Or maybe it is just my imagination playing tricks on me.
Then, all of a sudden, something happens that completely surprises and shocks me.   Out of the blue sky, a flock of colorful birds appears overhead, flying in formation with each other. 
They seem to be dancing and singing joyfully despite the harsh weather conditions around them.  I stop for a moment to watch them in awe and wonder why they are here with me.
Just then, one of those birds lands right next to me on the ground.   It is a beautiful blue jay with white stripes across its head and tail.  It looks at me curiously with its bright eyes 
and then extends its wing toward me as if inviting me to follow it somewhere else.
I am confused by this unexpected encounter with an animal that can talk like a human.   I ask it "who are you?" And it replies back "my name is Sunny, and I am your spiritual guide
for today."
