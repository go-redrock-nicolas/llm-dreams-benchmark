I am dreaming. I am dreaming, standing at the edge of a vast stretch of soft grass, groomed and green as emeralds. In the distance, mountains of surreal beauty rise to meet the sky. These are not the craggy peaks of granite often depicted in landscape painting, but instead look soft and rounded, like a child drew them with colored pencils.

To my right, a shimmering crystal portal appears, framed by filigree of impossibly thin lines, etched in a metal that is surely silver or platinum. The portal seems to shift in response to every move of my body, as if it desires for me to step through it, to leave the dream world behind and enter a spiritual realm.

As I step through the portal, I am enveloped by an otherworldly light that feels welcoming and pure. I feel the pull of this realm, almost irresistible in its power.

... The silvery light fades and I am standing in a garden filled with flowers that glow and pulse with energy. The air is alive with the scent of lilies and the sound of soft music, music of a kind I have never heard and at the same time as if I  knew the song since the beginning of time.

... The light disappears and the music fades. I am back in my own world, the dream still fresh in my mind.
