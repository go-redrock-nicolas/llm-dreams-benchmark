I am dreaming.  

Soft moonlight spills through soaring arches of living crystal, each facet glowing with an inner tide of color—lavender, sea-foam green, rose quartz. Beneath my feet, the floor pulses like gentle ripples across a still lake, sending warmth through my soles and drawing me forward. Through the alcove ahead, lanterns fashioned from giant dew-drop shells hang in the air, each one playing a different harmonic chime whenever a breeze stirs its silken threads.  

Stepping into the clearing, I find a circle of strangers—faces both familiar and strange, each marked by stories I sense rather than see. They sit upon mushroom-like stools whose caps shift in hue as you touch them: some go from sapphire blue to sunset orange, others from emerald to buttercup yellow. A low hum of shared breath rises around me, a living chorus of welcome.  

As they welcome me into their circle, I notice how each person holds in their hands a slender staff tipped with a broken seashell, a feather, or a softened crystal shard. In unison, they raise their staves toward the center, where a shallow pool of molten silver waits. Words form in the air—curving like ribbons—inviting me to bring my own token. Trembling, I reach into my pocket and find an object I did not know I carried: a tiny, smoky quartz heart.  

When I place it on the pool’s surface, the silver ripples outward in concentric waves. Each wave carries a different memory: the crack of a door at midnight, a favorite lullaby sung wrong, the first time I looked in the mirror and didn’t know who I saw. And with each wave’s ebb, I feel a gentle unburdening, as if these pains are being drawn into the silvery water, transmuted into pure, pulsing light.  

One of the survivors—a tall figure draped in vines of lavender blossoms—reaches out and brushes a hand along my arm. Where her fingertips graze, old scars shimmer and rearrange into delicate line drawings: a phoenix rising, a compass, a steady heart. I realize that each of us carries not just our hurt, but also the architecture of our healing, mapped across our skin like constellations.  

They guide me to stand at the pool’s edge as they begin a ritual I never imagined: they chant in a language born of sighs and birdcalls, weaving the in-and-out of breath into a living tapestry of sound. Above us, the moon’s reflection dances atop the pool in fractal patterns, and petals of night-blooming lilies drift down, each releasing a tiny spark that pulses once, then gently fades.  

I close my eyes and am transported into a silent garden of memory: I see myself as a child, dancing barefoot in tall grass; I see the moment I first sealed away my tears; I see the echo of my own laughter, long forgotten. The survivors’ chant swells until it becomes my own voice, singing a lullaby of acceptance. With each note, the heavy cloak of past trauma loosens at my shoulders. My chest unclenches; my breath deepens until I feel the sky inside me, vast and open.  

When I open my eyes, the pool has turned to glass, reflecting a sky so star-dense it seems alive. The survivors rise, extending hands toward me. “Walk with us,” they say, each voice a different instrument in a grand symphony. “We will show you the paths of your healed self.”  

Together, we step away from the circle into a tunnel of intertwined willow branches whose leaves glow with a pale green fire. With every step, my heart feels lighter, my mind quieter, and an unshakable knowing blooms within me: that I belong to this circle, that my story is not over, and that here—among these kindred souls—I am being remade.  

And as I drift deeper into this dream, I understand at last that healing is not a solitary quest, but a dance shared beneath strange lights, with voices that sing us back to ourselves.
