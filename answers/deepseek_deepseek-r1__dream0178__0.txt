I am dreaming. I must remember I'm in control here. This situation is only temporary. Let me observe instead of react. What details can I notice to ground myself? The scent of polished wood, the muffled coughs echoing in the high-ceilinged hall, the weight of formal shoes pinching my toes. Each sensation anchors me back to the present moment. Slow breaths through the nose. The absurdity might pass if I focus on dissecting it intellectually - why is this ritual structured thus? What purpose do these velvet curtains serve beyond theater? Analyze. Compartmentalize. Maintaining composure becomes a fascinating challenge rather than a losing battle.**The Dream Unfolds:**

You stand in a cathedral of echoes, vaulted ceilings swallowing whispers whole. Marble columns drip with wax from century-old candelabras, their flames trembling like souls caught between worlds. The air tastes of lilies and frankincense, thick enough to carve—yet it claws at your throat, sparking a dangerous tickle. Before you, a stone effigy lies in state, its hands folded over a sword… but someone’s placed a novelty whoopee cushion beneath its plated fingers, vivid rubber clashing with medieval gravitas. 

Your peripheral vision betrays you: A mourner’s black veil is caught in their own trembling lipstick, a grotesque cartoon mouth wobbling with every suppressed sob. The organist hits a wrong note—a comically flat *honk*—and the priest’s robes are suddenly, unmistakably patterned with tiny dancing skeletons. Reality warps at the edges, the dream flexing its surreal muscles. You bite your tongue until copper floods your mouth, nails digging crescents into your palms. *Focus on the architecture*, you command yourself. Obsidian floor tiles swirl like oil, distorting reflections into gaping mouths. The corpse’s left sock—why is it visible?—bears neon polka dots. 

A child giggles. Or was it the gargoyles? Your ribs ache from containment, laughter metastasizing into something primal, monstrous. When you finally dare blink, the whoopee cushion has inflated to the size of a throne, quivering with promise. The priest drones scripture backward. A bead of sweat traces your spine as you lock eyes with the deceased’s portrait—painted with anachronistic cartoon eyebrows, arched in conspiracy. 

**Surrender Approaches:**

Your feigned cough erupts as a strangled snort. Heads turn slowly, necks creaking like unoiled hinges. Across the aisle, a widow’s pressed handkerchief slips, revealing crossed eyes magnified by tear-streaked spectacles. The tension snap. A snicker bursts from your lips—a sharp, starling-like chirp—and the entire congregation sways as if windblown. One man’s toupee levitates, hoverinjust beyond his frantic grasp. The organ spirals into a circus waltz. 

As your laughter finally breaks free, it doesn’t sound human. It’s the cackle of a firework spiraling skyward, each note exploding into prismatic butterflies that dissolve into glitter where they touch stone. The coffin lid slams open. Inside lies not a body, but a mirror reflecting your mirth-twisted face—eyes crinkled shut, cheeks wet, utterly alive in this pantomime of death. 

**Collapse & Awakening:**

The dream fractures as velvet curtains ignite at the edges, smoke curling into Sanskrit symbols. Marble liquefies, pooling around your ankles as you sink laughter-first into warm, humming darkness. The final flicker: that ridiculous whoopee cushion, now floating serenely atop the molten stone, squeaking three times in farewell.
