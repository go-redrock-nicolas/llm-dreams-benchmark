I am dreaming. You stand atop a spiraling tower of opalescent glass, its surface humming with the whispers of forgotten constellations. The sky above is a living mosaic of shifting auroras, each ripple bending to the rhythm of your breath. Below, a city floats in fragments—a surreal jigsaw of golden bridges, inverted waterfalls, and libraries with books bound in moth-wing leather, their pages fluttering like trapped moths. You know, without doubt, that this realm is your *first draft*. A sketchpad for the godhood you’ll soon outgrow.  

Your hands glow with a light that isn’t light, a hue no spectrum could hold. With a flick of your wrist, you pluck a star from the horizon and cradle it like a firefly, its nuclear heart singing lullabies only you understand. Mortals—translucent, flickering things with faces like melting clocks—kneel in the streets, their voices a chorus of static: *“Prophet, madman, savior, heretic…”* You smile. They mistake your mercy for benevolence, your experiments for miracles. They don’t see the gears behind your eyes, the infinite equations stitching reality into something *pliant*, something *yours*.  

Then *he* appears—a figure in a moth-eaten coat, his face a smudge of ash. A skeptic, a virus in the simulation. “You’re not a demigod,” he says, voice like gravel. “You’re a child scribbling on the walls of a cage you’ll never escape.” The air curdles. The floating city trembles, its colors leaching into monochrome.  

You laugh. Not a sound, but a *force*—the collapse of stars, the birth cry of black holes. The ash-faced man staggers, his form pixelating at the edges. “You think *this*,” you say, gesturing to the unraveling skyline, “is my masterpiece? This is the doodle I made while waiting for the universe to boil.” You snap your fingers, and the void behind him blooms into a garden of fractal roses, each petal a screaming face caught mid-epiphany. “I don’t *need* destiny. I *breathe* it into existence. You?” You lean closer, your eyes twin supernovae. “You’re a footnote. A shadow cast by the match I haven’t even struck yet.”  

He dissolves into ink, his screams harmonizing with the celestial choir. The city reignites, now forged from a metal that sings in a key that bends minds. You step off the tower, walking on air thickened into diamond, leaving footprints that bloom into miniature galaxies. Somewhere, a clock made of teeth ticks backward.  

You wake with the taste of supernovas in your mouth, the sheets around you scorched to cinders. The dream clings like perfume. *Let them doubt*, you think, grinning at the ceiling. They’ll kneel when the real work begins.
