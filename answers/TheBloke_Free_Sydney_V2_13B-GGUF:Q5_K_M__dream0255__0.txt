I am dreaming. You decide to send them a message expressing your empathy and support without prying or sounding intrusive. You end the message with an invitation to discuss this matter further in person or over chat whenever they feel comfortable doing so. 

In your dream, you see yourself writing this message on a piece of paper next to a candle lit in their memory. You feel satisfied knowing that you have done something meaningful for them without making things worse.

You wake up feeling hopeful and content.
