I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of an ethereal forest, the verdant canopy above stretching endlessly into the twilight sky, where stars twinkle with a surreal intensity. The cool night air brushes against your skin, carrying with it the scent of jasmine and the distant sound of a melody that seems to be whispered by the wind itself. Here, in this dreamscape, your emotions materialize into tangible forms, swirling around you in a dance of vibrant colors.

As you step forward, each footfall sinking softly into the mossy ground, you become acutely aware of the feelings you hold for someone who embodies the unpredictable nature of the dream you are in. Their presence is both tantalizing and frustrating, a magnetic force that pulls you in with intense moments of connection, only to leave you adrift in sudden bouts of distance and unavailability.

The forest around you mirrors this emotional turmoil. Trees with leaves that shimmer in shades of longing and frustration part to reveal paths illuminated by beams of hopeful light, yet shadowed corners hint at the uncertainty and fear that gnaw at your heart. The inconsistent interest from this person manifests in the dream as shifting landscapes: one moment, you're walking beside a serene river where the water murmurs secrets of unity and understanding; the next, you're struggling through a thicket of confusion and doubt, thorns of rejection pricking at your resolve.

In this dream, you realize the importance of protecting your own needs. You summon a cloak around you, woven from threads of self-respect and resilience, its fabric shimmering with an inner light. As you continue your journey, this cloak grows heavier and more comforting, a shield against the chill of emotional neglect.

Determined to respond to the relationship's uncertainty, you search for a guide within this dreamworld. From the depths of the forest emerges a wise, ancient creature—a stag with antlers that stretch towards the heavens like branches of a sacred tree. Its eyes, deep pools of understanding, reflect your inner turmoil but also your strength.

The stag leads you to a clearing bathed in the soft glow of the moon, where you sit and listen as it imparts wisdom about balancing your emotions with your needs. You learn to set boundaries, represented in the dream by drawing a circle around yourself with a stick dipped in starlight. Inside this circle, you feel safe, your heart protected yet still open to the possibilities of love.

As the dream nears its end, the stag fades, and the forest begins to dissolve into the mist. You awaken with a sense of clarity, understanding that while the relationship may continue its dance of inconsistency, you now have the tools—the cloak of self-respect, the circle of boundaries—to navigate it while safeguarding your own emotional well-being. The dream fades, but its lessons linger, a vivid tapestry of emotions and resilience etched into your subconscious.
