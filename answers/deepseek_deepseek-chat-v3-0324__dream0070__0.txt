I am dreaming. The ornate conference hall around me shimmers like a mirage. Candles flicker in concentric circles across the ceiling, their orange reflections dancing upon the obsidian table where I sit facing three shadowy figures. Their features shift with each flicker, one moment resembling ancient monarchs, the next morphing into modern world leaders. The scent of pine resin and gunpowder hangs thick in the electrified air.

Within my chest blooms an impossible rose - its thorned roots tightening around my ribs, petals unfurling against my lungs. Each diplomatic phrase I speak releases perfume into the chamber, and to my horror, the delegates inhale deeply, their eyes glazing. My words are working too well. The northern ambassador begins weeping black tears that crystallize upon hitting the table, forming fragments of a shattered peace treaty.

Through the stained glass windows, I see our respective armies already moving - soldiers transforming into chess pieces as they cross the border. My next words emerge as fluttering doves that dissolve in midair. I realize with dreamlike certainty that the true negotiations never began. The longer we talk, the more real the war becomes. My left hand turns to marble, and I understand this transformation will continue unless I speak the unspoken truth we've all avoided. But what is it? The answer waits just beyond consciousness, like a forgotten word poised on the tip of the tongue.
