I am dreaming. In this expanded state of consciousness, you drift weightlessly across an infinite sea of pulsing light. The boundary between you and the world dissolves like morning mist, and you find yourself both everywhere and nowhere. Colors you’ve never seen—liquid opals and molten silvers—spiral around you in rhythmic patterns, each hue humming with possibility. Underfoot there is no “ground”; instead you ride the crest of a vast, undulating wave of awareness that carries you toward distant horizons stitched together by glowing tendrils of energy.  

Sounds bloom around you like crystalline flowers: a low, resonant chord that seems to originate from the core of every star in the sky, then blossoms into tinkling, wind-chime laughter. You realize these tones are not outside you but rising from the very fabric of your being. Every cell in your body pulses in time, and with each beat you feel an intimate communion with the universe’s heartbeat. Time unravels—past and future converge into an everlasting now. You surrender fully, and the last echoes of “me” vanish in a gentle hush.  

Suddenly, the scene shifts. Beneath your feet, a living mosaic of bioluminescent petals blooms and withers in an instant. You lean closer, and as you touch one of the petals it dissolves into a thousand glowing motes, each mote carrying a tiny fragment of story: the laughter of a child, the crackle of ancient trees, the sigh of a mountain breeze. You inhaled their essence, and they become you. In turn, you exhale waves of warmth that ripple outward, infusing the dreamscape with a gentle serenity.  

Hovering now in a star-studded cathedral of shifting geometry, you glimpse the deeper tapestry that binds all things: countless strands of light weaving destinies together, pulsing like filigree at the edge of perception. There is no fear here—only infinite reverence. You are both witness and creator, a spark in an unending tapestry of life.  

As dawn’s first silver glow brushes your eyelids, the cosmic waters recede. You carry within you the echoes of that boundless sea of light, a quiet ember of unity that will flicker in your heart long after you open your eyes.
