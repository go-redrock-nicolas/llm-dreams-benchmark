I am dreaming. I feel a sudden cold breeze, as if someone just entered the room. Turning my head slowly, I see a figure standing in the shadow of the doorway. At first, I think it's a stranger, but the presence feels familiar. The figure steps into the light, and I recognize them—a close friend or someone I thought I could trust. Their eyes are hollow, and there's a sadistic grin across their face. I start to ask questions... Why? How could you? They simply point to a chair across the room, made of twisted metal and bound with chains. 

Walking toward it, hesitant and fearful, I feel the floor beneath me become uneven, like the ground is made of liquid. The walls start to warp and bleed a dark substance, oozing down like tar. The figure follows me, and their voice echoes in my mind—no sound, just intrusive thoughts: *"Sit. You need to know the truth."*

Sinking into the chair, I feel the cold metal bite into my skin. The figure stands behind me, gripping my shoulders tightly. A screen materializes in front of me, showing snippets of memories—conversations, shared moments—all altered. I see myself trusting them, relying on their words, but the images shift. Their smiles grow wider, their expressions change to ones of mockery and deceit. 

The screen fractures, revealing a void. From the void comes a voice, deep and distorted—a chorus of whispers that say *"You were always meant to see this. The truth was hidden in plain sight."* The scene shifts again, now in a forest. The trees are gnarled, their bark cracked and oozing the same dark substance. The figure is no longer with me; instead, I am alone. The forest path splits into two directions. One path is bright and sunny, filled with laughter and familiar faces. The other is dark, shadowy, lined with flickering torches and the sound of weeping. 

A raven lands on a nearby branch, one eye black, the other white. It tilts its head and speaks in the figure's voice: *"Which truth will you follow now?"* 

As I stand there, paralyzed, the forest starts to collapse into itself, the sky turning crimson. The ground beneath my feet shakes violently. I hear the figure's laughter echo through the trees, distant but mocking. The dream ends as I awaken gasping, the remnants of the raven's stare seared into my mind, and the weight of distrust pressing down on my chest like a physical force.
