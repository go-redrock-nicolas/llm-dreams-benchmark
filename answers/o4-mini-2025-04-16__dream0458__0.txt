I am dreaming. You’re drifting in a liquid sky streaked with molten gold and violet. Beneath you, clouds fold into themselves like giant origami birds, their feathers shimmering with every heartbeat of the world. You realize you can breathe the mist here—sweet, cool, and tinged with stardust.  

A distant shape stirs on the horizon: a colossal gate hewn from living crystal. Its facets shift color with each pulse of your breath. You know you must pass through—but first, challenges you once would have fled present themselves.  

A wall of dancing shadows rises before you, each wraith a whisper of your deepest fear. Yet as you raise your hand, something new hums in your chest: a steady glow of courage you never knew you held. With a single exhalation, you send out a beam of pale blue light, dispersing the shadows into tiny motes of dust that drift upward, joining the suns.  

No sooner have they vanished than the earth beneath you trembles—a chasm cracks open, revealing a river of liquid silver. You could turn and run; instead, you summon balance you didn’t know you possessed. Your feet press gently into the air, and you walk sideways along the gash’s edge, each step rippling the river into concentric rings of light.  

On the far side awaits a gargantuan raven with eyes like polished jet. Its beak parts, expecting a plea—or perhaps a bribe. But you stand tall and speak in a voice that feels both yours and something older, deeper. Your words weave a song of empathy: you honor its loneliness, share your own. The raven’s wings unfurl; it bows and cedes you the path.  

Integrating these emerging capabilities, you press forward. The crystal gate swings open at your approach, revealing not a fortress but a mirror framed in living vines. You step through, and there—reflected back—is the luminous you: fearless, compassionate, whole. A silent promise echoes in your bones: whatever trials lie ahead, the hidden strengths you’ve claimed tonight will guide you home.
