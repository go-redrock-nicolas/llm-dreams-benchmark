I am dreaming. The city around me is a labyrinth of towering spires and twisting alleyways, all bathed in the eerie glow of a twilight that never fades. The buildings are made of a shimmering, iridescent material—sometimes glass, sometimes stone, sometimes something else entirely—shifting like liquid when I blink. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as if the city itself is alive, whispering secrets in a language just beyond comprehension.  

My heart pounds—I have an important meeting, one that feels like it will decide everything, but the address is a mystery. The streets rearrange themselves when I turn my back; signs flicker between languages I don’t recognize, symbols twisting like living things. A clock suspended in the sky—no, embedded in the clouds—ticks down relentlessly, though its hands move backward, forward, in spirals.  

I start running, but my legs move through syrup, the ground undulating beneath me. Faces in the crowd blur as they pass—some familiar, some monstrous, some shifting between the two. A woman with moth wings whispers directions, but her voice is static. A child made of smoke points down an alley that wasn’t there a second ago.  

Then, the ground gives way. I’m falling—no, floating—through layers of the city, past rooms suspended in midair, libraries with books that rewrite themselves, theaters where the audience is made of mannequins with my face. A door appears, glowing faintly. The meeting. It must be.  

I reach for the handle—  

And wake up, the echo of a voice I almost recognize still hanging in the air.
