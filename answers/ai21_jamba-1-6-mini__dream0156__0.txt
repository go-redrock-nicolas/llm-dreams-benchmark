I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a breathtakingly vast digital library. Shelves tower above you, stretching into the infinity of the ceiling, each filled with glowing holographic books. Every title pulses softly, inviting you to explore its secrets. In this dreamscape, the library is a manifestation of your online life—every scroll, every like, every comment exists as a tangible volume.

You reach for a book titled Checking Social Media, and as you open it, the world shifts. Pages flutter like leaves in a storm, each one an individual post or interaction from your digital history. The colors are vivid—a lush green for photos, a deep indigo for private messages—forming a kaleidoscope of your interactions. You feel the weight of it, the sheer volume of time spent here.

Suddenly, a voice calls out to you. It's your mentor, their words echoing over the shelves: "Be mindful of where you spend your time. Every second you give to these insignificant moments chips away at the grand tapestry of your real life." The words resonate deeply, stirring a sense of urgency.

You turn to leave, but the library shifts its form. Now, the books are floating, fluttering around you like ghostly apparitions. They dart away when you try to grasp them, mocking your attempts to capture the fleeting. The voices of your friends, followers, and algorithms blend into a cacophony, drowning you in noise.

Then, amid the chaos, you see a glowing hand mirror lying on a pedestal. You pick it up, and as you peer into its reflective surface, you see not your physical form but a timeline of your digital interactions—likes, comments, moments of joy and frustration, all trailing behind you like footprints in the sand. The reflection shimmers with the ghostly presence of people you've interacted with, each one a ghost of the time spent with them online instead of in person.

The figure of your mentor appears again, this time in person, standing behind you. "Every moment you spend here," they say, "crochets worry and regret into the fabric of your being. Your true self is not found here but in the tangible moments just beyond your reach." You feel a sinking sensation, your chest tightening as you realize the price of your digital indulgence.

The dream ends as you make a silent promise to yourself: to step away from the all-encompassing digital world, to spend less time scrolling and more time back in the physical spaces where true connections thrive. You wake with a clearer perspective, aware of the need to balance your virtual existence with the tangible, enriching experiences of the real world.
