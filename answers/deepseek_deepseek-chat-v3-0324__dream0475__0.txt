I am dreaming. **Dream Journal – Entry: The Bridge of Whispers**  

---

I find myself standing at the edge of an endless chasm, the kind that stretches so far down that the darkness beneath seems to hum with unseen motion. Before me, a narrow rope bridge sways in a wind I cannot feel, its frayed fibers whispering in a language just beyond comprehension. This is the Bridge of Whispers—the path to whatever challenge awaits me on the other side.  

My pulse quickens. The ropes groan, the wooden slats creak, and already I can see fissures forming beneath my feet before I’ve even taken the first step. Worse, I hear *them*—the whispers—murmuring in my ear like a choir of unseen critics:  

*"What if you fall?"*  
*"What if the bridge snaps the moment you’re halfway?"*  
*"What if there’s nothing on the other side worth reaching?"*  

Each question spins into a vision. The ropes unravel. The planks splinter. I plunge into the abyss, surrounded by laughter that tastes like rust. The fall lasts forever.  

But then—a shift.  

A warmth gathers in my chest, a soft glow emanating from within, pushing back against the cold dread. I realize: *this is my dream. My mind. My creation.*  

So I reshape it.  

I exhale, and the chasm’s depth rises, the unseen bottom now visible—a lush valley of silver grass and glowing flowers, cradling the fall. The bridge steadies, woven not with frayed rope but with threads of light. The whispers don’t vanish, but their voices smooth into echoes, no longer sharp with taunts but murmuring:  

*"What if you fly?"*  
*"What if the bridge holds stronger than you feared?"*  
*"What if what waits beyond is wilder than your doubts?"*  

I take the first step. The bridge sighs, but it holds. The wind carries my breath, no longer stolen by fear. With each slow, deliberate movement, the nightmare unravels, rewoven into something daring—something mine.  

When I wake, I carry the knowing: even the deepest chasms are just spaces waiting to be crossed.
