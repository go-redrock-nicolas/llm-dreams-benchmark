I am dreaming. Or maybe I am remembering a nightmare carved too deeply into my soul.  The sky above is a sickly shade of gray, the sun barely peeking through layers of ash and smoke, casting weak, pale light across a desolate wasteland.  The wind howls mournfully, carrying with it the scent of decay and distant fires.  Cities lay in ruins, skeletal remains of once-proud skyscrapers, their windows shattered and their guts spilled, steel bones exposed like the carcasses of long-dead giants.

The ground crunches underfoot as I tread carefully, boots pressing into dry earth mixed with shards of glass and twisted metal.  I am alone—or I think I am.  But silence here is deceptive.  Danger often hides in plain sight.  Creatures born of radiation and desperation roam these lands, mutated and malevolent, their eyes glowing eerily in the haze.  Other survivors too, just as starved, just as hopeless, but hardened by the world’s cruelty.  Trust doesn't exist anymore—not here.  Not in the open.

But I haven't given up.

There’s a rumor passed in whispered conversations around the tiny ember of a fire I managed to build last night: a place untouched by the blackened rot of the world. Eden.  A sanctuary.  Though most dismiss it as a myth, a dream crafted to give false hope to those slipping into madness, I believe there’s truth to it.  I’ve seen things in my travels—strange maps etched into rusted steel, a lone radio crackling with a signal speaking of a valley blooming with life and surrounded by insurmountable peaks, untouched by the fires that scorched the Earth.

I've decided I will find Eden.

My pack, patched together from canvas, leather, and bits of discarded car seats, is heavy with cargo.  Canned food scavenged from decaying grocery stores.  A rusting revolver with only three bullets.  Maps drawn by the hands of the deranged, and always, always a jar of water, more precious than gold.

My first destination is the Radiation Scar—a land mass littered with glowing puddles of death and crawling with things that were once human. They say the path to Eden starts there, where the world meets its most violent end.

As I walk, the atmosphere grows thicker, pressing down as if the weightless air has turned dense and greedy, as though the sky itself wants me to fall. The wind brings with it distant, hollow screams and the low, unnatural hum of energy thrumming in the air—danger calling me to tread lightly.

Suddenly, I am not alone.

A creature emerges from the haze: muscles coiled tight under peeling flesh, its mouth a jagged mess of teeth too large for its skull.  Its eyes seem almost human—pained, pleading, lost. It lets out a guttural snarl and charges.

I step aside just in time, feeling its rotting breath as it passes me by.  I turn, aiming the rusting revolver. One shot. One chance.  The gun clicks—one loud punctuation mark in an otherwise roaring void of chaos.

Friend, foe, or mere byproduct of a broken world—my heart pounds faster than thought.  There is no room for hesitation.

BANG!

The creature collapses, twitching only once before silence swallows it again.

I stand there a moment, breathing hard, the barrel of my gun still faintly warm. Survival, yet again, bought at the price of another piece of my soul.

No matter.

I draw a deep breath, shoulders rising and falling with something between weariness and resolve.  There is too much ahead for mourning.  Eden waits somewhere beyond the darkness. I can feel it, like the faint warmth of long-lost sun on my skin.

With renewed determination, I press on—the horizon shimmering faint and false behind the smoke and sorrow.

And I dream.  Oh, I dream.  Vividly.  Maddeningly.  Of clouds heavy with rain not poison. Of lakes sparkling under golden sun instead of radioactive sludge. Of laughter echoing through the trees instead of screams.  I dream of a life that exists on the other side of war, of pain, of death.

I dream of sanctuary.  I walk into desolation chasing hope.

And so I continue, my footsteps echoing in a world that has forgotten time, step by step, toward something real or illusion—a fool's errand or destiny. Only I know which. 

I walk to Eden.
