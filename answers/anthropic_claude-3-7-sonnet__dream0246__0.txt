I am dreaming. The first crack appears with a sound like distant thunder, barely perceptible beneath my boots. The pristine white expanse—moments ago so peaceful under a cerulean sky—now reveals thin dark lines spreading like lightning across its surface. The mountain speaks in low groans as the snow pack shifts.

My breath crystallizes before me in quick, panicked clouds. The air tastes of metal and ice. Beneath my feet, the once-solid foundation subtly tilts, almost imperceptibly at first, then with growing certainty. The mountain is waking up.

Time stretches and compresses strangely. In slow motion, I watch as the ridge above me transforms—snow particles begin dancing, catching sunlight like diamond dust suspended in air. The beauty is hypnotic and terrifying. A deep, resonant crack echoes through the valley, reverberating in my chest cavity.

The world tilts. What begins as a gentle ripple in the snow becomes a rolling wave. The mountain is liquefying. Massive slabs of snow break free with the sound of splintering glass, tumbling and gathering momentum. The air fills with a roar that drowns all thought.

I'm moving without conscious decision, my body electric with primal fear. The horizon blurs as white engulfs everything. I'm simultaneously floating and sinking, caught in nature's impossible paradox as the boundaries between air and solid dissolve. The cold burns against my skin while silence and thunder occupy the same impossible space.

Light and dark alternate as I'm tossed through this alabaster chaos, losing all sense of direction. The world has become a churning, formless void where up and down have lost their meaning. Through swirling snow, I glimpse fragments of sky—brilliant blue patches that appear and vanish like impossible windows to another reality.

The avalanche and I have become one entity, moving together down the mountain's face in terrible, beautiful unity.
