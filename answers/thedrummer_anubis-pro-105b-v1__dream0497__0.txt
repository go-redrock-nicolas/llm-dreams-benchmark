I am dreaming. As I find myself in a moment of profound presence where my usual anxieties about past and future temporarily dissolve, I feel a weight lift off my shoulders. I can sense the way my body feels on the chair I'm sitting in and how my hand is grasping a cup of coffee. I am more aware than before, and I am realizing that lot of little things annoyed me and made me anxious throughout the day. I know my anxiety is something I have to live with because it feels out of my control to be in it.

In this state, I feel more grounded and connected to the current moment. I take a deep breath and slowly tune into my surroundings again, this time free from the weight of my worries. Itâ€™s a break from my usual stream of thoughts, and I feel at peace for once.
