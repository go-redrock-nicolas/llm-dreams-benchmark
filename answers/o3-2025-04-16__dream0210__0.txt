I am dreaming.

I open my eyes inside an arena that should not be able to exist. It hangs above a black-glass sea, its spiraling tiers floating with no pillars or cables, held aloft by silent columns of violet light that rise from the water like prayers. The air is equal parts salt spray and warm cinnamon, as though the ocean and a bakery have decided to share the same breath. High overhead, instead of a roof, whole constellations whirl in tight, clock-like patterns, ticking away seconds I can feel against my skin.

This is the Helix Championship, a competition whispered about in waking life, but in dreams it blooms into impossible color. The event combines feats of strength, balance, logic, and audacity. It unfolds in four acts: the Ascension Run, the Labyrinth of Mirrors, the Ciphered Gauntlet, and the Duel in the Void. Nobody from my humble, wind-scarred coastal village has ever reached it, yet here I stand with a soft-spun scarf for a banner and training stitched together from afternoons on craggy cliffs.

Across the starting platform, my opponents gleam with obscene advantage. They wear chrome exosuits that hum with stored kinetic energy, helmets threaded with HUD-glittering data, and each one has an entourage of coaches behind glass partitions feeding them real-time algorithms. Their sponsor logos flash like minor deities begging to be worshipped. By contrast, my equipment fits into a canvas satchel that smells faintly of lemon oil: a coil of braided kelp rope my grandmother taught me to weave, a finger-sized compass carved from driftwood, and a pouch of chalk ground from petrified sea foam.

A bronze gong shivers the sky. Act I begins.

Act I: The Ascension Run  
The floor beneath us unspools into a vertical landscape—ledges, dangling hoops, and translucent steps that flicker in and out like shy fireflies. Gravity itself seems coy, tugging sideways one moment and straight down the next. Competitors launch upward with rocket-assisted boots, but I rely on muscle memory from cliff diving: I wait, listening to the rhythm of the floor’s pulses. With each shimmer, I leap to a step just as it stabilizes, treating emptiness like trustworthy ground. Up ahead, a neon-plated athlete miscalculates and collides with a disintegrating platform, his boosters sparking like celebratory fireworks before he tumbles into a penalty zone. Wind stitches tears into my eyes, but I’m laughing—because in this inverted sky-climb, riches actually slow them down; sleek weight is still weight.

Act II: The Labyrinth of Mirrors  
We spill into a hallway of towering panes that reflect not just sight but intention. Every thought spawns a phantom clone that tries to mislead. The wealthy entrants deploy AI filters to re-route false paths, but their software only multiplies their reflections into an army of half-truths. I lower my eyes, breathing in the cedar-smoke scent of the chalk pouch. I mark a spiral on the floor—left by the chalk, right by instinct—and follow the chalk spiral instead of my reflection’s gestures. The maze senses creativity; walls ripple, offering shortcuts when bravery trumps analysis. I emerge ahead of a silver-clad genius still arguing with his own mirages.

Act III: The Ciphered Gauntlet  
An open arena of floating glyphs now stands between me and the final challenge. Each glyph is a puzzle-lock that changes shape with movement: hop on the wrong one and it detonates, spinning you into a time penalty vortex. Competitors huddle around pocket supercomputers, crunching permutations. I squat, draw my grandmother’s compass, and let it spin on a glyph. The compass needle flutters like a hummingbird until it aligns—pointing not north, but toward whichever symbol matches the pulse of the arena’s beating heart. One by one, I choose the living glyphs, feeling their vibration in my ankles, leaving a glowing path of footprints that resemble bioluminescent shells. Spectators above release a hush that falls over the sea like velvet night: most of us never expected the scrappy wildcard to lead.

Act IV: The Duel in the Void  
The floor vanishes; we float in a sphere of starlight stitched by thin silver threads. Two finalists remain: a titan in an armored suit, and me—bare arms, chalk-dusted fingers, heart a kettle-drum. The duel is both physical and mental: each combatant must weave patterns with those threads, shaping the sphere’s gravity while trading physical strikes. He begins with a brute-force tactic, punching a thread so hard it snaps all nearby strands, sending gravity vectors wild; chunks of starry space slam like boulders. I counter by looping my kelp rope around threads that still sing, braiding new lines while sidestepping his haymaker swings. With every knot, I compose a lullaby of force, gently persuading gravity to cradle me and shove him.

When he lunges for a decisive slam, I duck, tighten my final knot, and whisper: “Sleep.” The entire sphere tilts, a soft yawn of physics, and my opponent drifts helplessly into an orbiting ring of soft light that cocoons him—defeated but unharmed. Applause rises in waves, sounding like rain on copper roofs.

The Trophy  
A platform of woven moonbeams lifts me, presenting a seed the size of my palm—pearlescent, warm, and quietly beating. An inscription spirals across its shell: “Plant wherever impossible things must grow.” I clutch it to my chest. The sponsors’ lights flicker, briefly dimmed by something money can’t buy: the raw, irregular miracle of daring.

As I raise the seed, the arena dissolves into dawn. Violet pillars turn to gull cries; the scent of cinnamon becomes sun-heated sand. My grandmother’s chalk spiral unwinds across a real beach at my feet. The seed pulses once—then splits into a burst of color so bright I cannot tell if my eyes are open or closed.

I wake, heartbeat echoing the hidden gong, hands still curved around the dream-trophy, palms dusted with glimmering chalk that smells of cedar and stars.
