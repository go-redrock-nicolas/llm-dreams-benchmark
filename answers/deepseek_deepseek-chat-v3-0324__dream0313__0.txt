I am dreaming. The sky above is not a sky at all, but a vast, rippling ocean suspended upside down—liquid sapphire, shifting and breathing in slow, heavy waves. Its currents drag glittering constellations like fishhooks tearing through the fabric of night. Below me, the ground is made of packed earth and broken mirrors, each shard reflecting distorted pieces of myself—some grinning too wide, some weeping black tears.  

A figure approaches—a creature of moth-eaten velvet and rusted clockwork. Its face is a porcelain mask, cracked down the middle, revealing darkness underneath. It extends a hand, not to touch, but to offer something: a small, throbbing orb the color of a healing bruise.  

*"You'll need this,"* the thing says, its voice the sound of radio static layered with laughter—the kind that’s too loud, the kind that’s barely holding together.  

I snort. *"Oh great, another cosmic paperweight. Does it come with instructions, or do I have to swallow it and hope for subtitles?"*  

The mask tilts. The crack widens. Dark tendrils seep out, curling like smoke, like pleading fingers.  

*"Humor is a noose you’ve fashioned into a necktie,"* it murmurs. *"One day, you’ll forget how to untie it."*  

The orb pulses brighter. I reach for it—because of course I do—but the moment my fingers brush its surface, it bursts into a swarm of tiny silver birds. They spiral upward, vanishing into the ocean-sky, leaving behind only the faintest echo of wings.  

And then, because this is a dream after all, the ground beneath me gives way, and I’m falling—not down, but *sideways*, tumbling through the hollow ribs of some enormous, sleeping beast.  

And I’m still laughing.  

God, I’m *still laughing*.
