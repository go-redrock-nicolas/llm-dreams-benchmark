I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the electric tension of a storm that hasn’t yet broken. You stand at the threshold of a vast, obsidian tower, its surface shimmering like oil on water, reflecting constellations that do not exist in any earthly sky. The ground beneath your feet is not earth but a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard whispering fragments of forgotten failures: *“Not enough. Try harder. Almost.”* You step forward, and the shards knit themselves into a path, glowing faintly like embers underfoot, as though the very universe is holding its breath, waiting for your next move.  

The tower’s entrance yawns open—a mouth of teeth-shaped stalactites and stalagmites, dripping with liquid starlight. Inside, the walls pulse like living flesh, veins of gold coursing with the memories of every sacrifice you’ve made: sleepless nights, meals skipped, voices of loved ones fading into the static of deadlines. At the center of the chamber floats a pedestal of ice, and atop it, a single key forged from moonlight and thorned with shards of diamond. You reach for it, but your hand trembles—not from fear, but the weight of knowing this key unlocks the final door.  

A chorus erupts, dissonant and divine: a thousand voices chanting your name in languages lost to time. The walls peel away like petals of a dying flower, revealing a sky ablaze with auroras that writhe like serpents. A bridge of smoke materializes, arching over an abyss that smells of burnt paper and forgotten dreams. At its zenith hovers a figure—a silhouette with eyes like twin supernovae, holding a scale balanced on a thread. One side bears a single raven’s feather; the other, a vial of your own blood, still dripping.  

“You have measured yourself against the infinite,” the figure intones, its voice a tectonic rumble. “Do you dare weigh your worth?”  

Before you can answer, the bridge dissolves into a flock of paper cranes, each inscribed with a question you’ve never dared ask aloud. They spiral into a cyclone, pulling you into a cavern where the walls are made of ticking clock faces, their hands spinning backward. Here, time unravels: you see yourself as a child, scribbling ambitions in a notebook now yellowed with age; as a teenager, heart pounding at the first flicker of possibility; as the person you are now, standing in a room of mirrors that reflect not your face, but the faces of everyone who doubted you, believed in you, or simply watched you vanish into the chase.  

The final door looms—a monolith of petrified wood, roots clawing into the floor like desperate fingers. You press your palm to it, and it melts away, revealing a garden where every flower is a flickering candle, every tree a scaffold of glowing bones. At its heart is a throne carved from storm clouds, and on it sits a version of yourself you’ve never met: radiant, weary, crowned with a halo of thorns. They hold out their hands, empty and open.  

“The goal was never the end,” this other you murmurs. “It was the fire that forged you. The question is… what will you become *now*?”  

A thunderclap splits the sky. The garden erupts into a tempest of ash and stardust, and you wake just as the first light of dawn bleeds through your curtains, your skin still humming with the echo of infinite possibilities.
