I am dreaming.

The world dims and flickers, and a strange pressure fills my ears—as though the building itself is breathing, exhaling drafts scented with dust and secrets. The walls pulse with a dull red glow, bristling with pipes that hiss and moan with escaping steam. Shards of fractured moonlight slant through high, grimy windows, painting the warped floorboards with silvery silhouettes that shift and tremble.

Each footstep echoes through corridors that seem to bend not with the constraints of reality, but at the whims of some fevered architect. Hallways stretch impossibly long, vanishing into stuttering shadows. Doors rattle quietly in their frames, protesting my presence, and behind some—shapes flicker, amorphous and sharp-edged, pacing with a predatory patience.

As I move, the building reveals its danger: ceilings sag with the promise of collapse, while floorboards splinter and threaten to crumble beneath each tentative step. Somewhere above, a cacophony of frightened fluttering—dozens of birds, trapped and invisible—erupt every time I try a doorknob, drowning out my own ragged breath.

Desperation hammers in my chest. From behind, a noxious fog oozes through the vents, rolling closer with every heartbeat, thick and glimmering, sparking intermittent static arcs along the metal rails of a dizzying staircase. Time bends here; seconds feel like hours, yet the hazards multiply, synchronized to some macabre rhythm.

Suddenly, from the gloom, a faint but radiant blue glow dances atop a cracked EXIT sign at the edge of a hallway that seems more suggestion than reality. The way forward is treacherous: pools of oil shimmer like inkblot portals, and wires, writhing like eels, sway over the path, crackling with stray electricity. Each hazard demands nimble feet and sharper wits.

My fingers graze the crumbling wall for balance, talcum powder chalking my skin, as I dart beneath the sagging wires and skirt across the mosaic of broken glass glinting underfoot. At every turn, new threats blossom—a corridor buckling in fiery waves, invisible hands pounding on locked doors, and, from far below the floorboards, a distant chanting rising and falling like the tide.

Yet, as I press on—heart wild, mind swimming in dizzy wonder—the dangers become more surreal, as though the building’s fabric is thinning. In some places, the wall dissolves to reveal star-flecked voids, tiny galaxies spinning just out of reach; in others, it hardens and closes off with the groan of ancient stone.

At last, battered and trembling but unbroken, I reach the flickering glow of the exit. The door feels cool and solid beneath my palm. I push it open with all my might, stepping into a realm of swirling color and silence—a world remade by hope, where the dangers of the labyrinth fade like mist in the sunrise.

I am dreaming, I realize, and the terror of the trap uncoils, replaced by luminous awe at the strange, audacious beauty of my mind's nocturnal maze.
