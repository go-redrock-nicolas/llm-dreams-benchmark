I am dreaming. I find myself irresistibly drawn to a grand piano that seems to materialize wherever I go. It appears in impossible places - perched atop a mountain peak, floating on the surface of a lake, nestled between ancient trees in a misty forest. Though I've never played a note in my life, my fingers tingle with an otherworldly urge to touch those gleaming ivory keys.

When I finally give in and sit at the bench, the world around me transforms. The air becomes thick and syrupy, time moving like honey dripping from a spoon. My hands hover over the keys, and though I don't consciously move them, they begin to dance across the piano with a life of their own. The music that emerges isn't just sound - it's visible, painting the air with swirling ribbons of color: deep indigos that twist into brilliant golds, crimson streams that pulse like heartbeats.

Each note I play sends ripples through reality itself. Trees bend and sway to my melody, their leaves turning from green to silver. The ground beneath the piano begins to crack, revealing crystals that grow in time with the music. Stars fall from the sky like rain, each one chiming a perfect harmony with my playing.

I realize I'm not just making music - I'm weaving dreams into reality. Every chord progression rewrites the laws of physics, every arpeggio births new constellations. Though I've never studied music, in this dream-space I understand that I'm composing the very fabric of existence, conducting an orchestra of impossible things.

The sensation is both terrifying and exhilarating, like falling upward into an endless sky. I know that when I wake, my fingers won't remember these movements, my mind won't recall these melodies. But in this moment, I am both the musician and the music, the creator and the creation, lost in a symphony of my own impossible making.

The piano keys begin to liquefy beneath my fingers, turning to quicksilver that runs up my arms, and still I play on, becoming one with the instrument, becoming pure music itself...
