I am dreaming. Floating weightlessly in an iridescent sphere of translucent soap bubble walls, I watch in awe as reality bends and morphs around me. The bubble suddenly descends through layers of consciousness, each one a different texture of light and shadow. I pass through a membrane of liquid moonlight that tingles against my ethereal form.
