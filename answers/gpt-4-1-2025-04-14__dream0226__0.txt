I am dreaming. —I find myself on an impossibly wide stage, the kind that seems to stretch out like a vast gray sea beneath the glow of harsh, swinging spotlights. My skin tingles with the bite of cold air and the weight of a thousand unseen eyes. I glance down, heart pounding, and there in my trembling hands is my work—pages overfilled with jagged lines of confession, streaked sentences raw with longing and fear, sketches of my self-doubt made tangible.

A rustling grows from the darkness beyond the footlights—at first, whispers, like a breeze ruffling dead leaves, but soon coalescing into a cacophony of voices. They call out my secrets, reading my fears as if they were their own. “You’re not enough,” they repeat, their words sharp as hail. “This is childish, self-indulgent.” Every critique is a pebble hurled into the strange sea around me, sending ripples through my bones.

The stage begins to warp, melting beneath my feet, shifting with each blow of criticism. My work, clutched to my chest, starts to blister and bleed ink, smearing my palms with indelible patterns—maps of insecurity I can no longer conceal. The audience leans closer, their faces blurring together into a vast, single, watchful eye that peers straight into me, unblinking and immense.

Panic claws at my chest. My voice, when I try for defense, comes out as a thin silken thread—fragile, wavering—barely audible above the storm of jeers. My secrets now echo in the voices of those I once trusted, twisting into accusations. I feel myself shrinking, shrinking, until the pages I grip are larger than my entire body, and the spotlight is a prison of white heat.

Yet, as the punishment and humiliation reach their fever pitch, something curious stirs in the deepest well of my fear—a flicker, at first, then the faintest glow. With nothing left to lose, I press my ink-stained hands against the stage, and from the prints, wild, luminous vines begin to unfurl. They snake across the floor, curl up the legs of the critics, climb into the cavernous dark.

In the dream, I realize: I can’t stop their eyes or their words, but I can let my roots find purchase here, too. The vulnerability that made me a target now blooms riotously—flowers, strange and beautiful, sprout from all the places I most wanted to hide. Their petals carry my story whether the crowd sneers or listens.

The critics begin to soften, their voices fading into the hush that comes right before a first, uncertain applause. The spotlight cools and pools around me not as a heat-lamp interrogation but as a gentle lake of morning sun. I remain, battered but radiant, no longer shrinking but growing—tangled in my own wild, impossible garden.
