I am dreaming. …are standing on the roof of a half-toppled city hall, wind ripping banners into bright streamers of cloth and sparks from downed power lines drifting around you like fireflies. Sirens coil through the night air in competing keys—ambulance, police, marine rescue—each one a color inside your mind: crimson, cobalt, sickly chartreuse. 

Below, the harbor is ablaze. Cargo ships gnash against each other like iron leviathans, flame-clawed waves slapping their hulls. Beyond them, the hurricane’s black eye turns slowly, a cosmic pupil regarding the shoreline it’s carved into ruin. Yet overhead the sky is uncannily clear, scattering so many unfamiliar constellations you’re convinced the disaster has unstitched the heavens and sewn on a stranger’s night.

A battered satellite phone vibrates in your palm. The mayor barks that every helicopter must evacuate dignitaries from the flooded arts district—“optics first.” Seconds later the governor crackles through a second channel, demanding all rotorcraft be diverted to the children’s hospital perched above a landslide of glowing mud. In your ear, both voices overlap: contradictory chords in an impossible symphony. 

“Copy,” you say to both of them, though you copy neither. You slap duct tape over the speaker, muting their duel, and raise binoculars coated in ash. On an interchange below, fire crews grind their trucks forward through knee-deep water, tires hissing like serpents. Their headlights paint tilted office towers whose reflective façades now catch only the flicker of flames, mirroring the inferno as if the whole city were burning twice.

A surge of vertigo swells; the roof tilts, or perhaps the earth itself yawns. You anchor one boot on a fractured gargoyle, feel rubble shift beneath the sole. An aftershock ripples outward—subtle, seismic, almost a sigh—and the remaining windows of the cinema district collapse in a tinkling waterfall. The distant sound is beautiful, like a crystal percussion section playing for nobody.

Out of the darkness, a drone swoops in—an insectoid silhouette, rotors wobbling. Its spotlight dazzles you, turning every floating ember into a golden snowstorm. Through its tiny speaker, a paramedic shouts: “We have seventy surviving passengers from the commuter ferry, but the pier’s gone. Orders?”

You pull a salvage map from your coat, edges smeared with soot and rainwater. Streets have become rivers; parking garages are makeshift arks. With a marker you carve a new route, funneling rescue boats down an alley once famous for food trucks and jazz. You imagine horns blaring triumphantly as they glide through what used to be a pedestrian plaza—but the jazz is long drowned.

Your radios crackle yet again. A senator insists all fuel reserves be guarded for “critical assets.” A councilwoman demands they power shelters instead. You feel their words collide inside your skull like tectonic plates: order disintegrates into raw noise. Above the cacophony, a child’s voice suddenly breaks through—patched from a scout team. “Commander, the school’s basement is filling fast. We can’t break the door.” Her sentence ends with a gulp of water and static.

That single syllable—Commander—leans into your chest like an iron fist and you realize authority has become an illusion, a hat caught in the maelstrom. Nonetheless you nod to invisible watchers, stamp your foot like a conductor summoning the downbeat, and bark instructions in a voice you barely recognize as your own:

“Diversion Two: clear a corridor along the subway trench. Use flare buoys every twenty meters. Copter crews: med-lift children first, then ferry survivors to the stadium triage. Engineers: reroute portable generators—priority is oxygen pumps and field lights. And someone shut off the politicians’ frequencies until sunrise.”

For an instant all radios fall silent, as if the entire city draws a single breath. Then, like lava finding new cracks, activity explodes—yes-sirs, roger-wilcos, engines revving, rotor blades thundering. From this rooftop pulpit you watch rescue teams spark into motion, tiny pockets of order blooming against the rolling chaos.

The storm’s wall returns, thick with electric bruise-colored clouds. Lightning forks sideways, illuminating skyscrapers sprouting vines of burning debris. Yet among the ruins a slender bridge of searchlights stitches the harbor to the stadium, guiding helicopters like moths toward safety. You sense the disaster’s rhythm slow, the orchestra finding a minor key but, for now, staying in tune.

Then you wake—heart punching ribs like a fist on a locked door—still tasting the salt of stormwater on your tongue, still hearing the small voice calling “Commander.” The echo lingers, half plea, half promise, urging you to rise, to move, to salvage hope from whatever daylight remains.
