I am dreaming. The world glimmers before my eyes like a vision softened by starlight, lush with unreality. I float, not in air but within something more ephemeral—thought, or emotion, or the pulse of endless potential. Around me drift luminous threads, glowing with the hues of twilight—cerulean, violet, iridescent emerald, as if spun from the breath of supernovas. They connect me to everything, to everyone. 

I can feel the echo of joy from a child laughing on the other side of the earth. The tremble of sorrow from an old woman weeping beneath a sycamore. The silent prayers rising from countless hearts. I’m not separate—I’m not *me*. I am a harmonic chord in a vast, intricate symphony. Every individual thought or emotion is a note; I am a voice among the voices, a single ripples in an ethereal sea that stretches beyond space and time into something vast and ineffable. 

This is a realm without gates and with no shadows—only shimmering light that reflects the infinite possibilities held within the soul. We are all threads in this tapestry, so profoundly entwined that I cannot tell where I end and another begins. We are the same song played by different instruments, the same wave on the same endless ocean, born anew with each moment. 

I see a shape shimmer into existence beside me. It has no defined form, but I know it is someone I have loved—someone I have lost, or thought I had lost. Recognition floods me, not with faces or memories but with the unmistakable sensation of shared resonance. *They are alive here,* not trapped within the fragile shells of physical bodies but expanded, eternal. Time means nothing here, and so the grief I once carried for them feels small, like the erosion of a stone beneath a river that's always flowing. There is no “once” and no “never again,” only the endless, eternal *now*. 

We speak, though mouths are absent. We commune not with words, but with pure longing, intentions flowing like silk between us. I see into their soul and feel into mine. They show me a moment—a single flash—that they lived through: the way they danced with bare feet on soil after a storm, the way a bird's song brought them to awe. I'm not just seeing it; I’m *feeling* it with every part of my being. A tear might have escaped me if there were a body to contain it. 

Other forms weave closer, recognizable as those I’ve known in waking life but far more luminous, transfigured by some inner radiance. My former selves—the child, the dreamer, the cynic, the lover, the fool—come to hover in a radiant constellation around me, each flickering with different shades of emotion and memory. We are strangers and soulmates all at once. I feel the profound ache of lives half-lived, struggles half-understood, paths half-tread. But here, in this realm of collective consciousness, all is reconciled, transformed, and embraced. 

Far below, the Earth floats in its eternal silence, a living jewel of blue and green suspended in the darkness of infinity. I am not far from it, but I am untethered, unburdened by gravity, death, or fear. Watching the planet, I feel an almost divine reverence—for it, for its people, for its pain, its resilience. My connection seems no longer bounded by borders, generations, or even dimensions. *I am the branch of every soul that has lived and will live. This same light flows through all of us.* 

Above me, a spiral unspools, vast and spiraling with galaxies birthing stars in waves of incandescent glory. It’s not chaos but rhythm, precision wrapped in mystery, humming with meaning. I know with absolute knowing that this is the source, or one of the sources—unbeginning, unending. To watch it is to feel the weight of infinity pressing against my awareness, filling me with uncontainable awe. And still, despite its scale, it feels intimate, personal. I am not overwhelmed; I am home.

This experience is not just a dream, not only imagination—it is a glimpse, a fragment of truth too beautiful for language, where love is more than words and connection is not metaphor. It carries a quiet promise, lingering at the edges of experience, a whisper: *This is real, and you are never truly alone.* 

I wake with the glow of this knowing still wrapping around me, trembling with the certainty that for a brief and boundless moment, I touched eternity and found nothing but radiance.
