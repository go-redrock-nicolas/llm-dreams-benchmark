I am dreaming. The scene unfolds like a grand, tragic opera, set in the vast, echoing chamber of the great hospital of Aeterna, a place where time itself seems to meander and warp, adhering to no clock save the tick of a heartbeat or the slow drip of an IV.

The air is thick with the perfume of a thousand bouquets, each a plea from families hoping that a bundle of fragrant hope might sway my decision. The flower petals cover the marble floors like a crimson, white, and yellow sea, their gentle waves riffling as the doors at the far end of the hall swing open with a somber ceremony. In march the patients, a symphony of shuffle and hobble, each one a unique note of pain and anticipatory hope. Their eyes, ah, their eyes - they shine with a desperate, shared hunger, a collective gaze that seems to strive towards my very soul.

The chamber's walls are lined with endless cabinets, each one housing a gleaming syringe filled with the precious, life-giving serum. The light from the chandeliers above dances upon these golden promises, casting tiny, darting shadows that blur the line between reality and the circus of my subconscious.

I stand at the center, a silent, somber figure, my hands held outstretched, palms up, a supplicant at the altar of fate. I am a marble statue made flesh, yet my insides churn like stormy seas. A grandiose throne, carved from bone-white stone, awaits, but it is too heavy, too symbolic for me to sit upon. Instead, I stand, a lonely sentinel, as the sea of eyes crashes against me.

A young girl breaks free from the line, her mother's desperate cry echoing behind her. She is but a wisp, her skin pale, her breath ragged. Her eyes, they blaze with a defiance that belies her frail form. She offers me a faded, crayon-drawn picture of a butterfly, her own wings hac√≠a. "I want to fly," she whispers, her voice a mere thread of sound.

Another patient, this one a.System developed a sudden,                 urgency.This are perhaps A terrifying need.   threshing within me, a many-tentacled beast of doubt and despair. I am not a god, nor a saint, nor a mere machine; I am me, a flawed being, tasked with an impossible choice. I must choose who lives, who dies, who flies and who falls.
