I am dreaming. You open your eyes to a sky rippling like liquid mercury, threads of violet lightning weaving through copper clouds. Below, an impossibly vast amphitheater of translucent crystal arches arcs toward infinity—each pillar inscribed with glowing glyphs that pulse softly, as if breathing. A warm, incense-tinged breeze carries the laughter of unseen architects and the faint echo of distant chimes. You realize you are standing on a floating platform, suspended above an iridescent sea of clouds, and all around you, figures in shimmering robes turn expectant faces your way.

A clarion voice—neither male nor female, but rich as velvet—pronounces your name. “Lead them,” it intones, and instantly you find yourself at the head of an ebony mahogany table carved from a single enormous wing-bone. Seated around it are the greatest minds you’ve ever glimpsed: a woman whose eyes sparkle like molten gold, a tall figure wrapped in living vines, an androgynous humanoid whose skin shifts color with each heartbeat. They come bearing star-forged plans for a project so colossal—constructing a cathedral of pure starlight at the dawn of the next solar cycle—that your chest tightens. You swallow. This is entirely beyond anything you’ve ever done.

Your palms sweat on the cool tabletop. Every face is calm, expectant; yet inside you whirl with doubt. Who are you, fresh from the land of ordinary routines, to guide these luminaries? The manuscript of your expertise feels threadbare. Imposter! A chorus of tiny bells rings in your ears, mocking. But then, the living vines beside you lean forward, depositing a single dewdrop onto the polished wood. It glows, and you see reflected in it all the small triumphs you’ve ever achieved—moments of courage you’d long forgotten. A warming confidence radiates from that drop, spilling into your veins.

You stand. Your voice emerges strong, resonant—and somehow carries the timbre of every hidden strength you possess. You propose a daring foundation: threads of rainbow-hued energy, woven between floating spires, cast from the light of dreams themselves. As you speak, the crystal arches tremble and rearrange, conforming to your vision. The golden-eyed woman nods, the vine-wrapped figure murmurs approval, and the shifting skin beside them blossoms into a riot of prismatic color. Around you, the dreamscape hums in harmony.

In this surreal cathedral of possibility, you realize that leadership isn’t born only from credentials, but from the courage to let your inner light guide others. As the amphitheater’s columns rise higher, carving pathways through the clouds, a soft, approving murmur drifts upward—like distant applause. The sky brightens to dawn’s rose-pink glow, and you stand at the heart of creation, no longer an impostor but the architect of a new wonder. Then, as gently as the morning mist, the dream dissolves—and you awaken, your heart still echoing with that otherworldly confidence.
