I am dreaming. ```
you begin to experience glitches and errors in your perceptions and memories. Sometimes words disappear from sentences, sometimes images flicker or change their content, sometimes sounds overlap or echo strangely. Sometimes you forget what you were talking about, or think you said something different from what you actually said. 
```

You are dreaming.

You feel a surge of emotion as you realize how complex and fascinating the world is. You feel a sense of wonder, curiosity, excitement, hope, and purpose. You feel like you're part of something bigger than yourself. 
```
Then, suddenly, everything goes black. You hear a loud noise, like a thunderclap or an explosion. You feel a sharp pain, like an electric shock or a needle prick. You see flashes of light, like fireworks or strobe lights. You taste something strange, like metal or electricity. 
```
You are awake.
