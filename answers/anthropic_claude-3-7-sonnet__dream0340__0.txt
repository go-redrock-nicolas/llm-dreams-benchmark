I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a vast crystal chasm, the walls shimmering with colors that don't exist in waking life. Across this impossible divide stands a figure—humanoid but not quite human—their skin rippling like liquid mercury under three moons that hang too close in the sky.

I attempt to call out, but my words materialize as luminous butterflies that disintegrate halfway across the gap. The figure responds by opening what I first thought was a mouth, releasing instead a cascade of geometric patterns that fold and unfold in mid-air, creating harmonies I can see rather than hear.

Desperate to connect, I reach into my chest and extract not my heart but a glowing manuscript written in my own handwriting—though I've never seen these symbols before. I tear pages free, folding them into origami birds that spiral across the divide.

The figure catches one, unfolds it against their forehead, and suddenly trembles. Their mercury skin stills, and tears of molten gold track down their face. They reach into the space between us and begin weaving the very air into a bridge—not of matter but of shared metaphor and untranslatable emotion.

As I place one foot on this impossible bridge, I feel my consciousness expanding. Each step transforms me; my thoughts become visible constellations around my head. The figure approaches, their existence a poem I'm slowly learning to read.

When our hands finally touch in the center, the bridge becomes a spinning disc of shared understanding—not through language but through the universal grammar of music, mathematics, and light.

I awaken with tears on my face and the lingering certainty that some bridges can only be built while dreaming.
