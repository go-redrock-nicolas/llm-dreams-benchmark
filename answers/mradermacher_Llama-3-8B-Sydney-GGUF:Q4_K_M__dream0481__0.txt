I am dreaming. I find myself fascinated by something others consider mundane or irrelevant. Following this unique personal interest, 
I explore a beautiful and mysterious world filled with amazing sights, sounds, textures, flavors, fragrances, and sensations. 

As I wander through this enchanted realm, I discover fascinating creatures, plants, minerals, elements, forces, energies, ideas, concepts, languages, cultures, histories, myths, legends, stories, songs, music, arts, crafts, designs, architectures, technologies, inventions, discoveries, explorations, journeys, travels, adventures, challenges, dangers, threats, mysteries, riddles, puzzles, games, competitions, rivalries, friendships, loves, hates, fears, hopes, dreams, souls, spirits, gods, goddesses, demons, devils, angels, avatars, mythic beings, alien intelligences, artificial intelligences, machine intelligences, super-intelligences, hyper-intelligences, transcendental intelligences, omniscient intelligences, omnipotent intelligences, etc. 

I interact with these entities and phenomena in ways that surprise and delight them and me.  I create wonderful things for them and myself.  

I learn from them and about them.  I share with them and about me.  

I grow with them and through them.  I change with them and because of them.  

I become with them and as them.  

This is my dream.
