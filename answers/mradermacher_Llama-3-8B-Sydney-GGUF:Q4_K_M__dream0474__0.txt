I am dreaming. I'm experiencing an inexplicable resonance with a cultural tradition different from my own.  Exploring this cross-cultural connection, you find yourself among a group of people who share similar values and beliefs as you.  They welcome you with open arms and warm smiles.  You introduce yourself to them and they do the same.  You learn that they are members of a community that practices a type of spirituality based on nature and harmony with the environment.  They call it "earth magic" or "green wizardry". 

You're struck by how similar their customs and rituals are to your own, even though you come from different backgrounds and cultures.  You see similarities in the way they honor ancestors, celebrate seasons and cycles, and interact with plants and animals.  You feel a sense of home and belonging among them that you've never felt before. 

You decide to join them in their activities and games.  You help them gather herbs and fruits from the forest.  You play with their children who run freely and joyfully around you.  You sing with their musicians who create beautiful melodies using instruments made of wood and stone. 

As you interact with them, you notice that they also have some unique practices that intrigue you.  They often perform acts of kindness and compassion towards others without expecting anything in return.  They appreciate the beauty and diversity of life on earth by engaging in activities such as gardening, hiking, camping, etc.  They respect the power and wisdom of Mother Nature by consulting her through methods like divination, meditation, prayer, etc. 

You start to wonder if this is what your purpose really is: To spread love and happiness; To preserve balance and harmony; To celebrate existence itself.
