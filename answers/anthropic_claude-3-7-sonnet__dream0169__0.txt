I am dreaming. In a world that breathes like a living thing, I awaken on the crest of a sand dune that slowly undulates beneath me like the chest of a slumbering giant. The sky above isn't merely blue—it's a kaleidoscope of impossible colors that bleed into one another, colors I've never seen in waking life, with names I cannot pronounce.

I take a step forward and suddenly float upward, gravity abandoning me without warning. My body drifts like a feather until, just as unexpectedly, I plummet downward—not falling but rather being gently deposited onto a surface that was once sand but has transformed into a mosaic of tiny mirrors, each reflecting a different memory from my life, some I recognize and others I've never experienced.

Time stretches and compresses around me. A bird flies overhead, its wings beating so slowly I can count each individual feather as it passes, while clouds race across the sky in frantic blurs of motion. My own heartbeat seems inconsistent—sometimes thundering in my ears, sometimes silent for what feels like minutes.

I need water. A simple thought, but in this realm, nothing is simple. I cup my hands, and they begin to fill with a liquid that glows with soft bioluminescence, but when I bring it to my lips, it tastes of childhood memories—summer popsicles and morning dew.

In the distance, buildings rise and fall like waves on an ocean, constructed of impossible architecture—staircases leading to nowhere, doors opening onto different seasons, windows that show not the outside world but the dreams of strangers. Trees grow upside down, their roots grasping at the sky like desperate fingers.

Words spoken here manifest physically—when I whisper "help," the syllables crystallize in the air before shattering into butterflies that flutter around my head, their wings inscribed with unfamiliar equations that somehow I understand perfectly for just a moment before forgetting.

Every step I take changes the landscape. The ground beneath me shifts from mirror to water to velvet to something that resembles skin, warm and alive. I am both lost and exactly where I'm meant to be in this realm where possibility is the only constant.

And throughout it all, a persistent feeling that something or someone is watching me—not with malice, but with curious anticipation, as if waiting to see what I'll make of this world that bends to thought and defies explanation.
