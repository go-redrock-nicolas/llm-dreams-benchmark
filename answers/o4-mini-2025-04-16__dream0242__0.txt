I am dreaming. You awake inside the humming bowels of a vast reactor hall, its walls stitched with glowing coolant pipes like veins pulsing with cesium-blue light. Above you, a lattice of chromium trusses trembles as warnings cascade across every dashboard. The air tastes metallic, charged with ozone, and every footstep echoes against massive graphite blocks.  

A high-pitched whine surges to a howl as the outer containment dome fractures, hairline fissures spidering outward. The lights flicker, then give way entirely, leaving you bathed in the reactor’s eerie inner glow—the molten core itself now glimpsed through a yawning breach in the steel barrier. Streams of incandescent fuel droplets drip into an acrid pool below, each one sizzling into steam that hisses like a serpent’s breath.  

You race toward the control console, fingertips skidding over touchscreens that flicker between green “STABLE” icons and fiery red “CRITICAL” alarms. Your heart pounds in rhythm with an unseen siren, and the very ground seems to shudder beneath your boots. The backup injection pumps have seized, gears scorched and frozen. You wrench open a service panel to reveal molten solder oozing from the wiring like wax from a candle.  

A membrane of dread tightens in your chest as the reactor’s pulse accelerates. A disembodied, tinny voice crackles through the PA system—an experimental AI fail-safe you never trusted—whispering, “Containment integrity at twenty-three percent…and falling.” The words reverberate, the last digits stretching into a mournful groan.  

Somewhere behind you, the massive turnstiles that seal off the inner sanctum begin to buckle outward, as if the reactor itself is exhaling a final, terrible breath. You stumble sideways, grabbed by the handle of an emergency coolant valve. Ice-crystal steam rushes out when you wrench it open, forming ghostly plumes that swirl, momentarily masking the glowing core in gossamer vapor.  

For a heartbeat, time slows. You see your reflection in the polished steel of a fractured panel—ashen face, wild hair illuminated by dancing orange embers. You feel the raw heat from the core, a living thing roaring beneath layers of steel and stone.  

Then the ground shivers violently, and a wave of energy pulses out in rippling shockwaves. The reactor hall becomes a choreographed apocalypse of flying rivets, steel beams twisting like ribbons, and coolant torrents turning to steam that billows into the night sky. In that instant, you’re weightless—caught between awe and terror—as the core’s glow fractures into prismatic shards, a dying star trapped in the bowels of earth.  

And just as reality seems about to shatter altogether, a single beam of moonlight pierces the collapsed ceiling, illuminating your outstretched hand on the scorched concrete. You blink—and find yourself staring at your own sleeping form in bed, the red digits on your bedside clock flickering 03:14. A low hum, like the memory of an alarm, drifts across your room as you draw in a trembling breath, the embers of the dream still glowing behind your eyelids.
