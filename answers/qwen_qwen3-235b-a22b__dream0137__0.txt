I am dreaming. You awaken in a courtroom carved from the hollowed ribcage of a colossal, slumbering beast. Its bones glow faintly, etched with runes that pulse like arrhythmic heartbeats. The air hums with the static of a thousand whispered bribes, their voices slithering through the chamber like smoke. Outside the arched windows—windows that open onto a sky of liquid mercury—you glimpse shadowy figures riding winged serpents, their eyes burning with the cold fire of ultimatums. They circle endlessly, a vortex of power and menace, while below, the trial unfolds like a macabre opera.  

The defendant is a marble statue of a man, his face perpetually melting and reforming, each iteration more grotesque than the last: a politician with a crown of dollar bills, a CEO with a spine of barbed wire, a priest with serpents coiled where intestines should be. The prosecution is a chorus of faceless entities whose voices crackle like live wires, projecting holograms of atrocities—rivers of ink bleeding into drinking water, children’s laughter morphing into the clatter of machine guns, a planet choking under a shroud of gold-leafed smog.  

The jury is composed of extinct creatures: a dodo scribbling notes with its wing, a thylacine growling softly at the evidence, a dodo-sized moth whose wings shimmer with the weight of forgotten truths. They glance at you, the judge, with eyes that hold the patience of epochs. Your bench is a throne of frozen lightning, its edges sharp enough to slice through lies. When you shift, the room trembles, as if the architecture itself fears your verdict.  

The threats escalate. A storm of origami scythes slices through the courtroom, dissolving into ash before they reach you. A child’s music box materializes on your desk, its lullaby laced with subsonic warnings of assassination. The marble defendant begins to bleed black sap, which pools into a mirror showing your family bound in chains of light. You feel the weight of a thousand invisible hands pressing on your shoulders, urging you to adjourn, to delay, to *look the other way*.  

But you rise.  

Your robe unravels into a flock of starlings, each bird clutching a scroll of testimony in its beak. The gavel in your hand ignites, becoming a shard of the sun’s core. You slam it down, and the sound is a supernova. The courtroom shatters into a kaleidoscope of realms: a forest where trees whisper verdicts in dead languages, a desert where each grain of sand is a sealed contract of betrayal, a cathedral built from the ribs of the corrupt.  

The defendant’s final form emerges—a writhing mass of crowns, oil derricks, and human teeth. You pronounce the sentence, and your voice is the voice of tectonic plates grinding justice into the earth’s crust. The mass implodes, screaming in every frequency of greed ever uttered. The storm outside collapses; the winged serpents dissolve into rain.  

As the dream fractures, you see the world reborn. Rivers run clear, their waters singing lullabies. The sky fills with birds made of light, stitching the atmosphere back together. And you, judge, are no longer human: your skin is parchment, your veins glowing ink, your breath the sigh of a thousand courtrooms yet to exist. The dream ends not with waking, but with a question: *What happens next?*  

And the answer is a gavel, falling endlessly, echoing through the bones of the universe.
