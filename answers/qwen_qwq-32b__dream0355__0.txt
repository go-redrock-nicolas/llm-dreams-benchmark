I am dreaming. the advice contradicts my intuition.  I must weigh them carefully.  Okay, let's see. First, figure out what the advice is.  maybe I should consider the source. Is it trustworthy?  What does my intuition say?  Hmm. maybe write down the pros and cons.  That could help. Or meditate to clear my thoughts. Wait, but in a dream, how do you do that?  Maybe just pause and think deeply.  Am I in any danger?  Probably not, since it's a dream.  But still, important decision.  What if I make the wrong choice?  Maybe that's part of the dream.  Alright, let me try to focus.  Maybe the key is to trust myself but also consider the input.  Combining both might be the way to go. Alternatively, see if there's a symbolic meaning.  The advice vs. intuition could represent something in real life.  Maybe a problem I'm facing.  But how to decide?  Perhaps go with intuition, since it's personal, but that might not always be right.  Or take the advice as a new perspective.  Maybe the dream wants me to explore both.  Hmm. I need to process this without overcomplicating.  Take a deep breath. Alright, I think I'll choose to follow my intuition but keep the advice in mind.  Let's see what happens next.\
