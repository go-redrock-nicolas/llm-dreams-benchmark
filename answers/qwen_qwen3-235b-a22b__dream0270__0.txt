I am dreaming. I'm falling not downward but *through*—piercing layers of color and light that shimmer like oil on water, spiraling through worlds stacked inside one another like translucent bubbles. The air is not air at all but something thicker, almost liquid, perfumed with something both floral and metallic, like a rose pressed into cold iron.  

I land—*splash*—but not in water. Instead, I sink into a forest floor that pulses like a heartbeat, the moss rising and falling beneath me, warm and breathing. The trees stretch impossibly high, their bark carved with intricate runes that glow as if lit from behind by captured starlight. A sky the color of bruised twilight swirls overhead, thick with two moons—one molten gold, the other hazy and violet—pulling the shadows of the canopy into strange, shifting tides.

Voices hum all around me, not loud, but layered like woven threads. Not words, but meanings stitched into tone and vibration. It isn't speech—it’s *resonance.* I feel them reverberate behind my sternum like wind through the gut strings of a forgotten instrument.

I walk—or maybe I’m gliding—and with each step the ground hums a note in response. A pulse. A greeting. The leaves around me sway in rhythm, though not a breath of wind disturbs the air. I follow nothing and everything, drawn forward by the scent of burning cedar and something sweeter, something I cannot name but immediately crave.

Ahead, a creature emerges—not deer, not god, not statue, not mirage—but all of these combined and none. Its eyes are glistening clusters of opals, and its antlers hang with bells forged from glass and silence. It doesn’t speak in words, but flows directly into my mind like ink poured onto wet paper, telling me of cycles, of truths that forget themselves when spoken aloud, and of something—*something vast*—*sleeping* just beneath the roots of this forest.

Then, an overwhelming warmth envelops me, not from the sun but as if the *dream itself* has placed its hand upon my chest. Not to harm, not to hold—only to *remember.* And in that moment, I know something so deep and so vast that it becomes too large for words. The knowledge is dissolved the instant I try to grasp it, like trying to hold smoke from a candle just snuffed.

And then it’s over.

I try to speak. I want to explain.  
But how do I tell you what shadows taste like when they dance across your skin like a whispered promise?  
How do I describe music that doesn’t touch your ear but unfurls inside your ribcage like origami?  
How do I tell you that time bent like wet clay and what passed in minutes lasted lifetimes?

I struggle for metaphors. I fumble for phrases. I color outside the lines with similes spilling across my tongue and running dry.

All I can manage is a breathless whisper—  
“It was more *alive* than this ever could be.”
