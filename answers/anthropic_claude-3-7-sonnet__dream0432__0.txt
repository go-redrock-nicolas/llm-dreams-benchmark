I am dreaming. The forest breathes around me—ancient and impossibly vast. I stand barefoot where no human has trod for centuries, feeling moss cushion each step with extraordinary sensitivity. The air shimmers with particles that might be pollen, might be stardust, catching sunlight that filters through a canopy so high above it seems like another world. 

Strange, though—despite this overwhelming abundance, an inexplicable thirst grips me. My water flask hangs heavy at my side, sloshing audibly with each step, yet I'm convinced no water exists for miles. Rivers appear between trees, their surfaces glittering with invitation, but I hurry past them, certain they're mirages.

A melodic humming draws me forward. I follow it to a clearing where an elderly woman sits cross-legged beside a spring bubbling with water so clear it appears luminescent. Shelves of moss-covered stone surround her, laden with thousands of glass vials containing what looks like liquid light in different colors.

"You come seeking what you already possess," she says without looking up. Her fingers, impossibly nimble for their apparent age, weave patterns in the air that leave iridescent trails.

I try to speak, but discover my voice translates to ribbons of color unfurling from my mouth.

"Perception is reality's costume," she continues. "Look."

She passes her hand over the spring, and suddenly I'm viewing scenes from my life—moments of overlooked abundance, connections refused, opportunities unseen because I was focused elsewhere, convinced of scarcity.

The forest floor beneath me begins to liquefy, becoming a mirror in which I see myself not as I am but as I could be—surrounded by possibilities as numerous as stars...

I wake with tears on my face, the sense of the forest's vastness still expanding in my chest, and a profound understanding that remains just beyond the edge of words.
