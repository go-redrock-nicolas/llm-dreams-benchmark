I am dreaming. I awaken to find myself in an ancient, ornate teakwood house, the sweet scent of frangipani and sandalwood filling the air. Colorful temple garlands of marigolds and jasmine adorn every altar and doorway. The walls are painted a vibrant turquoise, and intricate Mandalas are painted in elegant gold lacquer. 

Confused but curious, I step outside into a lush, tropical courtyard garden. Exotic birds with emerald and sapphire plumes flit among waterfalls and koi ponds surrounded by Assam tea bushes, teak trees, and orchids. A voices calls to me and I follow it deeper into the gardens.

I arrive at a smaller living quarters where an elder seems to be expecting me.

"Ahh, my child! Observe, you're finally here." I look at her inquisitively as I take in the colorful Kobra print saree gurgling with silver thread.

"We have been waiting for you," she smiles warmly. "You are now part of our adoptive family. Welcome my child. Give me a moment. I wish to introduce you. May I?" she paused.

"With a wave of her hand, an altar is revealed revealing a picture of a young girl dressed in traditional clothing from another era of the universe. The girl was radiant, serene, and serene in the picture beautifully captured."

This is your sister Tanisha. She passed to the next realm before your arrival. Know she is watching over you, there when you need her most. Under my wing, you will learn the ways of our people and family. The Gods are woven through the tapestry of our soul."

The elder woman put her hand on my shoulder. "My child, it is your time to fly as my own. Allow us, the forces of light an the ancestors to guide you."

With that, I awaken, still reveling in the swirling colors and sounds, and the glow of a new beginning ignited, under a bright, fantastical moon and stars.
