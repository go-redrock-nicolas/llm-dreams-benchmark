I am dreaming.

I grip the yoke, knuckles paling beneath the cockpit’s kaleidoscopic warning lights. The aircraft—usually a calm, obedient titan—now shudders beneath my fingers as warnings klaxon and gauges spin wildly, their calm circles suddenly betraying chaos. Outside, clouds boil copper and indigo, and the horizon tumbles away: an impossible mural backlit by a sun that flickers, half-real.

The passengers—a collection of faces, some familiar, others smudged by dream logic—sense the shift. Their voices rumble through the floor in anxious waves, muffled yet urgent. The systems panel throws angry, malignant shadows, each flicker another system gone: hydraulics whine in protest, engines cough, autopilot crashes from digital certainty into silence.

But in the deepest well of dream courage, a strange calm flowers. Time dilates and thickens. Every second glows gold. My hands move in strange choreography, flicking ancient, muscle-memory switches and tracing cryptic runes across blinking screens. I hear my old flight instructor’s voice: “Trust the air. Trust yourself.” 

With radio dead and altitude dropping, I scan the infinite tapestry below: a river shaped like a sleeping dragon, canyons yawning like the mouths of gods, a sunlit meadow promising impossible softness. I conjure up years of training—every storm, every near-miss, every midnight simulator session. I reach for backup power; I rewrite systems with imagination’s logic, rerouting life through wires that shouldn’t connect but do, here, where the dreaming mind reigns.

The plane responds, groaning, yet obedient. Through cracked glass, I see a herd of silver deer galloping across the treetops, their hooves sketching ripples in the clouds. The passengers hush, sensing the shift, and in that shimmering hush, I coax the stricken craft lower, lower.

We break the cloud cover; the impossible meadow blooms below, awash in wildlight and poppies the size of parachutes. The wheels kiss the grass, and we coast to a stop amid a sprinkle of dew and moonlight. The danger melts away, replaced by cheers, tears, and the sweet music of relief.

I step from the cockpit, and the dream dissolves in a chorus of grateful, surreal applause—a pilot who, against every odd, spun disaster into a wondrous, gentle landing, guided not by machines, but by the wild, boundless hope that only dreams supply.
