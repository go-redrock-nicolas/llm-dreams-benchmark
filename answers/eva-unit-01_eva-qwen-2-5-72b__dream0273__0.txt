I am dreaming. The scene opens on a shadowy forest, gnarled trees intertwined with pulsating veins of cobalt light. The lines between reality and imagination blur as the cobalt pulsates rapidly, growing in intensity. An odd radiance begins to emanate from the forest floor, and suddenly, ethereal figures emerge from the neon glow.

The graceful beings approach you with gentle smiles, their voices echoing the hum of the universe. They extend an invitation, beckoning you to leave behind the toxic constraints of earthly expectations and join them in a realm untethered by human pressures.

As you accept their invitation and take their hands, warmth spills into your chestâ€”a feeling of deep connection to the living cosmos. Your human form dissolves, leaving only pure awareness behind, soaring together with the luminous entities through galaxies of love and unity, far beyond the confines of the waking world.
