I am dreaming. …float through a half–lit landscape that seems knitted together from memory, wish, and starlight.  
The sky is not quite black; it shimmers like indigo velvet shot through with tiny silver threads, and whenever you breathe it ripples—almost as if the heavens respond to the rise and fall of your lungs.

You find yourself standing on the terrace of an impossibly tall library. Shelves spiral upward in helix-like towers, each book the hue of some feeling you’ve tried to master: crimson for urgency, cobalt for calm, jade for envy, gold for triumph. A warm wind flips pages, and every turning leaf whispers a single word: “More… more… more…” The sound is so gentle you don’t at first realize it is the voice that has driven you for years.

When you step forward, the marble tiles liquefy into a mirror-smooth lake. The library dissolves, replaced by water the color of moonstone. You’re barefoot now, skimming across the surface without sinking, and your reflection below is multiplied—hundreds of you, each wearing a different expression of effort: one biting her lip in concentration, another rubbing an aching neck, another scribbling endless to-do lists on invisible parchment.

Then, from the horizon, a giant measuring stick rises like a monolith. Numbers climb far beyond any human scale, kilometers instead of centimeters, impossibly precise hash marks etched in silver. You feel your heart pick up tempo—have you grown enough? Achieved enough? You glide closer, almost pulled by magnetic need to prove yourself.

But before your fingertips touch cold metal, the stick bends—like a reed—not snapping, only bowing until it forms an archway. Through that arch glows a garden suffused with dawn colors. You step inside, and the air smells of cut grass, rain-cooled stone, and the faint sweetness of ripe figs.

There is a figure waiting on a moss-covered bench. She looks uncannily like you, yet older and astonishingly serene. Her hair is threaded with silver starlight and wildflower petals; her eyes seem deep as wells that have never known drought. She pat-pats the spot beside her. “You have carried an atlas on your shoulders,” she says, voice rustling like turning pages. “Shall we see what happens if you set it down?”

You feel the imagined weight you’ve worn for decades—the weight of being flawless, indispensable, invulnerable—slide from your back with a sigh. It lands at your feet not as an atlas but as a cluster of soap bubbles. They drift upward, prismatic, then burst with soft pops. Laughter—your own, somehow freer—fills the space where burden used to be.

Around you, vines spiral upward, weaving a living hammock between two flowering trees. The older-you gestures. “Lie here. Let things grow without pruning them to perfection.” When you settle into the leafy sling, the vines curl like comforting arms. Above, clouds let down ladders made of silvery thread. Tiny versions of your successes—paintings, love letters, half-finished poems, forgiving conversations—climb the ladders into the sky. Each time a ladder vanishes into cloud, a gentle rain of golden confetti follows, dusting your skin with cool sparks.

The older-you touches your wrist. “Expectations are like constellations,” she murmurs. “They guide, but if you try to live inside the pattern, you’ll never taste the space between the stars.” She presses a seed the size of a pulse into your palm. “Plant kinder standards. They bloom into possibilities you can actually hold.”

You push the seed into the soft garden earth. Instantly a sapling sprouts, its bark smooth as gratitude, its leaves shaped like little open hands. They clap in a wind scented with cinnamon and sea salt. The tree bends, offering fruit—round, pale-rose orbs that pulse faintly with light. You bite into one. The flavor is exactly the taste of a good deep breath.

The dream begins to peel away like morning fog. The measuring stick has become a ribbon you can tie loosely around your wrist, a reminder rather than a restraint. The library re-forms far away, now inviting rather than imposing. The sky brightens to lavender dawn.

As you feel waking consciousness approach, the older-you whispers: “Aim high, yes—but allow yourself to land softly.” Her voice becomes birdsong. You open your eyes in the real world, pillow warm beneath your cheek, heart lighter, standards gentler—ready to strive not for perfection, but for wholeness.
