I am dreaming.

A deep velvet darkness fills the space around me, but there is a warmth—like the hush inside a velvet theater moments before the curtain parts. The air hums with anticipation. Out of the dimness, a beam of golden light stretches down onto a familiar stage: rough, scuffed floorboards, the faint scent of chalk dust, and the echo of laughter from a memory.

I recognize this place instantly. Before me stretches a grand piano, its polished ebony gleaming under the harsh, revealing spotlight. The audience is somewhere out there, just beyond the blinding glare, but their silent, almost palpable presence presses against my skin. In the waking world, this was where I faltered. My fingers had fumbled, a discordant note shrieked, and a hundred pairs of eyes saw my failure blossom in real time.

Now, a strange serenity fills my chest—a slow, deliberate heartbeat. I glance down at my hands. My fingers, previously clumsy and cold, are steady and warm as the rising sun. The keys practically shimmer, each one waiting, inviting a different facet of my spirit to come alive. I hear the first note before I touch it, as if the music emanates from the air itself, a delicate thread pulling me forward.

As I move to sit behind the piano, the world shifts. The auditorium is suddenly lush with fantastical colors: sapphire and emerald banners flutter from the balcony, golden motes descend like fairy dust. The faceless crowd has morphed into a swirling sea of mythic creatures—lions with wise eyes, singing birds with emerald feathers, beings with wings and antlers and endless patience. Some smile in encouragement, others sway softly to a music that's just beginning—one I am to bring forth from silence.

With a breath, I place my hands on the keys. The past—awkward, embarrassing, heavy—melts away. There is only this magical present, where anything is possible. As I play, music pours from me, not just melodies but entire landscapes—wide fields of wildflowers, star-flecked skies, rivers of pure light. Notes burst, firework-bright, and drift into the hushed air, weaving warmth, courage, and forgiveness.

The nerves I had felt are replaced by freedom—a weightlessness, as if I could float up and join the colors above. The audience listens, rapt, their eyes reflecting new hopes sparked by my second chance. I sense the power to rewrite the moment, to make it beautiful, to leave the memory cleansed and shining.

And in this dream, as the final note resonates into the hush, the applause is not just sound but a tangible, golden wave that lifts me, cradling me in a symphony of acceptance and self-forgiveness. Here, within the boundless creativity of dreaming, I have faced the pain of failure, transformed it, and blossomed into something infinitely more.
