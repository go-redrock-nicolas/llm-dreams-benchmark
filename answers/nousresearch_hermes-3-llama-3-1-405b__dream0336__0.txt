I am dreaming. I feel as if I am being transported to another world.  The air is thick with magic and strangeness.

My senses come alive with unfamiliarity and wonder as I take in my surroundings.  I am in a vast, dense forest.  Unearthly beings are all around me, their forms morphing and shifting.  Nothing stays the same for long here.  Everything is mutable.

Before me is a path.  This path glows with an ethereal light, winding its way into the unknown realms of my mind. Though I do not recognize this place, I know I must walk this path.

As I take the first step, I feel a great surge of energy rising up from the ground and coursing through my body.  I am suddenly hyper-aware of myself.  Memories flash through my mind of moments past when decisions that I made had lasting implications for myself and others. I notice patterns and how they were influenced by hidden biases. I see how these biases have led to difficult situations and learn from them.  The energy within me grows stronger.

Continuing to move forward, I notice that each step feels lighter than the one before.  I am releasing these mental limitations.  With every step, I shed the layers of my biases that were lurking in my subconscious, shaping my thoughts, and coloring my actions.  

The path becomes luminous. I feel light as air.  My vision becomes sharper. I see with a clarity I've never known before. My perception is expanding.  I am free to discern what truly is, devoid of the illusion from unconscious influences I used to hold.

This new awareness permeates my entire being. My mind is clear. I have more understanding and empathy. I have learned and grown. The unconscious biases I once held are no longer a part of me. They disperse like seeds in the wind, never to return.

As the dream fades, I carry this wisdom with me into my waking life. 

Now that I am aware of these biases, I can actively work on eliminating them. I will see people for who they truly are, without judgment or prejudice. I will be better able to navigate the world with fairness and integrity. My decisions will be based on reality, not biases.

This dream has provided me with powerful insight.  I am thankful for the guidance of my unconscious mind, and I will strive to be a better person.  My journey continues.
