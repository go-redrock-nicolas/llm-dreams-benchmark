I am dreaming.

The world around me shimmers with a soft, golden haze—as if the sun is not just rising, but breathing warmth through every blade of grass, every ripple of air. I find myself standing at the edge of a forgotten train yard, tracks gently swallowed by emerald moss and wildflowers bursting through the gravel like pastel flames. Rusted boxcars and faded signal lights sleep in the morning hush, most people passing by with no more than a glance, dismissing this relic as an eyesore. But to me, there is a quiet, haunting beauty permeating every abandoned curve.

Drawn forward by an ache I cannot name, I notice how the dew on a battered locomotive door glistens like scattered diamonds. Vines curl delicately along weathered metal, weaving intricate green filigree atop the faded paint. I trace the warm, metallic surface with my fingers, the texture gritty yet inviting. The air hums with the faint memory of music—perhaps the distant clink of metal or a lingering echo of laughter, dreams once carried away by the trains that now slumber.

Eyes lingering on a single blue flower growing defiantly from a cracked tie, I feel a surge of awe. Why does this blossom dare to bloom here, with no audience but the silent hulks of iron? I kneel beside it, marveling at its fragile perfection, the velvety petals quivering in the gentle breeze. Its existence seems almost miraculous—a quiet rebellion against decay, a secret celebration of life where others saw only loss.

Carried forward by this wonder, I begin to follow the train tracks as they curve away from the yard, sunlight dappling my path. Each step reveals overlooked treasures: a prism of oil on a puddle, swirling with impossible colors; the shadowplay of dandelion clocks caught in the rails; the delicate lattice made by a spider beneath the carriage, holding dewdrops like captured stars.

As I walk, I feel my heart expanding with gratitude for these unnoticed fragments of splendor. Here, in the forgotten corners overlooked by hurried lives, beauty radiates quietly, completely, waiting to astonish anyone willing to truly see. In my dream, I am not alone—around me, colors grow brighter, the song of the world swells, and I am lifted by an invisible current, buoyed by the hidden loveliness that shapes all things and connects me, at last, to a world trembling with unseen wonder.
