I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, you find yourself standing in an expansive, misty meadow adrift with communal feelings of nostalgia and trepidation. As the ethereal fog clears, you see yourself as a child, playing innocently in a sandbox shaped like a maze. You approach this younger version of yourself and crouch down beside her, observing her fabricated world through your adult eyes.

As you watch, you begin to notice patterns in her play. She meticulously builds towers with the sand, only to knock them down again, repeating this process over and over. It's as if she's trying to prove to herself that she can create something beautiful, yet it will inevitably crumble. You realize this is a reflection of the unconscious belief she formed during her early years: that good things don't last, and happiness is fleeting.

Suddenly, the scene shifts, and you find yourself in a dimly lit classroom. The younger you sits at a desk, her head bowed as the teacher towering over her. Words of criticism reverberate through the room. "You're not good enough," the teacher says, her voice dripping with disappointment. "You'll never amount to anything." Your heart aches as you watch young you internalize these words, realizing they're absorbing them like a dark, toxic elixir, imbuing her subconscious with the belief that she doesn't deserve success or love.

The dream takes yet another turn, and you find yourself standing before a large, ornate mirror. Your reflection stares back at you, but it's not you anymore - it's a stranger. This stranger looks at you with pity, as if she knows all the secret shame you carry within you, but also carries a knowing smile, as if to reassure you that it doesn't matter now.

As you continue to observe, the reflection steps out of the mirror and stands before you. She begins to recite a series of affirmations into your ears, her voice warm and reassuring: "I am deserving of love, happiness, and success. My past does not define me. I have the power to rewrite my story."

 suddenly, a tender warmth grows in your chest. You feel a profound sense of compassion for the child you once were, and an overwhelming love for the adult you have become. The stranger in the mirror takes your hand, and together, you walk towards the window behind you. As you gaze out, you see a beautiful, verdant landscape stretching out before you - representing the life you truly want and, just then, deserve.

With a smile, the stranger says: "Reclaim your power. Rewrite your story. You, my dear, are worthy of it all."

As you open your eyes, the vibrant colors and emotions from the dream linger with you, and you're already beginning to see your life and the world around you through a new lens - one infused with possibility, love, and hope.
