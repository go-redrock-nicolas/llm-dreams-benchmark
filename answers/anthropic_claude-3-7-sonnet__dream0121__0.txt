I am dreaming. I'm standing on the marble steps of the Grand Institution, a colossal structure of glass and stone that seems to shift and breathe in the morning light. The announcement still echoes in my ears - somehow, I've been chosen as Director despite my unconventional background. The official letter in my trembling hands bears a wax seal that catches the sunlight, throwing rainbow fragments across my vision.

As I enter the grand hall for my first day, the whispers follow me like persistent shadows. Distinguished academics with decades of experience peer over gold-rimmed spectacles, their faces masks of polite disdain. "A mistake," someone murmurs. "What could the Board possibly be thinking?" hisses another. Their credentials hang invisibly around them like armor I cannot hope to match.

The boardroom awaits me - twelve faces arranged around a table of ancient oak that seems to hold the weight of centuries of tradition. Dr. Harrington, silver-haired and sharp-eyed, doesn't bother hiding her contempt. "Perhaps you could enlighten us about your... unique qualifications?" The question hangs in the air like poison.

I open my mouth to respond, but suddenly notice the walls are slowly melting, revealing strange constellations behind them. The skeptical faces begin to transform - Dr. Harrington's features now flow like watercolor, her words becoming musical notes that float visibly through the air. The ceiling peels away to reveal an impossible sky of purple and emerald swirls.

I realize I know exactly why I'm here, though the knowledge comes from somewhere beyond thought. My fingers leave trails of light as I move them through the air, drawing connections no one else can see...

The dream shifts, growing both more vivid and more impossible with each passing moment...
