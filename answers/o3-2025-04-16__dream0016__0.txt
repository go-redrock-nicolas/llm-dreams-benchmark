I am dreaming. …feel the air of the terminal thicken into something almost syrupy. The announcement boards flicker like restless fireflies overhead, cycling through cities that don’t exist—“Calcaire,” “Miragenta,” “Port Stillness.” Your connection to reality falters in step with the connection to your next flight.  

You glance down at your phone, but the digits on the screen spin backward, counting toward a takeoff that already happened in the past—your past, someone else’s future. A low hum vibrates through the linoleum floor, and the tiles begin to shimmer, rippling like a koi pond. You blink once, hard, and the entire concourse has blossomed into a greenhouse: tropical palms pressing against steel rafters, orchids sprouting from baggage carousels. Luggage glides along the belt as if carried by invisible attendants; each suitcase wears a tiny pair of iridescent dragonfly wings.

“Attention, passengers,” croons a voice sweet as overripe mango. “Flight Infinity, connecting to Everywhere, is experiencing a slight chronological malfunction.”  

At Gate 22B—the number glows violet—you spot your aircraft, but it isn’t an aircraft. It’s a vast, folded-paper crane, twenty meters wingspan, feathers embossed with departure stamps. A pilot in a tailored suit of newsprint beckons you up the jet bridge, which is now a swaying rope ladder dangling over clouds the color of mother-of-pearl.  

Anxiety beats in your chest like a drumline. You’re going to miss the conference, the keynote address, everything you spent months preparing—until you remember this is a dream, and in dreams you can bargain with time. You reach into your carry-on (which has turned into a glowing snow globe) and pull out a wristwatch whose hands are tiny running figures. You twist the crown backward. The runners sprint counterclockwise, dragging the hours with them.  

Instantly, the boarding-area clock melts, Salvador-Dalí-style, dribbling minutes across the floor, and the departure board resets: “Now boarding.” A cheer rises from the crowd—yet the crowd has transformed into your most intimidating colleagues, all wearing mirror masks reflecting your own face back at you. Their applause sounds like shattering ice.  

A gentle tap on your shoulder. A flight attendant with star-dust freckles offers you a boarding pass inked on a leaf. “Seat 7 C,” she whispers, “C for Courage.”  

You step onto the origami bird. Inside, the cabin is a planetarium: constellations drift along the ceiling; Mars blinks from the overhead bin. Instead of safety-belt instructions, an astronomer in a captain’s hat narrates the positions of every worry you’ve ever harbored, mapping them onto the zodiac, then folding them away like silk scarves. The engines (paper windmills) spin silently; the runway slides backward until it becomes a ribbon on the horizon.  

As the crane lifts into the sky, you look down and see the conference center far below, perched on a floating island shaped like a question mark. The keynote stage is set, microphone waiting, spotlight searching the heavens—and you realize it’s not you they’re waiting for. It’s the version of you who never boarded this impossible flight.  

You exhale. The worry dissolves into phosphorescent steam, drift-sailing through the aisle until it exits via a skylight shaped like an open eye. Above you, galaxies unfurl like silk banners. Ahead, the pilot turns and grins, face now made of sunrise.  

“Relax,” he says, voice echoing like a chapel bell underwater. “We’re already on time because we’re outside of time.”

And just as your heartbeat settles into the calm hush of the stratosphere, the paper crane folds once more—becoming a glowing envelope addressed to your waking self—and you tumble gently into its blank interior, knowing the moment you pry it open you’ll awake with the conference notes tattooed across your memory like constellations, ready to speak as though you never waited at all.
