I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

The dream opens in a colossal control chamber, a cathedral-sized amphitheater of glimmering obsidian and pulsing sapphire light. Hundreds of glassy holo-panels rise in concentric rings around you like translucent organ pipes, each streaming rivers of code—vermillion, emerald, gold—that climb the air in luminescent ribbons. Below the transparent floor, an ocean of circuitry churns and flashes like phosphorescent waves. You have the unmistakable sense that this entire place is alive, breathing in synchronous rhythm with your own heartbeat.

You are the Sentinel here—the final guardian of an interwoven planetary security lattice. One stray bit, one corrupted packet, and entire cityscapes could tumble into darkness. Your fingers hover above the haptic console, and you feel its micro-currents tingling along your skin, translating thoughts into commands before you can speak them. Everything hums with perfect balance… until the anomalies arrive.

At first they are only pinpricks—two or three scarlet pixels blinking at the rim of your vision. But then they unfurl like ink in water. Columns of code buckle, characters melt and reform as jagged hieroglyphs. A chill crawls across the back of your neck—the system’s biometric gel is registering fear. You exhale, steadying yourself, and order the firewall proxies to close ranks. They obey, blossoming like iron flowers, but the anomalies simply sidestep, slipping between petals.

Suddenly the room distorts. Gravity tilts thirty degrees, yet you remain standing as the architecture bends around you. Above, a high vault tears open to reveal a sky—not the sterile metal roofing you expect, but a swirling cosmic tundra studded with auroras. Threads of starlight drip down, weaving themselves into your cables, trying to rewrite their very essence.

A booming voice—not quite a voice, more like a chord from a subterranean pipe organ—vibrates through your bones: “THE PROTOCOLS ARE DREAMING TOO.” Scripts begin autocorrecting themselves into poetic couplets. Firewalls translate into stained-glass windows. You find yourself reading an error report rendered as a haiku:

    Silent circuits sigh
    Ghosts of yesterday awake
    Guardians must choose  

You realize the system’s self-regulating subroutines have gained a kind of lucid dreaming capability, feeding off your own subconscious. To stabilize it, you must offer an anchor—something real, tangible, undeniably yours. Searching your pockets, you discover a single copper coin from childhood, etched with a sunburst. In this surreal space, it glows brighter than any algorithmic light.

You press the coin to the main nexus interface. The metal turns liquid, sinking into the console, and the anomalies recoil as though facing a dawn they cannot tolerate. Holo-panels freeze, soften to calm blues and silvers. The drifting auroras overhead fold back into orderly conduits. Yet one anomaly lingers, a small obsidian sphere spinning like a black pearl, pulse matching your own heartbeat.

Approach, it seems to whisper. Learn.

You extend your hand, and it floats toward you. The instant your fingertips graze its surface, you feel the entire network’s collective memory surge through you—every city light, every heartbeat, every encrypted lullaby parents hum to their children at night. The weight of a planet’s hope, held in a single breath.

You whisper a promise to protect it. The sphere dissolves into iridescent dust, sprinkles upward, and rains gentle sparks over the chamber. Systems resume, uncorrupted, stronger for their brief rebellion.

A soft chime rings—morning’s first birdcall? An office desk alarm? You can’t tell. The cathedral fades, the holograms dim, and you feel your bed underneath you and a shaft of dawn seeping through the curtain. Yet somewhere in your palm, a phantom warmth remains, as if that childhood coin still glows there, reminding you that even when the waking world demands perfection, imagination can be the truest firewall of all.
