I am dreaming. I close my eyes and suddenly find myself standing on a tidal plain of liquid moonlight. Each step ripples silver water beneath my feet, sending tiny stars dancing toward the horizon. A low mist coils around my calves, cool against my skin, and in its swirl I catch the scent of night-blooming jasmine. Above me, the sky shifts through bruised purples and emerald greens, as though the entire cosmos were breathing color.

Ahead, barely a hundred paces away, stands someone I trust more than any other—someone whose counsel I’ve always held sacred. Their form is both crystal-clear and oddly refracted, like a sculpture carved from ice that’s halfway melted. As I approach, I sense a tightening in my chest: we’re on the edge of a fierce disagreement. Their eyes—deep pools of opal—narrow when they see me. The moment our gazes lock, the moonlit water shudders, and thunder begins low in my ribs.

They speak, their voice echoing as though it belongs to a chorus. “You’re throwing everything away,” they say, pointing to the path I’ve chosen. In the distance, jagged spires of salt rise from the plain, fracturing the smooth surface. “You’ll regret abandoning reason for whim.” I feel hot defiance flare in me—but also a stab of doubt, because I revere this person’s wisdom.

As tension crackles between us like static, I pause and remember the slow, calm breathing my voice teacher once taught me. I inhale the jasmine-scented air, hold it for three heartbeats, then let it go. The ripples around my feet hush.  

“I need to try it my way,” I say quietly, and the words land in the night air like glowing orbs. My tone is gentle but firm. I speak of hopes I’ve kept secret—even from myself—of a dream path that feels more alive than reason alone can justify.

For a moment, the other’s frozen form softens. The jagged salt spires in the distance begin to melt into wide, gentle dunes of pearlescent sand. Their voice, once a storm, now drifts to me like a breeze. “I may not fully understand,” they admit, “but I see your courage.”

In that instant, the plain of moonlight steadies, the mist lifts, and a shared hush settles between us. We stand together in the glow, not fully aligned but no longer at war—two silhouettes reflected in the calm, star-strewn waters of my own becoming.
