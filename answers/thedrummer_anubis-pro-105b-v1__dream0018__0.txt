I am dreaming. The dream began with me walking through the house, noticing the peeling paint and chipped stone walls that had once stood as a proud testament to the home's long history. Droplets of water dripped from the ceiling, collecting in puddles on the floor as the sound of crumbling drywall filled my ears.

I ascended the creaky stairs, each step groaning beneath my feet as if the house itself was protesting the progress of time. In the attic, I found a paper-thin wall, barely holding its own weight against the howling wind that whistled through its cracks. A sliver of moonlight illuminated a patch of mischief - kudzu vines crawling up the frame, seeking to embrace and devour the place I called home.

With no time to waste, I sought out materials - rummaging through dusty bins and gloomy sheds until I had amassed a collection of mismatched hammers, dented sheets of aluminum, and enough twine to graft an army of dolls. I strapped my belt full of sockets and began the arduous process of reconstruction.

Each beam was polished by my hands, every screw specifically chosen and enumerated. I sawed and drilled, studded with blankets and held together by stubbornness. Bricks were chiseled and sanded until they glistened with the sheen of fresh sweat. The house rose under my hands - stronger, different, yet still home.
