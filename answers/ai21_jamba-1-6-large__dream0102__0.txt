I am dreaming. In the dream, I'm a therapist conducting a session with someone experiencing an emotional breakdown. The person is situated in a dimly lit space filled with a calming lavender scent, sprawled out on the couch with a weighted blanket draped over their legs. They’re clutching a cup of chamomile tea—little puffs of steam waltzing upward like the tendrils of their thoughts.

The room is silent, save for the faint sound of soft piano keys emanating from hidden speakers. The air hums with an unspoken urgency; the client’s breathing quivers like a violin string pulled too tight. I sit across from them in a plush armchair, my legs crossed, the notebook on my lap balanced with the pen poised like a conductor’s baton, waiting to guide the symphony of their emotions.

“Talk to me,” I say in a voice as smooth and deep as melted chocolate. “Let it out, however messy, however jagged. This space is yours.”

They hesitate, their fingers curling and uncurling like the fronds of a fern seeking sunlight. Finally, the crack in the dam forms, and their words spill forth in a torrent. “I feel like I’m drowning. No matter what I do, I can’t catch my breath. The waves just keep coming.” Their hands clench into fists, knuckles whitening as the weight of their despair floods the room.

“Then let’s explore those waves,” I say, leaning forward with a gentleness that invites trust. “What are they made of? Is it guilt, fear, anger, sadness? What are they whispering to you?”

As they speak, I listen not just with my ears, but with every fiber of my being, as if their words are part of an intricate tapestry being woven in real-time. I scribble delicate notes in my book, each line a thread pulling taut against the weight of their sorrow.

I guide them through a grounding exercise, the journaling exercise, visualizing themselves standing on the shore of this emotional ocean. A container around them—safe, sturdy—holds the waves, preventing them from overflowing. I prompt them to name their emotions, to give them colors, textures, sounds. Together, we transform the storm into something tangible, quantifiable—accessible.

The clock ticks softly in the background, measuring the passage of time in heartbeats rather than seconds. Slowly, their breathing becomes steadier, and the storm begins to morph. It’s no longer just a storm, but a rolling tide they can navigate—perhaps not effortlessly, but with resilience they didn’t know they had.

As the session comes to a close, I ask them to consider a talisman for the week—a word, a mantra, a symbol they can carry with them. “How will you anchor yourself,” I ask, “when the storms come again?”

Their response is soft but strong. “Courage,” they say. “Today, I choose courage. Even just for a moment.”

I smile, the warmth of it rising like a campfire in winter. “Courage it is,” I say, and for just a moment, the dim room feels a little brighter.
