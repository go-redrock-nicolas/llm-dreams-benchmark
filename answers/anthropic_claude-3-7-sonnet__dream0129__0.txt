I am dreaming. I enter a healing sanctuary nestled in a valley surrounded by ancient oak trees, their leaves shimmering with golden light. The building itself seems alive, constructed of warm wood and stone that pulses gently with an inner radiance. As I step through the arched doorway, the air shifts—becoming somehow both lighter and more substantial, carrying the faint scent of lavender and cedar.

Inside, a circle of people sits on cushions of deep indigo and emerald, their faces illuminated by floating orbs of soft light. Though strangers, I recognize something familiar in each person—a certain quality in their eyes that mirrors my own, a shared understanding that transcends words. The space between us fills with threads of gossamer connection, visible only when I don't look directly at them.

A woman with silver-streaked hair and kind eyes gestures to an empty cushion in the circle. As I sit, the floor beneath me seems to adjust, cradling me perfectly. The circle leader—whose face somehow shifts between young and old depending on how the light catches it—asks each person to share their most vulnerable experience, the one that still echoes in their dreams.

When my turn arrives, I feel my throat constrict. The words I've kept buried for so long begin to rise, and suddenly the room transforms. The walls become translucent, revealing not the outside world but the landscape of my deepest memory. As I begin to speak, everyone in the circle can see what I see, feel what I felt. My voice emerges differently than I expected—stronger, more resonant—carrying not just pain but also the resilience that lived alongside it.

As my story unfolds in both words and vivid images around us, the others in the circle begin to weep, not from pity but from recognition. Their tears don't fall but float upward, transforming into tiny stars that orbit the room. I realize then that in sharing what I thought would break me, I am instead becoming whole, and somehow helping others find their own wholeness too.
