I am dreaming. The late summer air smells like sunsoaked grass and burning leaves.  A chorus of unseen cicadas pierces the heat-still afternoon.  I walk down a path I’ve never seen before, yet my boots sink into the dirt like it’s the most familiar road in the world.  The trees around me are too tall, their bark peeling in spirals, leaves the size of elephant ears trembling with whispers. 

A silver sedan appears ahead, doors hanging open like maws.  Its paintwork shimmers, reflecting my face back multiplied into a hundred fractured versions.  I approach slowly, fingertips brushing the hood - it’s warm, humming as if just driven.  Inside, the driver’s seat is untouched, a single faded photograph rests on the dash: my childhood home, but the porch railing is replaced by gnarled black ironwork that snakes up the walls like ivy.  

The passenger side door creaks open to reveal a handwritten note, the paper brittle as old skin.  *“Don’t question the way home”* it warns in blocky, bleeding letters.  My pulse quickens as I turn toward the rear view mirror, where my reflection winks back – but its smile morphs into something too wide, too sharp.  The car engine growls to life on its own, headlamps blazing with an inner light that feels accusatory.  I step back… but the path behind me now ends abruptly at a sheer cliff-face, the smell of ozone and wrongness curling off the blackened earth below.  

The car’s passenger window descends with a hiss, revealing a hand offering an envelope sealed with crimson wax.  Inside, a photo of me at age seven, sat within the exact location where my childhood home once stood – but in the image, the house doesn’t exist. Instead, there’s a jagged obsidian monolith where the porch should be. My younger self stands at its base, face pressed against the cold stone, while shadowy figures in hooded cloaks observe from the monolith’s shadow.  

A sound like shattering glass vibrates through the air as the monolith in the photo fractures behind the child-me.  I drop the photo, the car engine roaring louder now, its headlights now pulsating in time with my heartbeat.  The trees lean in closer, their spiraling bark twisting like they’re trying to unravel themselves.  The choice is clear but impossible: climb into the unfamiliar vehicle with ancestors I don’t recognize, or cling to the fading certainty of what I thought I knew – even as the very ground I stand on continues to fray at the edges like loose thread.
