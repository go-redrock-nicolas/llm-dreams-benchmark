I am dreaming. In the stillness of infinite night, I stand before a vast, shimmering expanse of obsidian. The air thrums with electric violet light that pulses like a heartbeat. My reflection in the black mirror-water doesn't show my face but reveals constellations mapping out every choice I've ever made. When I reach to touch my own "future-me," stars burst from the contact, swirling into nebula patterns that shift between ideals and compromises. The ground splits open, and a crystalline bridge emerges, each facet etched with symbols of consequence: one path coils through storms of amber fire, its rocks worn smooth by time's erosion; the other climbs toward a citadel of glass that starts to crumble the moment I step forward. Birds made of ink swoop around me, whispering all possibilities – some in sweet sonatas, others in discordant static. As I lean into the abyss between, my shadow grows wings with gold vein patterns, and it flaps towards the glass, shattering it. I freeze, but the shards refract the light into new constellations. My hands begin to glow with the same violet charge as the horizon, and suddenly I realize: the bridge wasn't between options, but between how I hold them...In this vivid dreamscape, you stand at the precipice of infinite possibilities, where the obsidian lake mirrors not just choices but life’s entire constellation of decisions. The air electrifies with violet pulses that whisper secrets, each one a potential future. Your reflection dissolves into stardust, mapping neural pathways you’ve never consciously traced—— Suddenly, the terrain fractures into two bridges: one carved from crystalline compromise, facets scintillating with symbols of unspoken trade-offs; the other a labyrinth of glass citadels, their spires threatening to collapse under the weight of untouchable ideals.
