I am dreaming.

As I stand on the threshold of the infinite, the air around me is molten with possibility, shimmering as if sunlight dances upon an unseen lake. The world is blank, a fathomless canvas—until I part my lips and let slip the first humming note: a simple, low melody, trembling with anticipation.

With a gentle vibration, the ground beneath my feet blooms. Rolling hills unfurl, their grasses speckled with sapphire-blue flowers that sway in harmony to the rhythm I hum. My song curls upward, and mountains rear their snow-capped heads—impossibly tall and crowned with crystalline citadels that sparkle with the light of a hundred dawns.

I shift my melody—humming now a playful, skipping tune. Laughing rivers appear, threading the hills with ribbons of clear water that catch the sky’s reflection and double it. Willow trees arch over the banks, dripping silvery leaves that tinkle like tiny bells in the gentle breeze. My humming grows bolder, and flocks of birds born from sound alone spiral into the air, painting dazzling patterns above.

Curious, I try a minor key, deep and resonant. With each hushed note, twilight drapes the sky, conjuring stars that swirl and pulse with color—purples, golds, and emeralds unknown to waking sight. Glowing jellyfish drift through the air as if the sky is an ocean, their tendrils trailing effervescent sparks. A luminous moon, impossibly close and lush with green, rises on the horizon, beckoning.

My humming becomes a symphony—layers and echoes, a chorus of myself. Forests thicken, their trunks wide as houses, and in the glades, luminous creatures peek out: foxes with tails of stardust, gentle deer with antlers that grow delicate flowers. All around, life bursts forth in perfect synchrony with my song. Even the stones tremble rhythmically, moss growing in intricate mandalas.

With every breath and note, I realize: these worlds are infinite as the music in me. Awakened to my power, I hum anew—softer, slower, wondering which dream will blossom next, as the horizon expands and the imagination unfurls.
