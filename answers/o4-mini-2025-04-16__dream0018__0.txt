I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

At first, the morning light seeps through your curtains as usual, but when you push open the bedroom door, the hallway catches fire—in slow motion, blue-white flames curling like strange flowers around splintered beams. The whole house groans in protest; from every corner you hear the deep, mournful creak of wood twisting under an unseen weight. The plaster over the living-room wall flakes away in ribbons, revealing a chasm of dark space behind it, as though the house is hollowing itself from within.  

Adrenaline surges. You hover in a realm between dream and waking, heart pounding in your ears so loudly it almost drowns out the house’s own lament. You glance down: your hands are bare, skin chalky from the dust drifting through cracked windows. Tools are nowhere to be found. Even so, you know you must act—this house, your sanctuary, teeters on collapse.  

With limited resources and expertise, you begin to gather everything at hand. A frayed basketball net you’d hung in the garage is unhooked and twisted into a makeshift sling. You tear sheets from your bed to knot them together into a rope. In the kitchen, you stir together flour and sugar—an odd, dream-logic mortar—while lining up chipped porcelain mugs to prop up the sagging floorboard like tiny columns beneath a temple.  

You step gingerly into the living room. The floor valleys under your weight, each footfall sending ripples across the boards as if you walked on water. There, a beam arches downward like the neck of a broken dinosaur. Climbing onto a rickety stepladder, you wedge your makeshift rope against the beam, wrap it thrice around the handle of an old broom, and brace yourself. The world tilts. For a moment, you feel you’ll topple through the floor and into that yawning void behind the plaster, but your grip holds, and the beam lifts fractionally, groaning its gratitude.  

Outside, the wind has risen. It rattles the shattered panes, entering in gusts that tug at your sheets-rope scaffolding. Branches scrape against the walls like skeletal fingers. Undeterred, you break open a wooden dresser drawer: hidden inside are nails, half-bent and scattered. One by one, you drive them deep into the wood with a heavy rock you found in the backyard. You hear each click as a small victory, a heartbeat of hope in the dream’s chaos.  

Above you, the ceiling quivers. Wisps of plaster drift down like ghostly snow. You look up and see the sky faintly through a great rent—an inverted blue lake. For a moment, you’re struck by calm: the world beyond your walls is still boundless, still offering light. That thought steels you.  

You retreat briefly to the foyer, where you rummage through a toolbox inherited from your grandfather—rusty wrenches, a single screw-fixture, a coil of wire. With these, you fashion a tension brace across the largest crack in the foundation, winding the wire tight until the crack seems to breathe less. Each turn of your wrist feels like healing a wound.  

The dream shifts around you. Hallways stretch and contract; the staircase spirals outward like a seashell, but beneath your feet it feels steady now. Step by careful step, you cross the threshold into a bright room at the back of the house—somehow untouched. Golden light pours through an intact window, illuminating a single potted plant that glows with uncanny vitality. You pause, heart thumping, and realize this plant—an ordinary succulent—has rooted itself in the very crack you’d just mended. Its leaves fan out, as if soaking up your efforts and returning them as quiet strength.  

In that doorway, you stand for a moment, surveying your handiwork: the bandaged floors, the propped beams, the patched walls held fast by your ragtag tools. The house, though still bruised, no longer trembles. In the hush, the crackling fires that once bloomed on the walls wink out one by one, and the blood-red sky that peeked through the rafters softens into pale dawn.  

You exhale fully. In the reverberation of your own breath, the dream dissolves, leaving you with one resounding truth: even the most battered structure can be saved by perseverance, ingenuity—and a touch of dream-made magic.
