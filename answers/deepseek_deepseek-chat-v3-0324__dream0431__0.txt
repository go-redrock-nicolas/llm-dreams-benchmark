I am dreaming. The air hums with a golden light, thick as honey and just as slow to move through.  My bare feet press into warm sand that shifts like liquid silk between my toes.  A vast desert stretches before me, dunes rolling like frozen waves under a twilight sky streaked with violet and rose.  

Beneath my collarbone, a dull ache pulses—a phantom weight, the ghost of an old wound.  I press a hand there and my fingers come away glittering with silver dust.  It swirls upward, coalescing into a figure ahead of me: someone familiar, their edges shimmering with unresolved tension.  

The air between us vibrates with unsaid words.  I open my mouth, but instead of speaking, glowing embers drift from my lips, each one a memory—the sharp sting of their betrayal, the heavy silence afterward, the way I folded inward like origami to keep from breaking.  

But the sand beneath us trembles, and something new rises from the desert: slender green shoots unfurling with impossible speed, weaving themselves into a bridge between us.  Tiny blossoms open along its length, each one exhaling a note—not an apology, not an excuse, but simply a quiet release.  

I step forward.  The wound in my chest loosens; silver threads unravel into the wind, no longer anchoring me to the hurt.  For the first time in years, I breathe freely. 

The figure reaches out, and though their fingertips don’t quite touch mine, the space between us hums, alive with the possibility of something softer.  

Around us, the desert sighs, and the dunes begin to bloom.
