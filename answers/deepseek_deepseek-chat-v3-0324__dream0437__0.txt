I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric stillness, thick with the scent of damp earth and something sweetly floral—jasmine, perhaps, or night-blooming cereus. The sky is not black but a deep, bruised violet, streaked with veins of gold like cracks in a celestial egg. Stars pulse slowly, not twinkling but breathing, expanding and contracting in time with my own heartbeat.  

Beneath my bare feet, the ground is neither solid nor liquid—a shifting mosaic of warm, iridescent tiles that ripple like water with each step, revealing glimpses of other worlds beneath their surface: a forest of glass trees, a desert of singing sand, a city built from the bones of forgotten gods.  

A sound—no, a presence—draws my attention. A figure stands at the edge of perception, woven from shadow and starlight. Their face is a shifting tapestry of every expression I’ve ever seen, yet none at all. They extend a hand, and in their palm rests a key made of frozen moonlight.  

But then—something else. A whisper at the periphery, easy to miss: the faintest tremor in the air, the suggestion of a melody just beyond hearing. I realize I’ve been fixated on the figure, the key, the sky, while the dream has been breathing around me all along. The trees (when did they appear?) lean in, their leaves rustling in a language just beyond comprehension. The wind carries voices—not words, but emotions, colors, memories that aren’t mine.  

I widen my focus, and the dream unfolds like a lotus. The figure smiles (or does the sky smile through them?), and the key dissolves into a swarm of fireflies, each one a tiny, glowing doorway. The ground sighs beneath me, and I understand—not with my mind, but with my bones—that every detail is alive, every shadow a story, every silence a question waiting to be heard.  

And then, just as the first note of the hidden melody finally brushes my soul—I wake. Or do I?
