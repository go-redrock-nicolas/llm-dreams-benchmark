I am dreaming. You are floating in a vast marble hall, its walls veined with glowing gold that pulses like a heartbeat. Dozens of hooded figures stand in two perfect lines under an impossibly tall vaulted ceiling, their faces hidden in shadow. Between them, a long obsidian altar stretches toward you, crowned by a single white rose that seems to glow from within. A hush weighs the air. You know this is a solemn rite—a ceremony of remembrance or perhaps of judgment—but the exact purpose drifts just beyond your grasp.  

And then, at the very center of your chest, a spark ignites—a tickling ember of laughter. At first it’s tiny: the ghost of a giggle trapped behind your teeth. But it grows with alarming speed, like a child who’s learned a secret joke and can’t keep it in.  

You press your palms against your temples, willing the laughter to vanish. You bite your lower lip until it bleeds. In the corner of your eye, one of the hooded figures tilts its head, as if aware of your inner struggle. The candles’ flames gutter, and for a moment you think the rose atop the altar pulses in time with your heartbeat.  

The hall seems to close in. The gold veins in the marble walls ripple like liquid honey. A low chant begins to rise around you—soft as distant thunder. You swallow hard. Your throat feels tight, swollen. Each breath is a struggle between the world’s gravity and the absurdity lodged in your ribs.  

You picture the source of your hilarity—an absurd image of a giraffe in a tuxedo, stomping down a runway while a choir of frogs croaks the national anthem. The mental picture catches you off guard. Your chest jolts. A strangled snort escapes.  

Heads turn. The chanting falters. The white rose shivers. You clamp a trembling hand over your mouth. But the more you clamp, the stronger the laughter fights to break free:  
 • Your lips twitch, as if practicing lines for an unseen audience.  
 • Your eyes water, not from grief but from the ridiculousness squirming inside you.  
 • The hooded figures shift their weight, and the echo of their robes rustling is louder than any drum.  

Time warps. A drip of wax from an overhead sconce drops in slow motion, magnified until it’s the size of a marble. You picture it mid-air, gleaming like a tiny planet. The urge to laugh spikes—you imagine the planet cracking open to reveal a tiny clown juggling candles inside.  

One hooded figure steps forward, raising a skeletal hand. “Silence,” it intones, but the voice sounds muffled, as if speaking underwater. You’re certain your giggle could crack that solemn veneer like glass.  

Then, just as you feel you might fold in on yourself from holding it in, the candles all blow out in a single breath. Darkness roars in around you. The white rose’s glow snaps off. Silence thunders.  

And in that perfect stillness, you feel it slip away—the laughter. It dissolves like mist in sunlight, leaving behind a strange emptiness. Your lungs ache from the force of it, but the hall is restored to its mournful calm. The hooded figures lower their heads. The chanting resumes, now softer, more resigned.  

You stand at the altar, hollow-chested and oddly relieved, wondering whether you just committed the greatest transgression of the dream or unveiled its deepest secret. Either way, you know you will never forget how close you came to shattering that solemn world with a single, fragile laugh.
