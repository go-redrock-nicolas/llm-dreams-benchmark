I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the tension of a thousand taut violin strings. You stand in a chamber that isn’t a chamber—a vast, inverted cathedral carved from obsidian and starlight, its ceiling a swirling vortex of galaxies, its floor a mirror reflecting not your face, but the labyrinthine gears of a clock that ticks backward. Here, you are the *Weaver of Threads Unseen*, tasked with stitching the fabric of reality itself. Before you floats the Loom of All-That-Is, a shimmering grid of golden filaments, each strand a life, a star, a secret law of physics. Your fingers, gloved in liquid shadow, must pluck and weave with absolute precision. One misstep, and a star collapses. Two, and a civilization forgets its name.  

But tonight, the Threads rebel.  

They quiver like live wires, hissing in languages older than time. The Loom’s rhythm falters—a stutter in the heartbeat of the universe. You sense it first as a chill in your marrow: variables slipping through the cracks of your control. A storm brews outside this place, a tempest of *wrongness*. Rain falls upward in the distance, pooling into black holes that sip at the edges of the chamber. Shapes writhe in the periphery—inkblots with teeth, entities that hunger for entropy. They are the Unraveled, the consequence of a single miscalculation.  

Your hands move faster, a blur of shadow and intent, but the Threads fight you now. One glows crimson—*a war that should not begin, yet burns anyway*. Another frays at your touch—*a child’s laughter silenced before it can bloom*. You hear whispers in the static between heartbeats: *"You are not precise enough. You are not enough."*  

Above, the vortex-ceiling cracks. A shard of ice-blue light plunges down, embedding itself in the Loom. The filaments snap like guitar strings, each rupture a thunderclap. A planet shatters in the void. A poet goes mad. A door to a forgotten memory slams shut forever.  

You kneel, sweat dripping from your jaw to sizzle on the mirrored floor. The Unraveled close in, their forms dissolving and reforming like smoke caught in a scream. You taste iron—your own blood, a price for staying too long in the Weaving. But you cannot stop. The Loom demands perfection, and perfection is a blade that carves deeper with every breath.  

Then, a Thread glows white-hot. Not a Thread of fate, but of *choice*. It pulses in time with your racing heart. To grasp it is to abandon the Loom, to let the universe unravel itself. To ignore it is to become a ghost in this chamber, forever stitching a tapestry that will one day swallow you whole.  

The storm howls. The Unraveled sing.  

Your hand trembles—  

—and the dream fractures.
