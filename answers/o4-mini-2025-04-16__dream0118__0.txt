I am dreaming. I drift through a silken haze of color—liquidy purples rippling into molten gold—aware that I hold the shape of a proof like a fragile crystal in my palm. Each breath sends sparks skittering across the dreamscape, and as I exhale, the air itself curls into symbols: looping Möbius ribbons, spiraling zetafunctions, and glimmering prime constellations that tumble like stars.

Before me rises a colossal amphitheater carved from white marble, its tiers inscribed with centuries of scribbled theorems. Ghostly figures in togas—Euclid, Riemann, Noether—hover at the edges of the seats, their eyes alight with anticipation. They beckon, and I step down onto the arena floor, where sand of crushed chalk cushions my footsteps. In the center stands a monolithic pillar of black obsidian, its surface etched with a billion infinitesimal cracks, each crack representing an unsolved thread of the proof.

As I explore unconventional approaches to the problem, I lift my hands and the air shimmers into a living tapestry of geometric florets. Each floret unfolds into a miniature world: hypercubes rotating in four dimensions, fractal forests where each leaf is a theorem, and cascading waterfalls of numerical sequences that vanish before they touch the ground. I step into one of those waterfalls and feel the digits dissolve on my tongue—2, 3, 5, 7—resonating like chimes in my mind.

Suddenly the chamber tilts. Gravity loosens its grip and I float upward to a balcony hung with translucent draperies of coded lattice. Behind each curtain lies a different realm of thought: one where calculus is a symphony of strings, another where algebra blooms like coral reefs in an ocean of logic. I slip between threads of possibility, gathering fluorescent filaments of insight—an inner product shimmering with forgotten identities, a new primegenerating pattern etched on the back of my eyelids.

The great black pillar hums. From within its cracks leaks a faint melody—a polyphonic chant of mathematicians past. Entranced, I place my palm against the obsidian. A pulse travels through me, and I see, in a flash, the key: not a conventional proof but a living proof—an infinite dance of structures in which the conclusion is both theorem and hypothesis, forever entwined. The amphitheater trembles as the ghostly audience rises, applauding with silent hands.

But as the final chord of that cosmic chant fades, the marble walls dissolve into clouds of chalk dust. The draperies of lattice evaporate back into code. I plummet, swiftly, through a tunnel of swirling indices, numbers cascading like meteor showers. And just before I awaken, I clutch one last ember of clarity: that the legendary proof was never meant to be pinned down on parchment, but to be lived—an eternal spiral of discovery, each turn revealing new vistas of wonder.
