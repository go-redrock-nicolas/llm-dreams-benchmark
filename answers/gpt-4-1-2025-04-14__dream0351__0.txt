I am dreaming.

The moment my emotional facade shatters, it feels as though the surface of a glass lake has suddenly splintered underfoot. I find myself on a rain-lashed street at midnight, city lights smeared into rivers of color by the downpour. My heartbeat echoes thunder's rhythm, raw and uneven. Neon reflections ripple at my feet, warping as each heavy drop disturbs the oily blackness between cobblestones. People drift past, their faces blurred and indistinct, as if painted in water too hastily.

Suddenly, the wet pavement fractures open. From the crack, swirls of luminous mist rise — a kaleidoscope of memories and bottled emotions I’ve pretended didn't exist. Out pours the chill of old sadness, the sharp ache of anxiety, the whispered shames and hidden fears, all coalescing into luminous butterflies with wings the color of bruised violets and ghostly ice.

I try to gather them, but each touch sends an electric jolt up my arm — a painful relief, like cold air after suffocating heat. The faceless crowd parts. There, at the heart of the chasm, my own reflection stands with outstretched hands, eyes storm-dark yet soft with understanding. The butterflies flutter toward it, dissolving as they reach the mirrored figure, leaving trails of silver in the air.

Sky above rends open, and warm rain washes over me, cleansing, almost forgiving. Light floods through, illuminating the landscape in gold and pale blue, the colors of a peaceful dawn yet to come. The city is silent now, the turmoil hushed, replaced by a gentle hum beneath my skin—a quiet promise: what was hidden can be seen, and what is seen can begin to heal.

I am dreaming, but in this fractured moment, I also begin to wake.
