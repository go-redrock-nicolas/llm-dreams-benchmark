I am dreaming. A golden, translucent curtain sways in a breeze I cannot feel—so delicate it could be spider silk spun by the hands of angels. The world behind it is an enormous tapestry of ordinary things somehow made holy: cracked sidewalks bloom with emerald moss that glows faintly like nightlight; a sagging clothesline hums in the wind like a celestial harp, its socks and shirts fluttering like prayer flags written in forgotten script. Above, the sky is an endless book opened to a page of pale lavender, the color of half-remembered regret, and the clouds drift like ink dissolved in water, soft and twirling without direction.

There’s a silence here that’s not silence at all. It’s a hush sharpened by the song of smallness—pebbles shifting underfoot, a spider’s whispered calculations as she stitches geometry into the air, the scent of rain dreaming itself into being on thirsty pavement. I stoop down to a puddle, and in it, not a mere reflection, but a mirror of something that never was and always is: a city that lives beneath the skin of water, towers made of breath, bridges spun of memory. Fish with wings swim in airless canals, and a child dances on a rooftop not of clay or tile but woven from threadbare starlight.

I see a single glove, abandoned near a curb. But in my dream, it’s not discarded—it is waiting. The glove breathes, fingers curled gently as if holding the shape of something that once fit inside, something tender. I lift it, and warmth floods me. Not heat, but the quivering comfort of reunion, of recalling someone you forgot you had lost. The glove murmurs a name, and the name is not mine—but it belongs to me all the same.

I walk, barefoot now, each step a meeting with the earth. A dandelion clock ticks on the shoulder of a stone. A rusted swing sways empty on its own, as if rocked by invisible laughter. I hear someone humming an old lullaby I never heard but somehow know by heart. My heart beats slower here. The air tastes of honey dust and time suspended.

What others pass by without seeing—they pass by unknowing. But here, in my dream, everything holds secret hands with eternity. The worn button. The crumpled receipt in a ditch. The loose thread on a shirt sleeve. And I am walking through a cathedral not made by hands, but by attention.

And in this sacred, unseen world, I, too, belong—not as a stranger, but as one of its quieting prayers.
