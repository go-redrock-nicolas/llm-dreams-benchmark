I am dreaming. You drift through velvet darkness until a soft lantern glow blossoms at your feet, pulsing like a heartbeat. A silver bridge made of woven starlight arches before you, each filament humming with memory. As you step onto its shifting planks, the air tastes of rain-soaked earth and childhood laughter. Beneath you runs a river of glass—transparent, yet alive with faces that rise and dissolve: your younger self, arms outstretched; the caregiver who soothed you; the one who left.  

With each footfall, the faces ripple, and you feel the tug of your earliest bonds. Behind you, a cloak of mist lifts to reveal a forest of towering paper birches. Their leaves are letters you wrote as a child, each word sealing longing or fear. You pause, reach out, and one leaf drifts down: “Don’t leave me.” The bark trembles, and the forest hums with the echo of that plea. You realize how often, in adulthood, you’ve repeated that silent request—clinging or withdrawing whenever closeness threatened to change.  

Ahead, the bridge dissolves into a circular clearing. At its center stands a crystal fountain, but instead of water it pours childhood snapshots: you learning to walk, tied to a high chair, reaching for warmth. You catch a photo of yourself at seven, perched on the windowsill, watching siblings play. A spike of loneliness pierces your chest—an old friend with you still. And yet, as you touch the image, it crumbles into silver dust and drifts upward, where dozens of glowing motes gather, forming a new constellation shaped like your heart.  

You realize that the patterns you carry—yearning, avoidance, hypervigilance—are not your prison but your compass. They’ve led you, often painfully, toward the place that needed healing. With that recognition, you feel the ground shift. The birch forest returns, but now the letters are unwriting themselves, one by one: “I am enough,” “I am seen,” “I am safe.” The hush in the air becomes a lullaby you wrote for yourself long ago but forgot.  

In the hush, a figure emerges—your adult self, steady and calm, holding a lantern that radiates warm topaz light. She offers you a small key fashioned from moonlight. You take it with trembling fingers and unlock your own ribcage, where a tiny seed pulses. Watered by compassion, it sprouts a vine of silver blooms twisting into an archway. You step through it and find yourself back at the river of glass, but now the faces whisper gratitude and kindness instead of longing.  

You lift your head and see the other bank, lush with impossible flowers—violet petals that pulse with invitation, golden blossoms that hum stability. You know that crossing will require courage and the willingness to trust both yourself and those who have earned it. Yet with the key in your hand and the newfound understanding of your attachment patterns, you feel ready.  

You step again onto the starlit bridge. Each plank glows under your sole, no longer quivering with old fear but steady with awareness. As you move forward, the dreamscape dissolves into silver motes, and you awaken with the knowledge that the deepest bonds can be rewritten—one mindful step at a time.
