I am dreaming. I find myself in a world washed in twilight—a silvery dusk that never quite dwindles to darkness, nor ever brightens to day. All around me, the shapes of others glide, wrapped in flowing robes of iridescent color that shimmer from lavender to seafoam as they move. I am not alone, yet not a word is spoken; the air is thick with meaning, communicated only through movement.

From the center of a spiral garden—petals of moonflowers unfurling around me—I am beckoned by the community’s elder, a tall figure whose limbs spiral in slow arcs, each gesture exuding a warmth and welcome that vibrates in my chest. She approaches, and with every slight tilt of her head, every gentle folding of her hands, I feel waves of understanding: *Trust. Curiosity. Anticipation.*

To connect, I must quiet the restless engine of speech within me, focusing instead on the pulsing beneath my ribs, the subtle shiver in my hands. I begin. I remember hope as a child and let it carry me: a leap and soft landing, toes gently brushing the grass. I remember sorrow—a slow, weighted roll of my shoulders, arms gently crossing my heart. I remember joy—one foot spinning, arms open wide to catch the world. 

Around me, the others echo and answer. Some draw close and mirror my movements with delicate precision, reflecting back a sense of shared feeling. Others drift alongside, crafting their own looping pathways through the midnight garden, their gestures painting arcs of luminous empathy and gentle encouragement.

My emotions bloom like radiant lanterns, their luminescence encoded in sway and pirouette, in the way I drop to my knees and rise up again, in every trembling extension of my fingers. I find that sorrow is lighter when a stranger bends their silhouette to mine, breathing with the same rhythm. I discover that excitement erupts in a rapid cascade of shoulder-shaking swirls the moment I leap, and that the community surges with understanding—neither applause nor silence, but a collective exhale. 

In this place, every heart is visible, every feeling a ripple in the ocean of bodies moving, each creating harmonic forms. The barriers of speech dissolve, replaced by choreography: heartbreak a slow unraveling, forgiveness a gentle circling of wrists, love a fearless dance toward the center.

I am no longer afraid of being misunderstood, for here, truth pulses in each carefully calibrated motion, each shared gesture—a living, wordless language more honest than any I have ever known.
