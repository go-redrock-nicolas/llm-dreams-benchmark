I am dreaming. I'm in a vibrant, thriving building - a bustling skyscraper in the heart of a vibrant city. The glass and steel walls stand tall, stretching high into a bright blue sky. Then, without warning, the ground suddenly lurches violently. The air is split by an deafening roar as the massive earthquake strikes, shaking the very foundations of the tower. Windows shatter, debris rains down, and screams echo through the halls as chaos erupts around me.

In an instant, the solid ground beneath me gives way. I stumble and fall as the building crumbles. Concrete and steel crash down, burying me beneath an avalanche of rubble. Dust and debris choke the air, making each breath a struggle. I try to call out for help, but my voice is muffled by the heavy wreckage pinning me down.

As the dust settles, I hear others around me - a woman sobbing, a man coughing painfully, children crying out for their parents. We are trapped, buried alive in this tomb of twisted metal and concrete. Panic sets in as the survivors realize the gravity of our situation. Without immediate help, we risk being buried forever. The race against time has begun, and our lives hang precariously in the balance.
