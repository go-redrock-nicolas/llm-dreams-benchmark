I am dreaming. I am in the midst of a luminous glade, surrounded by trees that hum with musical notes, their leaves flickering like tiny stars against the cobalt sky. A crystal river serpentines gracefully through the grass, its waters shimmering with hues of opal and turquoise. I approach its banks and peer into the depths, where golden fish dart, each leaping into the air with sparks trailing from their fins.

A soft voice whispers through the air, as though carried by the breeze itself, "Will you follow where the river leads?" Without hesitation, I step onto its surface, the water firm and glistening beneath my feet, and begin to walk. With each step, the landscape transformsâ€”twilight falls, but the sky is painted with the auroras of a thousand twinkling constellations. A warm wind brushes past, carrying wafts of jasmine and cedarwood.

I follow the winding path, feeling an irresistible pull toward the horizon, where the river pours over into an infinite cascade of light. As I near its edge, I see a staircase spiraling down, each step glowing faintly, descending into what seems like another realm. Inhaling deeply, I place my foot upon the first step and let myself be drawn into the shimmering unknown, trusting the journey's call, as the world fades into shades of iridescent mist.

I awaken, my pulse quickening with wonder as the memory of that river lingers, trailing through the air like music heard in another world.
