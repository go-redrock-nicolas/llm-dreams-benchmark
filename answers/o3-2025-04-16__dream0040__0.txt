I am dreaming. …step forward into a stadium that looks as though it’s been dreamed up by constellations themselves. The track is a ribbon of molten silver, still glowing from some celestial forge. Spectators fill the stands in stratified layers: nearest the field sit ordinary humans, but higher rows shimmer with translucent sea-horses, robed owls, and giggling clouds shaped like children. At the very top, constellations lean out of the velvet night, their starry bones clicking with anticipation.

I am the final competitor in the Event of Impossible Motion. It’s equal parts sprint, long-jump, mid-air choreography, and something no waking tongue quite names. My entire life has funneled to this starting line—years of sunrise sprints along quiet beaches, afternoons spent practicing impossible pivot-turns on cliff edges, nights learning to harmonize my heartbeat with distant thunder to steal a fraction of its electricity.

A hush folds over the stadium. Even the satellites above seem to pause in their orbits, as if the whole universe inhales. A golden dragonfly—official messenger of the dream-Olympics—zips to my ear and whispers, “Run until you lift.” Its wings hum like harp strings. The starting gong is not a sound but a burst of color: a bloom of vermilion and aquamarine that sweeps across the sky.

I push off the blocks. Each stride takes me farther than physical logic allows; the silver track stretches and liquefies beneath my feet. With every footfall it sends up sparks that ascend as miniature suns. The first obstacle looms: a wall of air frozen into geometric shapes—octahedrons, dodecahedrons, fractal petals. I leap, twisting between gaps no larger than a sigh, my body gliding through negative space sculpted by pure thought.

On landing, the track tilts skyward into a sheer incline. Gravity releases its claim, and I sprint vertically, soles kissing starlight. The wind here tastes of peppermint and memory. I can hear my mother’s encouragement from childhood echoing inside the gale: “Fly the way you once flew in my arms.” At the peak of the tilt comes the Void Gap—an obsidian slice of nothing, wide as a river of night. The rules say you must cross without touching its edge, or your dream dissolves.

I gather every lesson, every muscle fiber’s memory, and launch. Time dilates. Mid-air I feel the atomic hum of my own blood, see distant galaxies blinking like fireflies. I stretch into a shape that isn’t quite human—limbs unfurl, bones forget their limits, skin flickers with aurora colors. For a suspended eternity I’m neither falling nor flying, just existing as possibility.

Then—the catch of wind under my outstretched fingers, the jolt of velocity reclaimed. I clear the Void Gap, landing on the other side where the track has become a river of glass. The surface is slippery with liquid reflections of my own past selves: the scared kid who first laced up shoes, the stubborn teen who refused to quit, the disciplined adult who sacrificed nights to training. They grin and cheer as I race over their mirrored images.

The final segment is the Ascension Spiral: a helix of opalescent steps coiling into the zenith. Each step drums a note of music, building a song that grows louder as I ascend. With every stride, memories convert to melody: the taste of citrus after practice, the throb of lactic acid, the tears shed in secret. The staircase narrows to a single point where nothing exists but space and the promise of a finish line.

I gather the song into my lungs and let it explode from my throat in a shout. The note fractures the last step, turning it into a burst of dandelion seeds made of light. I leap through them—and there is the ribbon. It glows platinum, suspended in mid-void, held by two beings whose faces swirl with nebulae. I thrust my chest forward, and the ribbon surrenders, wrapping around me like a sash of condensed dawn.

The stadium erupts. Fireworks of liquid chrome spiral upward, becoming butterflies that rain silver petals. The dragonfly messenger returns, settling on my shoulder. “Gold,” it buzzes, voice trembling with delight. The medal drifts down from above as if magnetized to my heart: a sun-disk encasing a tiny hourglass whose sand is starlight. When it touches my skin, I sense every moment of training rewoven into this single weight—light as hope, heavy as destiny.

I look up. Across the arena, my competitors—some human, some dream-beast, some glowing silhouettes—bow with respect. The crowd’s roar paradoxically becomes a lullaby, a sound that cradles instead of deafens. For a breath I’m more than an athlete; I’m a note in the symphony of universal striving, proof that effort itself shapes reality.

Then the dream begins to soften, edges feathering as dawn creeps toward the world beyond sleep. The silver track curls into mist, the stands dissolve into sunrise colors, and the medal melts into a single, radiant heartbeat. I feel myself drifting backward through cottony layers of half-consciousness.

But just before waking, the dragonfly whispers one last secret: “Remember: whatever you did here can be done out there, too—if only you run until you lift.”

I blink, and morning light pours through my window, bright as a stadium’s floodlights. My chest is light, my muscles electric. Though my hands are empty, I swear I can still feel the cool kiss of a sun-disk medal against my skin and the faint hum of a crowd of constellations cheering me on.
