I am dreaming. You awaken inside a cathedral of liquid starlight, its vaulted ceiling swirling with galaxies that pulse in time to your heartbeat. The floor beneath you ripples like ink on water, each step sending silver ripples outward. At the far end of this cosmic nave stand two figures, each illuminated by a different aura. To your left, the Commander of Team Ember is clad in burnished armor that seems to glow from within—each plate etched with runes that flicker like embers in a dying fire. To your right, the Chancellor of Team Frost bears robes of crystalline ice, their hem trailing frost-flowers that shatter into diamond motes as she moves. Both turn toward you, eyes alight with expectation.

The Commander’s voice booms like molten metal poured over stone: “Dreamwalker, the forge of our ambitions cools without your flame. Align with Ember, and this project will pulse with unrivaled energy.” His gauntleted hand extends, offering a small iron key that burns at the edges, so hot you can almost feel its heat through the dream’s haze. Across the aisle the Chancellor answers in a tone smooth as iced glass: “Or stand with Frost, whose clarity will sculpt our work into perfection. Take this crystal chalice—its waters will reveal the path forward.” The chalice rests in her open palm, swirling with a liquid that glitters like a frozen river under moonlight.  

A silence follows, heavy and alive. You sense the cathedral itself leaning in, waiting for your choice. Above you, constellations realign into a colossal scale, one pan weighted by flame-shaped stars, the other by shards of azure ice. You feel the pull of their rivalry in your chest—your own heartbeat echoing the push and pull of molten warmth against crystalline chill. The air tastes of ozone and burning pine; somewhere behind you, a choir of forgotten collaborators hums a fragile harmony, as though the dream itself fears this juncture.  

You take a breath and find that, in this realm, reality is malleable. With a gesture, you paint a line of shimmering silver dust along the cathedral floor, bridging the distance between the two leaders. The key and the chalice rise from their hands, orbiting each other like twin moons caught in a shared gravity. Their auras begin to swirl together—gold and sapphire, fire and frost—until the entire space quivers with possibility. In that moment, you realize the choice is not to abandon one side for the other, but to weave their strengths into something new.  

And so you speak, your voice resonant in the starlit vault: “Let us forge with both flame and frost. Let ember and ice entwine.” Instantly, the runes on the Commander’s armor glow a brilliant sapphire, and frost-flowers bloom along the Chancellor’s robe in warm, glowing patterns. The cathedral’s tiles lock themselves into a chequered mosaic of warm reds and cool blues, humming with collaborative energy. As the two leaders step forward to embrace this unexpected union, you feel yourself drifting upward—free, fulfilled, the architect of a dream where rivalry becomes the spark for creation. The last thing you hear, as the stars applaud in silent thunder, is your own laughter, ringing clear and triumphant.
