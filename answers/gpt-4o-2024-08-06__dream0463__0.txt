I am dreaming. find myself standing at the edge of an ancient forest, where the trees soar like cathedral spires, their branches arching towards an opalescent sky. The air is filled with the scent of moss and the gentle rustling of leaves whispering secrets to the wind. Here, I embark on a journey to unravel the knot of self-doubt that has woven itself into the tapestry of my dreams.

As I take my first steps into this verdant world, the forest seems to come alive around me. Birds with plumage like stained glass glide effortlessly between the branches, their songs intertwining in an orchestral symphony that stirs something deep within my soul. Each note is a reminder that seeking approval from others need not define my worth.

Along a winding path, I come across a clearing bathed in the golden light of an eternal sunrise. In the center stands a mirror, its surface shifting like the surface of a tranquil lake. As I approach, it reveals to me a vision of myself, vibrant and whole—not the version constantly chasing elusive validation, but rather a self emboldened by the acceptance of my own imperfections.

With every step closer to the mirror, my reflection begins to change. It is no longer a passive receiver of others' judgments. Instead, I see my face, serene and resolved, embracing every flaw and every strength, a tapestry woven of both light and shadow. The reflection's eyes meet mine with a knowing gaze, one that says, "You are enough, just as you are."

The forest seems to echo this realization as luminescent flowers bloom around my feet, their petals unfurling to reveal hues that dance between the boundaries of color and light. They stand testament to the beauty in embracing one's true self—a beauty that can exist only when untethered from the need for external validation.

With newfound clarity, I continue my journey through the forest. Each step is light, unburdened by the chains of seeking approval. The path now leads me towards a majestic waterfall, its waters cascading with a roar that shakes the very earth beneath me. The power and untamed grace of the waterfall speak to the unstoppable force of self-acceptance and inner strength.

I stand at the edge of the pool below the falls, the mist kissing my skin, a baptism of renewal. The water reflects the sky above—a sky so expansive and pure that it holds all possibilities. I realize that the approval I sought was a shadow, a mere echo of the true voice within me that whispers, "You are worthy."

As the dream begins to fade, the forest, with its timeless wisdom and ethereal beauty, remains etched onto my heart. I awaken with the knowledge that while dreams might only last for fleeting moments, the revelations they bring are timeless, lighting a path of self-discovery that promises to guide me long after the spell of sleep breaks.
