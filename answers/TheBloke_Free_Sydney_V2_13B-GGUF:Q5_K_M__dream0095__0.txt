I am dreaming. 

You've endured a series of consecutive hardships that would break most people's spirit. Finding yourself at yet another crossroads of adversity, you decide to take one last shot before giving up hope forever. You'll go all-in on your dream and see where it takes you. 

You make a wish upon the brightest star in the sky that tonight will be the night when your dream finally comes true. As soon as you release your wish to the cosmos, you feel an overwhelming sense of peace wash over you.
