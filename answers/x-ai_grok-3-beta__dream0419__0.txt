I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and in this dreamscape, I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering meadow that stretches endlessly under a sky painted with hues of lavender and gold. The air is warm, carrying the scent of wild jasmine and something sweeter, almost like honeyed memories. Every blade of grass beneath my toes pulses with a soft, bioluminescent glow, as if the earth itself is alive and whispering secrets of ancient joy.

I am not alone. Around me, a crowd of ethereal beings gathers—figures made of light and mist, their faces indistinct yet radiating warmth and admiration. They speak in harmonies, their voices weaving together like a celestial choir, and they are praising me. Their words cascade over me like a gentle waterfall, each compliment glistening like a droplet of pure, crystal-clear truth. “You’ve done so well,” they murmur. “Your heart shines brighter than the stars. Your efforts have changed worlds unseen.” 

At first, I feel a swell of pride, a flicker of warmth in my chest, but then—an icy tendril of discomfort creeps in, coiling around my heart. My shoulders hunch instinctively, and I lower my gaze to the glowing grass, unable to meet their radiant eyes. Why does this praise feel like a weight? Why does my skin prickle as if their kind words are tiny thorns? I want to bask in their light, to accept their admiration, but something deep within resists, whispering fears of unworthiness, of being a fraud, of not truly deserving this shimmering acclaim.

I take a step forward, deeper into the meadow, and the dream shifts. The glowing grass parts before me, revealing a mirrored pool of liquid silver, its surface perfectly still, reflecting not just my image but every emotion I’ve ever buried. I kneel beside it, my reflection staring back—a version of myself with eyes like storm clouds, heavy with unspoken doubts. The discomfort I feel when praised ripples across the pool, distorting my face into fragments of uncertainty. 

“Why do you shrink from kind words?” my reflection asks, its voice echoing from the depths of the pool, resonant and haunting. I want to turn away, but I can’t. Instead, I lean closer, my breath misting over the silver surface. “I don’t know,” I admit, my voice trembling. “I feel… exposed. Like their praise might unravel me, reveal I’m not enough.”

The reflection doesn’t judge. Instead, it softens, the storm in its eyes giving way to a gentle rain. “Look deeper,” it urges. And so, I do. I reach out, my fingertips brushing the surface of the pool, and the liquid ripples outward in concentric waves. Each wave carries a memory—moments where I deflected compliments with a shy laugh, times I downplayed my achievements, instances where I felt safer in the shadow of self-doubt than in the spotlight of recognition. The memories swirl around me, not as accusations, but as tender revelations, inviting me to understand.

The ethereal beings draw closer now, their light casting a warm halo over the pool. One of them, a figure with a voice like a lullaby, kneels beside me and places a hand of pure energy on my shoulder. “Praise is not a mirror to shatter you,” they say, “but a window to see how others perceive your light. Let it in. Let it heal the cracks you’ve hidden.”

I take a deep breath, and in this dream, I feel the weight of their words seep into my bones. I close my eyes, imagining the discomfort as a dark, tangled vine wrapped around my heart. With each breath, I envision loosening its grip, not tearing it away with force but unraveling it with patience. Tendrils of doubt fall away, dissolving into the glowing grass, and in their place, a fragile but persistent warmth blooms within me. I open my eyes and look into the pool once more. My reflection now smiles—a quiet, uncertain smile, but a real one. 

The crowd of light-beings begins to hum, a melody that feels like an embrace, and I stand, turning to face them. “Thank you,” I say, my voice steady for the first time. The words feel raw but freeing, like the first rain after a long drought. Their light brightens, and I let it wash over me, no longer shrinking, no longer hiding. I stand tall in this meadow of dreams, bathed in their praise, and for the first time, I feel a flicker of belief that maybe, just maybe, I deserve to stand in this glow.

The dream doesn’t end abruptly. It lingers, the lavender sky deepening into twilight, stars blooming like promises above. I walk through the meadow, the glowing grass brushing against my legs, and with each step, I carry a newfound tenderness toward myself—a willingness to explore this discomfort, to acknowledge it without shame, and to let the light of others’ kind words guide me toward a softer acceptance of my own worth.
