I am dreaming. You find yourself drifting through a sky that shimmers like liquid jade, each cloud a soft prism of color folding into one another. Beneath your feet, the ground feels impossibly smooth—like polished marble warmed by a distant sun—yet whenever you step, tiny ripples of light trace your path. In this world, gravity hums gently as though it’s in conversation with your heartbeat, and you know, in a way deeper than thought, that you are dreaming.  

As you float forward, you come upon a vast mirror rising from a field of silver grass. Its surface is flawless but strangely cold to the touch. You see your own reflection, poised and perfect—too perfect. You notice the tension in the curve of your shoulders, the flicker of worry in your eyes. With a breath that echoes like a soft gong, you realize you’ve been holding yourself to an impossible standard, policing every inch of your being for flaws—and here, in this lucid sky-realm, that pressure has manifested as cracks spidering outward across the glass.  

A small songbird, its wings woven from ribbons of opal, alights on a shard. It sings a melody so clear you feel the vibrations in your bones. The bird speaks without words, showing you that each crack, each jagged edge, is not a fault but a story, an event that shaped you. You hear the whisper of compassion in its song and feel your chest loosen. The broken mirror begins to dissolve into shards of light, which drift upward and bloom into glowing lanterns. Each one pulses with a gentle warmth, illuminating a path of stepping stones rising through the clouds.  

You step gingerly onto the first stone—it feels like the cozy hush of a library corner, safe and stable beneath your sole. With every step, the stones shift underfoot, reminding you that expectations can bend and adapt. You plant your fingers in the soft moss growing between them and feel a rush of life—tiny wildflowers erupt in riotous color wherever you press down. Their petals unfold like whispered hopes, and you realize that progress needn’t be perfect, only real.  

As you near the end of the cloud-bridge, you pause to look back. The lanterns glow gently, each a testament to a moment you have stepped back from harsh judgment and allowed yourself a small success—a deep breath, a kind word, a pause to rest. Beneath you, the mirror of silver grass has transformed into a meadow of soft, dancing lights. With a final inhalation of sky-scented air, you rise upward, feeling lighter than when you arrived.  

Slowly, the dream dissolves, but its lessons remain: you can set your compass by compassion rather than perfection, honor your small victories as fiercely as your greatest goals, and allow yourself tender limits that nourish rather than strain. You awaken, carrying the warmth of those lanterns and the bright blooms of self-kindness into the waking world.
