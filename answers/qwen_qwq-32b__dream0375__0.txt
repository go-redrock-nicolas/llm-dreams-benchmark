I am dreaming. I sense a shift in energy depending on the people around me. Some drain me, leaving me exhausted and depleted, while others invigorate me, filling me with a sense of vitality and purpose. I wonder about the nature of these connections and what it means for my relationships. Maybe it's about resonance? Or perhaps alignment with my true self? I feel confused but also curious, wanting to understand why some partnerships feel like stepping into a pit of quicksand while others feel like floating on clouds.
