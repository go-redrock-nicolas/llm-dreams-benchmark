I am dreaming. You open your eyes, and instead of the comforting darkness of a familiar night sky, you see enormous ribbons of shimmering color dancing across a kaleidoscopic sky. The clouds here are not soft and white but made of glittering, shifting geometric shapes, each fragment refracting alien starlight into prismatic splinters. Beneath you sprawls an otherworldly landscape, a patchwork tapestry of stony crags, glass-like fields, and mountain ranges that seem to defy normal geometry, twisted in bends and spirals that make you dizzy just to look at them.

You quickly realize that the air here holds a strange density, pushing against your lungs in a slow, rhythmic pulse. Each breath feels like you’re parting a shimmering veil. Sounds are distorted, warping in unpredictable echoes and sudden silences. You find yourself curiously weightless, your body reluctant to stay firmly attached to the ground. Every movement demands a certain patience and grace, as if you are swimming in dream-thick water, each step a lilting dance.

You realize you must adapt—this environment follows rules unknown to Earthly physics. The pressing question: how do you survive here?

Your first discovery is that a gentle wave of your hand through the air can gather wisps of swirling light-energy. It tickles your skin like warm static, forming small globe-like shapes that hover and flicker. With a jolt of excitement, you realize these glowing orbs can be coaxed to float in front of you, illuminating your surroundings and guiding you forward. More importantly, you sense that these spheres are brimming with a faint, nourishing power. By concentrating on them and inhaling, their energy seeps into your lungs, rejuvenating you like a breath of fresh Earth air.

The surface beneath your feet is equal parts grit and silky crystal. You notice patches of the surface flicker and pulsate, as if alive. Where you step, it sends out ripples of color that race away into the distance. Sometimes, peculiar creatures follow the outburst of your footprints—serpent-like phantoms made of pure light, slinking gracefully before dissolving back into the iridescent ground.

Soon, you encounter bioluminescent obelisks towering at the edges of an oval-shaped clearing. Their surfaces resemble living quartz, shot through with glowing veins that pulse with the planet’s heartbeat. When you approach, they hum with a deep, resonant tone. You place your palm on one obelisk, and a ripple of warmth surges into your hand. You sense your muscles strengthening, your breath coming easier, as though the obelisk has shared a fragment of this world’s natural power with you.

Beyond the clearing, a river of molten crystal meanders across the terrain, shifting colours from emerald to electric violet. You cautiously step near its banks, where the heat emanating outward is strangely gentle rather than scorching. Thin jets of steam swirl around you and, in a dream-like reveal, you notice that the river seems to run both forward and backward in time. One moment, you see the glimmering flow move steadily downstream; the next, it flows in the opposite direction. You watch fish-like apparitions composed entirely of stardust dart through the shifting current. They slip in and out of the river’s timeline in a graceful loop, reappearing moments before you last saw them, flickering through possible futures.

Realizing the potential danger of this perplexing place, you carefully gather your luminous orbs and dip one into the crystalline waters. A spectrum of color erupts at the point of contact, dancing upward in twisting ribbons that fuse with the orb. As you lift it from the surface, the sphere has grown in size and radiance. Its new swirling patterns pulse with a gentle, rhythmic beat, as though it’s alive with the river’s enigma. Instinct tells you it will be a key source of sustenance and guidance through this surreal world.

Gradually, you become accustomed to gliding steps, drifting lightly across the ground in great arcs. The environment feels as though it’s learning about you, reacting to your presence. Strange ridges in the distance shift and re-form if you stare at them for too long; your vision warps the mountains into chasms, then back again. You suspect that every aspect of this planet is in flux, responding to observation and thought.

Pressing onward, you explore further into the dreamscape, drawn by a gentle glow growing larger on the horizon. It reveals itself to be a vast fountain of shimmering, pastel-hued vapor. Tiny crystal shards dance on the surface, like innumerable stars swirling around the fountain’s spout. Casting your orbs into it, you watch them resonate and merge with the effervescent vapor, intensifying their aura and humming with a soothing resonance. In that moment, the planet feels benevolent, almost protective, and you sense a guiding presence—ancient, wise, and curious about the dreamer who dares to walk its surface.

A gentle hush falls across your surroundings, as though the world is collectively holding its breath. You feel the subtle shift of perception telling you the dream might end soon, and already you mourn leaving behind its surreal wonders. You take one last inhalation of fragrant, luminous air, letting the pulse of this place imprint itself upon your senses. Your entire body vibrates with possibility, your heartbeat now in harmony with the distant cosmic chords echoing across the landscape.

Then, with a gentle lurch, the prismatic clouds, the crystal fields, and the glittering obelisks glide away from you, dissolving into the glowing sphere that once sustained you. A final swirl of dreamlight and color reels back into the corners of your vision, and as you awaken, you can still feel the lingering warmth of that alien planet in your bones—a haunting, beautiful invitation to dream again and return one day, should the cosmos permit.
