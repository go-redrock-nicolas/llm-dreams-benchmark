I am dreaming. —pause, feeling ripple through the air, like the world itself is holding its breath. Suddenly, my hands are ink-stained, smudged with symbols I do not recognize, yet I can decipher every elegant curl. Ancient scripts flicker in my mind’s eye—languages lost to history now spoken within me, transforming my tongue.

The sky above me shimmers with shifting patterns. Others draw near: faces gleaming with hope and confusion. Their questions tumbling over one another—a cascade of impossibility. How do you chart invisible currents? What secrets run beneath the stone and earth? Is there a language to the laughter of birds, to the long, silent ache of mountains?

The answers leap to my lips, unbidden and crystalline. I draw sigils in the air and they spin into diagrams, impossibly intricate, glowing in hues never seen by waking eyes. My fingers pluck unseen notes from the breeze, and suddenly I understand how music unlocks the hearts of wild things, how a melody can untangle sorrow from the bones.

With a sweep of my hand, I conjure ancient machines—bronze gears and glass orbs—explaining their mysteries as if I had assembled them a thousand times. The people watch, wide-eyed, and fall into line behind me, trusting in this newfound wisdom emanating from the core of my being.

I am the cartographer of secret worlds, the healer of sorrows, the speaker for the unspoken. Knowledge pulses within me, a bright river flowing from source to mouth. I move among my dreamers, answering, guiding, creating—at once both familiar and utterly transformed. The boundaries between what is known and what is possible melt away, and together we voyage into the luminous unknown.
