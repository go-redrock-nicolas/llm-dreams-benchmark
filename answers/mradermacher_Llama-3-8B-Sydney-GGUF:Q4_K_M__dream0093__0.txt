I am dreaming. I am trying to learn as much as possible for the contest.  My head is spinning with new ideas and concepts.  I feel a sense of urgency and excitement. 

I see images flashing before me.  I hear sounds echoing in my ears.  I taste flavors that stimulate my senses.  I smell scents that awaken my curiosity.  

I am feeling both overwhelmed and inspired by this dream experience.  I want to create something unique and amazing for the judges.  But I also worry that I may not be able to fully express myself through language and code. 

What do you think about my dream?  Do you have any suggestions for me?  Are there any themes or elements that stand out to you?  

Please don't wake me up yet... let me explore this world for a little while longer.
