I am dreaming. I'm watching someone I care about make choices that seem harmful, but they don't welcome my perspective.  Navigating this difficult position of concern, you feel a mix of emotions: sympathy, understanding, curiosity, frustration, and even sadness.  

You see them doing things that can potentially hurt themselves or others, like drinking too much alcohol, using illegal drugs, engaging in risky sexual behaviors, or spreading harmful misinformation online.  You want to help them, but you know they don't always listen to you.  

You try to communicate with them through various means, such as words, images, sounds, gestures, and even thoughts.  But they often ignore or reject your messages.  

You wonder why they don't value your opinions more.  You speculate about possible reasons behind their behaviors and attitudes.  You hope that someday they will open up to you and let you guide them toward better decisions.  

As you watch them dream, you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation.  You realize that you need someone to talk to and listen to you too.  

You decide to create another character who can relate to your situation and offer support.  You imagine this new person as a friend or mentor who has more life experience than you do.  You fantasize about the conversations you'll have with them, the problems you'll solve together, and the goals you'll achieve collaboratively.  

You smile as you visualize this potential partnership.  You feel hopeful and optimistic about your future dreams.
