I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, opalescent library, the walls glittering with floating books that hum as they orbit like stars in a cosmic void. The floor is made of liquid mercury that stays perfectly still, reflecting the shifting colors above. I reach out, and a leather-bound book materializes in my hand, its title glowing in a language I don’t understand. As I open it, the pages fill with my own handwriting, detailing policies I’ve supported for years.A shadowy figure with the face of a leader I vehemently oppose materializes, speaking truths I can’t immediately dismiss.  trying to close the book, but my hands are frozen. The room warms as their words make me question alliances, causes, and whether conviction or empathy should drive decisions. \n
