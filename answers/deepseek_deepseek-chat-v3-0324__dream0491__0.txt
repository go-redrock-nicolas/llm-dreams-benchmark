I am dreaming. **Dream Sequence: The Beckoning Horizon**  

The air hums with an electric whisper—soft, insistent, drawing me forward like the pull of an unseen tide. My feet press into moist earth, cool and spongy, as though the ground itself breathes beneath me. Above, the sky is a bruised violet, streaked with phosphorescent trails of fading stars. A path winds ahead, bordered by towering reeds with silvered edges, swaying as if murmuring secrets in a language just beyond my grasp.  

A warmth blooms in my chest—not heat, but a golden resonance, a silent chime reverberating through my ribs. *Go,* it says. *Follow.*  

The horizon shimmers, distorting like liquid mercury, and I step toward it. The reeds part, revealing a vast, glass-like lake, its surface still as polished obsidian. Yet beneath—oh, beneath!—shapes move. Shadows of great winged creatures, sinuous and ancient, gliding in slow, hypnotic arcs. Their wings ripple like ink in water, merging and separating in a dance older than memory.  

Then—voices. Not with sound, but with *presence.* They thrum in the air, in my fingertips, in the roots of my teeth, translating directly into knowing: *You are needed elsewhere.*  

A boat, carved from petrified driftwood, waits at the shore. When I step onto its surface, the water wakes—ripples spiral outward, each one flashing with fragmented scenes: a city I've never seen but know intimately, hands I’ve never held but recognize, a door half-open, spilling light into a darkened room.  

The boat glides on its own. The horizon nears, but it is no longer a horizon—it’s a threshold. A great archway of intertwined bone and vine, humming with a low, sonorous vibration. As I pass beneath it, the dream *peels*—  

—and I wake with the unshakable certainty that somewhere, beyond the veil of waking life, the journey has already begun.
