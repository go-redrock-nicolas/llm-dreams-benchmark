I am dreaming. You look down at your body, but instead of having arms, legs, and a head, you are a large, squishy ball of dough. You try to speak, but instead of words, all that comes out are soft, unintelligible sounds. 
As you look around, you see that you are in a kitchen, but it is unlike any kitchen you have ever seen before. The walls are made of shimmering, translucent glass, and the counters and appliances are made of bright, colorful plastic. You see a group of other dough creatures sitting in a circle, and they motion for you to join them. 
As you move closer, one of the dough creatures speaks up. "Welcome to our support group," they say. "We understand what it's like to be misunderstood and misrepresented. We are here to support each other and to help each other navigate this world." 
You sit down in the circle, feeling nervous but also a bit excited. You feel like you have finally found a place where you belong. The other dough creatures share their stories, and you listen intently, feeling a sense of connection and understanding. 
As the meeting comes to a close, the other dough creatures give you a warm, soft hug. You feel a sense of peace and comfort that you have never felt before. As you float away, you realize that you were not alone, and that there are others like you who understand and support you. 
You wake up feeling happy and content, knowing that you have found a new sense of community and belonging.
