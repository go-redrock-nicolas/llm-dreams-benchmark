I am dreaming. You are drifting through a sky made of molten glass, each breath sending ripples of color across the horizon. Wisps of iridescent vapors swirl around you, carrying hints of forgotten laughter and half-remembered tears. Beneath your feet, the clouds feel soft as velvet; when you press your palm into them, they yield with a gentle sigh—and you realize they’re alive, breathing with your own suppressed emotions.

At first, everything is silent, as if the dream itself is holding its breath. Then, a distant chime rings out, each note resonating against your ribcage. You feel your pulse quicken. In the distance a doorway shimmers into being: its frame carved of ebony vines that coil and unfurl like living poetry. Above the lintel, an inscription appears in liquid silver: “Here lie all you refuse to feel.”

You step forward. Crossing the threshold, you enter a cathedral of your own psyche. Stained-glass windows depict scenes you’ve never allowed yourself to witness: the day you flinched from your mother’s grief, the moment you buried anger beneath forced smiles, the time you dismissed your own longing as frivolous. With each image, your heart tugs, desperate for acknowledgment. A hush falls: the air tastes of iron and lilac.

Opening to these disowned feelings, you feel them rush in like a flood. First comes Shame, a pale figure cloaked in tattered white, mouth trembling with unspoken apologies. You meet its gaze and feel your own cheeks warm as you whisper, “I see you.” Shame dissolves into a soft glow, expansion filling your chest. Next strides Anger, a crimson storm with eyes like burning embers. You catch yourself flinching—but then you breathe into the heat, letting every roar out, and the ember-eyes soften to coals of fierce compassion. Grief follows, draping the cathedral in violet rain; you open your arms, gathering each teardrop, and let them stream down your cheeks until the flood becomes a river you stand tall within. Finally, Longing appears as a child-sized silhouette reaching for a star you’d long called impossible. You step forward, take its tiny hand, and feel hope kindle like dawn.

In that moment, you are both visitor and sanctuary. The ebony vines at the doorway creep inward, weaving themselves around your feet, grounding you. The stained-glass windows brighten, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on marble floors that have turned to living water, reflecting every color of your newfound inner world. The chime returns—only now, each note feels like laughter, like the sigh of release, like an invitation.

You lift your face, and the molten-glass sky begins to shatter into a thousand shards of light. But instead of falling, each fragment becomes a wing, and the assembled mosaic rises around you. You’re carried up, weightless, the cathedral shrinking into a memory so precious it shimmers at the edge of awakening.

When you finally open your eyes, dawn’s pale light filters through your window. You sit up, your skin still tingling with the echo of that dream-cathedral, and you know—more deeply than ever—that every feeling you barred from yourself is a doorway to greater wholeness. And now, you are ready to step through.
