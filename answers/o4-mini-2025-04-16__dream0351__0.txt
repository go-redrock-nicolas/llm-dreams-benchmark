I am dreaming. When the last thread of your composed mask snaps, the world around you shatters like a stained-glass cathedral under a hammer. You find yourself standing in an endless hall of translucent ice, each surface holding a mirror-sharp reflection of your face—eyes calm, lips still curved into that practiced smile—while beneath the surface your heart pounds in furious drums. Then, with a single, seismic crack, the ice floor splinters beneath your feet. 

You fall, not into darkness, but into a cascade of liquid color. The walls of the tunnel you slide through swirl in molten emerald and sapphire, streaked with veins of molten gold. Each ribbon of pigment carries a fragment of a memory—a child’s laughter, an argument you never quite resolved, a secret you buried deep. They wrap around your limbs, tug at your hair, and for a moment you feel as though you’re dissolving into those bright, living currents of feeling.

At the bottom of the churning tunnel you emerge into a vast, moonlit forest of towering mushrooms whose caps glow in pulses of violet and pink. The stalks are ribbed like the spines of ancient books, and when you brush your hand against one its pages flutter open, whispering half-remembered truths in a voice that sounds like wind in dry leaves. You realize these fungal tomes are the chronicle of your hidden fears—each page a confession you refused to admit even to yourself.

A sudden breeze carries the scent of rain on hot pavement, and you look up to see cloud-ships drifting overhead, their sails stretched like pale jellyfish wings. From each hull sways a lantern shaped like a beating heart; they dim and brighten in unison, casting a pulsing glow on the forest floor. Drawn by curiosity, you step forward, and the forest floor ripples like water under your boots. Beneath your feet the earth parts, revealing a subterranean cathedral of roots and veins, throbbing with life.

In the heart of that cathedral stands a single marble altar inscribed with your name in letters of living flame. On it rests a crystalline mask—your mask—cracked and trembling. As you reach out, each fissure blooms with tiny stars, and in their light you see all the wounds you’ve hidden, all the rage you’ve swallowed, all the grief you’ve smothered. A tear wells in your eye, catching starlight, and you realize that to wear this mask any longer would be to deny the very things that make you human.

With deliberate gentleness, you lift the mask from the altar. It’s surprisingly warm against your skin, and as you raise it to your face you feel a rush of acceptance so fierce it knocks the breath from your lungs. When you put it on, you don’t become someone new—you become yourself, whole and unguarded. The heart-lanterns above glow brighter still, the mushroom caps pulse in celebration, and the forest exhales in a sigh that rattles every leaf.

Then, in the hush that follows, you hear a single, clear voice—your own—saying at last, “I am here.” And in that moment, the dream forgives you. The ice cracks finally give way, the tunnel of color dissipates into dawn’s first light, and you awaken cradling the newfound music of your own unleashed truth.
