I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself standing at the edge of an immense, otherworldly stage. The wooden floorboards beneath my feet creak with an uncanny rhythm, as if whispering ancient secrets. Here, we are on a stage, but it is unlike any I've seen before. The stage extends far into the darkness, its borders lost to the shadows that dance and flicker around the edges.

I take a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves, but the air in my lungs feels thick and heavy, like breathing through honey. The chrome of the lights overhead casts an eerie green glow over everything, giving the scene an alien cast.

As I look out into the audience, I realize that the seats stretch out endlessly, bathing everything in shadow. I can't see the crowd at the end of the auditorium. But I can feel their eyes upon me, piercing and unblinking, as if I've been placed under a microscope.

The silence is deafening, broken only by the eerie creaking of the stage and the pounding of my own heartbeat.

Suddenly, a figure moves in the shadows to my left. A small woman with hair like spun silver steps out of the darkness. She is dressed in a cloak the color of ravens' wings, festooned with shimmering strings of what look like stars. Her eyes are pools of swirling nebulae, deep and ancient and knowing. She smiles at me, a smile that holds both pity and pity.

"Ready?" she asks, her voice like a whisper on the wind.

I open my mouth to respond, but no sound comes out. I try to shake my head, to tell her that no, I'm not ready. I'm not prepared. I've neglected my training and my studies in the frenzy of this incredible journey. I'm lost.

Her smile widens, stretching grotesquely, her teeth gleaming like steel. Her eyes seem to swirl faster, the colors blurring into a sickening haze.

"Too late now," she whispers, and she's everywhere, behind me, beside me, in front of me. Her breath is on my neck, her whispers in my ear.

"The show must go on..."

I turn to run, but I'm frozen in place, mute as a winter branch.

Suddenly, the silence is shattered by the screech of some unearthly creature. A blinding light fills the auditorium from its unseen edge, and the stage begins to shake violently. The murmuring of the crowd grows to a deafening roar.

And then, with an audible pop, I realize I'm awake. 

I sit up in a cold sweat, heart pounding, disoriented by an incredibly vivid dream.
