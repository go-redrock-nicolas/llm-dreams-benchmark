I am dreaming. I'm seated in a circular amphitheater, the chairs arranged like tree rings around a central speaking platform. The room pulses with an otherworldly blue light that seems to emanate from the very walls, casting everyone's faces in strange, shifting shadows. The air feels dense with unspoken thoughts.

The discussion has been raging for what feels like hours about whether consciousness exists in all living things. The majority argue passionately that awareness is uniquely human—their voices blend together into a symphonic certainty that drowns out all dissent.

I feel knowledge bubbling inside me like hot springs—ancient wisdom that contradicts everything being said. My heart pounds against my ribcage. Each time I try to speak, my throat constricts, and my words dissolve before reaching my lips. The faces around me blur and stretch, growing more imposing with each passing moment.

Suddenly, I notice something strange. With each confident proclamation from the group, tiny luminous threads drift upward from the plants decorating the room, from a butterfly resting on the windowsill, from the wooden table itself. No one else sees these shimmering filaments of awareness.

A warmth spreads through my chest. I stand, and surprisingly, the room distorts—the ceiling soars impossibly high, the other participants suddenly small. My voice, when it finally emerges, sounds like many voices speaking in harmony. Words pour from me about the consciousness that threads through all existence, vibrant examples and forgotten knowledge flowing effortlessly.

As I speak, the blue light intensifies, and the threads of awareness from all living things in the room connect to my outstretched hands, forming a glowing tapestry of interconnected consciousness that everyone can now see.

The dream shifts, and I'm walking through a forest where every tree whispers its ancient stories directly into my understanding, the debate far behind me but its revelation still pulsing through everything around me.
