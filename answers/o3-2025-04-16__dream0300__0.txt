I am dreaming. …feel the world around me begin to shimmer, as though every particle is awake and pulsing with its own heartbeat.

I’m standing barefoot on the lip of an impossible cliff—half cathedral spire, half living creature—jutting above a sea the color of molten sapphire. Far below, the water rises in titanic, slow-motion spirals before collapsing into crystalline foam that rings like wind chimes when it bursts. The cliff’s rock is warm under my toes, breathing in and out like the flank of some sleeping titan. Somewhere inside the stone, a basso heartbeat matches the hammering in my chest.

An obsidian ladder, rungs twisting like vines of night, coils downward toward the water. It sways in a wind that tastes of ozone and wild citrus. The ladder’s gleam both beckons and warns: one slip, and I’ll tumble into that swirling sapphire abyss where the waves crack open to reveal flashes of starlight beneath.

The threat is real enough to quicken my pulse, yet something in me hungers for it. My fingers close around the first rung, shockingly cold, and a jolt of energy snaps up my arms. Each step thrums with danger and delight. I can feel the cliff’s living stone exhale behind me, as though bidding me farewell—or daring me to continue.

Halfway down, the ladder angles beneath a curtain of silver rain that never reaches the water. Droplets freeze into shimmering symbols midair, runes that dissolve when touched, leaving behind scents of pine, salt, and forgotten memories. My hair clings to my skin, sparkling with liquid moonlight.

I peer beneath the ladder’s final rung: the sea has become a mirror, perfectly still. Yet thunder echoes from below its surface, deep and resonant, promising storms within calm. My reflection stares back—only it’s not quite me. The eyes are brighter, ancient, as though I’ve already lived a thousand lives on the climb down.

Before hesitation can claim me, the mirror-sea parts like a curtain. A narrow stone arch rises, draped in constellations, revealing a staircase spiraling into luminous depths. Every instinct screams that this passage is peril made manifest. And still, exhilaration coils tight within my ribs, because crossing that threshold feels like stepping into the marrow of the world.

I inhale—tasting lightning, fear, and fierce joy—and leap. The air catches me like velvet claws. Gravity loosens its grip. I’m falling and floating simultaneously, pirouetting through corridors of liquid light. Phosphorescent manta rays glide alongside, their wings inscribed with maps of forgotten galaxies. One brushes my shoulder; sparks bloom in neon blue, tingling like laughter on my skin.

I land gently on a glassy platform suspended above nothingness. The space around me beats like a colossal heart, each pulse pushing ripples of color through the dark. Here lies the source of the thunder: an enormous crystalline sphere, cracked by silver fissures that drip stardust. It calls to me without words, promising revelation and ruin in the same breath.

My hand lifts of its own accord. The surface of the sphere is cold fire, singing against my fingertips. The crack widens, spilling prismatic winds that braid themselves through my hair. Every fear I’ve ever known flickers in those winds—every triumph, too. I see myself scaling other cliffs, choosing other ladders, leaping into a thousand alternate dawns.

Then, with a sound like a bell tolling underwater, the sphere shatters. Shards whirl around me, each fragment reflecting a facet of my soul: courage dancing with terror, curiosity arm-in-arm with caution. The pieces orbit faster, forming a radiant halo that lifts me upward, back toward the cliff, the sea, the world above.

I breach the surface of the mirror-sea as though soaring through a dream-sky, landing on the cliff’s living ledge where it all began. The rock breathes steady beneath my feet, now in perfect rhythm with my heartbeat. Lightning still tingles in my blood, but the fear has melted into a pure, crackling wonder.

Behind me, the sea closes, the stairway dissolving into indigo calm. Ahead, dawn unfurls in impossible colors, and I realize that the danger was never the fall or the shatter—it was the chance that I would refuse to leap.

I turn my face to the rising sun of this dream-world, heart thrumming with equal parts relief and anticipation, already searching the horizon for the next impossible precipice that will frighten and thrill me into awakening.
