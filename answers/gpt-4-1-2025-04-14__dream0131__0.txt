I am dreaming. —I am dreaming.

Cold water squeezes my body in the ink-black caverns beneath some nameless ocean, deeper than sunlight dares to wander. My breaths thin and ragged, I hear the hiss and click of my failing oxygen tank echo off jagged walls coated with pale, spindly anemones that sway like slow flames in the darkness. The collapse behind me seals any hope of an easy return—the reverberations still vibrating up my spine.

My pulse hammers out a warning, yet through the fear, a strange determination flickers to life. I force myself to focus: the trembling beam of my headlamp sweeps across the flooded stone, catching silvery flecks embedded in the rock—a hidden vein of something ancient and unknown. Just beyond, an impossible shimmer twists the water, bending it into hues I’d never seen on the surface: ultraviolet violets, glimmering greens, a color like the sound of a church bell rung underwater.

I swim deeper, desperate yet drawn forward by the haunting beauty. As the pressure grows, my body feels lighter, my limbs languid as if dreaming inside a dream. Up ahead, the cave cracks wide at the bottom, opening into a cathedral-like chamber where bioluminescent creatures pulse slow rhythms—jellyfish like starbursts, sleeping eels curled like painted ribbons. The air in my tank gives a feeble sputter: **almost gone.**

Still, there in the heart of this sunken sanctuary, a pocket of luminous blue haze moves in the current. I kick weakly toward it, lungs burning, and realize—impossibly—it is a bubble of air. I break through, gasping. The air tastes sweet, tinged with salt and a strange, golden spice. Looking up, the ceiling is glassy black, and tiny lights cluster above me in unfamiliar constellations.

The terror recedes. I feel watched—not by predators, but by the deep. There is music here, a language of bubbles and distant whale moans. I belong to the secret now, tangled in wonder, while the roots of the ocean cradle me, and I float—weightless, awake inside my dream.
