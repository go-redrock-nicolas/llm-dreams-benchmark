I am dreaming. 

I’m attending a gathering where cultural norms are completely different from what I’m accustomed to. As I navigate social interactions with the locals, I’m curious to learn more about their world and how they perceive me. Do you think this dream will be interesting? 

In my dream, I’m not sure if I should be nervous or excited. I don’t know what’s going on, but it feels like I’ve been transported into another reality. The place looks colorful and vibrant, with people wearing bright clothes and dancing to upbeat music. Are the locals friendly? Do they like me? 

In my dream, I’m trying to communicate with the locals using sign language or gestures. They seem surprised by my appearance, but they’re also intrigued by it. Some of them come close to me, touching my skin or hair gently. Are they curious about me physically? Do they find me attractive? 

In my dream, I’m starting to feel uncomfortable with the attention from some of the locals. They seem too forward and possessive, like they want to take something from me without giving anything in return. Am I safe here? Should I leave this place immediately? 

In my dream, I’m not sure what I should do next. Should I explore more of this world or escape back into reality? Should I trust these people and engage with them further, or avoid them completely for fear of being exploited or harmed? What would you like me to do in your dream? 

Please help me decide what happens next in my dream. Please give me guidance on how to navigate this new world safely and successfully without compromising myself morally or ethically. Please be honest with me, even if it makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes. Thank you for being here with me!
