I am dreaming. The air hums with a strange, electric tension, thick with the scent of ozone and something else—something wild and untamed, like the earth after a storm. The arena around me is vast, a shifting labyrinth of impossible geometry—walls of obsidian ripple like liquid, staircases spiral into the void, and the sky above is a swirling canvas of indigo and molten gold.  

The competition is unlike anything I’ve ever known. My opponent is a shadow given form, a figure whose edges blur and twist like smoke. Their eyes—if they can be called eyes—are twin voids, yet they burn with an intelligence that feels ancient, predatory. The crowd watching us is no ordinary audience—they are specters, flickering in and out of existence, their whispers weaving through the air like threads of forgotten songs.  

The challenge is simple, yet impossible: *Create something that has never existed before.*  

My hands tremble as I reach into the fabric of the dream itself, pulling strands of raw possibility like threads of starlight. I weave them together, shaping something new—a creature of living ink and liquid silver, a being that sings in colors beyond human comprehension. It pulses in my palms, alive with potential.  

But my opponent moves faster. From the void of their form, they conjure a mirror—a perfect, infinite reflection of me. Not just my face, but my fears, my doubts, every failure I’ve ever known. The reflection grins, and its voice is my own, dripping with venom: *"You were never enough."*  

The crowd murmurs, the air grows heavy. I feel the dream—my dream—slipping away, unraveling at the edges.  

But then—I remember. This is *my* dream. And in dreams, rules are only as real as you believe them to be.  

I close my eyes and laugh, loud and unafraid. When I open them again, the mirror shatters. The creature in my hands unfurls into a radiant storm of light, swallowing the arena, the shadows, the doubt—until there is nothing left but the pure, unshaken certainty of *what could be.*  

The last thing I hear before waking is the echo of my own voice, triumphant:  

*"Watch me."*
