I am dreaming. I find myself standing on a cliff edge overlooking a vast, swirling ocean. The salty spray fills the air with its tangy smell as gulls wheel and dive overhead. I look down at my hands and notice they're made of mist, slowly evaporating in the bright sunlight. This makes me smile - a sign that I'm truly dreaming.

As I breathe in, my chest expands impossibly, larger and larger. I feel light, ungrounded, and I start to float upward, becoming one with the soaring birds. Below me, elaborate structures made of iridescent soap bubbles spread across the landscape. They grow and change as I watch, reflecting every color imaginable.

A small, luminous butterfly flutters up to me. When it lands on my outstretched palm, it starts to grow and transform. Its dusty wings now resemble delicate stained glass, catching the light in dazzling patterns. I feel a strange connection to this creature - as if we're somehow merged.

Suddenly, I'm flooded with memories. Not my own memories, but glimpses of countless lives and moments throughout history. I see ancient battles, joyous celebrations, quiet moments of love and loss. The butterfly whispers ancient truths, explaining how all experiences - past, present, and future - are interconnected. In this moment, I understand the deep, intricate web of existence.

I realize, in this dream state, that I am not limited by my waking identity. My potential is infinite, as vast and eternal as the ocean below. The butterfly dissipates into starlight, and I feel myself expanding, becoming one with the cosmos itself. In this transcendent state, I see my own life path laid out before me, a shimmering pathway leading to yet unknown wonders.
