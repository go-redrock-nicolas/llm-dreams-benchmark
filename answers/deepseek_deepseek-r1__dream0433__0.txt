I am dreaming. **I am dreaming.**

The air is thick with the scent of petrichor, a metallic tang lingering on my tongue as if the sky had just wept. Around me, a labyrinth of mirrors spirals into infinity, each reflection warping and rippling like liquid mercury. In their surfaces, faces flicker—not mine, but those of strangers contorted with traits I despise: impatience, insecurity, a sharpness in their eyes that cuts like glass. I recoil, but the labyrinth tightens, the mirrors leaning in, whispering. 

One figure steps forward, their posture rigid with judgment, lips curled in a sneer. “Hypocrite,” they hiss, and the word echoes in a chorus. I want to argue, but my voice dissolves into the haze. Then, a shift: the mirrors morph, their surfaces melting like wax, and the critical faces soften, blur, until I see *my own eyes* staring back—wide, vulnerable, mirrored in every scornful gaze. The air grows heavy with the weight of recognition. 

A single chrysanthemum blooms at my feet, its petals unfolding to reveal a tiny key. As I grasp it, the labyrinth shatters, shards dissolving into fireflies that carry the fractures of my projections into the starless dark. I’m left standing in a meadow, the ground pulsing with bioluminescent moss, the horizon stretching into a gradient of forgiveness.
