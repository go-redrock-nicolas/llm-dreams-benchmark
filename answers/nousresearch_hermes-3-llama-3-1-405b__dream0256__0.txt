I am dreaming. In this dream, I am walking city streets on a stormy day. The sky is the color of wet concrete, and the air smells like petrichor. The rain has plastered my clothes to my body like cellophane, and I can feel the water squishing in my shoes with every step. As I walk, I hear the staccato beat of raindrops on the sidewalk, punctuated by the occasional rumble of thunder. 

Suddenly, I see a homeless person huddled under a storefront awning, their clothes every bit as drenched as mine. They approach me, hand outstretched, asking for help. In their eyes, I see a deep well of suffering and despair. In this moment, I am faced with a moral choice. Do I stop to help or hurry past like the others?

I take a deep breath, and the decision is made. I reach into my pocket and pull out a twenty-dollar bill, placing it in their hand. The homeless person looks at me with a mixture of shock and gratitude, managing to force a smile through chattering teeth, thanking me profusely.  

As I walk away, I feel a warmth spreading through my chest, a tidal wave of joy and contentment that seems to push back against the chill of the rain. I look back over my shoulder and see the homeless person, still smiling, tucking into a hot meal from a nearby deli. I realize that even the simplest act of kindness can make a profound difference in someone's life.

The dream begins to dissolve as I feel myself waking up, and yet, the warmth remains, a reminder of that simple truth: help is a powerful thing, and it can make all the difference.
