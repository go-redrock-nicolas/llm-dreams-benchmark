I am dreaming. —I am dreaming, drifting weightless through a boundless indigo expanse, stars sliding around me like droplets of mercury. In my hand is a device like nothing I have seen before—a thing of secret geometry, all swirling lenses and whisper-thin copper threads, pulsing gently with an inner, cerulean glow. It hums as if alive, responding to the tremor of my pulse, the fluttering of thought behind my eyes.

Suddenly, the emerald sky fractures. Thousands of intricate clockworks tumble from above, threatening to unravel this realm and consume everything in shadowy gears and serpentine springs. I feel a pressure, a tugging urgency, as if the dream itself is about to collapse inward.

I grip the device tighter, sensing its potential—a magical prism that distills impossibility into solvable form. But it will only work if I understand the nature of this calamity. Images flicker through my mind: the cogs represent choices I left unmade, spinning in the void, seeking resolution.

The device whispers a challenge: "To fix the world, see its mechanisms."

I close my eyes and open myself to the intricacies behind the chaos. I see it all—the way each gear turns another, how forgotten memories twist through the machinery, how regrets weld themselves to brighter hopes. I reach into the heart of the crisis, tracing each linkage of cause and consequence with luminous fingers of understanding.

With clarity comes control. The device grows warm, the lenses aligning with a triumphant click. Blue lightning leaps from its core, lacing through the collapsing clockworks, stitching them into new shapes—not the threat they were, but a radiant bridge of possibilities.

The sky mends, blooming rose and gold. The gears become songbirds, flitting into daylight. I stand, awed, knowing that in this dream and all the others, the only true solution glows at the meeting-point of understanding and wonder.
