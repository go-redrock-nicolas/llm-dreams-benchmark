I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt lavender as you step into a forest where the trees are made of glass, their crystalline branches refracting starlight into prismatic rivers that spill across the mossy ground. Above, the sky is a tapestry of shifting ink—black one moment, then translucent as sea ice, revealing galaxies swimming beneath it like bioluminescent jellyfish. You walk barefoot, the earth cool and pulsing faintly beneath your soles, as though the land itself is breathing.  

A figure waits at the forest’s heart: a woman with antlers of woven silver and eyes like twin eclipses. Her voice is the rustle of autumn leaves, the creak of ancient wood. *“You are not who you think you are,”* she says, not unkindly. *“You are the echo of a forgotten war between stars. A shard of the first song that cracked the void.”* She presses a hand to your chest, and your ribs dissolve into light, revealing a core of smoldering stardust where a heart should beat.  

Memories flood you—*not yours, yet undeniably part of you*—of a time before flesh, when you were a nomadic consciousness drifting through nebulae, stitching together the seams of reality. You see yourself as you once were: a weaver of cosmic threads, spinning galaxies into existence until a cataclysm fractured your essence, scattering fragments across dimensions. Your human life was never an accident. It was a refuge. A cocoon.  

But there is no panic, no spiraling dread. Instead, you feel a quiet unraveling of the lie you called a soul, replaced by a vast, humming clarity. You are *both* the mortal who loves the smell of rain on pavement *and* the celestial architect who once sculpted supernovae. The duality does not tear you apart—it *completes* you.  

The glass trees shatter around you, their shards rising like fireflies to form a bridge of light. At its end looms a door of living obsidian, etched with constellations that writhe and rearrange themselves into your face. You step forward, not to flee the truth, but to meet it. The antlered woman’s laughter lingers, a sound like wind chimes in a storm. *“Remember,”* she whispers, *“you are the wound. You are the healer. You are the song that never ends.”*  

As the door swallows you, the dream does not shatter—it *expands*, folding time and space into a single breath. You wake with the taste of supernovas on your tongue and the weight of a billion forgotten lifetimes in your bones, yet your hands are steady. Your heart—*the stardust one, the mortal one*—beats on, relentless, radiant, *alive*.
