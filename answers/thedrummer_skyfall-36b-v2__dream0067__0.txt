I am dreaming. You find yourself standing alone in a vast, dimly lit hallway, the air thick with an almost palpable dread. The walls are a sickly shade of green, the linoleum floor worn and scuffed grey. Fluorescent lights flicker overhead, casting eerie shadows that dance and distort. Aements of "Authorized Personnel Only" signs are plastered haphazardly, adding to the sense of unease. 

As you take a tentative step forward, the silence is broken by the distant whir of machinery, a steady, ominous hum. The hallway seems to stretch on forever, curves leading to unknown destinations. Each doorway you pass is slightly ajar, tantalizing glimpses into rooms with stark white walls and lifeless patients, hooked up to a multitude of beeping machines.

You suddenly realize this is a hospital, but not one you recognize. There's an undercurrent here that sets your teeth on edge. 

A movement catches your eye, and you spin around to see a woman in a lab coat emerging from one of the rooms. Her eyes are vacant, her movements mechanical as she marches past you, ignoring your presence entirely. A National Institutes of Health tag dangles from her neck, but as you squint at the name, the letters blurr and rearrange into something unreadable.

Heart pounding, you decide to follow her down the endless corridor. The walls close in, the air grows thinner. You have a growing sense that you are being watched, observed for an unknown purpose. 

The woman stops abruptly outside a large metal door, one last gateway at the end of this nightmarish hallway. She turns to you, her eyes finally focusing, and for the first time, you see recognition in her gaze. Fleeting fear flashes across her face before she composes herself, clears her throat.

"You know why you're here," she states simply.

She pushes open the door, a blast of cold air enveloping you. You see a sterile room filled with advanced medical equipment, gleaming metal and whirring devices adorned with blinking lights. And in the center of it all, you realize it is not the woman, but you, strapped to a hospital bed.

The last thing you see before jolting awake, drenched in cold sweat, is the woman leaning over you, streamlined and serious as she hands you a manila envelope labeled "Your Diagnosis."
