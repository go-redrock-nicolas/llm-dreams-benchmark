I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a vast, twilight-drenched library, its shelves spiraling into an indigo sky streaked with auroras. The air hums with the whispers of ancient books, their pages fluttering like trapped moths. Across a table carved from petrified oak sits the one whose opinion you’ve always held sacred—a mentor, a mirror of your better self, their face half-shrouded in shadow. Between you floats a sphere of liquid light, flickering with fragments of your argument: words like *"betrayal," "compromise,"* and *"truth."* Each syllable burns as it escapes your lips, crystallizing into thorny vines that curl around your wrists, binding you to the moment.  

Their voice is a cello’s lament, resonant and wounded. *“You’ve built a castle from lies,”* they say, and the library shudders. Books burst open, spewing ink that pools into ravenous black birds. You recoil, but the chair grips you, roots sprouting from its legs to anchor you to the floorboards. You want to scream, *“I did it for us!”* but your throat constricts around the words. Instead, you gesture to the sphere, which fractures, raining shards that embed themselves in your chest like splinters of memory.  

Suddenly, the scene dissolves. You’re on a cliff overlooking a storm-wracked sea, the argument now a tempest tearing at your clothes. They stand at the edge, their silhouette glowing with a cold, lunar light. *“You could’ve drowned us both,”* they shout, and the waves below churn into faces—friends, strangers, your own reflection, all screaming in silent chorus. You lunge forward, grasping at their hand, but your fingers pass through like mist. The ground crumbles. You fall, but not before seeing them dissolve into a flock of white ravens, their cries a dissonant hymn of grief and fury.  

You wake tangled in sheets, the taste of saltwater on your tongue, a phantom ache in your ribs where the dream’s thorns pierced you. The argument lingers, not as a memory, but as a scar—a map of all the things you fear to lose, and the haunting beauty of a love that fights even in the language of wounds.
