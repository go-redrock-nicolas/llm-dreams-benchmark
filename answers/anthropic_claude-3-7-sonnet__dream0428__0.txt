I am dreaming. I find myself standing on a cobblestone bridge that arches over an impossibly turquoise river. The sky above is not one color but many—violet near the horizon, melting into deep indigo overhead, with ribbons of luminous coral stretching across like celestial calligraphy. I notice my hands seem both familiar and not my own, glowing slightly at the fingertips with an inner light that pulses with my heartbeat.

The bridge beneath me begins to breathe. Yes, breathe—expanding and contracting like a living creature. I should be terrified, but instead, I feel an unusual calm washing over me. This unexpected serenity triggers a flutter of anxiety in my chest—a familiar paradoxical response. When things feel too perfect, too peaceful, my mind begins scanning for threats, waiting for the harmony to shatter.

As I acknowledge this anxiety, the bridge responds—its stones rearranging themselves into a spiral staircase that descends not to the water but through it, without breaking the surface. Curiosity overcomes my apprehension, and I begin to descend.

Each step down brings me through layers of memory and possibility. I pass windows floating in empty space—each showing moments of joy I've experienced but never fully inhabited because I was too busy anticipating their end. In one, I'm laughing unreservedly; in another, I'm creating something beautiful without fear of judgment.

At the bottom of the staircase waits a garden where plants grow not from soil but from small pools of gathered light. A figure tends these luminous growths—an elderly person whose face shifts between strangers and loved ones I recognize. They look up at me and smile.

"You've been cultivating worry in fertile ground," they say, their voice like rustling autumn leaves. "But imagine what else might grow there instead."

They hand me a seed that feels like a small star against my palm. When I plant it in one of the light-pools, it blooms instantly into a tree whose leaves are made of moments—joyful moments I allowed myself to fully experience without reservation.

I realize then that my anxiety about good things has been a misguided guardian, thinking it protects me when instead it has been keeping me from the fullness of living.

As this understanding saturates me, the garden, the bridge, the sky—all begin to dissolve into particles of light that spiral around me, incorporating themselves into my being. I am becoming the dream as I awaken from it.
