I am dreaming. Imagine standing in the middle of an awe-inspiring coliseum, seated on a metal throne with a vast crown resting upon your head. The cheers of a bloodthirsty mob cascade down, echoing in your ears as if they’re the backing track of a grand opera. Around you, an iron gate separates you from a cage that holds an immense beast—a hulking hybrid of lion, dragon, and bear. Your breathing slows as you glance down at the weapon in your hands: a futuristic broadsword with a blade shimmering like liquid light, as if torn from the brightest star. The beast shifts, roaring with unimaginable force, its eyes glowing with a predatory ferocity. Suddenly, the gate swings open, and as the beast charges, your dream shifts to a high-octane chase through an enchanted forest. The ground rumbles beneath your feet, and the beast’s hot breath steams against your back. Each second is an adrenaline-charged blur as you leap over gnarled roots and dodge snapping jaws. With every heartbeat, your grip tightens on your weapon, and your focus sharpens. The dream reaches its climax with a final moment of triumph—or is it defeat? The decision lies in how you wield your weapon against the beast, its roar fading into the ether as the waking world encloses you in silence.
