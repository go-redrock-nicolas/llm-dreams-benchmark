I am dreaming. ...you slipped quietly into the enchanted forest, your feet barely touching the golden dust that enveloped your steps. The trees towered above, their graceful branches interlocking above your head to form a tranquil canopy of green. The air was crisp and clean, scented with the sugar sweetness of honey and the heady perfume of roses.

A soft caress made its way up your arm, starting from your fingers and instilling a sense of warmth and comfort. The touch, the strength, sent appreciative notes throughout your nervous system.

"We're here. We're safe," you heard. The voice was familiar and pleasant, the owner just hidden from view in the background.

A faun emerged in a flash, as if from a dream. Where a boy might have a face, he had the upper body of a man while his lower torso resembled a goat's. His boyish beard was matted, his stone eyes dancing with mischievous lust crowding out any room for benevolence. 

The faun approached you, eyes flashing darker than before. "Dance with me," he whispered, voice peppered with cruel mockery. "Tell me your secrets, what terrors your mother planted in your milk-sweet childhood. I want to know you. Numerous panic and cleave."

You broke away and began running, his thudding hoofsteps right on your heels. Your breaths intensified, your heartbeat roaring in your ears. The graceful natural beauty of the forest gave way to a dark, clotted nightmare. The wrongness of the faun followed, tellingly, shamefully.

"Your attachment issues come from your mama, from the imprint of her...torturing you with abandonment," he snapped. "Test her devotion! Run to her and see if she comes or sins against humanity!"
