I am dreaming. In my dream, I am walking down a familiar path, surrounded by overgrown bushes and towering trees. As I continue to walk, I notice a small clearing ahead. I approach it with caution, curious as to what awaits me. 

Suddenly, the clearing appears. It's a magnificent garden, filled with fragrant flowers and lush greenery. In the center of the garden, there's a sparkling reflecting pool. I'm drawn to it, intrigued to see what it holds. As I near the edge, I gaze into the crystal-clear water and see myself for the first time. 

The image I see in the water is not my current self but rather a younger version of me, perhaps five or six years old. She is playing in a sandbox, digging happily, creating castles and moats, lost in her imagination. Yet, mixed in with the joy and creativity is a sense of vulnerability and fear. I see how this young girl often felt like she had to toughen up, put on a brave face, in order to protect herself from potential harm or negative emotions. 

This realization strikes me deeply: my childhood experiences have shaped my current relationship patterns. I see now how I tend to close myself off emotionally, how I struggle with expressing my feelings and needs in intimate relationships. And I understand that this is a result of that little girl's need to protect herself. 

With this insight, I feel a profound sense of empathy for the younger version of myself. I reach out my hand and gently touch the surface of the water, breaking the reflection. The dream fades away, but I wake up feeling a renewed sense of self-awareness and compassion.
