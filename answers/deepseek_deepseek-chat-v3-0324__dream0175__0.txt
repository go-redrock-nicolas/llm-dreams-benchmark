I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric tension, thick with the scent of ozone and something older—something wild and untamed. The sky above is a swirling vortex of indigo and gold, streaked with veins of lightning that crackle but never strike the ground. Beneath my feet, the earth shifts, not solid, not liquid, but something in between, like walking on the skin of a living thing.  

Before me stretches a bridge—no, not a bridge, a spine. The arched vertebrae of some colossal, long-dead beast, its bones bleached white yet thrumming with latent energy. Each vertebra is a stepping stone, and between them yawns an abyss where shadows coil and whisper in languages I almost understand. The challenge is clear: cross. But the moment my foot touches the first bone, the whispers rise into a chorus, and the abyss exhales.  

The air distorts. The bones tremble. From the darkness below, shapes emerge—not monsters, not quite, but reflections. Every version of myself I’ve ever feared becoming, every path I didn’t take, every failure I narrowly escaped. They reach for me with hands just like mine, their eyes hollow with longing. *What if?* they murmur. *What if you had given up? What if you had chosen differently?*  

My pulse hammers, but I take another step. The bones tilt beneath me, threatening to spill me into the depths. The reflections wail, their voices a storm of regret. I feel their fingers brush my ankles, cold as forgotten graves. But I don’t look down. I can’t.  

Instead, I focus on the far side of the bridge, where a single figure stands—a silhouette wreathed in silver light. It’s me, but not me. A self I haven’t met yet. This one doesn’t speak, only watches, waiting to see if I’ll make it.  

The wind howls. The bridge groans. And I run—not away from the grasping hands, but toward the light, toward the unknown self who holds the next question, the next challenge, the next dream.  

The moment my foot touches solid ground, the abyss collapses into silence. The reflections dissolve like smoke. The figure ahead smiles, just slightly, and lifts a hand to point beyond—toward a horizon where the sky bleeds into stars, and the next trial begins.  

I wake, or maybe I don’t. The dream lingers, its weight pressing against my ribs, its whispers still echoing.  

*What will you become?*
