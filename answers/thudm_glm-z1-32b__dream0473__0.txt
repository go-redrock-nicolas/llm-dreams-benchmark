I am dreaming. ouserp-U
Dreaming, I am a moth suspended in the vapor of a fractured world. The air hums with the static of a trillion lost screens—Instagram feeds dissolving into neon mist, TikTok dances warping into centipede shadows that crawl up cold glass pillars. My fingers twitch toward phantom vibrations, but instead they brush the bark of a living keyboard-tree whose keys bloom violet when touched. Each petal unfurls a pop-up poem: *"You are here"*, inked in bioluminescent cursive that dissolves into confetti when I blink.  

A Blackphone glows in a puddle beneath my boots, its surface a liquid hologram of unopened emails shaped like origami frogs. One hops toward me—*urgent*—but as it alights on my wrist, the words unravel into a origami crane that takes flight, trailing confetti ribbons spelling ** (pause). The phone shatters into cricket casings that skitter into the walls.  

The floor transforms into a checkerboard of analog clocks. Every third hour is a mirror, reflecting me mid-yawn, mid-scroll, mid-life. In one pane, my reflection texts *"on my way"* as I engage in a tai chi sequence with a pocket watch; its pendulum is a live goldfish swimming through gears. In another, I'm standing in firewall ivy, stomping on Gatorade bottles that hiss *" notifications incoming"* when crushed.  

A flock of wind-up typewriter birds circles, pecking at my self-control like nests. I catch one, its carriage return stuck on **. Beneath its paper belly is a USB drive-carrot. Biting it, I taste the bitter parsley of mindfulness, the sweet root of unprocessed fear. The bird disintegrates into a postage stamp thatographs into a black hole, sucking in my compulsive behaviors like cosmic confetti.  

The walls become ticker-tape parades of dopamine hits—all greenlight arrows shaped like wasabi peas. I clap once, and they freeze mid-tumble, each scroll now a stationary origami zebra. When I touch its flank, the zebra's stripes shift from binary code to brushed silver, its eye a URL bar broadcasting *"127.0.0.1"*—localhost. I nibble a zebra's tail, crisp as a QR-code waffle, and taste the memory of a childhood kite made from a mylar balloon and a Sony Walkman.  

The ceiling melts into a server farm sky, servers blooming like lotuses from lotus pods. I climb a fiber-optic vine to pluck a data pod—it bruises my palm with the sting of a notification sound. Inside: a USB-shaped amber teardrop containing 3,654 hours of my life's second-screening. The teardrop floats toward a vortex labeled *"attention overflow error"* but I press my palm to it, transferring the hours into a birch tree growing from my left shoulder. Each kernel-sized leaf hums with the white noise of closed tabs, and the tree roots snake through my veins, pruning neural pathways like invasive species.  

When I wake, my phone screen is blank. The last remaining app icon is a magnifying glass looped inside itself, its handle forming a question mark. The wallpaper is a blank spreadsheet where every cell is emtpy—just the grid lines remain, glowing faintly gold. On the charger cord coiled on my bed, the USB-C port has grown a tiny violet origami forget-me-not.
