I am dreaming. You begin sprinting down a corridor lit by shuddering fluorescent bulbs. The walls are a sickly pale green that seems to pulse with each ringing footstep, and the floor under your shoes feels strangely pliable, almost like you’re pressing into the thick hide of some half-dormant creature. Every few seconds, you hear a distant crash echo through the hall, as if metal beams are folding in on themselves somewhere deep within the complex. An undercurrent of tension presses against your spine, urging you to move faster, to ignore the trembling in your legs, to pretend the flickers in the corners of your vision aren’t scurrying shadows of something neither fully human nor fully animal.

The hallway forks suddenly, splitting into two branching passages. To the left lies a flickering series of overhead lights, each popping into darkness in rhythmic sequence as though they’re counting down your approach. To the right, a staircase arcs downward, but the railing is torn away, and sinister black shapes shift in the gloom. You can’t be certain if you’re seeing actual movement or just the trick of a half-lit mind. 

A wave of dread ripples through your chest, and the sensation of time slowing to a trickle makes each breath quiver. Walls seem to tighten around you. You hear your heart in your ears, or maybe it’s the dull hum of machinery sputtering behind the sealed walls. Instinct compels you to choose the left corridor; you turn sharply, hurrying beneath the fading lights.

As you rush forward, you catch sight of jagged cracks spiderwebbing across the ceiling. Fine white dust drizzles onto your shoulders, marking your hair like ghostly confetti. You cover your mouth with a trembling hand, half-worried you’ll breathe in fragments of the building’s skeleton. The overhead lamps wink out one by one, seemingly chasing you. The final bulb goes dark just as you reach the end of the corridor, and you collide with a door covered in rusted metal plating. The ancient hinges squeal in protest as you wedge it open, stepping into a large industrial warehouse space.

Crates tower precariously to your left and right, so tall the topmost edges vanish into the gloom. A narrow beam of moonlight—where did that come from?—streams through a fractured skylight, illuminating swirling flakes of dust dancing through the air. Beyond the crates, you hear the sound of something scuttling, accompanied by unsettling scraping noises as though claws are dragging over the concrete floor. Your pulse quickens at the thought of lurking creatures ready to pounce. You instinctively take a few careful steps, leaning your body close to the walls of the crates to avoid detection.

Your fingers brush against a chain link fence that partitions this space from a labyrinth of shelves. The fence rattles ominously, and more dust rains down, swirling in that ghostly moonbeam. You find a gap in the chain links, big enough to slip through if you crouch low. Clambering on all fours, you ease yourself past the metal and into the shelving area. Rows upon rows of rotting books and broken equipment sprawl in perfect lines—a library of forgotten failures. 

In the distance, a set of emergency lights flickers overhead, feeble beams shining like lighthouses in a tempest. They silhouette a battered steel door that might just be an exit. But between you and that door, a shallow tide of black water stretches across the floor, its surface glinting blankly. A faint chemical tang wafts upward, and you realize you’re looking at an oil-slick sheen. One spark, one tiny flame, could devour the entire area in a violent conflagration.

The building groans; you feel the structure tremble beneath you like a caged beast on the verge of collapse. Urgency throbs behind your eyes. You swallow your panic and begin navigating the narrow ledge along the perimeter. Your shoes slip on the wet grit, and your breath catches in your throat when a chunk of the ledge gives way with a loud snap. A spasm of terror rushes through you—but you maintain your balance, pressing your back against the shelving. The metal is cold and smells of rust, a steady reminder of how this entire place is crumbling around you.

When you finally reach the steel door, your hands shake as you grab the handle. With a sharp yank, it creaks open. A tornado of dust whips into your face, making you choke momentarily. Beyond the threshold, you glimpse a new corridor with battered walls covered in graffiti that seems to shift under your gaze: cryptic shapes and swirling letters that rearrange themselves when you blink, as if alive. You sense the building will not relinquish you easily. But beyond these illusions, you can just make out a faint glow of red, possibly a neon exit sign or another hazard waiting to greet you.

Drawing in a breath, you collect your courage. The dream thickens, and the corridor feels as long as a lifetime. Every nerve in your body screams for escape. Yet you can’t shake the sense that something vast and unknowable watches from the cracks in the walls, from behind those crates, and from the shimmering edges of your vision. A dreadful hush falls, making each step echo thunderously.

You press forward. Step by step, heart pounding in your chest, arm trembling around the handle of a flashlight seized from a nearby shelf, you move toward that wavering red glow. Somewhere, distantly, the floor rumbles with fresh collapse; the building is determined to trap you forever. But you will keep moving, even as the dream warps and thrashes around you—because just around the next corner, beyond those twisting corridors and looming shadows, you sense your path to freedom. And in a dream as vivid and treacherous as this, the faintest glimmer of hope can shine brighter than any light.
