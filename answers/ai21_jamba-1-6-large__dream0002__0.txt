I am dreaming. The forest is dense, with towering trees that seem to stretch endlessly into the sky. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting a warm glow over the moss-covered ground. The air is crisp and fresh, filled with the earthy scent of damp soil and pine needles. As I walk, I can hear the gentle rustling of leaves and the occasional chirping of birds. 

But then, without warning, the sky darkens. The bright sunlight is replaced by an eerie, ominous grey. The wind picks up, rustling the trees with increasing intensity. I can hear the distant rumble of thunder, growing louder and more menacing with each passing moment. The once calm forest now feels foreboding, as if nature itself is bracing for the coming storm.

I quicken my pace, trying to find shelter before the storm hits. But the forest seems to close in around me, the trees growing closer together, their branches reaching out as if to block my path. The air is charged with electricity, and I can feel the hairs on my arms standing on end. The thunder grows louder, closer, and I can see flashes of lightning in the distance.

Suddenly, the heavens open up, and rain pours down in torrents. The forest is now a chaotic symphony of crashing rain, booming thunder, and crackling lightning. I run, slipping and sliding on the wet, muddy ground, desperate to find cover. But there's no shelter in sight, and the storm seems to follow me, its fury unmatched.

I wake up with a start, heart pounding, soaked in sweat. The storm in my dream was so real, so vivid, that it felt like I was really there, caught in its wrath. As I lie in bed, the remnants of the dream linger, the sound of thunder echoing in my mind.
