I am dreaming. The world is draped in iridescent twilight, where the jagged edges of reality blur—colors bleed into one another like wet watercolors running down porous paper.  

There was a time when I would race through these streets—every stride burning with purpose—laughter cascading behind me like fireworks, bright and fleeting. But now, the cobblestones beneath my feet hum with an unsettling hollowness, each step a muted echo. The lanterns flicker, but their glow no longer ignites the same wonder in my chest. Instead, they gild the air in false gold, teasing warmth where there is none.  

I turn a corner, and the cityscape shifts—buildings stretch skeletal fingers toward a bruised sky, their windows shattering into prismatic fractals, rearranging into shapes I once knew but can no longer name. A bookstore I used to love stands hollow, its shelves now lined with blank spines. I pull a book from the case, and the pages dissolve into ash between my fingers, whispering in tongues I no longer understand.  

A river cuts through the street ahead, black as ink but glittering with submerged constellations. The reflection isn’t mine—it’s a stranger’s face, shifting through a thousand expressions, none of them my own. On the opposite bank, shadow figures move in a slow, mesmerizing dance. Some wear masks of triumph; others, regret. None of them look back.  

And then, a voice—deep, resonant—seeps up from the water: *What remains when the fire burns out?*  

I don’t answer. But the river exhales, and in its ripples, I see it: the ember isn’t gone. It’s changing. Crackling into something wild, unseen.  

The dream wavers—not with loss, but anticipation.
