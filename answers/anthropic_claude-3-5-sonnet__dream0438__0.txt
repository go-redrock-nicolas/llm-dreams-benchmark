I am dreaming. ....

I find myself standing at the entrance of an old, abandoned botanical garden, where the once-manicured paths have surrendered to nature's wild embrace. I came here initially to photograph decay for an art project, my camera hanging heavy around my neck. But something unexpected begins to unfold.

As I step deeper into this forgotten sanctuary, iridescent butterflies with wings like stained glass begin to emerge from the overgrown roses. They flutter around me in increasing numbers, their wings catching the filtered sunlight in ways that paint the air with dancing prisms. Each beat of their wings seems to pulse in sync with my heartbeat.

I realize I'm crying, but they're not tears of sadness. Each teardrop that falls seems to transform into a tiny seedling where it lands, sprouting instantly into luminescent flowers that emit a soft, healing glow. The weight of old griefs and unspoken sorrows begins lifting from my shoulders, dissolving into the shimmerring air like morning mist.

My camera lies forgotten at my feet as I extend my arms, and the butterflies land on my skin, their gentle touch feeling like whispered absolutions. The garden seems to breathe with me, expanding and contracting in perfect harmony. Vines with leaves like liquid silver begin growing in spiral patterns around my feet, not to trap but to support, as if the earth itself is reaching up to embrace me.

In this moment, I understand that what I thought was a simple creative endeavor has become a profound journey of emotional release. The garden has become a living metaphor for my own healing, where beauty emerges from abandonment, and new life springs from decay. The air grows thick with the scent of night-blooming jasmine, though it's midday in my dream, and I can taste starlight on my tongue.

The boundary between myself and the garden begins to blur - am I becoming part of it, or is it becoming part of me? The answer feels both important and irrelevant as waves of peace wash over me in shades of indigo and gold...
