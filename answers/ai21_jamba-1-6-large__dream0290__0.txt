I am dreaming. As the vibrant dream unfolds, I find myself standing at the edge of a serene yet tumultuous forest. The trees whisper secrets of ancient wisdom, their leaves rustling with an ethereal glow. Overhead, the sky is a kaleidoscope of colors, blending hues of deep indigo, fiery orange, and soft lavender. The air hums with energy, a mix of tranquility and anticipation, like the calm before a storm.

Beside me, a wolf with fur as dark as midnight steps forward, his golden eyes piercing into my soul. It feels as though he's been my guide all along, waiting for this moment to reveal himself. Together, we step into the forest, where each step feels like a dance between reality and the unknown. The path ahead shimmers faintly, as though illuminated by unseen stars beneath our feet.

The forest grows denser, the light from the sky barely penetrating the canopy of leaves. Yet, I feel no fear, only curiosity. My hands skim the bark of trees, glowing faintly with rivulets of golden sap. The earth beneath me feels alive, vibrating with every step.

Soon, I hear the faint sound of rushing water. Following the sound, I am greeted by a river, its surface alive with colors I’ve never seen—tints of electric blue and shimmering gold, flowing like liquid light. On the opposite bank, a figure stands, their form bathed in a silvery glow. Though I can't make out their face, I feel a sense of familiarity, as though I've known them in another lifetime.

The wolf lets out a soft howl, as if in acknowledgment of the figure. Without hesitation, the wolf steps into the river, urging me to follow. As I step into the water, it feels warm like summer rain, its current gentle yet insistent. With every step, I feel lighter, as if the river is washing away layers of doubt and fear I didn’t even know I carried.

Finally, we reach the other side. The figure is still there, waiting. As I draw closer, they extend a hand—not to take mine, but to present something. It’s a small, glowing seed, pulsating with yellow light. The figure gently places the seed in the ground before me, and I feel an overwhelming urge to plant it.

I kneel down and bury the seed into the rich, dark earth. As I do, the ground trembles lightly, and a tiny sprout emerges. Within seconds, it grows into a magnificent tree, its branches spreading wide, adorned with blossoms of every color. They shimmer like tiny stars, their fragrance intoxicating.

I look to the wolf, now sitting beside me, his golden eyes reflecting the tree’s glow. The figure steps closer, their form shifting. Slowly, their features become clear, and I realize it’s me—an older version of myself, yet ageless. Their presence radiates serenity, like someone who has walked through storms and found peace. They smile gently, and though they speak no words, I understand everything.

This is a dream, but it’s also a truth. The seed was my courage. The tree is my strength. The river, the journey. The wolf, intuition. And the figure, my future self reminding me of all I am capable of becoming.

I awake feeling grounded and alive, as though the dream was more than a dream. It was a reminder of who I am and what I carry within.
