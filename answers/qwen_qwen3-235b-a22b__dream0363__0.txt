I am dreaming. But this isn't like any dream I've known before.  It's vivid, tangible, *electric*.  I stand at the base of a mountain, but it's not a mountain of rock and earth.  It's a mountain of memories, of faces I've loved and lost, of words I've swallowed, smiles I've faked, moments I've locked away to keep the peace.  And the mountain is *boiling*.

Dark clouds swirl above, not with rain, but with whispers—half-heard phrases, accusations, truths I've denied, all circling like vultures overhead.  My chest tightens as I begin to climb, each step dragging me deeper into the core.  My feet are bare and bleed, yet I don’t stop. The pressure is building—deep, guttural, *molten*. Something is rising toward the surface.

And then *it erupts*.  
I fall to my knees as a scream tears from me, but it’s no ordinary sound—it’s fire, crimson and white, bursting skyward in a jagged beam of pure catharsis. My suppressed fury—years of it—blasts through the mountain, turning memories to ash, revealing the long-buried core of pain.

The sky cracks, not from lightning, but from *emotion*, streaks of scarlet and indigo splitting the heavens. I am screaming, crying, roaring with rage and relief. The ground trembles, not from fear, but from *acknowledgment*. This is what happens when we give the suppressed room to speak.

I rise, trembling, battered, but *unbowed*. The mountain is now a crater, glowing and alive, pulsating with a raw, reddish light. In the crater's center stands a figure—myself, as I might have been, if I had always been honest. Eyes like broken mirrors showing truths I can't unsee. This part of me has swallowed its anger too long, forged armor from silence, and now has emerged, shattered and still standing.

A wind kicks up, carrying embers of old promises, carried off into the strange sky. I feel the weight of the eruption still humming through me, coursing like lava beneath my skin. But the air is clean. The scream was necessary. And somewhere in the distance, something beautiful begins to grow—the kind of strength that only comes after sorrow has been unearthed and laid bare beneath the stars.

I am still me, but not the same me. I have screamed into the crater of my soul—and something *listened*.
