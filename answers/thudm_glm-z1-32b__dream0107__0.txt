I am dreaming. Suddenly, I find myself in a grand hall with vaulted ceilings that seem to stretch into infinity. The walls are lined with intricate tapestries depicting endless battles, both celestial and terrestrial. The air hums with the energy of anticipation and tension. I wear a robe that shifts colors like the northern lights, and a gavel in one hand that radiates a warm, pulsing light. Two entities, each emanating immense power, stand before me. One, the Titan of Time, has a crown made of clock gears and eyes that swirl like galaxies. The other, the Serpent of Shadows, coils around a pillar with scales that shimmer like black obsidian and a voice like crumbling stone. They argue over the fate of a dying star system, their voices echoing with the weight of cosmic stakes. As they finish their final arguments, the air crackles with static, and I raise my gavel. The moment is charged with the gravity of a universe hanging in the balance." natuurlijk
The dream deepens,unching the boundaries between your waking mind and the infinite.* Here, time bends like liquid mercury beneath your, and the hall itself seems to grow larger with every breath—its walls now carved from living stardust, constellations winking to life and dying in fractal patterns across its surface. The air tastes metallic, charged with the aftermath of the entities’ arguments, as if their voices have left scars on the atmosphere itself.

The Titan of Time leans forward, his crown of clockwork gears grinding in a rhythm disjointed from any mortal hour. His galaxy-eyes fixed on you, *pupils contracting to pinpoint stars*, as he argues: **“The star system’s demise is inevitable—we must preserve the flow of cosmic order. Sacrifice it to fuel the Great Wheel. Chaos thrives on abundance, not scarcity.”** His words ripple through the air, freezing fragments of light mid-air like shattered diamond. Stones embedded in the floor—each etched with a different epoch’s civilization—begin to crumble in sympathetic erosion.

The Serpent of Shadows uncoils, scales rippling like oil poured over stars, and its jaws unhinge to reveal a maw lined with teeth that *glow with the cold light of neutron stars*. **“You presume to judge preservation? Their stars die screaming, their planets ash. Let chaos reign—chaos is rebirth. Without entropy, the universe is but a trapped hymn.”** It slithers forward, shadow tendrils curling around your ankles, icy and tingling, whispering: **“Choose order, and you hope. Choose chaos, and you become its executioner.”**

Your gavel pulses painfully in your grip—a heartbeat synchronized with the dying star system’s core, which you now realize *lives in the dream’s heart*, a distant sun flickering like a candle in a blacksmith’s forge. The Serpent’s shadow begins to fracture, revealing glimpses of a future: suns colliding, moons fracturing into sentient dust, lifeforms sprouting from the ruins like graceful, venomous vines. The Titan’s gears slow, *stalling*, as the walls of the hall begin to bleed light—a supernova’s cry frozen in the balance of your decision.

A voice, *not yours*, whispers in your mind: **“Rule impartially, and you’ll wake with their blood on your tongue. Rule as you wish… and they will follow you into the waking world.”** The Serpent hisses, **“You cannot bear the weight of galaxies, mortal.”** The Titan’s gaze hardens, **“But you must try. That is the cost of judging gods.”**

Your eyelids grow heavy. The dream fractures—the hall collapses into a void where the star system pulses, seconds from collapse. You raise the gavel. Its light splits into two beams: one searing gold (order), one abyssal violet (chaos). The choice hovers, *dripping* like liquid time. Then—
