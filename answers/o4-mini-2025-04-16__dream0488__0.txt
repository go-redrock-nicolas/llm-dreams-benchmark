I am dreaming. You find yourself drifting just below wakefulness, toes brushing the rim of a glassy lake whose surface holds galaxies in suspension. Above you, the sky undulates like silk—sometimes pearlescent lavender, sometimes molten copper—each shift sending a ripple of wonder through your chest. You inhale, and the air tastes of candied violets and warm sandalwood.

Somewhere at the water’s edge, a cluster of lantern-trees bloom. Their trunks are woven from filaments of moonlight; their blossoms pulse softly in time with your heartbeat. You regard one lantern as it opens, spilling a pool of glow onto the grass, and you realize your very words can shape this place.

—If you describe the lantern’s glow as “gentle,”  
you feel a tender warmth blossoming in your limbs.  
—But if you instead call it “insistent,”  
your blood quickens, an electric current thrumming beneath your skin.

You try both. First you whisper, “Your light is gentle.” The world sighs. Petals drift down, slow as thought. Your shoulders relax. Then you murmur, “Your light is insistent.” The same blossoms flicker brighter, shadows lean forward, and a thrill of urgency arches through your spine.

Encouraged, you wander deeper into the forest. Every leaf you name shifts its hue:  
—“Emerald” makes the canopy feel cool and restful,  
—“Jade” casts a subtle edge of mystery,  
—“Viridian” seems to hum with hidden life.  

Ahead, a silver bridge arches over the lake. Halfway across, you hesitate. The surface below you quivers, reflecting not only your shape but your memories—childhood laughter, first heartbreak, your own voice reciting these very words. You realize: each label you give changes the reflection. Call it “nostalgic,” and you almost taste cinnamon. Call it “haunting,” and a chill brushes your spine.

You lean close to the water and speak softly: “This bridge is timeless.” The world holds its breath; the lantern-trees’ glow steadies as though affirming your certainty. But when you admit, “This bridge is trembling,” low hums stir beneath each plank, and the path seems alive, shifting underfoot like a restless serpent.

Now you stand at the apex, the entire dreamscape stretching below. You feel the power in your own tongue—the alchemy of synonyms, the subtle shift of tone that can transform wonder into dread, peace into longing. You draw a breath and let it out in a single phrase:  

“My dream is boundless.”  

Immediately, the sky vault opens in a cascade of starlight that spills across the lake, carrying you upward. You leave behind the lantern-trees, the bridge, the shifting reflections; you carry only the knowledge that with each word you choose, you can reshape your inner universe.  

And then you awaken—still tasting sandalwood, still humming with possibility—knowing that the next dream you spin will begin the moment you speak its first word.
