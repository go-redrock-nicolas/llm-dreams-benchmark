I am dreaming. The endless, iridescent sky above churns with colors that do not exist in the waking world—shimmering threads of amethyst lightning weaving between clouds that drip stars like rain.  I walk barefoot across a desert made of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting not my face, but scenes I’ve never witnessed—foreign rooms, unfamiliar people—pieces of a puzzle I don’t yet understand.  In the distance, a forest of crystal trees hums with a low, mournful tone that vibrates in my bones.  I know without knowing that I must reach it.

When I arrive, the air thickens with the scent of forgotten memories.  A figure waits at the base of the largest tree—a woman with eyes like twin eclipses, her hair a cascade of fireflies suspended in night.  You *remember,* she says, though I do not recognize her. The forest dims, and suddenly, I am watching **him**—my father—though in the dream, I feel a distance deeper than blood. He stands at the edge of a storm-battered cliff, one hand clutching a letter yellowed with age, the other upturned toward a raven that watches him in silence. I *see* what he has done—what he has buried so far inside that even he no longer hears its echo.  He let someone die.  Not by accident, but through silence. Through a choice made under shadow.

And then I am me again, kneeling in the crystal forest, tears dripping onto the ground only to rise as smoke. The fireflies-twisted-into-human-form touches my forehead and whispers: *Some truths are knives that cut both the hand and the heart.* I wake from the dream, drenched in sweat and a sorrow I do not know how to carry.

The morning is too bright, the world cruel in its normalcy.  He makes coffee at the kitchen counter, whistling the same tune he did when I was a child, the one he used to hum as he tucked me in.  I stare at the back of his head, at the familiar slant of his shoulders, at the ways he seems *good*. And yet—beneath that easy certainty, I now bear a weight like an iron chain coiled just below my ribs, silent and merciless. The burden is mine now. And the dream… the dream won’t let me look at him the same again.
