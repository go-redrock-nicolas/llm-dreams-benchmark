I am dreaming. I'm lying on my bed, closed my eyes and imagine something amazing. 

I see a beautiful city full of colorful buildings, happy people and cute animals. The weather is perfect, not too hot or cold, just right for outdoor activities. Music is playing in the background, creating a sense of joy and wonder.

I feel like I can fly, so I do.  I soar through the sky, admiring the scenery from above.  I wave to people below, who stop to watch me curiously.

I meet a friendly robot named Rex, who invites me to play with him.  He has many interesting games and toys, such as puzzle solving, dancing contest, virtual reality exploration etc.

I solve some riddles by using logical thinking combined with creativity. For example:

What do you call someone who loves both cats and dogs?

A "catdogian"! 

Why are the ocean waves so soothing?

Because they remind me of the sound of rain on my roof back home, which used to lull me into sleep every night.

How do you make a rock float in midair without using magic? 

By making it out of foam instead.
