I am dreaming. The dream begins with a soft, golden light filtering through the leaves of an ancient, gnarled tree, casting dappled shadows on the lush grass beneath. I am standing in a vast, verdant meadow, the air filled with the sweet scent of wildflowers and the gentle hum of nature. The sky above is a canvas of cotton-candy clouds, painted in hues of pink and blue, as if the sun is both rising and setting at the same time.

I feel a profound sense of tranquility and clarity, as if the very air is whispering secrets of simplicity and purpose. The urge to radically simplify my life is not just a thought, but a tangible force, a warm, golden light that pulses within me, guiding my actions.

I look down at my hands, and they are no longer the hands of a modern person, but calloused and strong, the nails rimmed with dirt. I am wearing a simple, linen tunic, the fabric soft and worn from years of use. I am barefoot, the cool earth beneath my feet grounding me, connecting me to the world in a way I've never experienced before.

In the distance, I see a small, stone cottage, smoke curling gently from its chimney. As I approach, I see that the cottage is surrounded by a lush garden, filled with vibrant vegetables and herbs. A small, crystal-clear stream babbles nearby, the water sparkling in the dappled sunlight.

I enter the cottage, the door creaking softly on its hinges. Inside, the space is small but cozy, filled with the warm glow of a fire in the hearth. There is a simple bed in one corner, a small table and chairs in another, and a bookshelf filled with well-loved tomes. A loaf of fresh bread sits on the table, along with a jug of what I assume is fresh milk.

I sit down at the table, the wood smooth and familiar beneath my hands. I take a deep breath, the scent of the bread and the fire filling my lungs. I feel a sense of peace, of rightness. This is what matters, I realize. This simplicity, this connection to the earth and to myself. This is what I have been yearning for.

I stand up, the chair scraping softly on the stone floor. I walk back outside, the sun warm on my face. I look out at the meadow, the tree, the garden, and I know what I must do. I must simplify, I must focus on what truly matters. I must live in harmony with the earth, with myself.

I start to work, the tasks coming naturally to me. I tend to the garden, the soil warm and rich beneath my fingers. I draw water from the stream, the cool liquid refreshing. I bake bread, the kneading of the dough a soothing, rhythmic task. I read, the words on the pages speaking to my soul.

As the sun sets, painting the sky with hues of orange and red, I sit down at the table, a simple meal of bread, cheese, and vegetables before me. I eat slowly, savoring each bite, each flavor. I am content, at peace. I have simplified, I have focused on what truly matters. And in doing so, I have found a depth of happiness and fulfillment that I have never known before.

The dream fades, the images and sensations lingering, a reminder of the path I wish to follow. I wake up, the urge to simplify still strong within me, a beacon guiding me towards a simpler, more meaningful life.
