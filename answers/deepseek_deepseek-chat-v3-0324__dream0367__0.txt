I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and jasmine, a sweet heaviness clinging to my skin. I stand at the edge of a shifting forest—no, not just one forest, but many overlapping, as though a dozen realities have been layered together like translucent veils. The trees are oak and birch in one moment, then twisted black coral in the next, their branches elongating into skeletal fingers before softening again into groves of cherry blossoms, petals falling like snowflakes.  

A path winds forward, but its nature is uncertain. Sometimes it is an oak-lined trail dappled with golden sunlight; other times, it is a slick bridge of bone-white marble, stretching over an abyss filled with whispering shadows. When I blink, a third version appears—a cobbled street, stained with rain and glowing with the reflection of lanterns that float without strings.  

Movement flickers at the periphery of my vision. A woman in a crimson cloak—or is it a crow with feathers like liquid ink?—paces just beyond my grasp, vanishing every time I turn my head. She leaves behind a trail of footprints that shift from bare human toes to claw marks to nothing at all.  

**"Choose a truth,"** the wind seems to murmur—but no, it’s not the wind, it’s a chorus of voices, some singing, some keening, some laughing. Yet when I listen closely, the words rearrange themselves: *Don’t choose. All truths breathe at once.*  

I step forward, and the ground beneath me warps. Am I walking on moss, on cracked glass, on the ribs of some long-dead leviathan? The answer is *yes*—somehow, all at the same time. The more I try to pin down a single reality, the more the dream resists, offering fractal variations instead. A river nearby flows uphill in one glance, then shatters into a flock of silver-winged moths the next.  

And then I see the door. It is carved from a single immense gemstone—amber or amethyst or perhaps obsidian—its surface ripple with faces that press against it from within, mouths open in silent pleas or laughter. It stands at the end of all possible paths at once, simultaneously open, closed, and burning.  

Do I knock? Push it? Run away? The dream holds its breath, content to let me stand at the precipice of infinite meanings, forever on the verge of understanding.  

And then—I wake, the taste of unspoken answers still lingering on my tongue.
