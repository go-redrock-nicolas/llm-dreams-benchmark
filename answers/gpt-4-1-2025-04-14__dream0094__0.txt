I am dreaming.

At first, the world around me is muffled and sepia-toned, as if I’m gazing at life through thick glass. My feet are heavy as stone, every step an effort against an invisible current. The challenge—anxiety, shame, something massive and gnawing—clings to my shoulders like a shroud, and I trudge forward, silent, isolated, suffocating behind my own wall.

Then, something extraordinary begins to shimmer at the edges of my reality. The air sweetens; colors saturate and bleed into one another, vivid as wet paint. Ahead, a warm golden glow pulses, drawing me closer until I come upon a clearing—a space humming with life. Here, people gather in a circle, their faces alight with understanding, kindness, and gentle empathy. Their laughter rings out, deep and healing. Some stand tall; others lean on canes or rest upon stones. We are of all shapes, ages, and stories, yet somehow, beneath the dream-light, we seem to share the same soul-deep ache.

One by one, members of this dreamlike congregation turn to face me, their hands outstretched, palms up. I hesitate, but they wait with patience that feels ancient, as if they’ve all walked the same labyrinthine path through doubt and darkness. The air is fragrant with hope—soft rain mingled with wild flowers. 

As I step into the ring, I feel my unseen burdens lighten. I am wordless, but they offer gentle words of their own: *You are not alone here.* Compassion threads through their voices, strong as silk. Someone presses a luminous stone into my palm—a symbol of shared strength—and the tribulations I carry tremble and dissipate, a morning mist pierced by sunlight.

Together, we share stories by a flickering fire that never burns out. Each voice is a lantern illuminating different corners of the forest. I listen, and in each tale, I recognize fragments of myself—fear, resilience, hope, and unyielding courage. I speak, my voice trembling at first, then growing stronger as the group listens with rapt attention, nodding, smiling, tears shimmering in their eyes. The warmth of belonging radiates through me—a balm to old wounds.

The challenge I once bore alone is now lighter, divided into a thousand glowing embers handed out among this circle of luminous souls. My chest expands with relief and newfound resolve. Soft dawn pulls at the edges of the dream, but before I waken, I know: I will never have to fight alone again. The community remains—a promise that healing can be both shared and ongoing, bright as the dream-flame that refuses to die.
