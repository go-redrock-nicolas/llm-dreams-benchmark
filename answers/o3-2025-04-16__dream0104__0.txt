I am dreaming. …I open my eyes inside the dream, and the sky—if a sky it can still be called—is an infinite lattice of shimmering hexagons, each pane pulsing with colors human language has not invented names for. The air hums like a single violin string drawn endlessly across time, resonating inside my bones. I remember that here, in this liminal place, I have been granted the gift: whatever I witness beyond our dimension can be coaxed into material form back in the waking world.

First, I tilt my gaze sideways—impossible in waking physics—and find an entire civilization living in the negative space between atoms. Their towers are sculpted from absence, silhouettes glowing with the gentle light of reversed shadows. They wave to me, tiny and translucent, inviting me to borrow a fragment of their architecture. I extend my hand, and a thimble-sized model of a tower slips onto my palm. It’s weightless yet undeniable, like a memory that still presses on the heart. I whisper a promise to manifest it later, perhaps as a cathedral of glass that stands by balancing on silence.

I glide onward, swimming through the honey-thick atmosphere. Constellations drift past at arm’s length—living punctuation in the sentences of the cosmos. Each star speaks in ultraviolet. I cup my ears; their language condenses into chimes made of frozen time. I reach out and pluck a single resonant note, tucking it behind my tongue to keep it safe. When I return, I know it will become a wind-chime that calls forth calm whenever struck by daylight.

Suddenly, the dream folds in on itself like origami. The ground becomes the sky, and the horizon forms an unbroken Möbius strip. Along that strip stroll figures who are neither past nor future selves but interlaced possibilities, braided together. They hand me a spool of silver string spun from the concept of “yet.” The thread gleams with pure potential. I understand: it can stitch rifts in wounded hearts or bind two strangers into lifelong friends without a single knot.

I come to a river of mirrored midnight. Instead of water, it flows with reflections that have yet to occur. I kneel and see the image of an Earth healed—oceans breathing in pristine aqua, forests draped like emerald shawls over mountains no longer gashed by greed. My chest tingles. I slip my hands into the cool, illusionary current and lift a single droplet. It glitters with tomorrow. Once I return, that droplet will evolve into a panel of liquid crystal glass for skyscrapers, each pane converting pollution into sweet oxygen with every sunrise.

A hush settles. The lattice sky dims to a warm indigo. From the dusk emerges a colossal creature shaped like a snow-white manta ray, wings miles wide, its body stitched with constellations. It drifts just overhead, and when it exhales, galaxies scatter like dandelion seeds. I lock eyes with it—there is understanding but no language. It gifts me one translucent scale, the size of a teardrop. I sense it will become a canvas back home: paint upon it any feeling, and the emotion will flash briefly into the air as living, colored mist, letting everyone see exactly what the heart bears.

The dream trembles; dawn is tugging at the seams. I gather my treasures: the tower of absence, the ultraviolet note, the silver string of yet, the droplet of tomorrow, the manta scale of emotion. I press them against my heart. They melt into dust-lights and spiral into my bloodstream, promising to rematerialize when called upon.

The lattice sky splits, sunlight from the waking world knifing through. As I rise, I hear the invisible violin string snap back to silence.  

And then—

I am awake, lying in my bed, the dawn still gray outside. Yet my palms glow faintly, each particle of dream-dust swirling beneath my skin, waiting. Somewhere inside me, the unseen civilization’s tower murmurs with architecture; the ultraviolet note vibrates in my throat; the silver thread coils in my pocket; the droplet of tomorrow cools my pulse; the manta’s scale shimmers behind my eyes.

I breathe in once, twice, and smile—the day stretches ahead, and reality feels malleable, ready to be rewoven by everything I saw beyond dimension.
