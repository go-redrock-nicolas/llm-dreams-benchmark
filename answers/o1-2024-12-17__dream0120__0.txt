I am dreaming. You find yourself standing atop a grand marble portico, its sweeping columns shimmering with gold filigree under the fiery glow of a distant sun. Crystal chimes ring softly in the breeze, announcing your arrival to anyone who cares to listen. In this dream, you are the newly assigned diplomat to the kingdom of Zahavia—a place of austere grandeur, bound by unspoken codes and labyrinthine customs you can sense but don’t fully comprehend.

Everything here seems hewn from ancient rock and carved with intricate patterns that tell the stories of countless generations. Doors are not merely doors, but massive slabs of slate engraved with swirling lines that look like windblown dunes. Towers twist skyward, as though trying to touch invisible gods who alone know the secrets hidden within Zahavia’s proud spires. Sunlight filters through tinted glass mosaics, painting the narrow streets below in shards of emerald, amber, and rose. 

The people are a regal sight. They don long, layered robes of russet and sapphire, trimmed with copper thread that shimmers like the edges of a sunset. High collars brush cheeks, the very shape indicating rank and clan. You notice subtle differences in the layering of sashes—tiny motifs that speak volumes about their lineage and social position. Yet behind these outward signs of glory, there is a silent current of guarded caution, as though each passing word could alter your destiny.

You spend your first few days stumbling through the city, engrossed by the breathtaking architecture and the calm yet stringent code of politeness. Even the simplest gesture—hand over heart, bowing with eyes half-lowered—carries tremendous meaning. With every encounter, you try your best to observe the local protocol: a slight dip of the head to your superiors, a subtle turn of the palm to signal deference, all to maintain the precarious balance of honor.  

It is on your fourth night within these polished walls that you unwittingly commit the taboo, the weight of which you only realize seconds after it’s done. You are dining as the guest of a powerful official, seated in a candlelit courtyard bordered by flowering vines as white and delicate as moonlight. The official, a severe figure with opaline eyes, leads a conversation in hushed tones that sound almost musical in the twilight. Servants scurry around with polished crystal decanters, weaving in and out of the flickering amber glow. 

As a gesture of gratitude, you reach for an exquisite bowl filled with gleaming pearls of fruit. The moment your hand crosses an ornate golden tray, an audible gasp travels around the courtyard. To your surprise, the official’s expression grows stony, and the candles’ soft light seems to dim, as though the entire atmosphere is recoiling from your misstep. You quickly withdraw your hand, but the damage is done: you’ve taken food before the designated elder, breaking a centuries-old practice that demands he receive the first taste at any feast.  

The reaction is immediate and unnerving. The music stops. Your breath catches in your throat. The official sets his jaw, his gaze burning with a shock that borders on outrage. The other guests avert their eyes, turning slightly in their seats as if in silent rebuke. Even the servants, delicate porcelain cups in their trembling hands, glance at you with pity. You have breached the ancient codes that bind Zahavia together like invisible chains.

A wave of panic races through you, so powerful that for a moment the painted mosaic tiles beneath your feet threaten to swirl and dissolve. You’ve tried so hard to navigate this culture’s intricacies, but one tiny lapse has sent ripples that could topple your delicately balanced relationship here. 

Summoning what composure you can muster, you fall into a deep bow. Your forehead nearly touches the rim of a carved pedestal supporting a rare orchid with crimson petals shaped like curling vipers. You apologize, voice quavering as you attempt their formal tongue, weaving together bits of contrition and humility you learned from your brief lessons.  

When you finally dare to glance up, the official’s features have softened, if only a fraction. The hush lingers a moment longer, pressing down on you with the weight of a thousand unspoken rules. Then, with an imperious tilt of his chin, the official declares that you must undergo “Kharys-Dorahn,” a phrase you have never heard but whose solemn syllables seem to conjure a hush among the assembled guests.

The others nod gravely, their jeweled sashes rustling in unison. Whispers echo: “It is the only way…” Someone clutches your arm in a show of sympathy, as though the challenge ahead is both fearsome and necessary. You feel the gentle night's breeze stiffen like a portent, and the lantern lights flicker, as if the courtyard itself takes a collective breath.

The official taps an ivory baton lightly on the table, and a pair of ceremonial guards comes forward, their armor an elegant patchwork of burnished metal plates that reflect the dancing flames. They encircle you, neither threatening nor comforting—simply patient, watchful, awaiting instructions. You sense they are to guide you toward this unknown trial, an ancient custom that could imperil your status or even your life.

All you know is that, in this dream, you are bound by law and honor to accept. With heart thrumming in your chest and a million questions warring in your mind, you rise on unsteady legs and prepare to follow them, stepping into the hushed gloom of a corridor leading into the hidden recesses of the palace. You catch a final glance of the courtyard: the guests whispering, the official’s dark coat shimmering in torchlight, the orchard’s blossoms gently swaying in a breeze that feels like it comes from another world.

And so begins the Kharys-Dorahn—a test you must face, guided by flickering candles through a realm of ancient halls and labyrinthine commandments, uncertain if your next words, your next breath, or your next step may seal your fate in this kingdom of silent judgments. Yet, as you slip deeper into the heart of Zahavia’s palace, a curious resolve anchors within you—like a single candle flame in the pitch-black night—flickering but fierce, insisting you will emerge on the other side of dream and destiny, changed forever.
