I am dreaming. I am walking through a sprawling, neon-lit labyrinth of glass corridors and towers that twist like spiraled seashells. The air hums with a soft, turquoise-colored light. The path ahead splits into three directions: one glowing crimson, one shimmering silver, and one pulsating violet. I reach out and touch my fingertips to the crimson pathway. Instantly, visions flood my mind - two warring nations, their histories etched in the scars of their ancestors’ monuments. Their languages, though different, share roots in primordial gutturals and clicks. Traditional envoys have come and gone, their treaties unraveling like cheap thread. I feel a weight in my pocket – a small, obsidian stone, warm to the touch. When Iit, I see through the eyes of a child from each nation planting seeds in cracked earth. The roots grow, fusing underground. The next morning, twin saplings adorned with leaves that read "forgiveness" and "memory" stand joined. I pocket the stone and feel the air shift; the labyrinth’s walls now pulse with bioluminescent vines that bloom with every heartbeat. The path ahead now leads to an obsidian temple where two roaring dragons, scaled in their nations' colors, stand face to face. The dream ends as I realize the dragons’ tails are intertwined, submerged in the saplings' shadow.



**The Dream Continues...**  

You step forward, the obsidian stone still warm in your hand, and the labyrinth seems to inhale, the walls contracting as if alive. The air smells of petrichor and forgotten temples, a blend of anticipation and ancient ritual. The crimson path, now a river of liquid flame, courses beneath your feet, its heat not burning but kindling a strange, electric vitality in your veins. The silver path hums like a plucked string, its light so bright it carves shadows into sharp relief, while the violet path throbs like a heartbeat, its colors deepening and lightening as if breathing.  

The dragons before the obsidian temple are not monstrous but sorrowful, their scales cracked like parched earth yet gleaming with unshed tears. One’s wings are the deep crimson of dried blood, the other’s iridescent silver like moonlight on steel. Between them, the saplings’ roots snake upward, forming a lattice that binds their claws, each tangled tendril etched with glyphs that whisper stories of battles long past and love lost in the echoes of time.  

You raise the obsidian stone, and its surface mirrors the dragons’ eyes—golden with ages of grief and defiance—and you understand: they are bound not by hatred, but by an older, deeper kind of pain, a shared fear of annihilation from within. The stone begins to vibrate, not with anger or power, but with something tender, like a mother recalling her child’s first laugh.  

You place it at the dragons' conjoined tails. The moment it touches the earth, the glyphs on the roots erupt into cobalt flame, their words now not of war but of questions: *How does one mend what was never broken but buried? How do children learn to speak when their ancestors’ tongues are dust?*  

The dragons tilt their heads, unspoken truths sliding between them like a silent pact. Suddenly, scales flake away, revealing iridescent membranes beneath—memories of wings that once soared tandem, of shared feasts in valleys green with unity, of a time when their song was one melody, not a discordant shout.  

The labyrinth’s walls unfurl, transforming into a sky streaked with auroras. The dragons lower themselves, offering necks for you to thread the saplings’ leaves—forgiveness and memory—into braids. With every leaf woven, their colors bleed into the other: crimson merges into silver, silver into violet, until they shimmer like twin suns at dawn.  

The ground beneath you erupts in a symphony of growth—flowers with petals like parchment unfurl, inscribed with treaties never signed, laments turned to lullabies, maps where borders dissolve into rivers. A chorus rises, not from the dragons but from the roots themselves, singing in those primordial clicks and gutturals, harmonizing into a language that needs no translation.  

You wake clutching a single violet petal, its veins mapping star systems, its scent a memory of something ancient and still growing. The dragons’ song lingers in your bones, a reminder that even the deepest wounds are ecosystems waiting for the right seeds to take root.  

Somewhere, a child’s laughter cuts through the dawn. You know, without doubt, that somewhere else, another child is listening.
