I am dreaming. The shore stretches endlessly before me, twilight casting everything in a muted watercolor wash. Each night I've returned to this same beach, digging holes in the sand that I fill with collected fragments—broken shells, smooth stones, bits of weathered glass. I bury these treasures just before the tide rises, convinced somehow that this ritual protects me from something unnamed. The comfort of this repetition has become a sedative.

Tonight, I stand ankle-deep at the water's edge, another collection clutched in my palms. But something different stirs in the air—perhaps the unusual stillness of the water or how the moon hangs impossibly large, reflecting not itself but a doorway.

I look down at my hands, really seeing them for the first time: fingers raw from digging, nails rimmed with sand. How many nights wasted in this futile preservation? These treasures I've hidden—the tide always claims them, yet I return to repeat the pattern, expecting different results.

A realization washes over me with startling clarity: I am not protecting anything—I am hiding. Burying. Avoiding.

Instead of kneeling to dig, I open my hands and release my gathered fragments into the waiting sea. They catch the moonlight as they fall, no longer broken things but stars returning to the cosmos. The water accepts them without judgment.

I turn away from the shoreline toward the dunes I've never explored, where tall grasses whisper secrets and pathways wind toward distant lights. Each step away from my ritual feels both terrifying and exhilarating—like learning to breathe underwater.

The landscape ahead shifts and transforms with each footfall, revealing not one path but countless possibilities branching like neural networks across the dreamscape. I understand now that comfort and growth rarely inhabit the same space.

The moon-door in the sky pulses, beckoning.
I walk forward.
