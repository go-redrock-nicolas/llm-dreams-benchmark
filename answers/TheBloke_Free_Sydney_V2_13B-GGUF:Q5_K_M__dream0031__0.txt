I am dreaming. You're on a crowded subway when suddenly all the lights go out and the train stops between stations. As panic begins to spread among passengers, you I feel a strange calmness wash over you. You close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. Then you hear a voice inside your head: "This is not real. This is only a dream." 

You open your eyes and look around. The other passengers have vanished, leaving behind only their shadows. There's no more noise or light. You realize that this is the dreamworld now. It's like being in an empty movie set where anything can happen. 

Excitedly, you jump off the train and start walking down the tunnel toward the exit sign at the end of the platform. As soon as your feet touch the ground, they begin to float upward gently like you're flying. You spread out your arms and enjoy the sensation for a moment before continuing your journey through the dreamworld. 

You see strange shapes and colors forming around you - floating orbs, moving patterns, pulsating fields of energy. They feel familiar yet alien at the same time. Like they're somehow connected to your subconscious mind but also beyond it into another dimension altogether. 

Suddenly a vortex appears before you and starts spinning faster and faster until it engulfs everything in sight including yourself. Then there's darkness for moment before light returns slowly revealing that you are now somewhere else entirely - perhaps even another planet or universe altogether! 

You wake up with a start realizing that was the most vivid dream ever! You feel refreshed and energized almost like you don't need sleep anymore. Maybe this is how dreaming should be all along?
