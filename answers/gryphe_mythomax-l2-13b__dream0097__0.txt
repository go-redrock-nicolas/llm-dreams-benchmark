I am dreaming. It's a bright and sunny day, but suddenly the sky darkens and the air becomes heavy with tension. The earth begins to shake violently beneath our feet. Buildings sway back and forth, and people scream in terror. I look around, trying to understand what has happened. 

As I stand there, frozen with fear, a massive tidal wave rushes towards us from the horizon. It's bigger than anything I've ever seen before, towering over the buildings and swallowing everything in its path. The roar of the water is deafening, and the wind carries with it the scent of salt and fear. 

The crowd around me panics, pushing and shoving as they try to escape the approaching wave. I fight against the current of bodies, trying to find some semblance of safety. I realize that my only hope is to climb to higher ground. 

Running towards the nearest building, I frantically search for a way inside. The door is locked, but I am not deterred. With superhuman strength, I burst through the windows and climb up the stairs until I reach the roof. 

Looking out over the sea of chaos below, I am amazed to see the tidal wave looming even larger than before. It crashes into the buildings, reducing them to rubble. Boats are swept away like toys, and fires break out everywhere. 

Despite the devastation, I feel strangely at peace. As I stand there, watching the aftermath of the disaster unfold, I realize that I survived because I made a conscious choice to keep calm and face the danger head-on. 

Slowly, the dream begins to fade, leaving behind only the comforting sounds of my own breathing. I wake up, my heart racing, but grateful to have had the strength to weather the storm in my dreams.
