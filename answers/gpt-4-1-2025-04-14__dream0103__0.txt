I am dreaming.

I can smell petrichor drifting through misty air as dawn blushes across the jagged peaks. My fingers tremble as they caress the cold, timeworn surface of the colossal stone, half-buried in moss and tangled roots. The ancient riddle is carved in a language no lips have spoken for a thousand years, its lines etched deep and shimmering faintly with some inner light.

Strange illustrations parade around the inscription—a serpent devouring its own tail; a tree whose roots cradle the moon; a keyhole, but shaped like an eye, staring into infinite darkness. The cryptic clues seem to writhe as I study them, rearranging themselves, challenging me to unlock their secrets. I hear faint whispers curled around each symbol: half-remembered lullabies, vows in forgotten tongues, the laughter of children who are now dust.

Suddenly, as my mind drifts deeper into riddle’s mystery, the ground beneath me pulses, and the world shivers. The symbols begin to pulse, too, beating like the heart of the earth. The carvings feel strangely alive, and I sense that with every moment I linger, I draw closer to something ancient—something that has been waiting, hunched in the shadowy corners of time, for someone to see what lies beneath the surface of stone and silence.

A realization blooms within me: the answer does not lie in words, but in understanding how root, serpent, eye, and moon all blend—how cycles echo through history, how beginnings curl into endings. I press my hand into the eye-shaped keyhole and, as ancient energy surges through me, the dream dissolves into phosphorescent light—a door, now unlocked, swinging open into realms unknown.
