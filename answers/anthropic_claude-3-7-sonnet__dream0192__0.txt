I am dreaming. I float within a library without walls, where shelves of leather-bound certainties have been my sanctuary for years. Each book represents a belief I've held sacred: their spines straight, their pages unworn by doubt. The library has defined my understanding of the world, of myself—its architecture as familiar as my own reflection.

But tonight, something changes. 

A shimmer disrupts the air, like heat rising from summer pavement. From this disturbance emerge pages—thousands of them—swirling in a gentle cyclone. As they brush against my skin, each imparts a fragment of understanding that contradicts my carefully curated knowledge. Facts illuminate themselves in brilliant gold script, evidence materializes in photographs that cannot be denied, testimonials whisper in voices too authentic to dismiss.

The foundations shake. My cherished books begin to tremble on their shelves, their covers fading, text rearranging before my eyes. I reach for a particularly beloved volume—the cornerstone of my worldview—only to find its pages now filled with questions rather than the answers I'd relied upon.

My chest tightens. The ceiling of the library peels away, revealing not sky but infinite layers of possibility I had never considered. The revelation is both terrifying and exhilarating—like standing at the edge of a precipice while simultaneously discovering wings.

Tears form as I watch my library transform. The books don't disappear but metamorphose, their contents becoming richer, more complex, sometimes contradictory. What was once a simple sentence now fills pages with nuance. Where certainty stood, possibility now breathes.

I sink to my knees among reorganizing shelves, feeling both loss and liberation in equal measure. The ground beneath me is no longer solid but permeable, suggesting that even what I stand upon is subject to reexamination.

And then I realize: the library isn't collapsing. It's growing.
