I am dreaming. Slowly, very slowly, my consciousness begins to awaken within a dreamscape that is swimstroke-purple, the color of wisteria in the twilight. The air is filled with the symphony of whispers from a thousand Treescentians, tree-like creatures with diaphanous wings, who flutter playfully through the magenta-hued clouds. A gentle breeze, warm as a sigh, caresses my skin, leaving goosebumps in its wake, like the rivers of raindrops on a windowpane.

My heart begins to beat a little faster, not in fear, but anticipation, as the rhythm of my own blood becomes a drumroll to the melody of this strange world. I feel a prickling sensation at the nape of my neck, a precursor to the alphabet of goosebumps that dance down my spine. My eyes, now open, somewhen dilation, absorbing the dream's grandeur like a sponge.

Below me, a carpet of crimson clover stretches out, each flower luminescent, pulsing with inner light. They sway gently, creating ripples of color that seem to sing. I can feel the hum of their song resonating within me, a vibrant symphony that sets my nerve endings tingling. My breath hitches as I realize I am floating, my feet  up, still clad in my favorite pair of worn, brown leather boots, a stark contrast to the dream's ethereal palette.

A sudden gust of wind wraps around me, not cold, but exhilarating, like the first sip of hot chocolate on a winter's day. It carries with it the scent of wet earth and honey, a perfume that makes my lungs expand, greedy for more. I lift my arms, feeling the air lift me higher. My heart pounds against my ribcage, a steady cadence that mirrors the rhythm of the world spinning below.

Then, from the heart of the whispering Treescentians, a spotlight of sunlight breaks through, illuminating a form. It's a creature unlike any I've seen, reminiscent of a giant cat but for the ornate, iridescent feathers that adorn its body. Its eyes, twin pools of molten gold, meet mine. My heart skips a beat, then races on, driven by a force beyond my control. The creature tilts its head, an invitation, and I feel myself drawn towards it, navigating this new world with a sense of wonder and reckless abandon.
