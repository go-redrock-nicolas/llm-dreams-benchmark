I am dreaming. I find myself in a glass-walled conference room that seems to float among iridescent clouds, the furniture made of shifting smoke that somehow remains solid enough to touch. Across from me sits my mentor - but their face keeps morphing between different people who have guided me through life, never settling on one visage for more than a moment.

The air feels thick with unspoken words, like honey caught in my throat. Every time I try to speak, my voice emerges as shimmering butterflies that dissolve before reaching their ears. Their disappointment manifests as heavy raindrops that fall upward from the floor, each one containing a memory of times we agreed, now distorted and twisted.

The walls of the room pulse with our mounting tension, transforming from crystal clear to deep crimson and back again. Documents on the table between us rearrange themselves into origami creatures that scurry away when we reach for them. Every time I try to bridge the gap of understanding, the table stretches longer, pushing us further apart.

In the corners of the room, shadows gather like worried spectators, whispering in voices that sound like rustling autumn leaves. The ceiling begins to crack with thin lines that spell out words I can almost read - perhaps they're the truths we're both too afraid to speak.

My hands feel impossibly heavy as I try to gesture, weighted down by the responsibility of maintaining this relationship while standing firm in my convictions. The air shimmers with potential resolutions, but they drift just out of reach like soap bubbles in a breeze.

As the tension peaks, the entire room begins to slowly rotate, turning our perspective literally upside down. Perhaps this is what we both need - a complete shift in how we see things. But before any resolution can manifest, the dream begins to dissolve at the edges, like a watercolor painting left in the rain...
