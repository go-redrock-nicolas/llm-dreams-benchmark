I am dreaming. I see a vibrant, glowing path stretching out before me, surrounded by lush and tranquil gardens. The air is filled with the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers and the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze.

As I take my first step onto the path, a small voice inside my head whispers harshly, "You'll never make it to the end of this path; you're not good enough." I recognize the voice – it's my inner critic, the part of me that tends to amplify the negatives and diminishes my sense of self-worth.

In the dream, I visualize the critical voice as a small, dark cloud hovering above me. I pause and take a moment to acknowledge its presence but choose not to engage with its doubts and negativity. Instead, I focus on the beauty surrounding me and the purpose of my journey.

As I continue along the path, the dream unfolds into a series of challenges and opportunities for growth. With each step, I'm mindful not to let the inner critic's voice gain momentum. When faced with obstacles or perceived shortcomings, I pause and remind myself of my strengths and resilience.

Soon, I find myself at the end of the path, standing before a serene and breathtaking landscape. Looking back, I realize that by acknowledging and choosing not to give power to my self-critical voice, I was able to overcome the challenges and reach my destination.

As the dream begins to fade, I carry with me the lesson it imparted – that by recognizing my self-critical patterns and consciously choosing to focus on my growth and strengths, I'm better equipped to navigate life's challenges and embrace personal fulfilment.
