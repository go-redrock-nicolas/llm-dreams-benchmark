I am dreaming. You feel the coarse grit of golden sand beneath your bare feet, the grains shifting slightly every time you move. It’s not quite day. It’s not quite night. Instead, the sky is filled with a dazzling twilight—purples strewn with flecks of molten bronze swirling slowly, like the cosmos itself has been stirred in a great celestial pot. The air is thick with anticipation, and each breath you draw feels charged with potential. Far on the horizon stands a jagged mountain, its summit hidden by swirling clouds that crackle with pinpricks of lightning. This mountain is your final trial, a peak that stands tall as the gateway to your soul’s deepest yearnings. 

You’ve lost count of how many times you’ve tried to reach that peak. You remember previous attempts in jumbled fragments: precipitous cliffs that crumbled without reason, nights darker than ink where you navigated by hope alone, and storms of despair that nearly drowned you in swirling rain. Each failed climb left you bruised, both in body and spirit, chipping away at your resolve. Yet here you are again, determined—even if the mountain looms larger than any fear your mind can conjure. Despite your heart pounding like a drum in your chest, you step forward, guided by an inner voice that whispers, “One more time.”

With every step, the wind whips around you. At times it roars like a mighty beast trying to block your path, clawing at your clothes, swirling sand into your eyes. Your legs feel as though they’re made of iron, impossibly heavy, yet you keep moving. Barbed vines—seemingly lifeless at first—try to snare your ankles, testing your strength and resolve. But you slice through them with sheer will, each heartbeat echoing your newfound courage. 

As you begin to ascend, the mountain’s slopes transform beneath your feet, morphing from sand to slick obsidian and back again, shifting like a living puzzle trying to read your intentions. Lightning flashes across the swirling clouds overhead, illuminating a procession of shimmering constellations that dance across the sky. A warm brilliance washes over your soul in that split second of light—you almost feel weightless, your burdens melting into the starlit air.

Near the summit, you reach a ledge and exhale sharply. The wind dies to a gentle hush, as though the mountain itself is holding its breath. A narrow path stretches before you, carved into the living rock, glowing faintly as if endowed with moonlight. Every step you take ignites tiny tendrils of luminescence at your heels, marking your progress with an otherworldly trail. You sense the final obstacle looming just beyond this path, like a silent guardian waiting to measure the truth of your heart.

And then, you see it: a colossal stone gate guarded by two watchful gargoyles, their eyes glinting with ancient judgment. They stare at you, unblinking, as thunder grumbles in the distance. Your bruises, failures, and doubts pulse in your memory. Yet an unexpected warmth blossoms in your chest—a surging light that makes every previous attempt, every tear, every moment of despair crystallize into a bright, unwavering certainty. You have come this far, wrought from iron and tested by storms, and no force, no mountain, no final guardian, can extinguish your resolve now.

A sudden rush of wind rustles your hair, but this time you don’t flinch. Your hand touches the cold stone at the edge of the towering gate, and you rise onto the tips of your toes, poised to push it open. In that moment, you feel the chill of rock against your palms and the thrill of victory racing through your veins. The dream crackles with possibilities, and as you press forward, the gate groans with ancient protest. You breathe in the swirling twilight air one last time, feeling it pulse with your heart’s steady rhythm. In this final, breathtaking instant, you realize the dream has become your reality: You are no longer just climbing the mountain. You are becoming the mountain.
