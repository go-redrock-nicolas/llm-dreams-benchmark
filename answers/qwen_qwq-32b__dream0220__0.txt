I am dreaming. I start in a strange forest, with trees made of glass, shimmering in the twilight. There's a village ahead, where the inhabitants move in slow motion, their voices echoing like wind chimes. I approach, trying to greet them with a smile, but they recoil. Then I realize—they value anger as a sign of respect. A villager snarls at me, and I mimic the expression, which earns me nods of approval. But when I try to apologize after accidentally stepping on someone's foot, they look confused. "Why grovel?" they bark. "A good insult is worth ten apologies!" I experiment, muttering a sly joke at the next stumble, and the crowd laughs. Yet, deep down, my old self itches to say "I'm sorry"—how do I balance their customs with my true feelings?\n



In the heart of that crystalline forest, where sunlight fractures into rainbows with every breeze, I follow a path lined with luminous mushrooms that pulse like heartbeat lanterns. The villagers’ homes rise from the earth—delicate, fragile structures of ceramic and spider silk, adorned with brass knuckles and shattered teacups. Their leader, a woman with hair like live flames and skin etched with constellations, observes me with a smirk. "You’ve mastered the snarl, but your eyes still whisper sweetness," she says, her voice a crackling fireplace. To prove herself, she backhands a servant’s shoulder—gentle, but decisive—and the servant grins, shouting, *"Too weak! Strike harder next time!"* 

I try: my palm meets the servant’s arm with controlled force. He howls in exaggerated pain, clutches his limb dramatically, then bellows laughter. The crowd roars approval. Yet when night falls, I’m invited to a “grudge feast”—a ceremony where guests compete to hurl the most creative grievances at one another. The village chief skewers a roasted starling with a dagger and declares, "Your mother once mistook my masterpiece sculpture for litter!" The air thrums with witty venom, but my retorts feel stilted, my barbs blunt. A teenager nearby mocks me: *"Ouch. Did you borrow your insults from a toddler?"* The group titters, but I feel my cheeks flush, an insult to their culture. 

Later, in my silk-and-thorn-woven bedroom, I find a note pressed under my pillow: *"They’ll accept you only when you stop counting your old morals like loose coins. Burn their rules into your soul—or be cast out at dawn."* 

In the pre-dawn stillness, I step onto the village square, where the chief waits. She holds a mirror, its surface rippling like mercury. "Prove your transformation." I search inside, not for anger, but for the fiercest truth I carry—not fury, but defiance. I say, "Your village’s ‘courtesy’ is a labyrinth of thorns... but I’ll wear them all as a crown." The crowd gasps. The chief’s eyes narrow, then widen in raw admiration. "At last," she rasps, "a worthy adversary." 

As the sun rises, the forest’s glass trees ring like a choir. I’ve found a third way: not submission, not rebellion, but a mirrored dance of truth and theirs. Even the itching apology is now a weapon, sharp with authenticity—*"I’m sorry I cannot be softer,"* I declare, and they cheer, finally hearing my voice.
