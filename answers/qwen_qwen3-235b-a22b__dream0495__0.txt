I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The sky is a vast canvas of liquid mercury, rippling with reflections of memories you’ve never lived—scenes of ancient cities built inside hollowed-out trees, of oceans that flow upward into constellations, of a child weaving light into thread on a loom made of whalebone. You float above this world, tethered to nothing, your body a shadow that flickers like a candle. Below, the earth pulses with a heartbeat that thrums in your teeth. You descend, drawn by a hunger you can’t name.  

You land in a garden you once tended. Roses bloom here, but their petals are made of ash, crumbling to soot when you touch them. The fountain at the center spills not water but hourglasses, each grain of sand spelling out words you’ve forgotten how to read. You kneel, sifting the sand. It slips through your fingers, whispering *“Why?”* in a language of sighs. You used to know the answer. You planted these roses to honor your mother’s laugh, the fountain to mark the spot where you first confessed love to someone who later became a stranger. But now the rituals feel hollow, like prayers muttered to a god who stopped listening.  

A door materializes—a warped slab of oak, floating in the air, its handle forged from a serpent’s spine. You open it.  

Inside is your childhood bedroom, but the walls are lined with mirrors that don’t reflect you. Instead, they show versions of yourself you never became: a sailor gripping a compass that points only to storms, a monk painting mandalas on the inside of eyelids, a thief who steals memories and wears them like stolen clothes. You reach out to touch one mirror, and the surface ripples like black ice. A voice hums, *“You built your purpose on scaffolding you thought was stone. But the wind always comes.”*  

The room dissolves. Now you stand in a desert where the dunes are made of discarded clocks, their gears spilling like entrails. The sun is a blind eye, watching but not seeing. You walk for centuries, it seems, until you find a tree rooted in a pool of liquid starlight. Its branches hold fruit that glows like miniature suns, but when you pluck one, it turns to smoke in your hand. A figure emerges from the shadows—a woman with antlers made of origami, her skin a mosaic of cracked porcelain. She says nothing, only hands you a key carved from a rib.  

You unlock the hollow in the tree. Inside is a room smaller than a breath, yet infinite. It contains a single chair, a blank book, and a window overlooking a horizon that doesn’t exist. You sit. The book opens itself, and the pages are filled with questions you’ve never dared ask: *What if fulfillment is not a destination but a ghost you chase, only to find yourself the hunter? What if the act of yearning is the purpose, not the end of it?*  

Outside, the desert begins to bloom. Clocks melt into rivers, the fruit on the tree hardens into seeds, and the antlered woman vanishes like mist. You stay in the room, writing and un-writing, until the dream begins to fray at the edges.  

When you wake, your hands smell of starlight and ash. The questions remain.
