I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of crushed rose petals and amber, the walls of the sanctuary carved from iridescent crystal that hums with faint, healing vibrations. Around me, strangers sit cross-legged on cushions woven from starlight, their faces half-hidden by veils of liquid shadow that dissolve as they speak. Each voice cracks open like an egg, releasing memories that materialize as glowing scars above their palms—a twisted root for abandonment, a shattered mirror for betrayal, a wilted chrysanthemum for grief.  

When my turn comes, my hands tremble. The room stills. The scar rises not from my palm but my ribcage—a jagged fissure of obsidian, cold and sharp. As I speak of the night I stood barefoot in a November storm, screaming into a phone that had gone silent forever, the obsidian shudders. It fractures, revealing not blood or bone, but a swarm of ember-winged moths. They spiral upward, each carrying a fragment of the unspoken words, the unanswered *why*, until their wings dissolve into a constellation above us—a new pattern in the sanctuary’s ever-shifting cosmos.  

The others reach out, and their scars stretch like taffy, weaving with my moths to form a luminous bridge. Beneath it, a river of liquid mercury flows, swallowing the shadows we’ve shed. Someone begins to hum—a melody that tastes like salted caramel and thunder. The sanctuary’s crystals pulse in unison, and for the first time, the weight in my chest feels like belonging, not ruin.
