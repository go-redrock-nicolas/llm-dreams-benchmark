I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the heart of an impossibly vast library, though "library" feels too small a word for this cathedral of knowledge. Towering shelves of dark, polished mahogany spiral up into the misty heights above, stretching so far that the ceiling dissolves into a swirling cosmos of constellations that pulse with secret wisdom. The air hums with the weight of centuries, thick with the scent of ancient parchment and beeswax candles that flicker without melting.

Before me, an enormous lectern holds a book bound in what looks like starlight-silvered dragonhide, its pages rustling of their own accord as if alive. But as I reach out to turn a page, the letters detach from the paper like swarming fireflies, swirling around me in glowing golden constellations. I realize with dawning awe that I'm not just reading—I'm breathing in the knowledge. Each shimmering symbol I inhale blooms behind my eyes as vivid, living understanding: the birth cries of supernovas, the mathematical love songs of quantum particles, entire civilizations rising and falling in the space between heartbeats.

Yet as the flood of omniscience builds, the shelves begin to whisper. At first it's just the creak of old wood, but soon the murmurs coalesce into countless voices—each book humming with the memories of every reader who ever held it. Their joys, fears and epiphanies pour into me until I can no longer tell where my mind ends and the collective human experience begins. The candle flames flare emerald green, casting dancing shadows that form and reform into the shapes of everything I've ever forgotten—childhood dreams, half-formed ideas, that one perfect sunset I swore I'd always remember.

Just as the tidal wave of infinite knowing threatens to dissolve me entirely, I notice the librarian. An androgynous figure with skin like aged vellum and eyes that hold entire galaxies watches from a hovering balcony of floating dark matter. They extend a hand holding a single blank page that glows with potential. "Some truths," the stars whisper through their smile, "are written in the spaces between." And suddenly I'm falling upward, through the cosmic vault, into silent white radiance where all questions and answers are the same...
