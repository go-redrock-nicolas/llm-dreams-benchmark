I am dreaming. I step through a veil of silver mist and find myself standing at the edge of a forest, each tree’s bark a living mirror that trembles whenever I breathe. Moonlight drips in slow rivulets down the translucent leaves overhead, painting the air in opalescent hues. Every footstep sends ripples of color racing beneath my soles—emerald folding into sapphire, then melting into molten gold. A soft hum, like distant laughter or perhaps the forest’s own pulse, vibrates through my spine. Here, the world feels unfixed, as though reality itself is reciting a secret poem just for me.  

Up ahead, a handful of strangers gathers around a gleaming carnival carousel. Their laughter is crisp and metallic, while mine sounds like water spilling against glass. They see painted horses, bright and familiar, each crowned with a porcelain saddle. In my waking memories, I know they once told me, “It was just a merry-go-round.” But here, the horses arch and twist beyond their poles—silver manes streaming into the sky, hooves that leave sparks of violet flame on the grass. My heart thrills at their vertiginous beauty; the others nod politely, their smiles flat, as if they’ve glanced at a child’s toy.  

Suddenly, I’m swept upward on one of those fever-bright steeds. The carousel spins backward through time, and I glimpse the scene they claim they shared: a silent courtyard, dusty chairs under an awning, the setting sun dull as old coin. To them, the moment was dusty and still; but in my dream, the courtyard blossoms with streaming lanterns, each a firefly trapped in colored glass, drifting upward until the sky is thick with suspended light. I feel every lantern’s warmth on my cheek. They recall only shadows.  

Later, we gather around a low table set on a floating platform, glazed in midnight-blue lacquer that shimmers with embedded stars. We describe the same banquet: they remember bland bread, a single wilted rose at the center. In my mouth, the bread was baked of starlight and honey, its crust crackling like frost, and the rose unfurled petals of glowing opal, releasing scents of midnight jasmine. As I speak, I watch their brows furl—confused, skeptical. They taste none of that. The rose in their dream lay limp, color drained.  

I realize then that we have each threaded our own tapestry through the same moments. Where they saw dust, I saw dew. Where they heard echoes, I felt harmony. In the hush before waking, I hover between two worlds: one of delicate wonder, the other of muted certainties. And I wonder—if all our dreams diverge so wildly, what becomes of truth when we awaken? The forest mirrors shiver in answer, and in that trembling reflection I glimpse the possibility that every mind carries its own galaxy, alive and boundless. Then I wake, carrying only the memory of impossible colors and the knowledge that reality, like a dream, is endlessly reinvented the moment we open our eyes.
