I am dreaming. …inhale sharply, gravity seeming to shift as the words echo into a hush. The courtroom—if it is a courtroom at all—begins to blur and transform. Pillars of obsidian rise from a floor of shimmering glass, and the vaulted ceiling roils with clouds glowing with faint constellations, as if the night itself hangs over the proceedings. Seated to one side is the entity of Dawn, radiant in robes braided with gold and strands of the first light, eyes flickering like sparks at the horizon. To the opposite, Dusk reclines, robed in chiffon woven from twilight itself, cloaked in a scent of cooling earth and distant thunder.

Their dispute crackles in the charged silence. Dawn seeks to advance the boundaries of the day, to claim more hours for creation, for thriving, for illuminating every forgotten corner. Dusk pleads for rest, for secrets, for the gentle hush that nourishes dreams and lets old wounds heal unseen.

Their voices—morning birds against distant, rumbling stars—still resonate in the air as you rise from your obsidian bench, every step echoing across realities. The audience is a fantastic congregation: rivers wrapped in brides of mist, mountains stooped like gray-bearded sages, breezes clothed in swirling silks, and a lone fox with sunset burning on its fur, all waiting in breathless suspense.

You feel the impossible weight of this moment press upon you. Whichever way you turn, you sense the world will warp—a future unspooling in golden brilliance or slumbering under endless indigo. You lift your hand, feeling the gavel pulse with the beat of the universe: one side thrumming with new life, the other with peace and renewal. Your voice, resonant and somehow not your own, proclaims an unprecedented verdict: not in favor of one over the other, but a weaving of the two—a great tapestry where day learns from night and night finds comfort in the embrace of dawn.

As the entities listen, the room blazes with colors never before seen, blazing jade and silent violets, and suddenly, you are swept into a feeling of motion—like tumbling through seasons at the speed of thought. Your ruling radiates lines of symmetry through creation itself, and as you awaken, the taste of starlight lingers on your tongue and somewhere, quietly, you know that the world is forever changed.
