I am dreaming. As the dream begins, I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering lake, its surface a perfect mirror reflecting a twilight sky streaked with hues of lavender and molten gold. The air is thick with the scent of blooming night flowers, their fragrance intoxicating, pulling me deeper into this surreal world. I can feel a bittersweet pang in my chest, a quiet ache I recognize as the slow, inevitable drift from old friends—those companions who once walked alongside me through the chapters of my life, but whose paths have now begun to veer in directions I can no longer follow.

I sense this separation not as a sharp cut, but as a gentle unraveling, threads of shared laughter and late-night confessions slipping through my fingers like gossamer. In this dreamscape, the disconnect manifests as a series of floating islands hovering just above the lake’s surface, each one glowing with a faint, ethereal light. Each island represents a friend, a memory, a piece of a Once Was. I see their faces in the mist above the islands—smiling, distant, fading as the islands drift further apart, carried by an unseen current.

I step forward, my bare feet touching the cool, glassy water, and to my surprise, I don’t sink. Instead, the lake supports me, rippling outward in concentric circles of silver light with each step I take. I’m drawn to the nearest island, where I see my childhood best friend, Ellie. Her island is a miniature forest of willow trees, their drooping branches heavy with tiny, glowing fireflies. As I approach, I hear her laughter echoing from years past, the sound of us racing through sunlit fields with grass-stained knees. But when I call out to her, my voice is swallowed by the wind, and the island begins to drift away, the fireflies dimming as if mourning the growing distance.

Determined not to lose them all, I quicken my pace across the lake, chasing after another island, this one belonging to Marcus, a friend from my reckless teenage years. His island is a jagged cliff of obsidian rock, streaked with veins of crimson that pulse like a heartbeat. I can almost feel the thrum of the music we used to blast in his beat-up old car, the taste of cheap soda on my tongue as we drove nowhere just for the sake of moving. But as I reach out, the cliff crumbles at the edges, pieces falling into the lake with a sound like breaking glass. Marcus’s shadowy figure stands at the top, looking back at me with a wistful smile before turning away, disappearing into a haze of red mist.

My heart grows heavier with each failed reunion, but I refuse to give up. The lake stretches endlessly before me, and I run now, the water splashing into glittering arcs around my feet. I chase after more islands—Sophie’s garden of oversized, vibrant blossoms that whisper secrets in voices too soft to hear; Jamal’s desert of golden sand where mirages of our college debates shimmer and dissolve. Each time, I’m too late, the islands slipping just beyond my grasp, carried away by that relentless, invisible tide.

Suddenly, the sky above darkens, the twilight deepening into a velvet indigo pierced by a thousand stars. The lake begins to churn, waves rising like the breath of some ancient beast. I stop, breathless, and realize I’m no longer alone. From the farthest reaches of the lake, a massive, translucent figure emerges—a being of water and light, its form shifting between human and something otherworldly. It speaks in a voice that resonates in my bones, a chorus of all the voices I’ve ever loved. “You cannot hold what is meant to flow,” it says, and though its words are gentle, they pierce me with a truth I’ve been running from.

Tears stream down my face, mingling with the lake beneath me, becoming part of its endless expanse. I understand now that this drift, this disconnection, isn’t a loss but a transformation. My friends aren’t gone; they’ve simply become part of a larger current, their essence woven into the fabric of who I am, even as our paths diverge. The watery figure reaches out, and I feel its touch as a wave of warmth, a reminder of every shared moment, every unspoken goodbye.

As I let go of my desperate chase, the islands stop drifting. They glow brighter, their lights connecting in a constellation across the lake, a map of memories that will never truly fade. I sit on the water’s surface, surrounded by this shimmering web, and feel a profound peace settle over me. The ache in my chest softens, replaced by gratitude for the time we had and the courage to let each other grow.

The dream begins to dissolve, the lake rippling into nothingness, the stars above winking out one by one. But as I drift back toward waking, I carry with me the image of that constellation—my friends, my past, my heart—etched forever in the deepest parts of my soul.
