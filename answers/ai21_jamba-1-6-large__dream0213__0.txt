I am dreaming. I am dreaming, there is a government official with a clipboard who is supervising the equipment operations. We are in a Gothic cathedral. There is a ceiling made of stained glass depicting a cosmic explosion. The air is filled with tension and urgency. The official always looks dissatisfied with the progress of the work. I switch between languages fluently and never tire. The equipment is complex and unfamiliar, with glowing screens and intricate keypads. The stakes feel high. 

The dream feels so vivid that it borders on reality.
