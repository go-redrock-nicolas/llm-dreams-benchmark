I am dreaming. I'm in a place where everyone can express themselves freely and without fear of judgment or rejection. It's a world where emotions are not just words but actions too. Here people don't need to speak at all because their bodies do all the talking for them. They use gestures, postures, facial expressions, even sounds instead of language to convey meaning clearly and effectively.
