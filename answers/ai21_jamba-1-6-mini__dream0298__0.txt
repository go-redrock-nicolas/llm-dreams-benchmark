I am dreaming. Yes, you are dreaming. Now imagine a vivid dream where you suddenly find yourself walking through a dense forest at dusk. The trees, adorned with glowing leaves of amber and crimson, seem to stretch endlessly in every direction, their trunks forming a labyrinth of silent guardians. The wind carries the faint scent of pine and earth, and as you walk, the ground beneath your feet transforms into a carpet of leaves that crunch softly with each step.

Unexpectedly, you hear the sound of a distant melody—a haunting tune that you can’t quite place. Curiosity draws you deeper into the forest, following the sound. The forest seems to shift around you, the trees growing closer together, their leaves glowing brighter as the light fades.

You come across a small, clear pond. The surface is smooth as glass, reflecting the soft, golden glow of the forest's lanterns. As you bend to touch the water, it murmurs back, as if alive. The melody grows louder, more distinct, and a faint figure appears on the other side of the pond. It is a shadow, indistinct yet somehow familiar, beckoning you closer.

You step into the water, which is unexpectedly warm and soft, like stepping into a cloud. The surface caresses your skin, and you feel weightless, floating toward the figure. The pond becomes a portal, and as you pass through, you find yourself in a grand library.

Rows upon rows of shelves stretch out before you, each laden with books containing untold stories. The air is thick with the scent of old parchment and ink. The shadow figure reappears, now more defined, and you recognize it as a younger version of yourself, looking at you with open, longing eyes. You approach and the books begin to glow, each turning its pages as if by wind.

The shadow lifts its hand, and you hold it. The room fades, and you wake up in a soft, warm bed. The dream lingers in your mind, leaving you with a deep sense of peace and an unusual compassion for yourself, like a leaf caught in a gentle, unseen current.
