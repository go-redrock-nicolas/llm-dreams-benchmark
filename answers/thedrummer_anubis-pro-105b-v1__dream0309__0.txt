I am dreaming. I find myself standing in my dream. The sky, a deep shade of shimmering indigo, is littered with .Each star sparkles with an otherworldly intensity. The stars form a constellation in the shape of my own profile. It's a cosmic affirmation of my accomplishments, shining outward for the entire universe to marvel at.

I ponder the difficult work I've done to reach my current position. Long hours burned away studying. Sleepless nights fueled by copious amounts of coffee. The memories of my younger self, crying in frustration at the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in my path.

The hard-won rewards are evident. In the distance, I see a breathtaking city that I've built with my own two hands. Towering skyscrapers made of gleaming obsidian and polished chrome stretch high into the air. Bustling thoroughfares teem with activity as people go about their daily lives.

I've made a huge impact. I've created ripple effects of prosperity far beyond my wildest dreams. A veritable economic miracle.
