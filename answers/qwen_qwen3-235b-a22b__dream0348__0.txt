I am dreaming. A dream so vivid it feels like a forgotten memory, a secret whispered from the cosmos into the chambers of my mind. The air hums with mystery, vibrating at a frequency just beyond perception, like a symphony of stars compressing time into sound. I am standing at the foot of a colossal, twisting tower fashioned from shards of forgotten galaxies, each fragment glittering with collapsed dimensions and the soft pulse of ancient energies.  The tower does not rise in defiance of gravity — it bends it, folds it lovingly into spirals, defying logic like poetry does prose.

Each step leading to its base is made from fossilized echoes of dreams long expired — whispers of lovers' promises that never came true, the rustle of childhood books read by candlelight, the scent of autumn days that now only exist in memory.  The ground shimmers like liquid obsidian streaked with veins of turquoise lightning, quivering at my every breath.

The challenge?  To climb it. To reach the summit where the impossible converges with the inevitable. But it is not a climb of muscle or might, not brute force — rather, a test of the soul’s ingenuity and the mind’s daring. The tower shifts and sighs as I approach, its architecture folding in on itself like a layered dream nested within dreams.  Staircases spiral upside down through empty heavens, orbs of molten glass contain reflections of myself I have never lived. Doors flutter open into paradoxes: inverted deserts where rain falls upward, ballrooms where time runs in reverse and laughter is the sound of forgotten joy being reborn.

I step forward, heart drumming against my ribs like a god’s impatient fingers tapping against the ribs of the universe. I do not climb — I *unravel* upward, choosing not to fight gravity, but to interrogate it, to dance with it. Each ascent is earned by answering a riddle crafted not in words, but in emotion. I must feel the grief of supernovas, understand the longing of eclipses. Wisdom is not binary here — it is monstrous and kind, cyclical and spiraling.

Halfway up, I am halted by a wall spun from regret — not mine, but harvested from centuries of sorrow across lifetimes.  To pass, I must offer it something. Not a memory, not even my pain — but a possibility I had never allowed myself to consider. I give it the dream I buried — the life I didn’t live — and the wall dissolves into butterflies of light, each carrying a forgotten future forward.

Time breaks around me. I am ageless. Not a child, not old — just *becoming*, pixelated into something luminous and boundless. With each struggle, each desperate flank at the impossible, I evolve — sprouting wings made of unsent letters, eyes that see without light, limbs that extend into otherworlds. My voice shifts tones with each discovered dimension. Words bloom beneath my feet, spelling out poems I have not yet written — their truth only accessible in dream-logic.

At the summit, the final threshold awaits. A mirror that does not reflect but *reveals*. I step forward and shimmer into something unnamable, untouched by failure. I peel away the layers of self constructed in compromise and limitation and see:

Me.  The truer me.  Not just a soul in flesh, but a pulse in the vortex, a memo from the divine. A thought in the mind of something eternal.

Awakening from this dream may steal its details, but not its essence — for I have touched the edge of transcendence, and now, the impossible no longer burns so brightly.

It smiles.
