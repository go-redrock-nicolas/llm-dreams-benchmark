I am dreaming. You stand at the precipice of a vast canyon, the wind howling through its depths as if whispering forgotten secrets. Below, a river of molten gold snakes through the rocky gorge, casting a shimmering glow into the night sky. You feel the weight of a small, ancient book in your hands – its leather worn, its pages tinged with age.
The book opens itself, defying gravity, and ink-black letters begin to crawl across the pages like living shadows. As they move, the text forms a single sentence: "Your history has been written in lies."

A silhouette appears on the far ledge of the canyon. Though barely visible, their presence is commanding. They raise a hand, and a beam of azure light pierces the dark. The light reaches into your chest, cold yet gentle, unlocking a torrent of emotions you've unknowingly buried.

Your heart races, and the canyon around you shifts – the walls pulse like living flesh, the wind becomes a cacophony of distant screams and whispers. The molten river beneath you rises, forming figures – ghostly echoes of people you've never met yet somehow know.

"Who are they?" The wind answers you, each gust whispering fragments of their story – betrayal, heartbreak, secrets buried to protect you. They claw at the border of your understanding, each name and deed demanding recognition.

But you stand unyielding. Your breath steadies, and a calm determination takes root. The figures in the river surge towards you, their voices crescendoing – yet their fury cannot penetrate your resolve.

"I will face this," you declare, hands gripping the ancient book tighter. "I will find the truth, but I will do it on my terms."

The canyon fades, and you're enveloped in pure white light. You're floating now, a sense of peace washing over you. A soft voice, tender and loving, speaks directly into your mind: "You have strength beyond knowing."

As the dream fades, you hold onto the book and its promise of revelation, ready to face whatever truths lie ahead.
