I am dreaming. I am dreaming—  
and the dream itself is a round-table, a breathing, many-sided jewel suspended in velvet dark.

The table is not wood or metal; it is made of slow-moving moonlight that ripples each time someone speaks, sending silver rings across an endless lake below. Around it sit twenty beings, none quite alike. One wears a suit stitched from newspaper headlines that flutter whenever he clears his throat. Another is a girl woven from piano wire; her ribs hum chords every time her heart beats. A scholar fashioned of cracked terracotta leans forward, bits of clay flaking like autumn leaves. In the highest chair, a translucent grandmother drifts, sewn of vapor and lullabies. Off to one side, a boy carved of shadow almost disappears entirely whenever loud voices crash into the air.

My role—the Facilitator of Dreams—shimmers in my palms like liquid opal. I stand, or perhaps I hover, halfway between presence and absence. Above us spins a canopy of constellations that rearrange themselves into punctuation marks—question marks, commas, em-dashes—reminding everyone that sentences can pause, curve, or completely change direction.

First, the newspaper man begins. Headlines flap open; his voice cracks like gunfire and rattles across the night-lake. The chords in the piano-wire girl recoil under the noise, the terracotta scholar’s fissures widen, and the shadow-boy grows dangerously thin. The discussion is tipping into orbit around the loudest planet.

I raise my hands and pluck from the sky an enormous hourglass made of glassy starlight. Its sand is not sand but tiny glowing syllables—whole alphabets gently cascading. I turn the hourglass over and decree, “All tongues will flow for only a single breath of stardust; when the last letter falls, yield.” The moonlight table absorbs the rule, and the newspaper man’s booming front-page declarations shrink to column inches.

Yet there are still those who sink into quietude. So I summon the Lattice of Listening: a web spun from spider-silk echoes. It drops onto the gathering, and every thread vibrates the exact decibel of the last unheard voice. Wherever a person’s contribution has been missing, the web sends out a warm gong that sounds like a temple bell muffled in velvet. It tolls behind the shadow-boy. All heads swivel toward the gentle knell. I kneel so my gaze meets his ember eyes. “Your silence is a continent. Map it for us.”

He whispers, and his words are small sailboats launched onto the silver lake: stories of places where daylight is a rumor and trust, a seed that might sprout if someone chooses to water it. The sailboats catch a wind of attention, and suddenly the entire circle leans his way, filling his quiet harbor with lantern-light.

Next the piano-wire girl. Her chords tremble with reluctance—her music has always been drowned by drums. I pull from my pocket a tuning fork forged from pure comprehension. When I strike it, the note is not pitch but empathy; it resonates inside rib cages, rearranging each listener’s heartbeat until they thrum in harmonic readiness. She finally sings—her voice luminous silk ribboning through the atmosphere—and the newspaper man’s pages turn themselves into soft origami swans to carry her melody.

Conversation blooms like night-flowers releasing perfume only when they’re sure someone will breathe it in. The terracotta scholar shares fissured wisdom; the grandmother of vapor offers lullabies that double as policy proposals; even the previously dominant speakers discover their own stillness is an instrument, and they practice the art of pausing until a hush is no longer awkward but sacred.

To close, I conjure an ink-black pool at the table’s center. One by one, each participant drops a single spoken star—a distilled phrase, a vow, a hope—and the pool begins to spin, weaving every utterance into a tapestry of liquid constellation. When the last star drops, the pool reflects a sky we’ve never seen before: a future assembled from plural brilliance rather than singular glare.

I address them in dream-language, which tastes like pomegranate seeds and dawn air:

“Remember this round table of moonlight. Out there, beyond the dream, you will sit at desks, in classrooms, on commuter trains, in boardrooms smelling of old coffee. Keep the hourglass, the listening web, the tuning fork. Tilt them into the waking world. Let space be made, let voices be scaffolded, let silence invite rather than erase.”

The canopy-punctuation in the sky arranges into one final mark: an ellipsis.

I awaken with starlight still clinging to my fingertips, the echo of many voices—now equal, now heard—rustling through the morning like pages turned by wind.
