I am dreaming. The air around me shimmers like liquid gold, and I feel weightless, as if floating in a sea of warm light. The world around me is both familiar and strange—an uncanny fusion of my childhood neighborhood and a landscape woven from pure emotion. The trees sway to an unheard symphony, their leaves rustling in hues of sapphire and emerald.

Then, I see *her.* A woman—or perhaps a being just beyond human—kneeling beside the roadside where a wounded bird trembles. Her presence radiates an almost divine kindness, luminous as the dawn. She murmurs soft, wordless sounds, and her hands glow faintly as they cradle the creature. The bird’s broken wing mends with threads of golden light, knitting together as though time itself bends to her will. 

But it’s not the miracle that shakes me—it’s the tenderness in her eyes. She strokes the bird’s feathers with such reverence, as though it were the most precious thing in the world. And in that moment, something cracks open inside me. A longing so vast it steals my breath. 

As I watch, she lifts the bird skyward, and it takes flight—not with frantic flaps but in slow, deliberate arcs, as if the air has turned to liquid grace. The bird circles once, twice, before vanishing into the gleaming horizon.

Tears blur my vision, but I don’t wipe them away. Instead, I kneel right where I stand, pressing my palms to the earth beneath me. The ground hums in response. A whisper rises from the soil, the voices of a thousand unseen lives—ants, roots, buried seeds—all singing in fragile harmony. 

I understand, then. The act wasn’t just healing. It was *seeing.* A recognition of worth in the small, the broken, the overlooked. 

When I wake, the dream lingers like honey on my tongue—sweet and thick with meaning. My hands still tingle, as if they remember the warmth of that impossible light. And I know, with quiet certainty, that I will carry this with me into the waking world: a fierce and tender resolve to *see,* truly see, the fractured beauty in everything.
