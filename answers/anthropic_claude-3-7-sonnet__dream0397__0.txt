I am dreaming. # The Siren's Canvas

I find myself repeatedly drawn to a paintbrush, though I've never studied art formally. The compulsion is inexplicable—like a whispered command from somewhere beyond conscious thought. Each morning, I wake with colors swimming behind my eyelids and phantom sensations of bristles between my fingers.

Today, I surrender to the pull. In a small art supply store tucked between a laundromat and a café, I purchase canvas, paints, and brushes. The shopkeeper studies me with knowing eyes, as though recognizing something I cannot yet see in myself.

At home, I set up by a window where the afternoon light spills across the floor like liquid gold. The blank canvas intimidates me at first—a void demanding to be filled with something meaningful. My hands tremble slightly as I squeeze prismatic ribbons of paint onto a wooden palette.

When brush finally meets canvas, something extraordinary happens. My hands move with surprising confidence, guided by some hidden intelligence. Colors blend and separate, forms emerge and dissolve. I paint for hours, losing all sense of time and self. The room darkens around me, but I barely notice, entranced by what's unfolding before me.

What appears is not technically perfect—proportions slightly askew, perspective somewhat distorted—yet it pulses with undeniable life. A landscape unlike any on Earth: violet mountains beneath twin moons, forests of crystalline trees, and in the distance, shadowy figures that seem to move when viewed from the corner of my eye.

As I complete the final stroke, exhaustion crashes over me. But beneath the fatigue lies a profound sense of rightness, as though I've finally answered a question I didn't know I was being asked.

I dream of this painting in my sleep, and within that dream, I step through the canvas into the world I've created, where those distant figures turn to welcome me home.
