I am dreaming. The air is thick with tension, like heavy fog lingering between two towering oaks.  My fingers twitch against the uneven bark of the tree I'm leaning against, their texture sharp and real under my touch.  I can feel the mist clinging to my skin, cool and insistent, each breath a shiver down my spine.

Across the meadow, Sarah and Mark are standing rigidly, their bodies language screaming the unsaid.  Sarah's hair is wild, a storm of chestnut strands whipping around her face as she gestures wildly.  Her voice carries, raw and frayed at the edges - "You promised!"  Her words are daggers, each a shard of broken glass skittering across the grass.  Mark is paler than moonlight, his jaw clenched so tight his cheeks hollow.  "Promises are meant to be broken!" he snaps, his tone brittle.  A flash of certainty in his eyes - *(They've done this before.  Many times.)*

The wind stutters.  For a heartbeat, time dissolves into liquid gold.  Sarah's hand reaches out, trembling, her index finger extended like a plea.  Mark's retort is swallowed by the sudden silence.  They both turn to me, their expectant gazes slicing through the air.

The choice feels monstrous, alive and writhing in my gut.  My throat contracts.  There is no right answer here.  To choose side in a war that's already raged too long would be to splinter myself into a million fragments.  The trees shiver with the depth of the moment, their leaves trembling in a department of stillness that's somehow louder than screams.

I step forward, my boots sinking into the dew-damp earth.  As I approach, the air churns with possibility - storm clouds brewing in the distance, flowers blooming overnight in summer's sudden mercy.

"Love isn't about who's right," I say, and somehow it's both the simplest and most devastating truth.  My own voice sounds like a stranger's, but the words resonate like a bell struck deep beneath the earth.  "It's about who's willing to stay.  Even when the foundation shakes."

Sarah's eyes glisten, her anger dissolving like sugar in rainwater.  Mark swallows, his shield of defiance cracking like a boulder struck by lightning.  Between them, a fragile bloom unfurls - not a rose, but something pale and luminous, maybe a ghost orchid.

They reach for each other simultaneously, their hands colliding like earthquake tremors.  The orchid trembles, its petals quivering.  Their laughter is sudden and sharp-edged, a blade that somehow feels like healing.

I back away, watching them embrace. The ground beneath me shifts - not into solid earth, but into a river of liquid light.  I don't fight the fall, trusting the current to carry me where I need to go. The last thing I see before tumbling into the abyss is Sarah's whisper - "Thank you," and Mark's answering nod, his eyes crinkling with something like awe.

Then I'm falling, not through air or water, but through infinite starlight.  And somewhere in the distance, the selvemidtunr of
