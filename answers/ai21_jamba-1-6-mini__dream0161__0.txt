I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You find yourself suspended in the eye of a mystical aurora, high above a mountainous realm cloaked in an otherworldly winter. The air is crisp and laden with the faint, sweet scent of snow-covered pines, while the sky above you dances with shifting ribbons of green, violet, and electric blue light. The world around you is hushed, save for the soft whisper of the wind carrying the tiniest of snowflakes like silken whispers.

As you venture forward, the scene below you transforms. A vast, intricate ice palace rises majestically from the snowy landscape, its spires and walls chiseled with intricate, glowing patterns that reflect the aurora above.
