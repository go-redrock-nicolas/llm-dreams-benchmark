I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast library that stretches infinitely in all directions. The shelves rise impossibly high, disappearing into a swirling cosmos overhead where galaxies and nebulae replace the ceiling. Each book glows with a soft luminescence, their spines inscribed with symbols that shift and change as I look at them—sometimes appearing as familiar text, sometimes as patterns I somehow understand without reading.

The air feels charged with potential, thick with the scent of ancient paper and something else—perhaps knowledge itself. As I move forward, my footsteps echo strangely, sometimes sounding immediately underfoot, sometimes returning seconds later as if traveling vast distances.

I notice my hands are translucent, glowing with the same light as the books. When I reach toward a particularly compelling tome bound in midnight blue, my fingers pass through several volumes before somehow extracting exactly the one I intended to touch. Opening it reveals not pages but windows into moments—some from my own life, others from lives I've never lived but somehow recognize.

I reach for the pen as the library dissolves into particles of light that swirl around me, carrying me upward toward consciousness, but not before I glimpse the first words appearing on the page without my having written them: "The meaning was always in the creating..."
