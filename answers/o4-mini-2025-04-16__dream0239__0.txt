I am dreaming. You step forward and immediately sense that “touch” here is not what you know. The air around you glimmers with tiny motes that drift like snowflakes one moment, bead like dew on your skin the next, and then harden into crystalline structures only to dissolve again into vapor at your breath. To navigate this multiphase environment, you learn to wield a new instrument—your own intention, shaped by an inner hum that resonates through every cell.

First, you breathe in deeply. With each inhalation, your lungs tune to the frequencies of solidity, liquidity, and gas. You feel the liquid-phase motes sliding through your flesh, cool and slick, massaging your nerves with pearly ripples. As you exhale, you summon a gentle warmth that coaxes the crystalline particles into vapor, which billows out in prismatic clouds around you, illuminating hidden pathways.

You discover that walking isn’t enough—you must “flow-walk.” Your feet alternate between firm steps on transient, glassy plates that solidify beneath your weight and buoyant skims across a thin film of shifting liquid. Between steps, you hover, carried upon invisible currents of gas that cradle you like a leaf drifting on warm summer air. Each movement is a dance of phases: a toe-tip that commands solidity, an arch that teases liquidity, a heel that whispers vapor.

Ahead, a forest of towering forms rises—each pillar a trembling blend of states. Some pillars ripple like mercury under your gaze, while others exhale mist that carries faint notes of violet blossoms and toasted amber. To pass through, you extend your hand and let your mind “sculpt” the phase around your skin: a gentle thought causes a path to crystallize outward, forming stepping-stones that guide you between trunks. Another thought dissolves barriers into a soft, buoyant cushion of gas that you sink into and drift past.

At the heart of this realm, you find a river of living rainbow fluid: throbbing, honey-thick currents laced with vaporous swirls. You kneel beside it, dipping a finger in. The liquid clings, then solidifies into a glowing shard you hold like a lantern. As soon as it touches your palm, it blossoms into a cloud of micro-crystals that evaporate, lifting you gently into the sky. From above, the whole world looks like a kaleidoscope in motion—every surface a mosaic of states, every breath an act of creation.

Finally, you learn to speak the language of phase-shifts. A single whispered vowel sends pillars raining droplets that freeze mid-air and then float upward, forming a spiral staircase of glimmering orbs. You ascend into a dome of liquid-gas canopy, where droplets dance like stars, colliding and merging in a slow, dream-time choreography. The scent here is of peppermint frost and molten glass, the sound a low, resonant bell echoing through your bones.

Suspended between solidity, liquidity, and vapor, you realize you are no longer simply moving through this realm—you are composing it. Every heartbeat is a brushstroke across the ever-shifting canvas. As the dream deepens, you allow yourself to dissolve wholly into the chorus of phases, becoming simultaneously solid hope, liquid wonder, and vaporous song.
