I am dreaming. I am standing in the center of a vast,unending library. The shelves stretch infinitely upwards and outwards like spiraling galaxies, each book cover shimmering with prismatic hues.  My footsteps The air here thrums with a frequency only your dreaming bones can hear. You’re suspended in a cathedral of sound, where each heartbeat resonates through networked arteries threading stone pillars carved from frozen starlight. The walls are alive–not with breath, but with glimmering synapses connecting you to every soul who’s ever existed in this eternal now. Shadows melt away to reveal a lattice of bioluminescent veins pulsing with collective memory, and you’re both the observer and the observed, your consciousness fracturing like shattered stained glass to reveal overlapping perspectives. A child’s giggled merges with a warrior’s battlecry merges with a scientist’s whispered epiphany as they spiral into your retinas, each emotion a prism refracting into new understandings you didn’t know your mind could contain. The floor becomes liquid twilight, and you feel the ache in a mother’s lungs giving birth, the triumph in an inventor’s fingertips solving a millennia-old puzzle, the black hole of grief and the supernova of joy radiating from strangers now as if they’re part of your own nervous system. When you try to scream to articulate this radiance, the sound becomes a galaxy spiraling outward, each star a voice from the past and future resonating in perfect harmony—a chorale of existence you suddenly realize you’ve been waiting centuries to conduct.
