I am dreaming. The world around me is a vast, circular chamber, unlike anything of this earth—a place where thoughts take form and echo endlessly. The walls shimmer like glass yet are warm to the touch, pulsing softly with shades of crimson and indigo, as if synchronizing with the energy of those within. We sit in a perfect circle—twelve or thirteen of us—on floating chairs suspended in the air, weightless. Vaporous light swirls above us, forming shapes that shift with every spoken word: spirals for the wise, jagged lines for the angry, blinking stars for the nervous.

Everyone else speaks with conviction. A chorus of voices rises, perfectly synchronized, nearly hypnotic in rhythm.

But they’re wrong.

I can feel it deep inside me, the quiet hum of truth that they’ve ignored. Their opinion, gathered like a storm cloud, blocks the reality I clearly see—a truth anchored in translucent knowledge shaped like ancient runestones, glowing softly to me alone. I consider voicing the thought I carry, but the mere idea causes ripples in the air, like the chamber itself is testing my resolve.

A creature appears in the corner of the room—a small, violet-skinned fox with wings. It sits beside my chair and peers up at me with luminous gold eyes. A whisper forms in my mind, not aloud but within: *"What do you have to say?"*

Its presence emboldens me. I inhale deeply, feeling the air shift. Some of the glowing forms above begin to flicker in anticipation, like the dream itself is watching, curious.

No one has noticed my internal battle yet, their argumentive rants keeping them blinded to the shift inside of me. I feel it now, the pressure rising in my chest—not anger, but something more like clarity fighting to break free. I ball my hands into fists, draw breath like ocean waves filling ancient caverns, and I speak.

There is no sound at first, just silence that stretches unnaturally, like time folding in on itself in shock. The air quivers. My voice emerges not thunderous, not straining, but precise like a single beam of sunlight piercing through fog. I say what needs to be said—not to oppose, not to be seen, but because it must be heard.

The chamber responds.

The floating chairs rock slightly. The swirling vapor above my head condenses into a sweeping constellation, an intricate map forming only above me. A hush falls upon the others, confused yet mesmerized.

In this dream, my voice has color. It weaves tapestries in the air—threads of radiant blue with golden edges that ripple and glow. They hang in midair for all to see. I talk not against them, but to the emptiness in their words, and the dream listens.

As I finish, the violet fox barks once, a sound like a glass chime shattering just right—melodiously haunting. One by one, others glance at the vibrant sight of my words suspended in space. I see uncertainty flickering across their faces. Some look away. One speaks up—agreement, hesitant but real. Then another. The chamber reshapes before my eyes, bending subtly to the truth I carried within all along.

And then I wake, still tasting the echo of starlight and courage on my tongue.
