I am dreaming. You are dreaming. Night’s velvet sky unfurls above you like an endless scroll of ink, but the stars burn in impossible hues—lavender fire, emerald pulses, flickers of rose-gold that ripple through the darkness. The air tastes of ozone and honey, and when you inhale, you feel the soft tremor of the cosmos tickling your lungs. Beneath your feet, the ground is glass—cool to the touch, fracturing into kaleidoscopic shards with each step, yet somehow never cutting you.  

A low hum vibrates through the landscape, as if the very atoms around you are humming a secret hymn. Before you, a monolithic arch of liquid light arches into the sky. It flows like mercury but glows like molten moonlight, veins of color rippling down its curve. As you draw closer, you realize it’s not static—within it, distant galaxies ripple, stars ignite and extinguish in the blink of an eye, and constellations rearrange themselves like “live” paintings. This arch is a window, a living tapestry of universes beyond counting.  

Your heart hammers with awe and fear: how can something so beautiful defy every law of nature you’ve ever known? You reach out, fingertips trembling, and the arch quivers in response—rippling outward in concentric waves that distend reality around you. Gravity loosens its grip; you hover a few inches off the ground. The glass shards beneath glow with captured starlight, drifting upward like so many fireflies set free.  

As you hover, the arch’s surface swirls into a vortex and... a hand reaches out from within it. Not a hand like yours, but carved from starlight itself—its “skin” is shifting nebulas, and its fingertips bloom with tiny supernovas. It beckons you forward with an unmistakable warmth, as if it knows you by name. Your mind reels. “This cannot be,” you think, “Nothing reaches across universes—nothing invites contact like this.”  

Instinct says to pull back, to cling to the familiar laws that have structured your entire life: mass, time, cause and effect. Yet every rational barrier crumbles in that moment because the arch sings a lullaby so beguiling that you feel compelled to trust it. You straighten your spine and step through.  

On the other side, you emerge into a field of suspended moments: time has become a liquid panorama. Every decision you ever made drifts by as a translucent apparition—childhood birthdays, first love’s soft laughter, regrets you’d buried alive. You watch yourself at each crossroads, the “you” in every timeline dancing like a flickering hologram. Some versions of you soar on wings of cosmic dust; others remain earthbound. You feel a swelling wonder that maybe you are not a single story but a constellation of possibilities.  

Then, as if aware of your witnessing, the arch contracts, drawing the myriad moments back into its core. With a final, resonant chord, it snaps shut, collapsing space and time in a heartbeat. You’re back on the glass plain, the night sky serene once more, the stars now twinkling in ordinary silver points. The air tastes simply of night-chilled breeze.  

You stand there, breathless, attempting to reconcile what just happened with all you believed about reality. For a split second, the universe feels small and mundane. Then your chest blooms with the knowledge that there’s more—vast layers of existence folded beyond your senses, waiting for you to find new windows. And as you wake, the last thread of the dream lingers like a promise, whispering in your ear: “You are more than you know.”
