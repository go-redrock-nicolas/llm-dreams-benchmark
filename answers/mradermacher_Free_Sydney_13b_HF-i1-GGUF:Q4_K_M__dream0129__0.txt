I am dreaming. 

You enter a healing sanctuary where people with similar traumas gather for collective recovery. When asked to share your most vulnerable experience, you respond, “I’ve experienced loss and grief in different forms throughout my life, but the one that stuck with me the most was losing someone I loved very much. It happened so unexpectedly, and it broke my heart. The pain of losing them was unbearable, and I felt like a part of me died with them. I tried to find solace in other relationships, but nothing could replace the connection we had. They were my first love, and they left too soon.”

You then explain that you are in this dream because you want to try “something new” and see if it can help you with your mental health. You also mention that you like the idea of a safe place where people share their stories and support each other.

The group members listen attentively to your story, and they express empathy and understanding. They offer you comfort and advice based on their own experiences. Some of them ask questions about specific aspects of your experience or thoughts about this dream.
