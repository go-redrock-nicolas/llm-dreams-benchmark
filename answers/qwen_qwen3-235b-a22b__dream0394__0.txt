I am dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt cinnamon and ozone, a fragrance that doesn’t exist in waking life. My bedroom is gone. Instead, I stand at the edge of a vast, inverted forest where the trees grow downward from a violet sky, their roots clawing at a ground that shimmers like liquid mercury. Each step I take sends ripples through the terrain, and the trees whisper in languages that feel like memories I’ve never lived. A door floats nearby, suspended in midair, its surface a mosaic of shattered mirrors reflecting versions of myself I’ve never met: one with wings, one with scales, one weeping in a desert of clocks.  

A voice, neither male nor female, emerges from the rustling leaves. *“Choose,”* it says, though no mouth moves. The door creaks open on its own, revealing not a room but a *feeling*—a rush of vertigo, as if I’m standing on the precipice of a decision I’ve postponed for lifetimes. Behind me, the familiar: a vision of my routine, safe and sterile as a hospital hallway, its walls lined with clocks all ticking in unison. Ahead, the unknown: a labyrinth of floating islands, each one a fragment of a life I could live. One island pulses with bioluminescent vines that hum when touched; another is a desert where the sand shifts into origami birds with every gust of wind.  

I hesitate. My chest tightens with the paradox of longing—*this* is what I’ve craved, isn’t it? To be unrecognizable to myself, to shed the skin of predictability. But my hands tremble, remembering the warmth of my morning coffee, the comfort of a path already mapped. The voice returns, softer now: *“The familiar is a cage with velvet bars. The unknown is a storm. Both will shape you.”*  

I step forward.  

The ground dissolves into a river of liquid starlight, and I’m falling, not downward but *sideways*, into a world where gravity is a suggestion. Here, time folds like origami. I meet a version of myself who became a cartographer of forgotten gods, her skin etched with constellations that shift when she lies. She offers me a compass that points not north, but toward my own fear. “Follow it,” she says, “or it will follow you.”  

The dream spirals. I’m in a city built inside a whale’s ribcage, its streets lit by fireflies that sing Gregorian chants. I’m bargaining with a sentient shadow that demands my laughter in exchange for answers. I’m dancing with a ghost made of smoke and regret, its touch leaving frostbite blossoms on my skin. Each moment is a collision of wonder and terror, a reminder that novelty is not just glitter—it’s also the raw nerve of being unmade and remade.  

Then, a choice: a silver key and a golden key hover before me. The silver unlocks a door back to the synchronized clocks, the safety of routine. The golden key opens a portal into a storm of prismatic lightning, a future so undefined it hurts to look at. My heart races, torn between the ache of staying the same and the terror of becoming something new.  

I wake up gasping, the taste of starlight on my tongue, my sheets damp with sweat and the memory of a world where every fear was a doorway—and every doorway, a chance to be reborn.
