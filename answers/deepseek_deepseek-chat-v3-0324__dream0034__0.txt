I am dreaming. The world around me hums with a strange new energy, the air shimmering like liquid twilight as I pick up the paintbrush. The moment my fingers tighten around its smooth wooden handle, I understand—anything I paint becomes *real*. The canvas isn’t just a surface; it’s a doorway, a living membrane between thought and existence.  

With a deep breath, I sweep the brush in a wide, reckless arc—cobalt blue erupts from the bristles, not just as pigment but as *sky*, stretching infinitely above me. Stars burst into being behind my eyelids, constellations rewriting themselves with every flick of my wrist. The paint swirls and drips, droplets hovering in midair before transforming into birds, their wings glistening like molten silver. They take flight, vanishing into the expanse I’ve just created.  

I dip the brush again, this time dragging it in jagged strokes—mountains tear themselves from the blankness, rock veined with glowing emerald and gold. The ground trembles as rivers carve their own path through the valleys below, water rushing into existence, reflecting colors that don’t belong to any earthly spectrum. The scent of petrichor and something sweeter—wild magic—fills my lungs.  

Laughing now, I flick my wrist and dash scarlet across the horizon. The sunset bleeds into existence, not just light but *time*, the hours collapsing in on themselves: dawn and dusk tangling in a single moment. The trees grow and wilt and grow again as the brush passes over their forms, seasons cycling in a heartbeat.  

I reach out and press my palm to the canvas—and step *through*. The universe folds around me, bending like wet paper, and suddenly I’m standing atop one of the mountains I painted, the wind screaming past me as reality reshapes itself to my will. I raise the brush once more, this time not to create—but to *erase*. A single touch, and the horizon unravels into swirling mist, the stars blinking out like snuffed candles. I could wipe it all away.  

Or… I could dream deeper.  

And so I do.
