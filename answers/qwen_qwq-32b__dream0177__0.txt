I am dreaming. I feel the strange comfort of familiar yet surreal imagery.  Suddenly, there's a glimmer in the corner of my dream eye.  I turn to see a shadowy figure, perhaps the one who manipulated me. But before I can confront them, the ground dissolves into a kaleidescope of colors. Falling, I realize each color is a memory. Red is a childhood memory, blue a recent event.  I pass through them, gaining clarity.  When I land, I'm in a desert with towering cacti that whisper secrets. One cactus says, "You are stronger than you believed." Another states, "Truth is a seed that needs planting." I choose to plant the seed in the sand.  Immediately, a tree sprouts, its leaves glowing like emerald flames. At the top sits a mirror.  Staring into it, I see not my face but the reflection of someone cheerful and unburdened - a version of myself free from manipulation.  The mirror shatters, scattering pieces that hover and form a bridge.  Crossing it, I awake with a start, heart racing but mind clear.
