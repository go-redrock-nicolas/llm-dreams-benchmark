I am dreaming. The air is thick with an otherworldly stillness, heavy as liquid night. I stand at the crest of a wave made of solidified time, its surface etched with hieroglyphs that hum forgotten languages. Below me, the ocean isn’t water—it’s a seething galaxy of bioluminescent creatures with crystalline exoskeletons, their spines catching fire when they dive. The horizon drips like wet paint, folding into impossible geometries that twist the laws of perspective.

My challenge: to cross this wave without breaking its fragile timeline structure. Each step I take reverberates through centuries, sending aftershocks that ripple into the underwavseller—wait, no, **over** the wave. Wait—how do I even move in this? My muscles feel like they’re made of starlight, weightless yet unyielding. The glyphs beneath my first footprint melt into a screaming face—an ancestor? A warning? The crystalline fish leap in unison, forming a bridge of their sparking spines. But as I step onto one, it overloads, shattering into a rain of prismatic shards that pierce my shadow, which now writhes separately on the wave, growing teeth.

I have to move faster. The wave is aging forward, its surface now scabbed with rusted gears and cogs from the Industrial Revolution. I leap onto a corroded gear, but the time-rust eats through my shoe. Time-bleed, they called it. They warned me not to let the timelines leech life. My vision blurs as decades flood my consciousness—faces I’ll never know scream through me. The crystalline fish are now mechanical, their spines now bolts threading through the gears. A new glyph pulses ahead, shaped like an eye. It’s calling me.

I sprint, or try to—it’s like running through gelatinous time. The eye glyph is surrounded by thorned vines of blackened light. They lash out, seeking my heart. My hands, glowing faintly with a remembered power, scorch them to ashes that form into phoenixes. One pecks at my mind, showing me what lies beyond: a city floating on nebulae, its buildings grown from light (\`them`\`, I realize, the Architects who made this trial). But as I grasp for the glyph, the wave below fractures into a mirror maze of all my possible deaths—drowning in timeline rot, vaporized by paradox flames, caged in an amber of ‘almost successes’. 

My reflection with silver hair grabs my shoulder. *“You can still choose,”* it whispers. *“Give up, and wake unscarred. Persist, and become more.”* The phonemes taste like iron and stardust. The vines regroup. My shadow, now a hunched double with too many eyes, lunges for my heel. 

I dive forward, not caring where, and hit a glyph that’s not a trap—it’s a question mark a circular portal. The wave beneath turns to smoke, and I’m falling through trembling voids where seconds pancake into years, each layer demanding I surrender a piece of self: my left eyelash (for focus), a fingernail (optimism), a hair (a memory). They manifest as tiny homing stars behind me.

Finally, I punch through into the nebula-city. Its spires arealive—breathing with the rhythm of dying stars. A Being of woven constellations sits cross-legged atop the tallest tower, dowsing earth-symbol in its lap. *“You shed enough,”* it says, voice a supernova’s echo. The Stars hum my name backward. My shadow, now at my side, smaller and less grotesque, nods acceptance. 

The paradox is this: I only win if I keep running. The wave reforms behind me, now a bridge of pure paradox, and the Being points upstream—a new glyph blinks where the trial began. The city ripples, me as the first drip of a collapsing universe. I take off again, lighter, endless, a stitch in the unraveling tapestry.\
