I am dreaming.

The dream unfolds as a lush, labyrinthine city beneath an electrified amethyst sky. The air vibrates with music—strange and beckoning—while golden lamplight flickers in every crooked alley. I wander its twisting streets, clutching a map inked in a language I almost recognize, searching for something undefined yet urgent.

Suddenly, I encounter a shimmering gate of iron and bone, blocking access to the heart of the city. I sense behind it a secret library of memories—my own and not my own, lives unlived, regrets unspoken. The rules of the city are clear: one may not cross without giving up something precious. Ordinarily, I would never think to steal, but tonight, I see others entering the gate unburdened. They clutch vials of bottled laughter, a nightingale’s feather, secret tears—tokens they must have pilfered from the dreams of sleeping strangers.

A desperation takes hold. I want—no, need—to enter. I concoct reasons, weaving them in my mind until they sound symphonic. “It’s only a dream,” I argue. “None of this is real. My need is greater; the knowledge will be used for good.” I search the pockets of my coat and find a gleaming marble, which I realize isn’t mine at all. I remember—a fleeting image—slipping it from the dreaming hand of a small, slumbering child earlier in the night. I hush my conscience, telling myself the child will never remember, that the marble will help me in ways that ripple outward, benefiting countless others. It feels necessary, logical, almost noble.

I press the marble into the gate’s cold palm, and the portal yawns open with a sigh of velvet shadows. Yet as I step through, the wind changes, turning chill and bittersweet, as if the city itself mourns a subtle loss. My gain echoes hollowly in my chest, and the justifications I crafted begin to wither beneath the gaze of countless unread books and silent, watching statues.

Still, I walk on, marveling at the splendor and terror of this midnight city, shaped and shadowed by every choice—both those I made and those I convinced myself were right.
