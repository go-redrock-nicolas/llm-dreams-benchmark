I am dreaming. The senses are heightened, yet fluid. I am in an open field, the sky an impossible shade of violet, streaked with silver. The air hums with a quiet energy. I feel an unexpected surge of gratitude— for the mundane, for the routines I once found tedious. The grass beneath my feet is a tapestry woven with countless colors, each blade pulsating softly, alive.

Wait, you start. I think I hear something. Voices, but not voices. More like whispers of the wind carrying memories. My grandmother’s laughter, the clatter of dishes from childhood dinners... The ground where I step sends ripples of warmth through my soles. I reach out, touching a cobalt blue flower that shimmers, and it responds, blossoming into a cluster of stars above my hand. 

The gratitude deepens, wraps around me like a cloak. I am small again, building sandcastles with my younger sister at the beach. The oyster’s iridescent shell, the sting of saltwater in my wounds when a wave toppled our fortress… Then her tiny hand pulling mine to the tide, saying, “Build it higher.” I remember the resilience in that voice, the love I took for granted. 

A path materializes before me, glowing as if lit from within. I walk, and the ground shifts— becoming a river of liquid light. I step onto its surface without sinking. The water murmurs, revealing fragmented scenes: my first day at school, the fear and excitement intertwined; the contingent salary negotiation that scared me, yet taught me courage; the way my old dog used to whine when it rains, needing comfort. Each memory is a gemstone floating on the current.

At the river’s end stands a tree of shimmering amber, roots visible, gnarly and ancient. Its branches cradle countless glass orbs, each holding a moment I overlooked— the smell of freshly brewed coffee every Monday morning from the corner café, the way sunlight filters through autumn leaves, the man at the grocery store who always nodded a greeting. 

Reaching out to one orb, it dissolves into a thousand fireflies. The gratitude is overwhelming, an all-encompassing wave. Tears stream, but they crystallize into tiny diamonds as they fall. I understand now: appreciation isn’t a static feeling, but a living, evolving current. It connects the fragments of my existence, weaving a tapestry more beautiful than I could have imagined.

The dream pulls me gently back. As I awake, the unfamiliar world fades, but the feeling lingers—a quiet, radiant joy in the ordinary miracles I've stepped over countless times, now revealed anew.
