I am dreaming. You’re standing on a stage suspended between two colossal, rotating gears that churn the sky into a bruised twilight. The audience below isn’t human—they’re faceless silhouettes with eyes like flickering candle flames, their whispers a hive-mind hum that vibrates in your molars. Your presentation slides are projected onto the clouds, but the words bleed like ink in rain, morphing into hieroglyphs you can’t decipher. Your palms sweat rivulets of liquid starlight, pooling at your feet and warping the floorboards into a spongy, bioluminescent moss that pulses with your heartbeat.  

The clock above isn’t a clock at all—it’s a hollowed-out sun, its gears grinding like a dying engine, each tick a thunderclap that cracks your ribs from the inside. You try to speak, but your tongue is a live wire, sparking syllables that combust into crows mid-air. They peck at the screen, tearing holes in the presentation until all that’s left is a slideshow of your childhood failures: the recital where you forgot the dance steps, the science fair project that flopped, your father’s furrowed brow.  

The audience begins to melt, their candle-eyes floating upward like will-o’-the-wisps as their forms dissolve into a thick, iridescent fog that seeps into your ears, whispering statistics about failure rates and the exact number of seconds left before the sun-clock implodes. You clutch your notes, but the paper transforms into a swarm of moths, their wings fluttering the same indecipherable glyphs from the slides. Your throat tightens, a noose of static, and you realize you’ve been rehearsing this moment in your head for years—every stumble, every panic attack, every sleepless night—a loop of dread now playing on a screen behind you, projected for all to see.  

Then, the gears snap. The stage collapses into a spiral of staircases that lead nowhere, each step a memory, a fear, a “what if.” You fall upward, plummeting into a void where time pools like blackwater, and there, in the abyss, you see the presentation room: your colleagues, the polished table, the expectant silence. But you’re still here, trapped in the dream’s funhouse mirror, screaming into the vacuum as the candle-eyes watch, waiting.  

You wake just as the sun-clock swallows itself. Your sheets are soaked in phantom starlight. The presentation is hours away, but your heart races like you’ve already failed.
