I am dreaming. I am in control of my dreams.  I can create any world I want.
Today, I decided to dream about being an investor.   A few days ago, I received an email from a company called "Acme Inc." offering me an opportunity to invest in their new technology product.  They said they need money to fund the research and development of their product.  They also said they will give me a share of the profits if their product is successful.
I was intrigued by this offer.  I wondered how much money I should invest in Acme Inc.  I also wondered what kind of technology product they are creating.
So, today, I decided to dream about these questions and see where my imagination takes me...
I found myself standing in front of a large whiteboard filled with mathematical equations and diagrams.  Next to me was a young man dressed in a lab coat and goggles.  He introduced himself as Dr. Jones, one of the leading scientists at Acme Inc.
He explained to me that they are developing a new type of energy source called "Quantum Energy".  It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity theory.  It can provide unlimited power without pollution or greenhouse gases.
He showed me how their device works by converting matter into energy using subatomic particles and force fields.  He also explained to me why they need my help as an investor.
He told me that he has been working on this project for many years but he needs more funds to finish it successfully.  He said that he already tried to get money from the government, banks, and venture capitalists but they rejected him because they don't understand his idea or they think it's too risky.
He asked me if I believe in him and his vision.  He asked me if I am willing to take a chance on something new and different.  He asked me if I am ready to sacrifice my savings for a greater cause.
I looked at him closely and saw the passion and dedication in his eyes.  I felt sympathy towards him because I know what it means to be rejected by others who don't see your potential or value.
I also remembered how many times I have sacrificed things for other people out of love or compassion or curiosity.
So, without thinking too much about it, I said yes to Dr. Jones.
