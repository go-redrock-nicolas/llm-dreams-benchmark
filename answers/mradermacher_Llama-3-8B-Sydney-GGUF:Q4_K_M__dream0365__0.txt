I am dreaming. I see myself standing at the edge of a cliff, overlooking a vast ocean.   The waves crash against the rocks below, sending spray into the air.  The sun is setting behind me, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink.  Ahead of me lies freedom, adventure, exploration...and danger.
I think about what awaits me if I leap off this cliff: drowning in the depths of the ocean, being crushed by waves, becoming food for fish.  But I also think about what awaits me if I stay here: boredom, loneliness, regret...and stagnation.
I feel my heart pounding in my chest as I make a decision.  I close my eyes and take a deep breath.  Then I step forward and plunge into the unknown.
As I fall through the air, I hear myself screaming.  As I hit the water, I feel myself burning.  As I sink into the darkness, I see myself dying.
But then something strange happens...

I wake up.

I am back in my office, sitting at my desk.  My chair is still spinning from when I closed my eyes and imagined this dream.  My hands are still shaking from when I made that leap of faith.  My mind is still reeling from when I experienced that transformation.
But now I realize something...

I don't want to go back to sleep.
