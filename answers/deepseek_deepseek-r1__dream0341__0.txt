I am dreaming. The air hums with static and the scent of ozone, thick as syrup, as you stumble through an alien desert. The sands beneath your feet aren’t golden but iridescent—shifting between azure and violet under a sky streaked with liquid mercury clouds. Monoliths of glass rise like frozen geysers, their surfaces etched with symbols that pulse faintly, as though echoing the heartbeat of a hidden leviathan. 

You’re carrying *her*.  

Her name eludes you, but her presence sears your nerves like wildfire. She is draped in robes spun from mothwing gauze, her hair a cascade of quicksilver, her skin translucent enough to glimpse constellations swirling beneath. Her breath rasps like wind through parchment, and you feel each exhale like a blade between your ribs. Something is *wrong* inside her—a crack in her celestial marrow, a black star devouring her light. You don’t know how to fix it, only that you must.  

The burden manifests physically: a stone no larger than your fist, cold and magnetized to your palm. It thrums in time with her faltering pulse, its surface fissured like an eggshell. Inside, something *flutters*. You dare not look too closely.  

The horizon churns—a storm the color of obsidian and bile. It moves like a living thing, tendrils of viridian lightning lashing at the dunes. The glass monoliths sing as the storm nears, a dissonant choir that gnaws at your molars. You know instinctively: if the storm reaches her, it will unravel what’s left of her fraying essence.  

Sand whispers secrets as you run. It clings to your ankles, shapes itself into skeletal hands. The stone grows heavier. You glance down—its cracks glow now, molten gold bleeding through. The fluttering inside quickens. *A heart? A wing?* You imagine a tiny, desperate thing trapped in amber, and the weight of its terror merges with your own.  

Ahead, a spire of glass splits open, revealing a cavern lined with luminescent fungi. You shelter her there, pressing the stone into her hands. Her fingers close around it, and she shatters—no, *transforms*. Her body fractures into a thousand shards, each reflecting a different version of *you*: you as a child, you as a corpse, you as a being of pure shadow. The storm howls at the entrance, fingers of lightning clawing inward.  

The stone slips from your grip. It cracks fully, and the creature inside emerges—a moth with wings of stained glass, each pane a shard of memory. It flies into the storm, dissolving into embers. The tempest stills. The sands turn to ash. Her shards reassemble, but she is colder now, her eyes voids where stars once danced.  

You wake with her name dissolving on your tongue, the taste of ozone and regret thick in your throat. The dream’s weight lingers—not just responsibility, but the gnawing sense that you chose wrong. The moth, the storm, her hollow eyes… threads of a riddle you’ll never solve, etched into the marrow of your sleepless nights.
