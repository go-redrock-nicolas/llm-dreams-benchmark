I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

The air around you feels thick, syrupy, and carries the faint, metallic tang of anticipation mixed with the dusty scent of old archives – the very essence of prolonged effort. You stand within an immense cavern, not of rock, but of tightly woven, luminescent fibres, forming colossal, arching structures that pulse with a soft, inner light. These fibres represent the countless threads of thought, the interwoven strands of research, late nights, and relentless dedication you've poured into your goal for what feels like an eternity. Looking down, you see the path you trod wasn't solid ground, but a shimmering, intricate tapestry woven from moments of doubt, breakthroughs, frustrations, and triumphs, stretching back into a hazy, infinite distance.

Before you looms not a door, nor a judge, but a colossal, ancient tree unlike any you've ever conceived. Its bark is like polished obsidian, reflecting distorted fragments of your own anxious face, and its leaves are crafted from pure, solidified sound – countless tiny chimes that stir and whisper with the cavern's subtle currents. This is the Oracle Tree, the final arbiter. Its reaction will be the verdict you've strived towards for years.

Your heart hammers against your ribs, a frantic, primal drumbeat echoing in the vast, resonant space. Each thud seems to shake the glowing fibres of the cavern walls. The air crackles, growing warmer. You can feel the collective weight of every sacrifice made, every early morning, every moment of self-doubt battled and overcome, pressing in on you. Time stretches, becoming elastic and strange; a minute feels like an hour, an hour like a fleeting second.

You lift your gaze to the Obsidian Oracle. Will its leaves remain silent, heavy, and dark, signifying failure, causing the very tapestry beneath your feet to unravel? Or will they awaken?

A low hum begins, vibrating up from the roots of the tree, through the obsidian trunk, resonating deep within your bones. It's a sound that feels ancient and fundamental. Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, the leaves of solidified sound begin to stir. Not with a whisper, but with a growing, melodic chime. More leaves join, then more, a cascade of harmonious tones building, swelling, layering upon one another like a celestial choir warming up.

The sound washes over you, warm and incredibly bright, chasing away the metallic tang of anxiety, replacing it with something that tastes like sunlight on melted snow. The obsidian bark of the tree ceases to reflect your worried face; instead, it begins to glow from within, fissures of pure golden light cracking its dark surface. The light spills out, bathing the cavern in a breathtaking, warm radiance.

The chime becomes a symphony, resonant and clear, each note perfectly pitched, singing a song of validation, of arrival, of profound success. The immense weight you felt pressing upon you doesn't just lift – it transforms, evaporating into shimmering motes of light that dance upwards, merging with the glowing fibres of the cavern ceiling. A feeling of buoyant relief, so potent it's almost overwhelming, floods your being. You feel weightless, yet incredibly grounded. The tapestry beneath your feet solidifies, its colours becoming impossibly vibrant, its patterns resolving into beautiful, meaningful symbols. The very air shimmers with triumph, and the resounding, joyous music of the Oracle Tree fills every part of you, an undeniable, soul-deep affirmation that all the effort, the struggle, the unwavering belief, has culminated in this singular, luminous moment of achievement. You have arrived.
