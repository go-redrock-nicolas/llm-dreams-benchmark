I am dreaming. As you hurtle down the steep, winding road, heart hammering against your ribs, a surreal landscape unfurls before your eyes like a carnival funhouse reflected in a broken mirror. The cars ahead of you begin to shimmer and distort, morphing into fantastical creatures that prance and pirouette across the asphalt. A menagerie of impossible beasts cavorts in your wake - knowing smiles and flashy clothes flying at the edge of your vision.

Glass bubbles the size of  drift down from the sky, momentarily blocking your view. When they burst against your windshield, wind chimes materialize, tinkling madly and trailing inklings of forgotten melodies.

Your car begins to levitate slightly, as if the road itself has developed a gentle cushion. The strain on the brakes lessens, allowing you to Breath easy and focus on the impossible scene before you. You cruise past a floating band performing jazz, their instruments caned in gold and puffing with smoke. A flock of clockwork birds circle overhead, their gears and springs clinking together softly.

The traffic ahead parts for you like the Red Sea, and an empty lane opens up - an invitation to a space where the rules of the physical world have been craedefy reinvented. As you cross the invisible threshold, the brake lines suddenly sing with life once more, and you glide to a stop at the edge of a pulsating light.

Emerging from the passenger side is your guide - a luminous woman adorned in filmy scarves and eyes that shimmer like the night sky. She beckons you to follow her down the glowing light, past towering mushrooms that whisper secrets, and into the dancing halls of the dream realm, where wonders await beyond your wildest imagination.
