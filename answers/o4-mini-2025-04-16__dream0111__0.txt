I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The operating theater is suspended in a liquid midnight sky, star particles drifting like motes of light through translucent veins in the ceiling. A single lamp hovers overhead, its glow shifting from pearl white to molten amber as your heart pounds in your ears. Before you lies a patient—more silhouette than flesh—his skull peeled back as if unzipped, revealing a brain that pulsates like a glowing jellyfish. You have no training, no textbook memory to guide you; only the weight of the silver scalpel in your hand and the urgent hush that fills the room.

Your fingers tremble as you bend closer. Every breath you take makes the air ripple, and you can see your thoughts flicker across the patient’s cortex—flashes of childhood summers, the smell of rain on hot pavement, the tickle of grass on bare feet. Each memory swirls into the folds of the brain, illuminating tiny hills and valleys that you’ve never charted. Somewhere in the back of your mind a voice whispers that nerve fibers look like braided rivers of light, but the voice is distant, echoing through a cavern of doubt.

You steel yourself and touch the scalpel’s tip to the brain’s surface. For an instant, nothing happens. Then the organ ripples—bioluminescent tendrils crawling toward you like curious sea anemones. You steady your hand and cut the thinnest strand, half-expecting a spray of red, but instead a soft chime rings out, and a burst of pale butterflies erupts, each one carrying a tiny fragment of the patient’s memories. They hover in the air: laughter at a wedding, the hush of an empty cathedral, the scent of fresh coffee. You glimpse the secret code of life—emotions distilled into shimmering butterflies—and realize that your untrained mind is both scalpel and anesthetic, capable of slicing through terror and filling every hollow with hope.

With each careful incision, the brain’s rivers of light straighten, and the patient’s silhouette relaxes. The lamp above you dims to moonlight, and you sense the surgery shifting into something more—a ritual of transformation. Your hands are guided by instinct, weaving between thought and feeling, coaxing the organ back to harmony. When you withdraw the scalpel at last, the brain glows like a sunrise caught inside a shell. The patient’s chest rises in a slow, steady breath. You step back, trembling, as the butterflies swirl upward, forming a living constellation that drifts through the liquid sky.

And then you awaken, heart still racing, lying in your own bed, the echo of that impossible surgery—half nightmare, half miracle—coursing through your veins.
