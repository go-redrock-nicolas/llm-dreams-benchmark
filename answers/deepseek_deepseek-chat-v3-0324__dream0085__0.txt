I am dreaming. The air hums with the scent of burning lavender and iron, thick and metallic, as I step onto the cobbled streets of a city that breathes. The buildings are alive—walls pulsing with veins of bioluminescent vines, windows blinking like watching eyes. The ground beneath me shifts subtly, not in threat, but in greeting, as if the earth itself recognizes a newcomer.  

The people here move with quiet purpose, their bodies adorned not with clothing, but with living tattoos—shifting ink that tells stories of past lives, futures yet unlived. They speak without words, their emotions rippling through the air in waves of color, a language of synesthetic emotion.  

To them, solitude is strange. They exist in shared energy, thoughts brushing against each other like passing breezes. But I—I cherish silence, my thoughts my own. They sense my hesitation, and their curiosity is a cool blue haze tinged with gold.  

I do not try to mimic them. Instead, when one reaches out, their fingers trailing sparks, I offer a memory—not in colors or shifting ink, but in the old way: words. I tell them of mornings where mist clung to fields, of the precious weight of a secret held close to the heart.  

The air shudders as they absorb this foreign sensation, this *privacy*, this alchemy of words. Some pull back, intrigued but uncertain. Others lean closer, their own luminous markings shifting to form shapes—letters, clumsy but earnest, to mirror my own way.  

I have not become them. They have not become me. But the city sighs in approval as something new blooms between us—a bridge woven of mist and fire, of whispered stories and vivid silence.  

And in the way of dreams, I understand: sometimes the deepest integration is not in changing oneself, but in letting the unseen parts of you be witnessed.  

Then—softly—the vision dissolves, and I stir awake, the scent of lavender still lingering on my skin.
