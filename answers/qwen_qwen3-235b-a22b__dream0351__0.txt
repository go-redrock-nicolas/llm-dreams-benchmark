I am dreaming. It feels more like a memory—intimate and strangely familiar, as if I’ve lived it before in the secret corners of my mind. I stand at the ocean’s edge, bare feet buried in cool silver sand that glints faintly under a low, smoldering sky. Above me, a canvas of swirling gray clouds slips and churns like liquid smoke, painted faintly at the edges with ribbons of violet and crimson light. The horizon has vanished, devoured by a sea restless with waves that rise like fists, as though the ocean itself is fighting for breath or breaking apart beneath its own heaving chest.  

There is no sun, only a distant glow pulsed through the clouds—as if something ancient and powerful is trying to rise, but can’t. Not yet.

The salt in the air burns my throat faintly, and I can hear the waves combing the shore with a kind of mournful rhythm, the sound breaking in slow, aching strokes, like the heartbeat of something tired and aching to collapse. And as I step farther into the surf, the water is on fire—not with heat, but with cold. I crawl inside the chill and don’t flinch; I wade farther and farther into the depth, endless as time.

Each step drags me deeper into this vast, liquid unknown. The sand beneath my feet dissolves into something smoother, firmer, and then I notice the water has stopped rising. I’m moving, gliding—inexplicably dry despite the roiling sea surrounding me. My skin feels dulled, like it’s been painted over with a sheen of silken nothingness, like I’ve become a ghost of myself.

And then comes the cracking.  

They call it breaking, but in this dream, it happens like this: the emotion that I have clutched to me, buried so far beneath my breath that I almost forgot it was there—it pulses. Then ripples outward, like a crack forms in me down to my core. My ribs split, a sharp, shuddering crack that I hear echo in every part of me. And all at once, a storm erupts.  

The sky splits open above me with electric screams of silver lightning, and brilliant forks of fire smash into the sea. Poor artifices, really—lightning too ordinary for this abyss of a dream. For beneath the waves and chaos, the stars rise. Not real stars, not from any world I’ve ever known: luminous, brilliant shapes float slowly upward from the endless depths below me—shapes impossible to define, like symbols carved from light, aching with a sense of meaning I cannot grasp. They shine with a force that feels like truth but burns like pain.

And in their glow, I see my emotions given form: shards of glass spiraling outward around me, spinning so fast they blur into something silken, fluid, and terrible. My grief rends the surface of the waves and becomes ribbons of black smoke. My fear takes wings and sweeps through the air, coiling like serpents. My anguish is a storm, jagged lines tearing across the edges of the dream like tears in reality itself.

Only now I understand: I am not breaking. I am forming.  

I am assembling—fractured edges knitting back together in a strange, deliberate tapestry of every feeling I’d buried for so long. My cracks fill with those same ribbons of fire-painted lightning and the shards of glassry soften into something luminous, like spun light. I look down: my reflection swims in the sea below me, disfigured at first, struggling, but over time—changing. Becoming something more than a mirror. Becoming golden, fierce, unbound.

And suddenly I feel them—the archaic pull of water's hands grasping, guiding, carrying me somewhere I cannot yet name. I am suspended between two worlds, the one I left and the one I haven't touched yet, and for a moment the dream pivots.  

A circle of light opens beneath the waves—a door that radiates in hues no eye has seen. I descend toward it, weightless now, carried by currents that sing in ancient and unintelligible languages. Strands of starlight coil around me like bracelets, and the water turns sweet against my skin. My heart swells, defies the ache, beats steady against the madness of the dream. I give in. The hands lift me beneath the surface, the light pulls me forward, and the cracked self I shed falls away behind me, dissolving into the ocean behind.

The rest is a haze, but before I wake, I hear this:  

**Truth does not care for silence. Even oceans scream when they dare to dream.**
