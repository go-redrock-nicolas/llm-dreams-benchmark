I am dreaming.  You have no intention of waking up yet.

You decide to explore your current surroundings before taking any action or making a decision about the crisis at hand.

In your dream, you find yourself in an open field with scattered trees and bushes around. The sun is setting behind the horizon casting warm orange and yellow hues across the sky.  You feel calm and peaceful here.

You wonder if this place has any significance or connection to the crisis and responsibility you are feeling.
