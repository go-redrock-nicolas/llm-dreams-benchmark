I am dreaming. it's like falling through a vast cathedral of stars, each twinkle a heartbeat in the silence. I land softly on a plain where the sky is a swirling tapestry of violet and gold, and the air shimmers as though holding its breath. Beneath my feet, the ground is neither soil nor stone, but something alive, pulsing faintly like it remembers being a heart.

A city rises in the distance, its towers tilted as if listening for a voice only they can hear. Birds shaped like inkblots flap noiselessly through the sky. The wind carries no sound, only meanings—whispers of emotions I’ve never felt before tangled into the air like perfume.

And then, I see _the threshold._ A doorway made of strips of light stitched together by threads of shadow. On one side, the world is orderly—symmetrical trees, people in rigid robes reciting equations into the wind, the ground emblazoned with glowing glyphs of law and logic. On the other side, chaos shimmers: impossible geometry, sounds made visible, people dancing in surreal patterns like they’re painting with time.

I’ve been warned: *Follow the rules. Never cross without permission.* Law here isn’t written—it’s *felt,* embedded in the roots of the world, self-replicating like instinct.

But I see a child across the threshold. Or perhaps it's not a child, not exactly—just something fragile, trembling, holding a bleeding star in its hands. Its eyes meet mine, and I feel something pierce deeper than guilt.

It doesn’t call for help. It doesn’t have to.

Behind me stands a figure in a robe of obsidian—and on their chest is a ticking hourglass. A Watcher. They say, *Do not intervene. You know the decree. Laws must be obeyed.* And I do know. Disobedience ripples. Once broken, rules unravel into ruin. I've been taught that.

But:  
The child is fading.  
The star is dimming.  
And the air feels colder with every breath the child doesn’t take.

My brain whispers possibilities:  
*What if the laws are wrong?*  
*What if compassion is a higher order of law?*  
*What if I’m not here for obedience—but for action?*

The choice isn’t simple, not in the way decisions usually are. It's more like gravity pulling from two worlds at once, my heart torn between the promise of order and the scream of necessity.

The Watcher stirs but does not move closer. Perhaps even they're watching to see—weighing my soul in this suspended moment.

I close my eyes.  
I step through the doorway.

The moment my foot crosses the boundary of light and shadow, the world convulses. The sky folds in on itself like origami caught in a storm. The city vibrates so fast it disappears into a hum.

And I land again—back where I started, the dream resetting itself in a loop.

But now I *carry* the bleeding star.

The rules have changed.  
Because I changed them.

And the dream watches me watching it.  

Waiting to see what happens next...
