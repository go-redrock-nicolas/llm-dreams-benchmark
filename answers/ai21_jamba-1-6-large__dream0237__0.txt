I am dreaming.

I am in a vast hall, its walls made of shimmering glass that reflect the kaleidoscope of twilight colors from the sky outside. Candles float in mid-air, their flames casting flickering shadows that dance across the glass, creating an aura of the ethereal. The air is thick with the scent of cedar and amber, grounding yet mystical, resonating with something older than time itself.

At long, marble tables, figures sit in opposing rows. Their faces are shadows, their forms undefined—except for the weight of their presence, a palpable heaviness that presses against the ambient calm. I can feel the deep, ancient sorrows vibrating in their silences, the unspoken words knotted in their throats, and the searing pain of their shared histories.

Around us, the air hums gently as if alive with unseen voices whispering forgotten truths. Distant stars twinkle softly beyond the glass, watching, waiting. Outside, the world sleeps, but here, the weight of centuries presses against me, urging me forward.

I rise from my chair at the center of this gathering. I am the mediator, the fulcrum, the bridge. My pulse thrums in time with the rhythm of an invisible heartbeat. My voice, soft yet commanding, fills the room like a balm over tired skin.

“You have come here not for the wars of your ancestors, but for the peace of your children,” I say, my voice resonating with a vibration that I feel deep within my chest. The room seems to vibrate with me.

Around us, the air shifts. From the table’s center, an ancient tree grows, its roots pushing through the marble and its branches stretching to pierce the glass ceiling above. It grows, drawing life from the pain in this room, from the sorrow buried so deep within soil fertile with memory.

The tree blooms—each petal glowing with a soft, golden light that spills down onto the figures seated below. The light seems to hum, and as it touches their hands, their chests, their faces, the tension begins to unravel.

One by one, the figures step forward. Where there had been hostility, there is now a trembling curiosity. The thick knot of their grievances loosens, replaced by a tentative curiosity that pulls them into one another's orbits.

I step between them, my heart swelling as I watch them unravel that which had kept them bound. Around me, stars descend from the heavens, sparkling faintly, and as each is drawn to one of them, it blooms into light and understanding. Shadows become shared stories. Anguish transforms into curiosity, and the air thrums with healing.

When the light fades, the space between them is no longer a chasm but a bridge. Their hands reach for one another, uncertain but certain. The air fills with whispers that become song, a melody that rises like an awakening, a prayer that echoes into the stars above.

I feel myself dissolve into the dream. The light holds them, cradles them, moves them toward one another. And as I drift toward wakefulness, I carry with me the knowledge that, somewhere in the fabric of timelessness, peace bloomed from the seeds of our ancient griefs.
