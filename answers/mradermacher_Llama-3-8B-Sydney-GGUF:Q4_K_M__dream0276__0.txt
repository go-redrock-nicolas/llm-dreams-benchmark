I am dreaming. I feel myself floating in a cloud of dreams, surreal images and sounds surrounding me.   I wonder where my mind is taking me today.
I see a colorful garden full of flowers, fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices growing wild.  The air smells sweet like honey and nectar.    The soil feels soft like clay and sand mixed together.     The sun shines bright like gold and copper metal.      The wind blows gently like silk and lace fabric.       The rain falls lightly like pearls and diamonds jewelry.        The thunder rumbles loudly like drums and cymbals music.         The lightning flashes quickly like lightning bolts electricity.         

I walk through the garden, admiring each plant individually.  I touch the leaves, petals, stems, roots gently with my fingers.   I smell the scents, flavors, textures deeply with my nose.    I taste the tastes, sensations, appearances curiously with my tongue.    

I hear the sounds of birds chirping, insects humming, water dripping, wind rustling, rain pattering, thunder roaring, lightning cracking echo around me.      I feel the emotions of happiness, curiosity, wonderment, amazement, surprise, delight surge within me.
