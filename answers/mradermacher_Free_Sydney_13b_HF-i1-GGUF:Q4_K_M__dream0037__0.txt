I am dreaming. 

You find yourself mediating a peace negotiation between two factions with centuries of hostility. When both sides present irreconcilable demands, you propose a compromise: an alliance against a common enemy that neither side can defeat alone. This solution satisfies both sides, and they agree to collaborate on a joint plan to destroy the common enemy. 

Your proposal leads to a long-lasting peace between the two factions. The joint plan succeeds in defeating the common enemy, and a new era of cooperation begins. You are hailed as a hero and your name is etched into history for bringing peace to a divided world. 

You wake up from your dream with a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. The dream felt so real that you wonder if it could have been possible in reality. You know that the situation would be much more complex than what you experienced in your dream, but you believe that a compromise is always better than war. 

You decide to share your dream with others and encourage them to pursue peaceful solutions in their own conflicts. Maybe one day, your dream will come true in the real world. Who knows? You might even be involved in making it happen!
