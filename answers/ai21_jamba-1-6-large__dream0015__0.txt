I am dreaming. I find myself in a post-apocalyptic world, where the landscape is a desolate wasteland, devoid of the usual splendor of nature and the laughter of children. Instead, abandoned cars and rusted machinery sit like tombstones, lifeless relics of a past we once called normal. The air is thick with the scent of ash and metal, mingling with the faint but ever-present odor of death. The sun hangs heavy and red in the polluted sky, casting a crimson glow over the ruins of what was once a grand city. I can almost hear the faint echoes of its former inhabitants, whispers of a life long forgotten. 

As I walk through the crumbling remains, the weight of isolation presses heavily upon me. My knapsack, once filled with essentials, now feels unbearably light; whatever food and water I had initially scavenged have long since been consumed. The sound of my footsteps reverberates eerily through the empty streets, echoing no response. Every now and then, a faint groan reaches my ears, stirring Within me is an instinctual dread, knowing that the groans do not belong to the remnants of humanity but to a far less merciful predator. 

The sun begins its descent, and with it comes an increasing sense of urgency. I can feel the remnants of my courage draining from me as I realize I must find shelter before nightfall. The outskirts of the city are the only area I have not thoroughly searched yet, and so I hastened in that direction, each step fueled by a necessity for survival. As I approach the outskirts, my ears are assaulted by the sound of deep, guttural growls. My steps falter, and my heart pounds as I struggle to decide whether to push forward or turn back. The roof of a nearby building catches my attention, its jagged, broken shards silhouetted against the last remnants of daylight. Hastily, I scramble toward it, hoping to find refuge. 

The building is an old skyscraper, its once smooth surfaces now scarred and broken. I climb with pure desperation, muscles burning, hands slipping, lungs gasping for air. Finally, I make it to the top and collapse onto the rooftop, where I lie panting, my chest heaving with the exertion of the climb. With trembling hands, I unholster my weapon, my only defense against whatever creatures lurk in the darkness below. My fingers fumble over the weapon’s cold surface, the metallic scent of gunpowder lingering around me. The night is eerily silent, save for the sound of my breathing and the occasional distant howl. Leaning over the rooftop’s edge, I gaze down into the darkening streets below. 

Through the dim light, I can make out shapes, humanlike in form but grotesque. They move with an unnatural, jerking motion, their movements jerking and herky-jerky as if their joints were fused and atrophied. Their eyes, if they once had any, are long gone, replaced with black, soulless voids. Their flesh looks melted and distorted, pieces of clothing hanging off their decomposed bodies like shredded rags. The sight chills me to my core. 

Suddenly, I hear it - a guttural growl that sounds as if it came from beneath me. The sound is close, too close for comfort, and now I know with unyielding certainty that the creatures are no longer just in the streets below me; they are within the building, closing in on me. My heart hammers in my chest as I aim my weapon towards the source of the sound, preparing to defend myself against what may very well be my end. This is it.
