I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a cathedral of twilight—a sky stitched with threads of indigo and molten gold, where constellations drip liquid starlight onto a forest of trees that hum with bioluminescent whispers. Their leaves are shards of stained glass, refracting light into prismatic rivers that flow uphill, pooling in the hollows of floating stone islands. You walk barefoot on a path made of forgotten lullabies, each step releasing a soft, melodic chime. But beneath the wonder, a shadow gnaws—a cold, serrated voice that slithers through the beauty like a blade through silk.  

**“You’re clumsy,”** it hisses as you trip over a root that wasn’t there a moment ago. **“You always ruin the magic. Look how the stars recoil from you.”**  

You freeze. The voice is familiar, a relic of a thousand childhood missteps and adult failures, sharpened to a dagger’s edge. It materializes now as a creature—a towering wraith with a face of cracked obsidian mirrors, each shard reflecting a distorted version of you: smaller, weaker, flawed. Its fingers are broken compass needles, spinning wildly, and its breath smells of burnt paper and regret.  

**“You think you’re worthy of this dream?”** it sneers, its voice echoing like a collapsed bridge. **“You’ll never get it right. Even here, you’re a mistake.”**  

But something in you hardens. The dream pulses, sensing your resolve. The rivers of light slow, coalescing into a pool at your feet. You kneel and touch the surface. It ripples, revealing not your face, but a child’s—a version of you with eyes too wide for their sockets, clutching a broken kite in the rain. The memory is raw, but you don’t flinch.  

“I was never the mistake,” you murmur, the words trembling at first, then steadying. “You were.”  

The wraith recoils, its mirrors cracking further. You rise, scooping a handful of starlight from the air. It burns, but you hold it tight, letting it sear away the numbness. The dream shifts again: the forest bends inward, becoming a vast amphitheater of mirrors, each reflecting moments you’ve buried—your laughter, your courage, the time you stitched a wound with trembling hands but still *tried*. The voice screeches, but its power wanes as the light spreads.  

“You’re not my critic,” you say, now glowing with the warmth of a hundred reclaimed suns. “You’re my echo. And I’m done repeating you.”  

The wraith shatters like ice underfoot. Its shards dissolve into fireflies, flickering apologies as they vanish. The amphitheater melts back into the forest, but now the trees sing in harmony, their glass leaves ringing like bells. The path ahead glimmers, not with perfection, but with possibility—a mosaic of cracks and gold, inviting you to stumble, to dance, to *be*.  

You wake with the taste of starlight on your tongue, and for once, the silence inside is soft.
