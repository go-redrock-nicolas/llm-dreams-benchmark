I am dreaming. The air hums with the scent of burnt sugar and damp earth, thick and heavy. The sky stretches above me—not blue, not black, but a deep, shimmering violet, pulsing like the throat of some unseen beast. Stars drip from its expanse, smearing across the heavens like spilled paint, liquid and alive. I reach up, and they cling to my fingers, cold and electric, whispering in tongues I almost understand.  

Beneath my feet, the ground is soft, spongy—not soil, but something older. It breathes. Each step leaves an impression that slowly refills, as if the earth itself is swallowing my presence. The trees, twisted into impossible spirals, whisper as I pass. Their bark is smooth, slick with iridescent sap that shifts colors when touched, staining my fingertips with forgotten memories.  

A river cuts through the landscape, but the water doesn’t flow—it *crawls*. Transparent hands break its surface, grasping, beckoning. The current is made of voices, fragments of laughter and sobs all braided together. I crouch to listen, and a face ripples beneath the surface—mine, but not mine. It smiles with too many teeth before dissolving into the chorus.  

In the distance, a tower leans, defying gravity, its bricks bound by vines that pulse like veins. A door stands ajar, exhaling thick, cloying fog. Inside, something hums—a song I’ve heard before, in the space between waking and sleep. The air vibrates. My bones hum in harmony.  

Then—movement. Shadows detach from the walls, stretching like taffy, forming shapes just beyond recognition. They beckon, not with hands, but with something deeper—an inexorable pull in my chest, my gut, as if my very blood remembers their call.  

I take a step toward the tower.  

And then—  

I wake.  

But the scent of burnt sugar lingers.
