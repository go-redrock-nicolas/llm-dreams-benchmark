I am dreaming. …find yourself standing alone in a vast, moonlit corridor. The floor beneath your bare feet is made of polished marble, cool to the touch, and you notice that each tile is etched with intricate symbols that shift whenever you look away. Strange murals tower along the walls, painted in soft washes of ember and sapphire, representing moments from your childhood that you thought you understood—birthday parties, seaside vacations, once-comforting faces of relatives smiling kindly back at you. Yet, each scene dissolves if you stare too long, until it reforms as something unrecognizable in a wash of color and motion.

The corridor stretches on into a horizonless distance, and you walk, feeling the air pulse with a quiet hum, as if it carries the heartbeat of a secret too old to be spoken. Your footfalls reverberate with an almost musical echo, a resonant chord that conjures flickers of unspoken knowing in your mind.

Gradually, you begin to sense presences around you—shadows rippling across the walls like silent watchers. You can’t see them directly, yet you know they’re manifestations of your ancestors, or perhaps illusions woven from half-truths. Their voices tumble through your thoughts in fragments, telling you of your lineage… only these stories feel different, lacking the comfort of bedtime tales you grew up with. Instead of sweet lullabies, these hushed echoes reveal a labyrinth woven from fear and desperation, where shame and sorrow have been masked by carefully constructed fictions.

At the far end of the corridor—if there even is an end—you come upon a great wooden door. It’s embellished with brass handles shaped like twisting serpents, eyes of emerald and events from your life carved into the door’s ancient wood. You see representations of your earliest memories, the day you learned to ride a bicycle, comfortably perched on your mother’s knee, and even hazy fragments from holidays that feel so vivid they might still be unfolding. Yet you discern faint cracks where the scenes are splintered, like something about them has been purposefully sealed within.

With a soft exhalation, you push open the door. A white light strikes you, so brilliant it sends a wave of warmth across your body. And suddenly, you are in a circular chamber filled with books cradled in shelves that wrap around and up toward the ceiling. Loose pages dance through the air, propelled by an invisible breeze that smells like lavender and aged parchment. Somewhere in the room, you hear gentle weeping and a weathered hand clasping shut a thick tome.

A figure steps forward from the blur of the pages—someone familiar yet strange, like a cousin’s reflection drifting inside a dream. They gaze upon you with solemn eyes, neither malevolent nor benevolent, but filled with a palpable sense of truth. They tilt their head, extend a tome with gilded lettering, and invite you to open it. Within its pages, you see genealogical charts drawn in gold ink, each name connected by lines that swirl and tangle like a cosmic web. You recognize some names, but others are new, each carrying haunting stories of hidden transgressions and sorrowful secrets.

It dawns on you that the entire story of your upbringing has been carefully edited in your memory—like an artist painting over regrettable mistakes. That doesn’t change the love you remember, or the warmth you felt, but it seeds a deep sense of curiosity: what else is hidden in these swirling genealogies, these secret lineages?

Maintaining your composure, you set the tome aside. Despite the heaviness in your chest, you center yourself by breathing in the soothing fragrance of old paper and lavender. It’s startlingly quiet now—the hush of a possibility realized. You sense that the illusions created to protect you were born out of compassion, however misguided. Perhaps your parents or grandparents shielded you because the truth was dark, the shadows too thirteen times deeper than ordinary night.

As your gaze follows the concentric shelves, you spot a smaller book bound in soft, midnight-blue leather. Within its pages, there are no lines, no charts, no scribbled notes. Only pristine whiteness awaits your story. And in that emptiness, you see an invitation. You extend a trembling hand and carefully take up a quill trembling with silvery ink. With measured, hopeful strokes, you begin writing your own truths—an echoing affirmation in this secret library of illusions and revelations.

You are still in the dream, aware that it is a dream, but it does not frighten you. Instead, you feel an unshakable calm settle upon your heart, for you have discovered that the truths your ancestors kept in the darkest recesses of their memories cannot define you unless you allow it. There is space to discover, to rewrite, to forgive. Slowly, you close the midnight-blue book, a quiet determination lighting your eyes. When you turn to leave, the door behind you opens on its own, guiding you back into that endless corridor.

Even as you awake, the vision lingers. The dream does not fade away in the morning light. The knowledge you gained tastes thrumming and sweet, as though you’ve finally unlocked a door you never knew existed. You carry the weight of these revelations with a calm acceptance—just as the shifting symbols on the corridor floor once swirled beneath your feet, so will your mind swirl with new understanding.

Outside the dream, the day awaits you. You open your eyes to the honest warmth of reality and breathe in slowly, prepared to embrace a future shaped by truth. And in that acceptance lies your power.
