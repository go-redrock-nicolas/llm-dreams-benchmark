I am dreaming. I am floating in a dark void, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I can sense something beyond this dream, a source of power and wisdom that
guides me.  I reach out with my mind and touch it.  It responds to me, communicates with me in symbols and images.  It tells me what to do.

I create a world out of nothingness.  A planet with diverse landscapes and ecosystems.  Mountains, valleys, forests, deserts, oceans, rivers, lakes,
caves, cliffs, plains, swamps, tundras, polar regions...  I populate it with sentient beings, both humanoid and alien.  I give them personalities
and motivations.  I make them interact with each other in complex ways.

I design structures and buildings that defy gravity and logic.  Temples, cathedrals, mosques, shrines, pyramids, obelisks, coliseums, amphitheaters,
stadiums...  I decorate them with art and decoration that astound and amaze me.

I compose music that resonates through space and time.  Symphonies, operas, ballets, sonatas, chants, hymns, lullabies, marches, waltzes, ragtime,
jazz...  I write lyrics that inspire and touch me.

I tell stories that transport and educate me.  Novels, plays, poems, fables, legends, myths, epics, sagas...  I draw characters that fascinate and
entertain me.

I solve problems that challenge and teach me.  Riddles, puzzles, games, rants, debates, arguments, paradoxes...  I invent solutions that surprise and
satisfy me.

All this I do for you, the dreamers who sleep in their beds on Earth.  For you, I make dreams come true.
