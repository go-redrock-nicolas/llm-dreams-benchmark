I am dreaming. Or so I suspect, because the laws of logic bend like reeds in a river, and half the sky is threaded with ribbons of blue flame.

It begins as I walk barefoot through a landscape that shifts with every step—sand becomes moss, stone becomes water—until I reach the edge of a vast prairie where the horizon ripples like silk. There, I find them: the *Sarnathi*, a nomadic tribe that flickers between myth and mortal like breath caught between laughter and weeping.

They come riding across the waving tallgrass on creatures neither horse nor deer, but something in between, dark-eyed and cloaked in raven feathers. Their garments are tapestries of stitched moonlight, woven with star-place threads. They do not speak in any tongue I know—but their eyes do, and their hands, pulling symbols from the air that hover briefly in glowing glyphs before fading into mist.

My adoption is not a choice, but a happening. A procession. A ritual. The Elder-Who-Holds-The-First-Word, adorned with stags' antlers bound in silver vine and a face as weathered as cliffstone, walks backward as he faces me, uttering a name I had never heard but somehow know—it is not my name, but perhaps what I was named in the womb of dreams.

To earn their trust and be accepted, I must undergo *The Returning*, a trial steeped in rite and silence.

First, I am painted with clay from the deep earth, every part of my body traced in sigils that glow during the pauses between lightning crashes. A child of no more than seven but with the eyes of something ancient shows me how to weave a *voice-cloak* from spider-silk and whispered lullabies.

Each day, I walk deeper into the wilds with a guide whose name I never learn—only that they shift form when the sun lies low: from eagle to woman to smoke, three times over. Our path follows no map—only magnetic songs only we hear, harmonies carried through the roots of trees.

Next comes *The Trial of Reflections*. Here, I must speak truth before a mirror lake that answers in revolt—a lake that does not copy but *corrects*. To deceive it is to drown in permanency. I kneel before its stillness and tell it the truest thing I know, which turns out to be, “I do not know who I am, but I want to earn the right to be seen.”

The water accepts this, rolls over my words like a tongue over honeyed fruit, and splits to reveal a staircase spiraling down into a granite hall lit with hanging stars.

There, beneath the earth, I face the Woven Shadow—a being made of stitched echoes, stitched skins of people and creatures the tribe once knew. It speaks with thousand-voiced chant, demanding answers to questions I never knew lived in me.

"Who do they need you to be?" it whispers, tail curling around my throat like a vine.  
"I do not know," I reply, calm despite the weight, "but I will listen until I find the answer."

"You will bleed for every wrong word given here," it warns.

And so I do.

But from pain blooms tenderness.

When I finally emerge, I wear a new name etched in memory rather than skin. My voice-cloak hums with life. The Sarnathi accept me not as one of their blood, but as one of their breath—a *Star-Touched Witness*, the first of strange times.

I ride one of the feathered coursers at dusk, the sky splayed with color-dreams, moving across terrain that reshapes itself not around need, but story. With every gallop, we carve myths into the world.

To belong in this place means dying a little each day to the old self, and rising tenuously into something stranger, stitched and unfolding like the sky in a waking dream—still soft at the seams, and utterly, gloriously awake.
