I am dreaming. I am walking through a forest that breathes peace—golden light filters through a canopy of emerald leaves, casting dappled shadows on the moss-covered floor. The air is thick with the scent of wild jasmine and rain that hasn't yet fallen, a promise of nature’s pulse beneath my silent steps. Birds sing like forgotten lullabies, and the wind carries whispers, soft and unintelligible, calling from the deep green unknown. I am completely alone, but not afraid. The forest is my companion, its heartbeat steady in the sway of the trees.

And then, the world inhales.

A hush invades the scene. The birds stop singing. The leaves go still mid-dance. Even the roots beneath seem to tighten, bracing. I feel it in my bones—a shift in the air, a pressure low and humming, like an unseen weight settling on my shoulders.

The sky darkens. Not slowly, but with violence, as if a hand has yanked a curtain across the heavens. Clouds, black and glowering, gather like an enemy horde. They churn and twist, bruised purple lightning flashing within them, like the sky itself is suffering a seizure. The wind returns—not gentle now, but fierce and possessive—tearing through the trees, making branches writhe like panicked limbs. Leaves whip through the air, a chaotic rain of emerald and amber.

I stand still as the storm gathers around me. The once-familiar forest starts to twist, the trees growing taller, impossibly so, their trunks knotted with ancient scars and eyes that blink slowly from the bark. Roots emerge like jagged teeth from the forest floor, yawning open to reveal depths that shimmer with ghost-light. The moss beneath my feet pulses—alive—like a heartbeat.

Then comes the rain.

Not in drops but in torrents, hot and cold at once. It doesn't soak me—instead, it *seeps*. The water enters me—not through pores, but through thoughts, whispering secrets against the inside of my skull. Words and regrets, memories of lives I never lived flood me, a deluge of unbearable clarity and wonder.

The sky splits open with thunder that doesn’t sound like sound at all—more like the roar of some celestial titan being born from the void. I look up and see that the clouds are not clouds at all, but the feathers of an enormous winged figure—an entity shaped like a memory I cannot grasp, cloaked in shadow and lightning, beckoning me from above.

I take a step forward. Then another. My feet no longer feel the earth. I’m walking on raw energy, on waves of sound, on breath itself. The storm is not something outside of me now. It *is* me—my fears, my longing, my unspoken dreams made manifest in icy winds and thunderous purpose.

And somewhere within the maelstrom, a path unfolds—not on the ground, but in the air—a road of shimmering light, spiraling upward into the eye of the storm, where answers bloom and madness dances with divinity.

I take the first step onto that aerial path.

And it *sings.*
