I am dreaming. At first, the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and old paper, and I stand in a vast library where the shelves stretch endlessly into shadow. The books have no titles—only spiraling symbols that shift when I blink. I run my fingers along the spines, feeling the hum of stories waiting to be plucked like ripe fruit.  

Then, without warning, I'm at a dinner party. The guests have no faces, only shifting masks that flicker between expressions—smiles dissolving into sneers, laughter lines folding into grimaces. Someone asks me about my life, and the lies begin to flow like honey.  

*"Oh, I was raised by wolves in the Carpathian Mountains,"* I say, and instantly, the room shudders. The guests murmur, intrigued, the air thickening with their curiosity. Their featureless faces lean closer. Now, I feel compelled to embellish.  

*"Not just any wolves,"* I continue. *"Silver-furred, with eyes like cracked amber. They taught me to speak in howls that carried the secrets of the forest."* The walls around me ripple like liquid, and suddenly I *remember* it—the sharp scent of pine, the piercing cold of mountain winds, the taste of raw venison between my teeth.  

But something is wrong.  

The more I speak, the more the dream twists around my words, reshaping itself to fit the lie. The floor creaks, and beneath my feet, I see that it’s made of brittle pages—covered in my own handwriting, the ink still wet. The words are shifting in real time, rewriting themselves to match my story.  

A woman with a mask of mirrored shards asks, *"Is any of this true?"* and my mouth moves before I can stop it.  

*"Of course,"* I say. *"Truth is just the lie you commit to."*  

The walls dissolve into ash. The library is gone. Now, I’m standing at the edge of a vast, black ocean, watching false memories wash ashore like rotting shipwrecks. Each wave brings a new story I’ve told, a new version of me—*I was a pianist who never learned to play, a soldier who never held a gun, a lover who was never loved.* The water laps at my ankles, whispering, *"Which one of these is really you?"*  

I open my mouth to answer.  

And then I wake—heart pounding, skin damp, mouth still tasting the salt of the lies I swallowed.
