I am dreaming. The air is thick with anticipation, my breath hitching in my throat as I step into the spotlight.  The stage is massive, a cathedral of cobalt and silver, its curves like liquid metal.  Somewhere in the dark beyond the footlights, thousands of faces blur into a sea of expectation.  I can taste the metallic tang of the microphone, its cold surface a grounding anchor as I open my mouth to sing... and nothing happens.  My voice vanishes.  The notes I’ve rehearsed until muscle memory could carry them in my sleep refuse to emerge. 

But then—a flicker.  A memory surfaces, not of scales or practiced songs, but of a forgotten childhood game where I’d hum melodies to make the wind dance in an oak tree’s branches.  Tentatively, I try again, this time without the forced precision.  The first note shivers out, raw and unpolished, and the room stills.  Then, as if woken by the sound, the very walls of the venue thrum in reply.  The lights beneath me pulse like a heartbeat, and the crowd’s breath catches as my voice reshapes itself into something wilder, stranger—a symphony of improvisation fueled by panic and wonder.  Above the stage, the ceiling peels back, dissolving into a starless night, and the building’s architecture melts into a labyrinth of glowing vines and bioluminescent flowers.  I stumble forward, guided not by notes on a page but by the laughter of a chorus of shadows that flicker in and out of the flora, their voices weaving with mine.  

The song becomes a race against gravity, my heels sinking into the floor as the stage transforms into a winding staircase spiraling into the sky.  Each step alters the music’s key, the notes shifting to accommodate the vertiginous ascent.  Above me, constellations ignite in response to crescendos, their patterns rearranging like living sheet music.  I am no longer singing—I’m lassoing the air itself, bending the night into a collaborator.  When the final note evaporates, I stand amidst the ruins of a temple made of sound, the crowd either applauding or silent, their faces now indistinct against the dawn’s first pale blush.  The dream ends not with a bow, but with a whisper: *Was that the performance—or a beginning*?
