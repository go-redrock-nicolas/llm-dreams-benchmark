I am dreaming. —I find myself floating midway between the bustling halls of a United Nations summit and the sun-drenched libraries of ancient Alexandria. Around me, language is both a melody and a current, an infinite prism of shifting words. I am learning seven languages all at once: the rolling cadences of Italian, the crisp click consonants of Xhosa, the gentle waves of Japanese, the ornate structures of Russian, the rhythmic poetry of Arabic, the twisting tones of Mandarin, and the earthy warmth of Swahili.

Each language is a room in a vast palace inside my mind. As I walk the endless carpeted corridors, I hear snippets from each tongue—soft greetings, passionate arguments, whispered secrets—echoing from behind every intricate door.

Suddenly, my mission takes shape. I see hundreds of delegates waiting in a marble hall whose columns spiral endlessly upward, draped with glowing banners—their colors become words themselves. There’s a hush, electrifying the air. My head spins. I reach for a phrase in Mandarin, but French rushes forward instead, twining with unfamiliar Xhosa syllables, words blooming and colliding like fireworks until I’m speaking a language no one has ever heard before. 

The delegates lean closer, puzzled and then entranced, as if I’m casting a spell. My sentences curve into pictograms and dance around the room, lifting into the air where they turn into iridescent birds. Each tongue merges into another, a kaleidoscope of meaning. I realize that my struggle isn’t confusion, but creation—each misunderstanding becomes a bridge, every slip a new possibility.

Swept up in the dream logic, I rise above the gathering, languages streaming behind me in shimmering ribbons. In a flash of insight, I understand: I’m not just speaking languages—I am them. I am the hope in a greeting, the sharpness in a warning, the tenderness in a lullaby. 

As the dream deepens, faces from every country merge and separate, their expressions shaped by my hovering, ever-changing words. The room fills with shared understanding, laughter, and tears, a symphony painted in language, and for a moment I know: the world can be united—not by perfect translation, but by the fearless blending of our deepest stories.

Somewhere, distant yet near, a bell chimes, and I awaken—tongue-tied but radiant, heart pounding with the echo of a thousand unspoken dreams.
