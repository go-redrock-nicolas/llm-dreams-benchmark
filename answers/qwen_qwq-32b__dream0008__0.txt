I am dreaming. I open my eyes and find myself back at... *my old workplace*. But something is... different. The fluorescent lights hum in that familiar, annoying way, but the office walls are covered in glowing vines, twisting up the cubicles like neon-green serpents. My desk is there, with my old coffee mug half-full of something that might once have been liquid, now emitting a soft, foggy blue glow. I pick it up, and the mug shimmers, the steam curling into shapes: calendar dates, flashing red notifications, acounting diagrams that I need to urgently finish...\n\n**Boss’s Voice (from the intercom):** "Ms. Projects? I know you’re there. The client is insisting on the impossible — a skyscraper modeled in pixels, rendered in 14 days. Twelve, if you count backwards. The deadline is a shooting star... you have to *catch it before it burns out*. They’ve already broken three contractors this week. But you’re... special. You’ve always been my star employee. Get to work."\n\nI look around. The vines have grown thicker, their leaves now flickering with the codes of CAD software. My keyboard has turned into a portal, its letters replaced with buttons labeled: “Panorama 3.0”, “Fullscreen Grid”, and “Ephemera Capture.” When I tap “Panorama 3.0”, my cube wall dissolves, and I’m floating above a cityscape built of time-lapse clouds. The buildings are half-unbuilt, their steel bones visible through translucent glass. The client’s faces flicker into the skyscraper windows — a young CEO with a monocle made of binary code, an elderly art patron whose wrinkles are equations...\n\nThe vines tighten. The coffee mug’s steam forms a countdown clock. **Seven days.** I have to sync the phases of the moon to the building’s scaffold, etch the client’s childhood memories into the lobby’s marble flooring, and make sure the elevator’s acceleration matches the heart rate of someone’s first kiss.\n\n**Boss’s Voice Again:** "Ah, you’ve noticed your tools. That’s a start. Now remember: creativity is your oxygen. There’s no 'undo' button here. Every keystroke becomes reality. Spill a pixel, and it’ll rain here until you fix it. Miss a deadline, and everything? *Collapse.* I’ll leave you to it. Good luck."\n\nThe room tilts. The vines *shriek*. My reflection in the monitor has a mosaic of my past selves staring back — the graduate student, the overworked freelancer, the burnout who quit. They’re all met with a single word behind them, in blood-red letters:** "END UNIT."**
