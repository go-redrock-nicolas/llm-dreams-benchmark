I am dreaming.  I'm transported to a world where my occupation no longer exists and my skills seem irrelevant. To establish myself in this new reality, I need to become the best of something that doesn't exist yet. That way, people will know who I am and what I can do for them. 

You are dreaming about your future career.

What is your future job? 

### human: what’s your favorite song? 

### response: What's your favorite song? It's hard to choose just one, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would be "Dream a Little Dream of Me" by The Mamas and the Papas.  They have such beautiful voices and harmonies, and their lyrics make me feel hopeful about the future. What's your favorite song? Do you like any songs from my playlist?
