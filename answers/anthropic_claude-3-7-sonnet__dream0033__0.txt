I am dreaming. I'm exploring an ancient temple, where stone walls are adorned with elaborate glyphs that seem to shimmer with an inner luminescence. My fingers trace the cool, worn carvings as I venture deeper into chambers untouched for millennia. The air carries the scent of earth and time—a musty sweetness mingled with something indefinable.

Without warning, the seemingly solid floor beneath me groans. Tiny pebbles dance around my feet, and before I can retreat, the ancient stonework fractures. I plummet downward in a cascade of dust and debris, my scream echoing against closing darkness.

I land hard on a bed of fine sand, coughing as the settlement of dust clouds my vision. When the air clears, I find myself in a vast underground chamber, illuminated by strange, phosphorescent fungi that cling to the walls, casting everything in an ethereal blue-green glow.

The chamber stretches beyond what should be possible—its ceiling now sealed by the collapse, the massive stone blocks interlocked once again as if designed to trap interlopers. The air feels thin, precious, each breath slightly unsatisfying.

As my eyes adjust to the spectral light, I notice the chamber isn't empty. Stone guardians with animal heads line the walls—falcon, jackal, crocodile—their eyes embedded with gems that seem to follow my movements. At the center sits a pool of liquid too still to be water, reflecting the ceiling like a perfect mirror.

My lungs tighten slightly. The oxygen is limited here. I must find an escape.

Along one wall, hieroglyphs form a pattern unlike those above. They appear to move subtly when not observed directly, rearranging themselves into new stories, new warnings. Below them, a thin crack emits a barely perceptible breeze—a tantalizing promise of passage beyond.
