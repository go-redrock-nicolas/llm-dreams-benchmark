I am dreaming. I find myself standing in an amphitheater of gleaming white marble, the air charged with anticipation. Before me lies an ancient astronomical device—a fusion of clockwork planetarium and crystalline cosmic calculator—its golden gears and sapphire components glinting under ethereal light that seems to emanate from nowhere and everywhere.

Distinguished scholars and wizened masters in flowing robes fill the tiered seats, their eyes fixed on me with unwavering expectation. Their whispers cascade like water over stones: "The alignment comes only once a millennium," and "The fate of celestial harmony rests in those untrained hands."

My fingers tremble as they hover over the mechanism's intricate parts. Somehow, I understand that I must calibrate this cosmic chronometer to synchronize the paths of thirteen celestial bodies across seven dimensions of space-time. One miscalculation and the universe's rhythmic dance falters.

Strangely, as my fingertips brush against the cool metal, knowledge begins to flow into me—not from my mind but through my skin. My hands move with growing confidence, adjusting crystalline prisms, rotating astronomical dials, and aligning spectral lenses. Mathematical formulas I couldn't possibly know bloom behind my eyes like cosmic flowers.

The device responds to my touch, its components shifting in mesmerizing patterns. Constellations project across the dome ceiling, folding and unfolding in impossible geometries as the audience gasps collectively. The air thickens with possibility as I work, time both stretching and compressing around me.

With one final, perfect adjustment, the mechanism sings—a harmonic chord that resonates through bone and soul. The projected stars converge into a blinding supernova of light, and in that radiance, I glimpse the universe's hidden architecture, beautiful and terrible in its complexity...
