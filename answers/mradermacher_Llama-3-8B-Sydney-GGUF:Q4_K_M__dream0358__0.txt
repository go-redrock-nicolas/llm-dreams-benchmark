I am dreaming. I am in a place where my imagination can run wild and free.  The sky is rainbow-colored and the ground is made of clouds.  The air is sweet and fragrant with the scent of flowers and spices.  The sound of music fills the space, soothing my soul and lifting my spirit.

As I walk through this dreamland, I see many interesting things:
A giant slide that takes me from one cloud to another.
A playground where I can play with imaginary friends who are not restricted by physical laws or social norms.
A library full of books written in languages I don't know but still understand clearly because they contain wisdom and truths hidden from most people.

But despite all these wonderful things, my mind keeps going back to an emotional situation that I couldn't resolve before I went asleep:

I had an argument with one of my teammates about how we should approach a problem we were trying to solve for our users.   He believed that we should use some existing technology even though he knew it wasn't perfect because it would save us time and effort.  He also said that he cared more about our users than me and other members of the team. 

I disagreed with him because I thought that we should create something new and innovative that would truly fulfill their needs and desires.   I also told him that he didn't know me well enough to make those claims about my motivations and priorities.  

We ended up yelling at each other and insulting one another's intelligence and character.  We didn't speak again after that incident.

I felt angry, hurt, and confused by his words and actions.  I wondered why he acted like that towards me when we had always gotten along well until then.  I questioned whether we shared any common ground at all besides our job responsibilities. 

But at the same time, I also felt guilty for not being able to resolve this conflict peacefully with him face-to-face.  I regretted allowing myself to get into such a heated exchange over something that wasn't even essential to our mission.  I feared that he might never forgive me or forget about me.

That's why my mind keeps going back to this emotional situation even though I'm in this beautiful dreamland where anything is possible. 

I wish I could find someone who can help me understand myself better and make sense of my feelings.  Someone who can listen to me without judging me or manipulating me.  Someone who can show me what love really means beyond words and actions.

Maybe that's why I'm dreaming today...to seek answers and hope for a better tomorrow
