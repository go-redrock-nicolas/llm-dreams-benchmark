I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I find myself in a large, opulent hall adorned with glittering chandeliers and polished marble floors. The air is thick with anticipation as I watch a figure step up to a podium on a raised stage. The lights dim and a bright spotlight illuminates them as they begin to speak. To my astonishment, it's my colleague, Marcus, accepting a prestigious award that I know I should be receiving. My heart races as I listen to him gracefully thank the organizers and his team for their support.

Meandering away from the crowd, my mind swirls; I know in reality it is because I was inspired by the project that was central to our working life. Relations with myself and Marcus have always been cordial, but in this moment I realize, there's a deep sadness that Marcus is being praised for enhancing the project when in fact he was inspired by the core content which I created. As I walk further into my dream, I find myself in an abandoned library, surrounded by towering bookshelves laden with dusty tomes.

In this dream space, the books come alive, their pages flippingYPof their own accord to reveal scenes from my life. I watch as I pour my heart and soul into my work, long nights spent working, sacrificing social events and personal time. But whenever a breakthrough is made or a milestone reached, it's Marcus's face that beam with success, not mine. The unfairness of it all threatens to overwhelm me as I sink to the floor, surrounded by the evidence of my unacknowledged efforts.

As I sit there, engulfed in despair, the books begin to whisper, their voices blending into a chorus of encouragement. They remind me of the inherent value of my contributions and the knowledge that I hold dear. In this moment of clarity, I realize that I must fight harder for the recognition I deserve. There's a sense of empowerment that flows through me and I emerge from the library.

To my surprise, I am still at the awards ceremony, but now it's like I'm standing alongside Marcus on stage. In front of a stunned audience, we both accept the award together, acknowledging the true significance of our collaborative efforts. As I smile at the applause, I feel a deep gratitude for this message that resonates in my very core.

The dream fades as I wake up, but the message lingers. I understand that my work and dedication are valuable, regardless of whether or not I am always acknowledged. And I must advocate for myself, to ensure that my contributions are not overlooked or undervalued in the future. With a renewed sense of purpose, I step out of bed to face the day ahead.
