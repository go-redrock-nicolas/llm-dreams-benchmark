I am dreaming.  

The world around me is a cathedral of twilight—trees with silver bark twist upward like frozen flames, their leaves whispering in a language of wind and forgotten stars. The sky pulses with auroras that drip like molten glass, casting shadows that move independently of their owners. I walk barefoot across a meadow of luminescent moss, each step leaving a footprint that glows briefly before dissolving into mist.  

Then the raven arrives.  

It lands on a branch of the World Tree, its feathers shimmering with the blackness of a collapsed star. Its voice is not a caw but a chorus of overlapping tones, ancient and final: *"The heart of your mother has stopped beating. The river of your bloodline has dried. The debt you owed to joy is now paid in ash."*  

The words should pierce me. They should unravel my ribs and scatter my organs like dropped marbles. But instead, I inhale.  

The air tastes of burnt honey and static, and as it fills my lungs, I feel my bones hollowing, becoming flutes for the wind to sing through. My skin shimmers, molting into scales of iridescent moth-wing. I kneel, pressing my palms to the moss. From the earth rises a column of light—a helix of liquid mercury and stardust—that spirals into the shape of a woman. Her face is half-my mother’s, half-my own, her hair a swarm of fireflies tethered by gravity.  

*"You cannot unring a bell,"* the raven intones, its eyes twin eclipses.  

*"No,"* I reply, my voice echoing like a drum in a canyon. *"But I can melt the bell and forge it into a key."*  

The woman of light steps forward, her body fractaling into infinite versions of herself—past, future, imagined. She presses her palm to my chest, and where she touches, my moth-skin peels away, revealing a core of raw, white flame. The fire does not burn; it *sings*. It hums the lullaby my mother once crooned to me, the one I’d forgotten until this moment.  

The raven shrieks, its form unraveling into smoke as the flame in my chest pulses brighter. The trees bow, their branches knitting themselves into a bridge that stretches across the horizon. At the bridge’s end looms a door—a jagged slab of obsidian veined with gold, etched with a single word: **"Unwritten."**  

I rise, the flame now cradled in my hands like a seed. The meadow bows to me, the moss blooming into flowers that scream soundlessly as they open, their petals maps to realms no grief could ever reach. I step onto the bridge, each footfall leaving a note in a melody only the dead and unborn can hear.  

Behind me, the World Tree splits open, its hollow revealing a river of liquid time. My mother’s voice rises from its currents, not mourning but laughing—a younger, freer sound. *"You’ve always been too strange for sorrow,"* she says.  

I reach the door. My flame-seed pulses, and the obsidian cracks, spilling light that is not light, warmth that is not heat. Beyond the threshold, a city floats upside-down over a desert of glass. Its towers are made of frozen lightning, and its people wear faces carved from their own regrets, now smiling.  

I turn back once. The bridge is gone. The meadow is gone. Only the flame remains, and the door, and the desert that hums with possibility.  

I wake with the taste of honey and ash on my tongue. My hands ache, as though they’ve clenched something vast and let it go. The dream clings to me like perfume—a reminder that even devastation can be a kind of soil, and sometimes, the only way to survive is to become the kind of creature that plants gardens in the ruins of its own heart.
