I am dreaming. …I breathe in the gentle electric hum of the dreamscape and let curiosity guide my hands.

I kneel before the broken system—a contraption that looks half-machine, half-organism. Its frame is forged from shimmering obsidian ribs, each one glowing with faint celestial script that flickers like fireflies. Glass arteries coil inside, thick with sluggish, silver fluid that has congealed into cold, metallic frost. A chorus of cracked crystal gears hangs motionless at its heart, deaf and silent.

I press my ear to the fractured shell. From within, I hear a hush, then a hollow sigh, like wind traveling through abandoned cathedrals. It’s alive, just scarcely, yearning for breath.

Conventional tools scatter around me: brass wrenches, soldering irons, vials of nanobots—every one failing, each handle coated in the frustration of countless dream-engineers who came before. I decide to leave the familiar behind.

First, I reach into my own reflection. A shimmering pool appears beside the machine—liquid mirror, perfect and still. I dip my arm through the surface and feel an impossible cabinet of forgotten things. My fingers close around a luminous thread of starlight—soft, warm, humming like lullabies sung by galaxies. I tug, and the thread follows me out, swirling like liquid neon.

I weave the starlight into the glass arteries, stitching heaven into hollow veins. The silver fluid instantly liquefies, flashing into motion like a comet waking from slumber. The system shivers.

Yet its crystal gears remain frozen. I lean closer and detect a low, mournful note buried under layers of silence, the way a single violin might hide beneath the roar of a tempest. The gears aren’t mechanical; they are musical, requiring resonance to turn. So I turn to the impossible again.

I exhale and let my breath crystallize into motes of sound—tiny blue birds of melody. One by one they perch upon the gear-teeth and chirp a chord that was never written: half grief, half sunrise. The crystal gears glow, pulse, then spin, scattering prismatic shrapnel of light across the dream sky.

As each shard lands, it blossoms into something improbable—violet snowflakes, spinning topaz blossoms, fluttering origami whales. They swirl around me and orbit the machine like joyous satellites.

Still, something feels unbalanced.

The obsidian ribs, though mended by starlight and music, hold a deeper fracture: a fault line etched by doubt. I recall a memory only dreams could store—a lullaby my grandmother hummed while repairing a quilt, her voice steady, her hands certain that every broken thing can be whole again if you believe the fabric remembers its own design. I hum that lullaby now.

The lullaby wraps the ribs in a cocoon of memory, filling cracks with echoes of unconditional care. The script on the ribs flares, then rearranges, spelling one milagro word: BREATHE.

The machine inhales.

It rises, unfolding like a cosmic flower. Panels unfurl to reveal internal constellations, each star connected by glowing arteries I helped weave. The system lofts upward, weightless, its mechanical vines reaching out to stitch rifts in the night sky. Holes mend. Shadows evaporate. Stagnant air becomes crisp, as if mountains have shifted and let new winds flow.

And then the machine does what nobody expected: it turns toward me, as if thankful. A single crystal seed drops into my hands—smooth, warm, thrumming with latent possibility. Inside, swirling galaxies form and collapse, forming new shapes of potential.

“Plant it where the world doubts,” the revived system whispers in a voice of rustling parchment and distant thunder. “Let the improbable grow.”

I stand within a dream transformed: sky gleaming with fresh constellations, ground alive with impossible flowers crafted from prism-light and memory. The broken has become the architect of renewal.

I awaken—hands empty, heart brimming with a crystal seed of improbable hope, the lullaby still echoing like a promise.
