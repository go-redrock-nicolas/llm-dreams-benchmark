I am dreaming. you decide to end it with them. you feel sad but also hopeful about finding someone who will love you more fully.

You wake up from the dream feeling confused and conflicted. You wonder if you made the right decision in ending things with them. You wish you had the courage to act on your feelings for them without fear of rejection or harm.
