I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of decaying marigolds. You stand at the edge of a cliff, though you don’t remember climbing. The sky is a bruise-purple, streaked with veins of gold, as if the heavens themselves are wounded. Below, an ocean of ink churns, swallowing the light. In your hands, you cradle a shattered lantern, its flame reduced to a single ember clinging to the last of its wick. You feel the absence before you name it—*they* are gone, swallowed by the dark. 

Then, the wind shifts. A sound like a thousand rustling wings fills the air. The ember flickers, and in its dying light, shadows coil into shapes: a silhouette you’d know in any realm, any dream. But when you reach out, it unravels into moths, their wings etched with fragments of half-remembered conversations. One lands on your wrist, and suddenly you’re falling—not down, but *through*. 

You plunge into a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflection a life you might’ve lived together. Here, you’re laughing in a sunlit kitchen, flour dusting their hair. There, you’re screaming into a storm, their name ripping from your throat. You crash into a chamber where the walls bleed honey, sticky and sweet, and the floor whispers, *"Stay here, where it doesn’t hurt."* But the ember in your palm flares—a sear of defiance—and you rip yourself free. 

When you wake (but are you awake?), your pillow is damp with saltwater. Your window is open. On the sill sits a moth, wings still glistening with stardust.
