I am dreaming. …find yourself standing barefoot on a ribbon-thin bridge of stained-glass that hovers just above an ink-black sea. Every pane beneath your toes glows with its own inner light—turquoise, ember-red, moonlit silver—so that each cautious step paints ripples of color across the dark water below. Above, the night sky coils and uncoils like living velvet, constellations rearranging themselves into unfamiliar alphabets the moment you try to read them.

Almost immediately a storm gathers on the horizon, born from ten-thousand whispering voices. It races toward you, a wall of wind scribbled with lightning. You feel the familiar tug of urgency and notice the first pattern: you do not flee. Instead, you begin to calculate, mapping unseen anchors in your mind, planning how you will bend instead of break. In waking life you often meet upheaval the same way—eyes narrowed, pulse even, building mental scaffolding before the world can collapse. The storm tears across the stained-glass bridge, yet the glass does not shatter, because you instruct the colors themselves to braid into a prism shell around you. You learn: you are a strategist who will coax order from chaos rather than run from it.

The storm passes, and the bridge arches into a lush valley stitched entirely from pages of books you once loved. Paper trees rustle with printed leaves; rivers of liquid ink curve between storybound hills. A colossal door of unmarked parchment stands in your path. There is no lock, no handle—only silence. You place your palm against it and speak a single line from a poem you wrote and never showed anyone. The door dissolves. Here is your second pattern: where others might force entry, you negotiate. In your challenges you often offer vulnerability first, trusting that an honest phrase can loosen bolts better than iron tools. You realize your instinct is to meet resistance with intimacy.

Beyond the door, the valley narrows into a chasm whose walls are lined with mirrors fogged by drifting breath. Each mirror reflects your face at a different age—child, lover, skeptic, believer—yet every reflection mouths the same question: “What do we protect?” A stone path meanders between the mirrors, but some slabs are missing, hovering inches apart over endless depth. Without hesitating, you extend a hand to your childhood reflection. Glass becomes flesh; the youngster steps out and together you leap the gap. You discover a third pattern: you recruit forgotten versions of yourself in times of peril, stitching past courage and future hope into present action. Your strength is a chorus, never a solo.

At last the bridge of stained-glass re-emerges, carrying you toward a horizon where dawn glows lavender. You pause, sensing the dream thinning like mist. Three truths crystallize in the hush:

1. When turmoil surges, your first instinct is to architect solutions, turning fear into geometry.  
2. You disarm obstacles with authenticity; your secrets are keys, not barricades.  
3. You survive by communion—inviting every former self to stand beside you until the crowd of you is large enough to walk on air.

The sea below grows still, reflecting the warming sky. You inhale, exhale, and feel yourself waking, bridge fading beneath your feet, yet those insights remain—vivid shards of dream-glass now lodged like bright compass needles inside your steady, waking heart.
