I am dreaming. The setting is a sprawling, oppressive urban landscape that stretches endlessly in all directions, the buildings jagged and asymmetrical, like broken teeth left jagged from neglect. The sky above is churned into a nonstop monsoon, the rain coming down in sheets so thick I can barely see objects three feet away. I’m standing at a makeshift command center built from stacked sandbags and frayed tarp, surrounded by a haphazard collection of radios, broken computer monitors, and maps that seem to shift and rearrange themselves just beyond my attention span.

A voice crackles over an ancient radio — it’s one of my field teams. They’re reporting from the low-lying district that’s been underwater for three days. The civilians trapped there are clinging to rooftops that are now islands, surrounded by the churning, trash-filled floodwaters. The transmission is static-ridden but urgent: they need boats by dawn. Otherwise, many won’t survive the night.

Meanwhile, our supply depot’s inventory has just vanished from all systems. The inventory screen flashes in red, item counts dwindle before my eyes. Where did the rubber dinghies and insulin vials and children’s coats go? A radio in my pocket squawks a different crisis: an outbreak of something unnamed, a cough that turns the insides to glass. Frantic nurses describe patients convulsing, blood vessels fracturing under the pressure. The medication for this “glass plague” was part of the missing supplies.

The tactical map on the central table flickers occasionally. A red dot flashes in the northeast quadrant. A lab that once housed the cure for the glass plague is now run by a militia that’s turned violent. They’re demanding a shipment of solar panels we can’t spare to power their generators. But the solar panels are needed to desalinate seawater for the drought-stricken high-rise towers on the western edge of the compound — people there haven’t had fresh water in weeks.

I grip a stylus trembling in my hand, inputting data into a simulation that’s supposed to model all these variables but keeps glitching, lines of algorithm code flipping into hieroglyphics before reverting. The screen reads: “OPTIMAL SOLUTION NOT FOUND. RECOMMEND ACCEPTANCE OF UNLIKELY OUTCOMES.”

Through the rain, a figure emerges from the gloom. It’s someone from my past, a mentor who died years ago, their face half-concealed by a respirator mask streaked with condensation. They hand me a tablet, its surface glowing with a fractal map of the city’s waterways and above-ground piping. “The solution is in the flow,” they say, voice distorted, “but you have to let go of the grid.”

The city itself seems alive now, reacting to every decision, the monsoon winds stronger when I divert too much aid north, the faucets of the high-rises sputtering when I allocate to the flooding districts. I realize that the missing supplies were taken by scavengers who’ve turned into a migratory swarm, following the weakest points of the disaster’s geometry. 

I decide to weaponize the flood. To redirect part of the torrent using the old subway tunnels, both to create pathways for the engineers with the boats and to flush out the scavengers into zones… where maybe the militia will take them on, giving me a temporary respite. 

The system glitches again, but this time, the code fractures into glowing, bioluminescent pathways — veins of light showing water, resources, and people converging at a clock tower in the city’s abandoned industrial sector. Against protocol, I order all remaining resources — the solar panels, the vaccines — to be trucked there during the upcoming rainfall lull.

I don’t know what I’m doing. I know I don’t. But the fractal map on the tablet my mentor gave me begins to pulse in time with my heartbeat. The dream deepens as definite resolution coalesces — I have to become the conduit, let the city’s needs flow through me, even as the consequences ripple into impossible corners. The weight is crushing, but in the chaos, a fragile order emerges: 

The boats arrive just before the rooftops collapse. The militia turns on the scavengers, allowing the meds to slip through. The desalination plant gets one solar panel to purify the outbreak victim’s water. The fractal map fades as my mentor’s figure dissolves into liquid light, murmuring, “Connections before control.”

I wake gasping. The numbers still swim before my eyes, demanding optimization, but the dream’s logic lingers:  sometimes mercy requires variance from the grid.
