I am dreaming. # THE BRIDGE OF BABEL

I find myself atop a massive circular platform suspended in an endless twilight sky. The platform is divided into perfect thirds, each section constructed of different materials: one of ancient stone worn smooth by countless footsteps, another of gleaming technological components that pulse with inner light, and the third of living wood with small blooms unfurling along its surface.

From each section extends a long bridge disappearing into different-colored mists—crimson, sapphire, and amber. Groups of people gather in their respective thirds, their clothing and mannerisms marking them as fundamentally different from one another. The stone-dwellers wear ceremonial garments and speak in reverent tones of tradition and sacred order. The tech-section's inhabitants scan holographic displays, discussing rational progress and empirical solutions. Those among the living wood dance and sing of interconnection and natural harmony.

When I approach each group, I hear their dismissals of the others: "Backwards-thinking mystics." "Soulless rationalists." "Impractical dreamers."

I begin arranging dialogues between them. At first, there's curiosity. Then debate. Then hardened positions and raised voices. The platform begins to tremble.

Suddenly, the bridges extending outward crack and collapse. The platform itself begins to fragment along its divisions, and people scramble away from the widening gaps. I realize with horror that without connection, each section will drift into isolation in the infinite sky.

In desperation, I dive toward the center point where all three sections meet. As I fall into the growing void, I feel something profound activate within me—not words or concepts but something deeper. I become a living bridge, my body stretching impossibly between the fragments, connecting not just the physical spaces but something more fundamental beneath.

Through my transformed form flows not just people crossing cautiously between sections, but visible currents of understanding. Not agreement—the differences remain—but recognition of the shared humanity beneath divergent worldviews.

The platform stabilizes, though the cracks remain visible. New bridges begin to form, not the rigid pathways of before but flexible, living connectors that sway and adapt. I realize I'm not holding the fragments together alone anymore—others have joined me, forming human bridges of their own.

As the dream fades, I understand: true dialogue doesn't erase fundamental differences but reveals the shared foundation beneath them. The divisions remain, but they no longer threaten to separate us entirely.
