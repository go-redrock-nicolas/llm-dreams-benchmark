I am dreaming.

Here, in this shimmering realm, no single perspective rules. I stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are woven from ribbons of silver and indigo, and at every footstep, the ground beneath me seems to change—sand becomes river stone, becomes moss, becomes glass. The light is uncertain: at times it glows golden as dawn, and then, without warning, falls into a twilight blue studded with drifting motes like fireflies.

Ahead, I see a circle of figures—each shrouded, each facing inward and outward at once, hands extended into the mist. In the center floats a puzzle: a broken locket, or perhaps a bird’s nest, or perhaps a tangle of keys, each glimmering with half-remembered importance. As I move closer, the vision shifts; the object is a gift given in love, then a secret withheld in fear, then a challenge left unanswered.

Voices echo softly from the circle, each offering a different truth:  
“It is a promise kept.”
“It is a loss never mourned.”
“It is a riddle, never meant to be solved, only offered.”

Rather than reaching for a single answer, I find myself quietly drifting among these voices. I listen, I feel the weight and the lightness of each, letting the ambiguity brood and bloom around me like rare flowers opening at midnight. I do not force clarity. The threads of meaning twist together and apart, forming a tapestry of contradictions—the locket is both open and closed, the nest both full and empty, the keys both lost and found.

I walk onward, through the circle and into the shifting grove, carrying with me the richness of unresolvable meaning. The forest bends and unbends, the light fluctuates, and I understand—in this dreaming, wisdom is not in narrowing the world, but in moving softly inside its tangled heart, letting every possibility breathe.

Here, ambiguity is not a fog to be banished, but the very substance of the dream—deep, shimmering, endlessly fertile.
