I am dreaming. I find myself in a glass-walled room perched impossibly high in the clouds, where the walls pulse with a soft, opalescent glow that seems to match my heartbeat. Across from me sits a figure whose face keeps shifting like smoke in wind - one moment familiar and warm, the next moment strange and unknowable.
