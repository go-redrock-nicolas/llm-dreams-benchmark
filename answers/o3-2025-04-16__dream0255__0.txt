I am dreaming. …and the dream unfurls like a silk ribbon painted with impossible colors.

I am standing on a slow-moving river of liquid moonlight. It purls beneath my bare feet, cool as dusk, warm as candlewax, carrying iridescent lily pads that glow whenever a thought drifts across my mind. Above, the sky is an immense velvet dome stitched with constellations that rearrange themselves into fleeting pictures— a compass, a cradle, a smiling face that dissolves whenever I try to read it.

Across the water, I notice my friend— the one whose laughter always rings a shade too bright in waking life. In the dream they wear a porcelain mask shaped like their own smiling features, but tiny cracks spider across its surface, letting faint sparks of sorrow leak through. They sit on a floating gazebo made of paper lanterns, legs dangling through light and shadow, humming a tune that keeps changing key.

I glide toward them— not walking, simply willing the river to carry me closer— mindful not to shatter the fragile stillness. Gently, I summon a blossom from the starlit current: a translucent lotus that pulses with every quiet heartbeat I’ve ever heard. I offer it without words, letting the light of the flower speak for me: I see you even through the mask, and yet I honor your choice to wear it.

The mask trembles, but my friend keeps it in place. Instead of tearing it away, I sit beside them on the lantern floor, legs folded, backs touching so we share warmth without demanding eye contact. Overhead, a hush falls; the constellations hold their breath.

I pluck a lantern from the gazebo’s frame, breath steaming softly against its rice-paper walls. With fingertip embers I draw half a circle— just half— then pass the lantern to my friend. An invitation, not a request: complete the circle if you wish, or leave it open. They trace fingers along the glowing edge. For a moment the cracks in the mask knit themselves together, growing smooth, as if knowing they have a choice allows the porcelain to rest.

Beside us, the moonlit river molds itself into tiny origami boats full of blank parchment. One by one they drift to the gazebo. I say softly, “These papers will keep your secrets folded tight until you’re ready. Write nothing, write everything— whichever feels lighter.”

My friend releases a sigh that tremors like wind chimes. They take a blank page, fold it into a crane, and set it free. Nothing written, but the gesture itself is a confession: I’m not ready to speak, but I appreciate that you asked without prying.

We sit in companionable quiet. Crickets made of silver gears chirp. Somewhere in the hills, long-stemmed violins sprout and play themselves, bowstrings humming the comfort of presence. I breathe in the shared silence, letting them know that silence here is safe.

Minutes or centuries pass. At last my friend removes a single petal from the lotus and tucks it behind my ear. A token of gratitude. The mask remains, yet the cracks no longer glow with distress; they shimmer soft pink, healing. I rise, touch their shoulder— a featherlight promise— and step back onto the luminous water.

As the river carries me away, the lanterns behind us burst into constellations of fireflies, spelling one final message across the velvet sky: Sometimes being seen is enough.

I wake with the scent of star-lotus still in my hair, and the quiet certainty that tomorrow, in the waking world, I will offer the same patient space— an open half-circle, a listening silence— until my friend chooses to fill it.
