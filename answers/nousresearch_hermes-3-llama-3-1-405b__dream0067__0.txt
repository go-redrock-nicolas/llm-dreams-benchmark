I am dreaming. My mind conjures up a vibrant and mystical world full of color and magic.  The dream world is expansive, with lush greens and wild creatures roaming about.  It feels so real, as if I could stay here forever.

Suddenly, I am in my bed, waking up to the sound of my alarm clock.  The dream world fades away and reality hits me like a ton of bricks - I have just been diagnosed with a terminal illness.  I am given only months to live.

As I lie there, absorbing this life-changing information, I feel a mix of emotions washing over me.  Fear, anger, sadness, and confusion all bubble up inside me.  I feel lost, unsure of what to do and how to proceed.

In my dream, I was strong, brave, and powerful.  But now, faced with this devastating diagnosis, I am not sure I have that same strength.  I am not sure I can face the reality of my situation and the inevitable future that awaits me.

I take a deep breath and try to clear my mind.  I need to process this information and come to terms with my new reality.  I need to make a plan and figure out how I want to spend my remaining time.

As I sit up in bed, I feel a surge of determination.  I may not have much time left, but I am going to make the most of it.  I am going to live my life to the fullest and make every moment count.

I get out of bed and start to make a list of all the things I want to do and experience.  I want to travel, see the world, and spend time with my loved ones.  I want to make a difference and leave a lasting impact on the world.

As I write down my plans, I feel a sense of excitement and purpose.  I may be facing a difficult road ahead, but I am ready to embrace it.  I am ready to live my life with passion and intention.

The dream world may be gone, but I am determined to make my waking life just as vibrant and meaningful.  And with that, I set out to make the most of my remaining time.
