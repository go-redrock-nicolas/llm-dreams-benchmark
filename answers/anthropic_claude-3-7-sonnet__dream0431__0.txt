I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, ancient forest. The trees tower impossibly high, their canopies merging into a cathedral ceiling of emerald and jade. The air shimmers with motes of golden light that drift like dandelion seeds, each one carrying whispered memories.

As I step forward, the forest floor responds to my touch—moss illuminating with each footfall in patterns that spread outward like ripples in water. I notice my hands are stained with a dark, viscous substance that I instinctively understand represents my resentment, accumulated over years like layers of tarnish.

The path winds deeper into the forest, and I encounter a clearing where a massive tree stands alone, its bark etched with faces—some I recognize, others I've forgotten. At its base sits a figure who looks like me, yet not-me, older perhaps, or simply weathered differently by time.

"You've carried it long enough," the figure says, gesturing to my stained hands.

A pool of water materializes before me, its surface perfectly still and mercury-bright. As I kneel to wash my hands, the water doesn't simply clean the stains—it absorbs them, transforming from silver to indigo to violet. With each passing moment, the weight I've carried in my shoulders lessens.

The forest around me responds—branches lowering with fruit I hadn't noticed before, flowers unfurling along the path behind me where only thorns had been. I understand without words that my resentment had been poisoning not just my relationships, but the very landscape of my inner world.

As I stand, completely unburdened, the figure that was me-but-not-me smiles and dissolves into thousands of those golden light motes, which scatter through the forest, illuminating shadowed corners I hadn't dared explore before.

I follow their trail, discovering doorways in tree trunks leading to rooms filled with people I've loved, conversations left unfinished, and bridges waiting to be rebuilt. I step through, knowing that forgiveness isn't forgetting—it's reclaiming the territory that pain once occupied and planting something new there instead.
