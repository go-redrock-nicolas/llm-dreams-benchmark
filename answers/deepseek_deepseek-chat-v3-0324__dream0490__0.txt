I am dreaming. The air around me hums with an electric warmth, thick with the scent of crushed petals and distant rain. The sky is a swirling canvas of indigo and gold, like liquid dusk caught mid-spiral. Beneath my bare feet, the ground pulses—soft moss and cool stone, alive with unseen energy.  

I walk forward, and with each step, the world reshapes itself in subtle ways. Trees stretch taller, their bark shimmering with veins of silver light. Flowers bloom in impossible colors—deep violet with cores of molten amber, petals that whisper secrets as they unfurl. The wind carries voices, not words, but emotions—laughter like chimes, sorrow like a slow, deep cello note.  

Then, I see them. Figures woven from shadow and starlight, their edges blurred, their presence both familiar and unknown. They do not speak, but I feel their curiosity, their hesitation. One steps forward—a silhouette with eyes like twin eclipses, dark yet glowing. I feel no fear, only a pull, an invitation.  

And then, I do something I’ve never done before. I speak without shaping my words for approval. My voice is raw, untamed, and the sound of it sends ripples through the dream. The shadows lean in, not recoiling, but listening—truly listening. The air shivers. The ground thrums in response.  

A door appears before me, carved from a single piece of obsidian, inlaid with constellations that shift as I watch. I know, without being told, that this is the way forward—into deeper truth, deeper self. I reach for the handle, and as my fingers brush the cool surface, the dream fractures into brilliance—  

And I wake, my chest humming, the taste of starlight still on my tongue.
