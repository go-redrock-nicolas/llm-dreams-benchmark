I am dreaming. …find myself standing on the shore of a midnight-blue sea whose waves roll in complete silence. Above me, the sky is ink-black—yet it pulses with veins of copper light, as though illuminated from within. Every few heartbeats, a hush falls over the cosmos, and the constellations rearrange themselves into a single, repeating shape: an intricate key of twisting vines and fractured starlight.

I recognize it at once. That key has followed me through countless nights—glimmering on murals beneath collapsing ruins, drawn in frost upon forgotten mirrors, glowing on the irises of strangers whose names vanish when I wake. I know, with dream-logic clarity, that it carries a question I have failed to answer.

The tide recedes. Left behind is a staircase sculpted from sea-salt, descending where water once was. Its steps glow faintly, humming in unison with the star-key above. Pulled by curiosity—and by the familiar tug of destiny that dreams specialize in—I take the first step downward.

As I descend, the salt-steps transform under my feet, each one shifting into scenes of half-remembered moments:

Step one: A classroom window. I am six, staring at rainfall that looks like strands of silver thread. My forgotten childhood wish to “find the door in the rain” flickers in the glass.

Step two: A hospital hallway. I am older, clutching a bouquet of wilting marigolds. A clock overhead ticks in reverse, reminding me of time I lost when my grandfather slipped away while I hesitated outside.

Step three: A library with no roof. Books hover like migrating birds, their pages fluttering open to blank white. They await a story—the story I never dared to write.

With each memory, the silent waves high above change color: silver at the first step, golden at the second, crimson at the third. Only when I reach the salt floor do I realize the waves have frozen mid-curl, arresting in a sculpture of time paused.

At the salt floor lies a door made of semi-transparent glass. Behind it, shadowy figures pace: not monsters, but possibilities—versions of myself turned opaque by regret. Each holds the star-key in their hands, but theirs are fractured, incomplete, missing a tooth or twisted at the bow. I feel the weight of choices deferred and detours taken.

I raise my gaze again to the sky, and the full star-key hovers before me, ready to descend. I must decide: do I shatter the glass door and confront the shadow-selves who whisper of mistakes, or do I walk back up, ignoring the dream’s insistent call?

Instinct—or perhaps truth—guides me. I extend my hands. The star-key melts into soft, warm light, pouring through my fingers like liquid dawn. It re-forms as a single word etched across my palms: Begin.

Understanding blooms. The recurring key was never permission to unlock a door somewhere else; it was the beckoning to unlock my own inertia. Begin: write the words, speak the apology, step into the unfamiliar. The dream does not want me to open an external gate—it wants me to open the stalled chapters of my waking life.

I press my illuminated palms to the glass. No shattering, no violence. The door dissolves into mist, and the shadow-selves merge back into me. Their faces soften with relief, as if they too desired wholeness. The salt stairs reverse, rising back toward the now-still waves. Each step I climb, those blank books overhead fill with ink—pages etching themselves with stories I have yet to live.

At the crest of the staircase, dawn finally breaks. The copper veins in the sky erupt into vibrant rose-gold, and the silent waves resume their song in a harmonious hush. The sea whispers a final echo: “Begin.”

I inhale the luminous air, ready—and wake with salt on my lips, a heartbeat humming like the key’s gentle glow, and an unshakable certainty that the dream’s message is clear: the first step is always to start.
