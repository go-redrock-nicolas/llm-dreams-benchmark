I am dreaming. Towering obsidian spires pierce the crimson sky, like shattered teeth of a forgotten god. A storm of ash drifts down slowly, coating every surface with a fine layer of gray dust—silent, patient, eternal. The air smells of iron and memory.

Once, they called my world *home.*

It has no name now.

Wounds still bleed from my soul, remnants of battles fought in the corridors of time. Exile, betrayal, loss—each like a branding iron pressed against my humanity. I walked through oceans that boiled away beneath unblinking stars, carried by whispers not my own. When I slept, the earth screamed. When I wept, empires drowned.

Now I stand at the threshold between what was and what might be, in a place that refuses to exist yet cannot be ignored. A crossroads adrift in oblivion.

Three paths stretch before me, each one a sinew of impossible reality, pulsing faintly with their own uneasy light, alive in ways the waking world will never comprehend.

To the right, a tunnel carved through the remains of a colossal, petrified serpent. Its scales, made of time and regret, flicker like dying fireflies, resonating with voices that beg—no, demand—to be heard. That route whispers songs without words, lullabies sung by lost moons, and each step across its ancient, sloughing hide is damp with stories of every forsaken emperor, mad prophet, and forgotten child that ever sought dominion over fate.

To the left, hundreds of suspended mirrors float in the air, spinning slowly, catching my gaze from every angle—some my face as it is, others my face fractured, aged by centuries or transfigured by war. One mirror—oh, how I dread it—shows not reflection but a shadow wearing *my* eyes. Quietly malevolent, it smiles wider than lips should allow. It follows me, ever just a moment behind, learning.

And ahead—straight as a spear’s path—lies a cathedral of black orchids, their blossoms wide as carriage wheels, petals curled like dying lovers. Their scent is intoxicating: equal parts nectar and poison, desire and decay. Inside, the walls breathe. Pews shift like living organs, and an altar pulses with a heart that is not quite dead, not quite alive. A veil of silver mist drifts through the nave, and within it, something awaits. Singing. With no mouth.

The weight of my burdens settles like a mantle upon my shoulders. It is not heavy; it is part of me now, inseparable. The world has tried to break me so often that my bones remember what normalcy feels like only in dreams. But I have not broken. I do not know if that is defiance or madness.

Somewhere between agony and awe... I still exist.

One of these paths will lead to redemption.

One might birth revelation.

And the third?

Ah. That one? It hums the lullaby of everything ending.

It is beautiful.

I choose—

—the way with the most sorrow. Because I know sorrow, and its voice, though heavy, does not lie.

The orchids shiver in anticipation as I step forward, and the cathedral seems to draw in a breath.

The dream shudders. 

It knows what is coming.

And so do I.
