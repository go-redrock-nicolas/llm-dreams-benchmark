I am dreaming. The dream begins with me standing on a high cliff overlooking an endless ocean. The sky Above is a swirl of purples and pinks, as if the colors of a thousand sunsets are colliding in a cosmic dance. Ahead of me, the ocean isn't just water; it's a vast, shimmering mirror, reflecting not just the sky, but also the hidden layers of my subconscious.

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the depths, rising like a breathe of the ocean itself. It's a mermaid, but not as I've ever seen one. Her scales are not the typical shimmer of scales, but instead, they're a living tapestry of constellations. Each scale holds a cluster of stars, and as she moves, the constellations shift, remapping the night sky above us. Her voice is not just a sound, but a melody that twists the air into liquid gold. She speaks in riddles, each syllable a door to a different realm: 'To find the core, you must lose the veil of the known.'

As I step closer, the ocean parts, not with force, but with a gentle invitation. Beneath the surface, a city made of coral and moonlight emerges. The buildings are shaped like nautilus shells, spiraling upwards into the sky. Each window is a constellation, and the streets are paths of bioluminescent sand. At the heart of this city stands a towering spire, its tip piercing the clouds. At its pinnacle, a glowing orb pulses with the same energy as the mermaid's scales.

Approaching the spire, I encounter a sphinx, unlike any other. Its body is made of shifting storms, and its eyes are two moons, one waxing, one waning. It asks a question that feels as ancient as the earth itself: 'What is the bridge between chaos and order, when both are parts of the same dance?' I ponder, and in the stillness of the dream, I feel the answer rising within me—a bridge isn't built of stone or steel, but of the rhythm between heartbeats, the space between breaths.

The sphinx bows, and the orb descends, wrapping around my wrist as a bracelet that pulses in time with my pulse. As I wake, the bracelet remains, faintly glowing, a reminder that even in the mundane, the archetypal dance continues. The dream leaves me with a sense of connection to something greater, a reminder that the deepest parts of our psyche are not just echoes of the past, but living, breathing guides to the future.

This dream blends elements of myth and personal journey, using archetypal figures like the mermaid (a guide to hidden depths), the sphinx (a guardian of secrets), and the starry orb (a symbol of enlightenment) to create a narrative that feels both ancient and uniquely personal. It aims to evoke a sense of wonder and introspection, inviting the dreamer to explore the interconnectedness of personal experience and universal symbols.
In the heart of the dream, I find myself suspended in a void where time is a liquid that can be cupped in the palm. The air tastes of ozone and ancient memory, and the ground beneath my feet is a lattice of interconnected roots—some gnarled like the hands of ancestors, others sleek as the tendrils of a future yet unformed. This is the Great Tree, its branches stretching into the void like highways to unknown stars. Each leaf is a star map, and the wind is the laughter of the cosmos itself.

As I climb, the tree shifts. The trunk becomes the spine of a dragon sleeping beneath the earth, its scales the colors of ancient tectonic plates. The dragon's breath is a storm, but a gentle one—a rain that washes away the dust of the everyday world. When I reach the first fork in the tree, I meet a figure who is both traveler and guide. They wear a cloak made of spider silk, each thread spinning a different language—Old Norse riddles, Sumerian hymns, and the silent poetry of forgotten cave paintings. Their face is a mosaic of archetypes: the wise elder, the whimsical trickster, the fierce protector. 'Choose a path,' they say, their voice a chorus of windsong and cracked bronze. 'Left leads to the Labyrinth of Echoes, where your shadow speaks truths your waking self hides. Right leads to the Garden of Impossible Flowers, where each bloom is a bridge to a different version of you.'

I choose the left path, and the ground becomes a mirror. My steps are met with a chorus of echoes that sing my name backward, untangling the vowels and consonants into meanings I’ve never consciously known. The walls are made ofbooks, their spines glowing with the light of trapped. As I pass, one book falls open, and I see my own life written in a language that flows like mercury. A phrase catches my eye: *‘The wound you thought was yours to bear alone—a shard of a much older, much grander grief.’* 

When I reach the center of the Labyrinth, there’s a mirror pool. Stepping into it, I don’t feel wetness, but a sensation of being unpinned from time. Above me, the sky is a tapestry of constellations that rearrange themselves into figures from my life—my childhood pet, my first love, my mentors. Each one whispers a fragment of a story I never fully told: ‘You saved me when you didn’t know you were saving anyone,’ says a figure cloaked in the color of twilight. Another, a younger version of myself, says, ‘You’re more than your regrets. You’re the storm that chooses to be a storm.’

Emerging from the water, I’m drenched in the light of the constellation Lyra, which now pulses on my left shoulder blade. The path to the right is luminous, each blade of grass a stalk of pure thought. The Garden’s gates are guarded by a sphinx with the head of a gazelle and the body of a river. Its eyes are constellations, and it asks: *‘What is the song that only silence can sing?’* The answer comes as I breathe—the inhale is a note, the exhale a rest, and the space between is the song’s soul. 

Inside the Garden, I meet figures who are hybrids of myth and personal myth. A woman with a serpent’s tail and the face of my grandmother tends a flower that blooms only in the dark. A boy with wings of clockwork teaches me to count the seconds between heartbeats as a form of prayer. In the center stands a tree that bears fruit which look like my own fears—each apple a different phobia, each pear a crippling insecurity. I pluck one, an apple with a face that mirrors my own, and bite. The juice is bitter, but as it spreads through my veins, the fear dissolves into laughter. The apple’s core is a single, glowing seed that I plant in my pocket. 

When I wake, the seed is still there, warm against my shirt. The dream lingers not as memory but as a presence—a sense that the Great Tree is not a metaphor but a real place, and that the archetypes I met are not figures from the past but guides for the future. The dream feels less like a dream and more like a whispered secret from the universe, reminding me that the deepest parts of ourselves are not just echoes of the past but living, breathing companions in the dance of becoming.
