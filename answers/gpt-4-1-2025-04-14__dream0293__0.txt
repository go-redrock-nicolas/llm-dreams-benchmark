I am dreaming. …I am standing at the edge of a vast, crystalline lake, but the sky above churns with heavy bruise-purple clouds, threatening rain. The breeze hums with memories—echoes of laughter that curdle into jeers, regretful words that twist like thorns in my chest. Here, in this surreal space, the world feels suspended, alive with possibility and dread.

This is the place where I once faltered: the bridge arching over the lake, slats slippery and uneven. In waking life, I remembered only the splintering sound beneath my foot and the plunge into icy water below—the embarrassment, the rising panic, everyone’s eyes on me. The shame sealed itself into my bones.

Now, as I stare at the bridge, the dreamworld begins to shift. The wood glimmers faintly, as if promising strength, and the wind carries the faint scents of moss and rain rather than fear. I am not alone; reflections of my past selves—uncertain, trembling, younger—stand around me, watching with wide eyes.

Drawing on the ragged lessons that failure has stitched into my heart, I close my eyes and inhale, gathering the scattered fragments of my resolve. My failures coalesce into stepping stones: each misstep, each bruise, forging a new plank for the path before me. When I take that first step, the bridge hums underfoot—not with rotting decay, but with the pulse of living wood. My balance is shaky, but I keep moving, each stride steadier than the last.

Surrounded by spectral doubts and whispered echoes, I allow them to fade into mist. The sky above brightens, blush-pink light breaking through the clouds. My confidence blooms, not from the absence of fear, but from acceptance: wounds may smart, but they do not define me.

At the far end of the bridge, my reflection meets me—whole and unafraid, with a gentle nod. The lake shimmers, calm and welcoming. And as I step onto solid ground, petals of light rain softly around me, laughter (my own, finally joyful) rising, echoing—proving that every shattered attempt forms the mosaic of courage on which I now stand.
