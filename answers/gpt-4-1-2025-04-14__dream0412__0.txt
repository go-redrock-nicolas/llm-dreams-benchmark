I am dreaming.

The rhythm of rain on the windowsill creates a gentle percussive lullaby as I hunch over my desk in a vast, shifting room. The lamp’s golden glow flickers uncertainly, throwing nervous shadows that dance across mounds of papers and half-open books. I am trying to write—letters and numbers, grand schemes and tiny details. Each word should flow smoothly, but I feel them slipping away, scattered like petals on a stream.

As I focus on the document before me, words lose their shapes. Sentences liquefy and curl around my thoughts, teasing me with the urgency of unfinished business. Before long, my attention cracks open, and a flush of stray ideas floods in. The wall behind my desk dissolves into a rolling meadow: sunflowers beckon, sky whales spiral lazily overhead, and a wild, lilac-sweet wind carries the delicate tinkling of unseen bells. I am tempted to tumble, barefoot and laughing, into the tall, fragrant grass.

But I remember my fading ambition—bits of work abandoned on the tides of distraction. With effort, I dig my heels into the daydream, planting roots deep in the soft loam of my intent. I call upon the elements of this dreamscape—a cool autumn breeze to sharpen my senses, beams of dappled light to illuminate clarity, and the steadfast presence of a towering oak, ancient and wise.

I imagine myself sitting at the base of this oak, its roots entwined with my own sense of purpose. With every breath, distractions flutter past—colorful, enticing, but harmlessly drifting away like dandelion seeds on the wind. My focus gathers in a pool at my center, glassy and still. As I lean forward, the work before me comes into focus, crystalline and inviting. My pen moves—words return, decisive and bright, as if sewn together with threads of silver moonlight.

Each time my mind threatens to stray, I find the oak’s deep heartbeat echoing through the dream, reminding me to settle and begin again, anchoring me to the task until the dawn’s gentle light signals the end of the struggle. I wake with the aftertaste of clarity and the intoxicating scent of imaginary meadows, ready to begin anew.
