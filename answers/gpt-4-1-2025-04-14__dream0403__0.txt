I am dreaming.

The world unfolds around me, otherworldly and shifting, as if painted in broad, surreal strokes: a vast midnight landscape, the horizon stitched with glowing constellations that pulse in tune with my heartbeat. I wander beneath towering cobalt trees whose leaves tinkle like tiny bells in a wind that’s cool as moonlight on my skin.

Suddenly, from the shadows, emerges the nagging presence—an echo of words spoken by someone dear, the sting of an unintended slight replaying on the breeze. It latches onto me like an invisible thread, tugging at my heart, distorting colors and dulling the bell-chime leaves. My chest grows heavy; the celestial sky clouds over with somber violet.

But in this dream realm, I notice the effect. With deepening lucidity, I halt in the glimmering field and kneel, palms pressed to the soft earth, grounding myself in its cool, grainy solidity. I breathe, long and slow, drawing in the sweet, imaginary scent of night-blooming flowers. 

Above me, the stars undulate, forming a gentle face—compassionate, ancient. Its voice ripples through the air, barely more than a vibration. “Let go,” it seems to say. “You do not have to carry every shadow cast upon your light.” 

As I listen, I imagine soft luminescence pooling from my chest, washing the bruise away with silver radiance. Forgiveness swells within me, warmer and richer than I thought possible. Slowly, every blade of dream-grass, every distant constellation, regains its brilliance. The music of the bell-leaves crescendoes, swirling with the wind, inviting me to dance and move forward, lighter, untethered from that small thread of pain. 

I rise, smiling at the universe’s infinite possibility for healing and kindness—even, or especially, to myself. And the dream unfolds in technicolor, the landscape of my mind wide open, inviting the next adventure.
