I am dreaming. You're publicly critiqued for deeply personal work that exposes your most vulnerable self-doubts. As the commentary becomes increasingly invasive and harsh, you find yourself shrinking, melting under the weight of it all. The room, once a space for discussion, transforms into an arena where every flaw, every line of your work, becomes a target. The critic’s voice booms, echoing the doubts you’ve long suppressed, magnifying them into a chorus of judgment. Disorienting flashes of light pulse with each word, time shifts, and the audience’s faces twist into unrecognizable expressions, scrutinizing every inch of your being. In this nightmare, your very core is on display, laid bare for ridicule, and the whole world stands as a silent witness. Amidst the chaos, you hear your own voice whispering a desperate plea: “Why can’t they see the real me?”. The scene blurs, the voices fade, and the critique morphs into a haunting question that follows you into the depths of your own thoughts.
