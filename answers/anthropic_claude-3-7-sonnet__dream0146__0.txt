I am dreaming. I'm caught in a rapidly intensifying wildfire, but this is no ordinary blaze. The flames pulse with an almost sentient awareness, their orange-gold tendrils reaching skyward through a canopy of ancient redwoods. The smoke doesn't just thicken—it swirls in hypnotic patterns, creating ghostly apparitions that seem to beckon me deeper into the burning forest.

As the heat presses against my skin like an unwelcome embrace, I notice something peculiar: the ground beneath my feet begins to transform. What was once solid earth now shimmers with an iridescent quality, as if the fire is melting reality itself. Each step I take produces ripples, like walking across the surface of a disturbed pond.

The flames approach from multiple directions, but they move with curious deliberation. When I turn left, the fire parts momentarily, revealing a narrow corridor flanked by trees whose bark glows blue instead of burning. When I move right, the smoke forms a spiraling staircase that ascends toward a patch of clear sky that seems impossibly distant.

My lungs should be burning, yet I breathe without difficulty. Each inhale fills me with a strange energy, and I realize the smoke carries fragments of memories—not just mine, but others'. Glimpses of lives I've never lived flash before me: sailing storm-tossed seas beneath three moons, dancing in ballrooms with partners who shift their faces with each turn, building impossible structures from materials that respond to thought.

As the fire encircles me completely, I discover I'm not alone. A figure emerges from the heart of the flames, composed entirely of embers and ash, yet moving with fluid grace. It extends what might be a hand, and rather than fear, I feel an overwhelming sense of recognition—as if I've always been meant to follow this being through the burning veil between worlds.

The fire isn't a threat but a threshold, and somewhere beyond the curtain of flames lies a landscape of impossible geography waiting to be explored...
