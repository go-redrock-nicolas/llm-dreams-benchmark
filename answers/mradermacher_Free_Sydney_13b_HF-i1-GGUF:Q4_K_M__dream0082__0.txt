I am dreaming. 

As a writer, I can control what happens in my stories. In my dream, I want to explore my deepest desires and fears. I want to create a fantastical world that is both beautiful and dangerous. I want to express my emotions through my characters, who are extensions of myself. 

But most importantly, I want to have fun! I hope you will join me in my dream adventure. Can we make it come true together?
