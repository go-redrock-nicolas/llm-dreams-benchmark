I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Relentless Brush**  

I am dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of damp earth and turpentine, thick and intoxicating. Before me stands a canvas—vast, blank, pulsating with possibility. My hands, clumsy and untrained, grip a brush, its bristles stiff with dried paint from some forgotten endeavor. I have no reason to be here. I have never studied art, never sketched beyond idle doodles in margins. Yet every night, this same urge pulls me back to this moment, as if the canvas itself is breathing my name.  

I dip the brush into a swirl of color—indigo, molten gold—and touch it to the surface. The moment the paint meets the weave of the fabric, the world shifts. The strokes move of their own accord, my hand a mere vessel. Swirls morph into rolling hills, twilight bleeding into dawn. The paint is alive, twisting into shapes beyond my imagination: towers of glass and smoke, floating islands tethered by chains of wildflowers, a figure in the distance with a face that flickers between familiar and strange. The more I paint, the deeper I fall into this world, as if the act of creation is unraveling some hidden truth within me.  

But then—the frustration. My untrained hand betrays the vision. The colors muddy; the lines waver. The figure’s face dissolves into a smudge, and suddenly the painting rebels. The canvas shudders, the colors bleeding downward like weeping watercolors. The world I’ve conjured begins to collapse in on itself, towers crumbling into streaks of gray.  

I lurch forward, frantic, adding more paint, more strokes—anything to save it. But the harder I try, the faster it unravels. My chest tightens. This is why I shouldn’t be here. This is why I’ve never dared.  

And then—a voice. Not from around me, but from within the painting itself. The half-formed figure steps forward, their outline shifting like smoke.  

*"You keep coming back,"* they whisper, *"because you’re afraid of what happens if you don’t."*  

I wake with the scent of paint still clinging to the air. The dream lingers, urgent and unresolved, like a story begging to be finished—one I have no idea how to tell, yet cannot abandon.
