I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the threshold of an imposing Victorian mansion, its weathered facade looming against a twilight sky where impossible constellations swirl in patterns that seem almost mathematical. My hand trembles as I reach for the brass doorknob, knowing that beyond lies a gathering of shadowy figures whose faces I cannot quite recall, though they all claim to know me intimately.

The door swings open without my touch, revealing a grand ballroom where chandeliers float untethered to any ceiling, their crystals catching light from sources I cannot identify. The guests turn to me in perfect synchronicity, their features constantly shifting like liquid portraits—one moment sharp and defined, the next blurred like watercolors in rain.

Music emanates not from instruments but from the very walls, which pulse with vibrant colors that correspond to each haunting note. I recognize the melody as something I've never heard before yet somehow have always known. My feet begin moving across the marble floor, which ripples like water beneath my steps, creating concentric circles that spread to the room's edges.

As I navigate through the crowd, conversations fade in and out like radio signals—profound secrets and mundane observations blending together into a symphony of half-understood wisdom. Every person I pass offers me an object: a tarnished key, a book with blank pages that fill with text as I glance at them, a photograph of a place I've never been but desperately miss.

Above, through windows that weren't there moments ago, I see two moons racing each other across the night sky, leaving trails of stardust that form intricate patterns reminiscent of ancient script. I somehow understand this is a message meant exclusively for me, though its meaning remains tantalizingly just beyond comprehension.

The dream pulses with both dread and wonder, as if the universe itself is breathing through this imagined space, revealing glimpses of truths too vast for waking consciousness to contain.
