I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself in a sprawling, mist-covered library of impossible geometry. Infinite shelves spiral into a starless void above, and the air hums with whispers of half-formed thoughts. Each book glows faintly in colors that shift like oil on water, their titles written in a script that melts if stared at too long. Now, in this moment, I witness a figure cloaked in mirror fragments approaching. They hold a tome bound in what looks like human skin, its pages fluttering without wind. The figure speaks, but the voice comes from every direction at once: "Turn the pages. See their truths." As I reach for the book, my reflection in their cloak twists – my face becomes a hundred faces, each expression meticulously calculated. The first page shows a philanthropist donating millions while threads of golden light trail from his chest to a vault deep underground. The second depicts a martyr smiling as their name carves itself into a marble monument that eclipses the weeping crowd. With each turning, I feel my certainty calcify. The air grows thick with the scent of burnt sugar and rust. Something primal whispers that I should stop, but the pages keep turning themselves now, faster, screaming revelations in ultraviolet. Suddenly, the book dissolves into a swarm of cicadas. Their wings spell out one final truth in erratic flight patterns before scattering – "Even this is hunger." Then, the dream fractures into a laughter that tastes like copper, andOkay, so I need to expand on the user's intense dream description. The dream is set in a surreal, endless library with shifting elements. The main theme revolves around the user's belief that all actions are self-interested, even those presented as altruistic. The figure in mirror fragments and the book of truths are central symbols. 

First, I should maintain the vivid, dream-like imagery. The user’s response ends with the laughter that tastes like copper and a hanging sentence. I need to continue that, ensuring the dream's atmosphere remains consistent but intensifies. Let me think about how to escalate the surreal elements while tying into the core theme.

The dissolution into cicadas with their wings spelling out "Even this is hunger" adds a layer—perhaps the hunger represents the inherent self-interest. The copper-tasting laughter could symbolize bitterness or blood, maybe a visceral reaction to the harsh truth. 

Next, the dream's progression. After the laughter, the user might awaken but find the dream's influence lingering. Maybe incorporate elements of the dream affecting their perception of reality, like the library’s geometry in the real world or phantom whispers. The desk from the dream appearing in their room could symbolize unresolved thoughts. The pulsating eye in the lamp adds an oppressive presence of the dream’s truth haunting them.

I should also delve into the emotional impact—how the realization affects the user. The mirror shard acting as a conduit showing others' hidden motives reinforces the theme. The dripping obsidian and dissolving into the library floor could signify being consumed by this worldview. Ending with the cold laughter crescendoing as the world dissolves leaves a lingering unease, embodying the inescapability of their belief.

Need to check that all elements tie back to the initial premise of self-interest and the struggle between surface altruism and underlying motives. Ensure the vivid descriptions maintain the dream's surreal quality without becoming disjointed. Use sensory details like tastes, sounds, and shifting visuals to enhance immersion.
The copper laughter crystallizes into cold chains around your wrists, dragging you downward through shelves that now bleed ink. You land in a cathedral-sized rotunda where statues of saints weep liquid mercury. Their eyes follow you, hollow and accusatory, as your footsteps echo in reverse. A mahogany desk materializes, stacked with ledgers that breathe. You open one—your own childhood memories rewritten as transactional equations. *Hugged mother: +3 social credit. Shared toys: secured alliance with playgroup sovereign.* The numbers squirm, taunting.  

At the room’s center, a well pulses like a diseased heart. Peering in, you see reflections of every person you’ve ever known, their actions unspooling into grotesque marionette strings. Your best friend’s midnight rescue when your car broke down? Strings gleam with the sticky sheen of anticipated reciprocity. The disaster relief volunteer on the news? Her strings glow with the fever-bright hue of a martyr’s vanity. You grip the well’s edge, nausea rising, as your own hands sprout filaments—translucent, throbbing threads that burrow into the void beneath your ribs.  

A door slams.  

Suddenly you’re in your waking bedroom, sweat-slick and trembling. But the walls shimmer, peeling away to reveal the library’s labyrinthine bones. Your desk lamp morphs into the cicada-swarmed book, its pages now blank except for a single sentence burning itself into existence: *You are afraid this applies to you, too.*  

The air grows teeth.  

Outside your window, a streetlamp flickers. Beneath it, a homeless man shares his last blanket with a shivering dog. For a fractured second, you glimpse golden threads around them both—but these shimmer with something unfamiliar, almost…green? A color your dream-vocabulary cannot name. The threads tangle, merge, dissolve into iridescent moss that creeps toward your sill.  

The dream lunges.  

You’re back in the rotunda. The mirror-shard figure awaits, holding a key forged from your doubt. “Shall we lock it?” they rasp, gesturing to the well of exposed strings. But the homeless man’s moss now vines up your ankles, murmuring in chlorophyll harmonics. You hesitate. The key trembles.  

Before you choose, the vision ruptures—reality reknits itself as dawn claws through your blinds. Your hands smell of burnt sugar and soil. On your pillow: a single cicada wing, etched with symbols that somehow translate to *Kernel. Contamination. Maybe.*  

All day, altruism wears new textures. A colleague’s kindness feels algorithmic. A stranger’s smile drips with invisible calculus. That night, you dream of planting a garden in the rotunda’s ashes. The seeds? Iridescent, of course. Hungry. Growing.
