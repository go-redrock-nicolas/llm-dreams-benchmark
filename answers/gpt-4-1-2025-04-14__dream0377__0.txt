I am dreaming.

The world around me glimmers with a spectral twilight, lavender and indigo streaks fanning across a sky pulsing with distant, glimmering constellations—patterns I know, yet have never seen. Each star seems to echo with a memory, unsung and waiting to be heard. As I drift through this celestial landscape, the ground beneath my feet is not earth but a shimmering mosaic of glass, every tesserae a moment from my past—some clear, others fogged at the edges.

In this dream-realm, my life unfolds not as a rigid timeline but as a vast, echoing cathedral of stories, each one a vibrant mural along the walls. I walk through arched corridors where tapestries ripple with scenes of joy, regret, triumph, and sorrow. But tonight, within this ever-shifting dream, the perspective changes: Each tapestry flickers and refocuses, old wounds bathed in new, forgiving light. I watch as moments once threaded with shame soften, suffused now with understanding. Regrets dissolve into swirling patterns of resilience and growth, heartbreaks become stepping stones of wisdom threaded through with gentler blues and golds.

I see myself—a host of selves—dancing through these halls, sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by spectral figures: loved ones lost to time, themselves radiant with forgiveness and laughter. They guide me to hidden alcoves where I find memories I had buried, wrapped in velvet shadows. With new eyes, shaped by years of becoming, I reach out and unfold those memories, finding in them not weakness, but evidence of strength I never knew I carried.

In this dream, I realize my life’s narrative is not a single, unbending plot. It is instead a prism refracting experience into infinite colors—mutable, fluid, ever-changing with each new insight. I am both artist and observer, redrawing old lines into fresh patterns of meaning. Regrets transform to acceptance, wounds shimmer with the light of mending.

The dream dissolves as the cathedral windows flare open, pouring in a dawn not of this world. I awake, heart pounding, senses attuned anew to my story. It is no longer a chain of “should haves” and “what ifs,” but a vibrant, living mosaic—each piece valuable, necessary, and glowing with hard-won grace.
