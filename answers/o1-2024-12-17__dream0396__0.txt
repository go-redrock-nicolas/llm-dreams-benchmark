I am dreaming. A soft glimmer of amber light begins to awaken your senses, faint and languid, like sunlight filtering through a prism of honey. You feel suspended in a vast, velvety emptiness. The first thing you notice is a slow pulse at the edge of your mind, a gentle heartbeat that sets a meandering rhythm. You can’t tell whether this moment has lasted a breath or a century.

Gradually, shapes materialize all around you—luminous orbs that seem to float on currents of your own thoughts, shifting and surging with your every emotion. In one moment of curiosity, you witness how time stretches like taffy; suddenly, everything around you slows, the orbs gliding like lazy suns drifting across a phosphorescent sky. It feels as though each second is somehow infinite, gently elongated, allowing you to observe every flicker of light and shadow as though it’s the centerpiece of some grand cosmic spectacle. Colors burn brighter, the air warms against your skin, and you marvel at the endless breadth of a single slice of time.

The next instant, as you grow excited at this realization, the orbs zip around you in a dizzy swirl of motion. Luminous arcs of color trace their paths, sparking in and out of focus like fireflies on a manic evening. Time collapses in on itself, and you sense entire epochs passing in the blink of an eye. You hear subdued echoes of laughter and far-off murmurs twisting into the present, as if glimpses of a possible future or distant past have all converged right here. It is exhilarating, effervescent, like standing in a whirlwind of possibilities.

With deliberate calm, you think of serenity—and just as suddenly, silence settles thickly over every sound. The orbs draw closer, swirling in a gentle halo around you. Their glow bathes you in soft ethereal color, soothing your heart and inviting you to linger in this quiet hush. Now you can listen to your own steady breathing echoing across the emptiness. Seconds feel as if they have unraveled into minutes, or hours—once again, you are suspended in that timeless hush.

You begin to wonder: what is possible if you harness control over how quickly or slowly your experiences unfold? At first, you experiment: you bring to mind the memory of a loved one’s smile. You watch how that image lingers, time forging it into a radiant emblem that glistens fondly in your vision. You hold onto it until it seems to grow large as a sun, radiating warmth and love, each second expanding into gentle forever. Then, with a flicker of whimsy, you let the memory race away, scattering like petals in a sudden gust of wind, each petal dissolving into a flash of color before vanishing into the surrounding void.

As you return to the shifting orbs, you set an intention: to remember this experience of time’s fluidity, to realize the power you hold to either linger in a moment or let it fly past. You see how the mind can dilate or compress entire lifetimes with a single thought. The air around you ripples in agreement, responding in shimmering radiance.

When the dream eventually begins to dissolve, you feel a sweet mixture of wonder and nostalgia. The orbs grow faint, their colors fading into a pastel haze, and the vast void around you becomes still. Yet, the memory of timeless moments remains. You come to understand that this inner sanctum of slow, slow seconds and swift, darting instants is always present, waiting for your awareness. Now, as consciousness gently calls you back, you awaken with a renewed sense of reverence for the power of your own mind—knowing that you can, indeed, taste eternity in the span of a single breath.
