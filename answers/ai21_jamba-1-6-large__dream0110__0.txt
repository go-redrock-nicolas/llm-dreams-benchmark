I am dreaming. 

I am dreaming of a world where I don't have to work. 

In this dream, I am not bound by the constraints of a 9-to-5 job. 

I am free to do what I want, when I want. 

I can travel to far-off lands, experience new cultures, and meet new people. 

Or, if I prefer, I can stay at home, relax and enjoy my time. 

I don't have to worry about bills or rent or any of the other financial burdens that weigh me down. 

I have all the money I need to live comfortably and pursue my passions. 

In this dream, I am truly happy. I am free. 

But then I wake up. 

And reality sets in. 

The dream is gone, and I am back to my mundane life of work and bills and responsibilities. 

But still, I hold onto that dream. It keeps me going. 

Because someday, I know I will make it come true. 

Someday, I will be free.
