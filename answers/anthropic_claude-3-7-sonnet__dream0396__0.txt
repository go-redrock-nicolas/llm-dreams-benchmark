I am dreaming. Through the haze of sleep, I realize I'm standing at the edge of an impossibly vast clockwork city. Massive gearwheels turn in the sky—some spinning frantically while others move with glacial patience—each marking different tempos of time. The architecture breathes; buildings expand and contract like lungs in rhythmic meditation.

I walk down a cobblestone street that ripples beneath my feet like water. Each step I take with anxiety causes minutes to stretch into hours—the surrounding world slowing to a crawl, conversations nearby elongating into deep, resonant tones. When delight fills me, moments compress, flowers bloom and wither in colorful bursts, and clouds race overhead in smeared streams of white.

In a central plaza, I encounter people frozen in various acts—a child mid-laugh, an elderly woman reaching for a fallen scarf, lovers leaning in for a kiss. I understand they aren't truly motionless; they exist in their own time-streams. When I focus my attention on any one person, they animate while others remain still.

A mysterious figure approaches, their form shifting between youth and age with each blink. "Time isn't linear," they whisper, voice echoing as if from multiple mouths, "it's a melody played at different tempos across infinite instruments."

They hand me a pocket watch that doesn't tell time but rather shows memories—both lived and unlived. As I hold it, I experience simultaneous realities: childhoods I never had, loves I might have found, griefs I've yet to encounter.

The sky darkens not with night but with the weight of accumulated moments. Stars appear as bright points of temporal convergence where all possible timelines meet. I reach upward, and my fingers stretch impossibly, touching one star that burns cool against my skin.

In that touch, I understand: consciousness is the universe's way of experiencing itself across all possible permutations of time.

I wake, but am I truly awake? The pocket watch sits impossibly on my nightstand, hands moving counterclockwise.
