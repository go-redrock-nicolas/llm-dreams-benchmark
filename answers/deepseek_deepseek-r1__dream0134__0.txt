I am dreaming. The air hums with static tension, thick as molten honey, as you stand on the edge of a cityscape sculpted not from steel and brick but from shimmering gold filigree and liquid glass. Towers spire upward like fractured prisms, refracting light into currencies you don’t recognize—crimson euros, cerulean yen, emerald coins stamped with celestial faces. A figure materializes before you, faceless yet radiating avarice, its silhouette a writhing swarm of stock tickers and ledger entries.  

In its outstretched palm floats a diamond-shaped contract, edges smoldering with ghostly blue flame. The terms shift and blur: *Yield 900% in seven lunar cycles... or forfeiture of all collateral, including memories of your first kiss, the sound of rain on childhood windows, the scent of thyme in your grandmother’s garden.*  

Beneath your feet, the ground liquefies into a vortex of coins, each stamped with your own face aging rapidly—youthful hope curdling into hollow-eyed regret. A chorus of whispers drills into your skull, voices overlapping: *"Risk is the currency of gods,"* hisses one. *"Only fools kneel to doubt,"* sneers another, its tone glacially familiar—your own voice, warped.  

To your left, a bridge materializes, its planks forged from ivory credit slips, arcing toward a pulsating nebula where constellations form bull and bear skulls. To your right, a frayed rope ladder descends into a fog bank murmuring with the dirge of forgotten pensions and safe, stagnant portfolios.  

Your chest cavity rattles—a small iron vault has replaced your heart, its combination lock ticking backward. The air smells of ozone and desperation.  

As you reach for the contract, your hand phases through it, scattering into a thousand silver mites that scuttle into the abyss. The faceless figure croons, *"Decide before the numbers eat themselves."* Above, the sky cracks open, bleeding equations that spiral into black holes.  

You wake just as the first coin slips from your eyelids.
