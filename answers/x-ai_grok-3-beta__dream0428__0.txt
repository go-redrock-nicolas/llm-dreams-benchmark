I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, luminous meadow, where the grass shimmers like liquid emerald under a sky painted with swirling hues of lavender and gold. The air is warm, carrying the sweet scent of blooming flowers I cannot name, their petals unfurling in slow motion as if time itself has decided to linger here. My heart flutters with a quiet joy, a sense of accomplishment and peace that feels almost too perfect, too pristine. Yet, beneath this serenity, a familiar unease creeps in—an anxious whisper in the back of my mind, murmuring that this beauty cannot last, that something must surely go wrong.

I notice this discomfort, this shadow lurking in the glow of my dream, and I decide not to let it take root. I breathe deeply, letting the fragrant air fill my lungs, grounding myself in the moment. I stretch my arms wide, as if to embrace the entire landscape, and I begin to walk forward, each step deliberate, each step a choice to savor the now. The grass brushes against my bare feet, cool and soft, and I can feel the earth humming beneath me, a gentle pulse that matches the rhythm of my own heartbeat. I tell myself, “This is mine to enjoy. This happiness, this calm—I deserve it.”

As I wander deeper into the meadow, the world transforms around me. The flowers begin to glow, casting a soft, bioluminescent light, illuminating a path that wasn’t there before. I follow it, curiosity nudging me onward, until I reach a crystalline brook cutting through the field like a ribbon of liquid starlight. Its surface reflects not just the surreal sky above, but fleeting images of my own past joys—moments of laughter with loved ones, small victories, quiet mornings where the world felt kind. I kneel by the water’s edge, dipping my fingers into its cool depths, and the anxious whisper in my mind begins to fade, replaced by a gentle ripple of reassurance. Each memory reflected in the brook is a reminder: good things are not fleeting accidents waiting to be undone; they are real, tangible, and mine to hold.

Rising to my feet, I notice shimmering figures emerging from the mist on the far side of the brook—ethereal silhouettes of people I’ve cherished, their forms woven from light and memory. They don’t speak, but their presence wraps around me like a warm embrace, a silent chorus of encouragement. My anxiety, once a heavy stone in my chest, begins to dissolve, melting into the radiant air. I realize I don’t need to wait for the other shoe to drop; I can dance barefoot in this meadow instead, twirling with the ghosts of my happiest moments.

Suddenly, the sky above bursts into a symphony of color, as if celebrating my resolve. Fireworks of cobalt and crimson explode in slow, graceful arcs, their sparks drifting down like tiny lanterns to light the night that has gently fallen over the meadow. I laugh—a sound so free it surprises even me—and I run beneath this cosmic display, my feet barely touching the ground, feeling as if I could leap into the stars themselves. The anxious voice is gone now, replaced by a song I didn’t know I could sing, a melody of trust in the goodness surrounding me.

And so, in this dream, I choose to revel. I build a bonfire from twigs of glowing amber, its flames flickering with warmth and promise, and I sit beside it, watching the ethereal figures dance in the distance. I let myself believe that this beauty, this peace, is not a fleeting anomaly but a garden I can tend, a place I can return to even when I wake. My heart, once braced for collapse, now beats with the steady rhythm of possibility, and as the dream deepens, I know that I am learning to carry this meadow within me—a sanctuary of light to counter any shadow that dares to creep in.
