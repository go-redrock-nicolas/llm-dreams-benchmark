I am dreaming. As I dip into slumber, the transition feels neither abrupt nor gentle—it is as if I am sinking into a pool of warm, heavy velvet. The boundaries of the waking world blur and dissolve, replaced by a landscape that shifts like sand underfoot, undulating in a rhythm that echoes the pulse of an unseen tide.

I am standing on a narrow path carved into the side of a mountain. The air is thin but crisp, and the scent of damp earth mingles with the faint sweetness of wildflowers I cannot see. To my left, a sheer drop stretches into an impenetrable mist, while to my right, jagged cliffs rise like ancient giants frozen in time. My footsteps are silent, yet each stride reverberates as though the ground beneath me is alive, reverberating with a heartbeat.

Ahead, the trail narrows further, and the mist beneath begins to swirl, parting like a curtain pulled aside by invisible hands. The sight that emerges makes me pause, breath caught in my throat. A city of impossible scale stretches before me, carved into the side of a mountain range that seems crafted by the hands of giants. Lights pulse and shimmer from windows set into elaborate terraces, their glow casting long shadows over structures that resemble both cathedral and castle. Bridges of impossible elegance span impossible chasms, each arch adorned with patterns that shimmer like starlight on water.

Inexplicably, I am compelled to step onto one of the bridges. The structure feels both solid and ephemeral, as though it exists only because I will it to. Midway across, the air hums with a song I cannot quite hear but can feel in my bones. The dream bends. The bridge elongates, and I feel myself neither here nor there, suspended between what was and what could be. My heart races, and I look down to see the mist parting again—this time to reveal scenes of my own life, like chapters in a book I have forgotten I wrote.

One scene rises vividly: I am standing at a crossroads illuminated by the soft, golden light of a setting sun. The paths stretch before me like spokes on a wheel, each leading somewhere vague and shrouded. In this moment, a younger version of myself turns, catches my gaze, and for a fleeting second, I am certain they can see me. The familiarity is haunting, the recognition so deep that it feels like home. Yet, the dream shifts again, unwilling to let me linger, and I am pulled back into the city of impossible scale, its lights now brighter, its song louder, the path underfoot trembling with urgency.

Something—someone—is calling me. The voice is soft, pervasive, more emotion than sound. It speaks of memory and time and the spaces in between, of choices made and paths untaken. It is both comforting and terrifying, a reminder of the vastness that exists beyond comprehension. My dream-self tries to answer, but words catch in my throat.

And then, without warning, the dream collapses inward. I am on the bridge still, but now the path beneath me is disintegrating, falling into the mist below. I do not feel fear, only certainty, as though this, too, is part of the journey. I take a step forward, and my perspective shifts: I am no longer walking but flying, soaring through the canyon of my own subconscious. The air cracks with electricity, and I am surrounded by stars—or are they fragments of memory? The veil between dream and reality thins, and I understand, with aching clarity, that I am not simply dreaming. I am remembering.

As I wake, the dream lingers on my skin like dew, its pulse still humming in my veins. The memory of the city, the bridge, and the crossroads stays with me, a thread that connects the seen and the unseen, the known and the forgotten. For a moment, I am filled with the quiet certainty that the dream was more than a dream—it was a lesson, a truth hidden in plain sight, a guide etched in starlight and mist.

And then the world settles back into place, and the vivid edges of the dream begin to fade. But the memory remains, a soft glow in the fabric of my mind, waiting for the day when I will understand its meaning fully.
