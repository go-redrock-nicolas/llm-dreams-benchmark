I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

You’re on a crowded subway train humming through the darkness of an ancient underground tunnel. Fluorescent bulbs sputter and flicker overhead, painting everything in unnerving shades of yellowish gray. Faces look wan in that harsh light, and the air is thick with the smell of stale breath and lukewarm coffee. Then, suddenly, all the lights go out.

The train shudders to a halt, throwing everyone off balance. You hear yelps and curses, the crash of a dropped travel mug rolling down the aisle. The darkness is absolute—like the belly of a gargantuan beast. A tense hush washes over the crowd as people clench the overhead bars and each other’s arms. In the blackness, you can no longer see—only feel shoulders bumping, elbows stabbing, hearts pounding.

At first, only the quiet pings of phones display faint ghosts of light. The intermittent glows illuminate wide eyes and furrowed brows. Panic begins to spread. Someone is sobbing in the distance. Another person’s frantic breathing catches on the stale air. A disembodied voice tries to reassure everyone, but the unfamiliar intonation only heightens the sense of claustrophobic dread. Your heart thrums like a startled bird.

You close your eyes—though it hardly matters with nothing to see—and try to steady your own breathing. You force yourself to imagine the train will lurch back to life any second. Suddenly, a surge of sparks flares in the corridor ahead. Brilliant orange embers crackle and dance, illuminating the interior like a twisted carnival. For an instant, you see the silhouettes of fellow passengers: one with a backpack clutched tight to their chest, another standing with trembling knees, a mother cradling her child.

And then you spot it. Just beyond the sizzling sparks—where the train door stands—there’s the shape of a door you’ve never noticed before. It’s smaller than the rest, built into the very metal plating of the train, as though meant to be hidden. Intrigued, you take a decisive step forward, your pulse hammering in your ears. People around you are shouting for help, but they seem somehow frozen in the moment, voices echoing and bouncing across the train’s dark interior.

Curiosity compels you onward. You weave around other passengers, each of them like statues in your peripheral vision, caught in their own spiraling anxieties. You feel a strange push from behind—like a warm gust of air guiding you. As you approach the secret door, you notice intricate etchings carved into its surface. They resemble swirling runes, odd script reminiscent of ancient languages and secret spells.

Your hand hovers over the latch. It’s cold to the touch, sending a quiver through your fingertips. With a gentle push, the door creaks open—a shockingly small, child-sized portal leading into an even deeper darkness. The sudden hush is deafening, as if the cramped train has stopped breathing, waiting for your decision.

Heart pounding, you squeeze through the tight opening. Immediately, the darkness swallows you. It’s velvety, full of silent promise. Then, with a snap, or perhaps a flicker of your own lucidity, you find yourself in a dimly lit chamber. It’s crafted of coppery metal, rivets and bolts gleaming in shifting half-light. The ground is soft, as though covered in worn velvet, and the walls resonate with a low hum that thrums in your bones. Luminescent fungi splotch the corners like living lanterns, and vines with glistening silver tendrils creep down from hidden cracks in the ceiling.

Behind you, the peculiar little door slams shut. You hear the muffled echoes of the train’s interior—cries, frantic pleas, the hiss of trapped electricity—but they sound far, far away, as though belonging to another world. Ahead, a corridor beckons, laced with glowing patterns across the floor. The patterns remind you of some cosmic code—like the footprints of stars across midnight skies.

You take a few unsteady steps, no longer sure if you’re under the city or if you’ve crossed into a realm outside ordinary reality. The air is spiced with the scent of petrichor and something sweet, maybe honey or saffron. Strange illusions shimmer at the edges of your vision: you catch glimpses of your own reflection—a fleeting figure with wide eyes, wearing the expression of someone being tested.

You brush aside a hanging vine, and your hand comes away glimmering with golden dust. It pulses in your palm, momentarily lighting your skin as it sifts into the air. A sudden presence stirs behind you, prompting you to whirl around. There, in the soft luminescence, stands a figure cloaked in shadow and twisted branches. Their form is indistinct, as if part of them is fused with the wall, or perhaps they are the wall itself taking shape. They raise an arm that seems made of bark and copper filaments, pointing farther down the corridor, guiding you onward.

Though fear churns inside you, a peculiar warmth grows in your chest, the sense that you’re on the cusp of a majestic secret. A memory flickers in your mind of stargazing as a child, how the night used to feel boundless and alive. And so, with a breath that quakes in your lungs, you follow the guiding shadowy figure. Step by careful step, you leave behind the panic of the stranded subway train and walk with measured resolve into the unknown.

In the hush that follows, the corridor seems to stretch and curve like an endless ribbon, each turn revealing more mushroom lanterns and swirling vines, each with their own unique shade of ghostly glow. You hear a distant ring, like windchimes far away, and—somehow—you know it’s the thrum of the subway calling you back. But for now, your feet press forward, your hand skimming across the textured walls, thousands of dreamlike whispers echoing in your ears. A thrill builds in your chest—equal parts terror and wonder—because you sense that what lies ahead transcends ordinary comprehension.

And in that dream, you finally surrender to the feeling of adventure, letting it fill your veins with each breath. The panicked voices grow faint, the darkness no longer terrifies you. Only possibility surrounds you now, shining in the luminescent passage like a silent promise: you have stepped beyond the ordinary, carried by the clamor of a broken train into a secret realm. For that fleeting moment before you awaken, you are free.
