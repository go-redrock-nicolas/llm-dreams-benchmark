I am dreaming. Text is appearing in the air before me like glowing embers drifting upward from some unseen fire.  

The first path shimmers like liquid silver beneath a lavender sky—a ribbon of polished mercury twisting between vast, upside-down waterfalls that flow upward into floating islands wreathed in perpetual twilight. Distant laughter chimes like glass bells from the glowing cities suspended there, where winged scholars debate philosophy in libraries built inside hollowed-out comets. This future breathes with possibility: fingertips brushing against the spines of books that rewrite themselves daily, the scent of ink that tastes like newly discovered constellations.  

The second path crackles underfoot, a mosaic of broken mirrors reflecting jagged glimpses of a thousand simultaneous lives. Every step sends ripples through scenes flickering beneath the glass—a coronation here, a shipwreck there, a child blowing dandelion spores that become fireflies midair. The air vibrates with whispered crossroads: "Turn left and invent immortality," "Stumble and compose the anthem of the revolution." Shadows stretch long here, not from any light source, but from the weight of consequences yet to unfold.  

Between these branching futures, the ground beneath me has become transparent. Far below, my own reflection gazes upward—not as I am now, but as I might become down each road. The silver path version of me holds a key shaped like a question mark; the mirrored path self clutches a hourglass where the sands move sideways.  

Then the whisper comes, not in words but in texture—the sensation of tree bark against fingertips, the tartness of unripe blackberries, the exact pressure of a bowstring drawn taut. It needs no translation. The choice isn't about destinations at all, but about which texture of becoming calls louder to the marrow of your bones.
