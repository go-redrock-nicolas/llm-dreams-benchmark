I am dreaming. You begin by rising from a makeshift bed of battered cloth and gently crackling tarps, your body stiff and covered in a fine layer of gray dust. You rub your eyes, or at least what feels like your eyes, as this is a dream—though it’s so all-encompassing it feels alarmingly real. The world around you is washed out, desolate. Towers of twisted metal and glass shards jut skyward like broken bones, remnants of what was once a city brimming with life. The sun struggles to pierce a smoky sky, where swirling ash dances in weak amber light. The air is stale, tasting faintly of rust and regret.  

Your belly rumbles from weeks of hunger. You’ve survived on scraps salvaged from abandoned bunkers and tarnished grocery cellars, but these sources have dried up. You place a hand on your stomach and vow to press on. Ahead, a row of scorched vehicles line a ruined highway. Once, people might have driven them to work or on road trips through vibrant countryside. Now, the metal husks sit in silent testimony to a lost era. The battered road crumbles beneath your boots, releasing small puffs of lifeless dust with each step.  

But there, on the horizon, a surprising shimmer of color stands out—an old greenhouse, listing to one side, the glass mostly shattered. Inside, you glimpse a single, stubborn patch of green. Perhaps it’s a vine or some resilient moss. It thrums with unexpected life. Your heart seizes with hope at the possibility of fresh food, seed, or surplus water.  

An uneasy wind gusts past, carrying the distant howls of feral creatures. You can almost feel their scorching breath on your neck. Yet you press on, your grip tightening around your only weapon—an improvised spear of rebar and sharpened scrap metal. It’s not much, but it’s enough to fend off hungry eyes skulking in the ruins.  

Despite the perils, an odd sense of courage thrums in your veins. You’ve made it this far, beaten the odds, fought off despair day after day. Now, in your dream, you choose to walk boldly toward the greenhouse. You will salvage the seeds, rescue the plants, and rekindle hope that has all but vanished. And with every step you take, the ash-streaked world looks just a fraction brighter, a faint promise that sometimes, from the decay of the past, new life can be forged.
