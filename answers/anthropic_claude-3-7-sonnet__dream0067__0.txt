I am dreaming. I discover a slip of paper nestled in my hand, its edges crisp and clinical. My eyes scan the medical terminology sprawling across it like an incomprehensible map of my future—or what little remains of it. Months. Just months. The doctor's words echo in the hollow chamber of my mind, reverberating against memories I've yet to make.

The hospital corridor stretches before me, impossibly long and bathed in a light too white to be natural. My footsteps make no sound as I drift forward, disconnected from my body. The walls breathe—expanding and contracting with each of my shuddering breaths.

Outside, the world has transformed. Colors are more vibrant than I remember—the blue of the sky almost hurts to look at, deep and endless. Trees wave their arms in greeting, their leaves whispering secrets I never bothered to hear before. Has everything always been this beautiful? This alive?

Time becomes fluid. Days blur together yet each moment stretches into infinity. I find myself cataloging sensations: the rough texture of tree bark beneath my fingertips, the explosion of sweetness from a perfectly ripe strawberry, the comforting weight of my old dog's head on my lap.

In my bedroom, I discover a leather-bound journal I don't remember buying. As I open it, thousands of fireflies escape from between its pages, illuminating my darkened room with constellations of living light. Each one carries a memory I'd forgotten—my mother's laugh, my first kiss, the time I rescued a fledgling bird. They dance around me, these fragments of a life I hadn't fully appreciated.

I begin writing feverishly—not bucket lists, but love letters to everything I'll leave behind. To the morning coffee I'll miss. To the friends who shaped me. To the strangers I'll never meet.

And strangely, as the diagnosis settles into my bones, I feel something unexpected blooming in my chest—not fear, but a profound awakening. Each heartbeat becomes precious percussion, each breath a gift unwrapped in slow motion.

The dream shifts. I am standing on a cliff edge overlooking an ocean that spans forever. The horizon blurs the boundary between sea and sky, and I understand something essential but inexpressible about the nature of endings and beginnings.
