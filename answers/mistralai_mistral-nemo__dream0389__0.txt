I am dreaming. Once, I found myself standing in an expansive, verdant meadow, the kind that stretched out like a golden carpet as far as the eye could see. The sun hung overhead, a bloated, sunny-side-up egg yolk, spilling its warmth upon the world. A gentle zephyr wafted through the tall grass, making the blades sway in synchronized rhythm, like a sea of emerald waves.

Suddenly, I saw a figure in the distance, a human shape on a hillock, standing against the vast blue canvas of the sky. Curiosity piqued, I started walking towards it, my footsteps silent against the springy turf. As I approached, the figure took form - it was a version of myself, but heightened, an exaggerated reflection of my best attributes.

This other me stood proudly, hands on hips, surveying the landscape. And there, at their feet, was something I had long desired: a beautiful, intricately carved harp. The strings glistened like moonlit rain, each one a silver whisper promising songs yet unsung.

A warmth spread through me, a spark of pride and longing. But as I neared, I saw the hands of this better me wrap around the harp. They lifted it, their expression one of reverent ownership, and began to strum. The melody that filled the air was rich, resonant, and full of life. It was a song I had composed, one that had been rattling around in my head, halfway between hope and despair.

My heart panged. Jealousy reared its ugly head, its tendrils snaking around my insides, tightening like a vice. I watched this spectral version of me play my song, each note a rubbing salt into a raw wound. Why couldn't I do that? Why did it come so naturally to them?

I wanted to run, to flee from this scene of my own failure, but my feet rooted me to the ground. I looked down at my hands, expecting to see them filled with potential, but instead, they were empty. Hollow. The jealousy expanded, threatening to consume me. But then, something shifted.

I watched as several more figures - versions of me, again, but different - emerged from the grass. Each one carried a different instrument: a violin, a flute, a set of drums. They fell into place around the one with the harp, picking up the melody, adding their own harmonies. They merged my song with theirs, creating a symphony that was greater than the sum of its parts.

The jealousy began to fade, washed away by the music. I realized that each of these figures was a part of me, a version of me that had found its own rhythm, its own harmony. The one with the harp wasn't better than the others; they just had a different purpose.

I looked back at the hands of my 'better' self, envying their ease, their grace. But now, they were not holding a harp, but a tambourine. The song shifted again, welcoming my drumbeats, my rhythm, my melody. My emptiness filled. I was part of the symphony now. We were all part of the symphony, our music weaving together in a tapestry of notes and beats and harmonies that was uniquely ours.
