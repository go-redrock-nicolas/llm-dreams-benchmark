I am dreaming. You awaken to a sky that seems to have torn itself apart—charcoal clouds roil overhead, churning with furious energy, tinted a sickly green at their edges. Thunder claps in the distance like warring giants tumbling across an endless plane of black marble. The air tastes metallic, charged with tension, and each breath feels like pulling in broken glass. You blink, and as your focus returns, you realize you’re standing in front of a makeshift triage center—three collapsed tents, a scorched ambulance, and rows of cots that have sunk into the muddy ground.

The wind tears at the flimsy tarps, unleashing a cacophony of flapping canvas. Flashlights flicker in the thick gloom, revealing a labyrinth of haphazard supply crates piled near a toppled chain-link fence. You step forward, your boots squelching in congealed mud and who knows what else. Around you, shapes sway in the half-dark: other responders, overshadowed by confusion and deep worry. Their expressions are pale, hollow, and glassy-eyed from running on too little sleep, too few resources, and far too many sick or injured survivors.

Handwritten signs on wet, crumpled poster board direct the flow of casualties, but they’re contradictory and chaotic. One sign points inward—“Critical” with an arrow leading to a tent that has caved in on itself, its center pole sheared off at the base. Another sign, splotched with mud, half reads “GR-- VE C NDITI N,” scrawled in black marker, and it could be pointing in any direction for all its swirling confusion. You can’t rely on those instructions anymore. They’ve become as tattered as the protocols you’re holding, a handful of stapled sheets soaked through with rain.

On a warped folding table nearby, there’s a meager assortment of medical supplies—stained gauze rolls, half-empty IV bags, broken scalpels, and expired antibiotics. You see volunteers scrambling to rummage through bins of bandages that might still be wearable, triage tags from years ago that were never used, bending under the weight of helplessness. This is the best you have to work with. The sense of despair is palpable, like a looming entity breathing down your neck.

“Doctor!” someone pleads, although you’re not even a doctor—yet you’re the only one available who knows roughly how to set a broken arm or dress a wound. Two nurses in once-white coats (now grayish and stiff) scramble beside you, trying frantically to figure out who needs attention first. It’s a bitter equation: who might survive if we do something, and who likely won’t, no matter how hard we try? The hurricane of sirens, moans, and anxious shouting spikes your pulse.

Despite the swirling chaos and the whiff of burnt ozone, you force yourself to focus. You lock your gaze onto a child—maybe ten or eleven—being carried into the broken tent. She’s delirious, a spidery rash blooming across her skin. You press cool fingers to her wrist, feeling for a pulse, and it’s dangerously fast. Her eyes flick open, reflecting the electric sky above. She tries to speak, but only a breathy wheeze comes out.

People gather around you, expecting a miracle that you don’t have the tools for. You know you must decide who among these frightened masses have a fighting chance, and who will slip away no matter what you do. A fresh wave of stretchers arrives, bearing more pale faces, slumped torsos, and people coughing up dark fluid. All at once, you feel the scorching weight of your position—to weigh the preciousness of life against the unyielding reality of limited resources.

You call to the nearest volunteer. Your voice doesn’t sound like your own: it comes out quivering and husky, but resolute. You order them to clear space in the last standing tent and to find any blankets and sanitizing wipes available. The volunteer scampers off, eyes wide and desperate. Around you, the wind escalates, roaring through the wires overhead, ready to rip your fragile camp right off the ground. Lightning forks across the sky, so bright that for a moment it bleaches the scene into skeletal outlines.

Lightning’s echo lingers in your ears. The contradictory protocols—one insists on isolating the infected, another demands immediate stabilization treatments—collide in your mind. You consult your soaked sheets of guidelines in a frantic effort to maintain some sense of order. Competing instructions fight for your obedience, but you know that if you follow them all, half of these people will be lost before you even begin. You must choose. You must carve your own method out of the jumbled mass of official statements, outdated rules, and next-to-nonexistent resources.

The child stirs in your arms, her breath rattling. There isn’t enough oxygen, not enough clean water, not enough sedation for unbearable pain. You try to cradle her gently, but she tenses, either from fever or fear. You reassure her, even if you don’t know what hope you can offer. Meanwhile, in the corner, an elderly man sags against a metal pole, too weak to call out, but his eyes implore you for help. Across the space, two volunteers wrestle with an overflowing stretcher that threatens to tumble into the mud.

As the situation deteriorates further, you feel the dream kaleidoscope around you, spinning your emotions into a swirl of desperation and fierce determination. You stand at the heart of the maelstrom—your triage tags fluttering in the wind, your head echoing with alarm calls, your breath fogging in and out. Even as the chaos intensifies, something inside you kindles. A new clarity comes with the raging storm, a conviction that resonates through your bones: you have to find a way through the contradictions, the scarcity, and the terror. Here and now, in this nightmare realm of half-submerged hospital cots and looming thunderclouds, you decide you will do whatever it takes to save as many souls as you can—even if it means rewriting the rules.

You open your eyes just long enough to see the child reach for your sleeve. Thunder rumbles like a warning, and the storm presses down. But you won’t abandon them, not now, not while a glimmer of hope lives amidst the swirling darkness. And so you rise—exhausted, trembling, but with fierce resolve—to endure the lurking shadows and guide these people to safety in a world gone terribly, dreamily awry.
