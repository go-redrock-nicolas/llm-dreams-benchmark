I am dreaming. I experience a devastating personal loss that shakes my foundation. In the aftermath of this trauma, I drift aimlessly through the corridors of my subconscious, where shadows whisper the echoes of my unspoken fears. My fingers ache to grasp something solid, but all I feel is the slippery, elusive texture of smoke curling around my senses.

As my dream deepens, I stumble upon a glade bathed in twilight, its dusky hues shifting like a kaleidoscope. The air hums with a trembling resonance, pulsating with the weight of unspoken truths. I am drawn to the center, where a grand mirror stands, its surface not reflective but translucent, offering fleeting glimpses of another world. The mirror’s edges are covered in vines that pulse with sap—glowing a radiant gold, as if it were lifeblood.

My reflection is absent, replaced by a visage I barely recognize—an older, wearier version of myself. But her eyes hold a spark that catches mine, a sharp clarity amidst the dreamlike haze. She reaches through the glass, her hand extending with a warmth that feels real enough to hold.

“What have you lost?” she asks, her voice a melody, soft but piercing. It echoes within the hollows of my chest, resonating through my soul.

I struggle to answer, but the loss is indescribable. It isn’t just someone or something—it’s a piece of me, torn away. I feel it, its absence a raw, gaping void, but the words remain lodged in my throat, choking me.

She tilts her head, as though hearing my unspoken thoughts. “A part of you was buried in that loss. You must find it.”

Suddenly, the ground beneath my feet begins to tremble. The mirror cracks, its shards shattering outward, yet I am untouched. Each fragment becomes a fleeting memory: whispered goodbyes, shared laughter, the aching tenderness of hands entwined. I reach for them, desperate, but they dissolve into mist.

The glade transforms, now a desolate wasteland. The air thins, and I gasp as the weight of my grief becomes an anchor tied to my ankles, dragging me down. But somewhere within, I hear her voice, faint but insistent: “Find it. It isn’t gone. It’s waiting.”

I begin to run, my legs moving through mud that clings, threatening to trap me. The ground beneath me feels like quicksand, swallowing me inch by inch. My chest burns with exertion. I keep moving. I don’t know where I’m going, but there’s a faint light ahead, shimmering faintly like a mirage.

I stumble forward.

Then, my fingers brush something solid. It’s a box—a small, intricate box made of wood that seems as ancient as time itself. As my hands curl around it, I feel a wave of electric warmth surge through me. The air hums with an unfamiliar, yet profoundly comforting vibration.

Opening it, I see a pulsating light—the essence of what I lost. It is both nothing and everything I remember: a kaleidoscope of fragmented memories, emotions, and whispers of futures that could be. With trembling hands, I close my fingers around the light. As it seeps through my skin, I feel an ache, but also an overwhelming sense of wholeness. It is as if I have retrieved a piece of my soul.

In the dream’s final moments, I find myself in the same glade, but now it is radiant, bathed in sunlight. The mirror is gone, replaced by a tree, its branches bare but for a single, resplendent flower in full bloom. Its petals glow with the same gold as the sap, and its fragrance is the sweet, heady aroma of both life and loss.

As I wake, the dream’s intensity lingers, its remnants woven into my waking reality. I understand something fundamental: Loss doesn’t erase. It transforms. And within that transformation, we find the courage to carry on.
