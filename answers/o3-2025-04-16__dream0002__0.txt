I am dreaming. …and the air thickens with a metallic tang, as though rainclouds have been forging silver swords overhead. A hush falls; even the birds clamp their songs behind folded wings. You glance up to see the canopy swirling like a living kaleidoscope—branches bending, leaves flipping from emerald to obsidian as shadows through them thicken.  

A single droplet kisses your cheek, shockingly cold, the way a coin from a glacier-fed stream might feel upon the palm. Another lands—then dozens, then hundreds—until rain drums the soil in a syncopated frenzy, filling every hollow log and deer track with quivering mirrors. The forest path dissolves into liquid brushstrokes beneath your boots, but your feet keep moving as if guided by some secret choreography.  

A flash cleaves the sky: lightning, white-gold and serpentine, forks through the storm-bellied clouds. In the instant of brilliance you spot something impossible—a floating, rootless tree, its trunk pure crystal, suspended where thunder should be. It spins slowly, barkless and luminescent, branches hung with dangling prisms that catch the lightning and refract it into ribbons of color. They lash out across the forest like a painter’s wildest gesture, coating the trunks in rippling violet and cerulean flames that neither burn nor wither.  

Drawn toward it, you wade through ankle-deep puddles that glow from within—each one a tiny universe in which miniature storms blossom and dissipate on repeat. Your breaths form silver motifs in the mist, curling into runes that hover, then shatter into tinkling bells.  

The rumble of thunder deepens, but it’s no longer only sky-born. The earth beneath you hums, vibrating like a vast cello string. Ferns uncurl as though awakening from centuries of sleep, their fronds studded with droplets that turn to glass beads, tinkling softly when they touch. Where lightning touches ground, mushrooms erupt instantaneously—porcelain white caps marbled with indigo veins, emitting a soft bioluminescence that illuminates the undergrowth.  

Suddenly an updraft lifts every loose leaf around you into a swirling halo. In their cyclone you glimpse images—memories not your own: a cliff-side orchard at dawn, a whale soaring above polar mountains, the quiet grin of a child forging stars out of dandelions. Each vision flashes for a heartbeat, then becomes a glowing leaf and joins the whirling dance.  

As you reach the clearing beneath the floating crystal tree, the rain abruptly halts. Droplets freeze mid-air like pearls on invisible strings, a three-dimensional constellation around you. In the hush you hear the tree’s inner resonance—an ethereal chime that seems to play every note you’ve ever loved all at once: lullabies, laughter, the hiss of a match sparking hope in darkness.  

Compelled, you place your palm against the tree’s cool, luminous trunk. Light pours up your arm in threads of opal, weaving through muscle and bone, rewriting gravity’s rules. Your feet leave the ground. The forest falls away, framed now in jeweled drops and blossoming thunderclouds.  

Above the storm ceiling, you burst into an ocean of stardust. The sky here is purple wine, scattered with constellations shaped like creatures no myth has dared name. You glide through them, weightless, as echoes of distant galaxies pulse beneath your skin. Comets drift close enough to touch; each contact splashes you with fragrant sparks that smell of cedar and cinnamon.  

Then, far below, you see the forest again, but it is mirrored on the surface of a colossal lake that was never there before—a lake so still it reflects not only the world but the very concept of silence. The crystal tree has rooted itself mid-lake, branches now ablaze with sunrise hues though dawn is nowhere near.  

With a gentle exhale you descend, rain droplets thaw and fall, finishing their interrupted journeys to earth. The storm’s edge retreats, unveiling a sky as clear and new as polished quartz. Around you the forest glitters, reborn: mosses shimmer jade, bark pulses like molten bronze, spiderwebs string hummingbird feathers between twigs.  

And in that breathless calm, you realize the storm was never a threat but an invitation—an elemental overture beckoning you to witness creation in motion. You close your eyes, feeling the pulse of that living, jewel-bright world settle into your heartbeat.  

When you open them, you are back on the forest path, beneath an ordinary green canopy. Sunlight dapples the ground, and a mild breeze kisses your temple. Yet the memory of color-fueled lightning and crystal roots thrums beneath your ribs, a secret anthem only dreamers can hear.  

Somewhere behind you, a single bell-like chime rings—soft, unmistakable—reassuring you that though you woke within the dream, the dream itself remains wide awake within you.
