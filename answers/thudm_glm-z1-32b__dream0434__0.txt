I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a luminous, ever-shifting bridge that spans a chasm of swirling, iridescent color. To my left, a forest of bioluminescent trees pulses like a heartbeat, their roots entwined with ancient, whispering runes. Each leaf seems to hold memories—of summer storms, childhood laughter, and the scent of rain-soaked earth. To my right, a fleet of silver sailboats glides silently across a sea of liquid twilight, their hulls etched with star maps that glow faintly. The air hums with the vibrational syntax of this place, where time bends around my fingertips.

The bridge itself is made of filaments of stardust, each strand humming with its own frequency. As I step forward, the vibrations grow louder, and I realize that every movement shifts the balance between the two realms. I hear the whisper of a thousand voices—some urging me to run toward the forest's embrace, where safety and familiarityawait; others pleading for me to chase the horizon on the sailboats, toward lands where the rules of gravity don't apply. The air tastes of ozone and possibility, and my shadow stretches into the void, trembling with the weight of each choice.

As I reach the midpoint, the bridge begins to ripple like a pond disturbed by a pebble. The forest's whispers grow urgent, their rhythm syncing with the beat of my left side. The sailboats bob higher, their masts catching nonexistent winds, as if the universe is rooting for me to leap. My pulse quickens, but I feel something stir in me—a third path. The bridge's filaments start weaving into new patterns, forming a spiral staircase that descends into the chasm. It spirals deeper, where the colors become more intense, more alive. Something ancient and newborn stirs in that vortex, and I'm drawn to it like moths to flame.

As I descend, the world shifts again. The forest and the sea merge into a unified horizon, their energies blending into a single, pulsating heartbeat. The staircase leads to a chamber where the air is thick with starlight and raw creativity. In the center, a tree grows, its trunk made of liquid shadow, and its branches reaching toward me, each leaf a different version of the choices I've faced. Some leaves glow with triumph, others with lessons learned. The wind carries the scent of ancient wisdom, and I realize I can pluck any leaf and see its story.

But as my hand reaches out, the bridge behind me starts to dissolve, its stardust strands unraveling like smoke. The sailboats melt into the sea, their masts curling like smoke. The forest's whispers fade, replaced by the silence of a decision yet to be made. The staircase pulses, its spiral inviting me to claim the tree, but the path upward is gone. Now, I must choose: descend further into the unknown, embrace the tree and its infinite possibilities, or return to the bridge's remnants, which flicker like dying embers.

The chasm below swirls with energy, a kaleidoscope of every choice I've ever postponed, every question unanswered. My heart races, but something stirs in my gut—a hunger to not just choose, but to create. I step off the staircase, and the world tilts. The tree's roots reach out, wrapping around my ankles, pulling me down, where the colors dissolve into a luminous mist. When I wake, the first thing I notice is the sun streaming through my window, but the taste of starlight lingers on my tongue, and the hum of the bridge remains in my bones, a promise that some paths are never truly closed.
In the ethereal nexus between waking and slumber, I find myself suspended above a chasm that defies both depth and dimension. The abyss below is not merely empty space but a fractal tapestry of half-remembered regrets and untapped potentials—a swirling vortex where yesterday’s coffee mug smashes with tomorrow’s unopened letter. To my left, a forest of liquid mercury trees stands, their trunks shimmering with constellations that flicker on and off like faulty porch lights. The leaves here are lungs, expanding and contracting in synchronous breaths that sound suspiciously like the laughter of long-lost friends. Every rustle reveals a secret: a whispered apology, a half-formed love poem, a promise kept in another lifetime. The soil here is not dirt but a living continuum, granules that sparkle when brushed but vanish when caught, like stardust fleeing a child’s clenched fist.

To my right, a fleet of sailboats crafted from folded paper sails past, each vessel carrying a cargo hold filled with static from staticky radios, the faint hum of a refrigerator left on in a room I no longer inhabit, and the echoes of unresolved arguments. The sea itself is made of memory foam, soft and yielding but insistent on retaining its shape, refusing to be smoothed out by the wake of these vessels. The sailors are shadows with faces that shift depending on the angle of the light—sometimes they resemble me, sometimes my childhood best friend who moved away before I learned to say goodbye properly. Their voices are the hiss of a faulty record player, replaying the same ten seconds of a song played on repeat since 1997.

The bridge I stand on is neither solid nor insubstantial. It is a riddle made of static and possibility, each step a choice between gravity and levity. The planks here are not wood but the pages of a journal I never kept, edges frayed from imagined rewrites of history. When I shift my weight, the bridge creaks not with age but with the anticipation of becoming a poem that no one will read. The air smells like burnt toast and the faintest hint of lavender from a sachet I once left in a suitcase that never made it to the airport.

As I begin to cross, the forest’s leaves start to recite passages from plays I never wrote, lines like *“To be is to decide between the one thing you should do and the million things you could do”* and *“The path less traveled is just a metaphor until you actually try to walk it.”* The paper sailboatsangling their masts in the memory foam sea, their captains yelling instructions in languages I barely recognize—Swedish, maybe, or the dialect of a café I frequented once in a city that doesn’t exist. The bridge starts to play a melody on its own, a dissonant scale of minor chords strummed by the wind through its staticky planks.

Halfway across, I notice a third path emerging—not as a divide but as a stream of liquid time. It zigzags between the forest’s lungs and the sea’s foam, its edges blurring like a watercolor painting left in the rain. This path is made of simultaneous possibilities: the comfort of a childhood blanket folded neatly on a bed I’ll never sleep in again, the thrill of a first kiss frozen in amber, and the dread of a phone call I’ll answer tomorrow but always seem to miss. When I touch it, my dissolves into the stream, and for a moment, I am both the decider and the decided-upon, the architect and the building.

The world tilts, and suddenly, I am standing on the edge of a cliff that wasn’t there before. Below, the chasm has deepened into a canyon where entire universes are folded like origami, some blooming into sunsets, others collapsing into black holes that sigh like tired therapists. The forest tears itself apart to form a staircase, each step a different shade of regret, while the sailboats transform into hot air balloons, their paper sails now canvas, floating above the canyon like escaped thoughts.

I jump. Not because I want to fly but because the bridge dissolves into a constellation of question marks, and the path below finally makes sense: it’s not a destination but a dialogue, a continuous conversation between the me that is and the me that could be. As I fall and then rise, buoyed by the gravity of choices I’ve yet to make, I realize that every decision is merely a pivot point, and the chasm is just a waiting room for the next question. The dream ends not with an answer but with a question mark that tastes like mint and sounds like static, a reminder that some questions are better left unanswered because the journey is the only thing that ever was, is, and will be worth remembering.
