I am dreaming. 

The world around me ripples like heat rising from asphalt, shimmering at the edges as if reality itself is unsure of its form. I stand on the edge of a skybound city, where tall, spiral towers of glass and light stretch endlessly into the heavens, their tips vanishing into clouds shaped like sleeping faces. The wind hums a forgotten lullaby, and each note wraps around my skin like threads of memory.

I’m in the middle of a marketplace suspended in the air — tethered to nothing, floating. Stalls are stitched together from folded starlight and sell not wares, but emotions: bottles of childhood laughter, jars humming with heartbreak, umbrellas that shower you with calm. Creatures with coral-like skin and liquid silver limbs trade stories in a language made of hummingbird wings.

Then, it happens.

Down the cloud-paved avenue approaches a figure cloaked in storm. Their steps crackle with static, and behind them floats a shadow not cast by light, but by absence. As they draw near, I feel the heat of anger ignite in my chest — raw, invasive, a needle of fire in my veins. The figure whispers something I can’t quite hear, but their tone — condescending and cruel — cuts like a shard of winter.

I feel the impulse rising: a scream, a strike, action without thought, a storm to match a storm. My hands twist into fists, electricity sparking at my fingertips. Every part of me wants to lash out, retaliate, freeze them with words sharp enough to draw blood.

But somewhere deep within — past the ego, the fear, the reflexive flinch — I feel a tremor of light within my lungs. A breath that isn’t mine, breathed into me by some older version of myself. I hear a chime in my bones — not loud, not jarring, but certain. And in an instant, as if I have slowed the pulse of time itself, **I catch myself**.

Right there. In the invisible space between **stimulus** and **response**.

It’s an ancient pause — a sacred gap stitched with twilight. Time doesn't stop, but it stretches. The anger is still there, flickering like wildfire, but now I see it in slow motion — the way a falcon watches the flight of a sparrow before deciding to dive or soar on.

Within this pause is a question that echoes not in thought, but in soul-memory:  
**Who will I choose to be here, when no one else is looking — not even me?**  

The world around me stills — not a forced silence, but the breath before creation. My heart beats once in triple time, as if three selves coincide in one: the hurt one, the wise one, the one still becoming. I feel like a prism turning in a shaft of moonlight, fragmenting the blaze of reaction into a spectrum of choices.

Then, like a petal released from the mouth of the wind, **I choose movement over violence**.

I don’t strike. I don’t speak sharply. I don’t descend. I rise — gently, like stardust learning to float. The figure in storm moves past me, and though their shadow tries to wrap its cold fingers round my ankle, I step out like stepping off a cliff and into sky. I don’t fall — I fly.

The marketplace bursts into soft, golden light around me, turning grief and fury into threads of art, into symphonies sewn into silence.  

And in my chest?

A quiet blazing fire — no longer wild, but warm.

Forever lit.

Always choosing.
