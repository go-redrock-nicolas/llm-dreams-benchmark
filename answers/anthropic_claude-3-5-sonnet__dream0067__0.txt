I am dreaming. As the doctor's words echo in my hollow mind - "6 months, maybe 8" - I find myself suddenly transported to a vast meadow bathed in a peculiar violet twilight. The grass beneath my feet isn't green but shimmers with translucent crystals, each blade catching and refracting the strange light like countless tiny prisms. Time feels viscous here, flowing like honey dripping from a spoon.

In the distance, I notice an ancient grandfather clock standing alone, its wooden frame twisted and gnarled like an old tree. Its hands spin wildly backward and forward, and with each rotation, I watch my own hands age and grow young again. Wrinkles appear and smooth away like ripples on water. My skin glows and fades like autumn leaves changing colors.

A child approaches - but she's not quite human. Her hair flows upward defying gravity, composed of floating galaxies and nebulae. When she speaks, her voice sounds like wind chimes made of memories. "Time isn't a straight line," she says, "it's a dance." She takes my hand, and suddenly we're waltzing through seasons - spring blooms erupting and withering in seconds, snow falling upward from the ground to the sky.

I begin to understand that the diagnosis isn't an ending but a doorway. Each heartbeat becomes precious, glowing like a firefly in my chest. The air tastes like stardust and possibilities. The child-galaxy leads me to the clock, and I see my reflection in its face - not my current self, but all my selves at once, layered like pages in a book.

The violet sky opens like a blooming flower, revealing corridors of light stretching into infinity. My remaining months aren't a countdown but an expansion. Each moment spreads out like ripples in a cosmic pond, containing eternities within eternities. I feel my consciousness expanding, becoming one with the crystalline grass, the backwards snow, the galaxy-haired child...

And then I wake, tears on my pillow, but they taste like starlight.

The dream lingers like music after the orchestra has stopped playing, leaving me with a profound sense that time is more than just a ticking clock - it's a kaleidoscope of infinite possibilities, even when it seems most finite.
