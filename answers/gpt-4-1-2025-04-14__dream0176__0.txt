I am dreaming. …grip the steering wheel as if it’s the only anchor to reality. The world outside the windshield rushes toward me—a kaleidoscopic blur of headlights, neon shop signs, and urgent, swirling taillights. My heart hammers a warning in my chest. Wind whistles through the cracked window, carrying the distant sound of a train and the scent of midnight rain on hot asphalt. Each second grows elastic and syrupy, stretching to the breaking point.

Desperate, I slam my foot on the unresponsive brake pedal again and again. Nothing. The car careens faster and faster, the engine roaring with a hungry animal’s growl. Tires screech. I yelp, half in terror, half in hope that I’ll wake up before disaster. The city around me bends and shimmers—buildings stretching upward like jagged glass mountains, traffic lights flickering between scarlet wrath and cool emerald calm.

Then—in that impossible way dreams allow—the world twists. Time fractures, slows, and I sense every raindrop on the windshield, every whispered prayer from my lips. My car lifts from the blacktop, wheels no longer gripping but skating on a shimmering ribbon of moonlight that stretches over the chaos ahead. I look out and realize I am flying, not falling—born aloft by some invisible force, soaring above the tangle of traffic below.

I am weightless, suspended between panic and awe. Below, tiny horns bleat and fingers point upward, but I soar serenely, gliding over rooftops and treetops dusted with golden streetlamp halos. The city becomes a living diorama, sparkling and impossibly beautiful from this height. The failed brakes, the fear, even the doomed traffic all fade behind the gossamer curtain of dream logic. I am free—unbound from gravity, unburdened by accident or fate—riding the ether toward wherever the dream might carry me next.
