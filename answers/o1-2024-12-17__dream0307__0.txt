I am dreaming. …feel yourself gently lifted from the boundaries of your body, as if an ethereal wind has carried your essence into a realm beyond normal sight. This place teems with radiant colors that no human eye has ever truly perceived—soft pinks that seem to whisper of ancient hopes, dusky blues tinted with an undercurrent of harmony, and golden threads shimmering like living light beams dancing in the distance.

You become aware of a subtle hum, an ever-present vibration that resonates in perfect symmetry with your heartbeat. It feels like the song of the universe itself, a throbbing lullaby composed of star pulses and cosmic echoes. As you focus on the sound, you begin to see the shape it creates: swirling motes of luminescence that swirl around you in a joyous spiral, painting a shifting tapestry across the sky. They draw patterns so intricate you can’t help but marvel, patterns reminiscent of galaxies unfolding and refolding with each breath.

A warm presence at your back urges you deeper into this realm. You turn to find a tall, robed figure made entirely of milky starlight. It has no distinct face, but its aura radiates love and tranquility. This radiant being gestures toward a pathway of glowing lotus flowers that appear out of nowhere, each bloom opening like an invitation to step forward. With cautious wonder, you place your foot on the first blossom. It feels like walking on softly spinning clouds: there is give and motion under your feet, but also undeniable support.

The path leads to an immense tree made of crystal. It shimmers with internal rainbows, fracturing the surrounding light into an ever-changing mosaic on the ground. Its branches sprawl like arms of the cosmos reaching out to hold you. As you approach, each leaf on the tree sings a different note, forming a symphony of color and sound. The lullaby from earlier grows stronger, somehow swirling within your chest and enveloping you in a sense of absolute unity.

Touching the crystal trunk sends gentle pulses through your fingertips. Suddenly, you see fleeting glimpses of forgotten dreams and buried aspirations—lost moments from childhood, flashes of kindness you extended or received, and memories of deep longing. Each vision weaves itself into a tapestry that wraps around you like a grand cosmic blanket. You feel all these experiences coalesce into a single, resonating truth: you are connected to every living thing, from the smallest drop of water to the largest star suspended in the endless expanse of space.

Overcome with insight and gratitude, you press your hand firmly against the tree. At once, the trunk glows brighter, almost blindingly so, flooding your senses with a warmth that feels like pure acceptance and unconditional love. Time drifts away into nonexistence, and you sense yourself dissolving into the luminous fabric of the dream, floating as a thread in the grand tapestry of creation.

In the distance, a gentle voice calls your name, resonating in the language of breath and heartbeat. As you turn toward the sound, the world fades into a swirling swirl of pastel lights, carrying you deeper into the mysterious, infinite flow of the dream. Beneath that cascading haze of color, you know with certainty that this spiritual threshold has given you a glimpse of something sacred, something that transcends the confines of ordinary life.

And in this moment of total immersion, you breathe in the universe—and the universe breathes in you.
