I am dreaming.

The world around me is woven from threads of mist and color—walls dissolve into rippling silks, and the floor beneath my feet undulates with soft golden light. I stand in the heart of a grand library whose ceilings soar into a twilight sky, suspended lanterns casting dappled constellations upon a thousand ancient tomes. Each book hums quietly, their stories pulsing in the air like distant music.

Suddenly, I'm summoned to a sunlit alcove where my colleagues await at a long, crystalline table that floats a few inches above a mirror-like pool. Their faces are familiar but subtly transformed: eyes bright with expectation, hands restless with urgency. Scattered across the table are blueprints for a project—a mosaic destined to crown the entrance of a cathedral made of living marble.

The project manager, with a cloak stitched from shifting clouds, leans in. "We must finish before dusk," she says, her voice both kind and insistent. "But much as we love your intricate tiles, today speed must lead."

A tension unfurls inside me, part yearning, part defiance. I glance at the raw, unlabeled tiles; each one waits to be polished and placed with the care that breathes soul into stone. My hands ache—not with exhaustion, but with the craving to honor every detail, to coax perfection from the mundane.

The dream twists languidly. I feel time press against me: a river swelling, threatening to tear down the banks. Around me, others start to work, fitting tiles haphazardly. The patterns lose their meaning, swirling into chaos. The vision of the cathedral shudders—the colors dull, the magic sputters out.

I cannot abandon what I know to be right. With deliberate slowness, I select a tile. Its surface blooms with hidden rainbows as I polish it. I feel the grain, the potential, the centuries of stonework echoing in my veins. Each tile I place is a promise—a vow to the craft, to beauty, to the silent power of doing things *well*, not just quickly.

My colleagues sigh, some in frustration, others in awe. The sun, instead of racing toward the horizon, seems to pause, granting me a little more gold. As I fit the last tile—a deep azure flecked with silver—the mosaic springs to life. Birds rise from it, singing. The cathedral’s doors swing open, pouring out a gentle breeze filled with the scent of rain on stone. The project, now complete, is not the product of haste, but an enduring testament to imagination, patience, and honor.

The dream lingers, warm with satisfaction. I wake with marble dust on my fingertips and a quiet conviction: some dreams—and some masterpieces—are worth every extra moment we can give them.
