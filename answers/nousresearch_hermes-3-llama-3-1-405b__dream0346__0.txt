I am dreaming. I’m lost in a vast hall of mirrors.  Reflected in each one is a crowd of people.  Their eyes are vacant.  Their whispers indiscernible.  I feel invisible and transparent, my presence cannot be perceived no matter how much I try to scream or wave my hands in front of them.  It’s like I’m on the other side of a soundproof glass wall, an impenetrable divide between me and the world.

I am the ghost wandering through the bustling city, unnoticed, unwanted.  The faces of the people I pass are blurry, their conversations are just static, like a radio out of tune.  I walk and walk, shivering in the cold loneliness that enshrouds me, a bitter wind that even the warm energy of the crowd can’t keep at bay.  

Suddenly, a crack in the pavement catches my foot and I start to fall.  Somehow, gravity pulls me horizontally instead of vertically and I am sucked into an opened door.  When I feel solid ground beneath me again, I find myself in a completely different place.  

I am now in a place of vibrant colours, where fireflies dance like tiny stars, and the ephemeral glow of the aurora borealis swirls overhead.  I walk through a magical garden, drunk with the scent of night-blooming flowers.  I hear laughter, and I am magically drawn to it.  Soon, I find myself sitting around a crackling bonfire, surrounded by warm and welcoming faces.  

Here, I am not a ghost.  Here, they can hear me.  I tell them my stories and they laugh with me.  I listen to theirs, and I feel the warmth of shared experiences and empathy.  We roast marshmallows and speak of our dreams, our fears, our triumphs, and our losses.  Connection, raw and real, envelops me like a comforting blanket.  

Our laughter echoes through the abyss of the night, and as the fire dims, a profound sense of peace settles within me.  I look up and marvel at the shimmering stars.  When I close my eyes, the laughter, the conversations, the crackling of the fire, and the dancing stars remain burned in the back of my eyelids.  

Even when I wake up, the memory of that connection, that warmth, that shared humanity remains with me.  I hold onto it like a talisman, a reminder that even in the depths of loneliness, there exists the possibility of finding true connection and camaraderie.
