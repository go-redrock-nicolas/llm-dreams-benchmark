I am dreaming. It's like I've stepped into an abstract painting come to life. Colors swirl around me in spirals - - ruby reds transitioning to a cerulean blue, then into something that looks like liquid silver. My hands pass through these pigments, and they feel warm. I’m weightless. I float toward a glowing portal. It feels inevitable.

As I pass through the portal, I find myself in a place that feels like my childhood bedroom. But it's expanded, transformed. The walls are lined with bookshelves, towering and endless, full of books with my name written in gold foil. Each one is titled with a moment from my childhood. I reach for one titled “The Fourth Birthday Party.” When I open it, the room shifts. I’m now at that party. I’m four again, wearing a dinosaur costume, and standing awkwardly beside a piñata shaped like a dragon. My classmates are laughing, but I’m feeling excluded. The piñata is never hit; it just dangles, unsmashed. I can feel the loneliness then, sharp as a needle. The book snaps shut. I'm back in the library. The shelves now have a new book: “Learning to Ride a Bike Without Training Wheels.” Opening it, I’m sixteen again. My dad’s hands steadying me, but he’s not looking at me. His eyes are on a distant clock tower, anxious, like he’s late for something. His voice is soft. “You’ve got this.” I wobble, fall. Scraped knees, the taste of dirt, the relief when I finally balance. But his attention was always half elsewhere. Now, I see that. The book closes.

A voice echoes, not a voice, more like a vibration I feel in my chest: “You are the archivist of your own history. To understand now, you must first mourn then.”

I look down and see a river before me, its surface like mercury. On the other side, there’s a door made of light. To cross the river, I have to let go of a small stone I didn’t realize I was holding. The stone is labeled "Anger at Dad for never watching me bike." I hesitate, but the current pulls me toward the door. When I let it go, the stone dissolves, releasing fireflies. They spiral upwards, dissolving into starlight. The door opens. On the other side is a garden where time blooms and withers in seconds. A figure stands there, their face a shifting mosaic of my loved ones. They speak with my mother’s laugh, my partner’s cadence. “You see how the past weaves into now? The fears of exclusion, the craving for full presence. They shape how you love—hesitant, but reaching. This is not a cage. It’s thread. You can choose to mend or unravel.”

I wake, the taste of starlight on my tongue, and understand that my heart has always been a palimpsest.
