I am dreaming. One day, while walking through a dense forest, you stumble upon a small cottage nestled among the towering oak and maple trees. The door creaks open as you approach, revealing a quaint living room adorned with hand-crafted furniture and antiques. Curiosity overtakes you, and before you even realize what's happening, you find yourself stepping across the threshold into this mysterious abode.

As you explore the one-story cottage, it feels as though time stands still. Every breath you take seems to clear your lungs of the toxic air from your workplace. The walls are covered in warm, earthy tones that mirror the hues of the forest outside. Sunlight streams through the large windows, casting dappled patterns on the wooden floorboards.

In the corner of the room, there's a cozy fireplace with a wooden mantle bearing intricate carvings of wildlife. A stack of perfectly split firewood sits next to it, inviting you to start a blaze. Next to the fireplace, there's a comfortable armchair upholstered in deep burgundy velvet. It beckons you to sit and rest your weary body.

As you wander down the dimly lit hallway, you notice three doors leading to different rooms. The first door leads to a spacious kitchen with a large wooden table covered in a crisp white tablecloth. The table is set with a gleaming silver cutlery and delicate porcelain plates adorned with fresh fruit, homemade bread, cheese, and sliced meats.

The odor of freshly brewed coffee wafts from the coffeemaker sitting on the counter. Beside it, there's a carafe filled with steaming hot cocoa. Without another thought, you pour yourself a cup of coffee and take a sip. It tastes rich and smooth, unlike any coffee you've ever had before.

With your curiosity peaked, you move on to the second door. It opens to reveal a warm and inviting bedroom with a massive canopy bed draped in embroidered silk. The walls are adorned with floral tapestries and antique mirrors that reflect the flickering light from the fireplace.

Feeling a sense of peace wash over you, you sit down on the bed and run your fingers across the soft silk. As you lay back, the balanced weight of the canopy gently envelops you.

Lastly, you turn your attention to the third door. It leads to a tranquil garden filled with fragrant flowers and blooming trees. A small stream gurgles softly as it winds its way through the flora. You take a deep breath, filling your lungs with the fresh scent of the flowers and the crispness of the air. The sun beats down on your skin, warming it to the touch.

Suddenly, you hear a voice behind you. It's a soft, melodic voice that seems to resonate with your very core. You turn around, and there's an elderly woman standing there. Her eyes twinkle with wisdom and kindness as she smiles at you warmly.

"Welcome," she says. "You've found your way to the place of peace and rest. This is a sanctuary where time stands still, and all your worries and troubles fade away. My name is Flora, and I welcome you with open arms. As long as you're here, let me take care of you."

With those words, the dream begins to fade as you awaken, feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. The memory of the cottage, the garden, and Flora lingers in your mind, leaving you with a sense of calm and contentment.
