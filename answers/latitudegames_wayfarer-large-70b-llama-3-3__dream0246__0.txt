I am dreaming. I am dreaming, vividly caught in the heart of an avalanche, where fragile reality crumbles beneath me. The mountainside groans and trembles ominously. Instability seizes each moment, cracks spreading.

With each step, the once-pristine snow cover splinters and breaks away. The treacherous slope crumbles. Far above, an ominous crack creeps across the summit, threatening to unleash tons of powder at any moment.

My breath comes in quick, shallow gasps, fogging my goggles as I frantically scan the terrain for any sign of safety. But every direction offers only terraced steepness and crumbling ridgelines. The entire mountain appears poised to give way.

Suddenly, a faint rumble echoes through the air - a low vibration that builds to a deafening roar as the snow above releases. White flashes of sunlight glint off the approaching cascade, before tons of powder whiteout the world around me.

I'm swallowed into the suffocating chaos of the avalanche, tumbling endlessly through icy void as the mountain reshapes the landscape. In those suspended moments of free fall, everything slows - the thundering rumble, the stinging snow, reality itself. I float, helpless in a timeless space. Then I slam against something hard and cold, and consciousness slips away into the drift.
