I am dreaming. You find yourself advocating for social justice in a community resistant to change. Facing entrenched opposition to your values, you experience moments of doubt and frustration, unsure if your efforts will make a difference.

One evening, while walking through the eerily quiet streets of the neighborhood you're trying to uplift, you encounter a mysterious figure offering cryptic advice that shifts your perspective.

This figure tells you to look deeper within yourself, suggesting that true change begins with personal transformation. As the dream progresses, you find yourself embodying the kindness, courage, and resilience you hope to inspire in others, forming unexpected alliances and turning opponents into allies.
