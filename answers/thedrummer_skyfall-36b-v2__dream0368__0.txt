I am dreaming. Soaring above the clouds on the wings of a majestic eagle, I look down upon the vast expanse of my life stretching out before me like an intricate tapestry woven with countless threads of experience, memories, dreams, and regrets. The wind rushes over my face, carrying with it the whispers of ancient wisdom and siren songs of temptation that have shaped me into the person I am today.

As I glide effortlessly through the infinite sky, drinking in the breathtaking vistas of verdant forests and shimmering seas, crystal lakes and towering mountains, a profound inner knowing takes root within my very soul. A resounding YES, reverberating through my being, compelling me to simplify, to shed the excess baggage of a complicated life and focus on what truly matters.

I come to a gentle landing in a hidden glade, bathed in dappled sunlight filtering through a cathedral of ancient trees. In the center stands a mirror, its glass as clear and pure as the deepest part of the night sky. And here, I see my reflection, but not as I have always known myself to be. This is my essence, my core, the truest aspect of me.

The useless distractions, possessions, relationships and pursuits that have tied me down, these I let go of with a feather-light shrug. I set them aside to focus on nurturing my core being and become the person I was always meant to fulfill. A beautiful, loving, compassionate and wise creator, a radiant soul. 

With this life-changing clarity, my soul feels both at peace and electrified, like I can finally breathe the sweet air that sustains me. I am remembering on a subconscious level the infinite power I hold within myself to create any life I desire, and I commit myself fully in this moment to embracing the greatest potential within me.

I close my eyes, taking a deep, restorative breath, smiling with surrender and serenity, knowing that all is well and that I am exactly where I am meant to be in this beautiful unfolding mystery we call life. Allegedly, Iâ€™ll be calm and confident as I simplify and discover the greatness that awaits me.
