I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a kaleidoscopic field where flowers bloom with mirrors for petals, each one reflecting a different emotional memory. As I walk through this shimmering garden, I hear echoes of laughter - my own nervous, inappropriate laughter - bouncing off the mirrored surfaces. Each time a painful memory appears in one of the reflections, I automatically burst into uncontrollable giggles, even as tears stream down my face.

The sky above shifts between deep indigo and burnt orange, pulsing like a heartbeat. Shadow figures appear and begin sharing their deepest traumas, and to my horror, I respond with increasingly absurd jokes and puns. I try to clamp my hands over my mouth, but the laughter bubbles up uncontrollably, like carbonated grief.

Suddenly, the mirror-flowers begin to grow taller, stretching upward until they form a maze of reflective walls. In each panel, I see myself at different moments of pain - losses, failures, heartbreaks - and in every scene, I'm laughing inappropriately, using humor as a shield. The maze begins to spin, faster and faster, my defensive laughter echoing and multiplying until it becomes a deafening chorus.

At the center of the maze, I discover a small stage with a spotlight. A microphone stands there, and somehow I know that this is where I must face my pain without the armor of humor. But each time I try to speak honestly about my feelings, they emerge as dark comedy routines. The spotlight grows brighter and more intense, forcing me to confront this pattern of deflecting emotional truth with jokes.

The dream begins to fragment, the mirror-walls shattering into countless glittering pieces, each one carrying a different laugh track. As I float awake, I'm left with the profound realization that my humor, while protective, has become a prison keeping me from genuine emotional expression.

In the final moments before consciousness, I hear a gentle voice whisper: "Sometimes tears and laughter flow from the same well."
