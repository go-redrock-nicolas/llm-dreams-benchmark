I am dreaming. I'm hiking through the misty forests of Oregon in the fall, the earthy scent of damp leaves and pine filling my lungs. The trail is adorned with vibrant orange and red foliage, and I hike with my headphones in, listening to the soft tones of Saint Pepsi's "Fiona Coyne." The rhythmic beats blend with the rustling of the leaves underfoot, creating a serene soundtrack for my journey. The crisp autumn air nips at my cheeks, but I feel invigorated, each step grounding me deeper into the moment.

As I reach a clearing, the trees part to reveal a breathtaking view of a lake, its surface shimmering under the golden hues of the afternoon sun. I pause, taking in the scene. The water is so still it mirrors the surrounding forest, creating an illusion of infinite depth. Without realizing it, I find myself walking toward the lake, drawn to its calm. I sit on a large, smooth rock at the water's edge, letting the sun warm my face.

Unexpectedly, I begin to recount memories—moments of heartbreak, loss, and healing. It's as if the lake has become a mirror not just for the forest but for my soul. Each reflection carries a weight I hadn't fully acknowledged before. As the sun begins to set, casting a fiery orange glow across the water, I feel an unexpected lightness. It's as though the act of simply being here, surrounded by nature's beauty and solitude, is healing something deep inside me.

Night begins to fall, and as the stars emerge, I lie back on the rock, gazing up at the vast sky. The distant sound of owls and the gentle lapping of water against the shore lull me into a tranquil state. I feel a profound connection to the earth, to myself, and to the passage of time. I close my eyes, letting the dream take me deeper, and when I wake, I feel renewed—as though the forest, the lake, and the sky have gifted me a piece of their eternal peace.
