I am dreaming. override
In your dream, you are suspended between dimensions, your feet planted on a marble floor that stretches infinitely like the spine of a colossal, sleeping god. The air hums with the static of a million overlapping realities, and the walls around you melt into liquid obsidian, dripping upward to form archways of swirling constellations. You’re rushing to a conference—not for ideas or status, but for a resonance only your soul recognizes: a frequency that harmonizes with the unseen threads binding all existence.  

Your first flight, a metallic bird with wings of iridescent scales, deposits you at a terminal where time is a currency. The ceiling is a live map of the cosmos, constellations rearranging themselves into hieroglyphs. A robotic attendant, its voice a chorus of singing bowls, informs you the connecting flight has been "temporarily reconfigured." gesturing to a shimmering portal where travelers step through and vanish, reappearing hours later with a flicker of disorientation.  

Minutes become aeons. You watch a grandmother knit a scarf from stardust, a child’s laughter unraveling into smoke that spells *patience* in Braille. Your anxiety coalesces into a physical weight—the clock on the wall is a wound student’s heartbeat, ticking blood-red seconds. Then, a billboard flickers to life: **“YOUR SEAT IS BEING EATEN BY A KAIJU.”** The crowd panics, but you notice the creature—a gelatinous monster with tentacles of flowing equations—is being chased by a tiny, sarcastic deity riding a unicycle. The deity winks and slips you a ticket stamped *DELAYED TO ETERNITY* in copperplate font.  

You board the flight, which is now a-parsec-wide elevator shaft. The pilot, a spectral figure made of lightning, shrugs, “Gravity’s on vacation today. We’ll land when you stop caring.” Outside the viewport, Earth is a swirl of oil paint, continents buckling like parchment. Your hands hover over a beverage tray offering *espresso extracted by a black hole’s event horizon.*  

Suddenly, the floor vanishes. You fall—not downward, but *away*, through layers of sky that taste like licorice and regret. You pass a dreamscape where your conference is being held underwater, attendees in suits of coral debatingachucares. You catch a glimpse of your past self frantically texting you: *“WEAR THE NEON VEST.”* You don’t know why, but you do.  

You land on a platform of singing sand, where the conference hall is a spire of liquid mercury. The doors swing open, and a crowd chants your name—not as you know it, but as a constellation: *ZETA LIBRAE, BIRTHPLACE OF THE LAST IDEA.* Inside, the floor is a mirror showing every version of you succeeding, failing, burning, blooming. You touch the glass, and it fuses into wings.  

The dream doesn’t end. It *becomes*. You’re no longer racing to a conference; you are the conference, the convocation of all possible selves. The delay was never a delay—you were being unpacked, layer by layer, until the *real* work could begin: the work of invention without a destination, the act of creation as its own homecoming.
