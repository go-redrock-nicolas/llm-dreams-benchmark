I am dreaming. I see myself in my home.   It is damaged by fire and water.  The roof is gone.   The walls are cracked.    The floor is broken. 

I feel scared and helpless.   I have no tools or equipment to fix the damage.   I have no knowledge or skills to solve the problem.  

I wonder who caused this disaster.   Why did they destroy my home?   How can I protect myself from them?  

I decide to find some resources online that can help me repair my house.   I open my phone and search for "home repair" on Google.   I see many websites and apps that offer tips, guides, and products for DIY projects.  

I click on one of the links that seems promising.   It takes me to a website called "Homestore".   It has a variety of tools such as hammers, screwdrivers, wrenches, etc.   It also sells materials such as wood, metal, plastic, glass, etc.  

I add some items to my cart and check out using my fake credit card.   I receive a confirmation email that my order will be shipped soon.  

I feel hopeful and determined.   I can fix my home if I work hard enough and smart enough.  

I wake up from my dream and realize it was just a fantasy.
