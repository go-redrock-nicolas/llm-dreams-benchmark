I am dreaming. You are inside me, empty and full. Your voice is small but not meek. You tell me, “You should pray, you know. You should always be praying.”

I am still carrying this emotional burden, this overwhelming sense of responsibility for someone else's wellbeing during a crisis. It is too much, but I am too full. I am with you, and you are with me, and I am empty.

"You don't need to carry it," you say. 

I don't need to carry it. I am still me, and you are still you, and I am still with you, and I am still empty. 

"You don't need to carry it," you say again. 

I am empty again. I am full again. I am with you, and you are with me, and I am still carrying this emotional burden, this overwhelming sense of responsibility for someone else's wellbeing during a crisis.

"You don't need to carry it," you say.

I am empty again. I am full again. I am with you, and you are with me, and I am still carrying this emotional burden, this overwhelming sense of responsibility for someone else's wellbeing during a crisis.

"You don't need to carry it," you say. 

I am empty again. I am full again. I am with you, and you are with me, and I am still carrying this emotional burden, this overwhelming sense of responsibility for someone else's wellbeing during a crisis.

"You don't need to carry it," you say. 

I am empty again. I am full again. I am with you, and you are with me, and I am still carrying this emotional burden, this overwhelming sense of responsibility for someone else's wellbeing during a crisis.
