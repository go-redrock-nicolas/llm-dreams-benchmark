I am dreaming. I am adrift in a labyrinthine metropolis where skyscrapers twist like liquid metal toward a sky that can't decide between twilight and dawn. The streets below me pulse with rivers of humanity, their faces blurred like impressionist paintings caught in the rain. Every sound echoes with strange resonance—footsteps become heartbeats, car horns transform into distant whale songs. I feel myself shrinking against the vastness, my sense of direction scattered like leaves in an autumn wind.

The air smells of ozone, cinnamon, and something undefinable—perhaps the scent of countless human stories intertwining. I turn down an alleyway that seems to breathe, its cobblestones glistening with a light that has no visible source. My shadow stretches and contracts independent of my movements.

Just as panic begins to crystallize in my chest, three figures materialize before me—neither approaching nor appearing, simply becoming present where moments before there was emptiness. One wears a coat made of monarch butterfly wings that somehow remain alive, fluttering occasionally against the twilight air. Another's skin is covered in luminescent script that shifts and changes when I try to read it. The third carries a lantern filled with what looks like captured moonlight.

"You've been walking in circles," says the one with the butterfly coat, their voice harmonizing with itself in impossible chords. "Time doesn't flow straight here."

The figure with the living text extends a hand that leaves trails of phosphorescent light. "We've been waiting for you since before you were lost."

The third smiles and raises their lantern, which casts shadows that move against the flow of light. "Follow us. The city remembers you, even if you've forgotten the way."

As I reach toward them, I feel the boundaries of myself becoming permeable, as if I'm both more and less than human in this moment of connection...
