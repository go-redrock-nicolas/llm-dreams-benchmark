I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the edge of an endless, shimmering meadow under a sky that burns with hues of lavender and molten gold, a sunset that refuses to fade. The air is thick with the scent of wild honey and blooming jasmine, carried on a breeze that hums with whispers of forgotten songs. My bare feet sink into the cool, dewy grass, each blade glistening like spun crystal, reflecting a thousand tiny rainbows that dance with every step I take. I am surrounded by abundance—fruit-laden trees with branches sagging under the weight of ruby-red apples and sun-kissed peaches, rivers of clear, sparkling water weaving through the landscape like silver threads, and hills blanketed with vibrant wildflowers that seem to pulse with life, their petals unfurling as if to greet me. It is a paradise of plenty, a world where every need is met before it is even felt.

Yet, despite this intoxicating wealth of beauty and resource, a gnawing hollow sits heavy in my chest. A sense of scarcity claws at my mind, whispering insidious doubts that none of this is real, that it will vanish the moment I reach for it. I gaze at the overflowing bounty, and my vision warps— the apples turn to ash in my mind’s eye, the rivers dry into cracked, barren earth, and the flowers wilt into gray shadows. My hands tremble as I clutch at the air, desperate to hold onto something, anything, but my fingers close around nothing. I feel poor in spirit, unworthy of this splendor, convinced that I am an intruder in a feast meant for someone else. My heart races with the fear that I will be left with empty hands, starving in a land of endless harvest.

As I stand there, paralyzed by this perceptual distortion, a figure emerges from the horizon, a being woven from light and mist, its form shifting like liquid glass. It glides toward me, its presence both soothing and piercing, as if it can see straight through the veil of my fears. “Why do you see lack where there is overflow?” it asks, its voice a melody of wind chimes and distant thunder, echoing in the chambers of my soul. I try to answer, but my words crumble like dry leaves, and I can only point to the desolate vision my mind has painted over this vibrant reality.

The being extends a hand, and from its palm spills a cascade of golden dust that swirls around me, enveloping me in a warm, tingling embrace. Suddenly, my perspective shifts—I am lifted above the meadow, floating like a feather on an unseen current. From this vantage, I see the true scope of the abundance below, untouched by my distorted lens. The trees are even heavier with fruit, the rivers wider and more radiant, the flowers stretching endlessly into the horizon. But more than that, I feel the energy of it all—a thrumming, living force that flows through every blade of grass, every drop of water, every breath I take. It is as if the meadow is whispering to me, “You are part of this. You are not separate. There is no lack within you.”

Tears stream down my face, not of sorrow but of release, as the scarcity I’ve carried begins to dissolve like mist under the morning sun. I realize that the barrenness I saw was a reflection of my own inner doubts, a mirror of fears I’ve held too close. The being of light nods, as if confirming my revelation, and guides me back to the ground. I kneel in the grass, pressing my palms into the earth, feeling its pulse sync with my own heartbeat. I pick a peach from a nearby tree, its juicy flesh bursting with sweetness as I bite into it, and for the first time in this dream, I truly taste the abundance around me. The rivers sing as they flow, the flowers sway as if in celebration, and the sky seems to glow even brighter, as if acknowledging my shift.

But the dream doesn’t end there. As I revel in this newfound clarity, the meadow begins to transform. The landscape ripples like a canvas being repainted—an invitation to explore deeper. The trees twist into spiraling towers of emerald and amber, the rivers rise into shimmering bridges that arch into the heavens, and the flowers bloom into luminous orbs that float like tiny moons. I understand now that this abundance isn’t static; it evolves with my perception, reflecting the infinite possibilities within me. The sense of scarcity was never about the external world—it was a call to examine the limits I’ve placed on myself, to see how I’ve dimmed my own light.

I walk forward into this ever-changing paradise, no longer afraid of losing what I see, for I know now that abundance isn’t just around me—it is me. The being of light lingers at the edge of my vision, a silent guardian, as I step onto a river-bridge that sparkles like a path of stars. With every step, I feel fuller, richer, not in material gain but in the boundless wealth of spirit and wonder. The dream stretches on, a tapestry of infinite creation, and I am no longer a bystander but a co-creator, weaving my own threads of abundance into this vibrant, endless world.
