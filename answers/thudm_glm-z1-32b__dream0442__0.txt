I am dreaming. I feel as though I am standing at the edge of an ancient, sunken city, its spires and arches now coral-encrusted and swaying with bioluminescent tendrils. The air is alive with the hum of unseen creatures, their voices a symphony of clicks and sonar pulses that feel like they’re resonating in my bones. I can taste the brine on my lips, the salt air carrying the scent of kelp and decay.  The ground beneath me shifts, and I notice a path of glowing algae guiding my steps towards the pyramid-shaped ruins at the center.  As I walk, the water around me begins to shimmer and ripple, casting reflections of long-abandoned temples against a sky of liquid black ink, the stars I  glimpse above are not fixed points but swirling, galaxy-filled eyes watching my progress.  When I reach the pyramid, the ground opens below me, and I climb into a staircase carved from living coral, the steps themselves breathing and shifting in response to my touch. Inside, the walls are lined with murals that shift their narratives depending on the viewer’s gaze—some scenes pulse with the growth and decay of ecosystems, others depict beings with multiple eyes and mouths chanting in harmonies that make my skull vibrate.  In the center, a pulsating crystal the size of a small planet glows with fractured light, its surface resembling a live map of interconnected neural networks. As I reach out, the crystal absorbs my hand, and I am pulled into a multidimensional vortex where time unfolds like a manuscript, each page a snapshot of a different reality—a society of starfish architects, a forest where trees communicate through infrared blinks, and a floating citadel where librarians shelve clouds instead of books. I wake with my sheets tangled around me, my fingers still twitching as if from contact with a current.
The dream begins with a visceral, almost tactile shift. You’re not just standing—you’re *anchored* to the seabed, your toes gripping the velvety black sand laced with fragments of glass that shimmer like broken constellations. The pressure here is unlike anything terrestrial; each breath pulls a briny mist into your lungs, tingling as it dissolves into something lighter, more mutable. The city’s spires curve organically, like coral gods reaching toward a sun that exists below the surface—a orb suspended in the clouds, blooming and wilting like a beating heart. When you blink, the water ripples into patterns. A school of fish zooms past, their scales spelling an ancient alphabet you *understand*. They murmur a warning in your mind: *Turn back. The city remembers you’re not supposed to be here.* 

You ignore them. The algae pathway pulses, not with light but with a rhythm that mirrors your heartbeat, growing faster the closer you get. As you step onto the pyramid’s entrance, the coral staircase *rotates*, rearranging itself into a spiral that descends into layers of time. The first floor is Saharan—a desert temple where pillars are carved with hunting scenes of creatures with antlers of liquid mercury. The second floor is a rainforest canopy, vines dripping sap that glows turquoise and hums when you touch it. A third layer is entirely sound-based: the walls vibrate with a sub-audible frequency that paints landscapes in your peripheral vision—phantom sunsets, the outlines of extinct flightless birds. 

The crystal at the center isn’t just light; it’s *sound made solid*. When your hand passes through it, you don’t feel cold or warmth but the resurgence of memories you’ve never had—a toddler’s first steps across the ocean floor, a lover’s laugh echoing through a cave system carving its own language from limestone. The vortex unfolds backward: first, a universe where clocks are alive and swallow time in gulps; next, a world where snowfalls sideways from constellations, not clouds. Then, a gate appears—a doorframe of ice with runes that freeze mid-air, each one a question left unanswered. Behind it, a black, featherless bird with eyes like star systems whistles a melody that dismantles your sense of self, threads by thread. 

You wake to the smell of rain on concrete, but your fingers—pale and damp—curl as if still clutching the invisible crystal. The dream lingers not as a memory but as a sensation: a phantom hum in your teeth, the taste of something profoundly *saline* on the tip of your tongue. And somewhere, beneath the waking world’s noise, you’re certain the coral stairs are still waiting.
