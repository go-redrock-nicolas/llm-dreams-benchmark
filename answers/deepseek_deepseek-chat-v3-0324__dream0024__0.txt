I am dreaming. The familiar hum of the ceiling fan, the faint scent of morning coffee, and the warmth of my quilt—everything seems as it should be, until I open my eyes and the world has rewritten itself overnight.  

Moonlight bathes my bedroom in an eerie silver glow, though my clock insists it is 7:30 AM. When I reach for my phone, it’s gone. No—not gone. The sleek rectangle still sits on my nightstand, but when I tap the screen, it remains dark. A whisper slips through the open window: *No electricity after sunrise.* No, that can’t be right.  

I stumble out of bed and peer through the blinds. The street is empty. No cars. No flickering porch lights. Instead, the pavement glistens with something wet and unfamiliar, like liquid starlight, and the air smells of burnt sugar and damp earth. A shadow moves in my neighbor’s yard—a figure wrapped in dark fabric, kneeling beside a small fire, murmuring words I don’t recognize.  

Then I see the first sign—a poster nailed to the telephone pole. *SPEAKING ABOVE A WHISPER IS PROHIBITED. EYE CONTACT IS ILLEGAL. SHOES MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE ENTERING ANY BUILDING.* The letters pulse like they’re alive.  

My heartbeat stutters. The rules have changed. I don’t know how or why, but I know—with a certainty deeper than bone—that breaking them will have consequences I don’t want to face.  

A sound behind me makes me whirl around. My reflection in the mirror grins, sharp and knowing, and mouths words I can’t hear. When I press my palm to the glass, it doesn’t feel cold. It feels warm. Hungry.  

Outside, the whispering grows louder.  

The dream is just beginning.  

What do I do?
