I am dreaming. I am in a dream: the world around me is blurred at the edges, as if reality is a watercolor left out in the rain. Golden evening light dapples across my skin, and the sky above is a shifting prism of indigo, lapis, and amethyst. I wear a suit that shimmers with each step—never quite the same color twice—and yet my heart stutters with dread, for tonight is the night of the Gathering.

Anticipatory anxiety breathes on the back of my neck, cold and featherlight. I float through a landscape halfway between memory and fantasy, a street I’ve walked a thousand times but where lamplight glows with the warmth of candle flames and flowers bloom fantastical shapes in window boxes. The doors to the hall stand before me—tall, veined with silver, their handles twisting into dragon’s heads.

I pause at the threshold, invisible weight pressing on my chest. Despite coming here before, I know what follows: clamoring voices, eyes that linger too long, the exhausting dance of words and smiles, the sense that everyone else is speaking a language I only half remember. Why does my mind draw shadow monsters from these anticipations?

I look inward, and suddenly I am falling—diving deep through the layers of my own mind, plunging past the ticking of the social clock, past the roots of old embarrassments tangled around memories of laughter. Here, the deeper part of my imagination unveils: a cavernous ballroom lit by floating lanterns that pulse like fireflies. The faces of the other guests are those of old friends, kind strangers, the self I wish to be—a host of benevolent masks.

I realize my anxiety isn’t about the event itself, but about the pressures I heap upon it: the desire to be accepted, to sparkle, to glide effortlessly between conversations. It is fear of being seen, and not being enough—yet, in this space beneath my wakeful thoughts, I am both crowd and companion, anxious guest and gracious host.

A small, luminous owl alights on my shoulder, whispering, “You are more welcome than you know.” The doors swing wide, music trickles out: clear notes like dewdrops on grass. Taking a breath scented with vanilla and hope, I step forward. My feet barely touch the ground—each stride lighter, as my anxiety softens under the radiant glow of self-compassion.

Within this midnight dreamscape, I enter the social gathering not as a stranger, but as myself, whole and unafraid. My anticipation transforms, not into dread, but into wonder—ready to greet the world beyond the silver doors.
