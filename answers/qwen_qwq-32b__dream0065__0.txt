I am dreaming. The air feels thick, heavy, like a veil has been draped over everything. I'm in a forest, but not one I recognize. The trees are ancient, their bark cracked and gnarled, reaching up like skeletal fingers. Their leaves shimmer with an otherworldly glowâ€”pale blue and violet, casting an eerie, ethereal light. The ground beneath my feet is soft, almost-like, and every step sends ripples of faint, bioluminescent fungi pulsating into the soil, like the heartbeat of the earth itself.
