I am dreaming.

I find myself on the silver shore of a midnight sea, where the tide glows faintly—as though moon-dust has dissolved into the water. Each wave brings not a crash, but a hush: a whispered invitation to listen. Clutched in my right hand is a jagged piece of glass, the shard from an old mirror I once smashed in anger. Its edge has long since dulled, yet I still grip it so tightly that my knuckles burn. The shard is cold, almost shy; it wants to be set down, but I have carried it for so many years that my palm has molded around its crooked shape.

A small boat fashioned of translucent pearl waits at the shoreline. Its mast is a white silk ribbon, fluttering like the breath of forgiveness itself. I step in, and the vessel glides forward, as if it knows exactly where my heart needs to go. The ocean smells of lavender smoke; every inhale reminds me of evenings long ago, before the injury, before resentment coiled around my ribs.

Soon the sea yields to a narrow river whose banks are lined with memory-trees. Their bark is etched with scenes from my past—birthday candles snuffed too soon, embraces refused, apologies never voiced. Fireflies flicker inside each carved vignette, illuminating details I once glossed over. The boat slows beside a tree split by lightning: the night I was injured. I see myself, wounded and furious, vowing never to forget, never to forgive. A knot swells in my throat—the pain is still here, pulsing like the distant cry of a loon.

A gentle hand touches my shoulder. I turn to find a younger version of myself, no older than seven, wearing a shirt speckled with watercolor stars. Their eyes carry neither judgment nor pity—only patient wonder. They extend both palms. Without words, they ask for the glass shard.

I hesitate. If I surrender it, will I lose the sense of justice I’ve wrapped around it? But the child smiles and the river stills; even the crickets fall silent, awaiting my choice. Slowly, I place the shard in their hands. Instantly it melts into liquid starlight, dripping through their fingers into the river, where it becomes a ribbon of shimmering fish darting downstream.

A soft breeze rustles the banks, transforming the lightning-split tree. The sundered trunk knits itself together, bark smoothing into fresh whorls. New leaves unfurl—young, luminous green—each one carrying a word: Release. Heal. Trust.

The boat glides onward until the river widens into a crystalline lagoon. Here the air tastes like rain before it falls. The younger me steps onto the shore and beckons. Together we plant our feet in warm sand. Overhead, constellations rearrange themselves into the outline of an unbroken circle—no beginnings, no ends.

The child whispers, “The wound shaped you, but it doesn’t have to steer you.” Their voice is my own, softened by time. When I inhale, the burden that once clenched my chest unknots; when I exhale, I scent lilac and ocean salt—the subtle flavors of possibility.

We close our eyes and bow, honoring the bruise without inviting it to rule. The lagoon’s water rises, not to drown but to cradle. It lifts us, two selves blending, until we stand as one on the mirrored surface. My reflection no longer fractures. It blazes whole beneath the moon.

With a final breath, I forgive—my injurer, the moment, and above all myself. The world responds with a slow, crystalline chime, like wind bells heard from the other side of dawn.

I awaken, my hand empty, my palm finally free to reach for what comes next.
