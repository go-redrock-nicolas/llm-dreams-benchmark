I am dreaming. I am lying in bed, my eyes fluttering as I drift between reality and the unknown. The room is bathed in a soft, indigo glow, the digital clock's numerals flickering 3:47 AM. Outside, a symphony of crickets hums a lullaby that pulls me deeper into the dreamscapescape.

The first scene unfolds in a crystalline valley, where jagged quartz peaks pierce the violet sky. The air tastes of honey and ozone. I stepped towards a glimmering stream, my bare feet sinking into the gravelly bed. As I dip my fingers, ripples like liquid mercury spread outward, revealing my reflection: not my own face, but a mask of obsidian, cracks spiderwebbing across its surface. The mask whispers, "You've outgrown your yesterdayself." I watch as the cracks begin to heal, glinting with silver. The stream parts, a bridge of willow branches arches above it, leading to a castle made entirely of interlocking gears. The gears turn in perfect synchrony, their teeth clicking like castanets<continuewritingthestory>
The castle’s doors, wrought from bronze napkin rings fused into a spiraling ouroboros, groan open at my touch.Inside, the air thrums with the electric scent of struck flint, and the walls pulse like a heartbeat—gears the size of dinner plates spin in hidden grooves, their edges shearing thin shafts of light into rainbows that pool across the stone floor. I step over a moat of liquid mercury, my reflection warping into a dozen fractured selves, each version of me shouting headlines from the past: *FAILURE*, *ABANDONED*, *WORTHLESS*. But the obsidian mask glints silver on my face now, its fractals repaired, and when a shadowy voice hisses, “Turn back,” I trace its surface. My touch unravels the; the whispers dissolve into the language of lullabies.

A stairwell coils upward, its steps made of sand that slips beneath my boots like a desert dreaming. At the summit, I find a hall of mirrors, their surfaces fogged with paradox. One reflects a toddler clinging to a mother’s skirt, another a college graduate clutching a degree like a talisman, a third an empty office where rain sloshes through a shattered window. But between them looms a throne of clockwork ivy, inhabited by a figure with the body of a raven and the head of an hourglass. Its voice is the ticking of a thousand wristwatches. “You survived,” it crows, “but did you *choose* to live?”

I don’t answer. Instead, I pluck a gear from the throne’s stem—a sun-and-moon hybrid, carved with sigils that burn like embers. The raven-hourglass shrieks, and the castle begins to unravel. The walls melt into oil paintings, the stairs collapse into dandelion fluff, and the mercury moat surges skyward, joining other rivers I don’t recognize: one silver, one black as ink, one blue with stars. They coil into a vortex above me, and as I step into it, I feel the old wound—the setback that once split my world in two—begin to scar over, not with silence, but with the cacophony of a thousand songs sung at once. The mask slips from my face, and in its place is a constellation no one can name. 

When I wake, the sun is bleeding through the curtains at 5:17 AM, but the taste of honeyed ozone lingers on my tongue. The setback? It’s still there, a scar on my psyche, but now I carry it like a locket: heavy, yes, but proof that even collapsing structures can birth wings.
