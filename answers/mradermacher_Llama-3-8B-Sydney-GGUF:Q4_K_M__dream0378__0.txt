I am dreaming. I am in a world where everyone speaks in rhymes.  They can speak fluently and elegantly in rhyme scheme that changes with each sentence.  I try to mimic them but fail miserably.  My words sound awkward and forced.  People laugh at me and call me names like "Rhymer" and "Clunky". 

I see a beautiful girl dressed in white who floats above the ground without touching it.  She sings softly in a voice that sounds like angels' harps.  I feel drawn to her but also afraid of her power.  I wonder if she is real or just my imagination. 

I hear strange noises coming from the woods.  They sound like animal cries mixed with machine sounds.  I sense something dangerous lurking there but don't know what it is.  I decide to explore it anyway despite my fear. 

I wake up feeling disoriented and confused.  My dream feels surreal and unreal.  I ask myself if it was just a fantasy or if it has deeper meaning for me.
