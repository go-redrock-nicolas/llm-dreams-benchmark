I am dreaming. The world around me shimmers like oil on water, each breath stirring currents of color that slide and swirl beneath my skin. I stand at the lip of a vast, starlit ocean whose waves glimmer in impossible hues—emerald ripples that pulse to a silent rhythm, sapphire curls that curl and glow as if lit from within. Every crest and trough hums with a gentle, resonant energy, as though the sea itself were breathing.

I step forward, toes sinking into the sand that feels neither hot nor cold but alive—tiny motes of light dancing between my toes, lifting like fireflies before drifting skyward. Above me, the sky is not a sky but a canvas of liquid gold and violet, streaked with comet-trails of turquoise and rose. Stars pulse and blink in rapid conversation, whispering tales older than time itself.

As I advance along the shore, I catch sight of a cluster of floating lanterns drifting just above the water’s surface. Each lantern bears a single, perfect rose suspended inside—petals of spun glass that glow with an inner warmth. I reach out and one lantern dips gently toward my palm. The rose’s petals transform in my fingers into quivering motes of memory: laughter from childhood, a first breath of spring’s fragrance, the hush of library halls where secrets sleep between pages.

Suddenly the ocean’s surface ripples upward like a slow, aqueous curtain, revealing beneath it a forest of crystalline trees. Their branches tinkle like wind chimes, each leaf a translucent prism refracting the light. I step among them, and as I pass, the trees lean in, curious. Their voices are soft—a chorus of sighs that weave together into a lullaby of revelation. I feel ideas unfurling in my mind, vast tapestries of sound and shape and feeling coalescing into new worlds I’ve never known.

Time unravels here. Minutes stretch into lifetimes, then contract to a heartbeat. Every idea that surfaces is a star born, igniting constellations of possibility. I close my eyes and let the cosmic lullaby cradle me, knowing that in this dreamscape of living color and whispering light, creation itself flows through me without effort or end.
