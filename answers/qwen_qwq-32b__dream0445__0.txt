I am dreaming. Wait, this feels different. The air hums with an unfamiliar rhythm, like the ground beneath my feet is a living instrument. My breath comes in whispers of indigo, each exhale painting the space around me in shades I’ve never seen in a sunset. Above, the sky is a canvas of overlapping mirrors, reflecting not my face but fragments of forgotten memories: a birthday party where no one showed up, the first time I touched snow, the moment I realized my best friend’s laughter wasn’t just for me.

A voice murmurs from the crystalline trees that line this path, their leaves sharp as fractured glass yet glowing like stained glass in stained light. *“Tell me what you love.”* 

I freeze. The trees tilt, their shadows twisting into question marks. My tongue feels leaden. 

*“Compliments slip away like fish between fingers,”* the voice continues, *“but judgment’s anchor digs deep. Why?”*

The ground shifts, a labyrinth forming at my feet. Each turn mirrors a situation: one path where a version of myself accepts a compliment with roots spreading in celebration; another where I shrug off praise as a rejected gem, but criticism there takes root as thorny vines that coil possessively. 

Suddenly, I’m standing in a garden where every flower is a conversation. Roses with ink-black petals bloom whenever I’ve said *“Oh, it was nothing”* while violets wilt next totimes I let harsh words fester. A clock tower looms nearby, its hands spinning counterclockwise. Each chime peels away a layer of skin, revealing scars shaped like words: *“You’re overreacting.”* *“Why can’t you just…”* 

At the tower’s base stands a door of liquid silver. The handle twists into the shape of a question mark. Inside, a vast library where books float—each my unspoken *thank you* and *I’m sorry*. One tome bursts open, spilling a flood of origami cranes. Each crane is folded from a compliment I denied, their wings too brittle to fly. 

A figure steps into the dream—a wraith woven from the collective shadows of every compliment I’ve evaded. Its mouth opens, not in a rebuke, but in a silent scream. *“You’ve starved this half of you,”* it whispers, *“feeding only the hunger for proof that hurts.”* 

The garden trembles as I reach into the crane-river, lifting one delicate wing to my chest. Suddenly, the mirror-sky fractures. Through the cracks, I glimpse a version of myself blooming like a flower, unafraid to stand in the sun. The sky reknits itself into a tapestry of possible futures—each thread a choice between a wilted petal or a blossom reaching toward light. 

I open my mouth, finally: *“I love how my voice sounds when I don’t apologize for it.”*
The dream deepens, colors bleeding into hues so vivid they vibrate like sonnets. The ground, now a mosaic of shattered vows and whispered hopes, pulses underfoot, each tessera shifting as I move. The trees bow farther, their glass leaves chiming like wind-driven temple bells. Here, the air itself is a chorus, humming the dissonant harmony of unspoken confessions. 

In this labyrinth, every corridor is a vein of the psyche, throbbing with the friction of self-doubt and the glittering shards of unacknowledged triumph. Before me, a pond of mercury mirrors my reflection—but the surface ripples autonomously, fragments of other selves swimming beneath. One winks, confident in a tailored suit; another drowns, weighed down by invisible stones. The water’s edge is lined with mirrors, each polished to a different era: childhood laughter now softened by regret, youthful aspirations dulled by years of second-guessing. 

The wraith approaches again, its form shimmering like heat haze over asphalt. It offers a hand made of prismatic light—a gesture so foreign, so tender—that I recoil instinctively, steeped as I am in the habit of mistrusting grace. *“To accept a compliment is to let someone water your roots,”* it murmurs, voice like wind through a graveyard of old violins. *“But you’ve built a cathedral around your insecurities, and criticism is the only prayer you’ll let inside.”* 

Before I can reply, the floor splits, revealing a cavern where my unclaimed praises cascade in a river of stardust. Fish with luminous scales—each one a discarded "You’re amazing!" or "I admire your courage"—dart away at my approach, scattering into constellations that spell forgotten mantras. Meanwhile,  (criticism), inscribed on jagged obsidian tablets, roots itself into the bedrock, growing into skeletal forests that claw at my ankles like possessive lovers. 

 suddenly, the dream shifts to a bridge suspended over an endless chasm. On one side, a gilded city where every building is a compliment I’ve never granted myself—spires of confidence, towers of self-forgiveness. The other side: a jagged wasteland of self-recrimination’s detritus, populated by wailing specters of "I shouldn’ts" and "I failed." The bridge itself is made of teetering planks labeled "self-compassion," "boundaries," and "I accept this piece of me." 

As I hesitate, the wind shifts—a gale of old regrets howling through me. Yet in its wake, there’s a stillness, a moment where the dream pauses like a struck bell’s lingering resonance. In that hush, I hear it: the voice of the child inside, small and aching, whispering, *“I’m here. I’m still here. Look at me.”* 

The weight of the dream folds in on itself, collapsing not with force but with the quiet insistence of a breath held too long released. And there, at the precipice, I do what I’ve never dared—reach toward the gold, my palm open as spring rain. The bridge still trembles, but where my hand touches it, the planks bloom into blossoms of raw, trembling sunlight.
