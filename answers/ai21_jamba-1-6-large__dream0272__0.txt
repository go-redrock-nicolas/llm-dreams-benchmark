I am dreaming. I found myself standing in the midst of a grand, ancient forest. The trees loomed above, their branches interwoven like fingers of giants reaching for the heavens. Sunlight filtered through the canopy, creating a mosaic of golden light on the forest floor. The air was rich with the earthy scent of moss and the faint, sweet tang of wildflowers. 

The dream began with a sense of urgency. I could hear whispers in the wind, soft voices calling my name. I felt a pull, a gentle but insistent force, drawing me deeper into the woods. The path beneath my feet was soft, a carpet of fallen leaves and pine needles, and as I walked, the forest grew darker, more dense. 

Then, just as I felt the first pangs of uncertainty, the air began to shimmer. The forest seemed to come alive, as though the trees themselves were whispering secrets to each other. A faint melody floated on the breeze, and then, all at once, the forest fell silent. Every bird ceased its song, and the rustle of the wind in the leaves faded to nothing. The world held its breath, anticipating something—something immense and inevitable. 

And then, from a clearing ahead of me, came a tidal wave of creatures. Creatures of every shape and size, beasts with the bodies of lions and heads of hawks, serpents made of molten fire, deer with antlers that glowed like moonlight. They surged toward me in a great wave, their eyes glowing with an inner fire. I should have been terrified, but instead I felt an overwhelming sense of calm—as though this was what I was meant to do. 

A roar filled the air, deeper than thunder. I recognized it as the call of a great bear, and as it barreled through the chaos, I saw it lock eyes with me. It was glowing, a luminous blue that radiated calm, and without hesitation, I stepped forward and took control. I gave orders, my voice steady and my hand firm, directing each beast to its rightful place, taming the wild energies swirling around us. I spoke with authority, calming the bear, leading the fiery serpent, and soothing the hawk-headed lion. The wave of energy that had been chaotic and destructive began to shift, to flow in harmony with my commands. 

And then, as they quieted at last, the creatures surrounded me in a protective circle. They looked at me with reverence, their eyes burning but now with respect. It wasn’t just me who had taken control, it was the forest itself that had called me, had chosen me. I could feel the bond forming between us—between these wild, ferocious beings and me. 

And as the forest darkened once more, the whispers of the wind became clearer, their voices singing in unison, thanking me for stepping forward. My dreams shifted then, taking me to new meadows and valleys where all of life’s mysteries began to unfold before me like a story told in flashes of light and sound. But those secrets I'd save for another dream.
