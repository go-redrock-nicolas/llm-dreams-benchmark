The other side reacts by sending their strongest warrior: a goddess who wields lightning bolts in her hand, which she uses to burn away any resistance she faces. 

Both sides want you to choose them as your allies; they threaten to destroy each other if you donâ€™t make a decision soon. What should you do?
