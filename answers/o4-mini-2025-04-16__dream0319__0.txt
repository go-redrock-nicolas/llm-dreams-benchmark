I am dreaming. You drift in a velvet void, where the air hums with phosphorescent motes that drift like lazy fireflies. Beneath your feet shimmers a translucent pathway of shifting colors—emerald, amethyst, molten gold—each hue pulsing in time with your heartbeat. In front of you stands a figure cloaked in silvery mist, its face hidden, yet you sense a kindly wisdom behind the veil. It holds out a compass carved from moonstone, its needle spinning wildly, refusing any single direction.  

A voice, neither male nor female, ripples through the air like wind over distant dunes: “An expedition awaits—across a landscape uncharted and ever-changing. Will you come?”  

You lift the moonstone compass, feeling its cool weight settle in your palm. As you turn it over, you catch a glimpse of moving scenes within its facets:  
 • Towering spires of ice that drip like candle wax into a sea of stars  
 • A forest of glass trees whose branches tinkle like chimes whenever a breeze passes  
 • Vast dunes of obsidian sand that shift to form new constellations beneath your feet  

The ground beneath you trembles. The lantern-bright mote-lights swirl together, weaving into a portal of liquid sapphire. You taste starlight on your tongue—sweet, metallic, impossibly ancient. Every fiber of your being hums with anticipation and a whisper of fear.  

Your heart pounds as the cloaked guide steps aside. The path unfurls like a ribbon of sky. In the distance, you glimpse the silhouette of a vessel built from woven vines and dragon-scale feathers, anchored at the edge of that ever-shifting sea of stars. Above it, the horizon bends, bridging sky and water in a rainbow arc that defies physics.  

Contemplating this adventure into the unknown, you feel a surge of exhilaration as your hand tightens around the compass. The unknown calls to you like a long-lost song, promising wonders you can barely imagine—and challenges that will test every ounce of your courage and creativity.  

With one last steadying breath, you step forward onto the vessel’s deck. Instantly, the dreamscape shudders and reshapes itself: the lantern motes whirl into constellations overhead, the sea below ripples with living light, and the crew—shadows that flicker between animal and human form—gives you an answering nod. The portal closes behind you in a soft sigh, and you are off, hurtling toward lands where reality bends and imagination reigns supreme.
