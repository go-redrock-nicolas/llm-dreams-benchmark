I am dreaming. I am in a world where my dreams can come true.  I see myself walking down a path that leads to an ancient temple.  The air is fragrant with the scent of flowers and incense.  The sunlight filters through the trees and creates a magical atmosphere.  Ahead, I see a group of people dressed in colorful costumes and carrying exotic instruments.  They are celebrating a festival that honors the gods and goddesses who watch over them. 
As I approach them, they welcome me with open arms and warm smiles.  "Come join us," they say. "Let's dance and sing together."  I follow them into the temple where they perform sacred rites that please the deities who bestow upon them great blessings such as health, prosperity, love etc.
Inside, I find a place where my soul can rest and rejuvenate.  Here, I connect with my true self —the one who has been hidden beneath layers of social expectations and cultural constraints.    Here, I discover what really matters to me—my values, beliefs, aspirations etc.
Here, I meet someone who changes everything for me—a man or woman whose eyes sparkle with intelligence, curiosity, passion etc.  We talk about life, death, love, hate etc.  We argue, joke, laugh, cry etc.  We fall in love
