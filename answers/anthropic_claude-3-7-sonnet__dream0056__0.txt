I am dreaming. I suddenly find myself leading a group of strangers through a challenging wilderness expedition. Despite having no previous experience, I somehow know exactly which path to take through the dense forest that surrounds us. The trees tower impossibly high, their canopies merging into a cathedral ceiling of emerald and jade through which dappled sunlight filters in shifting patterns. The air smells of pine resin and damp earth, with occasional wafts of something sweeter—like cinnamon or amber—that seems to guide us forward.

My companions are a curious assortment: a silver-haired woman whose eyes change color with the light; a young man carrying an ancient leather-bound book that occasionally whispers; twin children who finish each other's sentences and sometimes speak in perfect unison; and a tall figure in a hooded cloak who leaves no footprints in the soft soil beneath our feet.

We're searching for something, though I can't quite remember what. The knowledge sits at the edge of my consciousness like a half-remembered melody. Each time we crest a hill or round a bend in our meandering path, I feel a surge of anticipation that quickly fades when what we seek isn't there.

The forest gradually gives way to a landscape impossible in waking life—floating islands of earth suspended above a misty valley, connected by bridges woven from roots and vines that strengthen when we place our trust in them. In the distance, a structure pulses with soft blue light, both inviting and warning us away simultaneously. I know, with dream-logic certainty, that our destination lies within that pulsing glow.

As we approach, time begins to behave strangely. Moments stretch into eternities, then compress into instants. My companions' faces blur and reform, sometimes revealing aspects of people I know from my waking life, sometimes transforming into creatures both beautiful and unsettling.

The blue light envelops us now, and I feel myself simultaneously falling and ascending, as if gravity itself has surrendered its claim on my body. Words in an unfamiliar language appear before my eyes, somehow perfectly comprehensible despite their foreignness, revealing secrets about the universe and my place within it...
