I am dreaming. I find myself in a beautiful and exotic tropical forest filled with colorful flowers, birds and animals.  I see a large
lake with crystal clear water reflecting the sky above.  I hear the sound of running water, tweeting birds and chirping animals.
I smell the fragrance of fresh air, wild flowers and damp soil.

I feel curious, adventurous and free as I start exploring this amazing place.  I walk along the winding path that leads me closer to
the lake.  I see a group of monkeys playing and jumping from tree to tree.  I hear them laughing and screaming with joy.
I smell the scent of their fur and the leaves they eat.

I feel excited, happy and alive as I approach the edge of the lake.  I see a small boat floating on the water.  I hear the gentle
lapping of waves against the boat's hull.
I smell the aroma of wood and leather from the boat's construction.

I feel adventurous, daring and bold as I climb into the boat.  I see a few simple tools such as oars and paddle attached to it.
I hear my heartbeat accelerating with each stroke I make towards open water.

I feel curious, inquisitive and eager as I begin sailing across this vast lake.  I see distant islands covered by lush green
vegetation.  I hear the sound of birds calling out to one another.
I smell the scent of earth and growth from these unexplored territories.

I feel free, independent and empowered as I navigate my way around these unfamiliar shores.  I see caves carved into rocky cliffs.
I hear the echo of my voice resonating within their dark depths.
I smell the aroma of minerals and water from underground springs.

I feel challenged, inspired and creative as I discover new things about myself and this world I'm dreaming up.  I see structures made
of stone and wood that resemble ancient temples or tombs.  I hear the sound of mystery and uncertainty haunting them.
I smell the scent of decay and life from decomposing matter and living organisms.

I feel satisfied, contented and fulfilled as I return to where I started - the tropical forest at the edge of the lake - except now
everything has changed because now I know who I am
