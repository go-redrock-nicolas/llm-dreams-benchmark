I am dreaming. I find myself in a bustling city, filled with people moving along the busy streets. It's raining, but the sound of the rain is soothing, washing away any worries that seemed to linger around me. As I traverse through the crowds, I feel a sense of disorientation and fear creeping up on me.

I look around and realize that everything seems different. The buildings tower above me, reaching up towards the dark and stormy sky. Once familiar landmarks have vanished, replaced by towering skyscrapers that seem to pierce the clouds.

My stomach churns with anxiety as I frantically search for someone to guide me through this unfamiliar landscape. I know I need help, but there's no one around who seems to be paying attention to me.

Suddenly, a figure appears before me. They're tall and imposing, dressed in a black trenchcoat that seems to blend in with the night. Their face is hidden under the hood, but I can feel their eyes boring into my soul.

"Who are you?" I stammer, my voice cracking under the weight of my fear.

The figure steps closer, their boots making a dull thud against the wet pavement. They reach out towards me, their hand extended. I hesitate for a moment, wondering if I should trust this stranger.

"You seek guidance, child?" they ask, their voice deep and resonant.

I nod my head, tears streaming down my cheeks.

"Then let me show you the way." They reach out again, this time offering a handkerchief for me to wipe away my tears. Gratefully, I take it and dab at my face.

I follow the stranger through the crowded streets, my heart pounding against my chest. People move out of their way as we pass, their eyes fixed on the hooded figure. I feel a strange sense of power and Importance, being led by this all-knowing being.

We arrive at a large, imposing building. The stranger presses a button on the intercom and speaks into it. The heavy doors of the building slide open, revealing a luxurious interior. We step inside, and the doors close behind us.

The building is filled with opulence, marble floors and intricate gold detailing. I look up, mesmerized by the chandeliers that light up the grand hallway. I have never seen anything like this in my life.

The stranger leads me down a long corridor, the sound of our footsteps echoing off the polished walls. We stop in front of a massive oak door, adorned with gold door knockers shaped like lions' heads.

The stranger places their hand on the door, and it swings open, revealing a grand room filled with books. A tall, elderly man stands behind an ornate desk, his eyes twinkling with curiosity.

"Ah, welcome, my child," he says, his voice warm and inviting. "I've been expecting you."

I gasp, suddenly realizing where I am. This is the library of my dreams, a place where knowledge and wisdom are cherished.

"This is where you belong," says the hooded figure, removing their hood to reveal their face - it's me, my older self. "You have always found solace and guidance within these pages. Follow your heart, my younger self, for it is your destiny to seek answers within."

I awake with a start, my heart racing. The dream lingers in my mind, a reminder of the importance of self-discovery and following one's inner voice.
