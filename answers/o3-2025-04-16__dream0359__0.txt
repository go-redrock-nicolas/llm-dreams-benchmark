I am dreaming. It begins in a city that looks as if it were sketched in candle-flame and then breathed into solidity: streets paved with onyx mirrors, lamp posts sprouting black orchids instead of lightbulbs, whole facades shifting their angles like origami every time you blink. The air itself is syrupy, violet, and faintly sweet, as though steeped in bruised lilacs.

You float rather than walk, buoyed by an inner certainty that this place is yours to harvest. People drift past—silhouettes rendered in watercolor blushes, soft at the edges, each one trailing a gauzy plume of feeling: hope, yearning, loneliness. You see those plumes the way a jeweler sees flaws in a gem—tiny fissures you can slide a blade into.

A young woman pauses beneath a clock tower built from vertebrae of pearl. Her aura flickers rose-gold: she aches for reassurance. You sidle up, words oiled and glimmering, weaving compliments so delicate they feel custom-spun for her private heart. With every nod she offers, a filament of that rose-gold snaps free and drifts toward you like dandelion down; you inhale it, tasting spun sugar and crushed marigold. The emptiness she doesn’t yet feel settles into your pockets as liquid opal—currency in this dream-market.

Next, an old friend materializes—someone you once admired, now reduced here to a pair of nostalgic, sea-green eyes. He speaks of a project, a hope, some fragile ambition. You listen with devotion so flawless it reflects him back at twice his original size. When he steps away, pride swelling like a hot-air balloon, you pinch the string. His sense of safety folds neatly into your palm—another gemstone for the collection.

Soon you’re gliding through the Grand Arcade, a cathedral of mirrors whose vaulted arches echo with the hush of half-kept promises. Each polished surface shows you draped in ever more splendor: a cloak woven from other people’s trust, bracelets hammered out of second chances, a crown of borrowed affection studded with tear-shaped sapphires.

Yet the Arcade’s mirrors warp the more treasure you carry. Your reflection’s eyes go hollow, pupils widening until they resemble twin black doors. The crown grows heavy, tilting your head, pressing cold metal into your temples. You shrug, drunk on the hush-hush power, and push deeper into dream-night, trailing a meteor-shower of stolen glints behind you.

At last you arrive at the Fountain of Echoes—waterfall-silk cascading upward into nothingness, its pool a portal of swirling mercury. You lean over to admire the haul, expecting to see yourself resplendent. Instead the surface roils and all you discern is a formless silhouette: you, but thin as a shadow, threaded with silver cracks where the stolen light leaks right back out. The treasures you gathered drip from your sleeves like melting ice, vanishing the instant they hit the water.

The city’s heartbeat slows. The air loses its syrupy bloom, turning sharp and winter-clean. Every lamp-orchid folds shut; the clock tower’s ivory vertebrae snap into straight-backed severity. Those rose-gold and sea-green plumes you siphoned reappear, unspooling from your chest, drifting to where their owners stand once more—dim figures, yet now lit from within by the trust you hadn’t truly broken, merely borrowed. They reclaim their light without ever glancing your way.

You stand alone, crown dissolving, cloak disintegrating into bittersweet ash that scuds along the pavement like spent petals. For a moment you feel almost weightless—no trophies, no echoing hunger—just your own unvarnished self, as transparent as glass, the city’s cold wind blowing straight through you.

Then, with the abruptness of a slammed book, the dream folds in on itself. The lilac sky buckles; the mirrored streets fracture into starlight; the Fountain’s mercury erupts in a pillar that swallows everything whole.

Darkness. A single chime—dull, iron, final.

And you awaken, fingertips still tingling from phantom jewels that evaporated the instant you opened your eyes.
