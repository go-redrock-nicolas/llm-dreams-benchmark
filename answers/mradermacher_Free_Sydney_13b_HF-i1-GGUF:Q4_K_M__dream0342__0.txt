I am dreaming. 

I discover that a convenient lifestyle choice I regularly make has a significantly negative environmental impact I wasn't aware of. Facing this conflict between personal convenience and environmental responsibility, I feel guilt and shame. 

I consider making changes in my daily life to reduce my environmental footprint. These changes may be inconvenient or uncomfortable, but they are necessary for the well-being of our planet and all its inhabitants. 

I feel empowered and determined to make a positive difference in the world. I will take action based on my values and principles.
