I am dreaming.

The very fabric of reality fractures—shards of routine and certainty splinter into drifting, luminescent fragments. The world blurs at the edges, and I am swept off my feet by a swirling, invisible current. In an instant, I land in a city built entirely of glass and shadow, each towering structure glinting under clouds that shimmer with iridescent colors I've never seen before.

My feet make no sound upon the walkway, yet a thousand echoes swirl around me, whispering names I almost recognize—forgotten friends, imaginary places, half-remembered memories from childhood. The air tastes of petrichor and cinnamon. I cannot tell if it is day or night; brilliant constellations spiral lazily above, and the sun itself drips golden threads down the sides of skyscrapers that stretch endlessly upwards.

My pockets teem with unfamiliar objects: a compass with a needle that spins in figure eights, a tiny book whose pages glow when I close my eyes, and a brass key that grows heavier the longer I grip it. 

Everything pulses with an electric sense of imminent transformation. I reach for a familiar phone, yet it melts like wax in my palm; my shadow dances without me, skipping across the mirrored streets. Strangers with faces like collages—half wolf, half willow tree, half laugh—approach and press cryptic maps into my hands, each map leading somewhere different, each somewhere promising things unimaginable.

I struggle for direction, but soon realize that adaptation is the only way forward. I let go. I step onto a floating staircase made of origami cranes, each one unfolding beneath my feet and fluttering away the moment I touch it. Every breath becomes a page from an unwritten story; every choice forks the world around me into dazzling new forms—forests made of music, cafes where people trade secrets for dreams, stairwells that spiral up through kaleidoscopic houses of memory.

For a moment, panic flickers, but curiosity ignites brighter. I am learning to walk in this ever-shifting world by trusting in the strangeness, letting awe lead me. The barriers between self and possibility dissolve—here, amid this vivid chaos, I become someone new, unbound by routine or fear, surfing the tides of transformation. I am dreaming, and everything trembles on the edge of becoming.
