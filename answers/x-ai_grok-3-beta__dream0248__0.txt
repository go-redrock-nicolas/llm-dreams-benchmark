I am dreaming. As I wander through the surreal landscape of my dream, I find myself in a twilight realm where the sky is a deep indigo, streaked with veins of molten gold that seem to pulse like arteries of light. The ground beneath my feet is not solid but a shimmering, liquid mirror, reflecting not my image but fleeting glimpses of forgotten memories—faces of people I’ve never met, places I’ve never been. The air hums with a low, haunting melody, as though the wind itself is mourning something lost.

Ahead, I see a figure crouched near the edge of this reflective expanse. Their form is shrouded in a tattered cloak woven from shadows, and their shoulders tremble with silent sobs. As I draw closer, I can hear the raw, ragged sound of their weeping, a sound that tears through the stillness like a jagged blade. Their hands clutch at the mirror-ground, fingers digging into the liquid surface as if trying to grasp something—or someone—just out of reach. Ripples spread outward from their touch, distorting the fractured memories beneath into grotesque, unrecognizable shapes.

I stand only a few paces away, my gaze fixed on their anguish. Their pain is palpable, a heavy weight that seems to thicken the air around us, pressing against my skin like a storm about to break. And yet, as I watch them unravel, I feel... nothing. My heart does not ache. My chest does not tighten with sympathy. There is no urge to reach out, to offer a comforting word or touch. I am a hollow observer, a statue carved from ice, untouched by the inferno of their suffering. Their cries, so raw and desperate, are mere sounds to me, no more meaningful than the distant rustle of nonexistent leaves.

This absence of emotion is stark, a yawning void within me. I recognize it with a cold, clinical clarity, as though I am dissecting myself under a surgeon’s lamp. Where there should be warmth, compassion, or even the faintest flicker of pity, there is only an echoing emptiness. I tilt my head, curious, examining the figure’s torment as one might study an insect beneath glass—fascinated by the mechanics of it, but utterly detached from its essence. Why do I not feel? Why does their heartbreak not stir even a ripple in the still waters of my soul?

Suddenly, the figure turns their head, just enough for me to catch a glimpse of their face—or what should be a face. There is nothing there but a swirling void, a black hole where features should be, drawing in the golden light of the sky until it vanishes into oblivion. Their cries grow louder, more insistent, and I realize with a start that they are not weeping for themselves but for me. They mourn my lack of feeling, my inability to connect, as though they can see the barren wasteland within me and grieve for what I’ve lost—or perhaps never had.

I take a step back, the mirror-ground rippling beneath me, and for the first time, a faint unease stirs in my chest. It is not empathy, not sorrow, but a creeping dread, as if I am on the verge of understanding something terrible about myself. The figure rises slowly, their shadowy cloak billowing like smoke, and they stretch a trembling hand toward me. I do not know if they mean to harm or to heal, but I feel the weight of their unspoken plea—a plea for me to feel, to bridge the chasm between us.

And yet, I remain still, rooted to the spot, my empty heart refusing to answer. The golden veins in the sky above begin to crack, spilling luminous fragments that rain down like tears, and the haunting melody of the wind crescendos into a scream. I stand there, unfeeling, as the world of my dream begins to shatter around me, knowing that even if it crumbles entirely, I will awaken with the same cold void inside.
