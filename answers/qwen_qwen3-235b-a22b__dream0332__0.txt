I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The sky is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury, rippling with reflections of forgotten faces. Beneath your feet, the ground shifts like wet sand, solidifying only when you stop questioning where you are. You walk through a city built of inverted logic: towers spiral downward into the earth, their foundations clawing at the sun, while rivers flow uphill, defying gravity to nourish forests of crystalline thorns. The air hums with a dissonant choir—voices arguing in languages you’ve never learned, yet somehow understand. *This is not a place,* you realize. *It’s a question.*  

You arrive at a plaza where a colossal statue looms—a monument to the belief you’ve carried like a sacred text. Let’s say it’s *equality*: the idea that all minds are born with equal potential, that talent and virtue are distributed democratically across humanity. The statue’s face is yours, but also everyone’s. Its hands cradle a scale, balanced and serene. You’ve defended this ideal for years, weaponizing it in debates, stitching it into your identity. But here, in this dream, the scale begins to tremble.  

A crowd materializes, their bodies flickering like film strips. They thrust evidence into your hands: scrolls of data, screaming headlines, memories that aren’t yours. You see a child in a neon-lit slum, her synapses starved of nutrients before she could read. You witness a man’s genius calcified by trauma, his mind a locked vault no key can turn. You hear the laughter of those born into dynasties of privilege, their mediocrity gilded by inheritance. The contradictions pile up like corpses. *If the scale was never level to begin with,* whispers a voice that sounds like your own, *what does that make your faith in fairness?*  

Your chest tightens. The plaza tilts. You claw at the ground, now sprouting thorned vines that draw blood with every touch. The cognitive dissonance isn’t abstract—it’s a physical force. A black hole in your gut, swallowing logic whole. You want to scream, to wake up, but the dream anchors you. It demands more.  

Suddenly, the statue shatters. From its ruins rises a creature—a chimera of wolf and serpent, its fur made of barbed wire, its eyes twin eclipses. It speaks without moving its jaws: *“Beliefs are cages. Even the noblest ones. You clung to equality as if it were a fact, not a fight. But what if justice isn’t a static truth? What if it’s a verb?”*  

The world dissolves into a second sun. You’re falling through a canyon of fractal doors, each one a possibility. Behind one, you see yourself as a tyrant enforcing “equality” with iron rigor, crushing diversity to ash. Behind another, you’re a coward, using the myth of fairness to justify inaction while systems rot. The creature’s voice booms: *“Your belief blinded you. Not to the value of justice—but to the cost of it.”*  

Then, silence.  

You land softly in a field of ash and wildflowers. A child sits nearby, planting seeds in soil that writhes with bioluminescent worms. “What’s the answer?” you ask. The child shrugs. “There’s no answer. Only more honest questions.” She hands you a seed. When you open your palm, it’s your own heart, still beating.  

The dream ends.  

You wake drenched in sweat, the taste of mercury on your tongue. The political belief you once held immutable now feels like a half-remembered hymn—its melody haunting, but its lyrics irreparably changed. Somewhere in your bones, a new resolve stirs: not the comfort of certainty, but the vertigo of becoming.
