I am dreaming. I am floating in a sky that pulses like living stained glass. Every brush of cloud beneath my skin hums with color: sapphire currents, molten-gold eddies, whispers of violet. I drift through this cathedral of air, weightless, while a distant chant—half-remembered, half-invented—rises and falls like breath.  

A messenger of light descends: neither bird nor human, but a shifting silhouette composed of soft lamplight and dancing motes. Their voice, a chorus of echoes, unfolds around me: “Your life is not the thread you’ve followed; it is the tapestry you were meant to weave.”  

In an instant, the scenery dissolves. I find myself in a hall of mirrors, each pane reflecting a different version of me: one clothed in desert winds, one garbed in coral reefs, another crowned with midnight stars. My chest stirs with anticipation rather than fear.  

The messenger’s form reappears behind me, guiding my gaze to a single mirror. Its glass ripples like liquid mercury, and as I lean closer, history spills out: scenes I never knew I’d lived—  
• Childhood laughter echoing on the deck of a wooden ship sailing across a sea of fireflies.  
• A hidden alcove in an underground library where I brushed fingers with lost gods and penned poems on scrolls of moonlight.  
• Moments of quiet heroism: rescuing a wounded phoenix, teaching a silent forest to speak.  

My heart does not wrench; it expands. With each new revelation I feel an ancient song swelling in my veins, as if my very blood remembers every forgotten quest and every secret promise I made long before this body was born.  

Rather than being overwhelmed by this revelation, I welcome it like an old friend. I raise my arms as the mirrors shatter in slow motion, shards becoming ribbons of memory that swirl around me. Each ribbon sings its own note, and together they weave a symphony of self. I hear not confusion but clarity: my identity is not a single line but a kaleidoscope of all I have been—and all I will be.  

Suddenly the stained-glass sky reassembles overhead, more vibrant than before. Wherever I gaze, new constellations pulse into being—symbols of secret strengths I have yet to claim. I realize that the dream is not merely revealing my past; it is igniting my future.  

With a confident leap, I dive into the luminescent clouds. Every impact sends ripples across the panorama of the sky, and each ripple births a seed of possibility: a hidden talent waiting to unfurl, a relationship yearning to bloom, a path that twists toward adventure.  

As I fall, the messenger’s voice calls after me—less a warning now, more an invocation: “Go forth. Become the legend you half-remember, and the hero you have yet to imagine.”  

I wake—or perhaps I do not truly wake, for the dream has become my soul’s true compass. And even as reality’s edges come back into focus, I carry that cosmic sky within me, humming, luminous, alive with potential.
