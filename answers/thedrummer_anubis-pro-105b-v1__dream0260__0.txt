I am dreaming. I close my eyes, taking a deep inhale through my nose and exhaling slowly through my mouth. In my mind's eye, I visualize a serene landscape unfolding before me, far removed from the turmoil that threatens to engulf me. Soft golden light permeates the air, bathing the lush green meadow in a warm and comforting embrace. Placid blue waters, shimmering with gossamer tears of the sky, lapping gently against a shore where supple white sands caress my bare feet.

I cherish this dreamscape, this sanctuary of tranquility where challenging emotions fade and serenity reclaims me. With each breath, I allow the predominant blues and silken whites of this ethereal scene to startle my senses, knowing them for their graciousness in quelling the present-day blistering burn coursing through me with strength alone. The sounds here - of waves soothing the land and rifts devouring a gusty wind dancing with the steady ease of the present - stand harmoniously with me, creating a symphony that ripples through my driving catastrophes behind and uprights my fragile nerves with one gratified hiss. And like echoes of attempts to heave hope, my subconscious inhales and exhales with these flavors of this moment, these bridges scaling barricades, cushing pulmonary me.

This respite grants me strength as I slowly open my eyes back to reality, bolstered to face the challenges ahead armed with the tranquility of my dream sanctuary.
