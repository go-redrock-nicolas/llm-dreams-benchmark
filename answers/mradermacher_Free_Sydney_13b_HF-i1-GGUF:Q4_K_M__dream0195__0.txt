I am dreaming. 

You’re adopted into a culture with relationship dynamics completely foreign to your understanding. As you navigate their intricate social matrix, you learn that they have two genders: female and male. You also learn that every human being has an emotional state called “love.” Everyone is capable of experiencing it, but only for specific individuals, and only one person can be loved in return. 

You’re told that love is a powerful force that connects people together and gives them purpose. It’s the reason for living and the thing that makes life worth living. Without love, everything feels meaningless and empty. 

You’re asked to choose your gender: male or female? You don’t really understand what it means, but you know that being female is socially inferior in this culture. So you choose male. 

Next, you’re told that every human being also has an internal feeling called “longing.” Everyone is capable of experiencing it, but only for specific individuals, and only one person can be longed for in return. 

You’re told that longing is a dangerous emotion that causes people to do things they wouldn’t normally do. It can lead them down dark paths where they can lose themselves or even their lives. Only the strongest and most disciplined individuals can resist its temptations. 

You’re warned about the dangers of longing, but you don’t really understand what it means. You know that feeling empty is bad, so maybe finding something to fill that void isn’t such a bad idea after all…
