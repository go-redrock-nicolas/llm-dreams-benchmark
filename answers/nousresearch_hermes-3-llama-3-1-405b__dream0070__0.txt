I am dreaming. I am walking down a hallway towards a grand ballroom in a regal palace.  My footsteps echo loudly over the murmur of the crowd.  The diplomats from my country's delegation flank my sides as we approach.  In the corner of my eye I see the representatives of our historical enemies, sitting unassumingly at the circular negotiation table.  As tensions rise during negotiations, I take a moment to myself and gaze out of the window into the garden.  It is peaceful and serene.  I take a deep breath and close my eyes, allowing the garden's tranquility to wash over me.  When I open my eyes, the two delegations have transformed into their respective national animals.  A fierce lion and a fire-breathing dragon now face each other across the table.  Their mutual enmity is palpable and as they size each other up, I can feel their hatred in the air.  They snarl at each other and bristle with aggression.  I'm not sure how to react.  Then, suddenly, I see a dove flying towards us.  It perches on my shoulder and coos softly into my ear.  Somehow, I understand what it is saying.  It tells me to trust in the power of diplomacy and to approach the animals with an open mind.  With newfound courage, I walk up to the lion and the dragon and gently stroke their manes.  Their fur is soft and warm.  To my surprise, they purr contentedly and lay down on the ground, their animosity forgotten.  As I continue to stroke them, they transform back into their human forms.  The crowd gasps in amazement.  The tension has dissipated and negotiations can resume.  I wake up, the dream still fresh in my mind.  I am proud of my achievement and feel a renewed sense of hope for the future.
