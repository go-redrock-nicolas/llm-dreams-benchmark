I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself in a lush forest, with trees so tall they seem to reach for the sky. The canopy above me is a patchwork of green and gold leaves, filtering the sunlight that dapples the forest floor.

As I walk deeper into the woods, I become aware of the chatter of a nearby stream. The sound draws me closer, and I come upon a crystal-clear pool in which I see my reflection, clear and sharp. Around the edge of the pool, wildflowers grow in profusion, their colors vivid against the emerald green moss.

Suddenly, the sound of rustling leaves catches my attention, and I turn to see a majestic stag standing just a few feet away, its antlers catching the light. Its eyes meet mine, and for a moment, we share a silent understanding.

As the dream continues, I sense the presence of other creatures - birds fluttering in the treetops, squirrels scampering across the forest floor. I feel completely at peace, immersed in the beauty and wonder of this magical place.

But then, a sense of urgency washes over me. I have a feeling that I must find something important, but I'm not sure what. The air grows thick and heavy, and the forest seems to be closing in around me. My heart races as I pick up the pace, my senses alert to any clue that will lead me to whatever it is I am seeking.

The path begins to narrow, and I find myself climbing over fallen logs and pushing through dense underbrush. The sunlight fades, and the forest becomes dark and eerie. Just when I think I might be lost forever, I stumble upon a hidden clearing.

In the center of the clearing stands an old tree, its trunk gnarled and twisted. At its base, I see a small, smooth stone that seems to glow softly in the dark. As I reach down to pick it up, I wake up, the dream fading quickly from memory.
