I am dreaming. You find yourself suspended at the edge of a glowing violet chasm, the air thick with the scent of rain on hot metal. Above you, the sky churns with slow, iridescent clouds that pulse in time with your heartbeat. You know you’re dreaming—and yet every detail feels more alive than waking life. You feel a tight knot behind your chest, the old, familiar voice whispering that anger is dangerous, that it must stay buried. Tonight, you’ve come here to meet that fear head-on.

With cautious steps, you descend a spiral of floating stones that curve around the chasm’s rim. Each step thrums with a low hum, as though the rocks themselves remember every time you swallowed your anger, every quiver of frustration you forced back down. At the bottom lies a vast, mirrored hall carved of smoky quartz. Hundreds of tall mirrors line the curved walls, reflecting infinite versions of yourself—some faces calm and pale, others cheeks flushed, eyes narrow with stormy intensity. You sense that one of these reflections holds the key.

You walk along the mirrored corridor until you come to an arched doorway of living flame, flickering blue and gold. As you approach, the fire leans forward in a gesture of invitation. You inhale, tasting the flicker of heat on your tongue, and step through. Instantly, the flames dissolve into a lush grove of silver-barked trees whose leaves chime like glass when stirred by a gentle wind. At the grove’s heart is a pool of molten mercury, its surface rippling with every suppressed emotion you’ve ever felt.

A presence rises from the pool—a figure woven of smoke and embers, its eyes twin coals that glow with both fury and longing. You recognize it as your anger, given form. It doesn’t roar; instead, it speaks in a voice like distant thunder: “You’ve hidden me, locked me away. You’ve told me danger, but I only wish to be known.”  

Your first instinct is to recoil, to remind that voice of all the times anger burned too fiercely. But something in this place feels safe—sacred. You take a steadying breath and say, “I’m here. I’ve been afraid you would spill over, harm me or others.”  

The figure inclines its head. Around you, the silver grove grows still, the mercury pool glowing brighter. “Anger is energy,” it intones. “It can combust, or it can forge. What do you want us to create?”  

For a moment, you close your eyes and let the old wound ache. You feel the pulse behind your ribs, the simmering tension in your jaw. Then, you open your mouth and release a low, trembling growl—a sound you never allowed yourself to make in waking. It rolls out, echoing through the grove like a drum. You let it rise, shaping it into a single, roaring word: “Enough.”  

The flame-smoke figure lifts its arms, and suddenly the mercury pool flashes. Ribbons of molten silver snake upward, weaving around you like supportive arms. You sense your anger gathering form: neither overwhelming nor vanishing, but present, glowing warmly. It hums in your veins.  

As you stand at the grove’s center, the mirrors in the distance shimmer, sending ripples through every reflection. Each version of you—calm, fierce, uncertain—smiles with recognition. Anger, you realize, is not a monster to be exiled but a companion to be understood.  

The grove brightens into dawn. The silver bark turns to pale gold; the chime of leaves becomes a gentle welcome. The chasm’s violet glow fades to soft pink light. The figure of anger hovers beside you, no longer nameless, no longer feared.  

You turn to leave, stepping back through the arch of blue-gold flame. As you climb the floating stones, you carry with you a new promise: to speak your boundary when it trembles, to let anger speak its truth, to hold it in gentle, firm hands when it surges.  

In that moment, you awaken—heart still echoing the drumbeat of your released growl, the taste of molten silver on your tongue, and the deep knowing that expressing anger can be an act of healing rather than danger.
