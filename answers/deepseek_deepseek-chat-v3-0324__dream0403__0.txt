I am dreaming. It begins with a whisper—a single word, sharp as a splinter, lodged in the soft tissue of my mind. *Unimportant. Unimportant. Unimportant.* The voice is familiar, but distorted, as if echoing through a long, dark corridor.  

The world around me is not a world at all, but a shifting landscape of liquid shadow and fractured light. I stand on a bridge made of glass, suspended over an abyss where constellations swirl like schools of silver fish. Below, the stars blink in and out of existence, winking at me with cold, indifferent eyes.  

The slight—whatever it was—curls around my thoughts like smoke, thickening with every breath. I see the face of the person who spoke it, but their features are smeared, as though painted in watercolors left in the rain. Their mouth moves, but the words are swallowed by the wind, leaving only the aftertaste of hurt.  

A weight settles in my chest, heavy as a stone, pulling me toward the edge of the bridge. I grip the railing, but it melts like warm wax beneath my fingers. The stars below pulse brighter, as if hungry.  

Then—a sound. A single, clear note, like a bell struck in a silent cathedral. The air shivers. From the darkness, a figure emerges—not human, but something woven from moonlight and moth wings. Their presence is cool, soothing, like a hand pressed to a fevered brow.  

*Why do you hold this?* they ask, though their voice is not a voice at all, but a feeling, a knowing.  

I try to answer, but the words crumble like ash in my mouth.  

The being reaches out, and in their palm rests the slight—a tiny, jagged shard of obsidian, glinting with a sickly light. They blow gently, and it dissolves into a thousand fireflies, scattering into the void.  

The bridge solidifies beneath my feet. The stars below dim, retreating.  

And then—I am falling upward, into a sky the color of forgiveness.
