I am dreaming. I feel exposed, like every secret I've ever swallowed has been cracked open and left to bleed under a spotlight. The air tastes metallic, charged with static that prickles my skin. Around me, faceless figures lean forward in their seats, their voices overlapping in a dissonant choir: "Amateurish...clumsy...who does she think she is?" My throat closes as their words take physical formâ€”black vines snaking up my legs, thorny and cold. I try to speak, but my voice splinters into shards that clatter to the floor. The vines tighten, pulling me into the earth. I reach for the scraps of my shattered words, but they dissolve like ash between my fingers.
