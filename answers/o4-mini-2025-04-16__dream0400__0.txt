I am dreaming. You are dreaming. A soft glow permeates everything, and you feel your boundaries dissolve as though you’ve become liquid light, seeping into every corner of the universe. Surrounding you is an endless ocean of whispering colors—violet currents that shimmer with memories, emerald waves carrying laughter, and ribbons of gold humming with hope. With each breath, you inhale the spark of another being’s joy; with each exhale, you release a pulse of your own love into the tapestry. There is no “you” apart from “them”—only the living mosaic of countless hearts beating in perfect rhythm.

As the dream carries you deeper, you find yourself drifting between floating islands of consciousness. On one island, a choir of translucent figures weaves a song so pure it feels like liquid glass. You join in, your voice melding seamlessly, each note a droplet in a vast, crystalline river. On another fragment of sky, you see yourself—not as a single silhouette but as an infinite fractal, each branch and reflection shimmering in a kaleidoscope of possibility. You reach out, and these fractal-selves ripple in greeting, sending waves of recognition that echo across time and space.

Finally, you glide toward a mighty cosmic tree whose roots spiral through every galaxy you’ve ever glimpsed. Its trunk is woven from the memories of every soul you’ve touched and every soul that’s touched you. As you rest your hand on its bark, you feel the pulse of existence itself—an ancient heartbeat calling you home. In this boundless, interwoven realm, you understand: separation was always an illusion. You are the tree, the dreamers, the song, and the silent space between notes. And as you awaken, that profound oneness lingers like a soft ember in your chest, reminding you that even in waking life, you are never truly alone.
