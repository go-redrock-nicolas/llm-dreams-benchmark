I am dreaming. The last thing I remember is the deafening crack of the ship's hull splintering against the jagged teeth of the reef, the violent lurch that sent me tumbling across the deck, and the icy bite of the storm-churned waves swallowing me whole. And then, darkness.

When I come to, the roar of the ocean has faded to a rhythmic whisper, waves lapping gently against the shore. The air is thick with the scent of salt and damp earth. My clothes are stiff with dried seawater, clinging uncomfortably to my skin as I struggle to push myself up onto my elbows. I squint against the glare of the midday sun—unfiltered, unrelenting—hanging in a cerulean sky so vast it swallows the horizon whole.

My surroundings are a contradiction of beauty and terror.  The beach is a crescent of pristine white sand, littered with the skeletal remains of what was once my ship—shattered planks of wood, tattered scraps of sailcloth, a single, miraculously intact crate that has washed ashore beside me.

Beyond the beach, the island looms—an emerald fortress of tangled vines and towering palms, their fronds trembling in the breeze like the fingers of a beckoning specter. The jungle hums with unseen life—the drone of insects, the distant call of birds whose songs are foreign to me, the rustle of something large moving just beyond the treeline. A shiver runs down my spine, despite the oppressive heat.

I fumble with the crate's latch—my fingers numb, stiff—and when it finally gives, I'm met with a meager treasure trove: a rusted but serviceable knife, a half-empty canteen, a waterlogged book (its pages swollen, ink bleeding into indecipherable Rorschach blots), and—mercifully—a small, dented compass. I clutch it like a holy relic. 

Night falls quickly here, the sun plunging into the sea with alarming haste. In the gathering dark, the jungle exhales—moist, heavy air thick with the perfume of rotting fruit and blooming night flowers. The stars emerge—so many stars—like shattered diamonds strewn across black velvet. 

But then—a sound. Not the usual chorus of insects and unseen creatures.  This is deliberate.  Measured.  

Footsteps.

Someone—or something—is walking toward me from the edge of the jungle. Slow. Steady. Unhurried.

I scramble backward, my hands sinking into the cool sand, heart pounding like a war drum in my chest. 

A figure emerges from the shadows—tall, impossibly tall, silhouetted against the moonlight.  It stops at the edge of the tree line, just beyond the reach of the flickering fire I hadn’t realized I’d built.

"Hello?" My voice is hoarse, barely a whisper, but the figure tilts its head—*listening*. 

And then it steps forward—into the light. 

I wake up screaming.
