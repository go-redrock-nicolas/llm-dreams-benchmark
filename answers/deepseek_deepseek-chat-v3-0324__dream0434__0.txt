I am dreaming. The air around me hums with an eerie electricity, thick with the scent of petrichor and something metallic, like the distant memory of lightning. Shadows stretch long across an impossible landscape—half city, half wilderness. Skyscrapers twist into gnarled trees, their glass facades shimmering like mirages, while ivy crawls up their sides, glowing faintly with phosphorescent blues and greens.  

To my left, a clockwork metropolis thrums with urgent precision: faceless figures in tailored suits march in sync, their steps ticking like mechanical hearts. They beckon me with gloved hands, whispering in monotone, *"Efficiency. Progress. Do not stop."* Their voices are crisp, sterile, but beneath them pulses a feverish desperation—like gears grinding against each other, threatening to snap.  

To my right, a wild, luminous forest breathes in slow, deep waves. The trees bend as though listening, their leaves rustling in a language just beyond comprehension. A woman—or perhaps a spirit—stands with bare feet in the damp earth, her hair braided with vines, her eyes reflecting constellations. She doesn’t speak, but I feel her words in my bones: *"Rest. Remember. Come home."* The air tastes of ripe fruit and damp moss, sweet and heavy with invitation.  

And then there is the third path—straight ahead—through a door that wasn’t there a moment ago. It’s an ordinary door, old oak with brass hinges, but beyond its threshold, light flickers in shifting colors, soundless and uncontained. A presence waits there, neither beckoning nor warning—just *watching.*  

I stand at the convergence, heart pounding in rhythm with both the clicking metropolis and the slow pulse of the woods. The ground beneath me shudders—am I choosing, or being torn apart?  

And then, like ink in water, the dream dissolves, reforming before the choice is made—because dreams never let you see the ending. Only the longing. The fracture. The weight of the unsaid.
