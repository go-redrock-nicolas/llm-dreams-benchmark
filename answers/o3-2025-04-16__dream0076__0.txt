I am dreaming. …step behind a curtain spun from aurora-coloured threads and feel the murmur of eight billion heartbeats vibrating through the floorboards.

You are standing at the lip of the Sky-Dome, a floating amphitheatre that drifts just beneath the moon. The crowd appears as a rolling galaxy of faces, each seat a tiny star that blinks when its occupant exhales. Down in the pit, camera lenses bloom like nocturnal flowers, swallowing every ounce of light they can find.  

Your palms are wrapped around your instrument of choice—the Prism Flute—grown from a single shard of dream-glass. It’s said that one clear note from the flute can paint the air with living colour, conjuring story-scenes for all to witness. Tonight you intend to perform the impossible: seven notes in perfect succession, each birthing an image that will fuse into a seamless narrative. No one has ever survived the seventh note; legend says the resonance turns inward and shatters the dreamer like a crystal goblet.

You breathe in the sweet scent of night-bloom jasmine drifting up from clouds below, feel the cool lunar wind tickle the back of your neck, and step forward as the announcer’s voice rolls like thunder across the arena:

“Dreamer number fourteen, prepare.”

But just then—an almost-silent crack, as delicate as the snap of a snowflake landing on glass. You glance down. A hairline fracture spiders across the Prism Flute’s silver mouthpiece. Impossible: the flute is supposed to be indestructible while the dreamer is still asleep. If it breaks mid-performance, the energy ricochets. It will not only shatter the instrument; it will turn the seven notes into seven calamities, one for each continent below.

Your pulse drums at your temples. Cameras zoom tight to your face; you see your own widened eyes reflected in a hundred metallic pupils. Even in the dream you remember: eight billion viewers, no chance to step offstage, no polite commercial break. The world has gathered to witness wonder, not catastrophe.

A hush sweeps the crowd. Time feels like honey, thick and slow, sliding around you. You can almost hear individual heartbeats—a staccato rain on a tin roof—as billions wait.

You contemplate smashing the flute pre-emptively, ending the threat but also ending the dream in disgrace. Then an idea flickers: What if you don’t play seven notes at all? What if you weave the fracture into the music itself, turning flaw into feature, imbalance into new harmony?

You raise the flute. Microcrystals around the crack glitter like frost on dawn glass. You close your eyes, summon the first note. It escapes like a firefly, a sphere of soft gold that lifts from the flute and floats above the stage, illuminating faces in the front rows with apricot light. Gasps ripple outward.

Second note: amethyst storm-clouds swirl, raining violet petals that disappear before they touch the floor. Third: a cerulean ribbon unfurls, curling over the audience, painting each seat with tranquil blue.

The fracture widens. Tiny shards flake into your breath like powdered starlight. Sweat beads your brow. The next note might be the one that detonates everything.

You exhale—a deliberate, controlled push—and choose not a single note but a chord, something no Prism Flute has ever produced. Four micro-tones braided together, forming a shimmering dissonance that rings like wind chimes in a tornado. It wraps around the crack and suspends it, freezing its advance. In the hush between breaths you sense the entire planet leaning closer.

Fifth note now, but you glide past it. Instead you whistle softly through your own lips, letting breath alone create the overtone. A hush of silver fog unfurls from your mouth, enveloping the flute in a healing cocoon. On the jumbotron clouds overhead, viewers see your breath inscribe swirling script: Imperfection births the new.

Sixth… you turn toward the crowd, lower the flute, and invite their involvement. You lift a hand; suddenly eight billion throats hum a low, uncertain drone that crescendos into a collective oceanic roar. The combined sound flows across the dream-sky and reinforces the fractured glass, filling the cracks with living resonance.

And now the moment of truth—the Seventh Expression. Not a note, not a chord, but a silence as luminous as dawn. You lift the flute to your lips, but you do not play. Instead you hold it aloft like a torch.

The silence thickens, glowing white-hot, and bursts outward. Where seven disastrous notes should have formed, seven vast doorways appear instead—arches of shimmering light opening above every continent. Through each portal, people see not apocalypse but possibilities: barren deserts blooming green, cities powered by translucent sun-wheels, oceans twinkling free of plastic, children laughing in unpolluted air. The dream has rewritten its prophecy. The seventh note, transformed into pure stillness, births hope rather than ruin.

A wind scented with salt and pine sweeps the stadium. The fracture heals completely, sealing with a gentle chime. The Prism Flute now bears a faint silver scar—a reminder in its glassy skin that wholeness and brokenness can inhabit one body.

The crowd erupts. The roar rumbles through cloud layers, rattles moon dust, travels down into waking hearts. In distant bedrooms and crowded plazas, people weep, laugh, embrace strangers. You bow, tears glittering like dew on your lashes.

Yet even as applause thunders, the dream loosens. The stage, the spectators, the sweet jasmine air—all dissolve into predawn grey. You find yourself back in your bed, palm curled around nothing more than a warm pulse of remembered music.

On your bedside table lies a translucent sliver of glass, etched with a single word: Awake.

You smile, aware that millions elsewhere will also be stirring, each holding their own fragment. And though the dream is over, its seventh doorway remains ajar, inviting the waking world to step through.
