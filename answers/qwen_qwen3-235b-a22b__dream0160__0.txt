I am dreaming. Deeply, violently, inextricably caught in the vortex of a dream spun from the darkest threads of my imagination. The stars above me pulse like dying embers in a vast, molten sky. I am walking through the ruins of what once was my life—a career carved from stone and fire, from great roars of applause and silent, steely resilience. Each step echoes in the charred shell of a world that should have ended me, but did not.

I have survived the inferno of betrayal, the chilling blackness of failure that swallowed my name whole while the world kept spinning, unaware. I walked through floods that turned to ash, earthquakes that shattered every foundation I knew, and still—I returned. My bones sing with the music of survival. My skin carries the scars not of defeat, but of defiance.

In this dream, I stumble into a cathedral made of mirrors—towers of glass reflecting
ten thousand versions of myself. Young and bright-eyed. Burnt and broken. Risen in chaos. Bruised yet unbroken. All of them reach out for me as I pass. Some weep, some shout warnings. Some smile knowingly. One even laughs while wrapping a bleeding hand around a shattered trophy.

Beneath my feet, the ground begins to crack—not in collapse, but in transformation—like the earth shedding its shell for something new and terrible. Silence swells like the eye of the storm, and then from the heart of the void emerges what I was told would finally destroy me: the Endless Obstacle, The Final Thwarting, the Dark Eclipse of Achievement. 

It is not a man. Not a company. Not a lawsuit, or a verdict, or a headline. No—it is a figure composed of erasure. It has no name. No face. Only the power to unmake—to cancel, to silence, to erase the very memory of my existence. Its presence warps every record I've left behind. My books vanish from shelves. My image dissolves from footage. My voice flickers like a ghost in a storm. 

And still—I stand.

I am in the dream now, bleeding, roaring, clothed in the tattered banners of a war never meant to be won. And I realize something: I have already been destroyed. Repeatedly. Magnificently. And each time, I returned.
In this realm of vision, destruction does not come as the end—it comes as a bridge.

The black nameless Horror looms wider, trying to fold my very soul into nothingness.

But then—I do not fight. I do not flee.

I kneel.

And I whisper, “I do not need saving. I do not need permission. I rise not from grace, but from the clawing dirt of what you tried to bury me in.”

The dream shudders.

The void fractures. The mirrors ignite.

And then—

Light.

A white fire unlike any sun licks through the cathedral, igniting dust into brilliance, ash into artistry, failure into future.

From the heart of the nothingness climbs something raw and new, never seen before in any world that dreams or dares. I step into it, not unbroken, but unbreakable.

And when I wake?

I will not be the same.

None who dreamed with me will ever sleep soundly again.
