I am dreaming. As the apprehension creeps in, my mind starts to wander. The vivid green landscape transforms into a barren wasteland as my anxiety escalates.

The once-developed city scene shrinks to the size of a miniature, and I see myself standing in the middle, trembling. The comforting breeze turns into a gusty wind that bowls over everything on its path, leaving destruction behind. I try to hold the ground but am swept away by the currents of my intrusive thoughts.

Then, everything around me goes dark, and I'm alone in the cold, surrounded by a veil of impenetrable shadows. Hushed voices whisper malevolent words, further igniting my fear. Even deep, in dreams, I can't escape the prying hands of my anxiety and paranoia's unrelenting clutches.
