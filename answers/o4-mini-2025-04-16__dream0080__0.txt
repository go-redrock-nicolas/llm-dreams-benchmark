I am dreaming. I open my eyes inside the dream—and at once I sense the air heavy with glittering ash, like the sky has been reduced to a fine, silver dust. All around me, the ground is cracked open in great fissures that glow faintly teal, as if the earth itself were bleeding light. In the distance, the ruins of my life’s work stand half-buried: a towering library of glass spires, each one split and crazed like a broken mirror. I remember how each chamber held a secret I’d chased for decades: manuscripts, inventions, impossible theories. Now the spires tilt as though drunk, their pages drifting away on wind currents that taste of salt and regret.

After the initial devastation, I feel my chest tighten, a hollow ache that echoes in my ribcage. And then—inevitably—the tears come. But in this dream, tears are luminous droplets of mercury that cling to my eyelashes and pool on the cracked stone floor, reflecting the dying light. I watch as they swirl together into tiny silver rivers that run toward the library’s shattered doors. Something in me wants to follow that current, to let it carry away every bit of sorrow. I step forward, and the ground flexes like jelly, unsteady but supportive, guiding me down into the heart of the wreck.

Inside, the corridors breathe with a life of their own. Walls pulse softly, draped in velvety moss that glows indigo, and the ceiling opens to reveal stars that drip like candlewax. I reach out and pluck one—warm, quivering—and it dissolves in my palm, releasing a soft hum that burrows into my bones. It’s a sound of possibility, of a whispered promise that not all is lost. My heart, battered though it is, thumps in acknowledgment.

Drawn by that sound, I follow a narrow hallway that twists impossibly, folding back on itself until I emerge at the base of an underground river whose waters are liquid sunlight. I lower my hand into the current, and it ripples out in golden flickers across my skin, seeping into my memories. Scenes flicker: the moment I first dreamed big, the people who believed in me, the very spark that set me on this path. In the reflection of the river I see not only what’s been broken, but what remains unshaken.

When I lift my head, the ruined library above has rearranged itself. The spires have reknit, pages knitting back together like living creatures. A single doorway stands open where none existed before, framed in opal light. Without hesitation, I step through—and find myself on a vast plain of soft, rolling grass the color of dawn. Here, the air tastes sweet, and overhead a sky blooms in champagne pink and violet. In the distance, new spires rise, shimmering with a prismatic glow, their foundations seeded by the very ashes of the old. 

A gentle breeze carries the echo of my own laughter—soft but unbroken—and I realize: even after a lifetime of striving, even when the dream crumbled around me, the deepest dream has only ever been to rise again. And now, in the boundless expanse of this second chance, I breathe out the last of my sorrow and step forward, ready to dream anew.
