I am dreaming. Okay, the world warps and settles... I am dreaming.

The air in this *place* – it vaguely resembles the office, but the walls shimmer like petrol on water, and the ceiling fan drips slow, iridescent tears of light – is thick and acrid with unspoken resentment. Before me stand Anya and Ben, though they too seem distorted by the dream's lens. Anya's usually sharp suit seems woven from brittle glass shards, reflecting the harsh fluorescent glow with painful intensity. Ben's tie writhes like a startled snake, its pattern shifting (bùduàn de - constantly).

Between them, on a warped table that seems to groan under the weight, rests the Project. It’s not blueprints or a model, not exactly. It’s more like a pulsating heart made of tangled wires and stressed metal, emitting a low, anxious hum that vibrates through the soles of my dream-feet. Their argument isn't just words; it's a storm raging in the confined space. Anya's voice cracks like shattering ice, sending fissures through the already trembling air. Ben's rebuttals are heavy, physical thuds that make the light-tears from the ceiling fan splash onto the floor, evaporating instantly with a dissatisfied hiss. They gesture wildly, not *at* the Project, but *through* it, their hands passing through the humming tangle as if it were smoke, yet somehow making it pulse faster, more erratically. The fate of this vital, humming thing hangs precariously between their fury.

Suddenly, the storm ceases. The frantic energy coalesces, focuses, and beams directly at *me*. The shimmering walls seem to lean in, the air pressure changes, and silence descends, thick and expectant. Two pairs of eyes, burning with the residue of their anger and desperate for validation, lock onto mine.

"Well?" Anya's voice, though quieter now, still scrapes like metal on stone. "You've heard it all. Who's right? Whose approach will save this?"

Ben nods curtly, his serpentine tie momentarily still, poised. "Yes. Tell us. Whose fault will it be when this all falls apart?"

They stand there, demanding a verdict, needing a scapegoat or a champion. The weight of their expectation is a physical thing in the dream, threatening to crush me. I feel the familiar urge to dissect, to analyze, to offer a balanced, logical perspective... but this is a dreamscape, and logic is a foreign currency here.

Instead of forming words, a strange calm blooms within my chest, radiating outwards. I look from Anya's furious intensity to Ben's rigid frustration, then down at the anxious, humming Project between them. And I smile.

It’s not a calculated smile, nor one of amusement. It feels like… releasing a breath I didn’t know I was holding, a breath infused with the scent of damp earth and growing things. As the smile spreads across my face, the floor beneath my feet softens. The cold, hard tile gives way, transforming rapidly into a carpet of lush, vibrant green moss, cool and yielding. It spreads outwards from me in a circle, swallowing the harsh reflections and silencing the last echoes of their argument.

Anya and Ben gasp, their demanding expressions melting into bewildered awe. The moss creeps up the shimmering walls, transforming them into ancient stones covered in ivy. Tendrils of green reach the ceiling, and the dripping lights soften, becoming dappled sunlight filtering through an unseen canopy. The acrid smell is replaced by the rich fragrance of a forest floor after rain. The low hum of the Project changes pitch, softening into a gentle thrum, and the tangled wires begin to sprout tiny, bioluminescent flowers that pulse with soft, calming light.

Neither Anya nor Ben speaks. Their sharp edges seem to have smoothed out. Anya reaches down tentatively, touching a velvety moss patch. Ben stares upwards, watching a dream-vine unfurl a perfect, pearlescent leaf where a harsh light fixture had been. The argument, the need to be right, the looming failure – it all seems to dissolve, washed away by the sudden, inexplicable verdancy. They didn't get an answer, not the one they sought. Instead, the question itself became irrelevant, absorbed by the gentle, encroaching wilderness born from a quiet smile in the heart of a dream. The air is clear now, filled only with the soft pulse of the blooming Project and the silent wonder of the transformed space.
