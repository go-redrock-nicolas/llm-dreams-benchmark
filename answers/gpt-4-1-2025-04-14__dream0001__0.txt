I am dreaming. I blink awake in a city I’ve never seen—a metropolis woven from silver and jade, where impossible skyscrapers spiral like vines into a firefly-drenched twilight. The air feels electric, tinged with the sweet aroma of rain on ancient stone. My hand is empty, but I’m sure I had a map—yes, for there’s a meeting, terribly important, in one short hour. Yet I have no address, no clear direction, only the sensation of being terribly late and utterly lost.

Panic clatters at my heartbeat, but as I begin to walk, the scenery quivers and shifts: streets undulate beneath my feet, becoming glass bridges over canals glowing with luminous koi, or broad avenues lined with towering trees bearing blossoms made of porcelain. Every person I pass is a stranger with a story in their eyes—some gaze at me with a kind of secret recognition, as if expecting me, others vanish in motes of golden light the moment I look too closely.

I stumble into a bustling square composed of spiraling staircases and floating gardens. The clocks here have no hands; time is measured instead by the blossoming and wilting of massive flowers on a central vine that climbs up, up, disappearing into the misty heights. I try to ask someone for directions, but their words are musical notes instead of speech, fluttering away into the air, leaving lines of color in their wake.

Somehow, my feet decide for me, carrying me through an archway where gravity loosens its grip and I seem to float upwards along a path made of crystalline stepping stones. Shadows of old memories flit alongside me, unseen companions leading the way. In a garden of mechanical birds and hourglass trees, a girl in a coat stitched from moonlight hands me a folded piece of paper. On it is a map drawn in ink that changes shape even as I study it, always one turn ahead of where I am.

The city itself feels alive—breathing, watching, gently urging me onward. There is no fear now, only a pulsing anticipation, as if by getting lost I am finding something greater, something inevitable. The meeting, I realize, isn’t at a place but a moment, and as the great flower in the square wilts, scattering its seeds of time, I step forward into the heart of the dream, knowing I have arrived precisely when—and where—I am meant to be.
