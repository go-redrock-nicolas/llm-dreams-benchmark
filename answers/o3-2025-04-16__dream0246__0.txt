I am dreaming. …feel a slow-motion lurch, as though the entire mountain has inhaled and is holding its breath. A crystalline hush settles over the slope: no birds, no wind, only the distant, muffled creak of pressure building inside the snowpack. Your boots sink half an inch, then another. Hairline cracks spiderweb outward—sketching a jagged geometry that glitters in pale winter light.

Suddenly the surface fractures with a sound like tearing silk amplified through a canyon. The mountainside releases a sigh that turns into a roar, and the earth beneath drops away. You’re no longer standing—you are weightless, suspended in a slow tumble of cold starlight and powdered diamonds. For an instant, time dilates: you can count every swirling snowflake illuminated by the sun’s low amber glow, each particle spinning like a galaxy in miniature.

Then the slope accelerates. White thunder envelops you, a rolling wall that devours trees, swallows sound, and blurs horizon from sky. You glimpse splintered trunks corkscrewing past, stripped of branches, soaring like thrown spears. Somewhere in the blur, a pine sapling bends, then whips upright, flinging a halo of snow crystals that sparkle neon-green—your dream adds impossible colors, aurora hues glowing inside the chaos.

You plunge beneath the surface into a dim, turquoise twilight. Snow presses from every angle—soft yet unyielding, like frozen velvet. Gravity loses meaning; up and down trade places. You’re turning end over end inside a stormy snow-cloud womb. There is a heartbeat—maybe your own, maybe the mountain’s—thudding in your ears. Your chest tightens, lungs burning to sip the thin, icy air that trickles through a fistful of powder.

But in dreams, panic can pivot to wonder. Your fear melts into astonishment: the avalanche becomes an under-sea current, and you are scuba-diving through sky-blue drifts. You swim, not struggle, kicking gently, carving tunnels that glow from within. Phosphorescent snowflakes spiral away like fireflies. Ahead, a cavern opens—an impossible crystal cathedral sculpted by wind and gravity. Sunbeams lance through fissures overhead, refracted into prismatic waterfalls that dapple the frozen pews in shifting rainbows.

Hovering in the nave is a silent bell made of rime-ice, delicate as spun sugar. You reach out; it rings without touch, a resonant tone that harmonizes with the mountain’s bass rumble. Sound becomes visible—waves pulse through the air as ripples of silver silk, brushing your face, tasting of frost and ozone.

Now the avalanche slows, as if soothed by the bell’s note. Snow settles into feather-soft dunes that cradle you gently. Gravity reasserts itself, but less harshly this time, as though the world has become a moonlit dreamscape with lighter rules. You stand, unburied, atop a plateau of freshly fallen snow that stretches toward infinity: a blank canvas awaiting your footprints. The sky above is lavender, streaked with fiery ribbons of magenta aurora that spell half-remembered words. Stars drip like molten glass, and each drop that lands blossoms into a glassy lotus, radiating warmth in the frozen air.

Behind you, the mountain—no longer menacing—wears a new, glistening cloak. The scars of the slide form elegant terraces, terraces that hum with latent energy, as if the earth has been rewritten into music. An iridescent fox trots along one of the terraces, its fur shifting through constellations. It pauses, meets your eyes, and nods—as if acknowledging a secret you’ve both known forever.

The dream thins around the edges, bleeding sunlight. Snowflakes lift off the ground in reverse, soaring skyward, returning to the clouds that birthed them. Gravity wavers; you feel yourself floating again, this time ascent rather than descent. The world below becomes a patchwork quilt of shining ice and violet shadow. You pass through the aurora curtains—soft, electric veils that tingle across your skin like playful static—and emerge into a place beyond weather, beyond cold, beyond fear.

Everything fades into luminous white. The silence is complete, a restful hush promising renewal. You inhale, tasting pure light, and wake—heart still echoing with the bell’s crystalline chime, skin tingling with phantom snow, mind alight with the impossible colors of an avalanche’s secret cathedral.
