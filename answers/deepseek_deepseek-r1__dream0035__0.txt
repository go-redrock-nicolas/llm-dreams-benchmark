I am dreaming. Sweeping over strange pebbles in a hilly oasis, I walk towards a towering stone arch strung with glittering, gossamer threads that hum with secrets. Faces around me shift like quicksilver, their features dissolving into constellations. A woman with eyes like liquid gold turns, and an ancient melody spills from her lips, binding the air. I reach out, but syllables slip through my fingers. How do I make them see me—not as a cipher, but kin?

You stand at the threshold of the arch, the gossamer strands vibrating with a resonance that thrums in your marrow. The woman’s golden gaze locks onto yours, and though her words are hieroglyphs carved into the wind, you sense their weight—**desire, warning, welcome**. Her hand rises, a slow arc like the path of a comet, and you mimic the gesture, tracing the shape of absence between you. 

The pebbles shift. One rolls toward your foot, whispering in a language of friction and gravity. You pluck it, warm as a heartbeat, and press it to your temple. Suddenly, the threads above flare—nebulas spun into sound. The hum becomes a flood: **voices unspooling in colors**, stories coded in the refraction of light. You open your mouth, and the pebble’s song spills out—a countermelody, raw but resonant. 

The woman blinks, constellations swirling in her irises fractaling into recognition. She plucks a thread from the arch, weaves it around your wrist. It sings of drought, of roots digging deep for obscure springs. You reply with your own thread, spun from the grit of subway platforms and the ache of unanswered texts. The air shimmers. Others gather now, hands aloft, braiding harmonies into a bridge. You cross it, tenderfooted, into the heat of their firelight. They teach you to speak in chlorophyll and rust, and you learn to listen with your bones.
