I am dreaming. As I wander through the winding streets of a foreign city, the scent of exotic spices and fresh bread wafts through the air, enticing my senses and drawing me deeper into the heart of this enchanting land. The warm sunlight casts a golden glow on the ancient architecture, and the sound of lively chatter and laughter fills the air, creating a sense of vibrant energy that is simply infectious. I am a traveler, a wanderer, and this country has captivated me with its rich history, stunning landscapes, and warm hospitality.

But, as I turn a corner, the atmosphere begins to shift, like the gentle lapping of waves on a tranquil shore that suddenly gives way to a raging storm. The sounds of laughter and conversation start to fade, replaced by the murmur of concern and the rustling of newspapers being hastily grabbed from street vendors. I see people gathering in small clusters, their faces etched with worry and uncertainty, as they whisper to each other in hushed tones. The air is electric with tension, and I can feel my anxiety rising, like a slow-building hum in the background of my mind.

As I continue to explore the city, I notice that the streets are becoming increasingly empty, and the few people I see are hurrying to and fro, their eyes fixed on the pavement or their phones, as if searching for some urgent news or message. The sound of sirens pierces the air, and I see police cars and military vehicles racing through the streets, their lights flashing and horns blaring. The city, once so full of life and energy, is rapidly descending into chaos.

Suddenly, I hear the sound of loudspeakers blaring, and a voice, stern and authoritative, announces that the borders are closing, effective immediately. The words send a shiver down my spine, and I feel a wave of panic wash over me. I am a foreigner, a stranger in a strange land, and the thought of being trapped, with no clear way to communicate with the outside world, is terrifying.

As I scan my surroundings, I notice that the streets are quickly filling with people, all rushing to get to... somewhere. Some are carrying luggage, while others are clutching their passports and phones, their faces etched with desperation. I join the crowd, swept up in the tide of humanity, as we all surge towards the city's central square. The air is thick with the smell of smoke and fear, and I can feel the weight of uncertainty bearing down on me.

In the midst of this chaos, I spot a small, unassuming door, tucked away between two larger buildings. The door is old and worn, with a small sign that reads "Café Évasion" in elegant, cursive script. Without hesitation, I push open the door and slip inside, seeking refuge from the turmoil that rages on outside.

As I enter the café, I am enveloped in a warm, golden light, and the sounds of the chaos outside fade away, replaced by the gentle hum of conversation and the soft clinking of cups. The café is a tiny, intimate space, filled with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the soft glow of candles. I take a seat at a small table, and a kindly old man, with a warm smile and a twinkle in his eye, greets me with a gentle nod.

"Welcome, my friend," he says, his voice low and soothing. "You are safe here. For now, at least, you are safe."

As I sit there, sipping a steaming cup of coffee, and listening to the old man's words of wisdom, I start to feel a sense of calm wash over me. The uncertainty and fear that gripped me outside begin to recede, replaced by a sense of wonder and curiosity. What will happen next? Will I find a way to escape, or will I be trapped in this enchanting, yet troubled, land? The dream is far from over, and I am eager to see where it will take me next.
