I am dreaming. # Perseverance's Echo

I've endured repeated setbacks while pursuing an important goal. After this latest obstacle, I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, impossibly deep canyon. The walls shimmer with veins of luminescent minerals that pulse like slow heartbeats. The air feels charged, almost alive against my skin.

My goal—a floating citadel of ancient knowledge—hovers tantalizingly on the opposite side, suspended in midair by forces I don't understand. Its crystal spires catch the light of two setting suns, fracturing the rays into rainbow cascades that pour down its sides.

The bridge I'd spent months constructing lies in ruins below, shattered by a sudden storm that seemed to target only my creation. My hands still ache from the work, callused and raw. My third attempt, destroyed like the others.

As despair threatens to overwhelm me, I notice something strange—a small bird with feathers that shift colors with each movement, watching me intently from a nearby rock. It tilts its head and suddenly speaks in the voice of my childhood mentor:

"The canyon is not meant to be crossed. It is meant to be descended."

Looking down, I see what I missed before—the luminescent veins form a spiraling staircase, invisible unless viewed from exactly this angle of defeat. The path has always been there, revealed only after I exhausted all conventional solutions.

With renewed determination, I take my first step downward, and the canyon begins to sing.
