I am dreaming. —I’m hustled through a maze of velvet curtains and gold-scalloped corridors, the thrum of the crowd a distant thunder echoing behind the heavy proscenium. Backstage, everything smells of hairspray, nervous perfume, and brassy anticipation. A frantic stagehand with star-shaped sequins dusted across her cheeks seizes my wrist. "You’re on," she gasps, eyes wild as a rabbit’s. Before I can protest, a feathered cloak is flung around my shoulders, and flashbulb memories of the legendary performer I am to replace strobe through my mind—her high notes like comet trails, the signature step-kick-spin that redefined the stage, the way her laughter rolled over the balconies like summer wind.

My heart tap-dances in my chest as the stage manager shoves a microphone into my hand. "Trust the magic," he whispers, fingertips humming with static, and then I’m blinking in the fierce white of center stage, a thousand faces painted with hope gazing up at me. 

Spotlights crisscross, dazzling, as if searching for my confidence up in the gridwork. The orchestra dips, waiting for my signal. I close my eyes, and in the hush of anticipation, it happens: the cloak tightens into butterfly wings around my shoulders, and I feel centuries of stardust infuse my veins. My voice, uncertain at first, spills out in a warm, golden honey, threading through the expectant silence like silk. 

The music swells—a living river. I twirl, drink in the adoration of the crowd, and as if guided by an invisible hand, my body moves with impossible grace: a pirouette stolen from the prima ballerina, a wink that cracks open the laughter of the late-night comedian, a rafter-shaking note that belongs not to me but to legends who have haunted these boards. I become a prism, refracting the collective dreams of everyone who’s come before me, everyone who sits enraptured before me now.

Thunderous applause rises, rolling over me in a wave. It is joy, it is terror, it is every triumph and trembling moment all at once. I bow low, feathers sweeping the stage, and know that for one brilliant, impossible night, I have become the legend they needed.

As the curtains fall, I hear the clanging silence that comes after ferocious applause—and I awaken, heart soaring, knowing I dared to dance in the stardust-shadow of greatness.
