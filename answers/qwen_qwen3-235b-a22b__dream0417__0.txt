I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, suffocating city cloaked in the violet haze of a dual-mooned sky. The streets tumble in spirals so steep they might fall into themselves. Towering buildings writhe like watched snakes, their surfaces pulsing with veiny textures and eyes that blink slowly on occasion. This place remembers me. Perhaps it hates me.

Beside me stands a man I loathe. Or maybe I want to love him. Perhaps that is the confusion that festers — that writhes beneath the surface of the skin like a tick. He wears a suit stitched with shards of glass, which refract his face into disturbing angles every time he moves near the flickering street lamps. His name is Avrell, or maybe that's just the name this dream chose for him. He grates at me like sand in my teeth. Every word that leaves his mouth curls into smoke that smells of burnt books and mother's milk.

We are building something – though God only knows what. Our task is unclear, but wildly urgent. When we work together, strange things happen: metal covers itself in feathers, water runs uphill making whimpering noises, and time fractures in tiny, blinking bursts. It’s almost beautiful. Almost.

But the tension is a thorn lodged deep in my ribs. There’s no name for what he is to me in this place — a lover perhaps, or an enemy dressed like one. Or a brother who dreams of my demise between prayers. He challenges me with every breath. When he glances at me, his eyes flicker with centuries of accusation, moments I've never lived, but which somehow *hurt*. We touch and the air hisses. Our hands recoil like burned wood.

“Let’s be finished,” he murmurs, voice slick with both venom and terrible longing.  
I cannot tell if he wishes to kill our creation or kiss it alive.

A terrible machine rises behind us — part clock, part cathedral, part broken ship. It leaks oil that stains the ground like inkblots. This must be our work. I wonder what will happen when it's finally turned on. I wonder if it will reveal who I am to him, or if it will swallow all of this world in a breathless gasp.

We are not equals, yet the dream binds us in meshed chains. he speaks riddles in a forgotten tongue that I somehow understand in fragments: *“We died together, once, in a city of salt.”*  
I did not love him then. Perhaps I did. All I know is this — I want to finish what we started, even though every bolt I tighten feels like sealing my own casket.

And in the far distance, a ghostly choir begins to sing, harmonizing with the beating of my own distant heart. I am afraid.

Still, I reach for the wrench.

Still, I begin again.
