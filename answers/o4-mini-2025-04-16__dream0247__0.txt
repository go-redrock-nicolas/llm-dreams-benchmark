I am dreaming. I drift through a forest of mist-draped moonflowers whose petals unfold like soft wings. Every step I take leaves a ripple of pale starlight across damp soil, and the air hums with a thousand silent lullabies. In the distance, a library of living oak trees arches overhead—its branches woven into shelves of memories. I wander beneath them, fingertips brushing against bark that pulses with forgotten voices.  

There, in the hushed glow of bioluminescent moss, I uncover a tome bound in translucent glass. Its title shimmers: “The Story We Gave You.” As I crack it open, portraits of my ancestors float free—each face a constellation of smiles and tears. But the words inside tell another tale: that my history was carefully spun, a tapestry of half-truths designed to shelter me from a dark legacy. I learn that long ago, my family bargained with a sorrow so immense they wrapped it in fiction, hoping I would never shoulder its weight.  

A soft sadness tugs at me, but instead of panic or shame, I feel a clear bell of calm ring deep in my chest. I close the glass book, and the forest around me shifts: the moonflowers fold back into shadow, revealing a lantern-lit path lined with glass orbs. Each orb contains a fragment of reality—a flash of a hidden village swallowed by a storm, the lull of lullabies turned anxious, the hush of farewell letters never sent. I reach out, and as my fingers touch the cool sphere, its scene unfurls into mist, then dissolves entirely.  

With steady breath, I step forward. A pale hummingbird the size of my hand alights on my shoulder, its wingbeats stirring petals of moonlight. It guides me into a clearing where a mirror stands on slender legs, its silver surface rippling. I bend and peer in—and see not my face, but layers of myself: the child who trusted every bedtime story, the teenager who sensed cracks in the narrative, the adult who now understands the gentle artifice erected by love and fear.  

I inhale the hush of that revelation and exhale any lingering hurt. The mirror’s ripples calm, and in its stillness I glimpse the roots of an older truth: compassion. My family’s unspoken vow to protect me may have been imperfect, but it sprang from the desire to spare my heart from a burdensome grief. Now, awake in this dream, I hold both halves of the story—what was given and what was hidden—and feel an unbreakable thread of empathy knitting them together.  

As the forest dissolves into dawn’s first silver rays, I hover between sleep and waking, carrying with me the balanced quietude of one who has seen both shelter and shadow—and who, despite it all, remains whole.
