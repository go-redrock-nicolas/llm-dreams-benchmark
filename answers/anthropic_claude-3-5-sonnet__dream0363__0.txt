I am dreaming. I find myself in a glass-walled room atop a skyscraper, the cityscape stretching endlessly below like a circuit board of twinkling lights. The air feels unusually thick, almost syrupy, and there's a persistent hum that seems to vibrate through my bones. I'm in a business meeting, faces around the table blurring and morphing like melting wax, when suddenly the coffee cup in my hand begins to boil without heat.

The suppressed anger rises like magma, starting in my chest and spreading through my limbs. The glass walls of the room begin to ripple in sync with my heartbeat, and I notice my reflection shows my skin turning a deep, iridescent purple. Words I've held back for months start floating around the room in physical form - glowing, sharp-edged letters that cut through the air like knives.

The other people in the room continue their meaningless conversation, their voices now sounding like distant wind chimes, completely oblivious to my transformation. I try to speak, but instead of words, streams of red butterflies burst from my mouth, each one carrying a fragment of my long-suppressed truth. The butterflies swarm around the room, their wings leaving trails of ember-like light.

As my anger peaks, the glass walls shatter - but instead of falling, the shards hang suspended in the air, each one reflecting a different memory of what led to this moment. I watch as these memories play out simultaneously, like a fractured movie screen showing dozens of interconnected scenes.

Then, in a sudden shift, the suspended glass shards transform into drops of rain, each one falling upward into a storm-dark sky. As they rise, they carry away pieces of my anger, transforming the heavy, hot feeling in my chest into something lighter, more manageable. I feel myself floating upward with the rain, through layers of clouds that taste like mint and stone, until I reach a place where the air is thin and clear, and I can finally breathe again.

The dream ends with me watching the purple fade from my skin, replaced by patterns of gentle light, while the last of the red butterflies dissolves into the dawn-colored sky, leaving behind a sense of release and renewal.
