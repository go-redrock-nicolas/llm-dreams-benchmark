I am dreaming.

I awaken to solemn, crystalline silence. My bedroom, bare of the familiar glow of phone screens and blinking lights, feels ancient—haunted, almost, by the absence of whirs and hums. Outside, the city breathes in uneasy hush; even the distant traffic has fallen mute, cars stranded and powerless as stone monuments. Above, the gray-pink dawn echoes with a rawness I’ve never heard: the clarity of birdsong, the metallic caw of a crow, the distant neigh of a horse—where did that horse come from?

The realization settles over me like a thick woolen cloak: every electrical device, every humming gadget, every shivering circuit has fallen silent. My phone is a sleek black paperweight. My laptop—useless. The refrigerator is rapidly losing its cool, and the lamp at my bedside is nothing but an ornamental sculpture.

I step into the hallway, and the stairwell is cluttered with neighbors in rumpled pajamas, faces tense with a mixture of awe and terror. We gather, wordless for a beat, our eyes searching each other for answers. Down on the street, the scene is a patchwork chaos: men and women unmoored from their routines, trickling from apartment buildings, some grasping transistor radios that emit only static, others dragging bicycles from storage, dusting off forgotten skateboards, sharing wary nods. The city blocks are woven with the bright, mad jangle of human voices—shaken, searching, alive with something strangely hopeful.

At the corner, a bakery opens its doors, the owner waving loaves with flour-dusted hands, calling for people to take what they need. A group begins chalking news updates on the sidewalk in wild, looping letters—reports gathered from face-to-face conversations, words spreading like wildfire. Traffic lights are dead, but people move with courteous chaos, waving each other on or cooperatively hauling stalled vehicles to the curb.

As the days pass in the dream, we rediscover what is lost and what cannot be replaced: the pleasure of shared work, the exhilaration of hands-on creation. Night brings darkness, a velvet drape dotted with brilliant, unfamiliar constellations unmasked by vanished city lights. We build bonfires in parks and fill the air with stories—old tales reborn, myths retold, plans forged by flame’s flicker. Trades emerge: bakers for carpenters, teachers for healers. Gardens burst into life in parking lots. Laughter and grief collide in communal kitchens.

With no hum, no screen, no instant connection but the press of warm hands, society is stripped bare, then woven again, thread by rugged thread. My dream-self is both terrified and exhilarated, swept along by the current of invention and resilience, discovering in this world without power, the far deeper current of human power—the kind that moves unseen, felt only by its imprint on the heart.
