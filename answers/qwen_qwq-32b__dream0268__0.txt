I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth, a scent that tugs at my memory even as it eludes me. I stand at the edge of a bridge suspended over a river of liquid silver, its surface shimmering with an eerie, unearthly glow. The water flows upward, defying gravity, its path arcing into a starless night sky. I can hear laughter—the sound familiar yet distorted, as though filtered through water. It's the laughter of someone I once knew intimately, a presence that haunts the edges of my thoughts without fully materializing. 

Before me, the bridge stretches into an impossible geometry, its structure shifting and warping like a living thing. Each step forward triggers a dissonant chime, and the faintest outlines of shadowy figures emerge from the silver river below. Their forms contort into shapes that shift between human and animal, their whispers weaving a tapestry of disjointed truths. They recount scenes I vaguely recognize but can’t anchor in certainty—a rooftop fire under a blood-red moon, a hand clutching a cracked teacup in twilight, a door with no handle swinging open to a void. 

The bridge twists further, reality bending until I confront a mirror made of liquid mercury. Gazing into it, I see not my reflection, but a gallery of possible selves: a version of me dancing in a field of neon flowers, another submerged underwater breathing effortlessly, a third older, eyes lined with galaxies. Their voices blend into a chorus singing a melody I half-remember from a life unlived. 

Suddenly, the ground shivers. The bridge begins to dissolve, the silver river surging upward in torrent. The figures dissolve into constellations, the laughter now a chorus of static. I try to grasp a handrail, but my fingers pass through as if touching smoke. Awakening is imminent—it’s a sensation, not a sound. Just before the dream unravels, I catch a fleeting image: a small, silver key lodged in the heart of a black sun, glowing with the faintest pulse of recognition.
