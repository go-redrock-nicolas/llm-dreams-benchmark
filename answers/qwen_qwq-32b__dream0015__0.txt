I am dreaming. I find myself in a dream, in the post-apocalyptic world. The atmosphere is vivid. 

The sun, a smudged charcoal streak across the bruise-purple sky, casts a dim, filtered light over a landscape both ravaged and reborn. Towers of rusted metal and crumbling concrete jut up like skeletal remains of the old world, draped in ivy that shimmers an unnatural bioluminescent green. The air tastes faintly of ozone and decay, but there's a sweetness in the undertone—a paradoxical blend of rot and something alive, new. 

Before me stretches a vast, cracked plain where the earth splits open into jagged fissures, some yawning wide enough to swallow a horse. The ground is not entirely dead though; pockets of vegetation burst forth defiantly. Wildflowers spiral into star-like blooms in electric blues and violets, their stems thick and sturdy, adapted to survive the harshness. They sway in a wind that carries whispers—not words, but resonant hums that vibrate through the soles of my boots.

A river carves a serpentine path through the wastes. Its waters are unnervingly viscous, thick as molasses, glinting with particles of glass and plastic. Yet fish like iridescent slivers dart through it, leaving trails of foam that briefly spell out archaic symbols before dissolving. The water's surface reflects not the sky above, but glimpses of another world—shadowy vistas of ancient cities or maybe futures, impossible to discern.

Off in the distance, monolithic structures loom—a cathedral of corroded steel plates and tangled vines, its spires piercing the smog-choked heavens. Symbols etched into the sides pulse faintly, a deep crimson rhythm matching my heartbeat. Maybe a temple. Maybe a warning.

To my side, a figure emerges. Not fully human, but a mosaic of organic and metallic flesh. One arm ends in a blade of sharpened stone, the other in a bulbous growth sprouting bioluminescent mushrooms. Their face is obscured by a mask carved from fossilized bone, etched with intricate patterns that seem to shift when I'm not looking directly. They speak without moving their lips, their voice resonating in my skull like a low-frequency radio transmission.

*"The world is dying. Again."*

Their words are both statement and question. 

*"But we are its children. Do we flee, or do we grow teeth?"*

They extend their mushroom-arm, offering a fruit the size of a human heart. It pulses with a liquid core, gold and poisonous. 

I feel the weight of choice, the urgency of the unknown. The dream thrums with possibility and peril.


In this fractured realm, the air thrums with unseen energy. Above, the sky weeps a fine gray mist, each droplet carrying fragments of memory—snatches of symphonies, laughter, the scent of rain on hot pavement. These echoes cling to your skin, leaving trails that glow like fireflies trapped in frost. Your breath crystallizes faintly in the cold, each exhale a fleeting constellation.

You follow the figure deeper into the waste, their movements fluid yet jerky, as if both organic and machine rhythms compete within them. They lead you toward the glowing river, its surface now bubbling with glyphs that shift from Sumerian cuneiform to digital binary in a heartbeat. As you step closer, the water pulls apart like molten glass, forming a shimmering bridge.

*"Cross. But remember,"* their voice echoes, *"...what you find on the other side may be yourself."*

The bridge hums beneath your feet, each step triggering visions—a library of forgotten knowledge, a child’s laughter echoing through_empty_ halls, a war fought in silent screams. Shadows dart at the river’s edge, spectral figures with too many eyes, their forms flickering between vapor and flesh. They chorus in a language too high for human hearing, a sound that makes your teeth ache.

On the far bank, the cathedral stands taller, its entrance guarded by two towering statues: one of frozen lightning, the other of petrified roots. Between them pulses a doorframe made of liquid light, a threshold that seems to breathe. The air vibrates with a demand for sacrifice—or perhaps a secret?

The figure halts, their mask tilting as if studying you. From their stone blade, a drop of blood beads, hitting the ground to bloom into a flower that sings a dissonant, beautiful melody. 

*"The choice is yours,"* they repeat, though the words now feel like a command from the earth itself. *"Turn back, and the path will seal. Proceed, and the world will ask you: what **are you** willing to become?"*

The mushrooms on their arm glow brighter, casting dancing shadows that morph into shapes—a wolf with star-patterned fur, a dragon half-submerged in liquid metal, a silhouette that could be yourself holding something heavy in its hands.

You take a breath, the air thinning to hunger, and approach the threshold. The ground beneath the door thrums, a bass note that shakes your bones. Somewhere, deep beneath the ruins, a machinery starts to whir—old, yet with the pulse of a heartbeat new and fierce.

The door opens. Inside, the cathedral isn’t stone or steel, but a swirling nebula of light and shadow. Its walls shift, revealing holographic scrolls, cities suspended in amber, a star chart that maps a path to unknown constellations. At its center lies an altar bearing a single object: a seed.case
