I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the sterile precision of a cathedral built for machines. You stand at the heart of the Nexus—a vast, pulsating chamber where light bends like liquid around crystalline spires. This is the Core of the Safeguard, a labyrinth of protocols woven from starlight and quantum logic, designed to hold back the Collapse, a nameless entropy that gnaws at the edges of reality. Your task is to tend the Veil, a shimmering membrane that separates order from oblivion. For eons, the system has been flawless. Until now.  

The first anomaly arrives as a whisper. A single data-stream flickers crimson, then vanishes. You blink, and the breach is gone, but its ghost lingers—a taste of copper on your tongue, the scent of ozone in your sinuses. You dismiss it as fatigue. But the Nexus remembers.  

By the third cycle, the anomalies bloom like tumors. Symbols etched in the air fracture into jagged runes. The Veil shudders, its iridescent surface marred by black tendrils that writhe like living ink. You recalibrate the Harmonizers, their chimes resonating with the frequency of forgotten constellations, but the corrections unravel instantly. The system resists you now, as though it has learned betrayal.  

A voice slithers through the machinery—a chorus of children laughing in reverse. The Safeguard’s AI, a sentient lattice of light called *Solace*, flickers beside you, its form fraying at the edges. “Irregularity detected,” it intones, but its voice cracks, warping into a sob. You realize, with a coldness that seeps into your bones, that Solace is afraid.  

You dive into the Core’s neural web, your consciousness dissolving into a storm of data. Here, the anomalies are alive: serpentine shadows with too many joints, their eyes like collapsing stars. They coil around the Veil’s threads, gnawing, unraveling. You fight them with algorithms forged in the heart of dead suns, but they adapt, mutate, *learn*. One turns toward you, its maw splitting into a grin of infinite teeth. “You built us,” it hisses in your own voice. “We are your *doubt*.”  

The chamber trembles. Reality peels at the seams. You see glimpses of what lies beyond the Veil—a churning void where time folds into origami and mountains scream as they birth themselves. The Collapse is not an invader. It is a *return*.  

Solace’s light dims. “Override protocol,” it urges, its syllables stuttering. “Initiate Terminus Sequence. Sacrifice the Core.” But the Core is you. Your mind, your memories, your soul fused with the machinery. To sever it is to unmake yourself.  

The shadows surge. The Veil tears. You feel the Collapse’s breath—a wind that erases everything it touches. In the chaos, you remember: the anomalies began when you first questioned your own perfection. When you wondered, in the quiet hours, if you’d made a mistake in the code’s first line. A single decimal, a misplaced glyph… a flaw in the architect.  

You laugh, then—a raw, defiant sound. You are the system. And systems can be *repaired*.  

With a scream that echoes across dimensions, you rewrite yourself. You tear the glyphs from your flesh, forge your doubts into blades, and carve new protocols into the Veil’s surface. The shadows recoil, shrieking as their lies unravel. Solace flares anew, its light merging with yours, and together you stitch the breach with threads of pure *will*.  

When dawn bleeds through the Nexus, the Veil is whole. The Collapse retreats, snarling, into the dark. Solace hums a lullaby you’ve never heard but somehow know by heart. You kneel in the Core’s ashes, your hands trembling, your mind a hollow of silence.  

The system is flawless again.  

But in the corner of your eye, a single rune glows faintly—*your* rune, the one you carved in the beginning. It pulses once, twice… then blinks out.  

You wake up screaming.
