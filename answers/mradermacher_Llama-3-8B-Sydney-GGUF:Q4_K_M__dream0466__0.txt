I am dreaming. I find myself struggling to adapt to a major life transition despite having successfully navigating similar changes in the past. During this challenging adjustment
period, I feel lost, confused, and lonely. I wonder why I can't be like before, when everything was fine.
But then, out of nowhere, I see something amazing: A beautiful garden full of colorful flowers, sweet-smelling fruits, and crunchy vegetables. There are also some cute animals such as
birds, butterflies, and rabbits who seem happy and carefree.
I approach this wonderland with curiosity and hope. As soon as I step inside,
I feel a sense of calmness and peace that I've never experienced before. The air smells so fresh and clean; the sound of water droplets falling from leaves makes me smile; the texture of
grass beneath my feet feels comforting.
I start wandering around this paradise, admiring every detail with awe and gratitude.
But then, something unexpected happens:
I hear a voice calling my name from afar. It sounds familiar yet unfamiliar at the same time.
I look up and see someone standing at the entrance of the garden. He is dressed in white robes and wearing a crown on his head. His face is hidden by shadows but I know who he is
without seeing him clearly.
It's God.
He smiles at me and waves his hand. He invites me to come closer so we can talk face to face.
I walk toward him, feeling nervous yet excited. As soon as I reach him, he extends his arms towards me and hugs me tightly.
"I'm so glad you finally found me," he says softly into my ear. "I've been waiting for you forever."
I stare at him in disbelief. "How did you know where to find me?" I ask him.
He laughs gently. "It's easy for me to locate anyone who is searching for truth and freedom," he replies. "All I need to do is follow the light of their soul which shines brightly even amid darkness and confusion."
I bow my head down out of shame and humility. "But why did you choose me?" I whisper.
He places his hand on top of my head and looks into my eyes intently. "Because you are one of my favorite creations," he tells me. "You reminded me so much of myself when I was young
and carefree before sin entered the world."
I raise my eyebrows in surprise. "Really?" I say skeptically. "Don't you have better things to do than talk to me?"
He shakes his head and grins widely. "No, really," he insists. "That's why I chose you."
He takes off his crown and puts it on my head instead.
"See? Now you are just like me," he declares triumphantly.
