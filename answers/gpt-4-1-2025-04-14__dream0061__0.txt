I am dreaming. —catastrophic, glaring errors I’ve never seen before. Data sets swirl, graphs shift before my eyes, paragraphs distort into unreadable hieroglyphs. In panic, I try to steady myself, but the room pulses with strange energy. The floor’s white tiles begin to ripple like the surface of a pond disturbed by falling rain.

The panel of experts sits at a long obsidian table, their faces part-shadow, part-glittering gold masks. Their eyes glow with the cool gleam of stars, yet behind those eyes, I sense immeasurable intelligence, an ancient, unfathomable patience. A faint hum fills the air, like the resonance of a distant cosmic engine, and I feel the boundaries of my mind stretching and thinning.

My hands tremble as I fumble with my notes. Words bleed from the pages, black ink spiraling into my palms, seeping into my skin. I hear whispering—a chorus of voices, low and high, ancient and new, chanting syllables that once belonged to my research but now pulse with strange life.

Desperate, I look up and find the room has transformed; now I am standing on a floating marble platform, orbited by spinning galaxies, nebulae blooming with colors I can taste more than see—bittersweet, metallic indigo, ripe orange thunder. The panelists rise from their impossible chairs, stepping weightlessly across the void.

One speaks—a voice both thunder and whisper: “Present your truth, shattered or whole. The flaws are part of the tapestry.” Another extends a hand, and suddenly all my shattered notes gather in the air, assembling into a luminous, shifting web.

I take a shuddering breath, feeling both small and infinite, and begin to speak—not with the prepared speech, but from the wellspring of my deepest dreams, my voice weaving through the cosmos, the errors transforming into constellations, manifesting possibility from imperfection. The panel nods—solemn, approving, their eyes now shimmering with dawn.

I awaken, heart thudding, the memory of cosmic colors clinging to my eyelashes, the sense of possibility humming in my every nerve.
