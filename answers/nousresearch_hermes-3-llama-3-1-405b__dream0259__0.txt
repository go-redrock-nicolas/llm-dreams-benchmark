I am dreaming. I find myself standing before an ancient stone portal, its surface overgrown with creeping vines and etched with mysterious glyphs.  The air is thick and heavy, charged with an otherworldly energy that makes my skin tingle and my hair stand on end.  

As I reach out to touch the portal, a brilliant white light erupts from its surface, blinding me momentarily. Blinking away the stars, I see the portal now stands open, revealing a lush, verdant landscape beyond.  Hesitantly, I step through.

On the other side, I find myself in a fantastical realm, a place of myth and magic.  Majestic mountains rise in the distance, their snow-capped peaks kissing the clouds above.  Nestled in the valley below, an azure lake glimmers in the late afternoon sun, its tranquil waters disturbed only by the occasional ripple from a leaping fish or flitting water insect.

Drawing closer, I see the lake is fed by a cascade of water tumbling down the hillside, originating from a spring that bubbles up from deep within the earth, crystal clear and cool.  The rocks around the spring are covered in soft, velvety moss in various shades of green, dotted with tiny white flowers that release a sweet, heady fragrance into the air.

As I kneel to cup my hands and drink from the spring, I catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of my eye.  Turning, I see the branches of a nearby tree rustling, as if something is moving within.  Slowly, cautiously, I approach the tree, my heart pounding in anticipation.

Reaching out, I part the branches to reveal...a beautiful unicorn, its coat gleaming like molten silver, its horn a twist of opalescent pearl.  We gaze at each other for a long moment, the unicorn's liquid amber eyes seeming to peer into my very soul.  Then, with a snort and a toss of its mane, it turns and bounds away, disappearing into the forest.

Awestruck, I continue my exploration, wandering along a winding dirt path dappled with sunlight filtering through the trees.  The air is alive with the sound of birdsong, the gentle drone of insects, and the whisper of the wind through the leaves overhead.  A sense of peace and contentment pervades my being; I could happily spend eternity in this enchanting place.

Eventually, the path leads me to a small clearing, where a cozy thatched-roof cottage sits, smoke curling invitingly from its chimney.  The door stands open, and the tantalizing aroma of freshly-baked bread wafts out to greet me.  Unable to resist, I step inside.

The interior of the cottage is warm and inviting, with rough-hewn wooden furniture, a cheerfully blazing hearth, and bunches of drying herbs and flowers hanging from the beams overhead.  Seated at the table is an old woman, her face weathered and lined but her eyes bright and lively.  She gestures for me to sit, and I do, feeling instantly at ease in her presence.

Pouring me a mug of fragrant tea, the old woman proceeds to regale me with incredible tales - of heroes and quests, of uncharted lands, of love won and lost.  I listen raptly, the rest of the world fading away until nothing remains but her voice and the crackle of the fire.  Time seems to stand still; I have no idea how long I sit there, entranced by her stories.

Finally, reluctantly, I rise to take my leave.  The old woman presses a small, cloth-wrapped bundle into my hands, her final words echoing in my mind: "Everything you need lies within."  

Clutching my mysterious gift, I step out of the cottage...and find myself back in the mundane world.  The dream is over, but the sense of wonder and magic it has imparted will remain forever.  Such is the power of the mind's unbridled imaginings.
