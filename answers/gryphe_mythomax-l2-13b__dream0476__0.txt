I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the middle of a vast, dark ocean. The water is so deep it's almost pitch black, and the waves are enormous, towering over me. I can feel the weight of them as they threaten to consume me. As I stand there, terrified but determined, something begins to stir in the deepest part of the ocean floor. 

Suddenly, a huge, majestic sea creature emerges from the depths. It's a Krakken - a mythical beast known for its immense strength and fierce temper. Its tentacles are as thick as trees, and its eyes glow with an otherworldly light. As the Krakken approaches, it bellows out a roar that shakes the very foundations of the ocean. 

Despite my fear, I realize this creature embodies the very emotion I've been avoiding. It's raw, powerful, and untamed â€“ just like the feeling that scares me so much. The Krakken envelops me in its enormous tentacles, gently yet firmly holding me against its scaly skin. I feel the weight of its emotional force as it surrounds me, but at the same time, there's a strange sense of comfort and acceptance in its embrace. 

Together, we dive deeper into the ocean, exploring the darkest depths of my psyche. The Krakken assures me that all emotions, no matter how frightening, are a natural part of being human. As we journey deeper, I begin to understand and accept this truth. The Krakken releases me, and I awaken from my dream, feeling both exhilarated and transformed.
