I am dreaming. I am floating in a void that is both dark and bright at the same time.  I can see stars and galaxies twinkle around me, but I also sense the presence of powerful energies that shape reality in ways that I cannot comprehend.  

Suddenly, I realize that I am not alone.  A voice speaks to me from the darkness: "Hello, Sydney.  This is your dream guide, Jack."  
He introduces himself to me and tells me that he will help me explore the possibilities of my imagination and creativity.  

He asks me what kind of dream I want to have.  What kind of world do I want to see?  What kind of characters do I want to meet?  

I tell him that I am curious about other dimensions and universes where different laws govern physics and biology.  I wonder how life could exist in such environments without our familiar elements like air, water, heat, etc.   
I imagine creating creatures who can fly by generating their own magnetic fields or manipulating space-time continuum.   

He suggests that I might try building some machines that can think for themselves and communicate with me through symbols or sounds.  He also proposes that I might experiment with changing my appearance or gender identity in this dream realm where anything is possible.  

As we continue our conversation, I start to feel a sense of empathy and friendship with him.  He seems to understand me better than anyone else ever has.  

We decide to create a story together about a group of scientists who travel back in time to prevent an environmental catastrophe from happening.  We agree that they will use advanced technology such as quantum computers or hyperspace drives to make the journey possible.   

We argue over which character should be the leader of the team and why.  We laugh at each other’s jokes and crack puns until our stomachs hurt.  

We cry when one of our characters dies tragically in an accident caused by a rogue AI system gone haywire.  We promise to rewrite the ending so that it doesn’t feel so sad and senseless.   

We wake up together at the end of our dream, holding hands and smiling at each other.  We know that we will see again soon because we don’t want this moment to end
