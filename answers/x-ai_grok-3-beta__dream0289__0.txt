I am dreaming. find myself standing alone on the edge of a vast, ethereal landscape, where the sky shimmers with hues of deep violet and molten gold, as though the heavens themselves are weeping for my loss. The air feels heavy, laden with an unspoken sorrow that mirrors the ache in my chest. Beneath my feet, the ground is a mosaic of fractured glass, reflecting distorted fragments of memories—each shard a piercing reminder of what I’ve lost. It is a person, someone so integral to my being that their absence feels like a hollow cavern carved into my soul. 

I walk forward, driven by an unseen force, my bare feet crunching against the glassy fragments, though they do not cut me. Instead, each step releases a faint, mournful hum, a chorus of whispers that echo the name of the one I’ve lost. The horizon ahead is obscured by a swirling mist, thick and silvery, curling around me like tendrils of forgotten dreams. As I push through it, the mist parts to reveal a towering willow tree, its branches drooping as if burdened by grief. Its bark pulses faintly, almost like a heartbeat, and I’m drawn to it, compelled to press my trembling hand against its rough surface.

The moment I touch the tree, a surge of warmth rushes through me, and the world around me transforms. The glassy ground dissolves into a sea of soft, emerald moss, and the violet sky brightens into a delicate lavender, streaked with ribbons of dawn. From the willow’s branches, glowing orbs of light descend, hovering around me like fireflies. Each orb begins to hum, their collective song weaving into a melody I recognize—a lullaby once sung by the person I’ve lost. Tears stream down my face, but they are not solely of pain; there’s a strange, bittersweet comfort in this reunion of sound and spirit.

Suddenly, one of the orbs floats closer, expanding into a translucent figure—a silhouette of the one I mourn. Their face is blurred, as dreams often veil such details, but their presence is unmistakable. I reach out, desperate to hold them, to anchor them to me once more, but my fingers pass through the shimmering form. Yet, they do not recoil. Instead, their voice, soft as a breeze, wraps around me, whispering, “I am not gone, only changed. Find me in the quiet places, in the spaces between heartbeats.” 

The words carve themselves into my mind, and as the figure dissolves back into light, the willow tree begins to bloom with flowers of radiant silver, each petal falling like a tear. The flowers drift toward me, and as they touch my skin, they dissolve into warmth, filling the hollow in my chest with something softer, something like hope. The landscape shifts again—the mist returns, but it is lighter now, guiding me toward a path lined with those same silver blooms, winding into an unseen distance.

I walk this path, feeling the weight of my loss transform, not disappearing, but becoming part of me in a new way. The air grows lighter, the whispers of sorrow now mingling with faint laughter, echoes of shared joy. I realize I am not walking away from my grief, but through it, toward a place where memory and healing entwined can coexist. The dream begins to fade here, the colors softening, the sounds dimming, but I carry with me the sensation of those silver petals and the quiet promise that even in loss, there is a thread of connection that endures.

As I drift toward wakefulness, the last image lingering is the willow tree, standing sentinel in that strange, sorrowful land, its branches now lifted slightly, as if to say farewell—not forever, but for now.
