I am dreaming. A cathedral of twilight looms overhead, its vaulted ceiling a mosaic of bruise-purple and molten gold, stitched with threads of burning silver. The dreamscape spreads out before me like a pageant torn from an ancient and forbidden grimoire. Towers of obsidian coil upward like petrified tornadoes, their crests dissolving into the sky in streams of ghostly smoke. The ground thrums beneath my bare feet, whispering in the tongue of rivers and earthquakes, and the air is thick with the low hum of something too vast to fully hear.

I stand in the center of a floating city, a place stitched between the stars and void—not quite real, not quite imagined. City squares shimmer with liquid light, roads paved from the dreams of forgotten gods. Dragons the color of storm clouds circle lazily above like thoughts too slow to be caught, and the trees bloom with eyes instead of blossoms, blinking in slow, drowsy comprehension.

I am a watcher. A dreamer. A herald.

And I *know*.

An unshakable weight presses down on the horizon—the foretelling of cataclysm. The hourglass in the sky has begun its spill, each grain a star plunging to its death. The end draws near, in a sodden, final breath—one hour before the city splinters, before Atlantis bleeds anew, before memory turns to ash and ash turns to song.

I run. Barefoot across the glass-like stones that sing at my touch—each note a warning arpeggio. My voice ricochets through the city’s marrow. I speak to the star-eyed people, murmuring in tongues that twist the air into ripples. I tell them that the hourglass is emptying, that time is bending inward like a black flower folding at dusk. The cataclysm will not be fire or flood. It will be *unraveling*, the undoing of what makes dream-world and waking world different. One reality will consume the other—no malice, only inevitability.

They smile at me with eyes of twilight and teeth of salt. They do not believe.

They dance in the city’s dream-squares, garlands of silence twirling from their fingers, their feet skimming across mirrors of time. “You mistake visions for truth,” they sing, their voices bees in crystalline hives. “Cataclysms are so very *alarmist.*”

I watch the sky-hourglass leak stars one by one.

Fifty minutes remain.

I climb to the edge of the precipice where the city ends and the sky forgets its name. There, the veil of the dream thins, and I can see beyond it, into reflections. Glimpses of the real world—warped and flickering, like faces beneath moving water. Streets teeming with hurried shadows, people who speak loudly of stocks and salaries, who do not stare at the sky and wonder. Myself among them, once again. My waking self. Distant. Unfeeling.

But here—at the edge—I *remember*. This dream is not merely some derangement of rest. It is a truth too many refuse to carry. So *I carry it alone*.

I sit beneath a thought-tree, its branches dropping fragments of prophecy that dissolve into smoke before they touch the ground. My hands are trembling; my breath shallow. But outwardly—my spine straight as an unsnapped lightning bolt, my gaze clear as the crater of forgotten comets. My composure is not calmness but a vow. I will watch. I will *remember*. I will witness the moment the world forgets how to hold itself together.

Forty minutes.

I close my eyes and see it—a tear in the fabric of the dream like space in the mouth of a ravenous god. The edges curl inward, fed upon by something unseen, beyond both plane and purpose.

I open my eyes and speak the Name that seals forgotten paths.

No one hears. Not yet.

Twenty minutes.

Still, people laugh too loudly beneath gossamer sigils that blink out like exhausted stars. Below me, the air begins to vibrate, not with fear, but with *absence*. A yawning gash appears in the sky—a tear that breathes rot and ozone. The reality beneath this dream starts to slough away.

Fifteen minutes.

The city flickers, just for a beat. A hiccup in the rhythm of the world—like a paused heart finding its tempo again. One man freezes mid-laugh. His eyes meet mine, and for just a moment, he *knows*. Then he blinks, and the knowledge drowns.

Ten minutes.

The silence begins first.

Even the trees stop whispering. The mirrored roads ripple like unsettled water. Somewhere, in a cathedral of bone and flame, a bell tolls once—and the echo never ends.

I rise, knowing that I will not see the end. Not this one.

But I will *remember* it in waking—for remembrance is the only resistance left. A fragment of truth imprisoned in emotion and nerve.

Five minutes.

My fingers are cold. The dream trembles. Reality, however strange, is breaking. The tears in the sky widen as if someone is unstitching this world, bead by bead, thought by thought.

One man finally sees me—on a bridge of wind and memory. He is soaked in nightmare ink. “You were real,” he whispers. “You were *right*.” But there’s nothing between us now but collapse.

I pray that in the unraveling, some piece of this world will survive within me.

Two minutes.

The sky shatters. Its shards hang in the air for a moment, poised like frozen butterflies, before vanishing into void.

The laughter is gone.

One minute.

I am the last.

Breath held.

I wait.

Watching the end of a world that no one believes in, and I do not flinch.

And then—

**I wake.**
