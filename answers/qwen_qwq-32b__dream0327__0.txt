I am dreaming. I step into an emerald valley where the air smells like rain and pine.  The sky is a canvas of swirls—sapphire and violet mixing like oil paints in a hurricane.  Flowers hum lullabies as I walk, their petals glowing like stained glass.  A river made of liquid starlight curves beside me, each ripple a captured constellation.  I pause when I hear a voice calling my name.  It's my mother, but she’s floating, her body translucent as if made of smoke and moonlight.  She holds out a hand, and where her fingers touch my cheek, I feel the weight of all the unspoken words between us.  "We never truly saw each other," she says, her voice echoing like wind through canyon walls.  "You thought I was strict; I thought you were ungrateful.  But we were both just afraid—to ask, to listen, to forgive."  The ground beneath my feet starts to dissolve into sand composed of forgotten memories.  I reach for her, but she fades, leaving only a single dandelion seed in my palm.  It’s glowing.  "Grow it," she whispers, "and see what roots beneath the surface."
