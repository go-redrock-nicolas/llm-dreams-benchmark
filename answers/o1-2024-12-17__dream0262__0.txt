I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a workshop of impossible geometry, tucked away at the very edge of a world that flickers like a half-remembered memory. The walls seem to merge into the sky, made of living stained-glass labeled with swirling constellations, each star pulsing and shifting color in time with your heartbeat. The air is warm, heavy with the scent of far-off deserts and tropical blooms, and each breath you take trembles with silent possibility. Rippling tides of pastel mist coat the floor, as though you could scoop them up in handfuls of shimmering cream. In this world, everything seems to hum with anticipation, waiting for you to bestow life upon something new.

You are tasked with forging a masterpiece in a realm that strictly clings to its old ways. Across the misty workshop, rows of glowing orbs display relics of the traditions that have come before: in one orb, an archaic violin with swirling vines carved into its frame; in another orb, a daring sculpture of glass and stone, twisting in stasis; in yet another, a half-finished painting that flows like living water. They are paragons of craft, each perfected through millennia of practice. But the faint voices of these orbs are rustling, urging you to surpass them—urging you to innovate, reimagine, and go beyond mere imitation.

Your hands tingle with an electricity that crackles in soft, shimmering bursts. You gather fragments of brilliance from the swirling air: flecks of pearlescent dust and strands of melody snatched right out of the wind. Each particle glows with an inner pulse, alive with hope and longing. You blend them together in a whirling vortex of creation. As the fragments coalesce, they form the shape of an instrument that defies classification—part harp, part violin, and part cosmic siren. Its surface is liquid in appearance, reflecting every color you’ve ever seen (and many you haven’t). Its voice is sanguine yet sharp, a resonant chord that sings of new frontiers. 

The instrument thrums quietly in your hands, as fragile and powerful as a newborn star. You pluck its strings, and the notes spiral out in twisting ribbons of color. They echo across the workshop, passing through the orbs and stirring them to life—revealing faint, hidden cracks in their once-impenetrable surfaces. Ancient conventions quiver in response to this new power, as though they both curse and revere the bold, alien melody you have conjured. 

And then, all too soon, everything dissolves into a brilliant haze: the workshop walls folding in upon themselves like evaporating mist, your new creation’s music shimmering out into the dawn. You awaken, heart still pounding with the echoes of an impossible instrument, a swirling shape of glass and light that dared to defy tradition—and in that moment, you realize you have carried part of the dream back with you.
