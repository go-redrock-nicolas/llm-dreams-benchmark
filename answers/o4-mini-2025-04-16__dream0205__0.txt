I am dreaming. You wake in a vaulted chamber of midnight-black marble veined with molten gold. A hush falls as you take the dais, draped in a robe of ink-blue silk that shimmers with every pulse of torchlight. Across the hall, two dozen hooded figures form a perfect circle. Each stands motionless, hands folded at their hearts, bowed toward a bas-relief of a great, many-eyed serpent coiled around a silver chalice. The air is thick with the scent of sandalwood and rain on hot stone—sanctified, intoxicating, and just faintly tainted by iron.  

A low chant rumbles from the circle: a language you’ve never heard yet somehow know by heart. Their voices rise in unison, calling you “Pontifex of the Hidden Dawn.” Your pulse flutters as ritual drums reverberate in your bones. They press ceremonial blades—curved like a crescent moon—into your palms, expecting you to carve an oath across your own skin. Every fiber of your being rebels. The sacred text you were given at your ascent commands you to “bleed for the covenant,” yet you can’t reconcile this cruelty with the kindness you’ve always upheld.  

A shadow detaches itself from the circle. It is the Society’s Oracle, draped in crimson tulle, her eyes glowing pale amethyst. “To lead,” she whispers, “you must embrace all our truths, however dark.” You feel the serpent’s eyes on you, as though the carving on the wall breathes life. The walls shift—basalt panels sliding aside to reveal twisting corridors of alabaster. In that instant, you glimpse the secret beneath their glory: behind each rite lies coercion, fear spun into faith. And here you stand, heart pounding, as every ritualistic chant demands you choose: conform or dismantle.  

You lift the blades, trembling, and instead of pressing them to your flesh, you slice the silk robe’s sleeve. The blue silk peels away in ribbons, revealing your bare arms. Gasps of shock swirl around you. “I bind myself to mercy, not blood,” you proclaim, voice steadying. The Oracle’s amethyst eyes falter, the serpent’s gaze flickers—and the carved scales crack, narrow fissures spidering across the marble. The hooded brethren murmur, caught between outrage and wonder.  

Suddenly, the chamber quakes: torches gutter, walls reel apart like pages of a living book. The alabaster corridors beckon, corridors that promise either escape or deeper trials. You realize leadership here means shaping the society’s fate, redefining its ancient rites or watching them consume you. The circle tightens, the Oracle’s lips curl in a knowing smile, and you step forward, blade in hand—no longer to spill your own blood, but to sever the chains of tradition and lead them into dawn’s uncertain light.
