I am dreaming. …close your eyes inside the dream and find yourself standing in the hollow ribcage of a colossal, sun-bleached leviathan, marooned on an endless salt flat the color of spilled moonlight. Wind sings through the bones like a cathedral organ, each note carrying echoes of the five lives you have painstakingly assembled and lost. Tattered banners—one woven from the letters of your first love, another stitched from the contracts of a bankrupt venture, another from hospital wristbands—flutter from each vertebra. They snap so loudly you mistake them for thunder.

Far on the horizon, a sixth storm is gathering: bruised violet clouds wheel together, threaded by veins of molten gold. With every pulse of lightning, fragments of your remaining world detach from the sky and plummet—childhood photographs, unfinished symphonies, the smell of coffee on a winter morning—shattering into glittering dust before they reach the ground. You feel the familiar pull of despair, a gravity you know too well, but something stirs beneath the salt: a heartbeat not your own.

You kneel and brush the crusted surface. Cracks spider outward, releasing a warm, vermilion glow. The salt floor softens into petals—millions of translucent, salt-rimmed rose petals—rising in a slow cyclone around you. Each petal bears a miniature scene: the moment you learned to ride a bike without training wheels, the day you first signed a lease, the instant you said “I forgive you” and meant it. The petals orbit faster and faster until they fuse into a living mural hovering in the air: a phoenix formed of your memories, radiant yet incomplete. Its wings are ragged; five times it has burned, five times it has flown again, and now it trembles at the prospect of another plunge into fire.

You whisper, “I don’t know if I can survive the sixth.”  

The phoenix cocks its head, revealing eyes that mirror your own, and beats a single, shuddering wing. Its feathers scatter like sparks and settle at your feet, transforming into six mismatched keys:

1. A key of river-smoothed jade, still dripping with the laughter of your childhood.
2. A key carved from splintered violin wood, vibrating with a music you never learned to play.
3. A key of blackened steel, heavy with the scent of factory smoke and overtime paychecks.
4. A key woven from telephone cords, buzzing with words both spoken and unsaid.
5. A key of cracked porcelain, cool as the hospital floor where you once waited for news that never came.
6. An unfinished key—half metal, half pure white light—its teeth unshaped, its handle unresolved.

You know instinctively that the first five can open memories already lived, but the half-forged sixth unlocks what has yet to exist.

Thunder booms. The storm breaches the edge of the salt flat, roaring like an ocean unleashed. The leviathan’s ribs quiver; banners tear free and spiral into the dark. You pocket the first five keys and clutch the sixth, its heat searing into your palm, branding a promise you cannot yet read.

Suddenly the salt below collapses, and you tumble into an underground atrium of colossal hourglasses. Some run with sand, others with ink, tears, or shimmering coins. A skeletal custodian—part librarian, part timekeeper—greets you with a slight bow. Its voice rustles like pages turning:

“You have toppled five hourglasses already. Each fell, and you rebuilt the glass with blood and hope. The sixth is fragile still—observe.”

It gestures to a towering hourglass suspended in chains. Inside, grains of stardust hang mid-air, neither falling nor rising. Your reflection gleams on the surface: eyes tired but unbroken, shoulders bearing invisible scars shaped like wings.

“Choose,” the custodian says. “Freeze this moment forever, or tip the glass and let the stars fall again.”

Your fingers tighten around the unfinished key. You know that freezing time—refusing change—would save you from more ruin, but would also entomb you in this half-lived fragment. Breathing deep, you step forward and place the hot, glowing key against the hourglass. Metal and starlight fuse; the key bites into the glass like a brand. Slowly, deliberately, you tilt the hourglass.

Stardust cascades. Each grain that falls becomes a seed, sprouting vibrant vines across the atrium walls—emerald leaves unfurl, trumpet-shaped flowers unfurling with the scent of tomorrow. The vines punch through the ceiling, and daylight—real daylight—pours in, rinsing away the subterranean gloom. The storm above dissipates, shredded by shafts of sun that paint the sky in molten oranges and impossible aquamarines.

When you emerge, the salt flat has transformed into a prismatic forest of crystal trees. Between their facets glide iridescent koi, swimming through air thick as water. High on a branch sits the phoenix, reborn yet again, plumage blazing with every color you once believed you had lost. You notice something new: along its breast a sixth feather, pure white at the tip, indicating a future chapter yet unwritten.

The phoenix bows its head, waits. You understand. You climb the nearest crystal trunk, shards ringing like wind chimes beneath your hands, until you sit astride the phoenix’s back. It unfurls its wings—now whole—and erupts skyward. As you soar over the newly blossomed world, you look down and see six intertwining rivers carving fresh paths through the crystal grove, spelling, in a language older than speech, a simple message:

“Each ending is rehearsal. Each fall, a flight in disguise.”

The wind roars in your ears; the sun ignites the horizon. Behind you, the leviathan’s bones dissolve into dust and join the rivers. Ahead, continents of cloud scatter like stepping-stones. You guide the phoenix toward the brightest one, heart thundering not with dread but with anticipation.

You do not know what awaits atop that cloud—only that the key in your hand has melted into your pulse, and that rebuilding is no longer a punishment, but your art.
