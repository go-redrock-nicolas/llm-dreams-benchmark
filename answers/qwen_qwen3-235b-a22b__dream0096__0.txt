I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt honey and static, as if the world itself is frying at the edges. You stand in a labyrinth of mirrors, each one stretching infinitely, reflecting versions of yourself that flicker like dying film reels. One shows you as a child, knees scraped, eyes wide with the terror of abandonment. Another reveals you older, mouth sewn shut, hands clawing at a throat that won’t scream. The mirrors hum—a low, resonant vibration that thrums in your molars—and between their frames, veins pulse like they’re alive, oozing a viscous, iridescent liquid that pools at your feet.  

Your greatest fear is here.  

It begins as a whisper behind your left shoulder, a voice that sounds like your own but twisted into a sneer. *You knew this would happen. You’ve always known.* You turn, but there’s nothing—only the labyrinth stretching endlessly, the reflections multiplying until they blur into a kaleidoscope of your failures, your regrets, your *weaknesses*. Then the temperature drops. Frost snakes across the mirrors, etching fractals into the glass, and the reflections stop moving. They freeze, staring outward with hollow, accusing eyes.  

And then *it* emerges.  

From the mirror directly ahead, a figure claws its way out, molten glass dripping from its limbs like wax. It’s shapeless at first—a writhing silhouette stitched from shadows and smoke—but as it steps closer, it sharpens into something that knows you intimately. It wears your face, but wrong: eyes too wide, teeth too many, fingers elongated into serrated blades. It’s the embodiment of every “what if” you’ve ever buried. What if you’re not enough? What if you’re a fraud, a coward, a monster? It grins, and its voice is a chorus of everyone who ever doubted you.  

**“You let it get this far.”**  

Panic floods your veins, hot and paralyzing. Your breaths come in shallow gasps, your limbs rooted to the cold, glass-strewn floor. The creature lunges, and time fractures. You’re suddenly elsewhere—*everywhere*. Drowning in a childhood bedroom where the walls bleed. Stumbling through a desert where the sun is a thousand staring eyes. Trapped in a silent crowd, your mouth full of cotton, watching a train barrel toward someone you love but can’t name. Each memory, each nightmare, is a thread the creature weaves around you, tightening like a noose.  

But then—a sound. A heartbeat.  

No, a *drumbeat*, deep and resonant, vibrating through the marrow of the dream. The creature hesitates. The mirrors tremble. You feel it: a pulse of defiance, raw and primal, rising from your gut. You’ve spent your life fearing this thing, this *shapeless terror*, but now, in the marrow of the dream, you realize something: it’s not infinite. It’s made of *you*. Every jagged edge, every shadow, is a fragment of your own story—a story you’ve let fester but have never finished.  

You stop running.  

The creature recoils as you meet its gaze. “You’re not real,” you whisper, and the words crack like thunder. The mirrors shatter, raining shards that dissolve into light before they hit the ground. The labyrinth collapses, revealing a sky ablaze with auroras, their colors bleeding into one another like liquid gemstones. The creature howls, its form unraveling into threads of smoke, and in its place stands a figure—not monstrous, but human. Familiar. Yourself, but softer, radiant with scars that glow like constellations.  

“You were just lonely,” the figure says, and the words are a balm. “You were just afraid to look too closely.”  

The dream dissolves.  

You wake gasping, the taste of static still on your tongue, but your hands are steady. The fear lingers, yes—but so does the light.
