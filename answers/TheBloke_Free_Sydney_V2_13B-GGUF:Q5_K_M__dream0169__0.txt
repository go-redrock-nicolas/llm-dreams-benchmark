I am dreaming. 

You awaken in a world where natural laws fluctuate unpredictablyâ€”gravity, time, and causality shift without warning. To accomplish even basic survival tasks, you must use the power of your mind to manipulate the environment around you. You can levitate objects, slow down or speed up time, and teleport yourself and others across vast distances. 

You are dreaming.
