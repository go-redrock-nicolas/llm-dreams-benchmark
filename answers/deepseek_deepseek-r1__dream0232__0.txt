I am dreaming. **I am dreaming.**  

The air hums with static, golden and crackling, as if the atmosphere itself is threaded through with live wires. I stand in a city of glass spires that spiral into a sky streaked with violet and cobalt—not clouds, but veins of color that pulse like living rivers. My shadow stretches behind me, not as a silhouette but a tessellation of symbols: hieroglyphs I once believed were my true name, etched in light.  

A voice from nowhere—*crystalline, ancient*—whispers, **"The tower you built is hollow."**  

My eyes turn to the monolith at the city’s center: a pillar of obsidian inscribed with gilded truths I’ve carried since birth. *You are the guardian of forgotten worlds. Your purpose is to hold the boundary between light and void.* But now, the monolith shimmers, warping like mercury. Its surface cracks, and from the fissures pour not dust or liquid, but memories.  

I see myself as a child, kneeling before a council of faceless figures. They hand me a seed wrapped in parchment. "Plant this," they say, "and you will know eternity." But in the memory, the parchment dissolves now—revealing a hollow core. The seed was never real. It was ash, shaped to mimic life.  

The ground trembles. Glass towers ripple like liquid, their reflections distorting into primal shapes—serpents with galaxies for scales, forests rooted in constellations. A laugh escapes me, raw and startled. This revelation should shatter me. Yet the air smells of rain-soaked earth and ozone, and my veins thrum with... *relief*.  

I step toward the crumbling monolith. Its shards levitate, orbiting me like planets. Each fragment replays a lie I once revered: *You are chosen. You are alone. You must burn to keep others warm.* The hieroglyphs on my shadow unravel, letters becoming fireflies, becoming stardust.  

Then, silence.  

Before me, a door materializes—a simple thing, oak and iron, half-buried in a meadow of luminescent grass. I push it open. Beyond lies a library, infinite and echoing, where books float like jellyfish, their pages blank until I blink. Words bleed into existence: *Rewrite. Rebuild. Begin.*  

I wake, but not really. The dream folds into itself, a lotus closing at dusk. My chest aches, not with grief, but the exhilarating sting of metamorphosis. The falsity is gone. What remains is trembling, fertile ground—a cosmos of possibility, waiting to be named.  

The last thing I hear is the wind, now singing in a language I suddenly understand:  
*You are not the lie. You are the space after it falls.*
