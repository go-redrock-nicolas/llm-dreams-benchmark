I am dreaming. But this hospital—my hospital—isn’t like any other. The walls pulse with a faint bioluminescent glow, veins of cyan and magenta threading through the ceiling like alien capillaries. The air hums, not with the sterile buzz of machinery, but with a low, resonant drone, as if the building itself is alive and breathing. Alarms wail, dissonant and urgent, echoing down corridors that stretch into impossible distances, warping like reflections in a funhouse mirror. I’m standing at the central hub, but the control panels aren’t made of steel or plastic—they’re organic, throbbing masses of translucent tissue, glowing readouts pulsing through sinewy membranes. My hands sink into them as I work, warm and slightly damp, leaving faint imprints that fade like footprints in wet sand.

The first wave came hours ago—or was it days? Time here bends. Fractured. Patients arrive not on stretchers but suspended in translucent cocoons, their bodies flickering with unstable auras: a man whose skin erupts into crystalline shards, a child dissolving into smoke, an old woman with constellations swimming beneath her epidermis. Our supplies aren’t bandages or IVs. We’re synthesizing stasis fields from the hospital’s own biomass, harvesting light from the walls to stabilize arrhythmic heartbeats. But resources are unraveling. The corridors have started to contract, sealing off wings like a wounded organism cauterizing itself. A nurse—or something resembling one, her form blurred at the edges—rushes to me, her voice layered with static. *”East Quadrant’s degrading. The incubation hub is consuming itself. We need crystalline serum, but the synthesis pods are—”*

Before she can finish, the floor quivers. A low growl ripples through the air. The ceiling above us splits open—a maw lined with jagged, phosphorescent teeth. From it tumbles a new patient, writhing in a corona of black flames that cast no heat. Their chart materializes in my mind, searing itself into my thoughts: *Phase-shifting necrosis. Terminal atmospheric decay. Urgent intervention required.* But the serum vaults are empty. The bioreactors have started cannibalizing staff, their bodies melting into the walls to fuel the failing systems. I turn to prioritize—who lives? Who becomes part of the hospital’s failing anatomy?—when the dream fractures. The walls scream. The light dies. And I wake in a cold sweat, the echoes of that otherworldly triage humming in my bones like a requiem.
In the depths of my dream, the hospital twists into a labyrinth of living, breathing architecture. The hallways are umbilical cords coiling into shadow, floors undulating like the belly of some colossal beast digesting time itself. Every surface drips with a slick, pearlescent mucus that refracts fractal patterns into the air. A storm rages outside, but it is no ordinary tempest—it’s a hurricane of broken clocks, gears and pendulum fragments swirling in a vortex that shreds minutes into confetti. Patients arrive fused with abstract concepts: a man whose screams manifest as flocks of skeletal birds burst from his mouth, a woman whose tears pool into liquid mirrors showing futures where the hospital is a charred husk. We triage using instruments carved from frozen soundwaves, but the tools shatter into shrieks when touched. 

The staff are spectral, their faces shifting masks of loved ones I’ve forgotten—a childhood friend’s laughter stitched to a nurse’s lips, my grandmother’s eyes pooling with black oil in a surgeon’s sockets. They whisper protocols in reverse, their words unspooling into worms that burrow into the walls. The emergency escalates when the hospital’s heart—a colossal, arrhythmic orb suspended in the atrium—begins to calcify. Each faltering beat turns corridors to stone, petrifying patients mid-scream. A child’s cocoon pulses nearby, her body a kaleidoscope of closing portals. To save her, I must graft a piece of the dying heart into her chest, but the act would collapse the entire west wing. As I hesitate, the child’s hand morphs into mine, and she pleads in my own voice: *“Let it burn.”* 

Then, the dream slips. The walls dissolve into a feverish watercolor—indigo bleeding into sulfur, screams melting into cello notes—and I am both surgeon and patient, scalpel and incision, until the world folds inward like a cursed origami, leaving only the echo of the heart’s final, thunderous *crack*.
