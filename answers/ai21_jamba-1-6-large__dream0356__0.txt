I am dreaming. I stand at the crossroads of a vast, open field, where two paths stretch out before me. The first path is wide and well-trodden, bordered by neat rows of perfectly manicured bushes. The air smells faintly of freshly mown grass. Of convention, predictability, and security. Signs along this path proudly proclaim "Corporate Success," "Six-Figure Income," and "Career Stability." The sun is high in the sky, casting a warm glow over the field, but my heart feels hollow. My steps falter as I glance down the other path.
"Do you promise me a steady income? A pension? A comfortable retirement?" I ask myself. "No," the second path whispers, enticing and mysterious. "But I offer you freedom. Fulfillment. Creativity."
