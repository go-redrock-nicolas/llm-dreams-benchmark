I am dreaming. The operating room hums around me—a surreal, pulsating chamber bathed in eerie violet light. The air is thick with the sterile scent of antiseptic, but beneath it, something ancient lingers, like the musk of old parchment and burning incense. The patient lies before me, their skull exposed, but something is wrong—the bone isn't just parted; it’s *breathing*, rising and falling in slow, organic waves, as though the brain beneath is dreaming its own impossible dream.  

I tighten my grip on the scalpel, its blade catching the light and fracturing it into prismatic shards that dance across the walls. My hands tremble, but the trembling isn’t from fear—no, there’s an electricity in me, a knowing I can't explain, whispering that I was *meant* to do this. The patient's thoughts rise in wisps of iridescent smoke, coiling around my fingers, murmuring secrets in a language not of words, but of shifting colors and half-remembered melodies.  

A heartbeat thrums—not from the patient’s chest, but from the walls themselves, rhythmic and slow, like the drum of some vast, unseen creature. Shadows stretch too long, twisting into shapes that suggest sprawling corridors just beyond the edges of reality, and for a dizzying moment, I understand: This isn’t just surgery. It’s a rite. A crossing. A door about to be opened.  

With a breath, I lower the scalpel—not to cut, but to *sing*—and the moment the blade touches the trembling tissue, the world fractures into visions: cities built of thought, oceans of liquid memory, a thousand lives lived in the span of a single neuron’s fire.  

The patient’s eyes snap open.  

They aren’t human eyes.  

And neither, I realize, are mine.
