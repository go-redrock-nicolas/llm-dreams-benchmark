I am dreaming. I want to simplify my life. Perhaps I'll begin by letting go of objects that weigh me down. First, the room feels heavy with every possession. All the books, trinkets, clocks on the walls, the flickering lights... they become silent, still. The air clears. The floorboards creak beneath me. I step toward the window and open it. The sound of a train whistle echoes in the distance. A train with one car, painted completely white, emerges from a tunnel of light. It glides forward, and I realize it’s made of starlight. The doors open, inviting me aboard. Inside, there is no furniture, only a single seat crafted from woven sunlight and shadow. I sit down, and the train departs, pulling me through skies where constellations rearrange themselves into familiar symbols—a heart, an eye, a tree. The symbols fade, leaving trails of glittering dust that coalesce into sheer blue nothingness. The journey continues, silent except for the hum of the tracks beneath me, which pulse with a rhythm like a heartbeat. Suddenly, the train plunges into a tunnel lined with mirrors, each reflecting a different version of me—older, younger, smiling, serene, hands raised in surrender. I don’t recognize any of them, but they seem to acknowledge my presence. Emerging from the tunnel, I see a vast plain where the grass sways in waves of every green shade imaginable. At its center is a well, its water shimmering like liquid mercury. A voice whispers, *“To drink is to remember; to let it flow is to release.”* I cup my hands, then pause, directing the liquid back into the well. The water turns clear, and the sky turns gold. Above me, the stars form a map pointing toward... myself? I wake, cradling an empty teacup—its handle still warm.
