I am dreaming. As my eyes flutter open within the realm of this dream, I find myself standing on the edge of a city that defies every shred of reality I’ve ever known. The skyline is a chaotic symphony of upside-down buildings, their spires piercing the ground while their foundations reach toward a sky that churns with violet and amber storms. The air hums with a strange, melodic static, as if the atmosphere itself is whispering secrets in a language I can’t yet grasp. This is no ordinary world. This is a society where conventional logic is deemed utter madness, and irrational thinking reigns supreme as the guiding principle of existence.

I take a tentative step forward, my bare feet brushing against a street made of shimmering, liquid glass that ripples beneath my weight but doesn’t break. Around me, the citizens of this surreal city move with an erratic grace, their actions defying any sense of purpose I can latch onto. A man in a suit of woven feathers walks backward, laughing hysterically as he tosses handfuls of glittering ash into the air—ash that transforms mid-flight into tiny, luminescent birds that dart away shrieking with human voices. Nearby, a woman in a gown of woven moonlight argues passionately with a lamppost, gesturing wildly as though it’s rebutting her with equal fervor. No one bats an eye at this absurdity; it’s as commonplace here as breathing.

I quickly realize that to survive in this backward world, I must shed the rigid scaffolding of logic that has always tethered me to sanity. My first attempt to interact comes when I approach a marketplace where stalls are suspended upside down from the branches of enormous, crystalline trees. A merchant with three spiraling horns and eyes that flicker like candle flames grins at me, offering a jar labeled “Yesterday’s Thunder.” I hesitate, my mind instinctively reaching for reason—why would anyone buy thunder, and how could it be from yesterday? But I catch myself. That’s the old way of thinking, the “madness” they’d scorn here. So instead, I smile back, nod as if I understand, and ask, “Will it sing if I open it?” The merchant’s face lights up with approval, and he claps his hands, sending a ripple of color through the air. “Of course, stranger! It sings the grief of forgotten storms. A bargain at only seven unspoken promises!”

I don’t have unspoken promises to trade, but I mime placing something invisible on the counter, and to my amazement, the merchant accepts it with a bow. I walk away clutching the jar, feeling a strange thrill at having played by their rules. The jar vibrates faintly in my hands, and I swear I can hear a mournful hum emanating from within—a sound that tugs at memories I didn’t know I had.

Navigating this world requires me to embrace the impossible at every turn. When I’m hungry, I don’t seek food in the way I once would. Instead, I follow a crowd to a grand banquet hall where the tables are piled high with glowing orbs of mist. The diners don’t eat with utensils; they inhale deeply, drawing the mist into their lungs, their faces contorting with expressions of rapturous satisfaction as if they’ve just tasted the finest meal. I mimic them, inhaling a wisp of shimmering fog, and a burst of flavors explodes within me—an impossible blend of warm honey, crackling lightning, and the scent of rain on ancient stone. It nourishes me in a way that transcends the physical, filling a hunger I didn’t even know I carried.

Time itself is a fickle thing here. Clocks run backward, their hands spinning in defiance of progression, and yet no one seems concerned with schedules or deadlines. I witness a child painting a mural on a wall, each stroke depicting events that *will* happen, not ones that have passed. When I ask her why she paints the future, she looks at me with pity and says, “The past is too heavy to carry on walls. We paint tomorrow to lighten the load.” Her words twist in my mind, but I nod as if they make perfect sense, and somehow, in this place, they do.

As I wander deeper into the heart of this society, I encounter a grand council chamber where the leaders debate the fate of their world. But their debates are not conducted with words or arguments—they clash with vivid bursts of emotion, manifesting as torrents of color and sound that flood the room. A wave of crimson fury crashes against a swell of cerulean calm, and the spectators cheer as if watching a sport. I’m invited to contribute, and though I falter at first, I summon a memory of longing—a deep, aching blue-green that spirals from my chest and joins the fray. The council roars with approval, and suddenly I’m accepted as one of their own.

Days—or perhaps mere moments—pass in this dreamscape, and I begin to lose the sharp edges of my former self. I dance with shadows that giggle like children, barter with winds that demand riddles in exchange for safe passage, and sleep beneath a tree whose branches cradle me with whispered lullabies of forgotten gods. My thoughts grow wild and untamed, weaving through impossible loops and tangents, and for the first time, I feel truly at home in this chaos.

But then, as dreams often do, the world begins to fray at the edges. The violet storms in the sky crack open, spilling golden light that burns away the city’s surreal beauty. The citizens dissolve into wisps of smoke, their laughter echoing as they vanish. I clutch the jar of Yesterday’s Thunder, desperate to hold onto something tangible, but it too melts into my hands, leaving behind only the faint hum of a storm I’ll never hear again. The ground beneath me shatters, and I fall through layers of dream into the void of waking.

As my eyes open to the muted gray of my bedroom, I can still feel the ripple of liquid glass beneath my feet, still hear the distant cry of ash-turned-birds. The dream clings to me, a vivid tapestry woven from the deepest threads of my imagination, a reminder that even in a world of logic and order, there is a part of me that yearns for the beautiful madness of the impossible.
