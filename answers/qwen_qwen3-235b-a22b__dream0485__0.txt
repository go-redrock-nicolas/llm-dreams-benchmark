I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt honey and forgotten ink. You stand in a library that stretches into infinity, its shelves carved from the bones of ancient trees, their roots plunging into a sky streaked with violet and gold. Books flutter like caged birds, their pages whispering secrets in languages you almost understand. But you’re not here to read. You’re here to *watch*.  

Before you, a woman with hair like liquid shadow argues with a man whose skin is a mosaic of cracked mirrors. Their voices are knives, slicing through the hush of the library. You feel a flicker of disdain as you notice her claws—sharp, metallic, and cruel—as she rakes them down the spines of passing books. *How selfish*, you think. *She damages what she doesn’t even own*. But then you see it: the tremor in her hands, the way her shadows coil defensively around her. She’s afraid. You’ve seen that fear before—in the way you crumple drafts of letters you’ll never send, in the way you guard your own secrets like dragons hoard gold.  

The man with the mirrored skin turns to you, his face a kaleidoscope of fractured expressions. “She’s *wrong*,” he hisses, his voice splintering into a chorus of accusations. “She’s *wrong*.” You recoil. His rage feels familiar, like the echo of a time you lashed out at someone for the very flaw you hide in yourself—the inability to forgive, the hunger for control. You realize, with a jolt, that his mirrors are not just shards of glass but reflections of *you*. Every judgment you’ve ever cast, every sneer you’ve tucked into the corners of your mind, stares back at you in his fractured face.  

A child materializes between them, no older than six, her body made of watercolor and static. She’s scribbling on the walls with a crayon that bleeds light. “You’re both *boring*,” she says, her voice a melody of defiance. “You fight over who’s worse, but you’re just the same.” The woman’s shadows hiss; the man’s mirrors crack further. And you—you feel a hot, acidic shame rise in your throat. How many times have you dismissed someone for their chaos, their vulnerability, their noise, only to retreat into your own private chaos, your own silent storms?  

The library begins to dissolve. Shelves melt into rivers of parchment, and the ceiling collapses into a vortex of stars. You’re falling, but it’s not a nightmare. A figure emerges from the void—a librarian with the face of an owl, her glasses perched on a beak that speaks without moving. “Projections,” she hoots, “are the soul’s way of saying: *Look here. This is where you’re broken. This is where you’re whole*.” She hands you a mirror, its frame writhing with serpents made of smoke.  

You see yourself.  

But not as you are. As you’ve been: the teenager who mocked the classmate’s stutter, the adult who scorned the friend’s vulnerability, the part of you that hides behind wit to avoid being seen. Yet in the mirror’s depths, those moments twist. The stutter becomes a sacred pause, the vulnerability a cathedral of courage, the mockery a cry for connection. The serpents hiss, *“They are you. You are them. Swallow the mirror, and it will digest your lies.”*  

You wake up gasping, the taste of copper on your tongue. The dream clings to you like perfume, its truth sharp and sweet: every time you judge another, you’re holding a magnifying glass to the parts of yourself you’ve exiled. And somewhere, in the marrow of your bones, you know the work has begun.  

The library is still waiting.
