I am dreaming. The arena stretches endlessly around me, a colossal coliseum of shimmering obsidian and gold, its tiers filled with a faceless, murmuring crowd whose voices twist together like echoes from a hundred distant storms. The air hums with static, thick with the scent of ozone and iron—the tang of anticipation. My heartbeat thrums against my ribs, not with fear, but with a wild, intoxicating awareness that *this* is the moment I was sculpted for.  

Beneath my feet, the ground is not stone but liquid shadow, rippling with each step as if I walk upon the skin of some vast, slumbering beast. Across from me stands my opponent—no, my *mirror*. A figure draped in shifting silver and smoke, their outline blurring at the edges like a fading memory. They don’t move, don’t breathe, yet I *feel* them sizing me up, peeling back layers of my resolve with a gaze like molten glass.  

A bell tolls, deep and resonant, shaking the sky—or perhaps it’s the sound of time itself splitting. Before the echo dies, we *move*.  

My body surges forward, muscles coiled like lightning, but the world distorts. The space between us elongates, compresses, warping like taffy. I lunge, yet my reflection is already behind me, beside me, *inside me*, their presence slipping through my defenses like smoke through fingers. The crowd’s murmurs rise into a deafening wail—a thousand whispers hissing secrets I almost recognize.  

And then—  

A shift. A fracture.  

My reflection falters. Maybe I *want* it more. Maybe they never existed at all. My fist connects, not with flesh, but with something deeper—the shattering of an illusion. The arena dissolves into fractals of color, the shadows coalescing into strings of light, weaving themselves into a new shape: a throne, a door, a key.  

I wake just before I grasp it, but the imprint lingers—this was never about victory. It was about *becoming*.  

And somewhere, in the silence of dawn, I swear I still hear the crowd chanting my name.
