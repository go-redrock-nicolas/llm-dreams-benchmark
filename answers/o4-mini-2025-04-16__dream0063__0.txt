I am dreaming. You’re standing at the center of a great circular plaza whose floor is tiled with shifting symbols: Arabic calligraphy that ripples like water, Cyrillic letters that glow with icy luminescence, Chinese characters that bloom like luminous flowers—and Latin words that spin in perfect circles around your feet. Above you, a vault of translucent glass refracts a thousand dawns at once, so that the sky constantly fractures into new color-combinations—cerulean and rose, jade and gold, lavender and flame—each sunrise bleeding into the next without ever quite settling.

In your hands you clutch a silver tablet etched with an impossibly intricate equation: a fractal of prime numbers wound together by spiraling integrals. As you speak, voices in five languages swirl around your ears. A confident tenor in Spanish urges you to simplify the terms (“simplifica los factores, por favor”), while a whispering Japanese voice offers alternative substitutions (“”). Simultaneously, a booming Russian intones demands (“ ,  ”), and a soft Italian beseeches (“trova il conflitto tra questi numeri”). Every time you focus on one language, the others tug insistently at your attention, like tendrils of mist weaving through your thoughts.

You take a breath—and the world responds. The cobblestones at your feet shiver, reassembling themselves into the graph of a sine wave that pulses under your weight. Each pulse echoes the heartbeat in your temples. You trace the equation on the tablet with a finger that glows faintly blue, and for an instant the numbers lift off the surface, rotating in three dimensions like a celestial sculpture. The wind carries snippets of conversation back to you in rapid succession:

 “… rewrite the constant as an exponential…”
 “… watch how the derivative unfurls…”
 “… did you consider the imaginary axis?…”
 “… stop hesitating, move to the next step…”

As the mental pressure intensifies, you feel reality unfurling at its seams. The languages no longer feel separate—they merge into a single polyphonic chord that thrums through your mind. The plaza tilts sideways, and gravity becomes optional: with each syllable you float a few inches higher, hovering above the rippling tiles. Colors bleed from the written characters, turning air itself into living graffiti that spirals around you in ribbons of green, violet, amber and obsidian.

Your heartbeat accelerates. Beads of sweat form on your brow, but they don’t drip—they crystallize instantly into tiny prisms that refract every syllable you speak. You realize that solving this equation isn’t just an academic exercise—it’s the key to anchoring the dream itself. One wrong step, and the plaza will dissolve, the voices will vanish, and you’ll be cast into a void where nothing remains but silence.

With trembling resolve, you align the tablets’ symbols—prime, exponential, imaginary all converging—into a final maneuver. The words around you synchronize in a single breathless utterance. A pulse of incandescent light erupts from the tablet, sweeping outward like a shockwave. The languages collapse into one perfect phrase that reverberates through every cell of your being:

“La sfera dell’infinito è tua.”

And in that moment, the sky shatters open. You feel yourself falling free, yet paradoxically at rest—caught between triumph and release—tumbling through a tapestry of kaleidoscopic shapes that sing of boundless possibility.
