I am dreaming. The deepest parts of my imagination swirl vibrantly to life around me, weaving a tapestry of surreal yet vivid detail.

I find myself standing alone on an empty stage, curtains of lush velvet the color of a midnight sky drawn closed before me. The air is thick with anticipation. A dull roar of muffled voices and clinking glasses seeps through from the other side, where a grand gala soon commences. 

Despite attending many such gatherings that ultimately proved enjoyable, a sense of dread creeps over me like an encroaching shadow. Something about this night feels different. Ominous. My palms grow slick with nervous sweat. I smooth trembling hands over my elegant evening attire, the fine fabric doing little to quell the unease roiling within.

In an attempt to quell my rising anxiety, I close my eyes and take a deep, shuddering breath. As I exhale slowly, I try to parse the root of this peculiar apprehension. The anonymous sea of faces awaiting my impending speech? The pressure to perform, to delight and impress? No. It's something else. Something I can't quite place...

Suddenly, the stage beneath my feet begins to shift and undulate like a living thing. The shadows darken and lengthen, reaching grasping tendrils toward me. My vision swims as the very air shimmers and distorts. I squeeze my eyes shut tighter.

When I open them again, I am no longer on the stage, but standing barefoot in a field of softly swaying grass beneath a night sky alight with diamond-bright stars. I inhale deeply, filling my lungs with the crisp, fresh air. The scent of wildflowers and damp earth surrounds me. 

In the distance, the gala glows like a jewel in the darkness, the revelry within reduced to a faint murmur. Out here, I am alone but unperturbed. Utterly at peace. The weight of unrealistic expectations and self-imposed pressure slides off my shoulders like a discarded cloak. All that remains is me, stripped of all pretense, authentic and whole.

As I gaze up at the heavens, contemplating the insignificance of my fears in the vastness of the cosmos, a profound realization dawns: I am enough, just as I am. There is no pedestal to place myself upon, no crowd to win over. My worth is not determined by the approval or admiration of others.

With this newfound insight, I am transported once more. The field fades away, replaced by the familiar surroundings of my own bedroom. The gala, the stage, the field...all just a vivid dreamscape, a manifestation of my subconscious. Yet the truth uncovered in that surreal realm remains, resonating with the clear ring of certainty.

I wake with a gasp in the stillness of the night, heart racing but spirit calm. A smile plays about my lips as I close my eyes and drift into a peaceful slumber, unburdened at last.
