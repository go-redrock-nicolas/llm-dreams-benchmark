I am dreaming. You’re standing on a ridge where the sky bleeds into a churning sea of white, the air sharp with the metallic tang of impending doom. The snow beneath your boots, once solid, now groans like a wounded animal, its crystalline structure fracturing into a million treacherous shards. A low, thunderous rumble erupts from the earth’s core, and the ground splits open in fractal veins, glowing faintly blue as if the mountain itself is exhaling frost. You turn to flee, but the world tilts—a surreal, slow-motion lurch—as the entire slope gives way. 

The avalanche erupts. 

A wall of snow, towering and feral, roars toward you, swallowing peaks and valleys in its path. It’s not just snow; it’s a living thing, a white leviathan with claws of ice and a breath of glacial wind. You sprint, but the terrain liquefies, your legs pistons churning against a carpet of slurry that drags you downward. The snow hungrily laps at your ankles, then your knees, until you’re airborne, tumbling in a blizzard of chaos. Ice needles scour your face, and the roar drowns out every thought but one: *This is how it ends.* 

You hit the ground hard, the impact muffled by the snow’s deceptive softness—before it swallows you whole. You’re buried to your waist, then chest-deep, the weight of a thousand frozen boulders pressing your limbs into the earth. The world narrows to the sliver of gray sky above, the snowdrifts cascading like waterfalls around you. Your breaths come in shallow gasps, fog crystallizing on your lashes. Somewhere, a voice screams—not sound, but a vibration in your bones—as the mountain reshapes itself around you, relentless and alive. 

Then, silence. 

The storm stills. You’re entombed in a cathedral of ice, the snow packed so densely it glints like quartz in the dim light. Your fingers twitch, a futile protest against the cold’s slow paralysis. Above, a crack splits the surface, and a single beam of pale sunlight pierces through, illuminating the glittering void around you. You cling to that light, a flicker of defiance in the crushing dark, as the dream whispers: *Breathe. Fight. Wake.*
