I am dreaming. I see a magical door.  I enter it.  Now I'm in a land where my thoughts become real.  I think of a floating island with waterfalls and gardens.  It appears.  I touch a glowing flower, and colors burst outward.  I think of a friendly dragon.  It appears, with scales like stained glass.  We fly over an ocean of clouds.  I imagine a city of light, and it materializes.  I meet a creature made of starlight.  It speaks in riddles.  I think of my childhood home, and it's there.  I feel emotions turn into physical things - joy as butterflies, sorrow as rain.  I wish to meet a lost friend, and they appear.  We talk.  The world starts to fade. I run back to the door.  I wake up.
