I am dreaming. The first thing I notice is the way time bends and flows through my mind like a river. When I feel happy, moments stretch and spread out, glowing golden like warm syrup. But when fear creeps in, time contracts into jagged shards, each second sharp enough to slice my breath into gasps. I wander through a city that's alive, its buildings breathing and sighing with every emotion I let loose.
