I am dreaming. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the drone of a thousand synchronized heartbeats. You stand in a circular chamber of iridescent stone, walls rippling with veins of molten silver. Around you, figures move in a choreographed trance, their faces obscured by masks of gold that melt and reform like liquid sunlight, dripping into collars etched with symbols you cannot decipher. Their voices blend into a mantra that isn’t sound but vibration — a thrumming command that tunnels into your bones: ***Converge. Belong. Become.***  

You raise your hands and find them gloved in the same gilt metal, heavy and warm, your reflection in the wall-mirror now a stranger’s face. Yet beneath the mask, your skull prickles. A memory surfaces — fleeting, sharp — of wind carrying the scent of salt and pine, a place where your name was your own. The dissonance cracks the rhythm. Your left foot falters mid-step.  

A voice, small but unyielding, slithers into your mind: *"Lavender. Rain-soaked pages. The taste of sour cherries."* Fragments of a self you’re forgetting. As the crowd pivots, you stagger backward, your heel cracking a fissure in the floor. Through the split, roots surge upward, coiled and phosphorescent, blooming into a spectral tree whose branches drip with glowing amber resin. Each droplet reflects a scene: a childhood laugh, a betrayal, a midnight confession — *yours*, not theirs.  

The masks turn toward you, molten gold hardening into twisted snarls. Their chant crescendos, now a physical force pressing your ribs inward. But the tree’s roots anchor you. Plucking a resin-tear, you hurl it into the crowd. It explodes into a storm of moths, wings stamped with fingerprints. They devour the masks, exposing faces as blank as porcelain.  

A figure emerges from the chaos — your mirror-self, now flesh, holding a lantern filled with black flame. ***"Burn with us or burn alone,"*** it hisses. But the moths spiral into the flame, transforming it to liquid starlight. You drink it, and the chamber shatters.  

You wake on a beach of powdered sapphire, the horizon pulsing with a light that is neither sun nor moon. Your hands are bare. The tide whispers a word that might be your name — or a new one, waiting to be chosen.
