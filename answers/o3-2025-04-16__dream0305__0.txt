I am dreaming. …find yourself drifting through an other-worldly city that seems stitched together from fragments of places you’ve loved: cathedral spires emerge from coral reefs; skyscrapers sway like trees; moon­light collects in puddles of liquid glass. The scent of rain and old paper hovers in the air, the very atmosphere pulsing with a gentle hum, as though the city itself is breathing.

You float toward an immense circular plaza, its marble floor etched with luminous constellations that shift when you’re not looking. In the center stands a grand, spiraling library—its shelves spiraling upward like a nautilus shell, stacked with books whose pages glow faintly blue, pulsing in time with your heartbeat. Preserving knowledge, truth, and stories is one of your most cherished principles—something that feels almost sacred.

Suddenly a sharp crack splinters the dream’s hush. You whirl around to see a tall figure in a crimson cloak striding across the plaza, dragging a heavy sack that clinks with stolen volumes. With a careless flourish they dump the books in a shallow brazier, strike a silver match, and touch flame to parchment. Pages curl; letters bleed into smoke; ideas that once lived in ink gasp and vanish into the swirling sky.

A wave of cold outrage rises inside you, vivid as lightning. This is a violation of everything you value: the deliberate destruction of knowledge itself. You can almost hear the words screaming as they burn. For a moment you hover, paralyzed by shock; then options flash before you, each more fantastic than the last—this is a dream, after all, and possibility bends in every direction.

Option One:
You summon the wind. With a sweep of your arms the dream-air obeys, swirling into a focused vortex. The flames sputter; ashes spiral upward; the books—some seared, some mere singed fringes—levitate out of the brazier. You guide them gently back to their shelves, the glowing letters knitting themselves together, pages restoring in a golden shimmer. The cloaked arsonist stumbles, disarmed by your silent command of the elements.

Option Two:
You choose dialogue over force. Stepping between the figure and the fire, you command the dream to slow down. Time stretches like taffy; sparks freeze mid-air. You look into the arsonist’s hood and see not a villain but a frightened face, someone convinced that certain stories are too dangerous to exist. You listen—truly listen—while the world holds its breath. In that suspended heartbeat, you offer an alternative: a chamber deep inside the library where contentious ideas can be examined rather than erased. Your compassion dissolves their fear; the match falls extinguished, the fire fades, and a tentative peace blooms.

Option Three:
Rage blooms brighter than the flame itself. You conjure a quill that transforms into a shimmering spear of ink and determination. With it you carve a boundary around the library: an invisible dome of pure, unbreakable narrative energy. The arsonist’s cloak frays, crimson threads unraveling into harmless ribbons that flutter away. Disarmed, the figure flees, pages from the rescued books swirling after like triumphant pennants.

Whichever path you take, the dream responds in vivid, fluid colors. The plaza brightens, constellations on the floor rearranging to spell a single word—CHOICE—in luminous runes. A hush falls. The library hums a soft, grateful chord, as though thanking you for your protection.

A final ripple passes through the dreamscape. The stars above flare, the city’s coral spires sway, and a gentle rain of silver letters falls, spelling out countless untold stories waiting to be written. You realize that the violation you witnessed has forged a deeper resolve within you: to defend truth, preserve wisdom, and answer destruction not with despair, but with creation.

The dream begins to fade. The humming quiets, the colors soften, and you feel yourself drifting back toward waking consciousness—carrying with you the scent of rain-soaked parchment and the fierce certainty that, given the chance, you will always stand between the flame and the page.
