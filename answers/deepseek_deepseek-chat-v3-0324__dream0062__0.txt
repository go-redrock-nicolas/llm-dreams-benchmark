I am dreaming. **The Dream:**

The air hums with barely contained energy, thick with the scent of ozone and damp stone. I stand at the heart of a vast, cavernous chamber, its vaulted ceiling lost in swirling indigo mist. Beneath my feet, an intricate mosaic of luminescent tiles pulses in time with some distant, throbbing rhythm—like the heartbeat of the earth itself.  

Before me stretches an enormous, clockwork apparatus of gleaming brass and obsidian, its cogs and pistons moving with hypnotic precision. A symphony of hissing steam and chiming gears fills the space. This is the Celestial Regulator, a machine of unimaginable power, said to balance the very fabric of time and dreams.  

My team—silhouetted figures in long, silver-robed coats—move with practiced efficiency, adjusting dials, aligning arcane sigils, murmuring incantations that flicker in the air like fireflies. Every gesture, every whispered word is a stitch in the delicate tapestry we weave. The Regulator must be calibrated before the Black Eclipse, or the threads of reality will fray beyond repair.  

But then—without warning—the chamber trembles. A deep, groan fissures the floor, and from the jagged cracks rise jagged shards of obsidian, twisting and reshaping themselves into something *alive.* Shadow-wrought serpents with eyes like dying stars slither through the machinery, their touch warping the gears, turning polished brass to rust in an instant. Time itself begins to stutter—fragments of past and future flicker like broken mirrors: a soldier from an unwritten war stumbles into the chamber; a flock of paper birds with human voices scatters overhead, whispering warnings in tongues not yet born.  

My pulse is a drum, my breath sharp with adrenaline. I don’t hesitate.  

Stepping onto the central platform, I press my palms against the master conduit, feeling the raw currents of chrono-energy sear through my veins. The pain is exquisite, a white-hot clarity. I *push*—not with muscle, but with will—realigning the fractured mechanisms through sheer intent. My team rallies, their voices rising in unison, weaving counter-charms to repel the invading shadows.  

And then—the machine *sings.* A single, pure tone shatters the chaos. The serpents dissolve into smoke. The fissures seal. The Regulator’s heart ignites with liquid gold light, and for one suspended moment, the entire chamber exists outside of time.  

I awake with a gasp, the taste of lightning still on my tongue.
