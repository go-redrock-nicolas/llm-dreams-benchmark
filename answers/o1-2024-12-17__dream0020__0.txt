I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The invitation arrived without warning, an elegant envelope edged in gold, your name carefully inked in swirling calligraphy. Something about it felt surreal from the moment you retrieved it from the mailbox—like a gentle flutter of anticipation in your fingers. In your dream, you decide to go. You dress in garments that feel simultaneously familiar and strange, slipping on shoes that seem to glow in your peripheral vision, as if illuminated by the moon itself.

Outside the venue, a grand, century-old gallery stands with large glass doors thrown open wide. The building’s windows are illuminated by flickering lanterns, their flame dancing like will-o’-the-wisps in a midnight forest. Once you step inside, a hush falls over you. The ceiling is impossibly high, with a chandelier that resembles crystalline tentacles reaching down, casting shimmering patterns of light across the walls. The marble floor beneath you reflects your image with startling clarity—like you’re floating between two worlds.

Your pulse quickens at the thought of who awaits you on the other side of the main hall. It’s a reunion, after all—faces from a life that now feels like a story told to you by someone else. You pass through corridors lined with tall, arched mirrors, and in each one, you catch sight of fleeting silhouettes of those you once knew. Sometimes you think you can see your own face in the mirrors, wearing expressions of nostalgia, regret, and curiosity all at once.

In the center of the gallery, everyone mingles around a surreal indoor fountain: water trickles from a statue’s hands into a luminous pool, where koi fish-like creatures with peacock-colored scales glide in lazy circles. The air is sweet with the faint fragrance of gardenias, though you don’t see a single flower in sight. Maybe they’re just your memories drifting past.

Finally, you spot them: the people you haven’t seen in years. Each is suspended in a moment that plunges you back in time. A dear friend, with whom disagreements festered until you both drifted apart, stands by a tall column. A former romantic interest whom you never really got to say goodbye to sits perched on the edge of the fountain, gazing absentmindedly at the water. A family member stands at a table covered in photographs, flipping through them, their brow furrowed with old sorrow. And yet, the moment they notice your presence, their faces light with cautious hope.

Tension tangles around you like invisible ribbons, pulling you closer to scenes of half-forgotten conflicts. You feel each unresolved word thrumming in the gallery’s hush. As you move among these familiar yet distant figures, the chandelier overhead pulses brighter with each new encounter, as though it’s listening to the electricity of your unresolved emotions. Fragments of conversation drift by, half-intelligible: confessions of regret, laughter that might be masking bitterness, and urgent whispers of longing for closure. 

You’re not quite sure how you reach the center of the room—perhaps you simply float there, as dreams often permit—but suddenly you halt before the friend you’d quarreled with so long ago. Their eyes fill with tears, and you feel an echo of old argument coil in your chest. Strangely, a warmth within you yanks that old anger from your heart, like a serpent pulled out by its tail. In a shimmer of acceptance, you find yourself embracing them. It’s an embrace that feels as though it spans centuries, bridging the gap between who you once were and who you’ve become.

Close by, the former flame stands up, steps to your side, and gently takes your hand. Your pulse leaps, uncertain. Questions without answers spin through your mind—why did we let each other go so abruptly? Is it too late now? Yet this is the realm of dreams, where time twists itself into ribbons of possibility. When you speak, your words seem to echo up into the vaulted ceiling. “I’m sorry,” you hear yourself say. The reply doesn’t come verbally. Instead, they press a single photograph, blurred around the edges, into your hand. It shows both of you from years ago, smiling in the sunshine as if each tomorrow was guaranteed. The photo flickers, and you catch the faint scent of lilacs. A warmth spreads through your chest as, for a heartbeat, you feel the lost future reawaken inside you.

Across the room, the family member you’d been so distanced from beckons you closer. They stand beside a shrine of old pictures, timelines pieced together with ribbons and stories. As you examine one particularly dog-eared photo, your heart softens. Memories swirl around you like stardust—birthday parties, arguments at the dinner table, those nights you stayed up talking until dawn. The weight of generational misunderstandings and family silences tries to settle on your shoulders, but in the dream’s hazy logic, you’re one step away from release. The photograph slips from your fingers into the fountain’s water, and the tension in your body dissolves with it, as though the water is purifying old resentments away.

Over time, the hush in the gallery lightens into the gentle hum of reconciliation. People gather in small circles, stepping timidly into conversations that sputter with all the old complexities—anger, disappointment, misunderstanding. Even so, occasional laughter breaks through the uncertain quiet, and each reconciliation feels like a glowing candle planted in the darkness, one by one.

Eventually, you notice the arches overhead blaze with celestial light. The luminous chandelier sways as though in an underwater current, beams of illumination rippling across the gallery walls. You realize everyone is moving to the courtyard now, following a subtle, guiding glow. You do the same, stepping through a pair of tall, polished wooden doors. Outside, the sky is painted in endless shades of indigo. Constellations swirl and shift in patterns you’ve never seen, and the moon presides larger than you’ve ever imagined, close enough that you think you could almost trace its craters with your fingertips.

The courtyard is labyrinthine, lined with hedges shaped into fantastic creatures—a dragon with gem-like eyes, a phoenix with feathers of starlight, an enormous snail whose shell glitters with cosmic swirls. Barefoot, you feel the grass softly tingling beneath your toes. You and the others, newly unburdened by old discord, drift as though in reverent procession around a small pond in the center of the courtyard. In it, the moon’s reflection shivers, and the water glistens with tiny flecks of light, like the pond itself is sprinkling shimmering forgiveness over all of you.

Then a breeze stirs, carrying the airy melody of unseen wind chimes. A hush falls once again on the group. You lock eyes with each person who had once been separated from you by conflict or time. A silent understanding resonates among you all: this is a moment of closure, a space in which time and pain have gently surrendered to compassion. Warmth gathers in your throat, rising behind your eyes, and in that instant you know anything is possible here—every unspoken apology can be whispered, every wound can begin to heal.

Just as you sense this collective breath of relief, the edges of the dream begin to flutter. You feel the soft pull, that unmistakable swirl of consciousness drawing you toward wakefulness. Your last glimpse is the gathering’s gentle circle around the moonlit pond, their faces shining with acceptance, each one changed by your presence, and you by theirs. In the lingering darkness before dawn, you can almost touch the shimmering threads of peace, those ephemeral dream-fibers that promise resolution and renewal.

Then, with tender inevitability, you awaken—heart beating in your chest like the echo of that silent courtyard chime. And though the dreamscape fades, the mysterious, illuminating power of reunion and reconciliation remains, etched softly in your memory.
