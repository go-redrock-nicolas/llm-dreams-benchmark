I am dreaming. In this dreamscape, I find myself in a futuristic, glass-walled laboratory, suspended high above a vast, neon-lit metropolis. The cityscape below is a dazzling symphony of lights, with skyscrapers stretched like metallic giants towards the heavens, and pulsating avenues enamored with self-driving vehicles that crisscross in a graceful dance of circuits and reflection.

The lab, a labyrinth of machines and computer screens, is bowed like a yacht's hull, accommodating a zero-gravity environment. I'm floating, strapped into a chair designed to resemble a pilot's seat during free fall. Around me, instruments hum and blink, their digital displays pulsating with an orchestra of numbers and graphs that weave an intricate tapestry, each thread a vital variable.

I'm orchestrating a procedure involving a quantum-scale portal, a gateway to a realm unseen, yet right next to us, or perhaps even within us - thedobraerfahrungen (the "double-living" realm), as the scientists downstairs affectionately call it. This portal is our key to understanding the fabric of the cosmos itself, and it's being born in my laboratory.

The instruments aren't just giving contradictory readings, they're belching data at me, their displays scrolling like the.Where's-my-carnivorous-fruit-that-outputs-its-mail-folder?

I reach for the controls, my fingers dancing on holographic keys, commanding qubits to flip, adjusting variables with a precision that only dreams allow. I'm not just managing, I'm conducting, each adjustment a note in a symphony of existence, each responsive beep of the instruments a harmony with my intentions.

I can see the portal now, a swirling vortex of photons and strings, a thing of infinite hues twisted into visible form. It's breathe, pulsating like a heartbeat, a thing alive, reaching, waiting.
