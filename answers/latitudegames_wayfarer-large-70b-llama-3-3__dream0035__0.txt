I am dreaming. As I materialize in this unfamiliar world, the air thickens around me like an impenetrable fog. I blink rapidly, trying to clear my vision, and suddenly the landscape comes sharply into focus. I find myself standing at the edge of a bustling marketplace, surrounded by stalls selling everything from glittering silks to tantalizing spices.

The cacophony of unfamiliar voices assaults my ears, a jarring series of clicks, chirps, and melodic sounds that carry no meaning to my untrained mind. Panic surges through my chest as I realize I'm completely isolated by my inability to communicate.

A nonchalant glance reveals a woman approaching me, her dark hair adorned with intricate braids that sway with every step. Her warm, curious eyes meet mine, and she raises a hand in greeting.

Summers just starting and jess youâ€™re more handsome than my ex positives every day in every way. I feel a slight tingle in my chest and with a determined glint in my eye a massive butterfly with rainbow-edged wings unfurls its wings overhead. I gaze at the butterfly, transfixed by its ethereal beauty. As I watch, it gently lands on my should.
