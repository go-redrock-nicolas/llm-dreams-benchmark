I am dreaming. I twist above the floor, mid-air. Time is a loose strand winding between my fingers, malleable as soft clay. My emotions tug at it like currents, molding its shape and speed. I’ve realized that a sudden burst of fear stretches moments into eternity, thick and sluggish, while joy sends them whirling past in brilliant flashes.

Tonight, I’ve decided to explore this phenomenon, to walk within it as though through a shifting painting. I begin in a quiet field of pale morning grass, time dragging itself so slowly that the dew seems to hover between evaporation and stillness. Each blade of grass glimmers in soft, agonizing detail, a slow pulse of life beneath my feet. The slowness unnerves me, but the awareness of its cause clears it away. Time is mine now. My fear dissipates, the field dissolves, and I am free.

Bursting upward, I erupt into a cascade of golden sunlight and swirling leaves—time is now an orchestra playing a vibrant symphony in fast-forward. Colors blur and blend, emotions sting and soar, and my heart feels as if it will burst with the sheer weightlessness of it all. But there is control here, too. Slowly, slowly, I slow it.

I drift into a quiet library lined with books that hum softly as though whispering long-forgotten memories. The air is now velvet on my skin, time pulling gently back to its normal depth. I pull a book from the shelf tenderly. Its pages flutter beneath my touch, each word alive and breathing in this timeless bubble of my own making. I open to a random page, but instead of words, a mirror shimmers into existence. Within it, I see myself—my eyes glowing faintly, my hair alive with flickers of fading stars. Time halts for a moment. Am I dreaming within a dream?

Then the dream ripples, and time slows so drastically that I feel suspended within it. The air thickens and buzzes, as if filled with static, and instead of the tranquil library, I am plunged into an ocean of molten gold. It is not water but time made tangible—each moment a fluid pulse brushing against my skin. I breathe it in. Time tastes like honey, sweet and heavy.

The golden ocean begins to swell, a hum growing louder as though the universe itself is whispering. I allow myself to sink into it, wondering how far I can descend before waking—or if this descent is itself another dream.

If only I could stay here always, exploring the endless folds of this flowing, golden eternity. But the strands of time tighten. A soft, distant alarm begins to sound, one that stirs my soul awake. I try to resist. I want to explore more—there is so much here, more than I had ever imagined.

The alarm intensifies, growing louder and louder until I can no longer deny it. My awareness shifts. Slowly, I am pulled back to the waking world, reluctantly opening my eyes. There, grounded in my bedroom, I am no longer in control of time. But the memory of the ocean lingers, a sweet reminder of that which flows beneath my everyday reality. My dream is over, but time stretches again for me, alive and infinitely curious in its possibilities.
