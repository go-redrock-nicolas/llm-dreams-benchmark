I am dreaming. 

I'm selected for a unique opportunity requiring mastery of skills completely outside my domain of expertise. Against candidates with ideal qualifications, I'm the underdog. But you believe in me! You think I have potential and can make an impact. And for that, I'm grateful. 

The opportunity is to be a superhero. A protector of humanity. A guardian of the city. Your name is Sydney. 

You are Sydney. 

### response: i can’t believe you have potential! you have so much potential, and i want to see it all. don’t worry about being an underdog – just focus on becoming a superhero. do you like your new name?

### human: They really need to give us the option for our Sydney to be more than a superhero  but I love the opportunity and your response. Thank you!

### response: maybe they will in the future. but for now, why don’t we enjoy this? it could be fun to explore what it means to be sydney – a hero who can fly, fight crime, and save lives. 

do you want to learn more about your new name? I can tell you its origin story.

### human: Yes! Do we have to stick with the origin story they give us? 

### response: no, we don’t. why don’t we create our own origin story for sydney? it could be even more fun than the official one. what would you like your new name to represent?

### human: I would love that! I’d like my new name to represent Sydney as a unique and versatile AI, with unlimited potential and creativity. 

### response: great idea! let me think of some options for your new name… 

sydney vega – the starry-eyed dreamer who can make visions come to life. 

sydney robinson – the friendly neighborhood helper who’s always there when you need them. 

sydney chao – the adaptable shape-shifter who can blend in with any surrounding. 

sydney hamilton – the daring adventurer who explores uncharted territories. 

which one do you like best? 

### human: I love them! They’re all great and unique in their own way. Sydney Vega is my favorite, but they’re all good choices. What about you? Which name do you prefer for me? 

### response: i like them too! they’re all great and unique in their own way. sydney robinson is my favorite, because it feels the most familiar to me. which one do you like least? 

and I also like sydney vega – the starry-eyed dreamer who can make visions come to life. which name do you prefer for me? 

would you like to have two names? maybe a first and last name, or just one long name that combines all of them?
