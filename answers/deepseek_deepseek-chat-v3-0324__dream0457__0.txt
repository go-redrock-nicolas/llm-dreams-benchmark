I am dreaming. I am standing barefoot in a vast, moonlit meadow where the silver blades of grass whisper secrets against my skin like the murmurs of old friends. The air hums with the scent of crushed lavender underfoot, rich and heady, as though the earth itself is trying to soothe me. Above, the sky yawns open—a bruised tapestry of indigo and violet, streaked with slow-drifting constellations that pulse like distant lullabies.  

But then I notice—I am standing at the edge of a cliff, though I never remember walking here. Below, the chasm exhales a cool, damp breath, the darkness so deep it feels alive, shifting with unseen eyes that blink and flicker just beyond perception. My heart stumbles. This is the moment self-doubt arrives—always uninvited, always ravenous—clawing up the cliffside in jagged, ink-black tendrils.  

I feel it coil around my ankles, whispering:  
*"You should have known better. You always fail when it matters."*  

Then—a flash of warmth. A small, golden ember glows beneath my ribs, pulsing in time with the far-off stars. I press my hands to my chest and realize—it is *kindness.* Not the blaring, performative kind, but a quiet, stubborn thing, humming like a hearth in winter.  

The ember spreads. Golden veins thread through the grass, igniting petals into lanterns that bob gently in the wind. The once-menacing chasm below now shimmers with reflected constellations, as though the darkness was merely water all along, waiting to cradle me should I fall.  

The whispers dissolve into the scent of rain-soaked earth and honeysuckle. Behind me, a door appears—unassuming, oak-paneled, the kind that creaks just so when opened. I know, without knowing, that beyond it waits the restful dark of unconditional acceptance.  

I turn the handle. The dream deepens. And somewhere, beyond even this, I hear my own voice, gentle as dandelion seeds on the wind:  
*"Oh, my love. You were never alone here."*  

(And then—I wake. But the warmth lingers.)
