I am dreaming. …I become acutely aware of the suspended silence, as if the world has drawn a long, intentional breath. In this space between stirrings—between the spark of emotion and the leap of action—the air glitters faintly, shimmering with possibility. My surroundings melt and shift: what was once an ordinary room becomes a luminous garden of midnight blue, where the moon’s silver threads weave through the air and flowers open with iridescent sighs.

In that pause, time slows to a syrupy crawl. I notice the sensation of my heartbeat echoing in my chest—not frantic or hurried, but deliberate and grounding. The triggering words, the tension, the heat behind my eyes, all become petals unfurling on the surface of a deep, still lake. I can see each emotion, each sharp retort, as if they are shimmering fish flitting by—visible, but not mine to seize.

Within the lucid hush, I remember I have a choice. I let the impulse float away, watching it dissolve like mist under the caress of dawn. In the space left behind, I feel something softer stirring—a gentle current of curiosity, an openness, the faint laughter of distant bells.

As I breathe out, the garden blooms brighter. I realize that in this pause between what happens to me and how I respond, there is freedom. My thoughts, once confined and rigid, are now wild streams, and I am free to choose not just what to say, but who to become in the act of speaking.

The dream swirls onward, the night garden unspooling beneath my feet as I step forward with compassion—toward others, but first and foremost, toward myself.
