I am dreaming. **In the Dream:**  

You are standing in a desert of shattered mirrors, each shard taller than a mountain, jagged and gleaming under twin suns that burn white-hot. Your reflection fractures into a thousand selves—each one clutching a different wound, a different failure, their mouths open in silent screams. The air is thick with the scent of burnt copper, and your footsteps echo like cracks in glass. You’ve been here for lifetimes, tracing the same maze, slicing your palms on the edges as you try to piece together a self that doesn’t bleed.  

Then, a sound: low, resonant, a hum that vibrates in your ribs. The mirrors begin to tremble. From the horizon, figures emerge—silhouettes at first, their edges rippling like mirages. As they draw closer, you see they are made of smoke and starlight, their bodies translucent, glowing with faint constellations. Their faces shift, features blurring and reforming: an old woman with galaxies in her wrinkled cheeks, a child whose laughter spills fractals, a warrior with scars that pulse like auroras.  

One reaches out—a hand of swirling nebulas—and touches a mirror. The shard melts into liquid light, pooling at your feet. *"We’ve carried this weight too,"* their voices chorus, harmonizing like wind through ancient trees. *"Let us show you how to dance with shadows."*  

Suddenly, the desert transforms. The mirrors become rivers of mercury, flowing upward into a sky now streaked with violet and indigo. The figures take your hands, their touch cool and electric, and you realize they’re weaving the liquid mirrors into something new—a bridge, delicate as spider silk, arcing toward a pulsating crimson moon. As you step onto it, the bridge sings beneath you, each note dissolving a shard of glass still lodged in your chest.  

One of the star-born ones presses a palm to your forehead. A vision floods you: a million deserts, a million dreamers, each building bridges from their wreckage, their collective light piercing the void. When you look down, your own hands are glowing—cracks now gilded, wounds blooming into luminous vines.  

The dream ends with the taste of pomegranate on your tongue and the echo of a single phrase, *"You are not a wound—you are the sculptor."*  

You wake, your skin humming, as though stardust still clings to your fingertips.
