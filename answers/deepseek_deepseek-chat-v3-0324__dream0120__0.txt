I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning incense and the faint metallic tang of freshly sharpened ceremonial blades. Around me, a grand hall of polished obsidian and gold stretches endlessly, its ceilings lost in curling tendrils of bluish smoke. The elders of the Court of Cendrillian Veils are watching me, their faces obscured behind delicate masks of beaten silver, each etched with sigils I don’t yet comprehend.  

I had thought it a simple gesture—presenting the offering with my left hand instead of my right—but the moment the goblet passed from my fingers, the entire chamber tensed. The air itself seemed to solidify, and music from the unseen bone flutes stuttered into silence. My guide, a slender figure clad in whispering silk, went rigid beside me, their breath catching audibly.  

Then came the whispers, like serpents sliding between the tiles.  

*"Sha’im varath. Sha’im varath."*  

A sin of the unversed. A violation without malice—but ignorance, here, is no defense. The elders rise in unison, their robes hissing like dry leaves, and the masks tilt toward me in perfect, chilling harmony.  

Now, the true trial begins.
