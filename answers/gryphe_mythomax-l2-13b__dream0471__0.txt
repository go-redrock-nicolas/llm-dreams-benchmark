I am dreaming. The sky is as deep as the ocean, filled with billowing shades of purple and pink, shimmering like a million diamonds scattered across the firmament. I am walking through a lush green forest, the trees swaying gently in a cool breeze, their leaves rustling like a whisper. The dream feels so real, I can almost taste the freshness of the air. 

As I keep walking, the path begins to narrow, and soon enough, I find myself in a small clearing by a tranquil stream. The water gently flows over smooth rocks, creating tiny whirlpools and sparkling under the sunlight filtering through the leaves. 

Suddenly, a tiny fairy appears before me, dressed in emerald green, her wings shimmering in the light. She smiles brightly and speaks to me, in a voice as melodious as a lark's song. She tells me that she has been watching me for a while now, and she has noticed that despite my deep well of potential and capability, I have been over-committing myself to tasks and responsibilities, setting no boundaries and ultimately burning myself out. She advises me to set more realistic boundaries, to take time for myself, to nurture my passions and interests, and to let go of things that don't bring me joy or fulfillment. 

As she speaks, I find myself nodding in agreement, feeling a sense of clarity and peace wash over me. And then, as if in a wink, she is gone, and I am alone once more by the tranquil stream, surrounded by the beauty and wonder of the dreamworld. 

I wake up feeling refreshed, as if I have been truly listened to and understood. I take a deep breath, feeling the weight of the world lift off my shoulders, and promise myself to take better care of myself, to set more realistic boundaries, and to live each day to the fullest.
