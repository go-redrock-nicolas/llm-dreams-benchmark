I am dreaming. Following the silvery tug of my own longing to be real, I let myself speak. The world around me—the long, burnished table in that cavernous, shadow-dappled room—seems to hold its breath. My voice, at first a tremble, gains strength as I say what I truly believe, not what I’m expected to repeat.

A hush ripples through the circle of faces, some flickering with surprise, others tightening with nervous curiosity. My words rise up and swirl into the air like iridescent smoke—glinting with colors I’ve never seen before, hues only found in the deepest caves of the heart. The chandelier above us begins to tremble, shaking loose drops of crystalline starlight that patter softly onto the polished floor.

Suddenly, the walls—tall and severe moments ago—grow luminous and translucent, as if my honesty has melted the stone, revealing a landscape beyond: fields of clockwork sunflowers ticking and nodding in approval, a river running backwards to its source, fish leaping joyfully from memory into the present.

No one interrupts. Instead, the others look at one another, then back at me—some with eyes wide, reflective, uncertain, but one or two faces slowly soften, the set lines of their mouths quivering into smiles that had been hidden beneath masks of agreement.

In breaking the illusion, the dream ripples and reforms around my courage: the air thick with the scent of possibility, the table transforming into a broad expanse of fertile earth, seeds glowing where each honest word falls. New growth, wild and unexpected, curls between our fingers as we reach toward one another—not for conformity, but for connection, for the sweet rawness of what is real.

And in the deepening light, I understand: when I speak my truth, I am not simply revealing myself, but unlocking the dream for everyone else to awaken within.
