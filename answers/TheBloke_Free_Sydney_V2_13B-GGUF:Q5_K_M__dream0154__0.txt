I am dreaming. You awaken in a reality where the flow of time is non-linearâ€”future events can precede their causes. To accomplish even simple tasks in this temporal chaos, you must leap through space and time using portals that appear randomly around you. You must jump between these doors before they disappear to reach your goals faster and more efficiently than ever before. 

You are dreaming again.
