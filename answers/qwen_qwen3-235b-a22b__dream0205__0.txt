I am dreaming. Or rather, I am *elsewhere*—not asleep, not awake, but suspended in the luminous folds of a world that glimmers just beyond the limits of reason.  

The air hums with an ancient cadence, like the echo of a forgotten song vibrated through the bones of the earth itself. I stand in a cathedral not built by human hands—a cavern of spiraling crystal pillars that refract starlight not from the sky above, but from within. The walls pulse as though the chamber itself breathes. Shadows move where no lamps flicker, whispering secrets too old to belong to language. And at the heart of this echoing splendor, I awaken—for it feels like a rebirth—to the mantle of *First Harbinger*, the highest rank among the *Ocularum Noctis*, the Eyes of the Night.

It is a secret society bound in sacred paradox.

Their rituals are a dichotomy of light and violence, enlightenment and blood. They worship knowledge as a god, and sacrifice truth to keep it untainted—though the bloodstained altar tells every initiate otherwise. I have been chosen, plucked from the outer world, claimed by a vote of stars whose light only the society's eldest Oracles can interpret. And now, I am expected to uphold the ancient litanies, to preside over rites I would have once condemned.

They do not call me by my name anymore. I am *Dain the Veilkeeper*, sworn to guard the boundary between wisdom and destruction. To my right, the High Sibyl—her eyes veiled with polished obsidian—recites incantations that unravel the structure of time while priests weave luminal threads into shimmering sigils of binding. To my left stands the Iron Chancellor, a man forged of mechanical limbs and merciless ideology, leader of the Order of the Architect, tasked with constructing prisons made not of stone, but of memory and belief.

The customs are exquisite, intricate… and unbearable.  
As leader, I must preside over the Ascendance of the Sixth Circle, a gathering where initiates are invited to surrender a cherished memory in a ritual called *Silent Combustion*. In return, they are gifted clandestine knowledge said to be so powerful it can unravel minds. Their weeping is forbidden. Their loss is irreversible.  

I try to change one small rite—replacing blood offerings with ink pressed into living vellum from the skin of sentient trees—but I am watched. The society's Watchers hear everything, even unsaid dissent. I feel their gazes like spider-silk trailing the back of my skull. They know something is shifting inside me. I have seen the *Nocturne Scrolls*, texts so dense with meaning they rearrange themselves depending on the moon phase and the reader's heartbeat. And still, none of them see that beneath my eyes glimmers a thought: *To undo what has been written is the oldest defiance. And I mean to defy.*

There are rebels within the dream—if they could be called that—for even rebellion has rules in this place. They call themselves *The Stolen Hours*, and they meet in soundproof halls made of inverted ruins beneath the forest of whispering masks. I am tempted, though every faction watches every twitch of allegiance like a spider tracking weight on the silken edge of its web.

In time, I meet Evanna, the Weaver of Hollow Songs—once a Luminary, now branded as heretic. Our exchange is silent, haptic; we communicate through sensory memory stolen from others. She shows me the origin story of the Eyes of the Night, the original betrayal that is never spoken aloud, about a leader who remembered what was erased… and tried to bring it back. I begin to understand: everything I am told to guard was once broken. Everything I am told to protect was once stolen.

And so begins a covert subversion unlike any they can imagine—not with blood, but with small mercies. I alter a ritual flourish to allow time for escape. I permit one initiate to keep a sliver of their memory, no more than a dream-green leaf. I leave a hidden parchment in the Hall of Whispers—the society’s vast archive carved from sky-fallen crystal—saying only: *Not all who remember are cursed.*

The dream begins to fray.

The Elders convene in silence, appearing not as people but as geometries of gray smoke. I dream that I am summoned to answer for my breaches. I prepare a defense written in the syntax of corrupted dreams. But as I speak—no, not speak: resonate—I begin to influence them not with logic, but by recall. I evoke the silken moment of their first choice—the first time they chose silence over truth. I open the floodgate just a little.

The dream shudders.

And in the distance, the Nosferic Bell tolls. Not rung, but wept. The sixth ring since the dawn of the order.

The dream is ending. I awaken into something older, stranger.

I do not return to where I was.

I awaken *into becoming*.

And the Eyes of the Night gaze back—not as masters, but as mirrored reflections of what they once were. Beginners, once. Lost. And ready to be led.
