I am dreaming. The colors are vibrant, like a stained glass window bathed in sunlight.  My feet are not on the ground—they hover an inch above a surface that isn’t quite solid, rippling like water but cool to the touch.  I’m floating past a labyrinth made of black walnutwood, its spiraling walls etched with symbols I recognize but can’t immediately name.  Each twist of the labyrinth mirrors the paths I’ve walked in waking life, decisions branching out like river deltas.  At the center, a glass orb hangs suspended, refracting light into prismatic patterns that dance across my skin.  I reach out, my hand passing through the orb, and inside, I see myself as a child, laughing in a sunlit meadow.  The symbols on the labyrinth walls pulse in rhythm with my heartbeat, growing brighter as I draw closer.  Suddenly, the orb shatters into countless shards, each reflecting a different version of me—scientist, artist, wanderer, each shard glowing with the possibility of a life unlived.  I wake with the taste of cedarwood on my tongue and the sensation of wings beating against my ribs.
