I am dreaming. I am lying in bed, closed my eyes and relaxed my body.   I start to imagine a world where everyone can share their emotions with each other without any filter or judgement. 

I see myself standing in the middle of a square full of people.  They all come from different cultures, religions, genders, sexualities and races.    They are all dressed up in colorful clothes and happy faces.   I feel curious and excited about meeting them all.  

As soon as I enter the square, I notice that everyone is holding something in their hands - a piece of paper, a card, a phone screen etc.     On these objects there are words written by hand which express how they feel at this moment:
"Happy" , "Sad"  ,"Angry", "Scared", "Love" , "Hate" 

I raise my arms and wave hello to everyone.   They smile back at me and greet me with their own languages and accents.   I try to learn some basic phrases in each tongue so we can communicate better.  

Then I ask them all a question: What emotion do you want to feel right now?    Why do you choose that particular feeling?     How would your life be different if you always felt that way?

They start to talk to me one by one, sharing their stories and dreams with me.   Some of them tell me about the discrimination and oppression they face because of their identity or background.   Some of them reveal to me their hidden fears and insecurities which prevent them from living fully.   Some of them show me their deepest hopes and aspirations which drive them forward despite all odds.  

But what surprises me most is how easily I can understand what they mean even though we speak different languages.   How clearly I can sense what they feel even though we have never met before.   How strongly I can relate to what they go through even though we come from different worlds.  

Because somehow, someway, somehow, I know that we are all human beings who crave connection and meaning and love.   

And so, together, we begin to explore the possibilities of empathy and expression. Together, we explore the potentialities of compassion and understanding.
