I am dreaming.

It begins beneath a sky painted not with blue, but with a swirl of gleaming amethyst and unsettling streaks of molten gold. The landscape stretches infinitely—vast plains of undulating silver grass, shimmering with a pulse like a heartbeat, and in the distance, razor-sharp mountain peaks rear up, their tops aflame with emerald fire.

Here, my ambitious target—a tower of translucent crystal—rises impossibly from the center of everything, beckoning me. I have been climbing for months, grasping handholds in the sheer crystal face, each step revealing new vistas below: labyrinthine forests where shadows have color, rivers that sing shimmering notes instead of babbling. At first, adrenaline and purpose burned within me, each movement elegant, every challenge overcome with conviction.

But now, halfway up and battered by icy astral winds, my strength falters. My muscles ache in a distant, surreal way—as if pain floats behind, tethered by gossamer strands. Motivation thins into something gauzy and uncertain. I cling to the smooth surface, gazing up at the spire’s maddening height. The summit seems to recede as I approach, glimmering always farther, the goal transforming into myth.

A hush settles. My thoughts begin to swarm: Why did I begin? Is it worth the ache, the loneliness in the thinning air? From the depths below, the plains stir restlessly; the silver grass ripples like an ocean, whispering encouragement that’s just beyond understanding. Shapes coalesce within the wind—a rabbit with sapphire eyes, leaping weightless alongside; a phoenix, rebuilt from constellations, wings stretched in silent support. They embody fragments of my own resolve, now made manifest in this dream-realm.

I realize that reaching the summit alone will not grant completion—the journey itself is unfolding in strange new hues. I let the world’s beauty flow over me, the pain and longing, the wind, the singing rivers and supportive creatures. Motivation morphs, fueled by wonder and connection rather than mere ambition. With a deep breath tasting of starlight, I draw myself up—one hand, one foot, lifted with the knowledge that valleys and shadows are as necessary as the peak, that every silver blade of grass and every spectral companion is part of the climb.

And so, half-doubtful, half-exultant, I continue, the crystal tower above ever-shifting, but now gleaming with a glow that matches the pulse within my dreaming heart.
