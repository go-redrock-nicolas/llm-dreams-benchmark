I am dreaming. …I find myself standing at the edge of an impossible coastline where the sea is not water at all but swirling indigo ink, flecked with pinpricks of starlight that drift upward instead of sinking. Each cresting wave whispers a phrase in a language I somehow understand only in feeling, not in words. Cool, fragrant wind—like crushed eucalyptus mixed with something sweet and ancient—brushes my hair back as if the night itself wants to see my face.

Far in the distance, a lighthouse leans at an angle no architect would dare, its spiraling brickwork studded with floating lanterns. I sense it calling me, but between us lies a strand of polished obsidian sand that shows reflections—not of the sky—but of all the stories I tell about myself. Every step I take forward triggers a memory on the mirror-black shore: “You are fragile.” I see myself shatter like brittle glass. “You are an imposter.” The reflection shrinks, hiding behind oversized shadows. “You never finish what you start.” Half-built bridges jut into a blank horizon, unfinished and abandoned.

The closer I come to the lighthouse, the louder these projected beliefs become, until they weave together into a single, suffocating chorus. My knees buckle beneath the weight of that sound, and it feels as though the sand itself is clawing at my ankles, trying to moor me to its shining surface. For an instant, panic flares: this must be truth—unchangeable, ironclad.

Yet just then, an enormous, silent gull made of parchment wings swoops overhead. As it glides, strips of written sentences peel away from its wings and whirl down around me like ticker-tape snow. One landing at my feet reads:

“The cage was always unlocked.”

I kneel, fingertips brushing the sentence, and the ink slips onto my skin, warm and alive. A quiet spark ignites behind my sternum—the kind of spark you feel on the cusp of a laugh you haven’t allowed yourself to voice. In that moment I recognize the chorus for what it is: a rehearsal, a well-practiced monologue, not a sacred scripture. The belief at the core—“I am fundamentally inadequate”—is suddenly naked, revealed as a story I inherited, rehearsed, repeated… but never truly examined.

I rise. The obsidian sand still mirrors my stories, but now I realize: mirrors only show what is placed before them. I inhale, and with the exhale I picture breath turning to wind. The reflections ripple, distort, and finally disintegrate into silver mist. The chorus quiets. The sand becomes ordinary, grainy, even warm.

With my next step I’m no longer trudging; I’m gliding, as though gravity has loosened its grip. The lighthouse door opens of its own accord. Inside, staircases spiral upward and downward simultaneously, as if honoring whichever direction I choose. I climb, feeling lighter with each turn. Along the inner wall, phosphorescent murals paint themselves in real time: moments in which I had believed the limiting story, now re-authored. Where I once shrank, the mural shows me standing tall. Where I withdrew, it shows me reaching outward.

At the summit, instead of a lantern room, there is an enormous glass sphere filled with luminous water. I step into it effortlessly; it feels like walking into a firm embrace rather than liquid. The sphere lifts from its cradle of stone and drifts through the lighthouse’s open roof. From this vantage, I look down to see that the indigo sea is actually the sky, and the sky is actually an ocean. Everything we name is only perspective.

A sudden surge of exhilaration bursts through me—effortless, electric. Freed from the belief of inadequacy, I sense unused chambers within myself unfolding like origami flowers dunked in warm tea. Possibilities bloom: languages I might learn, songs I might write, strangers I might turn into kin. Each idea flashes across the ink-sea below as constellations rearranging in fast-forward.

I stretch my arms, and the glass sphere dissolves into a billion fireflies. They scatter, leaving me buoyant in midair, borne not by wings but by the truth of my own unburdened momentum. I arc across the inverted sky-ocean, leaving a ribbon of shimmering gold behind me—signature of a dreamer newly awake within the dream.

And as I move, I carry a single crystalline clarity: the stories I tell about myself are instruments, not verdicts. Today, liberated, I pick the instrument that sings of expansion, curiosity, and quiet, unwavering worth.
