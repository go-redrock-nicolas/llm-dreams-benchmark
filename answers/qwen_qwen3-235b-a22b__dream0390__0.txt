I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the static of forgotten memories, and you stand at the edge of a vast library suspended in the sky—a place you’ve never been, yet somehow know by heart. Shelves twist into spirals that pierce clouds, their spines etched with titles like *“You Are Not Enough”* and *“This Is How You Fail.”* The books whisper in your childhood voice, reciting rules you absorbed before you could speak: *“Don’t reach. Don’t risk. Don’t let them see the real you.”* But tonight, the dream rebels.  

A flicker of gold catches your eye—a key, floating midair, glowing like a trapped star. You reach for it, and the shelves shudder, their chains rattling as if to stop you. But your fingers close around the key, and the library dissolves into ash.  

Now you’re falling—not into darkness, but into a kaleidoscope of liquid light. Colors scream past: the crimson of every time you hid your voice, the indigo of nights spent doubting your worth. You hit the ground with a splash, and the light solidifies into a city of mirrors. Towers reflect versions of yourself you buried: a child who once painted galaxies on bedroom walls, a teenager who dared to love someone wild and unkind, a version of you that *chose differently* in moments that defined your path. The reflections glare, accusing, until you step toward one. The glass ripples like water. You plunge your hand through—*shatter*—and the shards rise, stitching into wings on your back.  

The city crumbles. You ascend.  

Above, the sky is a living mosaic of every “impossible” you’ve ever swallowed. Mountains float upside down, their peaks dripping waterfalls that evaporate into doves. Trees grow in spirals, their roots clawing at the air, their branches digging into the soil of some inverted earth. You land on a bridge made of breath and moonlight, where a figure waits—neither man nor woman, neither young nor old. Their face is a mosaic of your own, but unburdened, *alight*.  

“You built these walls,” they say, their voice echoing like a chorus of freed birds. “Now tear them down.”  

You turn, and the horizon splits open. Behind you, the ruins of your fears; ahead, a forest where trees bloom with beating hearts, their petals singing in harmonies that make your bones ache. You run, tearing through the undergrowth, each step unearthing memories you’d locked away: the time you laughed until you cried, the stranger who told you you were brave, the poem you wrote at 14 that still hums in your blood. The forest drinks these memories, growing taller, brighter, until you’re swallowed by its canopy.  

Here, gravity forgets you. You float, untethered, as constellations bloom across your skin—each star a truth you’d buried: *You are capable. You are allowed. You are more than the sum of your scars.*  

A dragon appears, not of scales, but of smoke and forgotten apologies. It roars, and its voice is your father’s, your ex-lover’s, your own: *“You’ll never be ready. You’ll never be worthy.”* But you press your palm to its smoldering heart, and the smoke unravels, becoming a flock of monarch butterflies that carry the words *“I forgive you”* into the void.  

The dream shifts again. You’re back in your childhood bedroom, but the walls are gone. Outside, the world is a canvas of infinite doors—each one a possibility you once deemed impossible. You open one. Beyond it: a life where you became a dancer. Another: a life where you spoke your truth without trembling. Another: a life where love did not terrify you. You step through none, all, *and understand*—these are not fantasies. They are fragments of who you could still become.  

The dream fades, but its heat lingers in your bones.  

When you wake, the air smells of burning paper and wild jasmine. The rules you once obeyed feel brittle now, like old spiderwebs brushed aside by a hand that no longer trembles.
