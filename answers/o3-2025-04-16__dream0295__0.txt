I am dreaming. …find yourself standing on the edge of an impossibly vast salt-white desert, beneath a sky the iridescent color of abalone shell. The wind chimes with distant, unfamiliar constellations that drift and reform like living calligraphy. Each grain of sand beneath your bare feet seems to hum with memories, reverberating up through your bones.

In the distance, a lone figure approaches. Their outline shimmers, at first no more substantial than a heat mirage. As they draw nearer, the desert floor ripples into a mirror-smooth lake, and the stranger steps onto its surface as though it were glass. You recognize them: the one who once wounded you so deeply that even waking mornings sometimes feel bruised with the old ache. 

Their expression is neither pleading nor proud—only utterly open, like a door in a night of locked houses. When they speak, their voice arrives as ripples of silver light across the water: “I have carried my wrongdoing like lead, and it has bent my spine. I ask not for erasure, but for the chance to set that lead gently down at your feet. Will you let me try?” 

The question hangs in the air, materializing above you as a scale of luminous crystal, its pans empty, trembling. In the left pan, the shards of your pain clatter into place: nights spent questioning your worth, the sharp corners of old conversations, the clench in your chest each time the memory stirred. In the right pan, you glimpse the promise of release—an open window, a field of green after fire, the cool hush of rain that follows a long drought.

The scale tips back and forth while the desert-turned-lake stirs under a gathering wind. Colors spill from the sky—turquoise forgiveness, amethyst sorrow, gold hope—swirling into a towering funnel that descends toward you both. The moment stretches, vibrating with choice.

You close your eyes and press a palm to your sternum, feeling the pulse of ancient hurt. It beats in time with the soft thud of the earth’s own heart. Then, in a motion that feels like tearing a bandage from flesh yet also like unfurling wings, you exhale. Your breath becomes a flock of white moths that flutter upward, shedding dust that glitters like morning frost.

The moths settle on the left pan of the scale—the side weighted with pain—and dissolve it into light. Unburdened, the scale merges into the storm of colors above, which instantly softens into dawn hues. The lake turns back to desert, but now it blooms with fragile blue flowers every few steps. You look at the once-stranger, now merely human, and nod.

They sink to their knees, tears falling onto the crystalline petals at their feet. You lift them up gently. In the space between you, a fresh path unfurls—silver, winding, uncertain, yet undeniably real. Together you step onto it, the scent of new rain mingling with distant birdsong as the dream dissolves into a warm, forgiving light.
