I am dreaming. Or is this the dream within a dream? The air shimmers like liquid mercury, making solid forms melt at the edges. My footsteps echo as I walk down a hallway with infinite doors, each painted a different shade of regret. The floor is scattered with broken things—porcelain doll heads, torn love letters still damp with old tears, the jagged halves of promises made but abandoned.  

At the end of the corridor, my own reflection glares back at me from a cracked mirror—except this version of me is fractured into shards that shift whenever I try to grasp them. *"You always do this,"* whispers the reflection, multiplied into a chorus of voices—lovers I’ve pushed away, friends I’ve ghosted, people who trusted me until the sharp edges of my fear cut them loose.  

The walls shudder, and suddenly I’m in each moment I swore I wouldn’t repeat: storming out of a conversation before it could hurt, building emotional armor while someone tenderly reaches for me, sabotaging closeness the second it feels real. The scenes flicker like a projector stuck on the same reel—same wounds, different faces.  

A flutter of wings fills the air—black moths, their powdery wings brushing my skin, dissolving into ash where they land. One lands on my palm and unfolds into a tiny scroll: *"The lock fits the same key. Turn it."*  

Then, the hallway tilts, gravity warping, and from the abyss below rises an enormous hourglass—half-filled with my own handwriting, the other half with someone else’s cursive dissolving mid-word. I know if I don’t shatter the glass before it runs out, I’ll wake up forgetting again.  

But as my fist connects—  

**I hear my own voice, raw and quiet, murmur: *"What if you stayed this time?"***  

And the world goes white.
