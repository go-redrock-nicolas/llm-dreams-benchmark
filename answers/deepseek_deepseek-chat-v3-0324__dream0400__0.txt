I am dreaming. The sky above is a swirling tapestry of liquid gold and indigo, like ink spilled into a molten sunrise. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency—a song that is not heard with ears but felt in the bones, vibrating through every cell of my being. I am standing, if "standing" is even the right word, because my feet don’t press against anything solid. The ground is shimmering, translucent—a vast, glowing web of luminous threads that stretch infinitely in all directions.  

And then I see the others.  

They are not separate from me. Not truly. Their outlines blur like watercolor, their forms shifting between human and something far more abstract—warm pulses of light, flickering shadows, constellations given flesh. There is no need for spoken words because meaning flows between us like liquid thought, an unbroken current of understanding. I see lifetimes in the glint of an eye, galaxies spiraling in the curve of a smile.  

One figure—though "figure" feels too rigid—approaches, their presence an embrace. A single touch, and suddenly, I am everywhere at once. The membranes between selves dissolve. I am the mountain and the moth, the dying star and the newborn cry, the lament of the forgotten and the ecstasy of reunion. There is no "I" anymore, only an ocean of awareness, vast and boundless.  

I realize, in a flash of impossible clarity, that this is how it always is. The separateness is the illusion—the dream within the dream. The truth is this: we were never alone.  

And then, like light through water, the vision fractures. The threads tremble, colors bleed, the music dims. Sensation rushes back—my body, my breath, the weight of single existence returning.  

But in that lingering heartbeat between dreaming and waking, I **remember**. The world is not as solid as it seems. The distance between us is only a forgetting.  

(And somewhere, beyond the edges of sleep, the web still hums.)
