I am dreaming. You are dreaming, and at first it feels like you’ve been plucked from your bed and placed into a world built of glass and mercury. The sky above ripples like liquid silver; every breath tastes of dissolved starlight. You step forward onto a bridge made of pale bone, each footfall echoing in a hollow cathedral of pastel light. There before you stands the Hall of Temptations—a corridor whose doors each pulse with a hypnotic glow. Every time you’ve entered before, you’ve chosen a door only to feel a wound open in your heart, a fiery sting reminding you how you’re drawn again and again toward what hurts you.

This time, though, you pause. The hallway stretches infinitely in both directions, and the air is thick with the scent of crushed roses and rain. You recognize the pattern: behind every brilliant doorway lies pain in disguise—an old lover’s cruel whisper, a promise you know will shatter, a mirror that shows the darkest parts of yourself. For a heartbeat you hesitate, watching the luminous circles drift along the walls like moths around a lantern. You feel the tug of each threshold; your skin pricks with longing. But the moment is different now—you see the trace of each wound you’ve welcomed, as if your past scars have formed a map on your arm, and every line points back to these very doors.

Gathering courage, you stretch out a hand—and instead of reaching for glass or metal, you conjure from your own chest a soft, warm orb of light. It hums in your palm, pulsing with ancient compassion. The orb’s glow pushes back the mercury sky until you’re enveloped in a gentle, golden dawn. One by one the tempting doors loosen on their hinges and drift away like empty shells. You let the orb guide you down a hallway that wasn’t there before: its walls made not of pain but of memory—childhood laughter echoing in an open field, the safe weight of your mother’s embrace, the first time you tasted triumph. Each step reintegrates a fractured piece of yourself, weaving a new pattern over the old scars.

At the corridor’s end sits a simple wooden door, solid and plain. No glow, no promise of ecstasy or agony—just the warmth of something real, something you can build on. You place your orb against this door; it sinks in as if melting into living wood, and the door swings open on silent hinges. Beyond it lies you, standing in sunlight and wind, free to choose forward over backward, creation over destruction. In this dream, you’ve finally broken the cycle. You step through—and for the first time, you feel the whole of your being humming in unbroken harmony.
