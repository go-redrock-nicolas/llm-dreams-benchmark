I am dreaming. …close your eyes inside the dream-court and let silence fall like a velvet curtain. The chamber is an impossible place: miles high, yet intimate as a whisper, its walls made of shifting constellations where stars rearrange themselves into runic patterns each time an advocate speaks. The floor is a mirror of obsidian-smooth water, reflecting galaxies overhead, so every footstep sends concentric ripples through the heavens. At the room’s center, a floating prism of crystal pulses with slow, thunder-huge heartbeats—this is the Arbiter’s Seat, and in this reverie you are the one who must occupy it.

Two delegations stand before you.

On the left: the Choral Guild of the Silent Future, luminous figures woven from translucent parchment and echoing song. Their argument is harmony: they insist that every sentient voice deserves a place in a universal symphony, even those that threaten dissonance now, because the symphony is not yet finished; what seems dissonant today can resolve into beauty tomorrow.

On the right: the Order of the Vigilant Seed, beings encased in warm loam and green light, sprouting petals with every breath. They plead for preservation: they protect fragile worlds from seeds of chaos, believing that some voices must be gently hushed before they grow into storms that can uproot entire ecosystems of possibility.

Each side presents memories as evidence. The Choral Guild lets a ghostly overture unfurl—whole civilizations singing their mistakes into lullabies that cradle newborn peace. The Vigilant Seed responds with visions of verdant worlds turned to ash because one discordant note was let free to crescendo unchecked.

These testimonies swirl around you as living murals, sinking into the mirrored floor, blooming overhead, rewriting constellations. You feel both cases settle in your ribs like twin suns, warmth dueling warmth, until the orbit of your own conscience threatens to fracture.

Finally, you rise, the crystal prism accepting you with a sigh like breaking glass. It dissolves into a cloak of prismatic threads around your shoulders. You speak—but the words are not words; they are fragments of sunrise translated into sound:

“Let there be a guiding melody and a patient gardener.”

In the dream’s logic, this verdict means neither side wins alone. You decree a middle path: voices may sing, yet the gardeners may prune—a council of resonance and restraint. You instruct them to convene at dawn on every world they touch, so that the first light, impartial and unowned, may witness each case. A seed will sprout only with a lullaby sung by guardians and choristers together, and any note deemed too wild will be taught harmony before it is silenced.

As you finish, the mirror-water floor lifts you upward in a spiraling column. The courtroom’s stars rearrange one last time into a new symbol: a seed inside a musical clef, glowing brighter than a supernova, gentle as breath. The delegations bow—roots dipping, parchment wings folding—and drift away to carry out your balanced decree.

The dream dissolves into feather-soft darkness. You hover in weightless afterglow, hearing a far-off chorus weaving through rustling leaves. And just before waking, you realize: the verdict was carved not in stone, but in possibility—alive, evolving, like a song that never truly ends.
