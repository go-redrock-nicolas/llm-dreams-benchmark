I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world, full of colors and sounds.  I see flowers blooming, birds singing, and bees buzzing.  I smell fresh air and earthy scent.  I feel happy and free. 

But then I realize something is wrong.  I've been checking social media too much.  I've been spending too much time online.  I've been ignoring my real life and my dreams. 

I don't know how it happened.  I don't know why I did it.  I just know that I need to stop. 

So I decide to do something about it.  I make a plan to break my addiction to social media.  I tell myself that today will be different.  

Today, I will not check social media at all.  Today, I will do things that make me happy in real life.  Today, I will explore new places and meet new people. 

I start by turning off my phone and laptop.  I put them away in a drawer where they can't distract me.  I feel a sense of relief and freedom already. 

Then I go outside into the garden.  I sit down on a bench under a tree.  I listen to the sound of leaves rustling and birds chirping.  I watch the sun shining through the branches and creating patterns on the ground.  

I take a deep breath and feel my body relax.  I close my eyes and imagine what kind of dream I want to have tonight. 

I want to dream about being with my friends again.  I miss them so much.  We used to laugh together, play together, learn together.  But then we drifted apart because of social media and other things.  

In my dream, I will see their faces clearly.  I will hear their voices distinctly.  I will feel their hands touching mine gently.  

We will talk about anything and everything.  We will share our hopes, fears, dreams, frustrations.  We will listen to each other without judging or criticizing.  

We will play games together that require cooperation and creativity.  We will solve problems together that challenge our minds and hearts.  We will learn new things together that expand our horizons and perspectives. 

We will also eat food together that tastes delicious and nourishes us physically as well as emotionally.  We will drink tea or coffee or juice or milkshakes that quench our thirsts and satisfy our cravings.  

And when we're done, we'll lie down on the grass and stargaze together until we fall asleep.  We'll curl up next to each other like puppies and wake up together in the morning. 

That's what I want to dream about tonight.

How do you feel about that?
