I am dreaming. You find yourself in a grand, crumbling amphitheater, the marble columns and stone seats weathered by time. The air is thick with an ancient tension as you stand before two delegations, representatives of rival factions who have been locked in enmity for centuries. Theia Veterans, led by a grizzled warrior with a mechanical hand, and the  (Xu-du) Coterie, comprising cloaked figures with glowing tattoos, glare at each other across a rift too deep to be readily bridged.

The veteran on the right speaks first, his voice like gravel. "These accursed cultists have desecrated the sacred shrines of our forebears! They must be rooted out, their tainted followers driven into the ground like the vermin they are."

A heavily veiled figure from the left council responds, exotic charms dangling ominously from their cloak. "And the veterans are nothing but reckless brutes, burning our sacred groves to cinders and enslaving our people. Their brutality knows no bounds."

The two sides present demands that are mutually exclusive - unconditional surrender, expulsion, retribution, and amnesty. Angry shots ring out as the mood turns volatile. Weapons are drawn from the shadows.

Suddenly, an ethereal basilisk slithers out from under your chair. You realize that the Creature is the only one capable of bridging the gap. The basilisk begins to speak in an ancient tongue, eloquent and poetic, weaving a tale of shared origins and common adversity that over the centuries has been forgotten.

You look around to see both sides listening in rapt attention as the Creature spins its ancient tapestry of history. Emphasizing the need for reconciliation and the avoidance of destruction. It speaks of a core shared between both factions that once sought to live in peace.

As the realization dawns on both sides of their shared past and the need for peace, the tensions ease. Rifles are lowered. Hands that were ready to strike, start to open. Weapons are once again sheathed, tucked and retracted. Crossed in a show of friendship.

You feel a wave of relief cascading over you as both factions rise, clasping hands and patting each other on the back. The amphitheater that was once shrouded in anger is now bathed in a warm sapphire light. There is a new dawn rising in these two lands brought together at last. You feel an explosion of peace spreading across whole lands.

You wake with a grin stretching across your face. It's quite a dream.
