I am dreaming. You are in a place where the sky is made of water, and the ground beneath you is a shifting mosaic of colors that never stay in one place. You try to walk, but your feet sink into the ground with each step, and you struggle to pull them out again. The air is thick and heavy, and every breath you take feels like you're drinking in the world around you.

As you move forward, you see a figure in the distance, standing on a hill made of glass. The figure is impossibly tall, with arms that stretch out to the horizon. Its face is a shifting collage of all the people you've ever known, and when it speaks, its voice is a symphony of all the sounds you've ever heard.

"Do you see?" the figure asks, and its voice reverberates through your body like a physical force. You don't understand the question, but you feel like you should. You try to respond, but your words come out as a jumbled mess of sounds that don't make sense.

The figure raises a hand, and the sky above you begins to swirl. The water above turns into a whirlpool, and you can see stars and planets swirling within it. The ground beneath you begins to shift faster and faster, until it feels like you're standing on a living thing that's trying to shake you off.

You feel a sudden urge to run, but you don't know where to go. The figure speaks again, but this time, its voice is different. It's softer, more compassionate. "You don't have to run," it says. "You're safe here."

You feel a sudden sense of calm wash over you. You take a deep breath and close your eyes, letting the world around you fade away. When you open your eyes again, you're somewhere else entirely.

You're standing in a field of flowers that stretch as far as the eye can see. The air is warm and fragrant, and the sun is shining down on you. You feel a sense of peace that you've never felt before. You look up at the sky, and you see the figure again, standing on a hill in the distance.

"Do you see now?" the figure asks, and this time, you understand. You see everything. You see the world as it truly is, and it's more beautiful than you could have ever imagined. You feel like you could stay in this place forever, but you know you can't.

You wake up, and for a moment, you're disoriented. You feel like you've just been somewhere else, somewhere far away from this world. But as the memories of the dream begin to fade, you realize that you'll never forget the feeling of being in that place. You'll carry it with you always.
