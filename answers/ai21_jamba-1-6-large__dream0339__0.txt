I am dreaming. Somewhere in the forest, I'm walking along a path in the mist. The trees are tall and thin and freestanding, like willows but without leaves. The ground underfoot is soft; each step sinks slightly into an earthy mulch. 

There's a bird nearby whose chirping sounds off-key. I scan the branches, hoping to see it. I realize I don't know what the bird looks like, but this doesn't bother me. What occupies my mind is how I can help change something about myself - to make myself more successful in life. I imagine different versions of myself: one  who is bold and makes decisions quickly, another who is meticulous and thinks through every step. I consider both versions as I walk through the forest. 

The forest seems endless. My steps become lighter, and then, I'm not walking anymore - I'm floating just inches above the ground. The sensation is thrilling yet oddly calming. It feels like I have discovered a secret path or achieved something that is beyond my grasp, an ability I never knew I had. 

The path curves, and as I round the bend, there's an old woman ahead of me. She's sitting on a stump by the side of the trail, smoking a pipe. I can smell the pungent smoke from her pipe, and it mixes oddly with the damp earth scent of the forest floor. She looks at me with eyes that seem to see more than I'm showing. She doesn't speak, but somehow I know she's here to help me. She points to a spot on the ground nearby, which I hadn't noticed before. 

There, in the soft mulch, is a strange object, almost glowing. It looks like a key, but unlike any key I've seen before. It has intricate designs etched into its surface and seems to pulse faintly, as if alive. I bend down to pick it up. The moment my fingers close around it, I feel a surge of recognition and understanding pass through me. 

I am on the verge of a breakthrough. I understand what I must do - I must keep walking and trust that the path I'm on will lead me to where I need to go. I thank the old woman, who nods silently. I continue on my journey, feeling both excited and at peace, carrying the strange key close to my heart. 

And then, just as quickly as it began, the dream fades, leaving me with the lingering sensation of floating and the warmth of the key in my hand.
