I am dreaming. You find yourself transported to another planet where the environment and physical laws are different from Earth. To survive in this alien world, you have to learn how to fly using your imagination.

You see a group of colorful creatures who can fly freely in the sky. They invite you to join them and teach you their secret technique. 

You focus on your heartbeat and breathing, imagining yourself rising above the ground without any effort. You visualize the wind rushing past your body and feel the freedom of flight. You hear a loud whooshing sound as you slowly leave the ground behind. 

You continue to imagine yourself rising higher and higher until you break through the atmosphere into space. The beauty of the cosmos surrounds you as you soar among distant stars and galaxies. Suddenly, you wake up from your dream feeling refreshed and invigorated. You remember that anything is possible if you believe in yourself and trust your imagination.
