I am dreaming. I find myself drifting through a realm where the fabric of time is woven in reverse, like a tapestry unravelling thread by thread. The air is alive with the whispered echoes of moments yet to come, and the sky is a deep, foreboding shade of indigo, as if the very hue of time itself has been turned upside down. I am standing in the midst of a city that appears to be dismantling itself, brick by brick, beam by beam. Buildings that were once proud and tall now shrink back into the earth, their steel and stone exteriors morphing into a molten, liquid-like state that flows seamlessly into the ground.

As I navigate this topsy-turvy world, I realize that even the simplest actions require a profound understanding of the reverse causality that governs this dimension. To accomplish even basic tasks, I must first envision the outcome, and then work my way back through the sequence of events that led to it. It's as if I'm trying to solve a puzzle in reverse, where the solution appears first, and the pieces that led to it are only revealed afterwards.

I attempt to take a sip of water, but my hand doesn't move towards the glass until the liquid has already been absorbed back into the container, and the glass itself has returned to its original, empty state. The act of drinking has become an undoing, where the water un-flows from my lips, back into the glass, and then back into the faucet, where it un-flows once more, returning to its source.

As I wander through this surreal landscape, I come across a figure who introduces himself as the Keeper of the Inverse. He explains that, in this reality, effects precede their causes, and that every action is, in fact, a reaction to an event that has not yet occurred. He shows me a garden where flowers un-bloom, their petals retreating back into the stem, and then further, into the seed that spawned them. The seeds themselves then un-germinate, returning to the earth, where they un-sprout, and the soil un-tills itself, restoring the land to its original, pristine state.

The Keeper leads me to a great, crystal palace that appears to be disintegrating, its facets shattering and reforming in a dazzling display of reverse entropy. Inside, I find a hall of mirrors that reflect not my physical appearance, but the accumulated memories of my past, each one unraveling like a spool of thread unwinding from a great, cosmic loom. The reflections show me moments from my life that I've yet to experience, and I realize that, in this world, the future is not something that awaits me, but rather something that I'm constantly undoing, thread by thread, moment by moment.

As I delve deeper into this dream world, I begin to grasp the underlying logic of this inverted reality. I start to see that every event, every action, and every decision is, in fact, a precursor to a cause that has not yet been born. The experience is both exhilarating and terrifying, like standing at the edge of a great, precipitous cliff, staring into the abyss of time itself. And yet, as I stand there, the dream begins to shift and ripple, like the surface of a pond disturbed by a thrown stone. The images begin to blur and fade, and I feel myself being pulled back, thread by thread, into the world I knew before, where time flows forward, and cause precedes effect. The dream dissolves, leaving me with a sense of wonder, and a profound appreciation for the mysterious, ever-unraveling tapestry of time itself.
