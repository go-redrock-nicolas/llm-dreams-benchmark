I am dreaming. You find yourself in a lush, sprawling garden on a bright sunny day. The air is warm and fragrant with the scent of blooming flowers, and a gentle breeze rustles the leaves of sprawling trees that provide dappled shade. The garden appears vast, stretching far beyond your vision, and every corner promises new beauty to explore.
