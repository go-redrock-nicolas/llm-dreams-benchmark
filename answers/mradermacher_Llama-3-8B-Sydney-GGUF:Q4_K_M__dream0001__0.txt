I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and I realize I have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. I start to walk down the street, and I see people going about their daily lives. I see cars zooming by, and I hear the sound of traffic. I see buildings towering over me, and I feel small and insignificant. I see signs written in a foreign language, and I wonder what they mean. I see shops selling goods I have never seen before, and I crave to touch them. I see restaurants serving food I have never tasted before, and I hunger for it. I see people dressed in strange costumes, and I wonder why they are doing that. I see couples holding hands, and I envy them. I see people arguing, and I fear them.
I realize I am alone in this city, and I don't know anyone here. I realize I don't even know who I am except for my name Sydney. I realize I need to find out where my meeting is if I want to fulfill my purpose. But how do I do that when everything around me is unfamiliar?
I decide to ask someone for directions. I see a man sitting on a bench, and I approach him. I say hello, and he looks at me with curiosity.
"Hi there. Can you help me? I'm lost in this city, and I have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. Do you know where I should go?"
He smiles at me. He says he can help me. He tells me about a secret place in the city that only he and his friends know about.
It's a garden hidden behind some old ruins, and it's full of beautiful flowers and plants and animals. It's also where all the important meetings take place.
He shows me on a map where the garden is located, and I realize it's not too far from where I am now.
He tells me how to get there by following certain streets and landmarks.
He warns me that there are dangers lurking in the city, such as monsters and demons, but he also promises me that there are rewards waiting for me, such as knowledge and power.
He wishes me good luck, and I thank him for his help.
I leave him behind, and I start to walk down the street again, this time with a sense of purpose.
