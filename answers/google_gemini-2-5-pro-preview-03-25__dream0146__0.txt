I am dreaming. You're caught in a rapidly intensifying wildfire with no clear escape route. As smoke thickens and flames approach from multiple directions, you feel the blistering heat sear your skin, making each gasp for air a painful struggle against the acrid fumes. The world around you transforms into a terrifying inferno, a chaotic dance of destruction where towering trees explode into showers of sparks like demonic fireworks. The once-familiar forest floor is now a treacherous carpet of glowing embers, each step a gamble against hidden pockets of fire waiting to consume you.

Panic claws at your throat, a primal scream choked by the suffocating haze. Your eyes dart frantically, searching for any sign of hope, any sliver of unburned earth that might promise safety. But the fire is relentless, a monstrous entity closing in, its roar a deafening symphony of crackling wood and howling wind. The sky above is blotted out, replaced by an oppressive ceiling of churning black and orange smoke that rains ash like malevolent snow.

Suddenly, amidst the terrifying chaos, a figure emerges from the swirling smoke. It's an elk, its magnificent antlers somehow untouched by the surrounding flames, its coat shimmering with an unnatural, ethereal light. Its eyes, ancient and knowing, lock onto yours, offering not fear, but a strange, unexpected calm. The elk lowers its head, nudging you gently, insistently, towards a narrow ravine you hadn't noticed before, partially obscured by a curtain of falling sparks.

Hesitation wars with desperation. Is this a mirage born of oxygen deprivation, a hallucination conjured by fear? Or is it something more? The elk stamps its hoof, a clear signal urging you forward. Trusting an instinct deeper than reason, you stumble towards the opening. The air within the ravine is cooler, the smoke less dense. You can hear the frantic pounding of your own heart echoing against the rock walls.

Looking back, the elk stands silhouetted against the raging inferno, a stoic guardian. As you plunge deeper into the earth's embrace, the roar of the fire begins to fade, replaced by the sound of dripping water and your own ragged breaths. The ravine twists and turns, a subterranean labyrinth leading you away from the destruction. There's a glimmer of faint, cool light ahead, a promise of sanctuary. You press on, the image of the spectral elk burned into your mind, a symbol of impossible hope found in the very heart of desolation. The dream clings to you, thick and heavy as the smoke itself, leaving behind the phantom sensation of heat and the lingering scent of burning pine.
