I am dreaming. …I inhale star-dusted air and step onto the quivering deck of an impossible ship. It isn’t floating on water—it slides along a river of liquid moonlight that flickers through a sky the color of deep-sea jade. Beneath the translucent planks, constellations swirl like plankton, pulsing each time my crew’s boots strike the floorboards.

My “team” is a curious mix—an astronomer in a cloak stitched from pages of obsolete atlases; a cartographer whose compass needle always points toward the loudest heartbeat; a botanist carrying a terrarium of singing moss; and an engineer whose limbs are half-gilded clockwork, gears ticking like nervous teeth. All of them stare at me, waiting—even the moss hushes its whistles—because the protocols etched into their memories have shattered like glass. The river of moonlight has left every navigational chart blank, wiped the stars from their usual positions, and silenced the automatic guidance systems that once whispered instructions in their ears.

Ahead, the river funnels into a vortex of prismatic rain. The whirlpool in the sky chews up bolts of lightning and spits out steaming rainbows that burn whatever they touch. Our instruments refuse to interpret the chaos: the astronomer’s star-maps reorder themselves into illegible spirals; the engineer’s gauges spin so fast the needles blur; the cartographer’s compass splinters, unsure where “north” hides in a storm that constantly redraws reality itself.

A single rule remains intact: whatever decisions I make become law inside this dream. The luxury of hesitation is gone; the vortex is widening, and each second of indecision peels another plank off the ship, sending it tumbling into the bright abyss below.

So I exhale, tasting ozone and possibility, and let instinct shoulder aside fear.

1. Break the Deck Apart  
I command the engineer to release the golden rivets that hold the ship’s bones together. He wrenches them free; the deck blossoms like a wooden lotus, each petal a flying platform. Everyone grabs a segment. The botanist’s moss resonates with the same frequency as moonlight, giving her plank buoyancy. The astronomer scribbles new constellations in the air, and each line becomes a tethering rope of silver ink. Together we leap from the failing vessel and scatter across the sky, riding our fragments like surfers on glowing surfboards.

2. Plant a Pathway  
The botanist dashes handfuls of singing moss into the churning vortex. Where the emerald clumps land, they root in clouds, instantly growing luminous vines that braid themselves into a bridge. The moss hums a harmony that steadies our heartbeats; my crew’s terror tampers down to urgent focus.

3. Reforge the Compass  
I tell the cartographer to listen—not with ears, but with the pulse of his own blood. Amid the vortex’s roar, he picks up a low thrumming, the heartbeat of the entire sky-river. He dips his shattered compass needle into the prismatic rain; the metal melts, reforms, and reemerges as a glass dagger that always points toward equilibrium. Balance, not direction, is our new north.

4. Rewrite the Stars  
The astronomer draws eight new constellations, each named after a feeling we need: Courage, Improvisation, Trust, Curiosity, Resolve, Adaptation, Calm, and Joy. They ignite overhead, bright enough to cut through the storm’s tantrum. Their alignment projects a grid of light across the sky-river, giving us reference points where none existed.

5. Create the Harmonizing Engine  
The engineer unstraps the brass heart ticking inside his chest and places it at the center of the vine bridge. With every click, the heart synchronizes disparate vibrations—the crackle of lightning, the hiss of rain, the blood in our ears—into a rhythm we can move with. The storm’s tempo matches ours now, instead of the other way around.

We sprint across the glowing bridge. The prismatic rain scalds our boots, but the harmonizing engine dulls the heat; the new stars keep the path illuminated; the compass-dagger quivers, guiding us to pockets of stability in the maelstrom. Midway through, the vortex belches a dragon made entirely of negative space, its outline slicing holes in reality. Its roar is silence itself. Fear tries to slither back into our bones.

I respond by inventing a rule: “Anything daring enough to claim a name must respect a plea for dialogue.” I name the void-dragon “Absolution,” and, bound by dream-law, it pauses to listen. I ask it to share the secret that tames storms. It exhales an orb of condensed hush, and in that sphere we hear a single instruction: “Synchronize your inner weather, and outer chaos obeys.”

Holding that silence in my palm, I blow it across my crew. Our breathing unifies; our thoughts braid; even the singing moss falls quiet. The vortex loses interest—it can’t compete with a team that has become its own calm ecosystem. The spiraling winds thin, the rain dims to a sprinkle, and the river of moonlight settles into a placid lane of silver glass.

On the far side, a new horizon fans out: archipelagos of floating amber, islands cracked with violet lava, skies swirling with inkblot birds. Fresh problems will certainly bloom there; the protocols we broke today might fail tomorrow. But my crew now carries improvised stars in their pockets, and I feel a private sunrise under my ribs—the knowledge that leadership here is not a matter of flawless plans, only relentless imagination.

I wake the instant my foot touches stable ground, the taste of ozone lingering like a promise.
