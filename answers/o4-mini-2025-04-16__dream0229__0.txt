I am dreaming. You feel yourself drifting on currents of light and color—an endless sky rippling like liquid glass beneath your eyelids. A soft breeze, scented with lavender and ozone, carries you toward a city suspended on pillars of gleaming pearl. The air here hums with gentle song. No one frowns. No one weeps. Every face glows with serene confidence.

As you walk wide-eyed through avenues paved in shifting mosaics, you see what this society has wrought: every form of personal suffering carefully unraveled and removed. Grief is woven into tapestries that hang in communal halls, where it can be observed and studied but never lived again. Pain is distilled into a translucent nectar that members sip once, acknowledge fully, and then set aside—never to revisit the pang of loss or the ache of longing. Anxiety is cataloged in floating spheres of pale green light that drift through the air like fireflies, admired for their fragile beauty but never allowed to settle in a single mind.

In the heart of the city, you arrive at a grand pavilion whose arches seem carved from liquid dawn. Here, the Elders of Empathy—the keepers of this painless world—stand in a circle, hands extended. Their skin shimmers with a soft radiance, and their eyes hold no shadows. They welcome you with voices like chimes:

“Traveler from beyond our gates,” they say, “you carry hidden scars we can heal. We would invite you to integrate fully with our collective harmony, to share in this gift of peace.”

A slender stream of light flows from the center of the circle, coalescing into an orb about the size of your heart. Inside it, you see your own history: a montage of stumbles and triumphs, tears cried in darkness, laughter echoing like sunlight. The orb pulses, beckoning you to place a palm against its surface. If you do, it promises to absorb every fragment of pain, replace it with crystalline calm—and in return, you will become one with their shared mind: every thought, every memory, every flicker of desire transparent and interwoven.

As they invite you to integrate fully, you feel a shiver in your core. The orb’s glow intensifies, painting your skin in hues of rose and gold. You imagine stepping forward and letting all your fears dissolve—never again to know heartbreak, loneliness, or regret. Yet at the same time, you sense a vast emptiness opening behind that promise: the quiet surrender of your secret self. The joys you treasure, the lessons learned from mistakes, even the vulnerability that makes you feel alive—would they vanish in that flawless unity?

For a heartbeat, the chamber holds its breath. The air trembles with possibility. You stand at the threshold between two worlds: one of unbroken peace, another of imperfect freedom. Your hand hovers just above the orb’s surface, fingertips tingling in the radiant glow. In that moment, you realize the greatest ache of all might be the loss of choice itself.

And then—before you can decide—your vision shivers. The brilliant pavilion dissolves. The high, untroubled voices fade into a whisper. You wake with a start, lying in the dark hush of your own room. Your heart pounds, your skin still tingling with that strange warmth. The dream lingers, unanswered: Would you surrender your suffering to gain perfect peace, or hold fast to every shadow and spark that makes you undeniably, beautifully yourself?
