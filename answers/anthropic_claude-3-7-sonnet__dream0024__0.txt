I am dreaming. I awaken to find myself in my familiar bedroom, yet something is undeniably different. The quality of light streaming through the curtains has an unusual hue—more violet than gold—and the air feels charged with an unfamiliar electricity.

When I step outside, the transformation is undeniable. People walk backward down the streets, their clothes worn inside out, vibrant colors blazing against the morning light. Street signs have been replaced with abstract paintings, and traffic flows in circular patterns around sculptural installations where stoplights once stood.

A neighbor notices my forward gait and gasps, hurriedly approaching me with concern etched across her face. "You're walking forward!" she whispers urgently. "They'll see you! Don't you know? The Reversal happened while we slept—everything is now its opposite."

She quickly teaches me the new protocols: conversation must begin with goodbyes and end with hellos; food is consumed starting with dessert; books are read from back to front; and most importantly, conformity to these new patterns is strictly enforced by the mysteriously emerged "Inversioners," figures in mirrored uniforms who patrol the streets.

As I struggle to adapt to this inverted reality—trying to walk backward without falling, speaking in reverse sentence structures, and wearing my clothes with seams showing—I discover a hidden community of "Forwards" meeting secretly in abandoned subway tunnels, plotting to restore the old order while practicing forbidden "traditional" behaviors.

The dream intensifies as I find myself torn between adapting to this bizarre new world and joining the resistance, all while experiencing the disorienting sensation that perhaps this inverted reality has always been the truth, and my memories of "normal" life are themselves the illusion.
