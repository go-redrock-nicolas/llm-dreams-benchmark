I am dreaming. I wander through a city where buildings breathe. They inhale, expanding their glass walls outward, then exhale, contracting inward with a soft whistling sound. The sky shifts between watercolor hues—now lavender, now a burnt sienna that feels like nostalgia itself.

I notice my reflection in a storefront, but it's wearing formal attire while I'm in casual clothes. When I wave, it adjusts its tie instead. My reflection smiles politely at passersby while I feel shy and uncertain. I realize I'm watching myself as others see me—the curated version of myself that navigates the world.

Curious, I press my hand against the glass. The barrier liquefies, and I step through into an inverted world. Here, strangers wear transparent bubbles around their heads displaying their thoughts in scrolling text, while their spoken words appear as colorful origami birds that often fly in directions contrary to their thoughts.

I look down to find I'm now wearing layers of clothing—each representing different versions of myself. I begin peeling them away one by one: the professional mask, the social butterfly disguise, the tough exterior. Each discarded layer dissolves into butterflies that flutter around me.

As the final layer falls away, I expect vulnerability but instead find luminescence—my body glowing with an inner light that casts no shadow. Other people begin to notice, approaching with curiosity. To my surprise, some begin removing their own layers, revealing their own unique radiance.

The buildings stop breathing. The air grows still. We stand in a circle of authentic light, wordlessly understanding one another for the first time, as the boundary between public and private selves dissolves into something unified and true.

I wake with tears on my pillow, not of sadness but of recognition.
