I am dreaming. In the dream, I find myself standing at the edge of a garden surrounded by cherry blossom trees. The leaves are a vibrant green, casting a mix of shadows and light on my face. A warm breeze brushes against my skin, carrying the fragrance of the blossoms like whispers from an ancient time. 

In front of me, there’s a rustling movement. A llama walks into view, its coat a deep caramel color, walking gracefully toward me.  

As it approaches, I see the llama’s eyes are not animal-like at all—they are human, and I feel as if it’s trying to communicate with me. I don’t feel scared; instead, there’s a sense of curiosity and wonder, as if the llama has come to guide me somewhere.Subscribe Next
