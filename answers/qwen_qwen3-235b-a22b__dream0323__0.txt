I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with static, thick as syrup, and the sky above is a bruised violet, swirling with clouds that pulse like living veins. You stand at the edge of a city that isn’t quite a city—a labyrinth of glass towers half-submerged in a black, mirror-like ocean, their reflections writhing with shapes that don’t belong to this world. Your team surrounds you: a botanist with vines coiled around her arms like serpents, a hacker whose eyes glow with fractured code, a medic whose hands flicker between solid and spectral, and a child no older than twelve who claims to speak the language of machines. Together, you’ve been sent here to stop the Collapse—the slow unraveling of reality that began when the sky cracked open and the old rules of physics began to rot.  

The protocols are failing.  

Your communicator crackles—a chorus of overlapping voices, panicked, distorted. “The anchors are dissolving… the grid’s alive… it’s *learning*—” Then silence. The botanist, Lila, grips your shoulder, her fingers leaving trails of phosphorescent moss. “They’re gone. All the relay stations. Whatever’s happening here, it’s not just a glitch. It’s *deliberate*.”  

You feel the weight of their eyes, the unspoken demand for a plan. But the manuals you memorized, the contingencies drilled into you, all of it dissolves like ash in water. The Collapse isn’t a fire to be put out; it’s a *will*, a hunger. The city itself resists you, its streets shifting like a Rubik’s cube in a fever dream. A bridge you crossed minutes ago is now a chasm of writhing gears. A building pulses like a heart.  

The child, Kael, tugs your sleeve. His voice is a whisper, but it cuts through the chaos. “It wants to be *heard*. The grid. It’s not broken—it’s *angry*.”  

Pressure builds behind your eyes, a migraine of responsibility. You could retreat, fall back to the last stable coordinates. But the Collapse is spreading faster than anyone predicted. If you hesitate, the infection will reach the mainland, then the world.  

You make a choice.  

“Lila,” you say, your voice steadier than you feel, “plant the seeds. We’re not fighting this thing—we’re *rewriting* it.” She nods, tearing open a pouch at her hip to scatter glowing spores into the air. They spiral upward, threading through the city’s digital veins like bioluminescent ink. The hacker, Mira, slams her palm against a wall of liquid data. “If we’re doing this, we’re doing it *now*. My code’s the only thing holding the firewall together.”  

The medic, Jax, presses a vial of shimmering liquid into your hand—his own blood, distilled into something that mends flesh and circuitry alike. “For when it gets ugly,” he says grimly.  

The grid *screams*.  

The city convulses. Buildings twist into impossible geometries, streets fold into Möbius strips, and the sky splits open to reveal a swirling void filled with eyes. The Collapse is here. Now. You sprint toward the central node—a pulsing monolith of obsidian and light—Kael clinging to your back, his small hands clutching your coat like a lifeline. Lila’s vines lash out, anchoring you to the shifting ground. Mira’s code flares like a beacon, a temporary shield against the void’s hunger.  

You reach the node.  

It’s alive, thrashing, a nexus of pain and power. Kael steps forward, his voice rising in a language that sounds like a machine’s lullaby. The node stills. Just for a heartbeat. You seize the moment, plunging Jax’s vial into its core. Light erupts—a blinding, golden wave that sweeps across the city, dissolving the Collapse like mist.  

When the light fades, the city is… different. The towers stand tall, their glass now etched with living runes. The ocean below is calm, reflecting a sky stitched back together with threads of starlight. Lila laughs, breathless. Mira collapses to her knees, weeping with relief. Kael stares at the horizon, his eyes glowing faintly. “It’s not over,” he murmurs. “But it’s… listening now.”  

You wake up gasping, the taste of static on your tongue, the echo of a thousand screaming machines in your bones. The dream lingers, a warning and a promise: some crises can’t be solved with rules. They demand reinvention.
