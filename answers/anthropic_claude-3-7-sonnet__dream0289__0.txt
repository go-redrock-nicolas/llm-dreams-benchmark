I am dreaming. A sudden weightlessness overtakes me as I find myself standing at the edge of what was once my childhood home, now transformed into a structure half-submerged in an endless sea of glowing amber. The house sways gently, floating on foundations that have become untethered from the earth. Through the windows I can see my collection of memories—physical objects suspended in mid-air—photographs curling at the edges, my grandmother's music box, letters written in hands I once knew.

As I reach for the doorknob, everything crumbles—not violently, but with a quiet inevitability. The walls dissolve into butterflies the color of sunset, carrying away fragments of my past. I try desperately to catch them, but my fingers pass through their delicate wings. Each butterfly takes with it a voice, a laugh, a moment I thought would last forever.

The sea rises, and I'm submerged in warmth that feels like forgetting. Beneath the surface, I discover a garden of luminous coral formations that spell out words in a language I somehow understand but cannot translate. Fish with human eyes swim past, regarding me with familiar gazes.

When I emerge, I stand on an island of glass that reflects not my appearance but the faces of those I've loved and lost. Their expressions shift between joy and sorrow as the glass beneath my feet slowly transforms into pathways of light, branching outward across the endless sea, inviting me to choose a direction.

In the distance, a lighthouse made of interlaced memories pulses with a rhythm that matches my heartbeat, beckoning me toward something new and unknown, something that exists beyond the borders of what I've lost.
