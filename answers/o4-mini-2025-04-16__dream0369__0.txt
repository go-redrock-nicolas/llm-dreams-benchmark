I am dreaming. You feel a sudden jolt as a heavy door slams somewhere behind you. Your pulse spikes, nostrils flaring at the sharp tang of ozone and molten metal in the air. For a heartbeat—longer than a heartbeat—you hover suspended between reaction and restraint. In that glimmering instant, the world dissolves.

The rusted corridor around you melts like wax. Walls curl upward into smoldering petals of copper and jade. The floor gives way beneath your feet, and you drift, weightless, through a cathedral of drifting lantern-ghosts. Each lantern is a flickering memory: a summer’s laugh, a half-forgotten lullaby, an echoing warning you once silenced. They pulse in time with your breath, soft drums resonating through your chest.

Time itself slows. You taste starlight on your tongue—icy, sweet, with just a hint of seawater—and feel a gentle wind coax your hair into spirals of living flame. You realize that this moment, this pregnant pause before you act, is a doorway. It beckons you forward on a path of light that coils through the dream’s innermost sanctum.

Ahead, a mirror floats on a pool of liquid silver. Its surface ripples as you approach, reflecting not your face but a cascade of shifting possibilities: fury turned to compassion, words sharpened into gentle truth, panic transformed into serene clarity. You reach out and touch the glass. It yields like water beneath your fingertips, and a warm glow spreads through your palm, seeping into your bones.

As the lantern-ghosts swirl faster, their light weaving constellations overhead, you feel a quiet smile blooming inside you. The anger that had flickered behind your eyes softens. Where once you saw threat, you now perceive invitation—to listen more deeply, to choose more kindly, to step with intention rather than charge on impulse.

Then the dream exhales. The corridor reforms around you, solid again but suffused with a gentle green luminescence. The door that slammed has reopened, revealing a sky of lavender dusk and iridescent birds gliding homeward. You stand at the threshold, no longer a puppet to your first reaction but the master of your own unfolding story.

In that luminous pause between stimulus and response, you have touched the essence of true freedom—and when you finally step forward, every choice you make carries the soft, boundless echo of this dream.
