I am dreaming. 

As I stand at the threshold of the void, the air hums with the electric charge of possibility. To my left, a familiar path unfurls—its cobblestones worn smooth by centuries of footsteps, flanked by willows that weep golden light. Their branches cradle fireflies like constellations caught in glass, each flicker whispering memories: the scent of childhood kitchens, laughter pooled in lamplit rooms, songs sung just below the breath. Safety thrums here, a lullaby knitted from all I’ve ever known.

But then, the scent shifts—burnt sugar giving way to ozone. To my right, a storm. Not of rain, but of *things unformed*. A bridge of spiraling obsidian arcs into a chasm where rivers flow upward, bronze waters defying gravity to crash against inverted cliffs. The wind carries voices—not in words, but in textures: the rasp of dragonfly wings, the creak of doors never opened, the resonant hum of stars dragged across primordial ice. 

I step toward the tempest. The ground beneath me liquefies, becomes a mirror reflecting not my face but *possibilities*—a thousand fractured selves rippling outward. One shard shows my hands wreathed in bioluminescent vines, another my shadow grown gargantuan, casting cities into twilight. My breath syncs with the pulse of the storm, each heartbeat peeling back layers of the known world like rinds from a fruit. 

The air vibrates with a question, not spoken but *grown*, tendrils of inquiry curling around my ribs: *What shape does your courage take when stripped of fear?* 

I leap.  

The fall is not a plummet but an unfurling. Bones become tree rings, hair unravels into comet trails. I am no longer falling *through* the storm but *as* the storm—spinning, consuming, birthing labyrinths of light. Unknown? No. This is the edge where every ending kneads itself into beginnings. The air tastes of forged metals and forgotten alphabets. And somewhere, deeper still, a note thrums—low, insistent—the sound a root makes when it finally cracks open bedrock.
