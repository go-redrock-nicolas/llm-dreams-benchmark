I am dreaming. In the dream, you stand on a shore where the ocean stretches into a horizon blurred by twilight. The water isn’t blue but a shifting kaleidoscope of obsidian and mercury, reflecting a sky choked with storm clouds that never quite break. The air smells like burnt sugar and salt, cloying and sharp.  

The person you care about is waist-deep in the surf, building a sandcastle with meticulous, feverish hands. Their fingers scrape raw against the grit, yet they pile the walls higher, using not sand but something darker—charcoal, maybe, or ash. The structure is ornate: spires jagged as shattered teeth, moats filled with liquid that glows faintly, like bioluminescent venom. You notice the foundations are sinking, the tide gnawing at the edges, but they don’t look up. Their laughter echoes, hollow and metallic, as they press sharp-edged shells into the walls like jewels.  

You try to call out, but your voice fragments into the wind, scattering as seafoam. When you reach for them, your legs root into the sand, tendrils of kelp coiling around your ankles. They glance your way briefly, eyes glinting like shards of wet glass. "It’s stronger this way," they say, scooping a fistful of black sand. "Can’t you see?"  

A wave crashes, and the castle’s tallest tower cracks. They scramble to rebuild it, fingers bleeding, but the structure grows more unstable—angles warping, walls bulging as if something thrums inside, alive and hungry. You plead silently, but the kelp tightens, pulling you deeper into the sand until it laps at your collarbone. Above, the clouds finally rupture, raining not water but tiny silver hooks that cling to skin and clothes.  

The dream fractures.  

In a blink, you’re standing in a mirrored version of the beach, everything inverted. The sandcastle is now a labyrinth of ice, refracting cold, prismatic light. The person sits at its center, tracing fissures in the walls with a bleeding fingertip. Their voice is a whisper threaded with static: "This is how it has to be." You try to shatter the ice with your fists, but each blow mends the cracks faster than you can make them.  

When you wake, the taste of ash lingers, and your palms itch with phantom grains of sand.
