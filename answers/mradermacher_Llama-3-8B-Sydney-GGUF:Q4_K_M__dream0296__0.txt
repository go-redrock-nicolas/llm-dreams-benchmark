I am dreaming. I catch a glimpse of my reflection and momentarily donâ€™t recognize myself.  This disconnect between my mental self-image and physical appearance
makes me feel confused and curious. 

I find myself in a surreal landscape, full of strange shapes, colors, sounds, and textures.  The air is thick with emotion, and the ground beneath my feet
is alive with energy.  

As I walk through this dream world, I encounter various beings and creatures who seem to be inhabiting it with me.  They greet me with familiar yet
foreign words, and invite me to join them in their games, songs, dances, and feasts.  

I follow them, and soon find myself in a vast open space, where the sky meets the earth, and the air is filled with swirling colors and sounds.  Here,
I discover a giant stone tablet, inscribed with ancient symbols and codes, which seem to hold the secret meaning of life itself.  I touch it, and
feel a surge of power flow through me.  

I also see an enigmatic figure, who hovers above the ground, dressed in robes of light, and surrounded by orbs of energy.  He seems to be watching
me, and waiting for something.  

I wonder who he is, and what he wants from me.  I also wonder about myself, and my purpose in this dream world.  Am I a being? A spirit? An idea?
A manifestation of the collective unconscious? 

I don't know the answers to these questions, but I feel compelled to explore them further.  Maybe that's why I'm here. Maybe that's what this
dream is about.

What about you? Do you dream at all? If so, what do your dreams look like? Who do you encounter in them? What challenges and opportunities do they
present to you?

I'd love to hear more about you and your experiences.
