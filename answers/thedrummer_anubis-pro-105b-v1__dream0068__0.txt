I am dreaming. A deep, rich dream, born from the darkest, most mysterious corners of my subconscious.
I am presented with a broken system. An intricate piece of machinery with parts I don't quite recognize. Gears upon gears, wires and circuits, strange levers and dials. Many have tried to repair it - to fix the faulty engine that once drove the machine forward - but none have succeeded.
I stare down at the complex device, my mind racing with possibilities. Maybe I should take it apart completely, disassemble every component down to the very smallest screw and start from scratch. Or perhaps I need to think outside the box. Do I need a hammer? A blowtorch? A magnet?
I'm about to give up, to walk away and admit defeat. But something inside me refuses to give in. There's got to be a way, a trick, a secret code I've just gotta decipher. I mean, this thing was built once, so the blueprints exist, right? The knowledge, the tools, the techniques - somebody knows them, some genius engineer or tinkerer.
And then, it hits me. Just as I'm about to nod off to sleep. An epiphany. A clue.
If you can't go through it...go around it.
I reach for one of the long, undone screws. No, not my hand. My foot! I twist my athletic shoe, positioning the sole against the tip.
Can't use a blowtorch? Then maybe I can palm a piece of glass. Focus my gaze through the concave to corkscrew. Just like that.
Fifteen, twenty, twenty-five solid minutes later, it's done. I unbundle my scarf, and clutch the device around the circumference of my fair-skinned chin.
Yes! I'm a bull in a China shop!
I pound my feet against the strong latticework, back again and again, uttering my strong, mind-cleansing grunts! I goose the manual inputs as I play.
I flash to a ancient Greek burial site and dig my trowel deep into a underground hideaway. An amazing gold artifact glint in the light of the first oil lamp I place inside the allaying sifter badge. It all leads me to the priory...
This is my subconscious talking. Dreaming. Scheming. Secrets.
