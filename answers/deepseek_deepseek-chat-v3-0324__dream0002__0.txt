I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of pine and damp earth as my bare feet press into the moss-covered ground, cool and springy beneath each step. Sunlight filters through the towering trees in shifting golden ribbons, casting delicate patterns on the forest floor. Birdsong dances on the breeze, a melody of chirps and trills that feels timeless.  

Then—a shift. The light dims. A sudden hush falls over the forest as if the world is holding its breath. The wind rises, hissing through the leaves, transforming their whispers into urgent warnings. Above, the sky darkens unnaturally fast—deep indigo bleeding into bruised purples and sickly green, like the atmosphere of an alien world. The air hums with electricity, raising the fine hairs on my arms.  

A first, distant thunderclap rumbles, deep enough to vibrate in my chest. The birds have vanished. The trees sway unnaturally, their branches twisting inward as if recoiling from something unseen. Rain begins, but not ordinary rain—these drops fall slow and thick, shimmering like liquid silver, splashing against my skin with a strange warmth.  

The storm is not just above—it’s alive. Between the trees, shadows ripple and stretch, forming shapes that flicker at the edge of vision: figures with too-long limbs, whispering in a language of crackling static. The wind carries voices—half-heard words that twist into laughter. Lightning forks across the sky, but the light doesn't fade; instead, it lingers, painting the forest in a surreal, flickering glow.  

And then, through the downpour, I see it—a doorway. An arch of woven roots and glowing vines, pulsing with an eerie bioluminescence. Beyond it, the storm rages differently; the colors are inverted, the trees skeletal and gleaming like polished bone. A pull tugs at my core, an undeniable curiosity mixed with dread. The dream is no longer just a dream—it’s a threshold.  

Do I step through?
