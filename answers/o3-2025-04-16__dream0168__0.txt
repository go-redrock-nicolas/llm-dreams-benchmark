I am dreaming. The dream unfurls in a single electric heartbeat.

You stand at the hub of a colossal glass-walled command sphere that floats several stories above a phantom city. Through the transparent floor, avenues flicker like capillaries lit by lightning: red tail-lights, blue strobes, and the steady molten orange of oncoming calamity. Your console is a luminous ring of holograms, each shimmering pane taller than you, each one screaming for attention in its own frantic dialect of blinking reds and arterial purples.

Disaster One: An earthquake has ripped a grin across Midtown, swallowing streetcars whole. Tilted office towers lean like trees uprooted by an unseen hand, showering the air with glass that glints like confetti in a cruel parade.

Disaster Two: To the south, a chemical plant’s storage vats have cracked their silver skins, exhaling clouds so neon they look like spilled auroras. Sirens that were meant to pierce the sky now croak through blown speakers, their dying cries swallowed by the hiss of escaping gas.

Disaster Three: Along the harbor, a hurricane’s advance guard—black, hammer-shaped thunderheads—barrels upriver, shoveling walls of water against the floodgates with merciless fists.

Your comms panel should be a symphony of voices; instead it’s a staccato graveyard of broken signals. Each channel opens as white noise, bursts into frantic syllables—“…fire crew… trapped… power grid—is down!… people on the roof!”—and then dissolves into the hungry hush of interference. Every failure is a hook in your chest.

Time in the dream folds and pleats like origami. Five seconds can hold an hour’s worth of choices; an hour can shrink to a breath. You train your focus on the earthquake sector first. With a swipe you re-route the city’s fleet of heavy-lift tiltrotors—beautiful, dragonfly-sleek machines—but halfway through the order the network collapses. The aircraft icons freeze, caught mid-air like insects in amber. Rage surges. You shove language aside and think in pure intention: MOVE. For an instant, impossibility bends; the icons crawl forward another millimeter. Dream physics honor willpower as much as circuitry.

A fresh screen snarls open behind you—an automated alert from the chemical zone. Pressure gauges hiss into the red; the plant is ten minutes from an unscripted fireworks display. You can smell the alkali tang of it, though you know you shouldn’t. Through a ruptured radio you pull in the gravelly voice of Captain Velez, half-masked by static: “Foam cannons are jammed… we’re improvising with seawater, but the pumps—” And then nothing. The silence swells until you can taste copper on your tongue.

You raid the city’s maintenance inventory in desperation, pairing obsolete snow-maker trucks from a defunct ski attraction with spare fire foam reservoirs. In the dream’s illogic the fittings marry perfectly, a puzzle that completes itself out of sheer need. You thrust the unlikely convoy toward the plant, tracking its progress like luminous arrows fired into darkness.

Meanwhile, the hurricane’s vanguard slams the harbor in slow-motion violence. Cargo cranes snap like matchsticks; shipping containers surf the surge and batter riverfront condos. The floodgate operator’s camera feed shakes, steadies, then blanks out as if the lens itself has blinked. Somewhere in that watery maze, an evacuation ferry loaded beyond capacity is losing engine power. You feel its collective heartbeat—hundreds of pulses, all fluttering in the same cage.

Comms fail yet again, but dancers of data still jitter at the edges of your vision: population density heatmaps, transit lines glowing like veins, sunburst clusters showing where power lines remain alive. You exhale and dive inward. The glass walls of the command sphere fade, replaced by an ocean of red and blue threads you can pluck like harp strings. Tug here—reroute surplus city buses onto high ground. Tug there—unlock the metro tunnels’ emergency flood doors a minute early, allowing trapped water to vent and buy crucial seconds for the ferry.

When your eyes reopen, the command sphere is trembling—literally vibrating on a gyroscopic spine as if the entire city’s anxiety were trying to shake it loose. From far below comes a newborn roar: the tiltrotors you freed by force of will slice through updrafts above the quake zone, hauling survivors in cargo nets. On a separate monitor, the improvised snow-maker convoy unleashes billows of foam the color of milk, smothering the chemical vats just as halo-ed fire tries to birth itself. The harbor surge recedes by inches, then feet, as floodgates groan into place, scattering sheets of spray that catch stray moonlight.

You find yourself smiling, not in triumph but in a fierce, exhausted gratitude. Within the dream, every saved life floods you with instantaneous warmth—a constellation of small, private suns lighting your ribcage.

But the dream is cruel in its generosity: it gives you one final test. Without warning, the city’s power grid surges and fails. Holograms fizzle into dusk; floor panels flicker; your breath fogs as the room’s temperature drops to the hush of winter. Darkness swallows all visual data, robbing you of strategy’s sight.

So you close your eyes and listen. Under the childlike hush of blackout you can hear wind ricocheting down empty corridors, hear the subsonic pulse of helicopter rotors, hear the faraway thunderclap of collapsing masonry. And threaded through that chaos you also hear the thin, defiant music of hope—individual voices raised in ragged applause, the clang of rescued civilians banging tools against debris to announce, “Alive, alive!”

You do not need screens for that. You simply stand, spine straight, and breathe the chorus in. The dream bows around you like a dark theater after the final cue. Somewhere, sirens taper into silence; somewhere, floodwater loosens its grip on asphalt; somewhere, a buried phone finally rings clear.

When you answer, the only words you manage are: “Hold fast—we’re still here.” And across the fractured city, the reply rises like sunrise pointed inward: “Copy that. Still here, too.”

The command sphere sighs, and dawn—soft, improbable—stains the horizon gold. The dream dissolves, leaving the taste of ozone and victory on your tongue, and the heartbeat of millions gently slowing in your chest.
