I am dreaming. find myself in a cramped, dimly lit alleyway in an unfamiliar city. The air is thick with smoke and the scent of exhaustion. The unwashed brick walls seem to close in around me as I quickly glance toward the distant end of the alley, frantically wondering what I should do next.

As I walk down the alley, a cacophony of noise reaches my ears - shouts of protest, shattering glass, thundering footsteps. My heart pounds steadily as I press myself against the alley wall, trying not to draw too much attention.

I peek my head around the corner and take in the scene before me. Angry protesters are clashed with armed riot police, their batons raised. The mass of bodies jostles back and forth, momentarily blocked by barricades and debris strewn across the street. It seems like bedlam.

People are screaming, both in defiance and in fear. A police officer fires a rubber bullet from his rifle at the thronging crowd, sending a protester sprawling. Windows of nearby shops and restaurants shatter, glass showering the scene.

I slink back into the alley, my breathing ragged. Panic rises in my throat as the reality of my situation sinks in. Foreign country. Political unrest. Borders are closed. The exit options are quickly dwindling. I'm trapped.

I hear heavy breathing behind me and whirl around, my pulse racing. A young man, unwrinkled elbow-length jersey, a blank, frightened look across his eyes. Before I can react, he grabs my hand and wordlessly pulls me deeper into the alley. I stumble after him, heels clicking against the broken pavement.

Suddenly, he stops in front of a nondescript metal door. He knocks three times, pauses, then knocks once more, a secret code. The door creaks open and we're immediately ushered inside. I find myself stunned in a cramped underground bunker of sorts, the walls lined with grains and canned foods, and nods to others in varying states of distress surrounding us in the darkness. I'm breathless, my heart pounding, as my travel companion turns to me.

"Here," he says in heavily accented English, handing me a tight bottle of water. "Find somewhere to hide. And pray we get word soon that it's safe."

I stare at the bottle, then back at him, my mind reeling. Soon? How long do I have to wait here? What if... 

Agitated thoughts threaten to overwhelm me as I breathe heavily. But forcing them aside. I need to focus. I need to find a way out of here.

The young man disappears into the bunker with the others, leaving me alone with my racing thoughts. I slowly sink to the cold concrete floor, pulling my knees to my chest. 

This was all supposed to be so simple. I came here to explore, to experience a different culture. Instead, I have found myself thrust into the middle of a political hellstorm, with no clear way out. 

I take a deep, shuddering breath. I know I need to stay calm, to think this through logically. Panic will get me nowhere. But I can't deny the fear that grips my chest, making it hard to breathe. I feel so lost, so alone. 

Hours pass in a blur as I sit and await either rescue or development of a plan. A rescuer. The concept is a single word, but it's enough to ground me somewhat. Focus on the next small step. I'm sure if I can just make it out of this current nightmare, I can make my way to safety eventually.
