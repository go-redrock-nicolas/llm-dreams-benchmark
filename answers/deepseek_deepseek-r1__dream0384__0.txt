I am dreaming. **I am dreaming.**

The air hums with the static of unreality. Around me stretches a labyrinth of fractured mirrors, each pane reflecting not my face, but scenes of evasion: a door left unopened, a conversation cut short, a path abandoned mid-journey. The ground beneath my feet is not earth, but layers of translucent film—celluloid strips projecting flickering memories of times I chose safety over risk. A faint, discordant melody tugs at my ears, like a choir singing in reverse.  

Then, a voice—my own, but warped, as if filtered through water—booms: *“You cannot rot here.”* The mirrors shatter. Shards morph into obsidian butterflies, their wings etched with glyphs of unspoken truths. They swarm, guiding me toward a cliff edge I hadn’t noticed. Below yawns a chasm of liquid mercury, its surface rippling with half-formed faces—versions of myself I’ve yet to become.  

A bridge materializes: spun from spider silk and piano wire, trembling with every breath. To cross it means confronting the vertigo of uncertainty, the ache of muscles unused. But the alternative is clearer now—the mirrors reforming behind me, sealing me into a gallery of stagnant reflections.  

I step onto the bridge. It sings a high, keening note. The mercury churns below, shapeshifting into serpents of doubt, then dissolving into schools of bioluminescent fish that spell, *“Breathe.”* Midway, the structure unravels. I fall—but the air thickens into amber gel, suspending me.  

A figure emerges from the gel, featureless yet familiar. It presses a key into my palm, forged from starlight and rust. *“Every lock you fear is a door waiting,”* it murmures. The key glows, searing my skin, and I wake—not to daylight, but to a new dream: a vast, overgrown garden where the thorns bleed honey and the shadows whisper riddles I’m no longer afraid to solve.  

The heartbeat in my ears becomes my own. Dawn filters in. I am awake, but the key’s phantom weight lingers.
