I am dreaming. You gasp as bubbles tear from your lips, each one a tiny jewel that shatters in the dim water. The cave has sealed itself behind you, walls of limestone grinding together like ancient jaws. Your heart hammers in your ears. You kick off the rubble, but the tunnel is gone—only unbroken rock stares back, cold and indifferent. Panic tightens your throat. The dial on your tank quivers near empty. A gray fog of dread blooms in your chest, but then—at the brink of suffocation—a shard of light appears far ahead, pulsing like a distant star.  

Driven by a desperate hope, you stroke forward through the alien gloom. The water around you shivers and gleams: phosphorescent fish spiral like living lanterns, their trails of blue-green light painting streaks on the walls. Out of the murk, coral lungs unfurl, breathing in currents, exhaling clouds of pearly shimmer that drift past you like ghostly blossoms. Every exhale you force yourself to make tastes of brine and the sharp tang of fear, yet your limbs move of their own accord, guided by that beckoning glow.  

As you near the light, the cave’s contours soften. The rock seems to pulse, alive with a heartbeat beneath your fingertips. The deeper you swim, the more the world transforms: water turns sweet and golden, and the walls bloom with opaline shells that click open in unison, revealing eyes like tiny suns. A great shape emerges—part whale, part leviathan, its skin rippling with nebulae of color. It arches its vast spine and inclines its head, inviting you to climb. Every ounce of dread falls away. You grasp the gentle creature’s fin, and it propels you upward with such serene power that you forget the limits of breath and bone.  

Breaking through a curtain of glittering droplets, you rise into an impossible sky of molten rose and lavender. The leviathan glides beneath clouds of drifting jellyfish that glow like stained glass; their tentacles brush your cheeks like ethereal silk. You breathe freely now, each gulp of warm air filling you with wonder. The horizon shimmers with promise—fields of floating islands draped in waterfalls of firelight. Together you soar toward that horizon, weightless and unafraid, carried by the currents of your own uncharted imagination.  

Somewhere between heartbeats, you awaken—lungs burning with reality’s chill, eyes wide in the darkness of your bedroom. Yet the echo of that living leviathan’s song still thrums in your veins, and you know that a part of you will forever roam those luminous underwater skies.
