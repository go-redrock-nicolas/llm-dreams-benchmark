I am dreaming. The sensation of floating in a realm where the boundaries of reality are but a distant memory. The air is alive with an ethereal glow, infusing my very being with an otherworldly essence. As I wander through this dreamscapes, I find myself amidst a gathering of souls, each embodying traits that I have gradually come to recognize within others – aspects I've long tried to conceal, deny, or sometimes even judge.

There's Sophia, her fiery spirit blazing like a phoenix, radiating an unbridled passion that sparks awe and intimidation in equal measure. Her antics dance across the landscape, an eccentric blend of spontaneity and unpredictability that I fear others might find unwelcome because it echoes my own rebellious streak – the part of me that yearns for breaks from the continuity of structure and stability.

Next to her stands Jasper, a quiet soul with eyes that hold the depth of the universe. His introspection whispers secrets of the soul, sharing wisdom that others might find as perplexing as they are drawn to the mystery. His introspective nature makes me wary because it echoes the stillness within me – a silence I often crave but sometimes misunderstand as laziness or lack of engagement, a nuanced facet of my own complexity.

The crowd thickens, an orchestra of selves I've tried to distance myself from. There's Felix, playful with words, armed with a sarcasm that veers between charming and biting. His wit and linguistic agility casts shadows of my own quick wit, a voice within me that refuses to speak but speaks loudly in mynish mannerisms – sharp, anxious, sometimes cutting. 

And then there's Ruby, fiercely independent but affectionate, her vulnerability not as hidden as she thinks it is. Her cry for freedom resonates within me – a yearning for unmasked authenticity, for shedding societal skins to uncover the honest, raw essence that too often stays buried beneath calming smiles and repression.

The ensemble shifts, a Gorgeous Reflection wave of faces – souls walking paths that feel eeroded compassionably mine — promenade before me, sometimes awkwardly in great virtgio. Gravity is softer here; all actions receive mirrored respect, making each gesture seem both illuminated and authenticate. The more I confront, consolidate and learn from these radiant pieces of myself trapped within the web of judgment falls away. Surrounding energy holds calm, summer distances.
