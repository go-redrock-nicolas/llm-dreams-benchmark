I am dreaming. …find yourself standing in a city square that glows with an otherworldly twilight—the sky a deep indigo river streaked with floating lanterns, each lantern displaying, like tiny movie screens, looping clips of your most practiced public smiles. A breeze sweeps across the marble ground and scatters paper masks in every direction. They skitter like autumn leaves, and each mask bears a different version of your face: the professional composure, the polite agreeableness, the effortless humor, the stoic calm.

Instinctively, you reach for one of the masks, but it dissolves into silver dust the moment your fingers graze it. The dust swirls into a narrow alleyway, drawing you forward. As you step from the grand square into the alley, cobblestones beneath your feet transform into translucent glass. Through the glass you glimpse a shadow-puppet theater below—private memories reenacted by silhouettes, things you never voice aloud. They dance soundlessly, yet emotion radiates upward in shimmering waves: tender, anxious, incandescently joyful.

Ahead, the alley opens into a mirrored ballroom, ceiling lost in darkness. Dozens of towering mirrors line the walls—some pristine, others cracked like spiderwebs. Star-bright chandeliers hang upside-down beneath your feet, as though gravity has politely excused itself. You walk past the mirrors, and each panel shows a different you, caught in some moment of public performance: delivering a speech, laughing too loudly at a joke, nodding along even when you disagree. But when you move closer, the reflections shudder, skin turning translucent, revealing clockwork gears and glowing wires where your heart should be—mechanisms that keep the public façade ticking.

A distant music box melody beckons from the far end, so you follow it until you reach a single curtain of velvet midnight. You draw it aside and enter a moonlit garden where the air smells of rain on warm stone and jasmine after dark. Here there are no mirrors, no masks—only a small pond so still it resembles polished obsidian. Kneeling, you peer into the water expecting another reflection, but you see nothing at all. The surface is blank, waiting.

You let out a breath you hadn’t realized you’d been holding, and in that exhalation something shifts: the learned postures fall from your shoulders like discarded cloaks. Words you’ve swallowed for politeness drift up through your throat, forming luminescent fireflies that rise into the night. Emotions you’ve hidden bloom on your skin like phosphorescent vines, illuminating every subtle contour of honesty you denied yourself in daylight. The garden listens, accepting each raw confession without judgment.

From the pond’s depths, a shape emerges—your face, but softer, unvarnished, eyes shining with untamed curiosity. This version of you reaches up through the water’s surface, hand extended. When your fingertips meet, a gentle shock ripples outward, dissolving the entire dreamscape into stardust until only the two of you remain in a boundless, velvety void.

You merge, not by vanishing into one another, but by layering—public and private selves overlapping like transparencies until they are no longer separable. The masks and mirrors fade, leaving a single heartbeat echoing in vast darkness. It is steady, unwavering, and unmistakably yours.

And then, in the silence, you wake—still feeling the cool press of that pond’s water, still hearing the quiet cadence of your freed breath. The morning light arrives like a promise: an invitation to narrow the gap between the person who moves through crowded streets and the one who whispers secrets to the stars.
