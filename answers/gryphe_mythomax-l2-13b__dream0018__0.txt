I am dreaming. As I walk through my familiar home, I notice something odd. The walls seem to be shifting, bulging in places where there were once straight lines. My heart skips a beat as I realize that the foundations of my house have been weakened, perhaps by an earthquake or other natural disaster.

Panic begins to set in as I explore further. The staircase looks unsteady, threatening to crumble under my feet. The ceilings are bowing down, coated in a layer of dust and debris, proving the damage runs deep.

Terrified for my family's safety, I make the difficult decision to evacuate. I gather my loved ones around me, our eyes full of fear and confusion as we try to comprehend what has happened to our home.

As we step outside, the gravity of the situation hits us. Our neighborhood is in a similar state, homes reduced to rubble or leaning precariously on one another. The air is thick with the smell of ash and the sound of sirens, indicating that there are more affected areas nearby.

Despite the apocalyptic environment, we must find shelter for the night. We hike through treacherous terrain, navigating through destroyed streets and avoiding debris falling from collapsed buildings. Finally, we stumble upon an abandoned warehouse that might offer some protection.

The warehouse is cold and damp, but it's safe enough. We huddle together for warmth as we assess our situation. There's no denying that our lives have been turned upside down in an instant. But somehow, through the chaos, we still have each other. As we drift off to sleep on the hard concrete floor, I pray that tomorrow brings better news about our broken home.
