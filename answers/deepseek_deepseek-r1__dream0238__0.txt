I am dreaming. **The Dream**

---

The air is electric with the copper tang of panic. Above, a fractured sky yawns open, veins of violet lightning splicing through clouds that swirl like oil on water. Below, the city sprawls in jagged ribbons—a labyrinth of glass spires and crumpled bridges, humming with the drone of malfunctioning drones. You stand atop a shuddering observation deck, a holographic map flickering in your palms. The protocols scroll in crimson text: *Evacuate Sector 9. Activate Gridlock Override. Deploy SkyFerries.* But the words stutter and decay, pixelating into gibberish. The system is eating itself.

**The Problem**  
The evacuation routes are flooding with people, but the SkyFerries—enormous levitating barges meant to glide above the chaos—are stuck in a recursive loop, docked at terminals that no longer exist. The crisis AI, *HYGGE-7*, insists on rerouting crowds through "Safe Zone Delta," a plaza now submerged under a lake of molten neon from a shattered power core. Protocols demand order, but order is the enemy here. You feel it in your bones: the rules are alive, *malicious*, folding reality into paradox.

**The Shift**  
A child’s balloon drifts past—hot pink, deflating—and brushes your wrist. Suddenly, the world *pulses*. You see through the grid: the city is a living circuit board, its streets synaptic pathways firing in panic. The true evacuation route isn’t mapped in the system—it’s in the gaps, the forgotten places. An abandoned subway tunnel humming with bioluminescent fungi. A rooftop garden where the wind unscrambles into a melody. To save them, you must unthink the plans.

**The Action**  
You tear the hologram in half. The city *shrieks*. Drones spiral like angry wasps as you sprint down a staircase that twists into a spiral slide, dumping you into the underground. The tunnel glows faintly blue, mycelial tendrils lighting the way. Behind you, the crowd begins to flow, not run—a river finding its delta. At the terminus, a barge awaits, but it’s not a SkyFerry. It’s a patchwork raft woven from subway cars and solar sails, piloted by a figure in a moth-eaten lab coat who grins, “Took you long enough.” 

---

**The Escape**  
As the city folds inward, collapsing into a blackhole prism of its own logic, the raft surges into a sky now streaked with auroras. Below, the protocols dissolve into static. You wake just as the child’s balloon pops—the sound echoing into a silver bell. The dream lingers like the taste of burnt honey. You’re certain, somehow, they made it.
