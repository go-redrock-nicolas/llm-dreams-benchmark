I am dreaming. **You are dreaming.**  

The world around you is drenched in an eerie twilight—a sunset that never quite ends, staining the sky in molten gold and bruised violet. The air hums with static, alive with unseen currents, and the ground beneath your feet is soft, shifting slightly as if breathing.  

You stand at the edge of a vast, obsidian-black lake, its surface so still it mirrors the sky perfectly, creating an abyss where heaven and hell blur together. Something waits for you in the depths—or perhaps on the other side—but the mere thought of stepping forward sends a bolt of white-hot dread through your chest.  

Your pulse quickens, a frantic drumbeat in your throat, and your body tenses, screaming at you to turn away, to flee. The instinct is primal, visceral—your ancient brain hissing, *"Danger, retreat, survive."*  

But then, you *notice.* You notice the way your hands tremble. Notice how your breath comes in shallow gasps. Notice how every part of you is coiled tight like a spring, ready to sprint into the dream’s shadowy hinterlands just to escape this moment.  

And in that flicker of awareness, the world *shifts.*  

The lake ripples. The sky shudders. And from the silence emerges a whisper, not from outside but *within*—a voice both foreign and familiar, saying, *"You’ve fled this before. But here, now, you can stay."*  

Your feet stay rooted to the ground.  

The mirrored water trembles as something stirs beneath—not a monster, not a specter, but a shape *taking form* in the reflection. Your own face stares back, but changed—older, wiser, eyes alight with something like sorrow, like knowing.  

And then you wake.  

But the lake remains.  

And next time, you go deeper.
