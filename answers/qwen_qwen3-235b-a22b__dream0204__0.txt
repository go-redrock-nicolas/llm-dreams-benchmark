I am dreaming. You drift into sleep, and the world dissolves into a velvet void—until a single note pierces the darkness. It rings like a silver bell, and suddenly, your tongue tingles with the sharp, effervescent sweetness of a lemon drop. You blink, and the sound blooms into a cascade of prismatic sparks, each hue humming its own melody. This is where reality bends: you’ve slipped into a dream where senses collide, fuse, and reinvent one another in ways no waking mind could fathom.  

You breathe in, and the air tastes of violins—woody, resonant, with a hint of rosin’s bitterness. A distant rumble of thunder rolls across the sky (which isn’t a sky at all, but a swirling tapestry of molten gold and indigo), and your teeth prickle with the earthy umami of a cello’s lowest register. You laugh, and the sound erupts as a shower of cerulean petals, each one emitting a soft, fluting trill as it falls. The petals dissolve on your skin, leaving trails of warmth that smell like forgotten lullabies.  

You begin to wander this kaleidoscopic realm, your footsteps silent but *felt*—each step resonating as a chord in your ribs. A forest materializes, trees with bark like shattered mirrors reflecting not light, but sound: shimmering arpeggios, staccato giggles of birdsong, the bass-line growl of roots tunneling through subterranean silence. You touch a leaf, and it tastes of peppermint and high-pitched violin squeals. The trunk pulses under your palm, emitting a low, chocolate-rich vibration that coats your throat like molten caramel.  

Ahead, a river flows not with water, but with liquid violins—strings undulating in currents, bowing against one another to create a symphony of rushing, honeyed tones. You dip your hand in, and the music floods your mouth: briny, smoky, with a finish of citrus and longing. You drink, and your vision sharpens into hypercolor—every shade now has a timbre, every sound a texture. A scarlet ribbon snakes through the air, singing a tango of cinnamon and regret. A shadow passes overhead, cobalt and silent, like a held breath.  

You find yourself in a studio, though the walls are alive—canvas, clay, and chimes fused into a single medium. You grab a brush dipped in thunderstorm-gray paint and drag it across the air. Where the stroke lands, a chord erupts: a cello’s moan layered with the crunch of autumn leaves. You sculpt a figure from hummingbird whispers and bassoon vibrations, its form shifting with each note you hum. The sculpture answers back, singing in hues of jade and plum, its voice a tactile vibration that massages your cheekbones.  

Then, the crescendo: you dance. Each movement births a synesthetic storm. Your fingertips trace arcs of saffron static, which detonate into jazz riffs. Your heartbeat becomes a drumline, felt in the soles of your feet as much as heard—a drumskin of garnet thudding in 7/8 time. You spin, and the room fills with a fugue of flavors: trumpet blasts of pineapple, tuba rumbles of blackberry jam, a harp’s aftertaste of glacier water. The walls weep liquid sonata, pooling at your ankles as a tide of edible harmonics.  

In this dream, you’re no longer a person but a conduit—a synapse where art is born from the friction of senses. You paint with symphonies, compose with spices, carve marble that weeps lullabies. Time unravels; the studio fractures into fractal vignettes, each a portal to another sensory alchemy. You glimpse a desert where dunes sing in sandpaper tones and taste of sunbaked regret. A city floats upside-down, its skyscrapers chiming like carillon bells, their windowsills blooming with roses that smell like Beethoven.  

And then—a whisper. A hand brushes yours, and the dream shudders. The synesthesia begins to fray at the edges, the crosswired senses retreating like a tide. You wake tangled in sheets, pulse racing, the ghost of a cello’s aftertaste lingering on your tongue. For a heartbeat, the world still hums with color… until it fades, leaving only the ache of a vision just beyond grasp, and the urgent, trembling need to create.
