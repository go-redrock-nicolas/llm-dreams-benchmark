I am dreaming. …find yourself in a circle of mismatched chairs, huddled around a single overhead light that flickers softly like a dying firefly. The room around you feels cavernous and yet close—rough concrete walls stretch upward into a twilight canopy, as if you are inside some gigantic cathedral built from cement. Nervous laughter echoes intermittently through the air, and the faint sound of dripping water from an unseen source punctuates the hush. You catch sight of a few incongruous details: an ornate, centuries-old grandfather clock leaning against a far wall, its steady ticking echoing like a heartbeat; a half-finished mural splashed across the concrete behind it, featuring glowing silhouettes dancing like ghost-lanterns in swirling neon paint.

Your seat is an old wooden folding chair, squeaking under the slightest shift of your body. The circle’s arrangement feels peculiarly tight, like a confessional gathering where each participant’s face is lit theatrically. Everyone stares at each other with a sort of anxious expectation. Some members are total strangers cloaked in shadow, while others have faces you almost recognize—perhaps from a distant childhood memory or fleeting run-in at a grocery store. Their gazes seem to pry, curious and benign, yet the pressure is immense, radiating in waves that rattle your composure.

A lead facilitator—a tall figure with a gauzy scarf that seems to shimmer with razzle-dazzle whenever they move—calmly addresses you by first name. The sound of your name in this echoing chamber makes your pulse quicken. You become acutely aware of your breathing, the rise and fall of your chest. A spidery chill creeps along your spine as the facilitator invites you to share something deeply personal. The hush that follows feels as if the air itself has been sucked from the room, leaving only the crackling anticipation of unspoken secrets.

You take in the circle again, each face a canvas of expectation. You notice the small details: a faint scar tracing the eyebrow of the person to your right, the chipped-tooth smile of the person to your left, and beyond them, someone’s trembling hands clutching the rusted arm of their chair. Even the overhead light seems to pulse to the rhythm of your heartbeat, and just when you think you might speak, it buzzes and dims, making your reflection in their eyes vanish momentarily.

Strangely, your mind drifts to a memory of a distant coastline in your childhood—perhaps it’s a clue to what you might share. You recall the tide swirling in gentle eddies around your ankles, foam hissing around everything it touched. A part of you longs to express this memory with all its delicate serenity and the childlike wonder it invokes. But revealing your secret longing for that lost sense of safety, that gentle hush of the ocean, feels mortifyingly intimate here, in the face of so many strangers. Your voice remains locked in your throat.

In the dreamlike logic of this moment, the chairs in the circle suddenly shift: they inch forward, bridging the gap until each seat is almost pushing against the next. You feel cornered, pressured by the unstoppable approach of faces, expectant eyes glowing in the dim. Each second you delay adds a new swirl of tension, as if the ceiling might crack open and rain down cold shards if you remain silent too long.

A bead of sweat rolls down your temple. The dripping sound from the walls seems louder, echoing inside your ribcage. Taking a shaky breath, you let your gaze sweep across the group, meeting as many eyes as you dare. You decide that if you are going to speak, you must speak honestly.

In a wavering voice, you concede a piece of yourself. Your words—fragile, quivering—fill the circle. You mention that vulnerability has always frightened you, that baring personal truths feels like shedding armor. Strangely, the sensation of voicing these thoughts in this surreal gathering is not entirely suffocating; it’s a small relief, like opening a dusty window in a stagnant attic. You notice subtle nods from others: the chipped-tooth smile softens, the individual with trembling hands relaxes their grip. Even though you can feel your cheeks burn and your heart pound like a storm, there is a subtle, almost imperceptible shift in the room’s energy.

You sense that this circle, which once felt like an interrogation, might actually be a space for shared understanding, if only the flickering light would hold steady, if only you could cling to your courage a little longer. The tension recedes like the tide, leaving behind the hush of possibility. A dreamlike calm descends, washing over the gathered faces as time seems to slow, elongating each breath, each heartbeat.

In that fleeting, luminescent moment—still perched on your squeaky chair, still trembling from the weight of your admission—you realize you’re not alone. The hush of potential acceptance hovers in the air, warm as an ember on a cold night. Voices all around you, quietly at first, begin to share their own guarded truths. The group becomes a chorus of hearts tentatively opening, stories swirling and twining together like strands of seaweed in an underwater breeze.

Even as your dream self hovers on the knife’s edge of panic and relief, a sense of wonder creeps in—the kind of wonder that comes from knowing you’ve gifted the circle with a piece of yourself, no matter how raw. Layers of uncertainty dissolve, and your consciousness begins to drift. Somewhere, in that vast, cathedral-like dreamscape, the clock continues its steady ticking—measuring the tempo of vulnerability and courage. The drip of unseen water provides a metronome for the moment’s tension. And in those dream-laden shadows, you discover a strange solace: the realization that you can gather your honesty, share a bit of your hidden self, and still find your way through the swirling currents of social pressure to a place that feels almost like belonging.
