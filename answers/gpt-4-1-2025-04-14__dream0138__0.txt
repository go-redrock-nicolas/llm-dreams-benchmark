I am dreaming.

I am standing atop the skeletal remains of a once-bustling highway bridge, its asphalt now split open like the shell of some colossal beast. The sky above roils with angry charcoal clouds, pulsing with the flicker of distant lightning and the growl of approaching thunder. Beneath me, the river has swollen into a churning, murky serpent, devouring buildings and trees as it roars through the drowned cityscape below.

A radio hisses and squawks in my grip—its speaker almost lost beneath the howl of the winds and the wails of sirens. I am the coordinator of a desperate rescue mission, my heart pounding with the weight of a thousand lives. To my left, a convoy of battered emergency vehicles struggles through knee-deep water, headlights cutting cones of hope through the gloom. To my right, the silhouette of an evacuation helicopter hovers wobbly in the storm, its battered rotors fighting invisible hands that try to pull it down.

Everywhere there are voices—pleas, demands, updates—filling my ears until I feel my mind spinning. In an abandoned apartment block, families cling to the upper floors, waving flashlights and towels for attention. Across town, the hospital generator has sputtered out; a surgeon relays harried messages, begging for fuel before critical patients slip away. Children are missing; an elderly couple is trapped by fallen debris; the levee may not last another hour.

With every passing moment, the disaster mutates and deepens. Resources shrivel like leaves in a bonfire—gasoline nearly gone, radio batteries dead, crews soaked and shivering, courage wearing threadbare as exhaustion seeps in. I am forced to choose: Do I send the only working boat to rescue those trapped on the school rooftop, or to ferry the injured from the makeshift clinic on the submerged market square?

My breath clouds in the carnivorous air. Decisions slice at my conscience, each one a trade-off between hope and anguish. I see the faces of my crew—eyes hollow with fatigue, yet burning with stubborn hope. Together, we leap from the bridge, sloshing into the black water. Every rescue is a victory wrested from the jaws of relentless chaos, every lost moment a drop in an ocean of regret.

Yet, somehow, amid the ruins, I feel that familiar ember of resolve. The end is not written. Even as the floodwaters rise and the night deepens, we will not give in. My voice crackles over the radio, a command born from desperation and compassion, as my team and I surge onward—undaunted, united, dreaming of the dawn.
