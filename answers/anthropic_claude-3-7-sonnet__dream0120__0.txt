I am dreaming. I find myself wading through corridors of alabaster and gold, my fingers trailing along walls inscribed with pictographs I almost understand. The air smells of frankincense and something unidentifiable—perhaps the scent of antiquity itself. My body is draped in layers of indigo silk, heavy jewelry clinking against my collarbone as I move toward the central chamber where the Council of Twelve awaits.

I am a diplomat from a distant land, sent to forge alliances with this civilization that predates recorded history—a society that operates on honor codes so intricate they resemble mathematics more than social customs. The high priestess explained the basics to me yesterday: never show the palms of your hands to nobility, speak in descending tones when addressing the elderly, and always, always consume the ceremonial nectar with your left hand while holding a moonstone in your right.

The grand chamber opens before me, a cathedral-like space where light filters through crystal ceiling panels, creating rainbow patterns across the assembled dignitaries. Their faces are serene but watchful, eyes that have witnessed centuries scrutinizing my every movement. The Council members sit upon curved chairs of some material that seems to shift between wood and metal depending on how the light strikes it.

I advance confidently, remembering my training. The ceremonial greeting begins smoothly—until I notice a small child approaching from my peripheral vision. The child carries a platter with what appears to be the sacred offering. Instinctively, I smile at the young one.

The chamber falls silent.

Horror dawns across every face before me. The High Elder's eyes widen in disbelief. I've done something unspeakable, though I cannot fathom what. Looking at a child during the Ceremony of Ascension? Showing teeth to an offering-bearer? The temperature in the room seems to drop twenty degrees.

"The outsider has invoked the Curse of Visibility," someone whispers, and the words echo through the chamber like broken glass. Guards with faces painted half-white, half-black materialize from alcoves I hadn't noticed. The Council members rise in unison, their elaborate headdresses scraping the ceiling.

My translator has vanished. My heart pounds. The society whose trust I've spent months cultivating now looks at me as if I've defiled their most sacred beliefs. And perhaps I have, through a simple, reflexive smile.

As they advance toward me, I frantically search my memory for some ritual of apology, some gesture of contrition, but the weight of ten thousand years of tradition stands against my ignorance, and I realize I am truly, utterly alone in this world where a single wrong movement might cost not just my mission, but my life...
