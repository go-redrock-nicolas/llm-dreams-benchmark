I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Unwanted Throne**  

I am dreaming.  

The air hums with whispers, thick like honey, curling around me in ribbons of muted gold. I stand in a vast hall with walls made of shifting mirrors—no, not mirrors, but countless faces, watching, waiting, deferring. They bow as I pass, though my footsteps make no sound. The floor is liquid silver, rippling with each hesitant move I make.  

A voice, though no mouth moves to shape it, drifts through the hall: *"Decide for us."*  

I do not feel wise. I do not feel certain. Yet they part before me, these faceless figures robed in twilight, their postures bent in reverence. A child offers me a crown woven from thorned roses, its petals gleaming like wet rubies. I do not reach for it—yet it hovers above my head, unsupported, its weight already pressing against my scalp.  

Before me, the hall splits into infinite corridors, each pulsing with a different hue, a different future. One glows amber, warm with laughter; another drips with indigo storm clouds. A third is colorless, endless, swallowing all light. The crowd waits.  

*"Choose,"* they murmur, though they do not speak.  

My chest is hollow with fear. Who made me arbiter of these fates? I turn to the nearest figure, grasping at their sleeve—but their form dissolves into moths, scattering into the mirrored dark. The crown's thorns dig deeper.  

Then, beneath it all, I hear another voice—my own, or something older, something buried.  

*"Refuse."*  

I reach up, fingers grazing the cold petals, and the dream shatters like glass.
