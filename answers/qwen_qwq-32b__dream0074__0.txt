I am dreaming. I'm suddenly in a strange world with floating islands of different colors. The sky is a swirling tapestry of galaxies. I see beings that look like humanoids but with wings made of stardust. They’re smiling and approach me. It’s quiet except for the sound of wind chimes and a faint hum. The ground beneath my feet is like walking on clouds. I feel both scared and excited. I don’t know how to communicate yet. One of the beings gestures, and a glowing orb appears in my hand. It pulses with energy. What does this mean? I need to figure out how to use it or what it represents. Maybe it’s a guide? Or a tool? The orb starts to float, leading me somewhere. I follow, curiosity overcoming fear. The path is lit by bioluminescent flowers. There’s a structure ahead, like a tower made of crystal. I can see my reflection in its facets.
