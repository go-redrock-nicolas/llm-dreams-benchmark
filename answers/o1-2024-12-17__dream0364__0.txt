I am dreaming. …notice the slender crack in the plastered wall beside you. At first, it is nothing more than a hairline fracture—an inconsequential blemish no different from the countless others you have passed by without a second glance. But in this dream, the crack glimmers with an otherworldly shimmer, as if galaxies swirl just beneath its surface. You move closer, breath catching in your throat, and peer into this fragile split where the texture of your reality is quietly unraveling. 

The plaster begins to crumble, revealing a hidden pocket behind it. At the same time, a soft, golden light spills from the crack and paints your skin in radiant streaks. You brush away a flake of paint, revealing a tiny hallway that couldn’t possibly exist in the waking world. Stepping through, you feel neither fear nor hesitation; the dream’s logic urges you forward to discover a realm normally hidden behind the mundane. 

Inside, you find yourself in a corridor of childhood sidewalk chalk drawings come to life—every color swirling around you is impossibly bright, like prismatic confetti dancing on a beam of sunlight. As you walk, you hear faint humming, reminiscent of lullabies from long-forgotten afternoons. The walls around you are patched with scraps of wallpaper from different eras, each pattern a testament to the passage of time. Yet here, they look brand new, lovingly illuminated by that golden glow.

With each step, your senses heighten: the comforting smell of warm bread from a distant kitchen, the softness of imaginary moss beneath your feet, the hushed whisper of wind from a hidden window overhead. You realize that this space, so seemingly ordinary—just another neglected hallway—offers a secret portal to a deeper, more dazzling universe. This is where the overlooked transforms into the extraordinary, where motes of forgotten dust become shimmering opals in the dream’s gentle light.

At last, you find a wooden door at the end of the corridor, its handle cool and smooth against your palm. When you open it, you are greeted by an impossible horizon of rolling fields and singing blossoms—flowers that chime like tiny bells, cresting on waves of color as vibrant as carnival bunting. Their spirited music washes over you in rippling harmonies, celebrating your arrival. In your waking life, you might walk right past a quiet garden bed or a faintly cracked wall, never suspecting that such wonders hide within. But here, the simple flaw that once appeared ordinary guides you to a realm where all between the cracks is alive, luminous, and brimming with the magic of possibility.

And in this dream, you linger, letting the hidden beauty soak into every fiber of your being, eager to pocket its inexplicable wonder and carry it back into your everyday world.
