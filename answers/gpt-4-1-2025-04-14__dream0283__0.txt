I am dreaming.

In the twilight-blue haze beyond waking, I find myself inside a vast, ever-shifting library. The shelves arch and curl like the ribs of some sleeping leviathan, and books breathe softly with every pulse of my thoughts. The floor is smooth glass, cold underfoot, reflecting a star-strewn sky that doesn’t belong to any world I know.

It is here, sheltered by towers of secrets and stories, that I see the person I once trusted—a figure golden-lit and familiar in the half-light, their voice as soothing as an old lullaby, always promising comfort, truth, belonging.

But something strange happens: with every word they speak, golden moths escape their mouth, fluttering in anxious constellations. Their eyes, once steady, seem to flicker with the unreliability of candle flames. A heaviness settles onto my chest as the truth blooms in me, sharp and cold: they have not been honest. Not for a long time.

Processing this revelation, I feel the world tilt, the glass beneath me rippling as if it has become water. Heart racing, I try to step away but my feet sink lightly into cool, dreamlike ripples. The library begins to distort, the shelves bending away from me as my mind reels. The books begin to whisper—snatches of memories, laughter, assurances that now ring hollow. Every surface is covered with writing I cannot quite decipher, swirling with regret and hope.

I confront the figure. My words echo and multiply, filling the air with the sound of a hundred versions of myself—pained, confused, seeking. Their face fractures, like glass struck by a stone, and behind it I glimpse shifting faces: friend, stranger, mentor, liar. A mosaic of all the roles trust can play and all the wounds betrayal leaves behind.

Tears prick my eyes, but instead of water they fall as tiny glass marbles, scattering across the mirrored floor with delicate chimes. My feelings churn: anger catching like wildfire, sorrow heavy as an anchor, disappointment swirling with the strange exhilaration of clarity. For a moment, I float—buoyed only by the knowledge that I can now see the truth, painful as it is.

Light seeps into the library—the first pure sunlight to pierce the dream—illuminating dust motes that dance like fireflies. I realize the betrayal, as disorienting as it feels, is transforming the space within me. The books rearrange. A new door materializes, carved with symbols of self-trust and courage.

I step through it, leaving the figure behind in the fading dreamlight. My heart aches, but there’s a newness inside me: raw and luminous, like dawn after a long, untrustworthy night.
