I am dreaming.  

I stand at the edge of a vast glass arena floating high above an endless sea of violet mist. Below me, the clouds pulse gently with hidden lights—emerald green, electric blue, and molten gold—each breath of wind rippling their surface like water. All around, towering pillars of polished obsidian arc up into nothingness, glowing faintly at their tips with runes that writhe like living fire. You can taste the charged air on your tongue, a quick tang of ozone and something sweet, like the memory of summer fruits long forgotten.  

In my hand, I hold the Key of Becoming—an ornate, crystalline object that shifts colors every time I blink. It represents the last fragment of a promise I made years ago, in the darkest hour of doubt, when I swore I would transform my greatest dream into reality. Behind me, an audience of silent figures materializes from the fog. They’re silhouettes at first, then as the mist parts, I recognize mentors who vanished from my life years ago, childhood friends who cheered my small victories, even the shadowy self-doubts I banished under midnight’s penumbra. Their eyes glow softly, expectant, waiting for me to prove the worth of this long journey.  

A deep gong reverberates through the air, and the smooth floor beneath my feet ripples like water. I step forward; each heel-click echoes in ten directions at once. The runes on the pillars flicker brighter, chasing away the mist in narrow columns of pure light. The wind seems to carry every heartbeat I’ve ever felt—the thundering rush of my first success, the quiet tremor of my early failures—and they swirl together in a symphony that only I can hear.  

As this pivotal moment arrives, I raise the Key of Becoming above my head. The runes on every pillar flare to life, and a single beam of white fire shoots down from the unseen heavens, striking the Key. In that instant, time fractures: I see every step that brought me here—midnight oil burning beside open books, trembling rehearsals under flickering street lamps, tears of desperation wiped away in silent rooms. I feel the warmth of my own determination crystallize in my chest like molten metal.  

And then, with a breath that feels like both my first and last, I speak the vow I’ve carried in my soul: “Let this dream become.” A pulse of light erupts from the Key, racing along the pillars, across the glass floor, and into the waiting eyes of my silent audience. The very arena hums in approval, and the violet mist below parts, revealing a horizon of burning gold—my future, waiting to be claimed.
