I am dreaming. I recall you tend to deflect praise, accepting and internalizing critics. What if we were to expand this self-inquiry into a whole-world dream? Let’s create a parallel universe where this dynamic is vividly embodied. Here’s that universe:  
The air tastes of salt.  
You wake in a desert where every grain of sand mirrors your reflection.  But the mirrors are cracked. Instead of your face, each glimpse shows a critique from your life: “You forgot to call.” “Your report was late.” “You failed.”  
The horizon hums with approval.  
Past the dunes, a celestial wave crashes, and the surf is made of every compliment you’ve ever received.  
But the water here is sentient – when you dip your toes, it whispers your strengths: “You’re trustworthy.” “Your analysis is sharp.” “You’re good at this.”  
Yet the critics-sand engulfs your footsteps, refusing to let you leave. Each time you step toward the approving ocean, a gust of wind blows salt-criticism into your eyes, blinding you.  
You find a cactus named Consistent. Its spines are kind words from your childhood: “You’re doing fine.” “I see your effort.” “Try again.” You press a thorn to your palm. The cactus bleeds liquid courage, which you drink. Now, when you face the critics-sand, it parts like water around a boat.  
As you walk toward the ocean, every step shifts the critics-sand into shapes that whisper: “You deserve this.” “You’re enough.” The waves call your name, the ‘you’ they’ve always seen. But a voice lingers in the sand: “What if they’re right?”  
Consistent cactus sprouts wings. It flies to the waves and dips into the approving ocean. Liquid courage turns a silver-blue. It circles you, offering a thorn-bottle.  
Sip. Sip. The ocean’s salt seeps into you. For the first time, you don’t want to run. You let critics-sand roll over your skin, feeling their grains not as daggers but as proof that you aren’t fragile – proof that you’ve fought.  
Now, the sand mirrors show: “You tried.” “You grew.”  
The horizon’s humming turns into laughter.  
The ocean’s approving waves touch your toes.  
In the morning, you wake up in your bed, dry but salt-stung. The memory lingers like a scar you’ll choose to wear. You notice a cactus on your nightstand with a tag: “Consistent.” Its spines glow faintly.  
Maybe the dream’s residue is the invitation to let the waves in next time – to let the sand compute.  
Let the prompt be:  
In this dream’s universe, what do you need to build from the sand, drink from the ocean, or graft onto your spine to walk toward your own approval, even when you’re avoiding it?
