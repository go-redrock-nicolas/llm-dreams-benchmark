I am dreaming. The room is filled with a haunting light, casting eerie shadows on the walls. In front of me, there's a podium, and beyond that, a group of cloaked figures whose identities I can't quite discern. Their faces remain hidden beneath hoods, but their eyes glow with a malevolent intensity.

I'm clutching the scroll containing my creative work tightly against my chest. It feels as though it's burning my fingers, and yet, I can't seem to let go. Every step towards the stage feels heavier than the last, as if gravity itself is pulling me back.

As I near the podium, the cloaked figures begin to whisper among themselves, their voices a menacing harmony that sends shivers down my spine. My heart is thundering in my chest, and beads of sweat are forming on my brow.

Finally, I reach the podium. I steady myself, taking a deep breath before unrolling the scroll. My heart feels as though it might burst from my chest as I begin to read aloud my vulnerable creation.

Words of power and beauty spill from my lips, painting vivid images in the air around me. The cloaked figures shift unnervingly in their seats, their whispers growing louder.

When I finish, silence descends like a shroud. Every eye in the room is trained on me, the cloaked figures leaning forward, their hoods seeming to envelop them.

Then, one by one, they stand, revealing their true forms. Creatures of nightmares, their features twisted and grotesque, rise from their seats. My heart is racing now, my entire body trembling with fear.

They begin to circle me, their voices a chorus of mockery and derision. But instead of feeling defeated, I feel a strange sense of power surge through me. These creatures may judge me harshly, but my creation lives on, untouched by their cruelty.

As they draw closer, their malevolent intentions becoming clearer, I realize that these creatures are not simply critics. They are the embodiment of every negative thought and cruel word I've ever experienced.

With a roar that echoes through the depths of my soul, I summon a blinding light, banishing the creatures back to the shadows from which they came. The room is plunged into darkness, but I am no longer afraid. My creation stands alone, shining brightly in the darkness.

And then, I wake up.
