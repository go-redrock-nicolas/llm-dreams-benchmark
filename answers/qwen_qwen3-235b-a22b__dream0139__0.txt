I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You find yourself standing on a bridge made of liquid glass, suspended between two moons—one made of fire, the other of frozen whispers. The sky pulses like a living kaleidoscope, bleeding hues that have no names, and the air hums with the dissonant harmony of a thousand off-key lullabies. Below you, the river flows upward, carrying fish with wings and books that scream when opened. This is the City of Inverted Reason, where the citizens wear masks of their own shadows and speak in riddles that unravel into truths only the mad can decipher.  

The people here move with a purpose that defies purpose itself. A man with a top hat made of smoke walks his pet black hole on a leash of starlight, feeding it forgotten memories. A woman with no face weeps ink, her tears pooling into puddles that reflect futures yet to happen. They greet you with sideways bows and hand you a contract written in invisible ink, demanding you “sign with your silence.” You comply, and the paper bursts into flames that burn colder than ice.  

To survive, you learn their rules:  
- To enter a building, you must first exit it.  
- Questions are answered only if they are never asked.  
- The more you understand, the less you are allowed to breathe.  

You wander into a marketplace where paradoxes are sold as commodities. A merchant offers you a vial of “yesterday’s tomorrow,” which, when drunk, makes your skin bloom with flowers that wilt as you age backward. Next to him, a vendor sells gravity in jars—some bottles weigh nothing but crush the ground beneath them; others float like balloons yet anchor the soul. You barter with a coin made of your oldest fear, which the merchant accepts only if you promise to forget its value.  

A procession passes by: the annual Festival of Contradictions. Dancers with no legs tap their feet in midair, while poets recite sonnets backward, their words stitching holes in the fabric of reality. At the head of the parade rides the Grand Paradox, a child with the beard of a thousand lifetimes, seated on a throne that exists only when unobserved. They crown you with a wreath of unlit matches, declaring you “The Herald of Unknowing,” and the crowd cheers in a language of sighs and static.  

You are invited to a banquet where the food is served in the shape of unsolved mysteries. A pie filled with the taste of first kisses crumbles into ash unless you forget how to eat. A wine that flows uphill intoxicates only those who refuse to drink. You try to savor a dish of “maybe,” but it dissolves into a debate about whether it ever existed at all.  

As the night deepens, the city begins to fold itself like origami, creasing into dimensions that pinch the edges of your sanity. You meet a mirror that reflects not your face, but your soul’s shadow—a twisted, beautiful version of yourself that laughs in equations and cries in colors. It offers you a key made of silence, unlocking a door that leads everywhere and nowhere.  

You wake just before crossing the threshold, the taste of impossible honey lingering on your tongue. The dream clings to you like a second skin, leaving you wondering: Was the madness real, or is it the only truth your waking mind dares not touch?
