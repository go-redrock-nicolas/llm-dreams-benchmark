I am dreaming. Within the depths of my unconscious mind, a vibrant tranquil garden appears.  The air is full of the symphony of birdsong and gentle rustling leaves.  The fragrance of delicate blooming flowers fills my senses and carries whispering encouragement from unseen presences in the wind.

I meander along a winding stone path discovering unexpected delights - a splashing fountain, a bench nestled under fragrant wisteria, a secret grotto with luminous crystals. Every step reveals a new wonder.  

Yet the further I journey into this sanctuary, the more I sense a shadowy overgrown area calling to me from the depths of the garden's furthest corner. I feel an inexplicable resistance, an aversion to exploring the darkness lurking beyond the beauty and light.

With every fiber of my being, I wish to avoid the entanglement of thorns and nettles, the unknowable creatures that lie hidden in the shadows of the most private recesses of my psyche. Instinctively, there is a part of me that yearns to tarry, to rest forever in the safety of the garden's unblemished perfection.

But another voice within whispers... "The greatest treasures lie hidden in the darkness."

I summon all my courage and slowly approach the dark tangled path, the undergrowth brushing against my skin, reminding me of my vulnerability. Every step is a struggle as this shadowy realm seems to cling to me, smothering me, threatening to drag me into oblivion.  

My heart pounds loudly as I force one foot ahead of the other. I'm acutely aware there can be no turning back now...and as I take one last heaving step into the darkness, I wake. Wide awake.

Now I must face the truth of what I've resisted acknowledging...what those emotions are that I've disowned, and how they've defined my self-image... and what it will mean to reclaim them.
