I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and something sweetly metallic, like rusted iron left out in the rain. The sky above is a bruised purple, streaked with veins of gold—dawn or dusk, I can’t tell which. Time here is fluid, slipping through my fingers like wet silk.  

I stand at the edge of a forest, the trees gnarled and whispering, their bark peeling in long, curling strips that reveal glimpses of something pulsing beneath—like slow, hidden hearts. I know this place. I’ve been here before. The path ahead is littered with broken glass that glints like frozen tears, and yet, my bare feet move forward, drawn by a pull deeper than curiosity.  

A voice, my own but not my own, murmurs in the back of my skull: *You always choose this. Why do you always choose this?*  

The glass cuts, but the pain is dull, familiar. Blood wells in thin lines, dark as wine, and the earth drinks it eagerly. The trees lean closer. Shadows coil around my ankles, whispering promises—*just a little further, just a little more, and you’ll find what you’re looking for.*  

I know the lie in it. I always find the same thing here: a door at the heart of the forest, warped and splintered, its handle shaped like a serpent biting its own tail. Behind it, something waits. Something that knows my name.  

My hand lifts, trembling, toward the handle. The serpent’s eyes gleam, wet and knowing.  

*This is where you wake up,* the dream insists, but I don’t. Not this time.  

I turn the handle. The door creaks open—  

And inside, it’s me. Endless versions of me, broken and stitched back together, all reaching back, mouths open in silent screams.  

The realization crashes like a wave: I’m not drawn to the pain. I’m drawn to the *familiarity* of it. The certainty. The way it makes the chaos in my chest feel like home.  

The door slams shut. The forest holds its breath.  

And then—  

I wake.
