I am dreaming. You've habitually postponed an important task despite knowing the consequences of delay. As the final deadline approaches, you feel a growing sense of panic and fear. You decide to take action and try to focus on your work. 

But then you remember that you have something else planned for this night. An event or activity that has been in your calendar for weeks now. It's a moment of celebration with friends or lovers, it's a time of fun and adventure. It's a chance to escape from reality and live in the dream world. 

You hesitate between those two options: staying home and working on your task or going out and enjoying yourself. You feel torn apart by these opposing forces that pull you in different directions.. In the end, you decide to do both: finish your work fast enough to go out later, and join the party after it's over. 

You open your computer and start working, but soon find out that there are many distractions around you. Some people knock at your door asking for help or advice some friends call you on Skype inviting you to join them in games or chat rooms. Some family members text you on Messenger wishing you a happy birthday or congratulating you on success. 

You try to ignore them and focus on your work, but their messages keep popping up and drawing your attention away from the task at hand. You feel frustrated and angry with yourself for being so easily distracted. You decide to take drastic measures: turn off all devices, disable internet connection, lock the door. 

You do that and finally manage to concentrate on your work. But then you realize that you don't have enough time left to finish it properly. You have to rush through it and hope for the best. As you are doing that, you get a feeling like someone is watching you from outside your room maybe even trying to enter it. 

You stop working and go over to the window to see who it is. But there's no one there. You feel relieved and go back to your computer only to find out that it has crashed and all your progress has been lost. You feel desperate and hopeless now. Nothing seems to be going right today. 

You decide to give up on everything and end this nightmare once and for all. But as you are about to do that, something unexpected happens: the door starts opening by itself, and someone enters your room. It's a shadowy figure wearing a hoodie and sunglasses at nighttime. 

You feel scared and curious at the same time. You want to know who this person is and why they are here. But then they start moving towards you slowly, menacingly, and you realize that maybe it's better not to know after all..
