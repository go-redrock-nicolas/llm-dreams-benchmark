I am dreaming. 1 am in a vast, otherworldly laboratory filled with glowing orbs of different colors suspended in mid-air. These orbs float in intricate patterns, their light refracting off glass canisters and peculiar instruments that hum with an almost sentient energy. Everything is sterile yet alive, the air crackling with possibility. My mission here is to align the orbs preciselyâ€”a single ripple could derail the entire operation. But then, something shifts. A metallic serpent with scales shimmering like liquid mercury slithers into the room, its forked tongue tasting the air. It coils around one of the support pillars, unblinking eyes locked onto me. The orbs begin to pulse unevenly, their harmony disrupted. How do I regain control before the system collapses?
