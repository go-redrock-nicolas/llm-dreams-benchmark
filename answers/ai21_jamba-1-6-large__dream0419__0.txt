I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, enchanted forest. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming wildflowers, and a soft, golden light filters through the canopy above. The trees stretch impossibly high, their leaves whispering secrets to one another in the gentle breeze. I walk along a path made of shimmering moss, its surface pulsating with a soft, green glow.

As I move deeper into the forest, I come across a hidden clearing bathed in sunlight. In the center stands a majestic, ancient tree with roots that twist and curl like living serpents. Its branches spread wide, adorned with leaves of every imaginable color, each one glowing faintly like a tiny star.

I feel a presence, something both ancient and wise, and look up to see a figure perched on one of the tree's lower branches. It is a being of light and shadow, its form shifting and undulating like smoke. Its eyes, twin orbs of pure gold, gaze at me with a depth that is both comforting and unsettling.

"Welcome, wanderer," the figure says, its voice a melodic whisper that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere. "You have been called here to confront something within yourself."

I feel a flutter of unease in my chest but step forward, drawn to the being's quiet authority. "What must I confront?" I ask, my voice trembling slightly.

The figure gestures to a pool of water at the base of the tree, its surface as smooth as glass. "Look," it says simply.

I kneel by the pool and peer into its depths. At first, all I see is my own reflection, but as I watch, the image shifts and changes. My face becomes a mask of discomfort, and I see myself in a familiar situation—receiving praise, yet cringing inwardly, as if the kind words are barbs rather than balm.

"Why does this discomfort plague you?" the figure asks, its voice gentle yet probing.

I hesitate, then speak slowly, my words echoing into the air. "I don't know. I feel… unworthy, I think. Like I don't deserve the praise. Or maybe I fear it will disappear, and I'll be left with nothing but my own doubts."

The figure nods slightly, its form shifting and churning. "And what if you were to see praise not as a judgment, but as a gift? A reflection of the impact you have on others?"

I frown, considering this. "A gift…" I repeat slowly. "That feels…lighter. But still…hard to accept."

"Yes," the figure agrees. "But worth striving for. Begin by acknowledging your discomfort without judgment. Let it exist, but do not let it define you. Each time you receive praise, let it settle in your heart like a seed. Nurture it, and see what grows."

I look back at my reflection, which now smiles softly, a sense of peace washing over me. The golden light around me intensifies, warming my skin and filling me with a sense of calm.

"You are more capable of growth than you realize," the figure says. "And you are not alone in your journey."

I stand, feeling lighter, more grounded. "Thank you," I say, though I am unsure if it is to the figure, the tree, or the forest itself.

As I turn to leave, I feel a gentle touch on my shoulder, like the brush of a leaf. I look back, but the figure is gone, leaving only a trace of golden light in its place.

I walk back along the mossy path, the forest alive with whispers and rustles, the sunlight casting dappled patterns on the ground. Each step feels more certain, more intentional.

And as I awaken from the dream, I carry with me the echo of the figure's words and the warmth of the golden light, ready to face the discomfort and let the seeds of praise take root.
