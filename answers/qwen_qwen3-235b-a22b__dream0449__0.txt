I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as though the universe itself is tuning an invisible instrument. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering spires of obsidian glass, their surfaces etched with glowing veins of cerulean light. At first, you assume they’re alive—*watching*, judging—but as you step closer, the light pulses gently, like a heartbeat, and you realize they’re singing. A chorus of crystalline whispers, not words but emotions: curiosity, welcome, a quiet joy. Your breath catches. You’d braced for menace, but the music is a lullaby.  

The ground beneath your feet shifts, liquid and solid at once, rippling like a pond stirred by a breeze. You glance down and see your reflection—not as you are, but as a child, wide-eyed and holding a paper lantern. The memory flickers: a night long ago, lost in a storm, certain you’d never find your way home. But here, in this dream, the lantern’s flame doesn’t gutter. It blazes brighter, casting golden ripples across the strange terrain. The child’s fear dissolves into wonder. *Maybe the dark isn’t empty*, you think. *Maybe it’s a canvas*.  

Ahead, a river of liquid starlight winds through the landscape, its current thick with floating petals that glow like fireflies. You kneel to touch it, expecting cold, but the water is warm—a memory of summer, of wading into a lake at dusk. From the depths rises a creature stitched from moonlight and shadow: a stag with antlers of spiraled constellations, its eyes twin eclipses. You freeze, a primal voice in your brain hissing *predator*, *danger*. But the stag bows its head, and in the gesture, you see not a threat, but a question: *Will you see me as I am, or as your fear invents?*  

You exhale, and the air leaves your lips as a flock of iridescent birds, each feather a tiny prism scattering light. They spiral around the stag, and as they do, its form unravels—stars dissolving into a meadow, shadows melting into sunlight. Suddenly, you’re standing in a field of colossal flowers, their petals translucent as stained glass, chiming softly in the wind. Bees the size of wolves pad silently between blooms, their fur glittering with pollen-dust that smells of cinnamon and forgotten libraries. You laugh aloud, startled by the sound—your voice, unburdened, ringing like a bell.  

A bridge materializes ahead, arching over the star-river. It’s woven from threads of light and memory: a childhood blanket, a lover’s letter, the first song you ever learned by heart. Each step across it fills you with a quiet certainty—*this is what you feared to lose? No. This is what you carry*. At the summit, you turn and see the obsidian forest, the meadow, the stag—all of it shimmering, connected by invisible threads of gold. The dream isn’t a trap. It’s a mirror.  

You wake with the taste of honey on your tongue and the echo of the crystalline song in your bones. For once, the gaps in your thoughts don’t brim with monsters. They brim with possibility.
