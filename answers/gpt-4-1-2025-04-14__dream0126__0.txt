I am dreaming. stand behind the heavy, red velvet curtain, my hands trembling as they clutch the edge of the easel. The smell of oil paint and anticipation mingles in the air. From the stage beyond, I hear the muffled hum of the gathered crowd: polite conversation, a nervous laugh here and there, the soft shuffle of program sheets. Spotlights cast golden halos against the far wall, and their heat prickles my skin.

But as I steal a final glance at my masterpiece—a colossal canvas swirling with midnight blue and sunlit amber, a whorl of cascading figures and shimmering, imagined constellations—I see it: sharp fractures slicing through the image, colors bleeding into each other where they should have remained distinct, vital details fuzzy and unfinished. Nobody else can see what I see. To them, the piece is flawless, brilliant. But to me, it has suddenly become a palimpsest of doubt.

My heartbeat crawls up my throat. Maybe if I turn the canvas, rearrange the lighting, buy myself a heartbeat more—perhaps the painting will mend itself, will live and breathe as intended. But the curtain begins to lift with a slow, theatrical groan. A curious hush falls upon the room as eager eyes seek mine.

In that blinding, expectant silence, time feels syrup-thick. I inhale the electric air. Rather than hide my flawed creation, I step forward, the canvas wheels squeaking. The moment stretches into something sacred: the audience’s collective gaze, the impossible brilliance of the stage lights, the secret cracks only I can see. And as I stand exposed before them, I realize that the masterpiece’s hidden fracture lines are a map of my own hopes and fears, proof of the struggle and longing that forged its beauty. 

So I let go—I let the flaws be seen, daring them to become part of the story. The crowd’s breaths seem to synchronize with mine. Somehow, in this vulnerable unveiling, I sense the true magic of art: not its perfection, but the shimmering, unrepeatable humanity woven through every imperfection.

I awake, heart pounding, the memory of stage lights still dancing behind my closed eyes, as if the audience is still applauding for the most honest masterpiece I could ever give.
