I am dreaming. …find yourself standing on a cracked, sun-bleached sidewalk in a neighborhood you half-remember from childhood. It is late afternoon, the hour when shadows stretch like half-sleeping cats, and heat shimmers above the asphalt. To anyone else, the scene would seem humdrum—just a row of mailboxes, a hedge in need of trimming, a rusty streetlight waiting for dusk—but in this dream, your vision sharpens like a camera lens clicking into secret focus.

You notice a puddle no wider than a dinner plate, sequestered in a dip of concrete. At first glance it is ordinary rainwater left behind by a summer cloudburst, but when you kneel beside it, the surface becomes a liquid kaleidoscope. Colors you have no names for—iridescent versions of teal and ember and moonstone—spiral beneath the skin of the water. Every ripple is a doorway. You lean closer, and the puddle blooms into a tiny, inverted sky. A flock of paper cranes takes flight inside its reflection, wingtips glowing with origami stardust.

A breeze carries the scent of lemons and old library books. The hedge behind you rustles; suddenly it is no longer leaves, but thousands of tiny green violins, bowing silent chords in perfect unison. Their strings vibrate with an unheard melody, and yet you feel the music threading through your veins, tugging at something behind your ribs.

Drawn onward, you stand and place a hand on the weathered wooden pole of the streetlight. The grain of the wood pulses gently, like the heartbeat of a sleeping giant. As dusk deepens, the lamp blossoms open—not a bulb, but a luminous flower unfurling soft golden petals. Motes of light drift down like dandelion seeds, settling on the curb, on your shoes, on the mailbox lids. Each mote becomes a miniature lantern inhabited by a firefly dreaming of distant constellations.

Neighbors begin to appear—silhouettes formed of twilight and kindness—yet none of them seem to notice the orchestral hedge or the cosmic puddle. They stride past with grocery bags and distant thoughts, untouched by the quiet sorcery. And you realize the dream’s secret: beauty is not hiding from anyone; it is waiting patiently for eyes brave enough to linger.

You close your eyes, commit every shimmering detail to memory, and whisper a promise to carry this vision awake—so that tomorrow, when you walk the waking world’s ordinary sidewalks, you will remember how extraordinary they truly are.
