I am dreaming. At first, I drift weightless above a river of molten starlight, each spark a fragment of a memory I once thought lost. Below me, the current whispers in voices I recognize but cannot name. In this suspended moment, I realize I’ve come here to revisit the time I first felt my heart crack—a summer afternoon when I watched someone I loved walk away forever.

As I let the starlight river carry me downstream, the landscape around me shifts. Towering willows with silver bark sprout feathers instead of leaves; their sighs fall like soft rain. The air smells of sun-warmed sandstone and orange blossoms. I follow a path of luminescent petals that glow pale pink underfoot, each one a snapshot of that afternoon: the tilt of your head, the way your laughter flickered out, the jagged ache in my chest. At first, it feels as though I’m still the shattered child I was then—confused, betrayed, cloaked in regret.

But the dream reshapes itself. The river rises to cradle me, and I find myself drifting into a mirrored hall, every surface reflecting another version of myself. Some mirrors show the raw, tear-streaked face I wore that day; others show the composed, wiser traveler I’ve become. As I pass from one reflection to the next, I feel the weight of each version merge and lighten my shoulders. The child’s sorrow, the youth’s anger, the adult’s weary resilience—all swirl together into a single pulse of understanding.

Suddenly the mirrors dissolve, and I stand barefoot in a field of wild poppies. Their petals open as if greeting me, and where they once bloomed in red, they now glimmer in shifting hues—scarlet turning to sunset gold, then to the pale blue of memory’s twilight. I kneel and pluck a blossom; in its center, I see your face not as the cause of my pain, but as a teacher who showed me the depth of my own heart. Holding it close, I feel forgiveness bloom, petals unfurling from my chest like new wings.

The sky bends downward, and through its curves I glimpse my life’s tapestry—threads of loss woven seamlessly into strands of growth. I realize that, over time, I’ve rewritten the meaning of that heartbreak: what felt like a fracture was really an opening, a doorway to self-compassion and a more expansive capacity to love. As dawn’s light seeps into the dream, the poppies around me shimmer and dissolve into a soft glow. And in that final moment of reverie, I rise, carrying with me a gentle certainty: the event that once felt like an ending has, in truth, always been the seed of my becoming.
