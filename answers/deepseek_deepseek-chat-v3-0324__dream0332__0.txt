I am dreaming. The world around me is an expanse of shifting colors—deep indigos bleeding into molten gold, swirling like oil on water. I stand in the center of a vast, echoing hall, its walls lined with towering bookshelves that stretch into an infinite sky, their shelves bending and warping as though the universe itself is breathing. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the bass note of some grand cosmic choir.  

Then, the book appears. It materializes from the void, floating before me, bound in cracked leather the color of dried blood. Its title is written in no language I recognize, but somehow, I understand it: *The Truth You Refuse to See.*  

My chest tightens. I don’t want to open it, but my hands move without permission, flipping the cover aside. Inside, the words rearrange themselves as I read, reshaping into arguments, statistics, testimonies—all dismantling what I have, with such certainty, believed my entire life.  

A knot twists in my stomach. The foundation of my convictions trembles. Voices whisper from the shelves around me, some mocking, some sympathetic. *"What if you were wrong?"* one asks. *"What if everything you fought for was built on a lie?"*  

The floor beneath me fragments into shards of glass, each reflecting a different version of myself—some enraged, some weeping, some laughing at the absurdity of my stubbornness. The air grows thick, suffocating, as though the weight of cognitive dissonance has become tangible, pressing against my ribs like a slow collapse.  

Then, from the chaos, a single figure emerges—a mirror of myself, but softer, unafraid. It extends a hand.  

*"If this is true, what will you do?"*  

And in that moment, despite the terror, despite the vertigo of uncertainty, something in me shifts.  

The dream shatters. I wake—heart pounding—and for the first time, I wonder.
