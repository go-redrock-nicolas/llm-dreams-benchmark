I am dreaming. I need to decide between taking a small reward now or waiting for a bigger reward later. Let me think about this.

Okay, first, what's my current situation? If the small reward can help with urgent bills or debts, it might be worth taking it. But if I don't need the money right now, maybe waiting for the larger sum is better.

There's also the uncertainty factor. Can I trust that the bigger reward will actually come in the future? What if something happens and I don't get it? That's a risk.

On the other hand, delaying gratification could lead to better long-term benefits. The larger amount might allow for investments or bigger purchases that improve my life.

But then again, what if I have an unexpected expense before the waiting period ends? The immediate reward could serve as a safety net.

I'm torn. Maybe I should assess my financial stability. If I'm secure enough, waiting makes sense. If not, taking the smaller amount now is safer.

Hmm. I think I'll go with the larger future benefit. It requires patience, but the potential gain outweighs the immediate desire.
In the swirling, opalescent mist of the dream, the choice materializes as two doors. The first, gilded and warm, hums with a low, inviting melody, its surface etched with symbols of coins, ripe fruit, and clocks frozen at the golden hour. Behind it, I sense the immediate reward: a pouch of shimmering coins that could mend my frayed coat, soothe a gnawing hunger, or buy a night’s respite from the storm I’ve been fleeing in my waking life. The air around it smells of burnt sugar—sweet, urgent, fleeting.  

The second door is carved from deep obsidian, cold to the touch, its surface rippling like a moonlit pond. When I press my palm to it, visions unfurl: a forest of towering trees with leaves made of gemstones, a vault filled with iridescent seeds that promise harvests to feed a village, a bridge spanning a chasm I’ve yet to confront. The reward here is distant, formless, vast. It murmurs in a language of constellations—*patience*, it whispers, *trust*. But the lock is intricate, bound by chains of frost, and the keyhole pulses like a heartbeat.  

I linger in the corridor between them, my shadow torn in two directions. The gilded door’s warmth beckons my trembling hands; I imagine the coins dissolving into bread, shelter, a fleeting comfort. But the obsidian door pulls at something deeper—a thread of curiosity, ambition, the primal thrill of a gamble. What if the seeds grow into wings? What if the chasm leads to a sky I’ve never seen?  

A ghostly scales appear, one side weighted with the scent of nostalgia (a child’s laughter, a candle flame), the other with the electric crackle of unspoken futures. My heart races. I think of storms yet to weather, debts both tangible and unseen. But then—the obsidian door flickers, and for a heartbeat, I glimpse a version of myself standing atop that bridge, arms outstretched, the gem-leaves raining light.  

I choose the cold door. The moment the latch clicks, the corridor dissolves. I fall through stars, through rivers of time, and when I land, my hands are empty. But the air smells of thunderstorms and possibility. Somewhere, a seed takes root.
