I am dreaming. Oh the murky, winding paths of my subconscious mind, ever churning out the most delicious, beguiling fantasies.

In this vivid dream, I found myself standing at the podium of a grand, marble-columned hall, gazing out over a sea of expectant faces. Just moments before, I had been unequivocally asserting my long-held beliefs about the sanctity of space exploration - that it was the key to our species' future, the pinnacle of human achievement.

I had always felt a deep, unshakable conviction about this, and my impassioned arguments had drawn further and further attention, until now I found myself addressing an audience of respected scientists, politicians, and even a few well-known celebrities.

My words had been flowing like a river, full of persuasive metaphor and sweeping rhetorical gestures. I felt like I was riding a tidal wave of persuasive charisma.

Then, just as I was about to reach my thunderous conclusion, a quiet voice piped up from the back of the hall, almost startling me. I craned my neck to see a bespectacled woman standing up from her seat, a tablet in her hands.

"I'm not sure I agree," she said. Her voice was calm and measured, a stark contrast to my own emotional delivery. "I've pored through the latest life cycle assessments, and it seems that the environmental impact of these exploratory missions far outweighs any potential benefits to society."

I felt a tremor run through me as the weight of her words registered. Life cycle assessments? Environmental impact? These were not arguments I was familiar with. My instinct was to lash out and discredit her challenge, to circle the wagons around my dearly held wisdom.

But something in me wavered. As I looked out at the audience, I saw expressions of concern, even sympathy, on those faces I had recently stirred with passion. I was no longer the rock-solid advocate I had been mere minutes ago.

I took a deep breath, feeling my shoulders slump a little.

"When the facts change, I change," I said eventually, my voice quiet but determined. "We must consider the whole, not just cherry-picked parts. If going to space damages our home - and us - how can it truly be called progress?"

The audience burst into applause, that pensive face from the back of the room earning a round of cheers for her pluck. I found myself applauding too, a smile fighting to reach my face.

For in going against my rock solid principles, I had found a glimpse of the unity I had been trying to rally. That even the right ideas were not be toc aggravated by facts many feel unfit to describe
