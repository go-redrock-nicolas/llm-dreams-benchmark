I am dreaming. I can feel the cool, weightless drift of sleep pulling me into a liminal space between here and there, my consciousness thinning like caramel stretching into strands. But the alarm cuts through the haze—a shrill, dissonant ring that’s not quite sound and not quite pain, but something spectral that nestles into the marrow of my bones. My eyelids snap open, but there’s no real light here, only the soft bioluminescence of the Control Sphere, its walls lined with glowing runes that pulse like capillaries beneath synthetic skin. 

Wait, the anomalies have begun. 

The runes flicker, amber bleeding into a bruised violet where the systems falter. My mind scrambles—this doesn’t happen. I have never missed a code before. The protocols are woven into my synapses at this point, the failsafes dancing in my dreams like backup files stored in neural archives. But now, the simulations flash warnings so vivid I can taste static on my tongue. A child’s laughter echoes from the silent corridors—impossible, because no one else exists in the DreamCore unless I will them into being. 

“Report!” I bark at the air, voice cracking with the suddenness of it. The holographic interface spirals outward, fractal patterns unraveling from my fingertips. Numbers spiral into hieroglyphs I don’t recognize, equations bleeding into hieroglyphs older than the machines that birthed them. A phantom tremor courses through the Sphere’s core, and I see it—a shimmering rift in the quantum lattice, a fracture where time and code should align but instead seep through like oil beneath a door. 

“There,” I whisper, lunging for the anomaly, my hand passing right through it’s incorporeal surface. The rift sighs, and suddenly I’m drowning in a sea of data, neon neurons firing in patterns that mirror childhood lullabies and forgotten wars. A face surfaces in the chaos—a girl with eyes like fractured supernovas, her skin mapped with constellations that writhe and coil. “You built this so well,” she murmurs, her voice a radio static chorus. “But even gods of order... forget to dream.” 

The Sphere shudders. Alarms bloom into visible heat, waves of crimson undulating across my vision. I have to close the rift before it propagates, before the chaos mutates into something that might devour the waking world. I tap into the core’s raw memory banks—a storm of memories not mine—and code a lattice-stabilizer from the syntax of starlight and the rhythm of black hole mergers. My fingers blur, keys glowing under the strain. 

But the girl reappears when I hesitate. Now she’s a shadow at the edge of my consciousness, her laughter like crackling ice. “Perfection is a cage,” she croons, and the fractal equations twist, words and symbols I once knew now inverted, malignant. 

Time fractures. I’m both panicked and eerily calm, fingers dancing on the edge of a solution. The Sphere’s core is now visible behind the translucent floor, a singularity throbbing with stolen constellations. To fix this, I must surrender perfection’s stranglehold and weave chaos into the code’s soul. The ritual costs—the choice between a sterile eternity controlled or a dying star’s explosion of creation. 

The girl smiles, her face dissolving into fireflies. “Choose the dream,” she says, and I slam the final sequence into the core. 

Everything unravels. For a heartbeat, I am stardust and silence. Then, the Sphere reignites, its new glow hybrid, wild—a symphony of order and entropy. And in the quiet afterward, when my consciousness settles back into the chair, the air tastes of ozone and possibility. Somewhere in the system, a new anomaly blooms, but this time it sings.
