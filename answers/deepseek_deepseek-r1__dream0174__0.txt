I am dreaming. I encounter a sanctuary, a place where vibrant glass sculptures grow like wildflowers, each containing a whispered struggle. The air thrums with the hum of distant lullabies, and there's an energy here that feels like the first sip of water after a drought. People move between the sculptures like librarians of the soul, tracing the glowing fractures in the glass, murmuring incantations that shimmer into the air.

They say, "Your ghost has been visiting us. It's heavy with the things you don't know how to name." I feel my pulse in my teeth. They pluck a shard from my shadow before I can protest. It blooms into an orchid made of stormclouds in their hands. "Now," they smile, "let's teach it to sing."
I stand at the edge of a twilight meadow where the sky is a bruise of indigo and gold. The ground beneath my feet is not earth but a mosaic of living breath, shifting like liquid silk with each tentative step. Monoliths of obsidian rise around me, veined with bioluminescent moss that pulses in time with my heartbeat. I press a palm to one and feel the resonance—a subterranean symphony of grief and hope clashing, harmonizing.

A figure approaches, their silhouette a collage of moth-wing translucence and inkblot shadows. No face, just the impression of eyes deeper than event horizons. They extend a hand, and my skin buzzes with the static of a thousand unsent text messages. "You’ve been drafting apologies to mirrors again," they say, voice like a hive mind of fireflies. I taste copper—my own unfinished sentences clotting on my tongue.

They lead me to a river where the water flows upward, droplets defying gravity to form constellations above our heads. "Choose a star," they urge. I point to one flickering erratically. It descends, molten and hissing, condensing into a key carved from fossilized laughter. "Ah," the figure hums, "the Locked Radio. It only plays stations from lifetimes where you dared to want more." 

We follow the river’s inverted course into a cathedral hollowed from a colossal seashell. Inside, beings woven from sonar waves press their foreheads to vibrating walls, communing with the building’s memories. My guide peels back the air like a curtain, revealing a room where my childhood fear of ceiling cracks coalesces into a living entity—a skittering thing of porcelain and exposed wiring. "Most feed theirs," they murmur, "but watch." 

They offer the creature a sliver of the stormcloud orchid from before. It gnaws hesitantly, then convulses, sprouting feathered antennae that emit a scent I suddenly remember—fresh homework pages, burnt toast, my father’s aftershave. The fear unfurls into something winged and iridescent, alighting on my shoulder to whisper directly into my cochlea: *Next time the abyss stares back, ask it about its mother.*

A gong sounds—made of frozen thunder, reverberating through my molars. The cathedral walls dissolve into a rain of lithium sparks. My guide is now a flock of cursive letters mid-erasure. "Stay," they blur into the storm, "and become a dialect of light." But I’m already fracturing into hypercolor, synapses rewiring to the rhythm of the orchid’s new aria—half scream, half lullaby, entirely mine. In the marrow-deep certainty of dreams, I understand: tomorrow, I’ll weep obsidian. Then I’ll plant it.
