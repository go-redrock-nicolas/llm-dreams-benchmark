I am dreaming. As I open my eyes, I find myself floating in an endless ocean of swirling purple mist. The ethereal tendrils caress my skin, leaving trails of silvery light in their wake. Sweet, intoxicating aromas dance on the air - vanilla, jasmine, and a hint of ozone.

I close my eyes, focusing on the impossible. As I open them again, a magnificent butterfly dragon spreads its magnificent wings beside me. Its scales glimmer in every color of the rainbow, prismatic light refractions flickering across their surface. The creature turns its head, locking eyes with me. In its gaze, I see ancient wisdom and playful curiosity.

I move my mind, and suddenly we're soaring through the mist, weightless and free. The dragon's wings beat in a hypnotic rhythm, each motion sending vibrations through my very being. We dance among wispy clouds, leaving golden trails in our wake.

I imagine a floating garden, and instantly we're surrounded by lush, glowing flora. Flowers of impossible colors bloom and fade in rapid succession, their sweet perfume intoxicating. Tiny creatures made of light flit about, playing hide and seek among the foliage.

I desire a cocoon of pure energy, and instantly feel myself enveloped in a transparent protective shell. The dragon playfully pokes at it with its snout, and it ripples like water but remains solid.

I will us to a vast, glassy lake, and we materialize above its mirror-like surface. Our reflections stare back, but distorted - I am a great queen, regal and powerful, while the dragon has transformed into an elegant swan. I raise a hand, and delicate lotus flowers begin to bloom across the lake's surface, creating a path towards a breathtaking palace in the distance.
