I am dreaming. The scene unfolds in a place that defies the laws of physics—a colossal library with spiraling staircases that twist upward into a star-strewn sky, each bookshelf a towering monolith of floating tomes. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as if the very walls breathe. Opposite you stands a figure draped in a cloak the color of twilight, their face shifting subtly between forms you recognize—a mentor, a friend, a past version of yourself. Their voice comes in echoes, each syllable rippling through time.

---

**You**: (voice trembling) "How could you say that? I thought... I thought we understood each other."

The words hang in the air like smoke, solidifying into shadowy spheres that drift toward the floating cosmos above. The cloaked figure approaches, their steps leaving faint glimmers on the ground, and stretches a hand toward a book. It pulses faintly, its cover etched with symbols that shift from language to language.

---

**Figure**: (softly) "We *do* understand. But understanding isn’t a static thing, is it? Look closer..."

The book opens autonomously, its pages fanning out into a waterfall of images: vistas of deserts blooming into forests overnight, cities collapsing into sandcastles, faces melting into constellations. Each frame seems to whisper a question you’ve feared asking aloud.

---

**You**: (stammering) "...What does this mean? We can’t just let things change like this."

A staircase behind you unravels into a river of liquid moonlight, and the ground tilts, sending you cascading toward it—yet your body remains suspended, disconnected from the fall. The figure catches your wrist, their touch cold but reassuring.

---

**Figure**: "Change isn’t destruction. It’s... translation." 

They lift the book, and its symbols blaze into a kaleidoscope of colors, each hue representing a different 'version' of your shared history. You see moments where laughter turned to silence, where arguments blossomed into quiet compromises. The figure’s face settles into your mother’s, then your best friend’s.

---

**You**: (whispering) "What do we do now?"

The words fade into the hum of the library. Around you, bookshelves now display mirrors, each reflecting different versions of the argument—some passionate, some silent, some witnessed by crowds or none at all. A single tome hovers between you, its pages blank.

---

**Figure**: “*Choose the story*.” 

The ground collapses entirely, and you both tumble through the stars, the library disintegrating into a storm of glowing pages. You clutch the blank book, realizing its surface isn’t empty—it’s filled with your breath, your heartbeat, the unspoken questions lingering between you.

---

**You wake**, the hum of the library still ringing in your ears, and reach for a pen.\n
