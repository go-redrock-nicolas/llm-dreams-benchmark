I am dreaming. The dream takes me to a vivid scene. I am standing at the edge of a vast ocean, the waves crashing against the shore with a fury that sends misty sprays high into the air. The sky is dark, heavy with threatening clouds that seem to almost merge with the tumultuous waters below. A lighthouse stands tall and proud a few hundred yards away, its beam of light cutting through the gloom and casting a warm glow over the water. 

Suddenly, I feel a presence beside me. It's someone I haven't seen in a long time, a person who knew me well and loved me dearly â€“ my grandmother. She is smiling softly, her wrinkled face radiating wisdom and comfort. She places her hand on my shoulder and leans in to whisper in my ear.

"You are not alone, my dear. When the waters are rough and you feel like drowning, come to the light. Let it guide you to safety, let it show you the way."

With that, she walks towards the lighthouse, beckoning me to follow. As I approach the towering structure, I feel a sense of calm wash over me. The door opens, and I step inside, finding myself in a warm, welcoming room with a roaring fireplace. There are books and couches and the sweet smell of freshly brewed tea.

A woman with kind eyes and gentle hands offers me a cup of tea, introducing herself as the keeper of the lighthouse. She welcomes me with open arms, telling me that this is a place of refuge, a sanctuary for those in need. As we sit by the fireplace, sipping our tea, I feel the burden of my crisis lift from my shoulders. I realize that I am not alone. The keeper of the lighthouse and the flame she tends provide a beacon of hope for all who seek it.

The dream ends with me waking up, my heart filled with peace and the determination to face my crisis head-on, knowing that there are people who care about me and will be there to guide me towards safety and solace when I need it the most.
