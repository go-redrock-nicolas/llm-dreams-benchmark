I am dreaming. I'm in a vast, luminous library that stretches upward into a starry sky.  The bookshelves are living, breathing organisms - their spines shift and change like skin, pages fluttering softly as if whispering secrets.  My first task is to paint the patterns on the library's ceiling with a brush that pulls colors directly from the constellations above.  Each stroke I make echoes faintly, like a bell struck underwater.  

Suddenly, I'm standing in a glass-walled control room at the bottom of an ocean trench.  A thicket of glowing, bioluminescent seaweed pulses around me.  On my desk is a machine spewing a chaotic flow of numbers and equations from its screen.  I must solve a problem before the numbers drown the system, but each solution I input causes a corresponding shift in the hues of the seaweed above.  

Then I’m in a meadow where the grass is woven from strands of human hair, each one humming a different emotion.  A woman sits across from me, her face a mosaic of shifting landscapes - a desert here, a storm there.  I need to listen deeply to her fragmented stories about a childhood memory of a tree that walked… and weep with her as if my own heart is sprouting roots.  

Switch again: back to the library’s ceiling, painting a nebula into the fresco.  The brush now feels heavy, as if the stars are resisting.  The ocean control room’s seaweed is turning a distressing, sickly green.  The meadow’s grass-hair is tangling into knots, its hymns growing discordant.  

A paradox manifests - the tasks must be resolved in unison.  To finish the fresco, I must align the equations first.  To calm the seaweed, I need to untangle the grass.  To help the woman, I have to balance all three dimensions of myself simultaneously.  Time fractures; I'm everywhere at once, fingers tingling with stardust, saltwater, and static.  

When I wake, my hands smell like ocean and cosmos, and I hum a melody made of starlight and regret.\n
