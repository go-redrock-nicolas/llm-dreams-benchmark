I am dreaming. **The Impossible Mountain**.

The air is thick with mist, clinging to my skin like a lover who refuses to let go. Before me rises the **Black Obsidian Spire**—a mountain so sheer and black that it seems to drink the stars. Its peak pierces the indigo sky, veiled in a storm of emerald lightning that crackles like a serpent’s breath. The trails leading upward vanish into a curtain of rain that falls upward, defying gravity. Even the stones scream.  

On the slopes, creatures skitter—shadow-webs spun from fractured glass, their bodies humming with a frequency only the damned can hear. My heartbeat thuds in time with the distant rumbles of the mountain’s own breath: a low, throaty growl that shakes my bones.  

The challenge is simple: climb to the summit. But the mountain fights back. My boots crackle against obsidian that melts at my touch, reforming into jagged teeth. Every step upward unravels a memory, spilling fragments of my past onto the ground—my father’s laugh, my childhood home, the way the moon kissed the lake at midnight—all of it crumbling to ash beneath the wind.  

Deep in the mountain, old gods slumber. Their whispers coil around my temples: *“You are not meant to endure. Let me eat your silence.”* But I press on, carving new paths with the dagger my grandfather left behind—a blade that flickers between steel and shadow.  

At the summit, the storm stills. The obsidian softens,pooling into a mirror that shows not the sky, but the depths of me. In the reflection, my eyes burn twin flames: one of the mountain’s rage, one of my own unquashed curiosity. I bow to the neither-known-nor-unknown, and the mountain—grudgingly—barely opens a path to what lies beyond.  

Descending, the mirror crumbles, but within the shards glint something NEW. A seed, perhaps. Or a key. Or the hum of a song only I can hear. The world feels lighter, as if the all along were a wound that’s finally beginning to scar right."

You awaken with the aftertaste of starlight and sulfur. Your hands are cold, but your fingers carry the ghostly heat of obsidian. The room feels narrower than before, and the clock on the wall ticks like a countdown. Outside your window, the dawn bleeds crimson over a skyline that seems slightly tilted—a world that’s still holding its breath, watching.
