I am dreaming. The air is thick with laughter, clinking glasses, and a strange, shimmering quality—like the world is made of silk and smoke. I find myself in an enormous hall, though “hall” feels too small, too rigid to name this place. It stretches in all directions, ever-shifting. A ballroom made of starlight? A palace stitched from thought? The ceiling glows with faceless nebulae, and chandeliers float like jellyfish through a sapphire sky above.

I know only *her*. Her name slips in and out of my memory like a fish through fingers. I need to find her, or perhaps I need to feel her presence to remind myself that not everything here is alien.

I drift through clusters of people—or beings. Or memories.

The first group dances around a table that is not a table, but an enormous hourglass filled with hummingbirds, each flickering between past and future in tiny, feathery revolutions. Laughter in languages older than sound spills from them, skin shifting tone and texture as they speak—as if they are made of sky. One of them turns to me and hands me a drink. It’s not liquid, but a song, warm and vibrating. I sip music from a crystal flute and feel centuries rush through me.

I move on.

A second group huddles like conspirators, whispering. I approach slowly, intrigued and cautious. They pass glowing bones between them, each whispering a wish into the marrow before tossing it gently into a basket woven of shadows. When one looks up and sees me, she smiles—a sudden melody of teeth. "Are you here to bargain?" she asks, tossing me a bone carved from frozen breath. I hold it, and it begins to grow warm, pulsing like a heart.

I move onward, the soft flicker of my bare feet—am I even wearing feet?—echoing like drumbeats on paper-thin floors.

I arrive at a long, winding table carved from petrified windows. Inside its glassy surface, cities asleep in twilight are frozen, breathing softly. Figures sit at the table, talking in whispers and code. They wear masks made of stories—some depict dragons weeping over lost heroes; others wear landscapes that churn and change with every blink. One signals me to sit—I do.

A woman made of smoke strokes the table and offers me a dish: a bowl of unspoken things. “Regrets or apologies?” she asks, smiling sorrowfully.

I say nothing and sip again.

The atmosphere thickens. I stand, compelled inward—drawn by something electric. A door floats like a leaf before me, without mouth or key. Behind it, soft violin hums. I reach out.

The door becomes water. I push through.

Silence.

She is there.

Alone. Still.

Our eyes meet, not with joy, not with relief—but with *recognition*. She wears the color of memories—the soft Earth tones you forget, then ache to remember. Her eyes—deep fountains lit from below—seem to draw tears from the air itself. For a heartbeat, the chaos stills.

She says nothing.

But she *does* speak, not in words, but in logicless warmth, like sunlight remembering how to warm skin. She tilts her head… and suddenly the dream shifts entirely. The sea rushes in from every wall. We are now two figures standing in water and sky. The people and their gatherings dissolve like mist.

This is the *soul-place*. The foundation under the festival. A temple without need of gods.

And as she draws close, the ocean breathes in and the dream begins to unravel, gently—like petals shedding into dawn.

And just before I wake, she says one thing in a voice that glows through the currents of dream:

“You were never alone here, even when you were.”
