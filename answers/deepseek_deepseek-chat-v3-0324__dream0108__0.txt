I am dreaming. The hospital hums like a dying machine—lights flicker unnaturally, their glow sickly and tinged with green, casting long, wavering shadows on the buckling ceiling tiles. The air is thick with the metallic scent of blood and the sweet, nauseating reek of infection. Machines beep erratically, some stuttering into silence as their power sources fail. Your shoes stick to the floor with every step—whether from spilled IV fluids or something worse, you no longer care to check.  

Patients flood the halls, not just in gurneys but crawling, limping, bleeding from wounds that shift when you look away—a gash that was a broken limb moments ago, a feverish child’s skin now splitting with something moving beneath it. The hospital is infinite, hallways twisting into impossible geometries, doors leading back to the same overflowing trauma bay no matter which way you turn.  

Supplies vanish when you reach for them. The last morphine syringe crumbles to dust between your fingers. The defibrillator cables squirm like live snakes. A nurse you don’t recognize presses a cold scalpel into your palm and whispers, *“You have to choose.”*  

Then the walls start breathing.  

You realize—with dread settling like ice in your veins—that the muffled sounds you’ve been hearing aren’t the groans of patients. They’re coming from beneath your feet. Something in the basement is waking up. And it’s hungry.  

You jolt awake, sheets drenched in sweat, the echo of a heart monitor flatlining still ringing in your ears.
