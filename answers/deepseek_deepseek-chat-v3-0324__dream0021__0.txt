I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric tension, thick with the scent of ozone and something wilder—like the charged moment before a storm breaks. The arena around me is vast, a coliseum of shimmering, shifting architecture, its walls pulsing with veins of bioluminescent light that flicker in time with the murmurs of the unseen crowd. Their whispers coil around me, half-formed words in a language just beyond understanding, brushing against my skin like phantom fingers.  

I stand alone at the center, my heartbeat a drumbeat echoing through the hollow of my ribs. My opponents materialize from the shadows—tall, spectral figures draped in flowing robes that ripple like liquid mercury, their faces obscured by masks of polished obsidian, reflecting distorted versions of my own wide-eyed expression back at me. They move with the eerie precision of beings who have played this game for centuries, their every motion a whisper of inevitability.  

The challenge is unveiled—a game not of strength, but of will. A labyrinth of mirrors rises from the floor, each pane a gateway to a splintered reality, a thousand versions of myself staring back, some confident, some crumbling. The rules are simple: navigate the maze, but beware—the reflections are not just echoes. They are alive. They hunger.  

A bell chimes, resonant and deep, shaking the ground beneath my feet. The crowd’s murmurs swell into a roar. My first step forward sends ripples through the glass, and the reflections grin, their teeth too sharp, their eyes too bright. One reaches out—cold fingers brush my wrist—  

And the game begins.
