I am dreaming. You find yourself on a dimly lit street, the sky above cloaked in a deep, velvety purple scattered with glowing stars that pulse like living embers. The air is crisp, tinged with the smell of blooming night-jasmine. Around you, shadows twist and turn, forming faint outlines of things unrecognizable yet strangely familiar. You catch glimpses of silhouettes that resemble your old friends—laughing, chatting, their figures fading like mist with each step they take. 

The street stretches endlessly before you, lined with tall, narrow houses made of glass, their surfaces shimmering with reflections of your memories—faces, words spoken long ago, moments of youthful freedom. You approach one of these houses and peer inside. The walls within are glass too, revealing rooms filled with items from the past: a high-school yearbook, a cherished guitar, a scarf you once borrowed and kept, all bathed in golden light. Yet, as you reach out to touch them, they shimmer like mirages and dissolve into air. 

You can feel the social drift like a soft wind at your back, gently pushing you forward. You walk down the street, and with each passing house, you sense the faces within becoming less clear, the voices quieter. In one window, you see a friend waving, but when you raise your hand to wave back, your reflection in the glass replaces them. You feel neither sadness nor joy—just a strange, quiet acceptance that the night has embraced you.

The street leads you to the edge of a vast lake, the water calm and reflective, like liquid silver. Across the lake, you see a grand pavilion illuminated by lanterns, its golden light flickering warmly in the darkness. Music floats toward you, a soft melody you can’t quite place but feels like a distant memory. You step onto a small boat waiting at the shore. It whispers softly as it cuts through the water, carrying you closer to the lights. 

As you draw near, the figures of your old friends appear by the pavilion, dancing gracefully. You see their smiles, hear the echoes of laughter that you recognize so well. Yet, something keeps you seated in the boat, held back by an invisible force that feels like both sorrow and comfort. They seem to sense you, turning your way, but as you try to call out, your voice catches, lost in the night air. The lanterns dim, one by one, and your friends fade from view, leaving only the music lingering softly on the wind.

You lean forward. The water’s surface ripples as your reflection forms, calm and steady. You are alone, yet the night holds you gently, and the stars pulse more brightly now, each one whispering that it’s okay. And as you let the boat take you back toward the shore, you realize the drift you felt was not a loss but the tide of time drawing you forward, onward into a story yet unwritten.
