I am dreaming. The world around me is neither night nor day, but an iridescent twilight that hums with hidden energy. The air shimmers like liquid glass, refracting illusions—flickering cities, whispering forests, dissolving into mist even as I reach for them. Beneath my feet, the ground isn’t solid but a shifting mosaic of geometric patterns, alive and rearranging.  

Then I see it.  

The device rests on an obsidian pedestal, its form constantly mutating—sometimes a flickering console of golden cogs, sometimes a smooth, translucent sphere pulsing with veins of silver light. It feels familiar, as though I’ve known it in forgotten dreams. A voice, neither human nor machine, echoes in my mind:  

*To wield me, you must become the question before seeking the answer.*  

I reach out—and the moment my fingers graze its surface, reality fractures.  

**Crisis unfolds.**  

The sky splits open like a wound, revealing a colossal vortex of writhing shadows, hungry and shapeless. The ground trembles, fracturing into bottomless cracks. Somewhere, a scream—human, desperate—splinters the air. The device thrums in my hands, its glow intensifying, but its mechanisms blur faster than I can comprehend.  

A dial shifts into a keyboard, then warps into a nest of glowing threads. A screen flickers—equations rewritten in a language of moving constellations. *It demands understanding.* But the chaos is accelerating—the vortex is peeling the world apart, swallowing fragments of the landscape.  

Then, clarity.  

I stop trying to *control* it. Instead, I *become* the question.  

I don’t ask, “How do I stop the vortex?” I dissolve into the roots of its existence—what is it? Hunger? Fear? A broken equation in reality? The device’s surface solidifies into a mirror, reflecting not my face but the vortex’s core: a loop of unraveling time, a wound in perception.  

The solution isn’t force—it’s *alignment.*  

My hands move on their own, adjusting harmonics. The device sings. Ribbons of light spiral from it, weaving a lattice across the sky, stitching the vortex closed with threads of resonance. The scream fades. The world steadies—not as it was, but as it *should* be.  

The device dims. The voice whispers:  

*You woke the answer by dreaming the problem.*  

And then—I begin to wake.
