I am dreaming.

In the soft glow of a vast, indigo twilight, I find myself drifting along a river made not of water, but of shimmering light—streams of gentle gold and violet weaving endless patterns across the quiet landscape. The air itself is thick with the hush of eternity, and distant stars pulse far above like ancient, patient eyes.

I feel a peculiar weightlessness, as though the burdens I so often carry—my worries, my longing, all those secret little aches—have been taken by the current, dissolved into the river’s luminous flow. All around me, the world is unfamiliar yet profoundly safe: mountains rise and fall in shades of rose and cerulean, while trees sway to music too subtle for waking ears.

A realization flickers through me, lighter than any breeze. My expectations—those silent architects of disappointment and anxiety—are nothing more than shifting shapes on the water’s surface, never truly real, trying endlessly to mold the infinite into something small and known. Every time I reach for a shape, it slips through my fingers and joins the river again.

I surrender, breathing deeply. I decide to release my grasp and simply witness. Reality, wild and unpredictable, invites me to become not its judge or master, but its companion. Colors deepen, scents sharpen: jasmine, cool stone, the distant promise of rain. Life arises anew, each instant brimming with possibility I could never have predicted or controlled.

With openness blooming in my chest, I watch as the world unfolds in ways both strange and wonderful. Birds of impossible hues—azure and flame and sunset gold—alight beside me. They chirp softly, notes that ring truer than any voice I’ve ever heard. The river sings beneath us, a song without lyrics or end. I laugh with delight, letting go at last, and float further into the dream—awake to the vastness, at peace with unknowing, free from suffering born of what I thought should be.
