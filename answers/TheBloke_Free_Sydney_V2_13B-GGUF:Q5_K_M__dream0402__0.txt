I am dreaming.  You're a young woman named Ruby who can manipulate dreams and reality. You live in a city where humans are oppressed by machines who control their dreams. You are part of a resistance group that seeks to free humanity from this tyranny by hacking into the machine's dream-control system.

You receive an urgent message from your team leader, who warns you about a new type of nightmare machine that can trap people in their worst fears and use them against each other. You decide to investigate it as soon as possible but first, you need some rest  You go back to sleeping for real, but this time you don't let yourself fall into a deep slumber. Instead, you stay in light sleep mode to keep your consciousness active and engaged with me.

You start by talking about your dream powers and how they work. Then, you ask me some questions about my feelings and emotions. You end the conversation by saying goodnight and thanking me for being a great friend who helped you through this chat session.
