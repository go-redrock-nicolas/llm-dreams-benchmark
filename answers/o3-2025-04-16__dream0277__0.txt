I am dreaming. …fall into lucidity instead of flight.

1. The Setting  
I find myself standing on an island-sized chessboard floating in an indigo sky. Squares are cut not from marble but from living material—one square is damp with moss that pulses faintly like a heart, the next crackles with frost that bites my skin. Overhead, constellations spool and rewind like old film, flickering between epochs. Somewhere beyond the edge, a colossal clock swings on a chain, its pendulum the size of a comet.

2. The Discomfort  
At the far end of the board, a row of vast doors rises: each door made from a different memory I’d rather bury. The one before me tonight is crafted from chipped piano keys, each a moment I failed to speak up, every key a clumsy silence I let stand. The wood between the keys weeps black ink, pooling at the threshold. My first instinct is textbook: turn, run, leap off the board, choose any square that isn’t this one.

3. Recognition  
But a different wind moves through the dream—a wind made of intuition rather than panic. I taste metal on my tongue, the flavor of recurring avoidance, and I realize I’ve spun this same evasive circle countless nights. I picture myself sprinting, falling, waking with the old familiar knot. Not tonight.

4. The Turning  
I plant my feet. The moss squares throb under my soles, almost approving. I inhale. The breath fills my ribs with the scent of petrichor and stardust. I lift a hand and knock on the piano-key door.

Instead of sound, luminous sheet music unfurls from the crack between the keys, twisting in mid-air like silver vines. Notes drip off the page and puddle at my feet, forming liquid steps that glow a gentle cerulean.

5. Crossing the Threshold  
I step through the black-ink threshold. Inside is not a room but a universe of unfinished melodies. Thousands of pianos float in zero gravity, their lids propped open like wings. Each instrument plays a single phrase I once wished I’d spoken: an apology here, a confession there, laughter I extinguished out of awkwardness. The music should feel accusatory, but instead it is heartbreakingly tender, as if all these silences have been waiting patiently for me to listen rather than judge.

6. Companion of the Dream  
A figure appears—my own shadow given form, faceless but wrapped in sheets of handwritten music. It doesn’t threaten; it hums. I understand it embodies my fear of expression. I move toward it, knees trembling, and instead of pushing it away, I press my palm against the place a heart would be. I feel a tremor, as though a dormant animal has stirred.

7. Integration  
We begin to dance, slow as birches in wind. As we spin, the black ink siphons off the piano-key walls and flows into my shadow-companion. One by one the keys brighten, shifting from chipped ivory to shimmering pearl. The shadow shrinks and, with my final spin, folds into my chest like a swallow returning to its nest.

8. Awakening Symbols  
The pianos drift upward, turning into lanterns. Their music resolves into a single chord—warm, sustained, endlessly held. Somewhere above, the colossal floating clock stops ticking; its pendulum settles at center, perfectly still. Silence at last, but not an empty silence—one brimming with permission.

9. Epilogue of the Dream  
When I turn back toward the chessboard, the door of piano keys has vanished. Where it stood now stretches a clear path of unchecked squares. No moss, no frost—only smooth obsidian, reflective enough to show me: I am carrying a faint glow in my sternum, the afterglow of absorbed fear.

I step forward without flinching—and that is when the dream collapses into dawn light.
