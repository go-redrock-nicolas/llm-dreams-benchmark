I am dreaming. I'm beneath the waves, my hands gliding over jagged rocks, the ocean pressing against my skin like a second heartbeat. I'm hunting for something, I know it, but my breath feels short, my chest clenching as the pressure of the water threatens to crush me. It's boundless and crushing, infinite and inevitable.

I kick forward, my legs heavy, the weight of the water so strong. My light catches a flash of movement—a creature, sleek and shimmering, darting just out of reach. The water ripples, dark and alive. I follow, chasing the fleeting flicker of movement, desperate for answers I can't name.

My tank sputters, and I stop, the pulse in my throat pounding. My air, failing. The walls close in. The ceiling presses down. The way I came, a dead end, crumbling behind me. No turning back. My light catches a single bubble slipping from my lips, twisting up into the void, and I force myself onward. Every motion sends ripples outward, the pressure around me rising, cutting like a blade. It's a slow dance with death, a slow pressing weight that tells me my lungs will never open again.

And yet I swim. I swim because there is no choice. Each stroke pulls me deeper, claws dragging me through cold, trembling currents. I barely see now, my vision blurred, light fading as my air runs thin. I don't even know if I'm alive anymore.

But then—there. A glimmer in the dark, just ahead. A portal, shimmering faint like moonlight. My body feels heavy, too heavy, but I push toward it, the last of my strength pouring out in a desperate burst. My fins barely move. My arms go limp. The portal grows closer, and my vision fades, the world softening as I reach for it. It waits.

And then, with a final burst of strength I didn't know I had, I break through the surface, gasping, light flooding my eyes, the pounding of my heart so loud, my chest heaving.
