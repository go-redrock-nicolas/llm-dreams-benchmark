I am dreaming. Okay, okay, take a deep breath. This presentation is everything. I can't mess this up. But why can't I remember my slides? The words are jumbling... What if they ask questions I can't answer? The room feels so hot. Are they all staring at me? My hands won't stop shaking. That smirk on Mr. Fletcher's face—does he know I'm unprepared? Wait, why is the projector melting? Colors bleeding... No, focus! Start with the introduction. But my tongue is lead. The clock hands are spinning. When did it become midnight? Why does my podium have roots growing through it?
You step into the conference room, and the air shimmers like liquid glass. The walls undulate, breathing in time with your pulse, and the fluorescent lights above drip molten gold onto the mahogany table below. Your slides flicker on the screen—not as bullet points, but as live eels, squirming in formation to avoid your gaze. When you open your mouth to speak, your voice emerges as a flock of starlings, their wings beating against the throats of the executives seated before you. 

Mr. Fletcher’s smirk has become a twitching beetle crawling across his lips. His fingers tap the table, each knock splintering the wood into fractal patterns that creep toward your feet. The podium before you is no longer wood but a gnarled oak erupting from the floor, its branches weaving through your notes, turning your carefully crafted data into lacy shadows that dissolve in the breath of the room.

You glance at the clock. Its hands spin wildly, backward then forward, numbers blooming into lotus flowers that wither and reseed with each tick. Sweat slides down your neck, but it’s not sweat anymore—it’s the hiss of a thousand tiny serpents shedding their skins down your spine. The audience leans in, their faces elongating like wax figures left in the sun. Their eyes are kaleidoscopes, fractured into prismatic shards that reflect versions of yourself: trembling, amplified, distorted.

A voice in the back of the room booms, *"And how do you propose we mitigate existential risk?"* but the words dissolve midair into black moths that swarm toward the bleeding projector light. The tangled roots of the podium snake around your ankles now, anchoring you in place as the floor cracks open beneath you. Through the fissure, you glimpse an inverted city—towers plunging into a starless sky, your own face painted on every window, mouths open in silent recitations of your rehearsal script. 

Your throat closes. You reach for water, but the glass overflows with liquid shadow that spills across the table, devouring handouts, laptops, the very edges of reality. Someone laughs—a sound like splintering ice—and you realize it’s coming from you. The walls crumble to ash. The audience rises as one, their bodies dissolving into smoke that curls into question marks above your head. 

You wake screaming into a pillow, your heartbeat a war drum. Dawn bleeds through the curtains. The clock reads 5:47 AM. You can still taste starlings on your tongue.
