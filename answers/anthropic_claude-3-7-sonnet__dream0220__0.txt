I am dreaming. In this slumbering realm, I find myself suddenly transported to a city that seems familiar yet disorienting. The buildings lean at subtle angles, and street signs display words that rearrange themselves when I look away.

I soon discover I've stumbled into the society of the "Inversus," a community where every relationship norm I've known has been completely reversed. When two friends meet, they turn their backs to each other and speak harshly—this, I learn, is their deepest sign of affection. Prolonged eye contact is considered invasive and rude, while interrupting someone mid-sentence is the height of respect, showing you're truly engaged with their thoughts.

At a gathering in a spiraling glass building, I watch as people arrive and immediately point out physical flaws in others—"Your hair looks chaotic today!" "Those shoes are wonderfully mismatched!"—received with beaming smiles and heartfelt thanks. When someone offers me food, I say "thank you" and they recoil in horror. A kind elderly woman pulls me aside and whispers, "Here, gratitude is intimate—saved only for family in private rooms. In public, you must demand what you receive as your rightful due."

I struggle to navigate this bewildering social landscape, trying to remember to frown when pleased and to walk away mid-conversation from people I find fascinating. When I accidentally hold a door for someone, they look deeply offended and mutter something about "primitive customs."

As I attempt to integrate while preserving some sense of my authentic self, the dream begins to blur at the edges. The buildings now breathe gently, and the sky shifts from indigo to a deep emerald green. I wonder—have I truly been the impolite one all along in my waking life? The question hangs in the dream air like mist as the scene dissolves into swirling patterns of light...
