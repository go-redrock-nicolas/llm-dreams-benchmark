I am dreaming. The air hums with anticipation, thick with the scent of ozone and something sweet—like burnt sugar and crushed violets. The sky above is a swirling canvas of indigo and molten gold, streaked with clouds that pulse like living veins. I stand in the center of an impossible arena—a vast, circular stage floating in the void, its edges dissolving into star-studded darkness.  

The other competitors are silhouettes at first, their features blurred as though seen through warped glass. But as the first challenge begins, their forms sharpen. One has eyes like polished obsidian, another moves with the liquid grace of a shadow. The announcer’s voice booms, not from above but from within, vibrating in my ribs: *"The first trial is memory. To claim your future, you must first face your past."*  

The ground beneath me liquefies, and I am falling—not down, but *through*.  

Suddenly, I am standing in my childhood home, but it’s wrong. The walls breathe, expanding and contracting like a living thing. The furniture is made of glass, and inside each piece, scenes from my life flicker like trapped fireflies. A challenge materializes: *Reassemble yourself.* I must choose which memories to keep, which to discard. My hands tremble as I reach for a shimmering shard—my first failure, sharp and cold. Do I leave it or take it with me?  

Before I can decide, the scene fractures again.  

Now, I am in a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflection a different version of me—some confident, some broken, some not quite human. The voice whispers, *"Which one is real?"* I touch the glass, and it ripples like water. One reflection steps out, grinning with too many teeth. "Choose wisely," it hisses. "Or I’ll choose for you."  

The final challenge is the cruelest. I stand before a door etched with the words *"What Are You Willing to Lose?"* Behind it waits my dream job, my purpose, my destiny. But the handle is made of thorns, and the air smells of salt and iron. The cost is unnamed but *felt*—a hollowing out, a sacrifice not yet understood.  

As my fingers brush the door, I wake—heart pounding, the taste of starlight still on my tongue. The dream lingers, whispering a question: *How far would you really go?*
