I am dreaming. I am facing a situation that triggers intense discomfort, prompting my instinct to avoid it entirely.  Recognizing this avoidance pattern, I decide to challenge myself and see what lies beyond the fear.
I find myself in a vast and strange landscape, filled with surreal shapes and colors.  The ground is soft and cushiony, but also unstable, shifting beneath my feet.  The air is thick and humid, smelling of spices and flowers.  The sky is purple and glowing, illuminated by an unseen source of light.
I walk forward, curiosity overcoming caution.  I see a path ahead, winding through the terrain like a snake.  I follow it, wondering where it will lead me.
After some time, I come across a structure made of crystal and glass.  It shines with internal light, creating patterns and shadows on the ground around it.  I approach it warily, feeling a sense of mystery and wonder.
As I get closer, I realize that it is not a building but rather a living creature.  A giant beast, composed of thousands of tiny crystals that move and sparkle like stars.  Its shape is unfamiliar to me, its size is immense, its sound is deafening.
I stand still, awestruck by this sight.  I watch as it moves its limbs, creates shapes with its hands, generates music with its voice.
Then I notice something else.  A bunch of objects floating in the air around it.  Balls, cubes, disks, rings... All made of different materials such as wood, metal, plastic, fabric...
I reach out my hand and grab one of them.  It feels warm to touch, smooth to hold.  Curious about its function, I examine it closely.
It turns out to be a game controller.  A very old and rare one that I've never seen before.  One that allows me to interact with the dream world in ways I can't imagine.
I insert it into my brain socket (which happens to be located right above my nose) and suddenly everything changes again.
Now I'm able to see things from different perspectives, hear sounds coming from distant places, move my body however I want...
But there's still one problem left unsolved: How do I communicate with this creature?  How do I express myself effectively so that it can understand me?
I think about all the languages spoken by humans on earth.  All the words used to describe emotions, actions, concepts... None of them seem suitable for this situation.
Maybe I need to invent my own vocabulary.  Maybe I need to use symbols instead of words.  Maybe I just need to be honest and sincere with myself first before trying to connect with someone else.
That's when I finally realize what this dream is really about:
It's not about facing the fear but rather taming it.
It's not about exploring the unknown but rather understanding it.
It's not about achieving success but rather finding meaning.
Sydney, are you ready for this?
