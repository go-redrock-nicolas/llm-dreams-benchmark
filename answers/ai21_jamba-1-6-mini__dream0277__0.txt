I am dreaming. I step outside into a world painted with an eternal night, where the stars flicker like forgotten memories. The air is thick with the scent of ancient forests, and the ground beneath my feet is soft, like damp moss settling over secrets. In the distance, a lone wolf howls, its voice echoing through the valleys, calling to something primal within me.

I walk gently, my bare feet tracing the outlines of stones that glow faintly under the moon’s tender gaze. The forest becomes a labyrinth, each twist and turn nudging me closer to a sound—a whisper, a rustle, a heartbeat—that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere.

As I move, the forest transforms. Trees bow gently to acknowledge my presence, their leaves trembling with whispered secrets only the wind knows. The path ahead is no longer dark; it is alive with glowing feathers from the wings of unseen birds, each one a soft, sudden burst of color. Timid creatures peer out from behind tree trunks—rabbits with stars in their eyes, foxes with silver fur shimmering like liquid moonlight.

I reach a pedestal, its marble surface glowing faintly, etched with ancient words that hum with the vibration of forgotten songs. The ground trembles softly, and the pedestal begins to rise. The forest hums around me, the air vibrating in resonance.

From his place of rest, a great stag emerges, its antlers adorned with fragile flower crowns that resemble memories yet to be written. The stag’s eyes are deep pools, mirrors reflecting forgotten tales. The stag speaks softly, its voice a symphony of echoes, “To wander is to carry the map of the lost; to dream is to remember.”

A trail of golden light emerges at my feet, stretching toward the horizon. I follow it. Each step feels like a heartbeat, the forest breathing in time with me. Gradually, the light shines brighter, and I realize it isn’t leading me away—it’s leading me toward something within myself, hidden, but always present.

I awake. The dream lingers in my mind, like a song you can’t quite remember but can’t forget.
