I am dreaming. In this ethereal dream, I find myself in a lush meadow bathed in an otherworldly twilight. The air vibrates with possibility as I stand beside a woman with striking blue eyes and raven hair, her presence both captivating and comforting.

As the stars slowly emerge, she begins to share intimate details of her life â€“ childhood memories, secret fears, and long-buried dreams. Each revelation draws us closer, forging an undeniable connection. Her trust in me grows, and I listen intently, forming a mental map of her inner world.

The shared vulnerability deepens our bond. Like tender shoots unfurling, trust and intimacy blossom between us. As we walk through the meadow, her hand brushes mine, and an undeniable spark of connection passes between us.

This profound dream recedes like an ebbing tide, leaving behind a haunting memory of connection and the ghost of a beautiful soul who has taken a piece of my heart.
