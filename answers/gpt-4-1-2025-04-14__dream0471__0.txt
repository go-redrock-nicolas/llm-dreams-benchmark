I am dreaming. I am drifting through a dream so rich and strange that every breath shimmers with possibility. I walk a winding path that shifts beneath my feet—first stone, then moss, then the feather-light softness of clouds. Flickers of starlight dance among the trees, and the air glows with a golden haze. A thousand doors bloom from the ground around me, each promising adventure, glory, or peace for those bold enough to step through.

But with every step, I realize something: my arms ache, burdened by bags I did not know I carried. Each bag is painted with promises—a friend I vowed to help, a project I pledged to complete, a dream I swore I’d chase. The handles dig into my palms, and I feel the weight of all I have agreed to.

In the center of the dream, a vast mirror appears, its surface rippling like a silver lake. I see my own eyes within it, wide with hope and worry. Gently, a breeze whispers through the world—I hear my own voice, calm and clear, responding to the wind: “It’s enough. You’re enough.”

With a deep breath, I begin to set down the bags, one by one, naming each as I go. “This is for later.” “This belongs to someone else.” “This is not truly mine.” The air lightens around me, and lightness fills my being. 

Between the trees, luminous boundaries appear—shimmering fences made not of iron, but of wildflowers and soft song. I realize these are not barriers of cold refusal, but welcoming boundaries that protect the lush gardens I cultivate within. I see myself inviting others inside, but gently, kindly, I close the gate when my garden needs tending or my soul needs rest.

As I breathe in the scent of moonlit petals, I awaken in my dream to a deep truth: by honoring my capacity, by setting boundaries rooted in love, I make every commitment—no matter how small—shine brighter than the multitude I tried and failed to carry.

The path opens before me, lighter now, radiant, every step a celebration of balance and self-respect. I walk onward, carrying only what is mine, and the world—my dream—softly opens its arms and sings.
