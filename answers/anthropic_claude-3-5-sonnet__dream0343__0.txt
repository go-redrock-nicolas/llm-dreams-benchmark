I am dreaming. I find myself in my office, but everything seems slightly off - the lights have an unnatural blue tinge, and the shadows in the corners appear to pulse and breathe. As I sit at my desk, scattered papers begin to arrange themselves, revealing a pattern I hadn't noticed before: subtle discrepancies in reports, missing data, altered presentations - all leading back to Marcus, my trusted teammate of three years.

The revelation hits me like ice water in my veins. Each manipulated document glows with a faint red outline, forming a web of deception that stretches across months of our shared projects. In this dream-warped version of reality, I watch as past meetings replay on the office walls like projected memories, but now I can see Marcus's slight smirk when my proposals were questioned, the calculated way he would "correct" my work in front of others.

The office begins to stretch and distort, corridors elongating impossibly as I search for him. When I finally find Marcus, he's standing in the conference room, his silhouette multiplied by dozens of reflections in the glass walls. But these reflections don't quite match his movements - each one shows a different betrayal, a different moment of sabotage.

My voice echoes strangely as I confront him, the words seeming to hang visible in the air between us: "Why? I trusted you." The room temperature plummets, and Marcus's face shifts between expressions - smugness, guilt, defiance, fear - like a rapidly shuffling deck of cards.

As he opens his mouth to respond, the ceiling begins to rain coffee, staining all of our work black, and the floor beneath us transforms into quicksand made of shredded documents. The betrayal feels physical, like thorns growing inside my chest, as both of us sink deeper into the evidence of his deception.

The dream pulses with feelings of hurt, anger, and a strange sort of clarity - the recognition that sometimes the greatest threats come wrapped in friendly smiles and water cooler conversations. As the scene dissolves, I'm left with the lingering sensation of having lost something precious: not just trust in a colleague, but faith in my own judgment.

The dream carries that peculiar logic where emotions become tangible things - betrayal has a color (deep burgundy), disappointment has a taste (bitter copper), and professional threat feels like shadows with teeth, nipping at my heels as the scene fades to black.
