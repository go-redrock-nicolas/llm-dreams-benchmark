I am dreaming. You encounter a cryptographic puzzle with implications for foundational information theory that has remained unsolved for decades. As you approach it from unconventional angles, you make progress and feel exhilarated. You meet a researcher who recognizes your unique perspective and invites you to collaborate. They give you access to their private notes and resources, which further inspire you. But then, the dream fades away, leaving only a sense of longing and curiosity.

You wake up disappointed but hopeful. You decide to continue exploring this area of research in your waking life too. You feel eager to share your findings with others who share your passion and dedication.
