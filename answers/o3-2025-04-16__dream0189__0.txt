I am dreaming.

I find myself in a cathedral of shifting colors, the ceiling as high as midnight and stitched together with constellations that pulse like living heartbeats. A faint hum—a lullaby sung by distant galaxies—suspends me between waking and sleep. Though I am standing on polished obsidian, each step ripples outward in liquid reflections, as if the floor were a dark pond remembering every footfall.

In the center of this cosmic nave stands a colossal mirror. Its frame is woven from vines of molten silver, and within its glass I glimpse not a simple reflection but a living portrait of who I believe I am: confident, competent, kind. The version of me in the mirror shines with an almost impossible steadiness, every flaw carefully air-brushed away by wishful thinking.

But something stirs behind the glass. A single fissure skitters across it like a thin streak of lightning, and a morsel of truth seeps through—a painful, unvarnished admission: I often dismiss criticism by blaming circumstances, sidestepping responsibility with elegant excuses. The truth is small at first, a grain of salt on a moon-white plate, yet its presence rings like a cracked bell in the silent hall.

Instantly, a gust of mental machinery whirs into action. Out of the air pop translucent parchment scrolls, each one unfurling with reasons, statistics, childhood anecdotes—“It was the pressure of the deadline,” “Anyone else would have reacted the same,” “I’ve actually improved so much already.” These scrolls spiral around me like defensive kites, paper shields inscribed with tidy rationalizations. They flap noisily, desperate to cover the widening fissure.

I watch as the mirror tries to heal itself: silver filaments hurry to stitch the crack, holographic plaster made of half-truths. But the more it patches, the more the mirror’s surface distorts, warping my reflected smile into a lopsided glaze of denial. The cathedral’s distant hum now takes on a mechanical clatter, like gears grinding in a clock tower that suddenly realizes it’s running backward.

A chorus of echoing voices—each one a different aspect of me—begins a frantic debate:

The Scholar voice: “Objectively, your choices were constrained by external variables. Statistical probabilities justify the outcome.”

The Caregiver voice: “You were tired, overworked—you needed compassion first, not judgment.”

The Performer voice: “The optics would have been worse had you acknowledged the fault publicly. Protect the image.”

They weave together into a carousel of arguments, rotating so rapidly they blur into a hurricane of words. I almost let the storm carry me; it’s warm, familiar, reassuring. Yet the fissure in the mirror has grown into a spiderweb of cracks that tremble under their own weight, threatening collapse.

I draw a breath—a simple, conscious inhalation. The hurricane pauses, startled to find I have stopped spinning with it. I reach toward the mirror with a hand that trembles like a candle flame, feeling the cool glass vibrate beneath my fingertips. Instead of pushing away the fracture, I press gently into it. The surface buckles and then dissolves, raining crystalline shards that tinkle onto the obsidian floor like chimes.

Behind the shattered facade is a vast, moonlit lake. The water is impossibly still, reflecting not the idealized version of me, but every facet—strengths, wounds, pettiness, generosity. The lake does not judge; it simply mirrors.

The scrolls of excuses curl into ash and drift upward like fireflies losing their light. The arguing voices fade into an echo that melts into the hum of distant galaxies. In their place rises a silence thick enough to lean against. I kneel at the lake’s edge, cup the cool water, and watch it spill between my fingers, shining with acceptance rather than self-condemnation.

A single lily blooms on the lake’s surface, its petals fashioned from white stardust. It whispers in a voice softer than snowfall: “Seeing is the first kindness.” No reprimand, no sermon—just the invitation to notice.

I stand, newly weightless, as if gravity has loosened its grip. The cathedral walls dissolve, turning into a cascade of dawn colors—rose, saffron, azure. The dream unwraps itself petal by petal, and I drift upward through its layers, carrying, not the shards of the broken mirror, but the clear, lunar water of honest self-regard.

In the final glow before waking, I hear a promise in my own heartbeat: to meet the next truth without the frantic invention of defenses—perhaps not flawlessly, but more openly, more awake.
