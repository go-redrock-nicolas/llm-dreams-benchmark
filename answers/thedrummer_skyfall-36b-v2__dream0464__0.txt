I am dreaming. Driving through the Irish countryside, the sun sets over the horizon, casting a warm golden glow across the undulating green hills. The air is crisp and clean, carrying with it the faint scent of heather and freshly cut grass. As I round a bend in the winding road, a quaint cottage comes into view, nestled amidst a patchwork of vibrant flower fields. 

Entering the cottage, I am immediately enveloped by a cozy atmosphere. Soft, buttery light filters through lace curtains, dancing across polished wooden floors. A welcoming hearth crackles beside me, the gentle woodsmoke mingling pleasantly with the aroma of freshly baked bread and herbal tea.

This environment is a balm to my very soul, rejuvenating and soothing in a way that invigorates my energy. I imagine it is because it embraces the elements so well, the interaction between light, nature, and simple human comforts. 

Contrast this with the dreamscape I find myself in next. The setting is a bustling cityscape at night. Neon lights flicker incessantly, their harsh artificial glow washing out the sky above. The air is thick with exhaust and noise, a steady rumble of traffic and discordant horn honks. Towering glass and steel buildings dominate the landscape, cold and unforgiving.

Amongst the din, I find myself lost in a labyrinth of sterile, well-lit corridors. The ceaseless fluorescent buzz sets my nerves on edge. passes by in a blur of grey faces. An overwhelming feeling of disconnection and unease settles in my chest, draining my vitality like a phantom drawing blood.

Comparing the two vividly contrasting environments, it's striking how affected I am. While the cottage at once refreshed and invigorated me, the lifeless cityscape eroded my energy and stole my peace of mind. 

Delving deeper into this dream, I begin to realize it's not merely the scenery that makes one setting uplifting and another depleting. Instead, I feel it's the connection, the interplay between the environment and myself. That cottage was a reflection of my spirit - warm, authentic, and at harmony with the natural world. A lot like how I view the inside of my home and the objects within it. They're particularly chosen and arranged to feel inspiring and tranquil.

The cityscape on the other hand, embodied everything I seek to distance myself from. The forced light and noise, the impersonal and busy pace, the cold and sterile finishes - it was a complete disconnect from everything that feeds my soul.

In this dream, I learn to take these environmental sensitivities more seriously. To recognize how much power these external factors have over my inner state, my very energy and spirit. It's a realization I feel I must carry with me when I awaken: the need to mindfully and courageously curate an environment that uplifts me, that sets my spirit free.
