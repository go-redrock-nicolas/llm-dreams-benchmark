I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a room where all the furniture is slowly melting like candle wax, dripping in muted pastels of cream and grey. The realization of betrayal washes over me in waves of translucent color - first a sickly yellow, then a deep indigo that seems to seep from the corners of my vision. The trusted person's face appears in fragments in every liquid droplet falling from the dissolving ceiling, each showing a different lie, a different moment of deception.

The floor beneath my feet begins to ripple like disturbed water, and with each wave, memories surface like bubbles - shared laughs that now sound hollow, promises that shimmer and pop like soap film, revealing emptiness behind them. The walls of the room breathe in and out, expanding and contracting with my growing anxiety.

Suddenly, written words begin to float through the air, each one a truth I had missed, glowing with an uncomfortable fluorescence. They swirl around me like autumn leaves in a wind tunnel, some burning my skin when they touch me, others dissolving into bitter-tasting mist.

The room starts to tilt, and everything - the melting furniture, the floating words, the fragmented faces - begins sliding toward one corner where a dark vortex has formed. It's pulling in all the false memories, all the manufactured moments, leaving behind a stark, clean emptiness that feels both terrifying and liberating.

As the last drops of deception swirl down the void, I feel myself becoming lighter, almost transparent, as if the weight of carrying someone else's lies had been physically manifesting all along. The dream-space around me starts to crystallize into sharp, clear facets, each one reflecting an unvarnished truth I had been too afraid to see.

In this moment of clarity, even the air tastes different - sharp and clean, like the first breath after a thunderstorm. The betrayal doesn't hurt anymore; instead, it illuminates, casting everything in a new, unflinching light that reveals not just the deception, but also my own strength in surviving it.

The dream begins to fade, but not before everything transforms into butterflies made of shattered glass, each shard carrying a fragment of wisdom gained through pain, scattering into the infinite space of consciousness.
