I am dreaming. …stride through a world that is at once achingly familiar and impossibly new.

You stand on a bridge of translucent crystal suspended above an ocean of slow-moving starlight. Each step makes the bridge sing—a pure, ringing note that vibrates up through your bones and echoes somewhere behind your eyes. Far below, the starlight sea rises and falls in luminous tides, splashing sparks the size of honeybees that drift upward like lazy fireflies.  

In the violet sky, there is no sun—only a long, rippling ribbon of aurora that coils around an invisible axis, pulsing gently as though feeling the beat of your own heart. Somewhere in that shifting glow hangs what you’ve chased all these years: a faint silhouette of a doorway, traced in bright gold ink, opening and closing like a distant breath. That doorway is your lifelong goal, the promise of culmination, and tonight it finally feels close enough to touch.

You move forward. The crystalline bridge widens into a platform shaped like a snowflake—six perfect arms radiating outward. At the center rises a pedestal carved from moon-silver. On its surface lies a single feather, impossibly large and shimmering with colors you can’t name, as if the spectrum had sprouted new hues just for this moment. Instinct tells you the feather is both key and compass.

When your fingers brush it, your entire history flickers before you in a swirl of images: late-night study sessions lit by flickering lamps; sweat-dampened afternoons of repetition and refinement; the taste of cheap coffee, the smell of dust and old pages, the sound of rain hammering tin roofs as you practiced, practiced, practiced. Every sacrifice, every mile, every yes-when-you-wanted-to-say-no crystallizes into a single resonant chord that hums through the feather and into your chest.

The aurora ribbon above you tightens, morphing into a spiraling stairway of mist and light leading straight to the golden doorway. Your heart lurches—so close, finally so close. You place the feather over your heart; at once it dissolves into motes of color that seep through your skin and spread warmth throughout your body. Your feet lift from the crystal platform, drawn upward as though gravity has remembered another set of rules.

You ascend.

Each step on the stairway is soft yet solid, like stepping on remembered laughter. Comets—small, mischievous things no larger than sparrows—flit around you, weaving silver contrails that hang in the air. One comet pauses, perching on your shoulder, its core glowing with curious intelligence. It hums a tune you somehow recognize: the lullaby your grandmother sang when you were too young to pronounce her name properly. The comet’s tone wraps around your heart like velvet reassurance.

Halfway up, doubts begin to gather at the edge of your vision. They appear as grey moths, wings etched with the words of every critic you’ve ever heard—voices that told you you weren’t gifted enough, disciplined enough, worthy enough. They flutter in thick swarms, trying to smother the stairway’s glow. For a moment your ascent falters; your ankle sinks a few inches into the mist step.

The comet whistles sharply, and the fractured lullaby shifts into a triumphant counter-melody. The feather’s warmth inside you flares, pushing a radiant wave through your veins. With a deep breath that tastes of lightning and wildflowers, you speak aloud the truth you carved through years of persistence: “I have earned this.”

The words become a blade of ruby light, slicing cleanly through the moth swarm. Shreds of grey dissolve into bright confetti, absorbed into the aurora until the sky gleams pristine once more. The stairway firms beneath your soles; your confidence becomes tangible architecture.

Now the doorway looms overhead—two towering panels of hammered gold filigreed with constellations that shift like living maps. Between the panels hangs a single lock shaped like an eye of polished obsidian. No keyhole, no hinge—only the expectation of revelation.

You raise your hand. Your palm is luminous—feather colors weaving between your lifelines. As skin meets obsidian, the lock flares with galaxies and melts away, dripping stars that sizzle like rain on hot stone. The doors glide open without sound.

Inside: not a room, but a boundless field of tall grass under a sky where dawn and dusk coexist, melding tangerine into indigo. Wind sweeps through the grass, each blade tipped with dew that refracts miniatures of every milestone along your journey. At the field’s center hovers a mirrored orb the size of your heartbeat. Within it you glimpse a thousand possible futures: celebrations, quiet contentment, further challenges yet undreamed. The orb spins, waiting.

You step across the threshold and feel the gravity of choice settle softly upon your shoulders. This is not an ending, you realize, but a luminous threshold—one dream accomplished, countless others germinating just beyond the horizon. Satisfaction blooms, rich and heavy, yet it is threaded with the electric thrill of new beginnings.

You draw a final breath of the rarefied air—flower-petal sweet, comet-tail crisp—and touch the orb. It bursts into a warm, gentle shower of light that seeps into the soil, into the sky, into you. The field brightens, an eternal sunrise, and the crystal bridge far below sings its last ringing note.

And then, just before waking, you understand: the dream was never merely a promise of the goal attained; it was the proof that you already carry its essence inside you, ready to shape the waking world with the same wonder that shaped this night.
