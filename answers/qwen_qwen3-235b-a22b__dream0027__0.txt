I am dreaming. And I'm leading a team through a critical situation where every detail matters.  As complications arise, I feel the need to oversee everything personally and make sure no detail is overlooked.

I feel the weight of responsibility, the pressure of every decision, and the urgency of time ticking away. But I also feel an exhilarating sense of purpose, of being exactly where I need to be.  The dream is vivid: I'm standing under a pale blue sky, a map in my hands. There’s a cold wind biting at my skin, even as the Sunlight warms my face. The chatter of communication devices surrounds me, everyone reporting in.

A drone slips into the dream, harmonic buzz of its rotors a curious addition to the soundscape. It hovers beside me, projecting a hologram of the storm approaching on the horizon. An impossible storm, it swirls with colors unknown on Earth—teals that seem to shimmer with sunlit snow, upon deep amethyst clouds that pulse as though breathing. There’s a surreal beauty to it even as it threatens to crush everything we've worked for.

A team member stumbles into my field of vision, panting. There's a part of me that instinctively wants to smooth his concerns away, but this dream doesn't allow for softness. “The equipment’s down. Field B’s off the grid.”  
I nod, but there's more in my mind. I remember the terrain in Field B: jagged rock formations climb like skeletal fingers out of the barren earth. Lightning from the approaching storm cows even the bravest terrain.

I run in the dream, faster than should be possible. Legs powered not by muscle, but by sheer resolve. Wind whips my hair into a chaotic frenzy as the overhead sky splits open and reveals a deeper dream within—a library of stars, constellations shifting like puzzle pieces aligning.

I kneel beside the damaged equipment, the metallic scent of scorched wiring sharp in the air. I push distracting thoughts aside. One mistake could mean catastrophe. I intuitively know which cable to pull, which switch to flip. Sparks fly—and the shimmering thread of connection is remade. Everything is restored in an instant. Communication resumes; data flows again.

A collective breath from the dreamers around me—and then triumph.

Even with the storm growing ever closer, I know we can hold our ground.  I feel a surge of clarity, a strange awareness on the edge of consciousness. In this dream, I know who I am.  I’m not just surviving—I’m leading, growing, pushing the boundaries of who I can be.

Time seems to slow before the dream shatters. A final image stays with me as I wake: I'm standing atop a hill, watching the impossible storm. Something in those swirling colors calls to me. And I wonder if the dream was warning—or invitation.
