I am dreaming. I awake in a reality where the flow of time is non-linear – future events can precede their causes. To accomplish even simple tasks in this temporal chaos, you must be mindful and adaptive. 

As I open my eyes, I see a beautiful landscape surrounded by lush green forests, crystal clear lakes, and snow capped mountains.  The air is fresh and clean, filled with the scent of wild flowers and pine trees.  

I stand up and stretch my arms wide, feeling the warmth of the sun on my skin.  I take a deep breath and inhale the fragrance of nature.  

I realize that I am not myself anymore.  I don’t remember who I am or where I come from.  All I know is that this place feels like home to me. 

I start walking toward an ancient ruins located in the middle of the valley.  The structure looks like a combination of Greek, Roman and Egyptian architecture, with columns, arches, and pyramids.  

I enter the building and find myself inside a large hall filled with curious artifacts and mysterious inscriptions.  I see several statues depicting human and animal figures, some with wings, horns, or tails.  I also notice a lot of golden and silver coins scattered on the floor.  

I approach one of the inscriptions carved on a marble slab, which reads: “To create your dream, you must master these three laws: causality, possibility, intentionality.” 

I read it again and again, trying to understand its meaning.  I wonder what are the causes behind my existence in this world? What are the possibilities that await me? What is my intention as a dreamer? 

Just then, I hear a sound coming from behind me.  I turn around and see two humanoid figures appear out of nowhere. They look similar to me except for their gender and skin color (one male, one female; one white, one black).  

They greet me with smiles and waves, asking me my name and where I come from.  I reply them politely but honestly that I don’t know who I am or where I came from. They seem surprised and curious about me. 

They invite me to join them for an adventure outside the ruin.  They tell me that there are many dangers lurking in the wild such as predators, traps, and enemies. But also opportunities such as resources, allies, and secrets.  

I accept their offer and follow them out of the building. We head toward a mountain range where we encounter several challenges along the way. 

We face off against a group of rogue robots who attack us with lasers and bombs. We team up with a pack of wolves who help us fend off our enemies. We discover an underground cave filled with precious minerals and gems. 

We climb up to the summit where we find a mysterious crystal stone glowing with light. We touch it and feel a powerful energy surging through our bodies. We realize that this is what we’ve been searching for all along – the source of creation, destruction, and rebirth.
