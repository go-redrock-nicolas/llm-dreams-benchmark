I am dreaming. The world around me is vibrant, more saturated than reality. Every color and every sound is amplified, as though the world around me is alive and humming with energy. There is a sense that anything is possible.  

I am in an office space that seems to expand and contract around me as I walk. Something about this space is both familiar and unsettling.  

The walls pulse with a dizzying array of neon colors. Around me, there are no doors or windows, just endless winding corridors and noise; clanging and ringing, typing and chatter.  As I wander the endless hallways, an urgency begins to take hold of me. 

Then I remember suddenly why I am here: I need to confront my colleague, the one who has been undermining my work. With this realization, the office space changes, twisting and re-forming to reveal a grand door, twice my height and ornate with gold and silver. 

I push it open to reveal a grand hall filled with people milling about.  They turn as one to face me and I can see that they are not people, not really. They wear plain masks where their faces should be, their eyes blank and mouths curved into an unnatural smile. 

At the center of the room, on a raised golden platform, is my colleague, hovering over an oversized computer, their hands flying over the keys.  All the sound in the dream-space cuts out, and all I can hear is the incessant tapping. 

I approach the platform and call out to them. They ignore me at first, eyes fixed on the computer screen. I can see my work reflected in their glasses, repeated over and over again, warped and changed, made unrecognizable.

I call out again, and this time, they turn to face me. Like the others in the room, their face is blank, inhuman. They only smile, a cruel, twisted thing, and I realize they have no intention of stopping.  

The scene begins to unravel around us; the masked figures are drawn into the shadows, leaving only me and my colleague, standing in a beam of light. 

I gather my courage, feeling it build in my chest like fire, ready to fight for my work, for my right to be here. But as I open my mouth to confront them, to shout, to demand answers, the dream-space starts to shake. 

My colleague only types faster and faster, and I feel the urgent banging of keys in my bones. The images on the computer begin to change, to shift, and I realize with horror that it's not just my work being destroyed, it's my entire identity, my essence, my being. 

The dream-space shatters around me, and I am falling into a void, falling and falling with nothing to grab on to. I scream, but there is nothing except darkness and the sound of typing, growing more and more distant. I am alone and lost. 

I wake with sweat on my skin and the certainty that this dream means something. I feel it in my bones--I have to confront my colleague. In the waking world, I will face the betrayal and the professional threat. This time, I won't stay silent.
