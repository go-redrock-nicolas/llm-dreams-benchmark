I am dreaming. I find myself in a cavernous chamber with walls that seem to breathe, glistening with an oily iridescence that catches non-existent light. Before me stands a towering contraption of impossible geometry—the ancient machine. Its brass and copper components spiral in patterns that hurt my eyes when I try to follow them, while crystalline tubes pulse with a liquid that might be quicksilver, might be starlight.

The air grows heavy with the scent of ozone and cinnamon as a rumbling begins behind me. I turn to see the chamber's entrance slowly closing, darkness seeping in like black fog. Something moves within that darkness—something with too many limbs and hungry intentions.

My fingers trace the machine's surface, finding it unnervingly warm, almost alive. Intricate dials click beneath my touch, responding to some language my conscious mind doesn't understand, but my dream-self somehow does. Symbols etched into the metal begin to glow with an amber light, rearranging themselves as I watch.

A memory surfaces—not my own, but belonging to this place. I see shadows of previous operators, their hands moving in precise sequences across control panels that shift and morph between realities.

The darkness draws closer. The hungry thing within it makes sounds like glass breaking underwater.

Instinctively, I press my palm against a circular indentation at the machine's heart. Pain flashes up my arm as the machine samples my essence. The mechanism awakens—cogs turning, whistles releasing steam in harmonic tones, crystals resonating at frequencies that make my teeth ache and my vision blur.

The machine doesn't just operate—it sings. It's translating something fundamental about existence into music, into mathematics, into escape.

Reality folds around me like origami as the machine's purpose reveals itself—not merely a device, but a key between worlds. As the hungry darkness lunges, the machine completes its cycle, and the floor beneath me dissolves into a spiral of golden light.

I am falling upward, through memories that aren't mine and possibilities that might become true, guided by the ancient machine's impossible calculations toward awakening.
