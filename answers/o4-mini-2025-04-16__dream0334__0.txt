I am dreaming. You are dreaming. At first, everything feels hazy—an indigo sky strewn with rose-pink clouds drifts overhead, and beneath your feet the ground pulses gently, as if you walk on a living heart. You sense it before you even realize you feel anything: a low, rhythmic vibration beneath your soles. Your pulse quickens, your breaths come shallow, and a subtle heat gathers at the base of your throat.  

Paying attention to these bodily signals, you let them guide you like a compass. The flutter in your chest points you forward, urging you to step through a curtain of mist that parts with a soft, humming welcome. On the other side, you find yourself in a forest of crystalline trees. Their branches chime with every breeze, sending sparks of light dancing across your skin. Goosebumps rise along your arms as this otherworldly melody swells.  

You become keenly aware of your heart’s racing—each beat a drum sounding an invitation to explore deeper. Driven by that internal rhythm, you follow a narrow path of luminescent stones. With each footfall, the stones glow brighter, and a cool, minty scent drifts through the air, filling your lungs with a reassuring calm. But your stomach twists in excitement, reminding you that wonder can be tinged with fear.  

Ahead, a pool of liquid moonlight waits. The surface swirls with silver patterns that mirror your own pulse, and you feel a sudden warmth pooling in your belly. Before any thought can form—fear, curiosity, delight—you’re drawn to touch the water. The moment your fingertips break the surface, ripples of color shoot outward, painting the forest in teal and gold.  

A voice, melodic yet distant, calls your name. You realize it’s not from outside but rising from within your chest. Your body’s signals—quivering excitement, a gentle tightening at your temples—translate themselves into song. You hum in response, and the crystalline branches lean closer, as if listening.  

In that instant, you understand: this dream is alive, and you are both its creator and guest. Every shiver of anticipation, every pulse of delight, sculpts the world around you. And so you breathe in unity with your body’s own language, stepping deeper into the dreamscape where emotion and sensation fuse into pure, boundless imagination.
