I am dreaming. …close your eyes inside the dream and let its scenery reshape itself around the thundering beat of your heart.

1. The Shattering Moment  
A parchment-colored sky crackles above an endless marble plaza. In the distance, a clock tower shaped like an hourglass strikes once—an ache of bronze that ripples through your bones. This is the instant the devastating news arrives. Every white tile beneath your feet spiders with fractures, each crack glowing a different hue of grief: bruised violet, fever-red, sea-green.

2. The Storm of Feeling  
From those fissures rises a storm made of ink-dark wind and echoing voices. It circles you like a cyclone of torn diary pages, each scrap shouting a memory: laughter at a summer fair, fingertips on piano keys, plans that will now never unfold. The air tastes of iron and rain, and the plaza tilts, threatening to drop you into the maelstrom of your own sorrow.

3. The Decision to Hold Steady  
But you remember—somewhere underneath the gale—a promise to remain composed. You dig your heels into the slippery marble. With both hands you gather a handful of the swirling pages, pull them close, and whisper, “Pause.” Instantly, the pages freeze mid-air, hanging around you like a paper galaxy. Time itself hushes, waiting.

4. The Library of Breath  
With the wind muted, you notice a door behind the motionless storm: a simple wooden archway painted the color of sunrise. You step through and find yourself in a circular library whose walls are made of slow-beating hearts instead of books. Each heart glows dimly and turns its pages of muscle in tranquil rhythm. A silver ladder leans against the nearest wall; on its rungs are words rather than wood—Calm, Clarity, Courage—each one solid enough to climb.

You place your foot on Calm. The rung pulses cool, like holding a river stone. Inhale deeply; the breath tastes of lavender and cedar. You climb to Clarity. Exhale—the scent is crisp mountain air. Higher still to Courage. Inhale once more, and your chest feels armored in warm light.

5. Returning to the Plaza  
You descend, carrying the three words cupped in your palms. When you step back through the door, the cyclone waits, frozen. One by one you press the glowing syllables into the winds. Where Calm touches, the tempest’s pitch lowers to a gentle hum. Where Clarity lands, the vortex’s edges sharpen into discernible strands of thought. Where Courage settles, the storm’s dark center softens to reveal a hidden core: a hollow the color of dawn.

6. Alchemy of Emotion  
You walk into that calm eye. Within it stands a forge made of mirror glass. You lay a single tear on its anvil; it becomes liquid silver, then solidifies into a small key. The key bears the initials of everything you still hold dear. You tuck it into your pocket, a reminder that even anguish can be transmuted into something purposeful.

7. Composure Achieved  
As you exit the eye, the pages, now quiet, descend like confetti and reassemble themselves into a tranquil lake across the plaza. The fractured tiles knit together, leaving only hairline filigrees of gold where they once broke—kintsugi paths that sparkle under the parchment sky, evidence of hurt transformed rather than erased.

8. Waking Echo  
A feather-light bell rings in the hourglass tower. You feel the dream begin to dissolve, but the ladder words linger on your tongue like a mantra:

Calm.  
Clarity.  
Courage.

You open your waking eyes. Somewhere inside, the library door remains, waiting for the next storm—and you carry its key in your pocket, gleaming quietly, proof that composure is not the absence of emotion but the artistry of holding it.
