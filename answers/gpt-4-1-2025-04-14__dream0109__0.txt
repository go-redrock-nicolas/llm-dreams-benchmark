I am dreaming. …I find myself blinking into consciousness beneath an indigo sky, where gravity pushes upwards instead of down. My body—strangely weightless, almost floating—settles on the underside of a vast, crystalline city suspended like an inverted cathedral. Here, buildings sprout downward from impossible clouds, their roots winding up into the heavens above, while people stroll casually across luminous walkways clinging to the city’s underside, heads pointed toward the endless blue above.

I am both disoriented and awestruck. Time here moves in cycles that loop back, so every moment is both a beginning and an ending, births and farewells happening simultaneously. Sound drifts not from mouth to ear, but from ear to mouth; in conversation, I must think my responses so others can absorb them, and their thoughts echo into my ears like a private, melodic wind.

To integrate into this paradoxical society, I must first master the art of walking on the sky—a special form of dance requiring quick, inverted steps and confidence in the upward pull. My guide, a tall figure whose shadow glows with light instead of darkness, demonstrates how to tether my own light-shadow onto an orbiting crystal above, keeping me from drifting endlessly into the ether.

Food, I learn, is not eaten but sung to life. I stand in a circle of newcomers, voices weaving together intricate harmonies to coax flavors into existence—sweet notes for fruit, low growls for rich broths, a burst of laughter to bring forth golden bread that appears in the air, dissolving deliciously as it passes through my palms.

Most remarkable of all is how truth functions in this world: lies weigh nothing, insubstantial as mist, while truths are dense and radiant, clustering together around those brave enough to utter them. To belong, I must carry my truths openly; if I hide them, I float away, untethered. I speak my name, my strangest memory, and the faint hopes collecting at the edges of my heart, and at that moment, the citizens surround me in a shimmering embrace.

Here, belonging is not about sameness, but about the willingness to reveal the gravity of one’s own unspoken stories. I feel myself rooting, at last, to this beautiful, inverted city, adapting to the reverse realities spun from the deepest wells of the world’s dreaming.
