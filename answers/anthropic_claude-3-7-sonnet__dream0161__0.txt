I am dreaming. I'm traversing a narrow mountain ridge during an unexpected blizzard with rapidly deteriorating visibility. As the path becomes increasingly treacherous and my extremities begin to numb, I notice something unusual through the curtain of swirling snow—a faint golden glow emanating from what appears to be a crevice in the mountainside. The wind howls with an almost sentient voice, sometimes whispering unintelligible phrases that dance at the edge of my consciousness.

Fighting against the biting cold that crystallizes my eyelashes and burns my lungs with each desperate breath, I make my way toward the mysterious light. The snow beneath my feet no longer feels like snow but something more substantial—like walking across clouds that have somehow solidified just enough to bear my weight.

As I reach the glowing crevice, I discover it's actually an ancient doorway carved with symbols that seem to shift and reorganize themselves when I try to focus on them. The moment my frost-bitten fingers touch the weathered surface, the mountain itself sighs, and the door dissolves into thousands of luminescent butterflies that swirl around me in a protective cyclone.

An elderly librarian with eyes that reflect entire galaxies approaches, but I notice his feet don't touch the ground—he's walking on the underside of a stream of liquid glass that flows through the chamber like a ribbon.
