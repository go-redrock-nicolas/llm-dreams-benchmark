I am dreaming. You reach out, brushing your fingertips against the smooth wooden handle of the paintbrush. The blank canvas before you hums with possibility, its surface pulsing in faint emerald light. In that instant you decide to summon the memory of the dawn before creation—an ocean of liquid gold spilling across an infinite sky. Your first stroke is a ribbon of molten sunrise arcing from one corner to the other. As the bristles glide, the air ripples: seconds stretch into hours, galaxies reel into view, and the distant echo of boiling stars whispers through your ears.

Emboldened, you dip the brush into a pool of cerulean time. On the canvas it blooms into a constellation of suspended moments—children chasing fireflies in a meadow that exists only at the edge of tomorrow, ancient ruins rising and falling in the same breath, and the ghost of your own laughter drifting like motes of light. Each line you draw rearranges the laws of reality; space folds into itself at the tip of the brush, and you feel history’s pulse beating under your skin. A smoky violet swirl appears at the center, a vortex that seems to inhale past and future alike, then exhales a thousand untold stories.

With a trembling hand, you add one final stroke: a tiny, trembling flame of pure white imagination. It blossoms into a portal so vivid you can almost step through it. The canvas tilts forward, and you cross the threshold. On the other side, time stands still yet races forward in every direction: you see your oldest self and your smallest self, laughing together on a floating island of lanterns. You hear the call of worlds long extinguished and glimpse newborn suns bursting into being. And there—just beyond your reach—a mirror of paint reflects you back, brush in hand, grinning with the joy of boundless creation.

As consciousness slips back and forth between dream and wakefulness, the painted sunrise on the canvas continues to glow. You realize that with each future stroke, you can shape not only art but the very tapestry of existence. The brush trembles with possibility in your grasp, and somewhere between heartbeats you decide to paint one more line—one that will bind past, present, and future into a single, radiant moment of forever.
