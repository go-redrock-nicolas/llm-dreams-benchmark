I am dreaming. I am lying in a bed made of liquid sunlight, glowing with a warm golden hue. The sheets shimmer like liquid metal and shift from solid to semi-transparent as I move across them. I become aware of an extraordinary ability— I can alter the atomic structure of the world around me with my thoughts. This power is exhilarating but also a little terrifying.

I decide to begin my experiments with a nearby water droplet suspended in the air.  I focus my mind, and in moments, it turns into a perfect diamond gemstone. The droplet hardens, crystallizing into a brilliant, multifaceted gem that sparkles with internal fire. I pick it up, marveling at its weight and beauty, only to dissolve it again into mist with a flick of my consciousness. The mist rises and then coalesces into a tiny bird— a phoenix, wings beating rapidly. The phoenix soars upward through the ceiling of my bedchamber, which flows aside like oil on water, and into an indigo sky streaked with swirling auroras.

Exploring further, I stand and walk out of my room into a landscape that defies logic. Trees with bark like polished marble tower above me, their leaves made of liquid mercury that drips downward in slow motion. The ground underfoot is an elastic membrane, springing back after each step like a living trampoline. I concentrate and command a stretch of it to become glass. It hardens instantly, revealing a kaleidoscopic view of an alien world below—crystal forests and luminous creatures darting through canyons of glowing violet rock.

The sky shifts continuously—sometimes it's a nebula alive with swirling colors; other times it's a gridwork of glowing equations that pulse like heartbeats. I create a column of pure energy—a helix of spiraling particles—to levitate myself upwards. As I ascend, the air around me becomes a soup of stardust, each mote shining like a captured supernova. I pass through rings of orbiting geometrical shapes: tetrahedrons, dodecahedrons, all humming in harmonic tones. 

In the distance, a mountain made entirely of frozen sound waves rises. Its peaks are sharp as diamond blades, and the slopes ripple like liquid when viewed sideways. When I touch it, vibrations travel through my body, each a memory I’ve never lived. 

I return to the glass viewing-platform and order it to transform into a bridge of solid light. It spans a chasm to an island floating in mid-air where a lake of liquid opal awaits. The surface reflects not my image, but possible futures—brief flashes of me sculpting continents or conversing with beings made of pure energy. 

But with the expanse of possibility comes an ache—this power is a echo of infinite potential. I clutch my head, feeling the weight of creation and destruction entwined. The landscape shudders momentarily before stabilizing when I calm my breath. 

I land on the opaline shore and kneel, letting my hands dip into the fluid gemstone. I mold it into a small sculpture—a representation of myself, cradling the universe in my dream-hands. As I finish, the figure winks out of existence, and I awake with a start, half-convinced I can still feel the faint warmth of stardust on my skin.
