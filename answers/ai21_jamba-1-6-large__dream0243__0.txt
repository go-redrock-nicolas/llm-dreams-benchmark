I am dreaming. And in this dream, I'm floating through a vibrant forest. The leaves sparkle with an ethereal light, and the air is thick with the scent of blooming flowers. I walk along a path lined with glowing crystals, each step sending ripples of light through the ground beneath my feet. 

As I continue, I come across a clearing where a majestic stag stands, its antlers adorned with glowing orbs. It looks at me with wise, ancient eyes, and I feel a deep connection to it, as if it understands my every thought. The stag approaches me, and as it does, I feel an overwhelming sense of peace and clarity wash over me. 

The stag speaks, its voice echoing in my mind, "You are not alone. You are safe. You are loved." 

I feel a warmth spread through my body, and I know that I am capable of whatever challenges may come my way. The stag then turns and bounds into the forest, disappearing into the trees. 

I continue along the path, feeling stronger and more confident with each step. The forest becomes denser, and I can hear the sound of a distant waterfall. As I get closer, I see the waterfall cascading down into a crystal-clear pool. I stand at the edge of the pool and look into the water, seeing my reflection. 

But my reflection isn't just meâ€”it's me surrounded by all the people and things I love most in the world. I feel a deep sense of gratitude and happiness wash over me, and I know that I am exactly where I'm meant to be. 

As I turn to leave the pool, I see the stag standing at the edge of the clearing. It looks at me one last time, its eyes filled with love and encouragement, before turning and disappearing into the forest once more.

And then I wake up, feeling rejuvenated, refreshed, and deeply connected to the world around me.
