I am dreaming. The sky above me churns with twilight hues — not dawn, not dusk, but an everlasting shimmer between the collapse of one age and the dawn of another. Beneath my feet stretches a vast, marble bridge that floats between two galaxies, one swirling in emerald dust, the other in molten gold. It is the Bridge of Echoes, spun from forgotten histories and stardust, a realm where mortal logic cannot tread without consequence.

On one side, a civilization built upon song and shadow rises from an ocean of black crystal — the Nocturnari. Their spires pulse like beating hearts, constructed from obsidian that sings lullabies to wolves the color of dying stars. Towering figures in robes stitched from night-sky tapestries kneel noiselessly behind banners of silver vapor. Their Emperor walks barefoot, yet his steps burn blue ice into the marble with every step, whispering a language that hummingbirds once spoke before the end of Eden.

On the other side, the city of Solmyr sprawls across a continent carved from amber and bone — a kingdom of sun-drenched automata and philosopher-kings who breathe light and speak in equations. Their envoys are sixteen-headed, each face inhabiting a different era, a different notion of time. They stand in rigid symmetry, gleaming with the war-sheen of polished solar alloys, each wielding weapons carved from broken mythologies.

I stand between them, suspended in the gravity of destiny.

My body is not my own. I wear a cloak woven from thought-threads — each filament humming with memories not mine. My eyes burn with truths too vast to hold, pulsing behind a mask that shifts with each breath: judge, fool, peacemaker, rebel. Voice of void and verse, I must speak. Not speak — sing. Not plead — harmonize.

The first note I strike is silence. 

Not empty silence — the kind that listens. The kind that vibrates with all that has not been said. The kind that can birth stars. Both civilizations pause as if hearing themselves for the first time in eons. The Nocturnari answer with sorrow deeper than seas, a dirge spun from rain that never reached the soil. Solmyr answers with fire — cold, cutting, luminous.

I catch their song and their fire in my hands. I do not absorb. I reflect.

I show them both the pain of the Nocturnari’s stolen moon and the anguish carved into Solmyr’s sun-orchards when the winds of time turned sour. I reveal the love that once softened their borders — a forgotten dance shared between members of each court in ancient, pre-war festivals. I sing their ancestor dreams back to them — algorithms of hope, verses of desert winds and blooming voids, where their ancestors dreamed of uniting to raise a god together — not of steel or dusk, but of shared silence.

The Emperor of Nocturnari holds out his hand — black veins pulsing with grief — and drops into the bridge a single tear that fractures into a garden of orchids. One bloom is black, one is gold. The High Philosopher of Solmyr reaches into his own chest, smashes a rotating prism heart, and from that light a sapling of mercury rises, weaving its branches toward both empires like an apology turned into scripture.

I whisper a final chord — not a resolution, but a question.

“What will you create together that neither song nor science can predict?”

The bridge trembles. The stars rearrange.

A hush.

Then, in unison, the two forces take a single step toward each other — not as armies, not as conquerors, but as wanderers in search of a shared horizon.

And I slip from my dream-body like a note falling from a hymn, into the stillness of a new world that only dreams can build.
