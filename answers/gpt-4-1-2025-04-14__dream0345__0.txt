I am dreaming. I am nestled within the velvet folds of a dream, where the air hums with colors unseen in waking life—vivid indigos swirl with lush emerald and electric gold, crackling at the edges of my perception. In this land of wonder, reality ebbs and flows like tides beneath a violet moon.  

Through the mist, I see my close friend, but they are not quite themselves. Their laughter—which used to ring like chimes in a summer breeze—now echoes hollow, edged with a brittle sharpness. Their eyes, usually alight with sparks of mischief, flicker and dart as though shadowed by worlds I cannot see. Their footsteps, once confident and bold, now hesitate over cracks invisible to anyone else.

We drift together down a winding lane that stretches on into the unknown, lined with trees whose branches arch overhead, heavy with lanterns glowing with memories: our first adventures, the warmth of secret-shared smiles, wild midnights filled with dreams and plans.

I reach out—not with words, but with the gentle touch of presence. In this world, conversation flows beneath the surface; questions tug at the edges of my thoughts, and understanding pours forth in colors and sensations.  
I send a cascade of golden warmth towards them, concern shimmering in azure waves. My friend recoils at first, shrouded in a cloak of shadow, but as I persist, the shadow becomes translucent, revealing glimpses of their inner struggle: tangled threads of worry, dissonant notes of pain.

I do not push. I walk alongside them, patient as the moon. I offer a glimmering orb of acceptance, shining with quiet invitation: “When you are ready. When you wish. I will walk with you. You are not alone.”  

For a moment, the path brightens; a few lanterns pulse gently, as if in encouragement. My friend’s shoulders loosen ever so slightly; a single smile, fragile as spun glass, flickers across their lips.

In this dreamscape, I learn the art of compassionate presence—of listening not just with ears, but with soul. Of letting silence be a sanctuary, and letting hope be the thread that sews new strength into the fabric of friendship.

We continue through the mist, side by side, moving towards the place where dawn gilds the tips of the tallest trees, and the promise of healing hangs like dew in the morning light.
