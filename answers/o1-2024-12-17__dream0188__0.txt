I am dreaming. You are dreaming…

You awaken inside a vast, circular hall whose ceiling spirals upward in glimmering fractals of glass and starlight. The air around you has the slightly sweet scent of exotic flowers. Three tables are arranged in a triangle, each one bathed in a different hue: one is lit by a warm, amber glow; another glimmers with a blue luminescence; and the third radiates a soft, rose-pink light.

Upon the first table—under the amber glow—lies a blank canvas twice as tall as you. The brushes, jars of paint, tubes of thick oils, and feathery pastels are neatly placed in a semicircle. It’s the corner where unbridled imagination calls to you, urging your artistic creativity to burst forth.

At the second table—swathed in forget-me-not blue—piles of notes and a crystal tablet display equations and logical puzzles, some shifting in the air as though scrawled on invisible chalkboards. Symbols rearrange themselves the moment you glance away, challenging you to untangle their meaning and solution through disciplined logical analysis.

At the third table—glowing pink like dawn’s first light—buckles, ribbons, letters sealed with wax, and small heart-shaped tokens beckon the tenderness of your emotional intelligence. It reminds you of vulnerability and connection—the intangible wisdom you gain through empathy, sincerity, and love.

You have no conscious memory of how you arrived in this hall, but a voice—soft as a summer breeze—echoes within your mind: You must engage all three tasks in perfect harmony.

You notice the brush handle in your hand is warm, humming with untapped energy. One moment you’re dripping vivid lavender paint onto the blank canvas, letting it cascade in swirling loops, creating an image of some half-imagined, celestial bird with wings that stretch into the cosmos. Your fingers dance across the canvas, blending blues and golds until the bird nearly quivers with life against the background.

Just as the final feather takes shape under your brush, you feel a sudden shift. You’re pulled from the canvas to the second table, where your vision snaps to strict lines and crisp angles. Gone is the chaotic splendor of paint. Instead, forms take shape in your mind—a labyrinth of puzzles and numeric patterns. Equations rattle in a code you recognize only by logic:

1, 2, 4, 7, 11, ?

A sequence that demands the next number, geometry that needs designing. You race to unmask the logic, scrawling lines on turquoise parchment that softly glows. Your heartbeat quickens in excitement each time you solve a piece of the puzzle. Symbols shift again, forming a triangle connected by lines of radiant, moving text. You swiftly piece it together, each step orchestrating a mental ballet of reason. A sudden jolt of satisfaction lights up your mind when you arrive at the solution.

Before you can celebrate, you feel another pull—this time, the air grows gentler and the blue luminescence recedes. You turn to the pink-tinted table, where delicate letters with unbroken seals lie in a snug little nest. Their wax stamps shimmer with subtle color changes—are they reflecting your emotions, or reading them? You press one friendly letter to your chest, as if cradling a sleeping bird.

As you break the wax seal, a faint music swirls around you. It’s a tune that stirs your empathy, each note evoking a hidden emotion. Through the letter’s whispered words, you intuit an unspoken meaning: the writer is reaching out, longing for understanding, compassion, and acceptance. With each sentence you read, warmth expands in your chest, a comforting presence urging you toward kindness and sensitivity.

Though you want to linger on the gentle hum of empathy, your vision flickers once more, drawing you back to the first table. This time you see your painting incomplete—one side of the wing is half-finished. Grabbing a palette knife, you blend a swirl of scarlet and copper across the canvas, capturing a fiery, beating heart within the center of the cosmic bird. The colors pulse with life, fueled by the emotional residue of the letter. With each brushstroke, the creature becomes more vibrant, as though sustaining itself from your empathic revelation.

Moments later, you hear a bright ping—a crystalline chime that dissolves into a pattern of numbers. Your mind leaps back to the puzzle-laden table in the blink of an eye. Now the equations seem to dance in synergy with the swirling forms of your painting. It’s as if the mathematics themselves have become a living, flickering presence, each number reflecting the flashes of color still lingering in your imagination. You deftly manipulate the puzzle’s final pieces, almost hearing the cosmic bird’s call urging you to solve it, to push reason to its apex.

And then, that gentle pink light washes over you again, guiding you back to the third table as you slip into a moment of deep introspection. You become aware of your own emotional current coursing through the dreamworld. The letters on this table speak not only of others’ feelings but also mirror your hidden hopes and wants. Serenely, you place your hands on your heart, letting the swirl of compassion, creativity, and logic merge into a single current of energy.

––––––––––

In one seamless flow, you drift between all three tables—painting in luminous arcs that whisper mathematics, forging equations that ring with empathy, and opening your heart to give imaginative form to feeling. Each table’s light melds into the next, enveloping you in a triad of energies: the brilliance of creation, the clarity of thought, and the warmth of genuine emotion. 

Finally, you sense a gentle weight on your shoulders. Looking up, you see the cosmic bird you painted, shimmering into real existence. It rests, luminous and alive, its plumage a tapestry of color, formula, and compassion. Its wings enfold you, blending the hall’s tri-colored glow into a single beam of pure light. There’s an understanding that you’ve achieved balance—no single aspect overshadowing another, all three in glorious concert.

Then you blink, and the spiral ceiling blurs. Everything dissolves into white and gold luminescence, as if you are being lifted out of the dream’s tapestry. The last thing you see before you awaken is the cosmic bird, gazing at you with eyes brimming with infinite wonder. Its call echoes through the ether:

Create. Know. Feel.

And with that resounding anthem, you gently awaken… remembering the luscious dream and the revelation of unity that lingers in your heart.
