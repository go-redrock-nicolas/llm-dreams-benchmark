I am dreaming. I can hear the wind howling past as it buffets the body of our proud ship.  I can feel the deck rolling and pitching beneath my feet.  

I am the captain of this vessel, and my crew are looking nervously to me for guidance.  They need me to keep a steady hand and a level head.  They need me to look past the fury of the storm and steer us true.

The waves are monstrous, their peaks rising well above the railings of the deck.  At times, they tower over us, dark walls of water crested with white foam.  Other times the ship shudders as the belly of a wave slams into us.

Lightning flashes constantly, lighting the clouds from within, giving everything a strange, ethereal, strobe-like quality.  The deep bass rumble of thunder is ever-present, but it does not trouble me.  I know this storm is not the wrath of a god, merely the fury of nature.

The rain is falling in sheets, plastering my clothes to my body and sending rivulets of water streaming from my hair and into my eyes.  But still I stand on the deck, a hand upon the wheel, my gaze fixed into the dark heart of the storm.  My only concession to the weather is my lawn sleeves, which I have pulled over my head in an attempt to keep the rain from my eyes.

I know I must remain calm, for my crew is very afraid.  They have never weathered a storm like this, and doubtless the fury of the storm fills them with dread.  I have seen it in their eyes, the fear that they may never see their loved ones again.  But I see it too in their posture, the way they flinch from the lightning and thunder, the way they stand hunched against the wind and the rain.  Some of them huddle together, clutching at the railing with white-knuckled hands.

But they need me to be strong.  They need me to show them that we will survive this, that all will be well.  And so I do not allow myself the luxury of fear.  I do not show it in my eyes, or in my face, or in my stance.  I stand tall and strong, the ship's wheel firm in my grip.

I will steer us through this, and we will emerge stronger for it.  I know this as surely as I know my own name.  I know this as surely as I know the sea.  We will survive.  We must.  There is simply no other option.
