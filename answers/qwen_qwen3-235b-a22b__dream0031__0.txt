I am dreaming. I am pressed into a crowded subway train, the heat of bodies pressing in around me, exhaling into the thick, electric air. The familiar clatter of steel wheels on steel track fills the car like a monotonous lullaby. A woman in a red scarf whispers into her phone in a language I don’t recognize. A boy eats from a greasy paper bag, scattering crumbs onto the floor where pigeons do not yet coo. A man with eyes like shattered glass stares straight ahead and hums something tuneless, like a broken music box.

Then—without warning—the **lights go out**.

The overhead fluorescents wink off all at once, dropping the cabin into inky darkness. A collective inhale fills the void, followed by silence.

Then the train **screeches** to a halt. Not gently. Not safely. With a violent lurch that throws people forward like ragdolls in a child’s tantrum. A baby wails. Someone screams. The emergency lights—yellow, dim, flickering—try and fail to come on. The only illumination is the eerie, ghostly glow leaking from cracked smartphone screens and the red blinking of an emergency panel that flashes: **UNDEFINED ERROR**.

Something is wrong.

Beyond the windows—what little you can see through the grime—is not stone and steel tunnel walls, but a yawning blackness, like someone has peeled away reality and exposed the bones of a forgotten world. The train sits suspended in a void, as though time itself has forgotten this place.

Breathing becomes difficult. Not from the heat anymore—from something else. Something thick in the air. A sweet, metallic scent. Like burnt sugar and rusted iron.

A child’s voice echoes through the tunnel, though no child is visible.

"**Don’t move,**" it whispers in that dream-child voice—too polite, too knowing. "**The Engineer is walking the tracks.**"

Shadows beyond the train begin to **shift**. They stretch like smoke on a breeze, curling along the tunnel walls, whispering among themselves in a thousand languages you never learned but somehow understand: *Catacomb. Prison. Memory vault.* The darkness breathes.

The passengers grow strangely quiet. One by one, lights from their phones begin to fail. Some vanish like blown candles. Others go out with a wet, organic sound, as if smothered by something unseen.

Then there’s a **noise on the tracks**—like footsteps, slow, deliberate—each one reverberating through the subway car like a drumbeat heard inside a skull. The **Engineer**. The walls begin to bleed soft ochre light, as though the tunnel itself is remembering the sun.

From the tunnel, **it** emerges.

It wears a trench coat made of cables and stitching. Rivets line its arms like medals. Its face—where there should be one—is a scattering of brass gears, turning soundlessly, revealing flickers of a face that keeps changing: old woman, young man, child, old man. A mask that is not a mask.

It carries in its hand a lantern made of **pale bone**, and light flickers faintly in its depths.

Then it **looks at me**, and I feel something terrifying:

**It already knows me.**

It opens its mouth—a door in the air that leads somewhere impossible—and speaks, not in words, but in music played by broken wind instruments, and I understand still.

"You have dreamed too far," it says. “This is **the Forgotten Line**. No one rides here twice.”

Behind me, the train doors shoot open of their own accord, though I feel no air, no rush. Looking back, I see not the next station—but a city sprawled in the blackness below, built of rust, glass eyes, and glowing veins of jellyfish. Towers shaped like teeth. Clocks tuck tucked into ribcages. People in the tendrils of the city float gently in the void like jellyfish on an eternal tide.

“You must choose,” the Engineer says. “Return to the dream... or settle in the city beneath forgetting.”

And the people around me—were they always statues? Are they dreams themselves, still dreaming?

I realize then—this is a **limbus**, where lost stories go to sleep. Where **abandoned thoughts** grow legs and walk the tunnels, and where people wake into myths they never meant to become.

And I, still tethered to waking, feel the cold edge of a final choice hover over my heart.

Dream, or become the dreamer without a name.  

I choose—

(But dreams do not wait for finishing)
