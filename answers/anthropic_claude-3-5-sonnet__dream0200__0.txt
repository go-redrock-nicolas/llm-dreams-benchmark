I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a vast, iridescent library that seems to extend infinitely in all directions, even upward into a crystalline dome that reflects countless shifting colors. The bookshelves are impossibly tall, crafted from what appears to be living wood that pulses with a gentle, amber luminescence. Each book on these shelves contains not just words, but entire worlds – I can see them shimmer and move beneath their covers like living things.

As I walk forward, my footsteps echo on floors that transition between translucent crystal and pools of liquid knowledge that ripple with every step, yet somehow keep me suspended above them. I realize with mounting excitement and terror that I'm here to accomplish what I've spent eternities preparing for: I must find and read the single book that contains the sum of all human understanding and consciousness, then somehow share it with every mind that exists or will ever exist.

The bookshelves bend and flex like waves on an ocean, books flying between them in complex patterns that remind me of murmurations of starlings. I realize that the library itself is alive, conscious, and it's testing me. Every movement I make must be perfect, every choice precisely calculated, as if I'm performing an elaborate dance with reality itself.

My fingertips are mere inches from the glowing book when suddenly...
