I am dreaming. Darkness dissolves into light as I find myself ascending marble steps toward an imposing courthouse. The building seems impossibly tall, its spire piercing through swirling, iridescent clouds that shift between crimson and gold. The weight of my robes grows heavier with each step, black fabric that occasionally ripples with threads of silver that move like mercury when I'm not looking directly at them.

Inside the courtroom, the ceiling stretches upward into infinity, columns spiraling impossibly. The gallery is filled with observers whose faces continually shift and blur—sometimes I recognize them as family members, sometimes as strangers with eyes that glow like embers. Their whispers create a sound like rustling autumn leaves.

Before me stands the defendant, a figure who keeps changing form—sometimes appearing as a corporate titan in an immaculate suit, sometimes as a politician with a practiced smile, sometimes as a shadow with gleaming teeth. The evidence files on my bench periodically rearrange themselves when I look away, the text swimming and reforming.

Anonymous notes appear under my chamber door each morning—some containing thinly veiled threats, others offering wealth beyond imagination. My phone rings at precisely 3:17 AM each night, but there's only the sound of waves crashing when I answer.

As the trial progresses, I notice strange men in identical gray suits watching my home from a black car with windows that reflect nothing. My food tastes increasingly metallic. The courthouse corridors grow longer each day, and I sometimes pass alternate versions of myself walking in the opposite direction, their eyes downcast, their decisions already made.

The night before the verdict, the sky outside my window pulses with silent lightning, and I realize with crystalline clarity that this case is about something far greater than what appears in the official records—it's about the very nature of truth and consequence, about whether justice can exist in a world where reality itself seems negotiable.

I awaken at my bench to deliver the verdict, the words forming in my mind with perfect clarity, even as the courtroom begins to dissolve around me...
