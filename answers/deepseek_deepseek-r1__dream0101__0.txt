I am dreaming. The air thrums with an electric chill, metallic and sharp against your skin, as you blink into the harsh cerulean glow of the ship’s bridge. Panels pulse crimson, symbols you don’t recognize—angular, alive, almost *hissing*—swarm across screens like predatory glyphs. Your crew isn’t human. Tall, iridescent figures with limbs like liquid mercury turn to you, their faces shifting mosaics of starlight. One steps forward, emitting a sound like fractured glass harmonizing. You don’t understand… until you *do*. The translation implants in your skull buzz: **“Core breach in 17 minutes. The Void is awake.”**  

Your boots magnetize to the floor as you stumble toward the viewport. Outside, space isn’t black. It’s *bruised*—swirls of violet and gold, a nebula shuddering as if clawed by invisible talons. The ship—*your ship*—is organic, its walls veined with bioluminescent tendrils that recoil from your touch. A console detaches, slithering toward you like a serpent of light. It molds into a helm, and your hands move instinctively, inputting codes your mind doesn’t know.  

Alarms shriek. A crewmember dissolves into a cascade of silver particles, screaming in a language that melts into piano notes. The floor liquefies, and you’re falling—not down, but *sideways*—through a labyrinth of inverted gravity. You land in Engineering, where the core isn’t machinery. It’s a pulsing heart, encased in fractal crystal, cracked and oozing black ichor that writhes like sentient smoke. A voice, neither male nor female, vibrates in your bones: **“You forgot the song. Sing it, or we become the Void’s marrow.”**  

Your throat burns. A melody rises, unbidden—a lullaby from a childhood you’re not sure was ever yours. The ichor stills. The crystal mends. But the crew’s eyes now reflect your face back at you, twisted, older, galactic storms swirling in your irises. You wake again—*truly* wake—in a pod, planetside, your breath fogging glass as an alien sun rises… twin, weeping, and green.  

The dream lingers. Your palms still hum with the song.
