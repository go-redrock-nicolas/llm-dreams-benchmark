I am dreaming. The tides of REM have taken me to a rich landscape that defies conventional physics and ignites my imagination.

As my dream self becomes aware of my surroundings, a realization begins to dawn in my mind. Scenes from the life I know replay, and I suddenly understand that I have been operating a mindset of scarcity. A voice, seemingly ethereal, whispers to my dreaming self, “You have been living based on the belief that resources are limited, and fear has been the guiding principle of your existence. But, it's time for change.”

The scenery of my dream shifts, like a kaleidoscope spinning and reorganizing the reality I thought I knew. Gone is the familiar world. I'm transported to an open golden savannah sprawling endlessly under a cerulean blue sky. The air is almost tangible, pregnant with the scent of wildflowers and the earthy tang of damp soil.

A warm breeze brushes my skin, soothing me, as the ethereal voice continues, “In the realm of dreams, abundance is the unwritten law. Like a once dormant seed, an abundance mindset begins to sprout, nurture it and the fruits will transform your wakeful world.”

Suddenly, a potent feeling of gratitude floods me, washing away the stubborn residues of fear and worry linked to my once-upon-a-time scarcity mindset. In this newfound state of plenty, my imagination paints rich details on the canvas of my dream world.

Lush greenery and vibrant blooms crown the landscape, a rich metaphor for my budding abundance mindset. The sky above, a pure, limitless blue, becomes a mirror to the untapped potential within my own self. A herd of migrating wildebeests traverses the savannah without a worry for tomorrow, teaching me that even wildlife operates on the innate understanding that nature is bountiful.

As the dream continues to unfold, I become a spectator to my wakeful self, witnessing small changes multiply into a harmony of sufficiency and generosity. The more I give, the more I mysteriously seem to possess. As my selfless contributions to others grow, so too does the fulfillment I experience. 

Giving love, kindness, compassion, or even a simple smile, I am participating in the grand dance of abundance. With everything I need available in plentiful amounts, I have more to offer, making the world I know a paradise of plenitude.

As the first light of morning begins to bring me back to my conscious existence, I am left with one last lesson from the dreamscape. The universe is an abundant place, and adopting a mindset that acknowledges this bounty allows us to partake freely in the endless dividends of generosity, success, and joy.

Awakening with exhilaration, my heart swells with gratitude. The universe has whispered its secret, and I am determined to carry its wisdom into my waking life.

I am dreaming no more. The reverie has lifted, but its abundance remains. In the wake of such vivid imagery and potent realizations, I am reborn, ready to face life with a refreshed, abundant mindset.
