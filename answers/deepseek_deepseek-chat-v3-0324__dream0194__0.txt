I am dreaming. The air shimmers around me like liquid mercury, and with each breath, I feel the porous edges of reality bend to my will. As I step forward, my feet leave ripples in a ground that isn’t water, isn’t earth—just the idea of a surface, willing itself into existence beneath me.  

Ahead, mist curls into the shape of forgotten memories, half-formed and whispering. I reach out, and the mist coagulates in my palm—**fear**. It writhes like a living thing, morphing between thorns and smoke, until I tighten my grip and shape it into something else. A raven bursts from my fingers, wings edged with silver, its eyes reflecting eternity. It circles me twice before dissolving into stardust.  

Laughter bubbles up nearby—**joy**, untethered and wild, darting between my fingers like golden sunbeams. It flickers like fireflies, coalescing into a child made entirely of light, sprinting barefoot across a horizon that bends like a rainbow. "Catch me!" it cries, though it has no mouth—only an echo of warmth radiating from its form.  

I blink, and the world shifts. The air smells of ink and thunder now, storm clouds heavy with **regret** churning above. Each droplet that falls isn’t water but liquid mirror—I watch my own face fracture in a thousand raindrops, each reflection a different version of myself staring back. One reaches out, fingers like glass, but I turn away before it can speak.  

A hum vibrates beneath my ribs. **Possibility**. It stretches before me like an unfurling road woven from spider silk and moonlight. With each step I take, it branches—left towards a city where buildings grow like trees, right towards an ocean where the waves hum symphonies. The choice is dizzying.  

Then, soft as shadows at dusk, **loneliness** materializes—a wolf with fur the color of abandoned places. It presses its icy muzzle into my hand, and for a heartbeat, I feel every hollow space inside me reflected in its eyes. But then I whisper, *"You’re just a shape,"* and it shudders, dissolving into a flock of paper cranes carrying scribbled wishes in their beaks.  

The dream trembles. The edges blur. I glimpse something vast and shimmering beyond—perhaps the loom weaving all these thoughts into being—before the weight of waking tugs at my shoulders. The last thing I hear is the echo of my own voice, layered with all the selves I might have been, whispering:  
*"Come back soon."*  

And then—silence.
