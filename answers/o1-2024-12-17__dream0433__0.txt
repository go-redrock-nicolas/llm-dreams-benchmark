I am dreaming. You drift into slumber, and the world around you dissolves into a swirling tapestry of color and sound. As the dream world settles, you find yourself standing on a grand marble terrace high above a kaleidoscopic city. The sky overhead is dusky violet, speckled with radiant stars that seem almost close enough to reach out and pluck. Warm wind rustles through your hair. The city below is alive with towers of prism-like crystal that catch the starlight, refracting it into dazzling rainbows dancing across the cobblestone streets.

Figures move about in the streets—some luminous and soft, others tall and angular in silhouette. Each appears focused on their own pursuits: one figure conjures ribbons of light from their fingertips, painting the air with shimmering patterns; another kneels by a fountain that glows with turquoise water, cupping it in their hands and letting it slip through their fingers like silk. An undercurrent of whispered chanting travels on the warm breeze, weaving a gentle, entrancing melody.

Suddenly, your attention is drawn to a group of figures assembling at the foot of your marble terrace. Their voices are rising in frustrated conversation, each blaming the others for the same fault: a stinging self-importance or arrogance that makes them each want to stand out. The more they accuse, the more agitated you feel, as if their accusations are aimed directly at you, even when they barely glance your way. You’ve known this feeling before—intense judgment, pulsing in your mind. Like a mirror turned outward, you spot in them the very trait that secretly unsettles you in yourself. The tension tightens your chest, and you feel a flash of haughty indignation. Why do they act so self-important?

In a moment of heightened clarity, you realize the dream has given form to your hidden insecurities. You remember that this pattern of projection—a tendency to reject in others what you dislike most in yourself—can keep you stuck in a cycle of resentment and denial. As soon as you grasp this understanding, the quarrelsome group shimmers and shifts. They dissolve like desert mirages, fading into spirals of gold dust on the breeze. The heat of your anger cools, and in its place, a gentle compassion begins to bloom in your chest.

You descend the marble staircase and step onto the city’s main thoroughfare. Everywhere you look, people continue about their fantastic routines, but now they appear like graceful dancers in a cosmic ballet. An air of possibility envelops you. You sense that by turning inward—by recognizing and healing your own disparaging feelings about self-importance—you will approach others with deeper empathy. In this softening realization, your surroundings lighten like dawn pushing away night’s darkness. The crystal spires become more vibrant, the turquoise fountains sparkle, and the rainbow beams refract more brilliantly than before.

Facing a polished crystal mirror that stands among the buildings, you gaze into your reflection. It’s luminous, shimmering, yet utterly human. The trait that once triggered your judgment feels gentler, easier to hold. In acknowledging it, you feel a wave of acceptance course through your dreaming body. As you breathe deeply, the entire city hums with a shared sigh of relief.

Then, slowly, the mirror’s surface ripples and the vision begins to blur. You hover on the threshold between dream and wakefulness, carrying with you a peaceful resolve—the knowledge that what we sometimes reject in others is often our own unloved shadow, longing to be recognized. And as you slip toward wakefulness, you bring back that gentle revelation, knowing that understanding ourselves is the key to seeing everyone else with kinder, more compassionate eyes.
