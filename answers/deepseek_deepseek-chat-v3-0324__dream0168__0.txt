I am dreaming. The air is thick with static, the radio crackling with frantic voices cutting in and out—fragments of desperation tangled in electronic distortion. My command center is a storm of flickering monitors, holographic maps glitching in and out of existence, their glow casting eerie reflections on the sweat-damp faces around me. Outside, the sky is an unnatural bruise of purple and black, split by jagged lightning that doesn’t fade, hanging like fractured glass in the air.  

Disasters unfold in cascading chaos—each one more surreal than the last. To the west, a wildfire races across the city, but the flames burn cold, turning skyscrapers into brittle sculptures of blue ice that shatter with hollow, crystalline screams. To the east, floodwaters rise, but they defy gravity, flowing upward, swallowing helicopters whole as rescue teams scream over the radio before their voices dissolve into eerie silence. The earth trembles beneath us, but instead of splitting open, it *breathes*—the ground undulating like a living thing, swallowing entire neighborhoods in slow, rhythmic pulses.  

Every decision is a gamble. Do I divert the last remaining drones to the hospital rooftop, where doctors signal frantically as the rising water laps at their feet? Or send them to the subway tunnels, where survivors are trapped between walls that ripple like liquid metal? I reach for the comms again, but the system *laughs* at me—a distorted, glitching noise that stutters through the speakers like a broken record of a child’s giggle. The faces on the screens flicker, twisting into grotesque, elongated masks before resetting.  

A technician beside me whispers, "The disasters aren’t real.”  
I turn. Their eyes are black voids, their smile too wide. “Or maybe *we* aren’t.”  

The ground heaves. The ceiling splits. And as the command center collapses into the hungry earth, the last thing I hear is my own voice on the radio, screaming instructions—to myself.  

Then, silence.  

I wake up.   

The taste of copper lingers. My fingers clutch crumpled sheets. Somewhere, in the half-light of dawn, a phone rings. It doesn’t stop.  

I answer.  

Static. Then—*laughter.*
