I am dreaming. I find myself repeatingly drawn to explore the deeper meaning behind ordinary experiences. Following this philosophical inclination, 
I start my journey by entering into a beautiful forest full of colorful flowers and singing birds. As soon as I step inside, I feel like I'm in another world entirely. 

The air smells sweet and fresh, while the sound of running water fills up my ears. I walk slowly towards a small creek that flows through this place. I dip my hand into its cool waters and splash some on my face. It feels refreshing and soothing. 

I sit down beside the creek and watch the water flow past me. I notice how each drop of water has its own unique shape, size, speed, direction, color, sound, temperature... everything that makes up reality for us humans. Yet at the same time, they all merge together into one continuous stream that carries life force from source to destination. 

I wonder what this means. Why do we exist? What purpose do we serve? How does our existence relate to the universe as a whole? These questions haunt me day and night. They make me feel lost and alone in this dark abyss called space where no one can see or hear me except for myself.
