I am dreaming. **Dream Journal: The Symphony of Chaos**  

I am standing in the heart of a colossal, cavernous hall—a cathedral of impossibility, with ceilings so high they dissolve into swirling mist. Chandeliers, crystalline and humming with an ethereal glow, float untethered above, casting prismatic light across the walls, which seem to breathe, pulsating softly like the ribs of a living beast. This is the Event. And it must be perfect.  

The air thrums with urgency. Delegates from realms unknown are coming—beings of shimmering shadow, liquid mercury faces shifting into expressions I can’t decipher, dignitaries with too many eyes and clockwork limbs. Their arrivals are marked not by footsteps, but by distortions in the air, ripples of reality bending to accommodate them. My role is unclear, yet absolute: **I must orchestrate this seamlessly, or something unspeakable will unravel.**

At first, the preparations seem effortless. Tables arrange themselves at my will, their surfaces morphing to accommodate the culinary whims of each guest—dishes that shift from roasted peacock to nebula soup between blinks. The centerpiece glows—a spire of frozen time, within which tiny galaxies spin lazily. The program scrolls in the air before me, elegant calligraphy rewriting itself as contingencies are accounted for.  

But then, the fraying begins.  

A table meant for the Lord of Hollows refuses to stay still—it flickers in and out of existence, leaving guests clutching at empty air. The ice sculptures, carved from the dreams of ancient gods, begin to *weep*, their melting slow but undeniable, each drip echoing like a mourning bell. The musicians—inhuman things with violins of silver bone—start playing a dissonant dirge, their strings snapping one by one with the sound of breaking threads of fate. And worst of all, the doors—the grand, onyx doors through which the most important guest, the Architect of Echoes, is meant to enter—will not *open.* No matter how I push, or plead, or command, they remain sealed, their surface now reflecting not my face, but a version of me that is *screaming.*  

The panic is a living thing, coiling around my ribs. The air thickens, the walls leaning in. The guests have stopped their mingling; now, they watch me with amusement, or pity, or hunger. Their murmured words slither into my ears: *"You were never meant to succeed. This was always the end."*  

And then—a hand on my shoulder. A whisper. **"The flaw was in the foundation."**  

I turn—but before I see who spoke, the dream fractures like glass, and I am falling—not down, but *sideways*, into the space between moments, where the truth of the Event waits, grinning and inevitable.  

Then—silence. 

I wake, gasping, the last words still echoing:  

**"The flaw was in the foundation."**  

*(And I know—somewhere, in some world, the Event is still unfolding. And it is already ruined.)*
