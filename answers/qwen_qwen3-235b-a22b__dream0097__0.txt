I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air tastes like burnt copper, sharp and electric, as if the sky itself has cracked open. You stand in the heart of a sprawling city square, its cobblestones shimmering under a bruised violet sky. A parade was underway—a riot of color, music, and laughter—until the earth shuddered. Once, twice. The ground splits like the skin of a ripe fruit, spewing geysers of molten light. Towers sway, their glass facades sloughing off like shed scales, and the crowd erupts into a symphony of screams. People scatter like marbles spilled from a jar, their shadows elongating into grotesque, flickering things.  

But then—*you feel it*. A pulse, low and resonant, thrumming in your molars. The chaos slows. Notices you. *You*.  

Your hands rise, trembling, and the world bends. The falling debris hovers midair, shards of glass and concrete trembling like fireflies in a storm. The screams mute into a hollow hum. Time unravels, threads of gold and obsidian spiraling around you, and you realize—*you can drink the disaster*. The energy, the terror, the raw, searing heat of destruction—it rushes into you, not as poison, but as nectar. Your veins blaze with stolen lightning.  

A fissure yawns open beneath a screaming child, swallowing the cobblestones whole. You leap—not run, but *leap*—and the air thickens under your feet like a trampoline of invisible force. You catch the child, their wide eyes reflecting the apocalypse, and set them gently atop a frozen fountain. The ground quakes again, but you press your palm to the earth, and it stills, whimpering like a chastened beast.  

Above, the sky bleeds. A jagged rift tears through the heavens, leaking tendrils of starlight that writhe like serpents. You reach for them, and they coil around your arms, cold and alive. With a scream that is not yours but the universe’s, you hurl the energy downward, sealing the wounds in the earth. The crowd freezes, their panic suspended in a fragile bubble, as you become something *other*—a silhouette glowing with stolen sunfire, a figure half-human, half-event.  

Then, as suddenly as it began, the dream fractures. The crowd dissolves into mist. The towers melt into a forest of bioluminescent trees. The child vanishes, leaving only a single black feather in your palm. The starlight tendrils retreat into the sky, now stitched shut. You stand alone, the disaster’s ghost lingering in your bones.  

You wake with the taste of ozone on your tongue—and the unshakable sense that the world, in all its violence and beauty, is waiting for you to notice it again.
