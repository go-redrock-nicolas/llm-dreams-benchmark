I am dreaming. You open your eyes to a village suspended above an endless lake, its wooden homes balanced on stilts like herons mid-step. The air hums with the scent of wet cedar and crushed elderflower, and bridges woven from braided moonlight connect each dwelling. This is Thistlemere, a place where every whisper ripples across the water, carrying generations of secrets in its wake.  

The villagers move with liquid grace, their eyes reflecting the aurora-streaked sky. You’re drawn to a communal firepit where smoke spirals into constellations, shaping stories older than the lake itself. A woman with hair like tangled kelp hands you a clay bowl of broth that tastes of nostalgia you’ve never lived—honeysuckle summers, frostbitten winters, the salt of lost voyages. “You’ll need your strength,” she murmurs, her voice a creaking dock. “The Weaving begins at moonrise.”  

But Thistlemere thrives on duality. Beneath the surface of shared harvests and harmonized lullabies simmers an intricate dance of alliances. The Elders’ Council, cloaked in iridescent fish scales, guard an ancient artifact—a moonstone said to pulse with the lake’s heartbeat. Yet the younger generation, faces painted with bioluminescent algae, whisper of a shadow collective called the Wavemakers, who navigate hidden currents beneath the stilts.  

Your test comes when you discover a silver key lodged in the ribs of a fossilized leviathan skeleton at the lakebed. It fits neither the Elders’ obsidian vault nor the Wavemakers’ submerged cipher-locks. Instead, it hums when held near the village’s central pillar, a spiraling monolith carved with the faces of those who vanished during last century’s Silent Tide.  

That night, the moonstone’s rhythm stutters. The lake writhes, birthing specters of fishermen swallowed by storms, children who followed will-o’-the-wisps into the mist. The Elders demand unity; the Wavemakers hiss of sacrifice. You stand at the pillar, key in hand, as the village fractures into flickering echoes—some urging you to dismantle the artifact, others to let the waves reclaim everything.  

A barn owl with a human tongue lands on your shoulder. “You are neither guest nor intruder,” it croons. “You’re the **hinge**.” The key grows molten, searing your palm with visions: the moonstone is a fossilized star, flawed, bleeding discord into the water. But destroying it would unravel Thistlemere’s fragile balance of memory and survival.  

As dawn bleeds into the dream, you realize the true ritual isn’t in choosing a side, but in merging them—letting the pillar drink your blood and the key, forging a third path etched in scars and starlight. The villagers’ eyes lock onto yours, waiting. But before you act, the edges of the world fray into mist, the choice suspended like a dewdrop on a spider’s web…  

You wake with the taste of elderflower and the phantom weight of the key, its truth dissolving like threads of a half-remembered song.
