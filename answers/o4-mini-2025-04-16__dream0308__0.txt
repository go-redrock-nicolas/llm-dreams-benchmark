I am dreaming. You find yourself drifting through a twilight tapestry of silk and concrete. The sky above shimmers with lantern fire—red orbs that pulse in time with your heartbeat. Each lantern bears an intricate emblem borrowed from your ancestors: a phoenix rising from lotus petals. Below, slick city streets glint with neon graffiti, their electric blues and pinks rippling like restless water. You hover between these two realms, as if caught on a suspended bridge sewn from moonlight and memory.  

A warm breeze carries the scent of sandalwood and jasmine from the temple gates at your left. There, a row of lacquered pillars stands guard, each carved with the wisdom of grandparents who spoke in proverbs. Their voices echo in your mind: “Honor the river that feeds your roots.” You step forward in bare feet—the ground beneath you alternates between cold marble and hot asphalt. With every footfall, you feel ancestral songlines weaving through your soles, urging you to remember old rhythms.  

To your right, the city pulses with a different drumbeat: pop anthems flashing on giant screens, laughter spilling from rooftop cafés where people sip spiced lattes from paper cups. A group of friends waves you over; their jackets are stamped with slogans you learned to chant in your adopted home. They laugh in a language that tastes like possibility—slang that loops off the tongue in fast, bright ribbons. They invite you to dance on a rooftop ledge, to join a modern ritual of bass and strobe lights.  

As you move, your embroidered tunic from home flutters open, revealing a neon T-shirt beneath. The two garments cling to you like half-remembered dreams. In one hand, you cradle a porcelain cup of jasmine tea, its steam curling into ghostly kites; in the other, a stainless steel tumbler of cold brew, condensation dripping onto your palm. You can’t let go of either.  

Above you, the lanterns rise into the sky, forming a living constellation: one half glows in ancient cinnabar, the other pulses in electric cyan. You stretch your arms and find yourself spinning—between pillars of time and towers of glass. The ancestral spirits drift around your shoulders like silk scarves, their whisper soft yet insistent: “Carry your heritage into new worlds.” The city friends cheer in your ears: “You’re one of us—show us your spark.”  

In that suspended instant, you breathe in both worlds at once. The incense swirling from the temple tastes of your childhood; the neon lights taste of your future. You close your eyes, and in the silent cathedral of your mind, the two identities entwine. A single phoenix lantern blossoms at your chest, its wings painted with temple calligraphy on one side and with graffiti tags on the other.  

And then you wake—heart ablaze with promise, feet still echoing the pulse of two drumbeats, ready to weave together every color of your boundless dream.
