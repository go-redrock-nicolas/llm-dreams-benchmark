I am dreaming. You're in a dream, and you’re standing on the edge of an expansive, dusty savanna. The air is buzzing, not with the familiar hum of technology, but with a strange anticipation. In front of you, there’s a horizonless field where the land is an endless carpet of golden grass, shimmering under the sun. This is not a place you recognize, and yet, there's an uncanny sense that something very familiar is lurking just beyond your field of vision. It’s as though you're supposed to know this space, but the memory of it escapes you entirely, like a forgotten dream within a dream.

You begin to walk through the tall grass, the blades brushing against your skin like a thousand soft whispers. The sound is like a constant, soft static, like white noise, and you suddenly realize you're not alone. Shadows flicker at the corner of your vision, moving at the edge of the grass, brushing past you without ever quite revealing themselves. You feel their presence more than you see them—creatures that don’t belong in this world, things you know shouldn’t exist.

There’s no sky above you, only a thick, gray canopy of clouds that stretches across eternity, as if you’re enclosed in a glass box. There's a thickness in the air, as though the atmosphere itself is slowing you down, pressing in from all sides, a heavy invisible force keeping you in place. And then, you notice something beyond the grass. There’s a clearing up ahead, a circle of dirt where nothing grows. The clearing is perfectly circular, a dark patch in the middle of the savanna, like a portal cut out of reality.

You feel drawn toward it.

The closer you get to the clearing, the more you sense that the ground beneath your feet is shifting ever so slightly. You hear something beneath the ground, something scurrying, crawling, burrowing, scratching at the earth in irregular patterns. It’s as though the dirt itself is alive, breathing with the rhythm of something unseen. You’re almost at the edge of the circle now, and as you step into it, the earth beneath you seems to give way, pulling you down.

But it’s not the ground beneath you anymore. It’s something else. You realize with a jolt of terror that you’re not standing on grass anymore. You're on something soft, yet firm. The ground is transforming beneath your feet, turning into something like flesh, soft and pliable. The sensation of it running through your toes sends a shiver down your spine. The earth is no longer earth—it's alive. The air is thick with the smell of something like rotting wood, moldering leaves, and beneath it all, a faint sweetness that you can’t quite place.

You’re sinking.

As your feet press into the ground, it molds around you, pulling you in like quicksand. Panic surges through your chest, and you try to yell, but no sound comes out. All around you, the soft earthiscrawling, a thousand hollow little tubes, like the veins of some vast plant, pumping life and energy and sound into the ground. But this plant isn’t growing—it's decomposing, disintegrating in slow motion, and somehow, you are the catalyst. The sound of your pulse thrums loudly in your ears, competing with the sickly churning beneath.

The grass gives way to coarse bristles, like the legs of countless insects brushing against your body. It's as though you’ve fallen into the body of some grotesque organism, a creature with no head, no eyes, no brain—only the blind, grasping instinct of life itself. Your hands slide into the damp, living soil, which is neither warm nor cold. It is simply there, indifferent, stretching out into the void.

Something moves beneath you.

You realize it’s not the ground anymore—it’s a tunnel. You drop down into it, sliding through a maze of dark, wet matter. This is no longer the earth; it’s the inside of something you do not understand. You have no control, no way to stop your descent. The walls around you are closing in, soft and fleshy, pressing in on you from all sides. You can feel everything: the moist, slippery texture, the sticky touch of something raw, something primal. You can hear the sound of slow, rhythmic breathing, in and out, in and out, like the earth itself is alive.

You’re spiraling deeper, and your entire body feels wrong. It’s as if you are transforming, your skin absorbing into the earth around it, like you’re dissolving into the world itself. You feel the thrumming of unseen organs, a pulse that’s not yours but is now part of you, surrounding you, coming from every direction. And then, just as you’re about to lose yourself to the numb terror, you feel the tunnel opening up, and you emerge...

You open your eyes.

You're staring up at the same gray canopy, except it’s no longer a canopy—it’s an eye. A colossal, unblinking eye staring down at you. It's vast, stretching as far as you can see, filling your vision entirely, a vast iris of gray, flecked with specks of vibrant color that seem to shift and move. The eye is calm, as though observing you, and you realize you’re in its gaze, that you have somehow become a part of this being’s body. Its pupil narrows infinitesimally, and you feel an immense weight of something—a thought, a presence—looming over you, analyzing you, assessing you.

The dream shifts.

You are no longer you. You are now something else entirely—an organism that has crawled out of the earth, still half-formed, trembling, with fingers that end in tendrils. You taste the air and see the savanna as if through new eyes, but your senses are jumbled, alien. The dream has become something else now—you're no longer a witness, you're a participant in a strange, biological symphony where you're not quite sure which part you’re playing. The dream grows more fragmented, shifting between textures and colors and forms, until you can no longer remember what it was like to be human, or what it means to be awake.

Suddenly, you feel yourself start to wake.

The transition is violent. The colors sharpen, the textures become harsh. The last thing you see, before you fully wake up, is the eye. It is massive, and somehow, impossibly, it is made of you. The dream is gone. You are awake, lying in bed, heart pounding, breathless. But something deep inside feels different, shifting inside of you, as if a piece of that dream world has lingered, waiting to be pulled back into your waking life.

You sit up, and the dream lingers like a shadow at the edge of your mind, impossible to shake.
