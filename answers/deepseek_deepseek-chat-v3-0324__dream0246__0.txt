I am dreaming. The sky is a bruised purple, the kind of color that weighs heavy on your eyelids, pressing down like a cold hand. The air smells of iron and frost, sharp enough to sting my nostrils with each ragged breath. I'm standing on a vast, sloping expanse of snow, but something is wrong—beneath its pristine white surface, the earth groans.  

The first sound is a low, rolling *crack*—like the spine of the world snapping. The snow underfoot shifts, sagging like wet paper. Before I can bolt, the mountain shudders.

**"Do you want to wake up?"**  

Then—silence. The dream dissolves into static, and I am—
