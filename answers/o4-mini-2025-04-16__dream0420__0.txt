I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the rim of a glassy lagoon under a sky woven from living ribbons of purple and gold. Every breath you take fills your lungs with the gentle hum of stars, and the water before you ripples in patterns of memory. As you lean forward, your reflection shimmers and shifts—at first you see the small, fearful child who once trembled at every new beginning, heart clutched tight in a knot of “I can’t” and “not good enough.”  

But then the mirror-image begins to smile, and with each rise of its lips, a soft crack appears in its armor of doubt. The child-version of yourself steps forward, lantern in hand, traces glowing in the vapor. She waves to you, beckoning. You wade ankle-deep into the lagoon’s liquid light, and as you approach, the old belief you’ve carried since childhood—“I am too weak,” “I don’t belong,” or “I will fail again”—floats up from the water like a fragile paper boat.  

You lean down and touch the boat’s bright sail: a memory of every time you doubted yourself, every time you stuttered under someone’s gaze, every ache of shame you tucked away. In your palm it dissolves into swirls of silver mist. The child-self watches, eyes wide but trusting. Then, with a breath like a soft wind chime, you cup the mist and release it back into the lagoon. It spirals upward, bursting into motes of light that drift into the sky’s living ribbons.  

Suddenly the lagoon’s surface shatters into a thousand petals of opal and jade. Each petal carries away a piece of that old story—the one that said you couldn’t, shouldn’t, weren’t enough. In its place, the water settles into a perfectly still mirror of possibility. The child-self steps onto the bank and stretches her arms wide, as if greeting a sunrise yet to come. Behind her, the sky pulses with promise; you feel your chest loosen, your heart expand.  

You awaken in the dream, not in a bed but on a sailboat of moonlight, drifting toward the horizon you’ve never allowed yourself to see. The outdated belief is gone, transformed into stardust. Ahead lies a canvass painted in choice, wonder, and the uncharted you.
