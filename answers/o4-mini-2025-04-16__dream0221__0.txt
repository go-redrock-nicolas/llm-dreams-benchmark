I am dreaming. You drift through a sky that glows like spilled honey, suspended between a field of floating lantern-lilies and wisps of starlit mist. Suddenly, unfelt until now, a power hums in your palms—the uncanny ability to coax living sculpture out of pure light. Each gesture ripples the air like liquid crystal, and strands of iridescent energy curl and twist, shaping themselves around your fingers.

As you awaken to this hidden gift, the world around you rearranges itself. The lantern-lilies melt into bouquets of sky-orchids; their petals refract your very thoughts, turning anxious sparks into soft violet ripples. You watch in wonder as a simple wish—“I want to create beauty”—becomes a sculpture of intertwined glass-light serpents that coil and dance at your command.

Then a hush falls over the dreamscape. A great amphitheater—its seats formed of pearlescent seashells—lowers itself from the clouds. Spectators appear at the rim of each shell: ancestral silhouettes in drifting robes, whalesong resonating in the distance, even curious fireflies staining the air with emerald pulses. A single voice, both thunder and lullaby, whispers through the mists: “Demonstrate your gift.”

Your heart hammers like distant thunder as you step onto a stage spun from starlight and dew. The assembled crowd leans forward, anticipation rippling through them like wind across water. You raise your hands, trembling, and at first nothing happens—until a droplet of sweat on your brow flickers into life, unfolding like a tiny sun. You gasp, realizing that every fragment of your being can feed this miracle.

With the second breath, you let go of fear. Light surges upward from your core, coalescing into a grand tapestry of living geometry. Golden arches unfurl, violet filaments spiral, and emerald prisms revolve in harmonious orbit. Each shape pulses to an unheard rhythm, vibrating in time with your own heartbeat. Spectators lean so far they seem to merge with the sea of clouds below them, eyes shining with awe.

As you refine your craft mid-dream, the sculptures begin to sing—an ethereal chorus that tastes like ripe nectar on your tongue. A serpent of pure sapphire light glides toward the edge of the stage, trailing silver motes that drift into spectators’ palms and vanish. In that moment, you understand: you are not merely showing a trick, but weaving hope and wonder into the very fabric of this dream-world.

When the last prism dissolves in a flash of rainbow light, silence reigns for a heartbeat—and then the amphitheater erupts in waves of applause that sound like wind-bell lullabies. You stand there, chest heaving, bathed in luminescent applause. Every being present raises a hand in salute, each finger a flickering star.

As the dream begins to fold in upon itself, you feel the echo of that power deep in your bones. Long after the amphitheater fades, you carry within you the spark of that impossible talent—knowing that, in any world, waking or dreaming, you could once again call forth living art from the very air.
