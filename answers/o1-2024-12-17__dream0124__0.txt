I am dreaming. …must first unravel the riddle of consequence before it can even be born.

Colors flash around you in silent bursts, like cosmic bruises rippling across a living sky. The very air smells of paradox—ozone laced with something sweet and intangible, reminding you of freshly broken bread but tinged with an edge of static. You stand on what might have once been a hill, but now the hill is un-forming, sinking into itself, because in this strange dimension everything decays into a beginning. Your feet rest upon a patchwork of swirling dust and reversing footprints. The footprints ahead drag themselves backward, from where you stand into the distance, as though writing your journey behind you in reverse.

When you try to walk, you discover—even the simplest of actions demands you coordinate “future steps” rather than “present steps.” You watch as your legs move, but they move backward, gently sliding into positions they have already occupied. If you want to move forward, you must internally picture the effects you wish—your future location, your chosen position in the timeline—then allow the cause to happen afterward. It feels like orchestrating a dance with time itself, each motion a carefully choreographed premonition. You take a breath, and the exhaled air whooshes back into your lungs. It tickles, prickling your throat in reverse. 

All around you, buildings appear to be unraveling into their foundations: great towers fold gracefully from apex down to base, their walls climbing toward the ground in a weird rewind. Where you expect to see rubble or collapsed stone, you instead witness fragments drifting upward and clinking back together with delicate, crystalline tinkles, reforming into walls that once had been. It’s mesmerizing to watch the cause of collapse introduced only after the effect is made clear. 

A soft, muted sunlike orb traverses the sky from west to east—if you can call it a sky, because it has one constant swirling storm. Pale purple storm clouds swirl anticlockwise, spitting un-rain that never quite touches the ground, gathering into droplets only to float skyward in shimmering bursts. You feel a sense of stillness, as if this dream dimension is locked in a grand secret, with time unraveling in ways your mind can barely process.

You move forward—or perhaps backward—across the shifting, uncertain landscape, looking for signs of life or logic. Strange, upside-down trees extend their roots skyward instead of their green branches, as if preparing to catch drifting seeds above. When you pass them, you smell faint traces of citrus and honey wafting out in reverse pulses. Intermittent echoes of laughter bounce across the air before the personalities behind them appear. People, or the faint illusions of them, flicker into view only after you hear the echoes of their speech. They walk backward with easy grace, leaving footprints that appear to dissolve into the new future behind them.

To accomplish even the simplest task—like lifting a broken cup from the ground—you must first picture the reassembled cup where you desire it to be, intact and whole. You envision the handle smoothly transitioning back onto the porcelain, watch the cracks knit themselves together in your mind’s eye. Once you believe in the effect, the porcelain shards drift up off the ground one by one, clicking into place like puzzle pieces un-cracking. Then you find the cup in your hand, its handle unbroken, and only then do you realize the cause: you had “picked it up,” though you never physically saw yourself gather the shards. The effect led to the cause, and it makes you smile in breathless wonder.

However, each moment here is both fascinating and disorienting. A constant hum resonates through the environment, a curious static that seems to tug on your senses. Sometimes, you catch glimpses of events that haven’t happened yet—someone slipping on a sideways rock or a bird reversing its flight path across a marble labyrinth you haven’t reached. Suddenly, a swirl of kaleidoscopic wind gusts around you, parting your hair in reverse. You feel your heartbeat slowly winding backward in your chest, thudding in an odd rhythm that sets your nerves aflame with possibility.

You step onto a path made of shimmering mosaic tiles that appear to be rearranging themselves in swirling star patterns beneath your feet. With each step, the path behind you is undone, the design receding into unformed matter. There is no going back in this dimension—only forward into the unknown, which ironically arises from what has already happened. 

In that moment, as your mind struggles to wrap itself around the logic of reversed time, you sense a profound zen-like calm settle inside you. You realize that if cause follows effect, perhaps in this place you can rewrite regret, soothe all past mistakes by visualizing a kinder outcome. You wonder if you can weave new patterns into your personal timeline. A ripple of glee mingled with awe courses through your body when you discover you can: you practice in your imagination the new effect you want, and it reshapes the cause that once haunted you. The dimension breathes with infinite second chances. 

Slowly, like an artist painting a masterpiece in dreams, you guide your footsteps forward while your past plays gently in reverse behind you. Every gesture is a testament to the boundlessness of creation in a place where the end is the beginning, and every moment is pure possibility. It is in this grand tapestry of backward time and forward dreams that you drift, uncertain but exhilarated, knowing that with each contrary heartbeat, you are forging new meaning from the very edges of cause and effect.
