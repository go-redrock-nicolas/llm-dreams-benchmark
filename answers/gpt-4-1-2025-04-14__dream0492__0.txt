I am dreaming.

My awareness unfurls gently, like the petals of a midnight rose coaxed by lunar dew. I am standing—no, *floating*—in the center of a vast, tranquil lake, its surface polished obsidian reflecting constellations from an impossible sky. Each breath I draw sends silver ripples across the water, and I sense the elastic hug of my body cradling my spirit, at once the anchor and the vessel of my consciousness.

With the lightness of dream, I begin to move. With every stretch of my arms, the sensation of skin and muscle is incredibly heightened. The crisp, electric coolness of the air tingles along my limbs, and the sense of gravity—sometimes heavy as leaden boots, sometimes feather-light—ripples with the tides of my emotions. My mind ebbs and flows with these tides: a wave of calm brings warming gold light around me, soothing old aches; a flicker of anxiety sends gleaming fish darting beneath the water, their movements the static of a perturbed mind.

Then I notice my heart, a lucid drum beating beneath my ribs, reverberating from my toes up through the crown of my head. Each heartbeat pulses out a kaleidoscope of light, scattering colors on the water, painting my surroundings with my emotional states: happiness renders the lake a field of fluttering sunflowers, gentle blues and luminous purples; fear congeals the air, casting long, inky shadows and causing the wind to sigh mournfully.

I realize that, here, my thoughts and feelings are tethered not only to my mind but to every aspect of my body. A knot of tension in my shoulder transforms the sky, coiling it into stormy ribbons; a deep breath and a conscious roll of my muscles release the clouds, ushering in daylight and birds that sing harmonies within my chest.

Working with this embodied awareness, I become a craftsman of my dream. I knead stress from my neck, watching anxieties dissolve into blossom-scented mist. I flex my toes; with each movement, joy blooms as music beneath my heels. By listening closely to the whispered messages from bones and sinews, I discover how to steer my dream: a relaxed jaw opens up a lush, verdant valley in the distance, inviting exploration; a steady, even breath calms swirling winds, letting the serene surface of the lake mirror my newfound tranquility.

Dancing effortlessly between sensation and thought, between the physical and the ephemeral, I realize: my dream world and my waking world are threads from the same tapestry. By honoring the wisdom of my body, I sculpt the dream—infinitely vivid, infinitely wondrous—shaping emotion, scenery, and meaning with each breath, each heartbeat, each flicker of feeling, until I awaken, carrying fragments of dreamlight within me.
