I am dreaming. I stand at the precipice of a vast, glowing chasm, its depths alive with writhing tendrils of iridescent light that pulse like veins. Ahead, a bridge of fractured crystal arcs into a vortex of swirling constellations—so close, yet the air warps as though reality itself rejects my passage. The triumph of overcoming earlier trials fades as a shadow descends, cold and silent, and I realize: the true labyrinth is not the path behind, but the abyss within.  
In the shifting shadows of the dream, my breath crystallizes into emerald mist, each exhale carving hieroglyphs that hover, humming with forgotten tongues. The bridge fractures beneath me, each shard a mirror reflecting versions of myself—warrior, beggar, starved poet—all reaching, screaming, dissolving. 

The chasm breathes. Its light curdles into a chorus of hands, slick with liquid twilight, plucking at my limbs. I laugh, soundless, as the constellations above invert. The sky becomes an abyssal well, its pull unraveling my seams. 

Footsteps echo. My own, multiplied. Behind me, a garden of thorns blooms from my footprints, each barbed stem bearing eyes that weep mercury. They whisper in fractal tongues: *You are the key that rusts in its own lock.*

Ahead, the vortex splits. A spiral stairway materializes, carved from the rib of some leviathan, its steps stained with the ochre of ancient sunsets. As I ascend, muscles burning with phantom gravity, the air thickens to nectar. The stars drip. They pool around my ankles, liquid constellations that map the anatomy of old wars, forgotten loves—each step a birth, each breath a funeral.

At the summit, a door of black ice. My reflection there does not mimic me. It kneels, head bowed, cradling a dying sun in its palms. When our eyes meet, it mouths, *Break it.* 

The cry of a newborn galaxy splits the silence. I raise my fist. The ice does not shatter. It consumes.
