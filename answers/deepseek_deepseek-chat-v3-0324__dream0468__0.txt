I am dreaming. I am dreaming of a vast, endless sky filled with swirling colors like liquid silk—amber, violet, and deep emerald—melting into one another as if painted by some celestial hand. The air hums with an energy that vibrates through my bones, a low, resonant song that feels both ancient and newborn. Below me, the ground shifts like water, but when I touch it, it solidifies into warm stone beneath my fingertips, intricate carvings surfacing as if my very presence brings them to life. 

I realize, as I walk forward, that I am not alone. Figures made of light shimmer in the distance, their forms flickering between human and something else—something wilder, untamed. They whisper without sound, their voices carried on the wind like a secret meant just for me. One steps forward, its face a shifting mosaic of stars, and I feel a sudden, urgent pull in my chest. I open my mouth to speak—to ask, to demand, to understand—but the words rush out tangled, uneven, a storm of emotion before thought. 

The star-being tilts its head, patient. The world around us pulses, waiting. I close my eyes, breathe in the electric air, and try again—this time slower, deliberate. The words form like crystals in my mind, solid and clear, before I let them go. 

The being smiles, and the dream shifts. The sky parts, revealing a colossal tree with roots that dip into the void and branches that hold entire galaxies like fruit. It’s dazzling, overwhelming, but I am not afraid. For the first time in the dream, I feel... heard. 

And then I wake, the echo of that moment still humming in my veins.
