I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Shattered Mirror**  

I am dreaming.  

The world around me shifts, a liquid haze of twilight purples and molten gold. The air hums with the scent of burning cedar and distant rain. I stand in a vast, echoing hall where the walls are infinite mirrors, each reflecting a different version of myself—some radiant, some hollow-eyed, some whispering secrets I can’t quite hear.  

Before me stands *her*, my closest confidant, my sharpest mirror—the person whose thoughts have always carved clarity into my chaos. But tonight, her form flickers like candlelight in wind, and her voice is edged with something unfamiliar. A crack in the harmony.  

*"You’re wrong,"* she says, but her words ripple through the air like stones breaking water. The reflections in the mirrors shudder.  

I reach out, but my hand passes through hers like smoke. A static-charged panic thrums in my throat. This isn’t just disagreement—it’s separation, the fracturing of something foundational. The floor beneath us splinters into floating islands of stained glass, each shard a memory: us laughing under a meteor shower, her silence when I needed direction, now this—her disappointment liquid and hot, staining the space between us.  

I try to speak, but the dream mutes my voice. Shadows coil around her wrists, pulling her backward into the dark beyond the mirrors. A choice surges in my chest—cling to pride and let the rift widen, or step into the unknown, toward her vanishing figure.  

As I leap across the shifting glass, the dream fractures into kaleidoscope colors, the tension unresolved but alive, humming with the unspoken question: *How far will you go to mend what’s breaking?*  

Then—a gasp, and I’m awake, the ghost of her voice still tangled in my lungs.
