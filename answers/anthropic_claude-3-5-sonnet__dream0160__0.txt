I am dreaming. ....

I find myself in a labyrinth of shattered glass offices, each wall reflecting countless versions of my professional demise like a hall of mirrors gone wrong. The fluorescent lights above flicker in an anxious rhythm, casting dancing shadows that seem to mock my predicament. I can see the ghostly images of past failures floating by - the startup that imploded, the partnership that dissolved in bitter accusations, the innovation that someone else patented first.

The air feels thick with the weight of judgment, and I'm wearing a suit that seems to be slowly unraveling thread by thread, a perfect metaphor for my unspooling career. Each step I take echoes with the whispers of former colleagues, their words a mixture of pity and schadenfreude.

But then something strange begins to happen. The broken glass beneath my feet starts to shift and reform, creating a spiraling pathway that leads upward. Each shard contains a lesson learned, a skill gained, a relationship forged through adversity. The very failures that haunt me begin to emit a soft, peculiar light, transforming into stepping stones.

As I ascend this crystalline spiral, I realize my suit isn't unraveling - it's metamorphosing into something new, something stronger, woven from the very fabric of resilience. The reflections in the glass no longer show defeat but rather show infinite possibilities, each one born from the ashes of previous setbacks.

At the apex, I stand in a chamber where the walls are no longer glass but pure light. My previous catastrophes orbit around me like planets around a sun, each one a testament to survival, each one a badge of honor rather than a mark of shame. I understand now - what looked like destruction was actually a cosmic renovation of my professional self.

The dream begins to fade, but not before I see my reflection one final time - scarred but unbroken, experienced rather than expired, transformed rather than terminated. The last thing I hear is my own laughter, echoing with the revelation that career endings are really just forceful redirections toward unexpected beginnings...

I awaken, the taste of possibility still fresh on my tongue.
