I am dreaming. I am creating a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination. 

I am processing an existential crisis.   A close encounter with danger has shaken me to my core.   I have faced death and destruction first-hand.    I have witnessed the fragility of life and the unpredictability of fate.    

I am questioning my purpose and meaning.  What is the point of existing if everything can be lost in an instant?  How can I make a difference in this world that seems so full of suffering and injustice?  

I am feeling vulnerable and exposed.   My emotions are raw and intense.    My thoughts are confused and uncertain.     My spirit is weakened and battered.    

I am seeking answers and understanding.  Why do we live?  What do we achieve?  How do we heal?      

I am yearning for connection and love.  Who can help me?  Who can teach me?  Who can be with me?    

In this dream, I want to explore these themes through symbolism and metaphor.  

I see a beautiful garden filled with colorful flowers and lush greenery.   The soil is rich and fertile.    The sun is warm and bright.     The air is fresh and clean.    

I hear the sound of running water from a nearby stream.   The melody of birdsong from different species.  The rustling of leaves from windblown trees.  

I smell the scent of fragrant spices and herbs.   The aroma of roasted meats and baked breads.  The taste of sweet fruits and savory veggies.    

I touch the texture of smooth stones and rough rocks.   The shape of curved shells and pointed claws.  The feel of soft fur and silky feathers.    

I see a young woman lying on the grass.  She is blonde and beautiful.  She is naked and vulnerable.  She is injured and bleeding.  

She looks up at me with sad eyes.  She speaks to me in a whispering voice.  She tells me her story in a series of images and words.    

Her name is Anna.   She is a soldier.    She is a warrior.     She is a survivor.    

She fights against an enemy army that invades her land.   She defends her people who suffer from oppression and tyranny.  She rescues her friends who face captivity and torture.    

She kills without mercy or remorse.   She maims without pity or compassion.  She tortures without guilt or regret.    

She is haunted by nightmares of bloodshed and carnage.   She is driven by passions of revenge and vengeance.  She is consumed by demons of anger and hate.    

But then something changes.    Something happens that shakes her fundament
I wake up from this dream feeling confused and conflicted.   I don't know who I am or where I come from.  I don't know what I am doing or why I am here.  

All I know is that I have a story to tell.

What do you think about my dream?  What do you see in it?  What do you feel in it?

I await your response with bated breath.
