I am dreaming. Suddenly, I feel an intense spiritual connection. I'm overwhelmed by visions of glowing symbols and vibrant colors. The world feels alive and energy swirls around me. I reach out, and my fingertips brush something intangible. I'm lifted into the air, surrounded by a soft golden light. Everything feels peaceful and infinite. Then I wake up.\n
