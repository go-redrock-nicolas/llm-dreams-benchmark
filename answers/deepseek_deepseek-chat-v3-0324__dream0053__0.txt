I am dreaming. The air is thick with the acrid scent of burning wires and crumbling plaster. A distant alarm wails in erratic bursts, as if the building itself is gasping for breath. The walls around me shudder, groaning under some unseen weight—maybe the floors above buckling, maybe something worse. Flickering fluorescent lights cast jagged shadows that twist like living things, creeping along the cracked tile floor.  

I don't remember how I got here—only the suffocating certainty that I *must move, now.*  

Down the hall, a broken pipe gushes steaming water, pooling in unnatural shapes that ripple against the warped floorboards. Something about the way the liquid moves sets my nerves on edge—there’s a sluggish, almost *purposeful* flow to it, as though it’s searching. Testing.  

A door to my left shudders violently, its hinges squealing. Behind it, something rasps in uneven, phlegmy breaths. It scratches at the wood—long, slow drags of something sharp. Too sharp.  

I bolt in the opposite direction, skidding around a corner just as something wet and heavy *thuds* against the door behind me. The walls shift—the corridor narrows, the ceiling dipping lower. A vent above trembles, then bursts open in a spray of rust, disgorging a tangle of wires that slither like serpents, each one crackling with erratic, blue-white sparks.  

There—a staircase, half-collapsed but still intact. I leap over a gap where the steps have given way, landing hard on the trembling metal. Below, the darkness stirs. Shapes shift in the void, their outlines blurring like oil in water.  

Just as I reach the next floor, the walls split open with a sound like splintering bone. A thick, gel-like substance oozes out—translucent, veined with black tendrils. Globules of it stretch and snap, forming grotesque, unblinking eyes that lock onto me. The ceiling *weeps* the same fluid.  

Somewhere deep in the building, a clock chimes—wrong, too slow, each toll warped and dripping with distorted echoes.  

I can't stay. I can't stop.  

Fire erupts down the next hallway, not natural flames but something sickly green, consuming the air itself with a sound like whispering voices. The floor beneath my feet softens, squelching, threatening to swallow me whole—  

And then I see it. A frayed emergency exit sign, flickering stubbornly through the haze. The door is rusted shut, the handle coated in that same impossible slime, but I lunge for it—  

The second my fingers make contact, everything **lurches.**  

And I wake—gasping, tangled in sweat-drenched sheets, the echoes of that distorted clock still ringing in my skull.  

The dream is over.  

But for a single, breathless moment, I swear something sticky lingers on my fingertips.
