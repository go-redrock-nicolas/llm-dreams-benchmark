I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I find myself in a bustling auditorium packed with people eager for intellectual discourse. The air is charged with anticipation as I take my place at the podium to engage in a heated debate about economic policy. My opponent, a sharp-tongued journalist known for his incendiary rhetoric, stands across from me, his eyes burning with the intensity of a predatory animal.

Hours of impassioned arguments and rebuttals pass in a blur. The audience grows more agitated, siding with whichever speaker they favor. I maintain my composure, refusing to let my emotions get the better of me as the debate rages on.
