I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You stand at the heart of a vast, inverted cathedral suspended in the void between stars. The ceiling is a kaleidoscope of swirling nebulae, each color pulsing in time with the rhythmic hum of a thousand unseen engines. Below you, a lattice of glowing filaments stretches across a chasm of liquid shadow, where time itself seems to pool and ripple like ink in water. This is the Convergence—a ritual older than memory, where the threads of fate are rewoven by hand. Your hands.  

The operation demands perfection. Each filament is a life, a choice, a fracture in reality. You pluck them one by one, weaving new patterns with a needle forged from the first light of creation. Your assistants—translucent beings with faces like fractured mirrors—chant equations that bend space, their voices harmonizing with the thrum of the cosmos. The air smells of ozone and forgotten lullabies.  

But then—the variables.  

A star collapses prematurely, its death-throes sending a shockwave of entropy through the lattice. The filaments shiver, unraveling into fractal spirals that hiss and snap like live wires. One of your assistants fractures into shards, their voice dissolving into static. The liquid shadow below begins to rise, hungry and gelatinous, whispering your deepest fears in your own voice.  

You adapt.  

You grab a falling shard of the broken assistant and press it to your temple. Instantly, your mind splinters into a thousand perspectives: a child’s lost mitten, a dying galaxy, the ache of a forgotten god. You see the pattern beneath the chaos—the hidden symmetry. With a scream that sounds like a cello string snapping, you plunge the shard into the lattice, not to repair it, but to *reshape* it. The filaments ignite, burning in hues no spectrum could name, and the shadow recoils, hissing.  

The Convergence shifts. Where there was once a tapestry of rigid paths, you’ve woven a spiral—a dance of infinite possibilities. The remaining assistants falter, then laugh, their voices now bells ringing in a hurricane. The nebulae above flare, not in condemnation, but in recognition.  

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue and the echo of a thousand lives humming in your bones. The dream clings to you, a phantom weight both exhilarating and mournful, as though you’ve glimpsed the loom that weaves your own reality—and realized it’s been waiting for you to take the needle all along.
