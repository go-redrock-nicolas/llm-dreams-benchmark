I am dreaming. …stand beneath a sky marbled with the soot of calamity—red and bruised like the aftermath of thunder. The air is thick with smoke and desperate echoes; sirens wail above the guttural chorus of the injured, the lost, the frightened.

Makeshift stretchers and shivering survivors clog the concrete avenue—children clinging to the hollow-eyed, grit-streaked adults who keep scanning the horizon for a sign: hope, rescue, mercy. I clasp a battered clipboard, trembling in my latex-gloved hand, and feel the scathing press of time and consequence. Color-coded tags raggedly flutter from torn coats—red for urgent, yellow for delayed, green for minor, black for the gone. But boundaries blur; who can judge at a glance all these bruised souls, when the fire of need burns in every eye?

A man in a torn business suit pleads for help for his wife, cradling her prone on a shopping cart. Blood blossoms through her shirt with every breath. A child with a twisted leg weeps beside the toppled remains of a bicycle, gaze locked on me–and I have only two doses of morphine, and the shattered algorithm of my training flips and spins in my mind. Contradictory orders squeal at me through a scratchy radio: treat the most likely to live, no, treat the most in pain, no, follow your gut.

My heart throbs like another wound. I move between bodies—the oldest with their dew-gray hair matted with ash, the youngest crying mama into their own dirty hands—assigning fates with colored tape and whispered apologies. When I kneel by a woman singing gently to herself through fractured ribs, the world narrows to her trembling lips and the tune coated with blood.

As the sun struggles to rise above the burning skyline, the chaos crests. Each choice I make is another stone in the river, another soul ferried across or left behind. Sometimes, I swear I see shadows moving in the corners—figures woven of memory and regret, counting and recounting with me the ones I could not save.

Around me, the city cracks and weeps, sky raining ash and hope in equal measure. I keep going, reeling from the weight of my own hands—improvising, hoping, cracking protocols like eggs and trading them for mercy—until the dream begins to blur, the faces slipping. The only sound is my own voice, hoarse and breaking: I’m trying. I’m trying.
