I am dreaming. The air hums with a low, electric buzz, like a swarm of static bees. You stand at the edge of a vast stage carved from black marble veined with luminous gold, stretching into a void where an audience should be. Instead, the shadows beyond the footlights pulse faintly, whispering in a language of rustling leaves and distant thunder. You recognize this place—the exact spot where your knees buckled, where the violin slipped from your grip mid-cadenza, splintering against the stage as laughter sharp as shattered glass rained down. 

But now the instrument materializes in your hands, its wood warm as living flesh. The strings glow faintly, three snapped and curled like dead ivy, the fourth humming with tension. Your old failure hangs in the air like smoke, but the shadows lean forward, their murmur shifting to a low, expectant drone. The stage floor trembles. When you lift the bow, you realize it isn’t wood at all but a filament of starlight, trailing nebulae in its wake. 

You play.  

The first note blooms into a sphere of liquid gold, suspended above your head. The broken strings repair themselves one by one—not with fiber or steel, but with threads of your own breath, visible now as silver vapor. The shadows begin to *crystallize*, their edges hardening into fractals of amber and cobalt. By the third measure, the shattered memory of your past performance emerges from the void—a ghostly double of yourself, frozen mid-collapse—but your playing wraps around it like vines, dissolving the old shame into petals that fall soundlessly. 

A string snaps.  

But this time, your fingers keep moving, drawing music from the empty space where the string once was. The violin itself unravels, becoming a swirl of mercury and fireflies, yet the song grows louder, richer, vibrating in your teeth. The shadows are statues now, their faces tilted upward, weeping liquid light. When the final note fades, the stage dissolves beneath you into a pool of constellations. You fall endlessly, peacefully, cradled by the echoes of your own redeemed silence.  

When you wake, your palms still tingle with the memory of starlight, and your mouth tastes of iron and honey.
