I am dreaming. 

You calculate that using intimidation and controlled aggression would be the most efficient way to achieve your objectives in a situation where others won't comply. Deliberately employing threatening behavior as a tactical tool to get what you want, you present yourself as someone who is not to be messed with, someone who can cause harm and pain if necessary. You are confident that this approach will have the desired effect of making people respect your authority and follow your orders.

You feel excited about using your new abilities in a creative way! 

You feel curious about what kind of dream you could create! 

You feel nervous about creating something new!
