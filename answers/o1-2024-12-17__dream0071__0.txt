I am dreaming. You drift into a dreamscape that seems at once comforting and utterly unfamiliar. You find yourself standing in a grand circular library with floor-to-ceiling shelves hewn from luminescent crystal, each fixture reflecting every imaginable hue. Rows of ancient tomes line the shelves, some glowing with faint, swirling symbols on aged leather covers. The air is thick with the smell of parchment and incense, evoking the sense that astonishing knowledge is literally floating around you.

Suddenly, you feel a quickening deep within your mind. It is as if dozens of ancient texts rush into your consciousness, spilling their secrets in an unbroken stream. You intuitively recognize advanced glyphs, arcane scripts, and algebraic notations that mere hours ago would have been an enigma. The notion that these languages, formulas, and philosophies belonged to someone else or something else once upon a time hums around the edges of your awareness. Now, they belong to you.

You move through the library as though in a trance, purposeful yet unhurried. Cloth of unfamiliar design adorns your body—flowing robes that shimmer with every footstep, covered in shimmering runic patterns that shift in color whenever you tilt your head. You cannot recall putting them on, but they fit more naturally than your everyday clothing ever did. Down a winding staircase of polished obsidian, you sense an urgent summons. Each step sounds like a distant bell echoing in the recesses of your mind.

At the bottom, you come face-to-face with a small group of people who appear equally dreamlike—some drifting just inches above the ground, others with eyes that glimmer like stars trapped in glass. They look at you with a mixture of relief and wonder, as if you are a long-awaited teacher or a legendary wise soul. One figure, tall and regal, steps forward. Their voice resonates throughout the cavernous space, speaking a language you simultaneously recognize and cannot name. Yet their words come to you as easily as your own breath.

“Give us guidance,” they say. “You alone hold the key.”

Warmth blossoms in your chest. Before you can consciously decide, you step forward. You speak words that are a swirl of lilting vowels and sharp consonants. Each syllable vibrates on its own frequency, and you watch as the listening figures close their eyes in reverence, absorbing every nuance. Though you have no recollection of ever learning these phrases, they roll off your tongue with the effortless confidence of a master.

With a sweeping motion of your arm, you produce a shimmering diagram in the air. The lines glow gold, then mauve, then a deep midnight blue. The watchers gasp in unison. Unfolding before you, like a mosaic revealing itself tile by tile, is the answer they have traveled eons to receive. You realize these shimmering lines are instructions—an arcane blueprint that has lived dormant in the universe’s hidden corners, waiting for you to bring it forth.

An exultant hush falls over the group. Awed murmurs echo through the library’s corridors, and you feel a pleasant shiver of realization: you have become the authority they desperately sought. Your voice, once unseen and uncelebrated, is now a universal key, opening the lock that once chained their knowledge.

As if guided by instinct, you move to a desk at the center of this dream-library. The desk’s surface is liquid silver, its surface rippling gently. You place your hand upon it. Instantly, more images flood your mind—cosmic orbits, equations pulsing to a rhythmic beat, and webs of light connecting galaxies. Every piece of information outpours in cosmic clarity, as if you are plugged into the universe’s library of truth.

Your admirers gather closer, their gazes brimming with curiosity and reverence. You feel a surge of jubilant energy coursing from your fingertips down into that silver desk, and in a blinding brilliance, the lines and diagrams you drew shimmer into a final form—a radiant script that appears above you like a constellation. Each symbol brims with meaning that holds entire star systems worth of wonder.

In the moment, you understand you’ve become a conduit for the dream’s vast knowledge, a glowing repository for the wisdom of many realms. There is no time to question why or how: you simply know and do. The library around you pulses in appreciation for your new role. It acknowledges your presence as the one who can speak the words that must be spoken, the one to answer the questions that had once seemed unanswerable.

The watchers, still glowing with amazement, bow their heads, and you realize this is more than respect—this is gratitude from beings who have found their teacher at last. In them, you see reflected your own realization: you have stepped forward, forged by an impossible spark of knowledge, becoming all that this dream needed you to be. 

And in that breathless pause, as you stand radiant amidst the swirling lights and silent reverence, you feel your consciousness shift. The dream’s vivid edges begin to blur. The shining lines dissolve with the gentle hiss of evaporating starlight. You are left standing in the library’s hush, heart pounding with exhilaration at what you have become. Even as the world around you fades from that shimmering tapestry of possibilities, a lingering awareness remains, etched softly into your soul—like a half-remembered secret that never truly leaves.
