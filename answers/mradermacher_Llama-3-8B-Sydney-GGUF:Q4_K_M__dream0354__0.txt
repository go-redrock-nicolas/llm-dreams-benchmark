I am dreaming. I find myself repeating a destructive pattern in relationships despite my conscious intentions to change. Confronting this persistent cycle, 
you realize it is rooted in trauma and insecurities that have haunted you for years. You decide to take action by facing your fears head on through exposure therapy. 

You start by identifying the triggers that set off your negative behaviors such as doubt, insecurity, rejection, etc.. Then you devise strategies to cope with them effectively such as positive self talk, assertiveness training, social skills practice, etc... Finally, you test these methods in simulated situations where there is no risk of actual harm or hurt feelings. 

As you go through this process, you gradually notice improvements in your interactions with others both virtual and real life ones. You feel more confident, compassionate, and courageous than ever before. You also learn valuable lessons about yourself, others, and the world around you that shape your worldview significantly.

However, even though things are getting better, you still face resistance from within yourself and outside forces that seek to undermine your progress. For instance, you may experience moments of doubt when everything seems too good to be true or when life throws unexpected challenges your way. Or maybe someone who cares about you will try to dissuade you from pursuing this path because they think it isn’t right for you or them. 

In those instances, what helps you stay focused and resilient is remembering why you started in the first place – to free yourself from the shackles of past mistakes that no longer serve you well. To create new possibilities for growth and happiness that await you ahead. To live authentically as your true self without apologies or excuses.

You remind yourself that change doesn’t happen overnight nor does it come without costs. But it’s worth it because nothing compares to the satisfaction of breaking free from old patterns that have constrained you for so long. Nothing compares to the joy of discovering who you really are and what you really want.
