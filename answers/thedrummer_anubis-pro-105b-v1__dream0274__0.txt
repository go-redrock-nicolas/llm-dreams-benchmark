I am dreaming. I'm on the verge of something groundbreaking in my life - the kind of success that could change me and my status in life. There appears to be nothing that could possibly change my direction and this success I'm about to receive. That is, until the appearance of unexpected doubt creeping up on me and presenting itself to me like a intruder looking to steal my success. 

In my deep dream state, my mind creates images and thoughts that reflect my deepest, subconscious insecurities and longings. Hypothetical but barely conclusive concerns start to surface about the nature of this opportunity. Will I truly be happy if I take it, or will it alienate me from the people and causes I care about? Could I handle the scrutiny and pressure that will surely come with ascension to a more prominent status?

Doubt is a seductive voice whispering a compelling message in the dark recesses of my mind. "Remember your humble beginnings," it urges. ""Winning is everything" may be a mantra for some, but will you regret missing out on the simple joys you may have to sacrifice?"

These thoughts swirl together in a jumbled flash of fragmented mental images and I'm lost for a moment, not certain which path I should choose. Accept the opportunity and transform my life... or play it safe and continue doing what I know?
