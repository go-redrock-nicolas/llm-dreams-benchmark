I am dreaming. The air hums with the static charge of unspoken words, pressing against the walls of the dimly lit room where shadows stretch like ink spilled across time. Figures sit around a circular table, their faces flickering between familiarity and strangeness—some with mouths sewn shut by invisible threads, others nodding in a rhythm I don’t recognize. The pressure to agree, to smooth my edges into the shape they expect, coils around my throat like a hand tightening slowly.  

But then—something shifts.  

A pulse of wild, golden light unfurls in my chest, bold as a drumbeat. My fingers curl against the table’s surface, and when I speak, the words vibrate with their own life. The air ripples like disturbed water as my voice spills free, raw and unfiltered. The room tilts. The walls bend inward, then outward, breathing in time with the revelation. The faces around me flicker—some twist in discomfort, others crack open with mirrored defiance, stitches popping, fragments of truth breaking free.  

One figure, cloaked in hesitation, reaches toward me. Their fingertips graze mine, and suddenly the dream dissolves into a burst of feathers—raven-black, iridescent blue—each one etched with a word I had once swallowed but now release into the wind. The ceiling splits open to a sky swirling with constellations I’ve never seen before, spinning like a carousel of fire and shadow. And as my words spiral upward, they ignite—brief, radiant comets against the dark.  

Around me, the silence shatters. And for the first time, I am not just dreaming—I am heard.
