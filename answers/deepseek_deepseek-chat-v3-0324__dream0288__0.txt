I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry – The City of Whispering Shadows**  

I am dreaming.  

The ground beneath me is not ground at all—it is a shifting mosaic of liquid mercury, rippling with every hesitant step I take. The sky is a bruised amethyst, flickering with bioluminescent constellations that rearrange themselves when I blink. A soundless wind tugs at my clothes, though the air is thick, syrupy, like breathing in melted glass.  

I stand at the edge of **The City of Whispering Shadows**, a place built not by hands, but by forgotten thoughts. Towers of obsidian and spun sugar twist into impossible spires, their peaks dissolving into smoke before they can touch the sky. Bridges made of unspooled violin strings sway in the windless breeze, humming a tune just beyond memory.  

And then—the disruption.  

The city *breathes*. The streets contract like a living lung, and the buildings lean toward me, whispering in voices made of rust and honey.  

*"You weren't prepared for this, were you?"*  

The cobblestones turn to liquid beneath my feet. I sink—not into water, but into a viscous dream-matter, ink-black and cold. Hands, half-formed and translucent, rise from the depths, weaving around my wrists like ivy. They do not pull me down. They *guide* me.  

I am falling—no, not falling—*unraveling*. My thoughts peel apart like layers of an overripe fruit. Memories I don’t recognize flash like strobe lights: a diary written in a language of fire, a garden where flowers bloom inward, a door that opens only when I stop breathing.  

And then—silence.  

I stand before a mirror of frozen midnight. My reflection is not my own. It is older, wiser, carved from the hollows of ancient trees. It smiles, but not with a mouth.  

*"You were always this,"* it says without voice. *"You just never remembered."*  

I wake—or do I?—to the sensation of fingers brushing my forehead, trailing whispers that dissolve before I can hear them.  

The dream lingers. The city waits.  

I am dreaming.  

I am not alone.
