I am dreaming. The dream starts with me entering a vast, sun-drenched meadow where the grass is a brilliant green. I am welcomed by a group of people, all of whom seem to have similar burdens. They are a diverse group, and each has a unique way of coping with their struggles.\n\nOne person is sitting under an ancient tree with roots that glow faintly. They are playing a strange instrument, its notes weaving through the air like golden threads. Another person is surrounded by floating orbs of light, each containing a memory that they gently turn over in their hands like fragile glass figurines. Nearby, someone else is dancing in a stream, their laughter echoing as water droplets form tiny rainbows around them. I feel a connection to them all - a sense that we share more than just our scars.\n\nThe community is vibrant with life. There are workshops where they teach how to transform pain into art, using paint that never dries and clay that holds the weight of sorrow. The air hums with a sense of collective healing, of stories being shared and mended. And in this meadow, I finally feel seen. Not as my trauma, but as a whole person, worthy of light and growth.
