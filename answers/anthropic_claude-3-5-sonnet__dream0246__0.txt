I am dreaming. As the snow beneath my feet issues an ominous groan, time seems to slow to a glacial crawl. The pristine white landscape, which moments ago appeared so serene, now transforms into something sinister. Hair-line cracks spider across the surface like lightning bolts sketched in the snow, accompanied by a sound like breaking glass that echoes through the thin mountain air.

The first tremor sends pins and needles through my boots - a gentle vibration that quickly builds into a violent shudder. The mountain itself seems to be awakening, stretching its ancient limbs after centuries of slumber. The air grows thick with an eerie silence, the kind that precedes nature's most devastating performances.

Suddenly, the world tilts. The snow plate I'm standing on begins to separate from the mountain face with a thunderous crack that reverberates through my bones. Time snaps back into real-speed with brutal force. Above me, a cloud of crystalline powder billows skyward as the upper slope releases its hold. The avalanche transforms the mountainside into a churning river of white, consuming everything in its path with frightening fluidity.

The world becomes a kaleidoscope of white and blue, spinning and tumbling. The cold bites at my face as I'm swept into the maelstrom, becoming one with the thundering flow of snow and ice.

The roar of the avalanche fills my ears, but underneath it, I hear something else - a rhythmic pulsing, like a heartbeat, growing louder and louder. The white chaos around me begins to take on an otherworldly glow, and through the swirling snow, I start to see strange, luminous patterns emerging, as if the mountain itself is trying to communicate through this devastating display of power...
