I am dreaming. You stand in a fractal forest, its trees spiraling upward in impossible geometries, their bark iridescent like oil on water. The air hums with whispers that aren’t voices but pulses of color—cobalt vibrations when you inhale, burnt orange when you exhale. Below your feet, the ground shifts between velvet moss and liquid glass, reflecting a sky clotted with constellations you’ve never seen: stars arranged in the shape of scars, birthmarks, the jagged edges of half-forgotten memories.  

The trigger arrives as a thorned vine—obsidian and serrated—that thrusts from the earth to spear your palm. Pain blooms electric, acidic, *personal*. Instinct screams to yank back, to howl, to let the sting flood your veins like wildfire. But in the split-second pause, you notice the blood pooling in your cupped hand isn’t red. It’s liquid mercury, glinting with images: a child’s abandoned kite snagged on barbed wire, a glacier calving into an alphabet of shattered vowels, a face you swear is yours but aged backward.  

A voice thrums from your sternum, deeper than your own: *“Burn the bridge, and the village on both shores burns with it.”* The words taste of charred cedar and salt. You exhale, and suddenly your wounded hand is no longer flesh but a mosaic—fragments of stained glass depicting galaxies, coral reefs, and clockwork hummingbirds. Each shard hums a different frequency. You flex your fingers, and symbols emerge in the air: an owl’s eye, a cracked hourglass, an open palm cradling a dying star.  

The forest responds. Trees bend like penitent monks, their canopies scattering pollen that crystallizes into tiny mirrors. In each reflection, you glimpse alternate choices: a version of you spitting curses as the thorn poisons their bloodstream, another dissolving into the soil to nourish neon fungi, another seizing the vine to braid it into a crown studded with black diamonds. But here, now, you simply turn your mosaic hand palm-up. The mercury-blood pools, quicksilver and patient, as the thorn retracts—transforming into a feather, then a key, then a moth with wings of stained glass.  

The air shivers. You take a breath flavored with lightning and jasmine. The dream holds its heartbeat, waiting. For the first time, you realize the forest’s true name: *Threshold*. And you are its scribe.
