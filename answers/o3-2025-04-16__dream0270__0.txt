I am dreaming. —I’m still half-asleep as I tell you this, so the colors keep leaking out of the edges of my words and pooling on the floor, but here goes:

I stood on the shore of something that wasn’t quite an ocean—imagine molten starlight swirling slow as honey, iridescent waves groaning like whales made of brass. I could feel the tide tugging at the marrow of my bones, as if it wanted to trade places with my blood. Every crest threw diamond-bright spray into the air, and each droplet hung there, refusing to fall, becoming tiny constellations that hummed in short, curious chords.

Behind me rose cliffs made of book spines—thousands of them—tilted sideways so their gilt titles flashed like reptile scales in the dawn. When the wind blew, the pages riffl ed themselves, and a sigh rolled across the shelves, an endless hush-hush-hush that smelled of ink, leather, and a bit of thunder. I knew, somehow, that if I opened any one of those volumes, the characters inside would spill out in flocks and swim off across the light-sea.

Up in the sky—or maybe beneath my feet; directions were drunk down there—the moon kept shedding its faces like masks at a masquerade. First a laughing silver jester, then a mourning widow in pewter, then a clockwork lion gnawing its own tail. Each mask, once discarded, drifted until it met one of those hovering star-drops; they’d fuse, spark, flare violet, and explode into perfumed snow. I caught a flake on my tongue: it tasted of childhood birthdays, fireplace smoke, and a single unpredictable tear.

There was music, but it didn’t come from anywhere. It was inside my teeth, vibrating through enamel—harps made of sunlight plucked by invisible fingers. Every note left a color on the air: low notes dragged slow burgundy across my vision; highs skittered lime-green like startled lizards. When a chord resolved, I felt a physical click, like a lock turning in the middle of my heart.

I tried to move, but every step rewound itself, as if the ground were editing my intentions. Instead, the world slid past me. Islands drifted by—one a cathedral of glass feathers, another a carnival wheel sewn entirely from moth wings. Atop a third stood an hourglass big as a mountain, its sand pouring upward. The grains were tiny golden words, and I could almost read them before they vanished into the bulb above.

Then came the clouds: huge, thunderous brains of storm, pulsing with thought. Lightning flashed inside, but the bolts were paragraphs, whole stories striking and branching. When they hit the sea of light the words sizzled, transforming into flocks of origami cranes that soared, unfolded, and became sheets of paper on which my own memories had been handwritten in some earlier century.

I wanted to tell you everything exactly as it happened, but describing it feels like trying to carve a hurricane into marble: I chip away, and all that remains is motionlessness. Even now the dream keeps thrumming behind my eyes, a private aurora I can’t quite translate. But if you close your lids and lean in, maybe you can hear the hush of winged pages, taste the warm metallic tang of star-spray, and feel, just for a moment, the pull of that impossible tide urging the galaxies inside you to rise, fall, and rise again.
