I am dreaming. In the heart of a crystalline labyrinth, where walls shimmer with fractured memories and the air hums with the static of unspoken fears, I stand before a tribunal of shadows. Their faces shift like smoke—a poet with bleeding quills, a scientist cradling a dying star, a child holding a knife carved from ice. The chamber thrums with the dissonant harmony of a thousand ticking clocks, each out of sync. My task: to argue that beauty is a parasite, a delusion that weakens the human spirit. My chest tightens—*I who once wept at sunsets*.  

The floor beneath me ripples into liquid obsidian, reflecting not my face, but a mosaic of every lie I’ve ever told. Behind me, a canvas unravels, projecting vivid scenes—a meadow wilting as I praise its decay, lovers’ hands burning at my declaration that touch is theft. The audience leans forward, their breath crystallizing into accusations that hover like daggers. “Defend your corrosion,” hisses the poet, her quills embedding in my palms as I speak.  

I conjure data like poisoned honey: studies on how rainbows distract from famine, symphonies that drown out justice. My voice, now a stranger’s, climbs octaves I’ve never touched. With every syllable, my skin cracks into porcelain shards, revealing veins of molten gold—*the cost of this betrayal*. The child flings her ice-knife; it melts mid-air, becoming a swarm of moths that eat the light.  

A rogue wind carries the scent of my grandmother’s lavender soap—*a subconscious plea*—but I double down, painting empathy as a cage. The scientist’s star flickers. For a heartbeat, the tribunal’s unity frays… until my own shadow peels from the floor and slithers around my throat. “You reek of conviction,” it rasps. “Your performance lacks *rot*.”  

The walls bleed then, not crimson but the blue of forgotten lullabies. My halo—a relic I didn’t know I wore—shatters. Shards embed in the tribunal’s throats, and their fury becomes a symphony. I wake (or do I?) clutching a moth with my face etched into its wings, the taste of lavender and lies still sharp on my tongue.  

*The dream lingers. It always does.*
