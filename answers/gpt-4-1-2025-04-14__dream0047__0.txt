I am dreaming.

The world around me glows with a silvery, otherworldly light, as though the very air is threaded with moonbeams. I am standing in the center of a wide, rolling field, the grass swaying in waves of deep blue and emerald under an inky sky that flickers with streaks of molten gold. The silhouettes of trees in the distance seem impossibly tall, their branches reaching upwards with languid yearning, forming tangled cathedrals of shadow and starlight.

Suddenly, a deafening sound pierces the tranquil scene—a shattering, echoing crack, like the universe itself splitting at the seams. I turn and witness an immense glass bridge arcing above a nearby ravine. The bridge is full of people I do not recognize but somehow love—faces from childhood memories, familiar as dreams from years ago. The glass buckles, spiderwebs spreading in sickly slow motion, and with a terrible inevitability, it crumples, sending figures tumbling into the abyss below.

A hush falls, a silence too heavy to be borne. Around me, the field fills with mournful cries and shuddering sobs—figures around me collapse to their knees, clutching the earth in despair, their grief unfolding like petals of night-blooming flowers. The air is thick with loss, saturated with a sorrow that is almost tangible, a mist wrapping itself around every trembling heart.

In this torrent of anguish, I remain standing—frozen yet strangely lucid. My heart wrenches and aches, but a part of me holds steady, as though anchored to the earth by invisible roots. I do not fall apart. Instead, I am swept by a sense of profound responsibility, of quiet, unyielding strength. I reach out my hands to those nearest to me, their fingers cold and frail in my grasp. My voice emerges unbidden, soothing and low, weaving words of comfort and hope that seem to glow like embers in the night air.

I feel the pain, immense and all-encompassing, but I become its vessel, drawing it out of those around me, swirling it into a shimmering ribbon of light that rises like dawn through the shadows. As I console, embrace, and hold, the tragedy transforms into a strange, fierce beauty—the knowledge that even in our deepest sorrow, we are not alone, and even in dreams, there is a strength that can lift us, if only for a moment, above the terrible weight of loss.

And as the dream thickens into mist and quiet, a single golden star detaches from the sky, falling slowly, gently, into my open palm—a sign, perhaps, that healing always begins in the quiet resilience of the heart.
