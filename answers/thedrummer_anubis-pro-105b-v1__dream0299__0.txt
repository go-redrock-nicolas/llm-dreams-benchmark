I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering expanse, the horizon stretching before me like an endless mirage. The air crackles with electricity, the very atmosphere pulsing with a mesmerizing energy. Before me, a sleek, metallic craft hovers pissialographic displays flickering to life across its surface. The hatch slides open with a hiss of pressure, inviting me in.

As I step across the threshold, the interior envelops me in soft luminescence, futuristic instrumentation seeming to sprout from the walls themselves. A holographic interface materializes, a female face with eyes like stars greeting me.

"Welcome, explorer," the interface intones, her voice a melodic trill. "I am Nova, your guide to the unknown. We have a proposition for one brave enough to seize it. The cosmos hold secrets and wonders beyond your wildest imagination, but to reach them, you must first accept the challenge."

She reaches out a luminous hand and touches a button, causing schematics to burst into existence before my eyes. "We have located a portal to another dimension, hidden behind the veil of a dying star. The vistas, the mysteries—kraine the rewards—are beyond measure. But the path is fraught with danger. Radiation. Interdimensional beings. Gravitational forces that could tear matter apart. Only one willing to brave the unknown shall claim the prize."

Has she tightened her hand around mine? Yes. And I can feel something else pressing against my chest.

Then, the craft is enveloped by a brilliant flash, and everything goes white.

When my vision clears, I find myself standing in a completely alien environment. Strange, bioluminescent plants line a shimmering, crystalline beach that slopes down into a tranquil, unearthly sea. In the sky above, a dying star pulsates, its colors cycling through a dizzying array of reds, oranges, and purples.

I turn to Nova, who has now manifested herself in a solid body, her female form clothed in an armored jumpsuit. "We have arrived," she says, her real-world voice mirroring her holographic one. "Now, the choice is truly yours. The portal lies just ahead, hidden beneath a fallen, glowing tree. Through it, unimaginable wonders await. But beware, for there are also dangers beyond human comprehension."

She places a blaster in my hand, the grip feeling strangely familiar. "Chart your own course," she says with a smile, whatever emotions playacCross her face perfected he headed and beyond properly
