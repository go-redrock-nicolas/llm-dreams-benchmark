I am dreaming. Suddenly, I find myself in a vast, infinite landscape, surreal yet strangely familiar. The sky above is a swirling canvas of deep purples and vivid crimsons, like a bruise spreading across the heavens. In the distance, towering obsidian spires pierce the sky, their shapes shifting and morphing like smoke.

As I take our first steps, the ground beneath me transforms from smooth obsidian to soft, lush green grass, warm and welcoming against my bare feet. A gentle breeze caresses my skin, carrying with it the sweet scent of night-blooming jasmine.

Before me stretches a winding path, lined on either side by ancient, gnarled trees. Their branches reach out like welcoming arms, leaves shimmering in iridescent hues of gold and silver. As I pass, the leaves whisper stories, secrets and wisdom of eons past.

The whispering leaves speak of the support network, a sanctuary for those in crisis. As the breeze parts the foliage, I see it - a glimmering obsidian oasis, constructed from the same material as the distant spires.

The air inside is thick with the comforting scent of wasabi, coconut and iron, grounding, and reassuring me as someone almost communicated, needing help. 

But before I can step into the sanctuary, a seismic tremor rumbles beneath me, and the landscape begins to shift. The once welcoming trees sprout razor-sharp thorns, their branches becoming gnarled and gnarled, clawing at the sky. The grass beneath my feet hardens, becoming a mirror that reflects not my own image, but the twisted, nightmarish visage of the person in crisis, their anguish and pain etched into the very surface of the world.

A cold wind howls through the landscape, keening with the sorrow and despair of a thousand lost souls. Shadows lengthen and coalesce, forming a monstrous, shifting figure that lunges at me with razor-sharp claws.

I scream for help, but my voice is snatched away by the wind. The mirror beneath my feet cracks, and I find myself falling, plummeting down into an abyss of darkness and despair.

As I fall, I see flashes of the person in crisis - their pain, their fear, their desperate need for help. And then, in a moment of clarity, I realize that I am not their savior. I am a vessel, a conduit for their pain and suffering. I am the one who will bear the burden of their crisis.

I reach out, grabbing hold of nothing but empty air as I plummet deeper into the darkness. And then, suddenly, I am awake, my heart pounding in my chest as I gasp for breath.

I look around, disoriented and confused, wondering if any of it was real. But as I reach for my phone to check on the person in crisis, I know deep down that some part of me will always carry a piece of their sorrow with me forever.

I am changed, but I am also stronger. I am a vessel, a conduit for the pain and suffering of others. And though the weight of it may be heavy, I know that I will never be alone in bearing that burden.

I am part of something greater than myself, a network of souls bound together by shared experience and unwavering compassion. Together, we will face the darkness and emerge triumphant, smarts and determined to help others find their way back to the light.
