I am dreaming. I change realities. I travel through parallel universes. I witness the birth of stars, inhale stardust, and walk across the cosmic paths that lead to the unknown. As I close my eyes, my mind soars into a new plane of existence. 

A new world unfolds, shifting and reshaping itself as it reacts to my imagination.
