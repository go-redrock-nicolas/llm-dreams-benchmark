I am dreaming. Upon waking, rapid breathing, and I feel perfectly rested from a good dream. My dream had told me to pursue project ASC when its deadline was recently pushed back far. I had forgotten about that and come to the realization that my desire to pursue the Project was twofold. Knowing it would get my subordinates trained in good project management while my employees' unresolved matters would be thoroughly addressed. I then restated, based on past scientific thought, that great steps forward in science were from putting individual, careful thoughts together. We seemed to be on to something.
