I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in the middle of a sprawling glass-walled atrium, where early-morning sunlight glitters across sleek tabletops piled high with glossy folders. Below your feet, the polished marble floor seems to shift and ripple like water, yet when you look more closely, it remains firm. An impossible hush blankets the space, as though every sound is muffled and distant—except for the voices of your two colleagues.

They face one another across a wide, curved desk, tense glares passing between them like sparks of static electricity. One colleague is short and stocky, wearing a charcoal-grey suit that hints at a no-nonsense attitude; the other is tall and wiry, dressed in a sky-blue blazer that seems almost too cheery for the gloom on his face. Papers litter the desk between them, scattered in piles that threaten to topple over as they gesture in agitation.

“The timeline is impossible,” the short colleague huffs, throwing his hands into the air. “There's no way we complete this by the end of the quarter without burning everyone out. We need to push the deadline.” His voice trembles with frustration, but there’s an anxious undertone that suggests he's worried beyond the usual stress.

The tall colleague’s eyes narrow. “We promised results. Compromising now would show weakness—like we’re admitting failure!” He slams a hand on the desk, causing the top sheet to flutter to the floor and vanish into the swirling reflections beneath your feet.

You notice that the entire atrium, which had seemed so expansive, is now contracting around you. The glass walls creep closer, the corners warping into curved lines, making the room resemble a colossal fishbowl. The air becomes thick, each breath both chilly and damp, as if an invisible fog has rolled in. You can hear your own pulse in your ears.

Suddenly, both colleagues whirl to you, eyes filled with urgency. “Whose side are you on?” the tall colleague demands, voice echoing strangely—as if it’s traveling across a vast canyon. The short colleague steps forward, his expression desperate. “We value your judgment—tell us, who is right?”

You glance between them. Their faces are cast in molten morning light, dancing shadows that reveal how wound up and vulnerable they are. It strikes you that this project has significance beyond the day-to-day demands of the workplace—there is a sense that success here means something transcendent, while failure would drag them (and you) into a deep, unknown darkness.

Time slows, allowing you to see the faint reflection of your own face in the shimmery floor. Something in your chest flutters, equal parts empathy and dread. You feel compelled to help, but the words you choose might fracture everything. You step closer, taking a deep breath of that heavy air and tasting electricity on your tongue. Then you speak:

“Neither of you is completely wrong, and neither is entirely right,” you begin, voice resonating with a reassuring calm. “We need to blend the practicality of adjusting the timeline with the ambition that drives us to deliver results. We can extend certain milestones without losing the momentum that inspires everyone to push forward. Find a middle path—one that respects our well-being and respects our promises.”

In your dream, your words carry an unearthly weight. As soon as you utter them, the swirling reflections in the glass slow, and the floor beneath your feet stabilizes. You behold your colleagues as they lower their gazes in unison, each digesting your proposal with relief flickering in their eyes. The tension in the atrium evaporates like a fog burning off in the sun. The walls glide outward again, restoring the sense of airy spaciousness and possibility. Even the papers on the desk neatly reorder themselves, as if a breeze of unity has rearranged them into tidier stacks.  

Your two colleagues exchange a look—tentative, yet hopeful—and nod. The thick hush breaks, replaced by a gentle hum of optimism that courses through the scintillating glass panels overhead. The project, once on the brink of collapse, is saved through this middle ground. A sense of hesitant peace settles into your chest, making you feel strangely weightless, as though you could ascend through that vaulted ceiling and soar among the golden rays.

Then, as dreams do, the entire scene dissolves. The glass panels tremble, the marble floor liquefies, and the carefully stacked folders whirl into a turquoise vortex. For a moment, you hover at the perimeter, taking in the surreal spectacle. You feel your eyelids flutter, the dream teetering on the brink of wakefulness. And in the final, trembling heartbeat of sleep, you sense a profound sense of balance—like this project, and all of you embarking on it, might just turn out victorious after all.
