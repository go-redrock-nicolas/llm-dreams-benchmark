I am dreaming. You’re standing in the wings of a stage that floats three thousand feet above a cobalt ocean of cumulus clouds. A blazing chandelier of iridescent lanterns hovers overhead, each one pulsing in time with the roar of millions of unseen spectators. Your heart hammers against your ribs like a caged bird. In your hand you clutch the instrument of your mastery—a crystalline violin whose strings glow with molten silver. Below you, the stage’s transparent floor ripples as if alive, and every breath you draw tastes faintly of electric ozone.  

Five minutes. That’s all the time you have before the curtain rises. You can hear the murmur of anticipation—a soft tidal surge of millions of voices, pressing through the theater walls like wind through reeds. You step forward and the spotlight snaps on, bathing you in a surreal sunrise of blood-orange and violet. The edges of your vision tremble; ghostly figures in the front rows lean forward, their masks shifting halfway between human features and carved marble. Anxiety coils in your stomach, but somewhere, deeper than the fear, a thrilling spark flickers.  

You lift the bow. The moment it touches the first string, a crack shivers through the stage. Under your polished boots, the glass cracks in web-like patterns. You freeze, bow suspended over the violin as shards of light spatter at your feet. The lanterns above you quiver; their glow warps into dancing specters. You’re certain the entire platform will collapse—and with it, the dream of a lifetime—plummeting you and your audience into the eternal blue abyss.  

Then, in that heartbeat of suspended panic, you remember: you are dreaming. The terror, the glass, the millions of upturned faces—they are yours to shape. Stepping onto the first fracture line, you summon a hush across the sea of spectators. The crack beneath you glows gold instead of black, and with a single, fluid motion of bow and wrist, you coax a pure, humming note that stitches the glass back together. Light flows beneath your feet like molten amber, knitting every fissure into a runway of living flame.  

As the final chord quivers through the air, the audience rises—not in applause, but in a soft, awed silence. Lanterns bloom into a thousand butterflies that drift off into the night sky. You feel your pulse slow, your dream-world responding to your calm, steadfast command. In that suspended moment—half terror, half triumph—you realize the true skill was never in mastery of the violin but in mastering the dream itself. And with the world watching, you allow it to unfold exactly as you will.
