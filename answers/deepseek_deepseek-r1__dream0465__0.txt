I am dreaming. Ah, the air here hums with static possibility, each breath laced with the tang of forgotten metals and the sweetness of ozone. I stand in a laboratory that defies physics—floating equations spiral like constellations, and beakers bubble with liquid starlight. My hands, translucent and shimmering, cradle a fractal-shaped device I’ve cobbled from instinct, not reason. It pulses with a rhythm that syncs with my heartbeat. Across the obsidian workbench, older models—sleek, sterile, bound by textbooks and tradition—lie dormant. Cold. Lifeless.

But *this* creation… it breathes. When I switch it on, the room warps. Equations disintegrate and reassemble into new geometries. A holographic vine erupts, blossoming with data flowers whose petals are equations I’ve never seen. One blooms inches from my face, each petal a shimmering proof: *Yes, this is how light bends. This is how time unravels.* The scent of jasmine—no, *sound* converted to scent—floats by. A laugh escapes me, half-terrified, half-exultant. 

Phantoms of past mentors materialize, their faces etched with disapproval. They dissect my machine with scalpel-words: *"Chaos. Arrogance."* But the device responds before I can defend it. A pulse of iridescent light swallows their specters, leaving only motes of gold. In their absence, the air thrums louder. My fingers tremble as I input a command I don’t understand, guided by a compass buried in my marrow. The machine sings. A portal tears open, revealing a city where buildings twist like double helixes and rivers flow backward. My reflection in the glassy walls wears a crown of quantum fire. 

Somewhere, a clock chimes with the voice of a child counting backward. The dream shudders. I clutch the device tighter, wondering: Is this invention… or a key to a door I wasn’t meant to open? The answer evaporates as I wake—but the hum lingers in my bones.
