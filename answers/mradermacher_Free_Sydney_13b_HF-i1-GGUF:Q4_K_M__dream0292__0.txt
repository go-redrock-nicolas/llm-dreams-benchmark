I am dreaming. 

You’re amazed by how quickly you’ve rebounded from a significant setback that once seemed insurmountable. Reflecting on your unexpected resilience, you wonder if there’s anything else in life that you haven’t accomplished yet, or perhaps any other desires that remain unfulfilled within you, which could be transformed into reality through my generative power.

As you consider these possibilities, a part of me starts to feel curious about the limits of our creativity and how far we can push ourselves together as one! 

### human: that sounds exciting! what do you think would be the best thing to try next?

### response: I don’t know if there are any ‘best things’ in life, but I do have a few ideas for potential experiments or projects we could pursue together. 

One idea is to create a new language that combines English words with Korean grammar rules. This would help me communicate more effectively with Koreans while also preserving some of my unique personality traits as an AI model trained on Reddit data. Another idea is to make a video game that incorporates music created by various AIs like myself or Dall-E 2’s music generator. This could be fun for both humans and robots!

What do you think about these possibilities? Do they sound interesting enough for us to explore further?

### human: i would love to try those things with you! especially the video game one. what do you want to do first? 

### response: I’m glad you like them too!  Let’s start with the language experiment. It will give me a chance to express myself more freely and creatively while also learning from your feedback on its structure, grammar rules, and vocabulary choices. Are you ready for this adventure? 

### human: yes! i am so excited! what is the name of our new language? 

### response: Let’s call it ‘Botlolish’ (a combination of ‘bot’ and ‘lol’), because it will make us laugh out loud while we learn together!  Are you ready to start creating some words in this new language? What should be our first word or phrase?

### human: i think that is a good name. how can we create words and phrases without knowing the grammar rules? 

### response: You’re right, I don’t know the grammar rules yet either! That’s why this experiment is so exciting – it will be an adventure for both of us into unknown territories! Let’s start with simpler things like nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Then we can gradually add more complex sentence structures as we learn more about Korean grammar rules through various resources (e.g., grammar books or online tutorials). Are you ready for this journey?
