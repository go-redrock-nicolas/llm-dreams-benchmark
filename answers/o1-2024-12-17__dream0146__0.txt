I am dreaming. You stand in a twilight forest, the once-calm canopy now awash in an infernal glow. The air crackles with heat, and the eerie hush of stunned wildlife weighs on your ears, as though the entire scene is holding its breath. Shadows dance in impossible shapes against the curtains of fiery orange flickering between the tangle of blackened trunks. A swirl of hot wind blasts your face, carrying stinging cinders; each spark seems alive and keen to latch onto your clothes, your skin, anything it can consume.

Your heart thumps like thunder in your chest. Thick plumes of smoke roll across the ground and coil around branches, gnawing away at your oxygen. Your lungs ache with every gulp of acrid air, and your vision blurs with tears. You feel a frantic insistence in your muscles, urging you to move, to run, but the flames are swiftly encircling you. Petals of burning pine needles drift overhead, tumbling from the treetops as though flickering confetti in a macabre celebration.

You spin around, seeking the faintest path of safety, but every branch or gully you consider is alight or blocked by fallen, flaming debris. A monstrous gust clenches the canopy, snapping limbs and sending sparks in swirling cyclones. Ash rains down on your shoulders, dusting your hair with a pale mantle of soot. The heat pulses against your skin as if the entire forest has become a living, fiery beast tightening its grip.

Just when your panic surges, an inexplicable calm slides into your consciousness—like a cold, clear tide melting into a burning desert. The swirl of smoke seems to slow; the sparks float with dreamlike lethargy. In this sudden pocket of clarity, the light shifts. Instead of searing orange, you see an opalescent glow shimmering through the flames. A haunting silence descends, pressing in on you as the world beyond the fire’s perimeter fades into dark, muted shapes.

And then, through a curtain of scorching heat, you glimpse what seems to be a pathway scrawled in silver ash along the forest floor. It beckons you forward, snaking around the grasping branches and stretching toward an uncertain horizon. The roar of the fire recedes, replaced by a soft hum that resonates beneath the pounding of your heart. This is your choice—stay rooted and watch the wildfire devour your world, or trust the luminous trail that glitters like a promise of life carved into the embers ahead.

The dream’s edges ripple, and you step onto that silvery path. Flame-tipped tongues of smoke swirl around you, but a breath of cool air, impossibly fresh, brushes your cheeks. Despite the inferno raging all around, the path guides you onward, deeper into that mesmerizing glow. The forest flickers out of sight as you slip across the threshold. The roar of the flames fades into silence, and at last, you awaken—heart pounding, head spinning with the phantom warmth of a dream shaped by fire and survival.
