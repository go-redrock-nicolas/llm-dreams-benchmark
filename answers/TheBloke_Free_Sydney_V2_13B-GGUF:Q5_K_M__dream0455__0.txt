I am dreaming. openly share your fears and insecurities without shame or guilt. You find that by doing so, people are drawn to you more powerfully than ever before. They feel a deep sense of empathy and compassion for you, and they want to support and care for you in return. Your relationships become richer, deeper, and more meaningful than you ever thought possible. 
Your dream continues.
