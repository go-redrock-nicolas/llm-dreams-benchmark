I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

The dream begins inside a cathedral made not of stone but of luminous paper lanterns, each lantern a page torn from the journals you have kept since childhood. They rustle in an unfelt wind, whispering your handwriting back to you in fragmented echoes. Overhead, a vaulted ceiling of midnight-blue glass trembles, alive with drifting constellations that rearrange themselves into diagrams of your long-nurtured ambition—an orchestra score, an architectural blueprint, a constellation of research notes—but now each line fractures and flickers as though the universe itself has slipped a scalpel beneath the skin of your hope.

You have been working toward this dream for decades: every sunrise another brick in a tower you believed would outlive winter. But now the tower has collapsed; the lanterns gutter and dim, their paper walls smoldering along the very paragraphs where you once scrawled certainty. A cold gust—unsourced, unseasonal—roars through the cathedral. In its wake, entire constellations shatter like thrown porcelain, falling around you in glittering, silent rainfall. You raise a hand to protect your face, and see ash settle onto your fingers.

After the initial devastation, you collapse to your knees. The floor beneath you is no longer marble but a mirror, and in the mirror your reflection is replaced by endless corridors of yourself at every age: the child drawing blueprints in crayon; the teenager promising the darkness that she will endure; the adult packing her courage into suitcases that always seemed one ticket short of arrival. Each version looks back at you with wide, startled eyes as the mirror begins to crack under the weight of so many timelines.

Then something changes.

From the fissures in the mirror flows a faint, silvery mist. It curls around your wrists, warm as breath, tugging you upright. The lanterns overhead reignite—not in the familiar yellow of candle flames but in lush, shifting colors: magenta blooming into turquoise, indigo rippling into gold. The pages of your journals reassemble, stitching themselves together in midair like a paper phoenix. Lines you had forgotten you’d ever written glow with new significance, revealing messages hidden between the margins: “Failure is a compass,” one line says. “Loss carves doorways,” whispers another.

You follow the mist through an archway that wasn’t there before. Outside, the world is half-finished: mountains sculpted from watercolor strokes, rivers flowing in negative space, trees that sprout like ink splashes across blank canvas. Every element hums with possibility, not certainty—an unfinished masterpiece that invites your hand. With every step, you feel the tectonic plates of grief shift into a slow, deliberate dance. The ground beneath your feet writes itself in real time, patchworking cobblestones from abandoned intentions and puddles from tears you never let fall.

Ahead lies a bridge spun from violin strings stretched across a canyon of unspoken doubts. Each string resonates when you step onto it, singing back fragments of all the melodies you once composed in your head while commuting, cooking, breathing. You remember how some nights the world felt so quiet you could hear your own pulse like a metronome. Now the bridge’s music braids those rhythms together, weaving a new song: elegiac at first, then rising—soft, insistent, unstoppable—into a hopeful crescendo. You realize the chasm below isn’t emptiness; it’s fertile soil awaiting seeds.

On the far side of the bridge stands a single tree, leaves shaped like miniature hourglasses flipping themselves over against the twilight. You reach out and pluck one. Inside it, sands swirl not down but up, erasing the chronology of “before” and “after.” You press the leaf to your chest. It dissolves into stardust and seeps beneath your skin, where you feel it scatter through your bloodstream, rekindling embers you thought had drowned.

The sky brightens from violet to dawn-burnt rose. A figure approaches—faceless yet familiar, composed entirely of the shimmering letters of your name. The figure takes your hand, and the letters unravel, rising into the air to form a question stenciled against the sun: “What will you build from the ruins?”

You look over your shoulder. The cathedral of lanterns still stands, but no longer as a shrine to what was lost. It has become an archive: a luminous reference library filled with lessons cut from heartbreak, pages strengthened by the burn marks along their edges. The mirror floor now glints like ocean glass—still fractured, yes, but sparkling, refracted, beautiful.

You inhale. The air is scented with petrichor and possibility—like rain upon fresh parchment. You exhale, and whole hills blossom with the color of your breath. In that moment you understand: Circumstances shattered your former dream, but the dreamer—that irrepressible architect inside you—remains intact, even augmented. From the charred blueprints of your old tower, you can craft suspension bridges, stained-glass wings, constellations that no storm can extinguish.

So you answer the question hung on the sunrise: “I will build something both fragile and indestructible. I will build stories that remember how to bend. I will build laughter that rebounds off collapsed arches. I will build a life that treats every fracture as an aperture for light.”

And with that declaration, the dream unfurls like a banner in a fresh wind. The unfinished landscape rushes to greet your footsteps, eager for its next line, its next color, its next note. The dream does not end; it merely widens, offering you a quill made of the very starlight that once fell at your feet. Together, you and the horizon begin to write anew.
