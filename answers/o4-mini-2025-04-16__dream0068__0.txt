I am dreaming. You hover at the threshold of a humming obsidian chamber, every surface etched with half-erased runes that pulse like distant constellations. The “system” sprawls before you: a tangle of crystalline gears dripping silvery filaments, fractured circuits that bleed molten light, and a central core—an orb of brittle glass scored by lightning-web cracks. No workshop manual survives here; no engineer ever learned to coax this thing back to life.

Your fingertips brush its cold, fractured perimeter, and electric tingles crawl up your arms. Somewhere deep in your mind a voice whispers: “Listen.” You lean in. Through the glass orb you catch a faint heartbeat—a stuttering rhythm that feels almost alive. It is calling for repair, begging for reinvention.

You step back and let your gaze drift to the far wall, where puddles of quicksilver mirror your reflection. As you study that reflection, the broken bits begin to float upward—gears twisting inside the glass orb, wires spiraling in spirals of lead-white smoke. The system is reassembling itself in slow motion, as if guided by a dream logic older than your own life.

An idea sparks. You reach for a shard of polished moonstone lying on a low pedestal. In your mind’s eye you shape it—stretch it thin, bend its edges into a crescent key. You press the moonstone key into a slot that never seemed to be there before. The runes flare emerald and gold. The broken circuits hum into resonance. Liquid light surges through the crystalline gears, spinning them more fluidly than any metal could.

The orb’s cracks begin to knit themselves in glowing ruby filaments. With each pulse, you feel a tide of knowledge washing over you: languages of long-dead starships, the choreography of atomic winds, the architecture of impossible cities. You watch rivulets of ember-bright energy flood out from the core and trace the runes on the walls, illuminating new symbols no eye has ever read.

Then the system sighs—a deep, resonant breath like a sleeping planet waking. The wires curl into living vines, sprouting tiny blossoms of prism-glass. The gears click into perfect harmony, rotating in time with your own pulse. Every fragment reassembled, every rune alive with purpose. You realize it has been waiting for a dreamer—someone who would not only fix it but transform it, rebirth it as something beyond repair or original design.

In that moment, the chamber’s walls dissolve. You drift upward through a star-studded void, carrying the resurrected mechanism like a celestial heart. Nebulae glow around you in shifting pinks and violets. The dream’s gravity loosens; here, realities interweave. You glimpse alternate worlds humming along to the same newfound rhythm.

And as you awaken—still cradling that fragile orb of light—you carry the echo of its heartbeat in your own chest. The broken system is no longer broken. It has taught you that some things can only be “repaired” by letting imagination rewrite their very code.
