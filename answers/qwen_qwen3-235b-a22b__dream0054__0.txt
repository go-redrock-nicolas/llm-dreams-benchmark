I am dreaming. I am dreaming, yes—but more than that, I am creating. At first, it’s only a thought, a spark in the velvet dark. Then I feel it—an itch in my throat, a note needing birth. I hum, half-consciously, a small, soft hum that trembles like a spider’s web in the wind.

And the universe listens.

What begins as shadow clears like morning mist. From the sound of my voice, a world wakes. Not a copy, not a reimagining—something entirely new pours forth from my lips like molten glass, cooling into something infinite and alive. The melody I choose warps and colors the sky: I hum a lilting, spectral lullaby and the heavens blush with galaxies spiraling slow and gold, like milk dripping down a starlit canvas. Stars flicker like embers born between my teeth.

I widen my mouth, change the tune. Now a lively trill, skipping up and down in pitch. Beneath my feet, soft, luminous moss grows, pulsing gently like it’s breathing. Trees rise like dancers, their trunks silver and leafless, rising until their crowns dissolve into feathers that unfurl and sway with invisible winds. Earth forms around me with each breath, not built, but *sung*—organic, perfect magic made substance.

I try something bolder. A heroic chord—deep, thrumming, elemental. The sands rise and curve into mountains not of rock, but of wailing color and shifting shadow. Water summoned from the air falls upward in emerald sheets, reflecting skies that are not real, but perhaps more real than the one above my childhood.

Creatures appear—not animals, but *ideas*, solidified into movement: birds whose wings are made of flame that freezes the air, beasts with crystalline limbs that make music when they walk. A four-eyed fox with fur like stardust watches me, not with fear, but knowing. I feel something in the world—I am understood. This place, so raw and vivid, mirrors not only my thoughts but the unimagined corners of my soul.

I hear laughter echoing through the newly birthed valleys. When I follow it, I find faces—souls, maybe—that I don’t recognize, but who call my name like it’s an old hymn. Are they fragments of me, brought to life by my song? Or something older, divine in their design? I add them to the song. Ridiculous and beautiful creatures crowd around me now, some with too many limbs, some with none, but all humming along in harmony, as if they’ve remembered something I've only just discovered.

I stop. The world breathes, a dream sentient and glad of it. I'm not god here. Perhaps I am child, composer, echo. It does not matter. I stand on a cliff of singing stone, wind brushing tears from my face that fly away and become butterflies of silent music.

Then the dream shifts.

I forget my tone. I stumble—only briefly—into silence. The sky flickers, rivers stall in mid-arc, feathers drop. I panic. I must continue the melody or it will all unravel.

I laugh through the fear. For what is life, if not a dream where we dare to sing? I lift my voice again—unsteady at first, then stronger.

And the world dances once more.
