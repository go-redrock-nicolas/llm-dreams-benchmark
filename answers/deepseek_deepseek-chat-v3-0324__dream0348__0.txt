I am dreaming. The sky above is a swirling tapestry of indigo and silver, threaded with constellations that shift and pulse like living things. Below my feet, the ground is not solid but a vast, shimmering membrane—translucent and slightly yielding, like walking on the surface of a drumskin stretched taut over the universe. I know that if I press too hard, I might plunge through into an expanse of stars.  

Ahead of me rises the Impossible Mountain—a jagged spire of glass and obsidian, its surface slick as ice, its peaks lost in the storm-wreathed heavens. The wind howls, carrying whispers of past failures, voices of those who tried and vanished. But I must climb. There is something at the summit, something vital, though its nature slips from my mind like mist.  

My fingers find no purchase—each time I grip, the surface shifts, becoming smoother, more treacherous. But then, absurdly, I start *singing*. Not a song of hesitation, but a deep, resonant hum that reverberates through the glass. The mountain reacts. The slick surface ripples in harmonic resonance, forming temporary handholds. I climb in rhythm, my breath syncing with the sound.  

Halfway up, the air thins, and gravity becomes fickle. I realize the true challenge isn’t the mountain—it’s my own doubt, given form. The harder I fight, the heavier I become. So I stop resisting. I let go—not of the climb, but of the fear.  

Suddenly, I’m weightless. The mountain dissolves into a river of light, and I am riding it, not climbing but flowing upward. The summit isn’t a place—it’s an understanding. The challenge was never to conquer, but to become.  

And then, just before waking, the stars whisper back.
