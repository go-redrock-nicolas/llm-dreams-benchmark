I am dreaming. I am standing in a vast, cavernous office that stretches endlessly in all directions, its walls lined with towering stacks of paper, teetering precariously like ancient monoliths. The air hums with the static of a hundred flickering computer screens, their blue glow casting eerie reflections on the polished floor. My desk—if it can even be called a desk—is a sprawling, labyrinthine structure, covered in sticky notes that flutter like autumn leaves in a nonexistent breeze.  

Every time I complete a task, three more materialize in its place, sprouting from the keyboard like digital weeds. The deadlines loom above me, not as numbers on a screen but as colossal, ticking clock faces embedded in the sky, their hands spinning faster with each passing second. The air grows thick, pressing against my chest, as though the weight of unfinished work has taken physical form.  

Then, the ground trembles. Leadership—faceless figures in sharp, shadowy suits—descends from the ceiling, floating like specters. Their voices overlap, a chorus of urgency: *"This is top priority. Drop everything. Why isn’t this done yet?"* With each demand, another stack of files crashes onto my desk, the impact sending tremors through my bones. My chair sinks into the floor, the ground turning viscous, like quicksand made of unfinished spreadsheets.  

I reach for my coffee—a lifeline—but the mug stretches away, elongating like a reflection in a funhouse mirror. The liquid inside swirls, black and infinite, and when I try to sip, the rim recedes endlessly. My keyboard melts under my fingers, keys dripping like wax, letters smearing into gibberish.  

A shrill alarm blares—*is it a notification? A fire alarm?*—but the sound warps, becoming the distant scream of a tea kettle left boiling for too long. The walls pulse, breathing in and out, and the ceiling yawns open, revealing a storm of paper swirling in a vortex. I am lifted, weightless, into the whirlwind of tasks, each sheet whispering a different demand as they brush against my skin.  

Just as the chaos reaches its peak, I wake—heart pounding, fingers clutching at the sheets—but the echo of that endless office lingers, the phantom weight of deadlines still pressing against my shoulders.
