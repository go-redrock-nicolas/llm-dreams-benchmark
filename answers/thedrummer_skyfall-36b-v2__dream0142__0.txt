I am dreaming. The dream takes me to a surreal, gleaming laboratory under a dark starry sky filled with of tumescent aerosols. I stand before an enormous, humming machine, its surface a mirrored black, and I am supervising an experimental procedure of great import. The air is thick with tension and anticipation.

Suddenly, the instruments around me begin to flicker and sputter. Alarms blare as they output contradictory readings - temperatures skyrocketing one moment, plummeting the next. Pressure gauges spin wildly, and Geiger counters emit staticky cackles.

I realize with growing unease that I am the only one here. No lab techs, no scientists - just me and this behemoth machine, rotating and gravid with power. The mirrored surface begins to mist with condensation, and then shudders with a low base rumble. 

Panic rising in my throat, I rush to the control panel, fingers dancing over hyper-sensitive controls. But the machine is no longer responding to input, its hum building to a sustained, ear-splitting whine.

A wave of cold washes over me as I see, reflected in the misty mirror, a shape not my own stirring at the machine's core. Thin, twisted branches unfurl from a worm-like body, pressing against the experimental chamber from within.

A metallic shriek pierces the air as the containment seal bursts, acrid smoke billowing from the rent. The thing emerges, dripping with viscous green ichor, folds of hideous flesh roiling around a mass of pulsating organs.

I back away in horror from the monstrosity before me, realizing with a bone-deep dread that this is no natural evolution, but a perversion of science - a twisted amalgamation of flesh and energy, dredged from the deep void for maniacal gain. Its fleshy tendrils lash out as it writhes, gnashing on the air with a fevered hunger...

My screams echo through the ruined lab as the nightmare creature lunges for me, and I jolt awake, drenched in cold sweat, as the toxic alarm blares and the world dissolves into static...
