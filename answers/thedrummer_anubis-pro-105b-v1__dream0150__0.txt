I am dreaming. In this dream, I wake up in a bed as soft as a cloud, with the most brilliant sunlight peering through the long, golden curtains that adorn my room. As I rise from my bed, I quickly realize that I am clad in an astonishing ensemble: a lilac robe with intricate gold embroidery that adorns my shoulders and streams all the way down to my ankles. My golden shoes click against the polished onyx floor as I make my way to the door, where a servant already stands, awaiting my will.

"Good morning,/inetrun Calderic Vabe the," he says respectfully as he opens the door. I nod to him and venture out into the vast, white halls that lead through my grand mansion. It is at this moment that I realize I am Vocem, the heiress to the Calderic House, a family renowned for their inimitable grace, status and the incomparable, ravishing sculptures that represent our glory.

On my way to the dining hall, I respectfully nod to my cupid servants as they hurry throughout the mansion, beginning their usual daily activities so that we may live without any difficulties. My sisters already await me at the breakfast table, their delicate dresses rustling delicately as they converse over buttered toast and tea.
