I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the static buzz of a thousand ticking clocks, each one embedded in the walls, ceilings, and floors of an endless, shifting office. Desks float like icebergs in a sea of fluorescent light, their surfaces cluttered with papers that writhe and multiply, birthing new spreadsheets and memos that flutter like panicked moths. You’re at the center of it all, your hands smeared with ink that glows faintly blue, as though your blood has been replaced by liquid deadlines.  

Your boss—no, something *more* than your boss—hovers above you, a towering figure with a face made of rotating calendar pages. Their voice is a tectonic rumble: *“This is urgent. This is critical. This cannot wait.”* They toss folders at you that explode into flocks of starlings midair, each bird clutching a USB drive in its talons. You try to catch them, but your arms stretch like taffy, elongating into corridors that spiral into black holes.  

The deadlines are alive now. They coil around your ankles like serpents made of spreadsheet cells, their scales clicking as they hiss, *“Overdue. Overdue.”* You sprint across a floor that melts into quicksand with every step, sinking into a swamp of sticky Post-it notes and shattered laptop screens. Behind you, the ceiling collapses into a storm of unpaid invoices and performance reviews, each sheet sharp as a shard of glass.  

You reach for your coffee mug, but it’s a bottomless pit, swirling with dark matter that slurps down your reflection. Your keyboard types itself, keys hammering like a ghostly stenographer transcribing your panic: *“Not enough time. Not enough hands. Not enough oxygen.”* The walls pulse like lungs, in and out, in and out, until they constrict into a narrow chute, forcing you to crawl through a tunnel of teeth-like staples and paperclips gnashing above your head.  

Then, a shift.  

You’re suddenly weightless, floating in a void where time has no meaning. Constellations bloom across your skin—each star a task you’ve ever completed, each supernova a priority that consumed you. The calendar-faced boss looms again, but now they’re made of smoke, their voice echoing from a great distance: *“Adapt. Accelerate. Assimilate.”* You open your mouth to scream, but out pours a river of ink, pooling into a new world below—a world where the ground is made of canceled meetings and the trees grow Wi-Fi signals as fruit.  

You land softly, sinking into a couch that’s actually a stack of unread emails. A clockwork owl perches on your shoulder, whispering, *“You are infinite. You are insufficient. You are both.”* Above, the sky fractures into a mosaic of progress bars, each one inching forward at a different pace. One turns red. Then green. Then explodes into confetti that tastes like burnt toast.  

You wake up—or do you?—in your bed, but your hands are still stained with blue ink, and the alarm clock reads **“PRIORITY: BREATHING.”**
