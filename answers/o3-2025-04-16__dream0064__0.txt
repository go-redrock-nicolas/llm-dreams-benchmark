I am dreaming. …step into an auditorium that could never exist in waking life. It appears to be carved from a single piece of shimmering moonstone, yet inside it glows with an amber warmth like sunset caught in crystal. Rows of velvet cushions form a gentle spiral instead of straight lines, so that every seat faces the center of the room and every participant faces everyone else—no one is hidden in corners here.

As you find your place, the air hums with a quiet chorus of heartbeats, almost musical. Each person you pass seems to wear a small constellation above their head: faint pinpricks of starlight that flicker in rhythm with their emotions. Your own cluster of lights materializes as soon as you sit. Immediately you feel less alone; the room itself seems to breathe with collective understanding.

A bell made of rainbow glass rings without being touched. The facilitator rises—not a typical therapist, but a tall figure draped in garments that appear woven from sunrise and snowfall. Their face shifts gently, reflecting every expression in the room, as though mirroring your feelings to prove they’re seen. They greet the group with a voice that sounds like turning pages, inviting everyone to “unburden their stories, aloud or in silence.”

One by one, participants share. A woman whose constellation glows sea-green speaks of storms of overthinking; as she describes them, miniature thunderclouds drift from her palms, raining silver droplets that evaporate before they land. A young man made entirely of translucent parchment confides in crackling whispers that he fears being torn; faint script appears on his skin with every word, paragraphs of unspoken worries. Then an elderly figure—half tree, half human—rustles like autumn leaves while explaining how deeply rooted grief can be.

When your turn arrives, your throat tightens, but the entire spiral leans forward in a gesture of collective listening. Words come out as ribbons of mist, forming the shape of the burden you’ve carried: a heavy stone etched with looping doubts. Soon twenty pairs of hands—human, branch-shaped, parchment-thin—reach in, not to take the stone but to touch it, acknowledging its weight. In their touch it shrinks slowly, becoming a river-pebble, then a grain of sand, then a single mote of dust that floats upward and disappears into the skylight, where a real sky now glimmers through a previously hidden aperture.

The facilitator nods, and suddenly the spiral seating unfurls like a nautilus shell. The group walks together into a corridor of softly pulsing light, walls lined with mirrors that do not show reflections but possibilities: futures where your challenges exist yet no longer define you. You glimpse yourself laughing beneath enormous willow trees, or teaching others to release their own stones, or simply breathing freely on a quiet morning.

Before anyone can linger, the hallway dissolves into a meadow of tall, luminescent grasses that tickle your ankles. Fireflies the size of teardrops hover, each containing an image of a moment you once believed was lost—childhood wonder, an unspoken dream, the warmth of friendship you feared you’d never feel again. You cup your hands and a firefly settles there, its glow sinking into your skin. From somewhere far away, you hear the facilitator’s page-turning voice: “Take this light back with you. Even when you wake, it will find a way to shine.”

A drowsy wind sweeps the meadow, and the world folds like origami in reverse—closing, compressing, until you are back at the center of the moonstone auditorium. The bell rings once more, sounding this time like a single heartbeat. Every constellation brightens, then threads of starlight rise and entwine, weaving a tapestry above the group—proof that each individual orbit now belongs to something vaster.

Your eyelids flutter. The room recedes. Yet as you hover on the edge of waking, you still feel the faint pulse of starlight at your temples, the lingering warmth of all those hands on the stone, and the memory of the facilitator’s parting words: “We will meet again whenever hope calls itself a dream.”
