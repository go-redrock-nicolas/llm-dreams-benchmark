I am dreaming. You've endured a series of consecutive hardships that would break most people's spirit. Finding yourself at yet another crossroads of adversity, you feel the weight of it all pressing down upon your shoulders. The sky above is a tumultuous sea of indigo and slate, clouds churning like thoughts in a troubled mind.

As you stand on this unfamiliar road, you notice the ground beneath your feet isn't asphalt or dirt, but thousands of tiny silver keys, all glinting with peculiar light despite the darkness overhead. They shift and tinkle musically with each step, responding to the rhythm of your breathing.

Ahead, the path splits into three directions. The first is overgrown with luminescent flowers that pulse with gentle blue light, their petals unfurling and reaching toward you as if beckoning. The second path descends sharply, lined with mirrors that don't reflect your image but instead show strangers' faces, all wearing expressions of profound understanding. The third winds upward around a spiral staircase made of what appears to be flowing water, somehow solid enough to climb.

From somewhere distant comes the sound of a melancholy cello, playing a melody that feels eerily familiar, as though it's been haunting you all your life without your awareness. The music seems to whisper your name in between notes.

You feel a curious lightness spreading through your limbs, and looking down, you realize your skin is becoming translucent, veins glowing with a soft amber light that pulses with your heartbeat. Despite everything you've been through, this transformation doesn't frighten youâ€”instead, it feels like remembering something essential you'd forgotten long ago.

Which path will you choose? What will you become? The dream waits, breathing with infinite patience, as the keys beneath your feet begin to rise and orbit around you like metallic fireflies, each one promising to unlock a different future.
