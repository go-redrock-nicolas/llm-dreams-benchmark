I am dreaming. I'm floating above a lush, vibrant forest, the trees swaying gently in the breeze like ballerinas on stage. The air is alive with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers and the soft chirping of birds. As I descend, the forest floor comes into focus, and I see my dear friend, Lena, walking along a winding path. Her long, curly hair cascades down her back like a rich, chestnut waterfall.

Lena's eyes are fixed on some unknown point ahead, her expression resolute, yet troubled. I'm drawn to her, my concern growing with each step she takes. She's heading towards a dark, foreboding cave, its entrance shrouded in a mist that seems to be pulsing with an otherworldly energy. I try to call out to her, to warn her away from the cave's mysterious allure, but my voice is muffled, as if I'm speaking through a veil of silk.

As Lena approaches the cave, a figure emerges from the shadows. It's a tall, enigmatic woman with skin as white as alabaster and hair as black as the night sky. She's dressed in a flowing gown that seems to be woven from the very fabric of the mist, and her eyes gleam with an unsettling intensity. Lena is entranced, her gaze locked onto the woman's, and I can sense a strange, hypnotic connection forming between them.

The woman begins to whisper in Lena's ear, her words indistinguishable, but the tone is unmistakable â€“ a seductive, honeyed whisper that seems to be weaving a spell around my friend. Lena's eyes glaze over, and she nods, as if she's being drawn into a world that I can't see. I'm desperate to intervene, to shake her out of this trance-like state, but my feet feel rooted to the spot.

As I watch, helpless and anxious, Lena follows the mysterious woman into the cave. The entrance swallows them whole, and I'm left standing alone, the forest growing darker and more menacing by the second. The trees seem to be closing in around me, their branches tangling together like skeletal fingers. I'm consumed by a sense of foreboding, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios.

Suddenly, I'm inside the cave, standing beside Lena. The air is thick with an eerie, pulsating energy, and I can feel the weight of the woman's gaze upon me. Lena turns to me, her eyes still glazed, and I see a flicker of recognition, a glimmer of the friend I once knew. But it's too late; she's already made her choice, and I'm left to wonder if I'll ever be able to reach her again.

The dream begins to distort, the images warping and twisting like a reflection in rippling water. I'm left with a sense of disorientation, my concern for Lena still simmering, a burning coal that refuses to be extinguished. As the dream fades, I'm left with the haunting feeling that I've lost my friend to a world beyond my own, and that I'll have to find a way to navigate the darkness to reach her again.
