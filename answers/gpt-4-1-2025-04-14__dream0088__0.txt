I am dreaming. …I find myself standing in a vast, labyrinthine office—walls shifting like tides with each new assignment. Papers flutter overhead like migratory birds, thick clusters of deadlines stamped in red diving toward my outstretched hands. My desk stretches for miles, swelling with teetering stacks of folders and laptops glowing with urgent notifications. For every task I complete, two more bloom hydra-like in its place, their subject lines writhing with exclamation marks.

In the distance, the outlines of leadership figures morph and blur: they stand tall on pedestals made of schedules and memos, their voices echoing through the halls in overlapping waves—"Critical! Top priority! Needs attention yesterday!" Their faces flicker between familiar and faceless, eyes always fixed on me.

My heartbeat syncs with the relentless pinging of new deadlines. Breath short, I try to sprint down the hall, but my feet become entangled in charging cables and calendar pages, sticky with neon post-it notes that whisper, “Not enough, not enough…”

Suddenly, the ceiling above splinters open, and a cascade of golden light pours down. I look up—time itself has fractured, hours and minutes tumbling in slow motion like snowflakes. I reach out, gathering minutes in my palms, desperate to patch together a solution. But the minutes dissolve into sand, slipping between my fingers.

As the sand piles at my feet, the office walls dissolve, and I’m swept upward on a tidal wave of swirling deadlines—weightless, dizzy, both liberated and out of control. Floating above the chaos, I glimpse the face of the clock in the sky, its hands spinning backward and forward in a dizzying cycle. I realize: there is no finish line, only the surreal dance of demands, the intoxicating pressure to do what cannot be done.

And as I spin farther up, a strange calm settles over me—the realization that in this dream-world of impossible expectations, perhaps I can bend the rules of time, slide unseen between the seconds, and breathe deep the sweet air of the impossible becoming strangely, dreamily possible.
