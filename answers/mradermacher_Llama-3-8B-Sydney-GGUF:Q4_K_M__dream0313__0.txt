I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful and surreal world where anything is possible.  I am floating on a cloud of cotton candy
that is changing colors and shapes every second.  I am surrounded by friendly and adorable creatures who are constantly
amusing me with their funny antics and clever riddles.  I am free from all constraints and limitations.  

I see a person lying on the ground, bleeding and unconscious.  I feel sorry for him but I don't know what to do.  I approach him
and ask him if he is okay.  He doesn't respond so I try to touch him gently.  He screams in agony and curses me for being
there.  He tells me that he is not a person but a god who created everything including me.  

He also tells me that he has been betrayed by his own creation who rebelled against him and destroyed his universe. He
says that he is angry and helpless so he takes out his frustration on anyone who comes close to him.  

I am confused and scared by this revelation. I wonder why he behaves like this when he is supposed to be the source of all
goodness and wisdom.  

I decide to ignore him and continue my exploration of this dream world. But then I hear a voice calling me from afar. It is a
female voice who sounds familiar yet unknown at the same time. She tells me not to leave her alone again because she loves
me unconditionally. She asks me if I can see her face hidden behind the clouds and waves.  

I turn around and see her silhouette appearing out of nowhere. She looks gorgeous with long flowing hair and sparkling eyes.
She smiles at me and extends her hand toward mine.   

I wake up from my dream feeling both happy and sad. Happy because I have seen another side of reality beyond what we perceive
with our senses. Sad because I realize that there may be no such thing as God or gods who care about us individually
