I am dreaming. You find yourself drifting through a grand, shimmering atrium—a place that seems both familiar and impossible at once. The walls are carved from luminescent crystal, each facet reflecting the golden candlelight dancing in the corners. Pendulous vines of ivy wind down from overhead, and creeping among them are ghostly flameflies that spark and curl like living embers. Even the air tastes of something mythical—like orange blossoms in an ancient library.

At first, you’re calmed by this dreamy stage: the hush of your footsteps on the marble floor, the echo of your own breathing. Yet, woven into this serenity is a secret you have just uncovered—an agonizing truth about someone you love. The moment you learned it remains crystal-clear in your mind, and though your surroundings shift and twist dreamily, that memory stays fixed like an iron brand. It’s knowledge so heavy, you can almost feel it physically weighing down your heart.

Up ahead, you glimpse this cherished person—smiling, spinning in wonder at the extravagant pillars of light. They have no idea what you’ve discovered. Each time they glance over at you, their eyes glitter with hope and delight, but you can hardly meet their gaze. You know that if you were to speak the words lodged in your throat, you would unravel their happiness forever. 

The atrium stretches onward until it transitions into a corridor that narrows into the shape of a keyhole—tall, elliptical, and carved with swirling runes that glow in familiar patterns. You sense that passing through will reveal something more—some hidden chamber of understanding. Yet your footsteps slow. This fresh secret weighs on you, begs for release, though you cannot bear to break your friend’s spirit. 

You watch as they move ahead, calling your name softly, their voice echoing through the corridor’s winding expanse. Shadows pool at your feet, slithering up the walls as if to devour the golden light. They cast ghostly silhouettes of your internal dread, elongated, trembling, dancing across the glimmering crystal. You take one wavering step, then another, feeling the sting of tears behind your eyes—even in this dream, your sorrow is keen and potent.

As the corridor opens into a grand library—shelves spiraling into impossible heights, stuffed with scrolls and thick tomes—you realize that each volume holds lives, secrets, hopes, and catastrophes. In the center of the marble floor gleams an ornate mosaic of a monstrous serpent devouring its tail, a symbol of eternal cycles. You are pulled toward a single volume lying open on a pedestal, as if awaiting your inspection. There, you see vivid, moving illustrations of your friend’s life. Their joys, their triumphs, and then the unknown tragedy that now resides in your mind’s safe but torturous keeping.

Your friend steps nearer, drawn by the silent invitation of the pulsing runes on the pedestal. They raise an eyebrow, quietly urging you to share what you see. Your heart thuds against your chest like a warning drum. You imagine the heartbreak that would spread across their expression if they learned of this secret, how the radiant light in their eyes would flicker and die in an instant. The partial relief of unburdening yourself tangles with a fierce compassion that wants to protect them from this knowledge.

Then a hush falls over the library, and all the flameflies flutter to a standstill, their once-coruscating sparks frozen in midair. Captured in that silence, it’s as though time itself has paused, holding its breath for your decision. You catch a glimpse of your own reflection in the polished floor: features twisted in conflict, tears rolling silently, a silent entreaty for guidance you’re not sure how to heed. 

Yet your friend is still there, content, curious, and unaware. You realize you must walk this delicate line, concealing the secret for now. Quietly, you close the book, pressing the cover shut with trembling hands. Its spine glistens like a harsh truth sealed away. In your mind, you beg forgiveness for what you’ve withheld, for this burden you must shoulder, at least for a while.

In the dream’s final hush, the friend gently places a hand on your arm, offering comfort while oblivious to the turmoil swirling beneath your outward composure. The library fades, the serpent mosaic dissolves into ripples of golden light, and the entire dream cracks like the shell of an egg. Sunlight bursts through, washing everything in warmth. You stir in your bed, heart heavy—a faint memory of something precious and painful clutched in your chest. For a moment, you wonder if it was truly a dream at all… or if you must carry that hidden truth into waking life.
