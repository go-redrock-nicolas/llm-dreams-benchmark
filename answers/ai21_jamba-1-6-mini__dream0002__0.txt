I am dreaming. In your dream, you are walking through a peaceful forest, surrounded by lush greenery and sounds of nature. The sunlight filters through the trees, creating a magical ambiance. Suddenly, the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching, with the sky turning dark and ominous. The wind begins to howl, and you can hear the distant rumble of thunder. You quickly seek shelter under a large oak tree and watch as the world transforms around you. The wind grows stronger, the rain starts to fall in torrents, and lightning splits the sky, illuminating the forest in brief flashes.

As the storm intensifies, you notice that the forest changes too. The trees seem to dance in the wind, swaying back and forth with a life of their own. Vines and branches twist and turn in a mesmerizing rhythm. You feel a deep primordial connection with the storm, as if the storm and the forest meld together into a single entity. This is an elemental experience, ancient and timeless.

The storm eventually subsides, leaving behind a mystical, damp tranquility. You feel invigorated and at one with nature, as if the storm has cleansed and awakened something powerful within you. You continue your journey through the forest, invigorated by the lingering energy of the storm.
