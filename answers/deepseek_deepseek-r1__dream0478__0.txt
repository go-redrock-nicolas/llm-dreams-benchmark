I am dreaming. I must anchor myself. Phenomenological sensations, how things feel. Smells, tastes, textures bring me into the moment. But everything morphs. My memories reanimate suddenly, sliding into place with new context.  

Ten years ago, lingering grief over a faded friendship. That torment of clouded interactions, unresolved words—now replaced with clarity. Beneath my feet, cobblestones shift to the wooden floorboards of an attic I never had. Light flickers through a prismatic window I never saw, casting colors that pierce my guilt. A scent—burnt sugar and pine—carries voices. Her voice: “I was always afraid for you.” Half-remembered arguments bleed into confessions. A locket in my palm, warm, inscribed with “Forgive the silence.” When did she leave this? Time splinters. The walls whisper in her cadence. I grasp at the threads before waking—wind rushing through an impossible orchard outside the window, petals swirling into words I still can’t read.
I am floating in the hazy liminal space between sleep and wakefulness, the air thick with the scent of my childhood—damp library books and the tang of rusted swingset chains. But then the world tilts, gravity pooling like liquid mercury in my palms. The floor dissolves, and I’m standing in a corridor lined with doors. Each one pulses faintly, throbbing like veins. My hands brush a knob carved from obsidian, cold as betrayal, and it opens into a room I don’t recognize, yet know intimately.  

There she is: the friend whose absence once carved caverns in my chest. But here, she’s not the blurred photograph I’ve clung to. Her hair is strands of molten gold catching sunlight that shouldn’t exist—this room has no windows. She’s sewing constellations into a tapestry, thread shimmering like trapped comets. “You thought I left,” she says without looking up, her voice the hum of a cello string. “But I’ve been stitching this for you. Look closer.”  

I lean in. The tapestry isn’t fabric but layers of translucent skin, etched with phosphorescent veins. Each stitch pricks a memory: her handing me a jar of fireflies the summer we turned thirteen, my laughter syrupy and bright; her face crumpling when I mocked her nervous habit of tracing doorframes. The scenes shift—now I see her weeks after our rift, kneeling in a storm to bury a letter under our old oak, rain blurring the ink into oblivion. I never knew.  

The floor beneath me becomes a bog of wet petals, each one a shredded page from our unfinished letters. Cedar smoke curls around my ankles, coaxing out a truth I’d armored over: *I was cruel because I envied your light.* The walls hum in agreement, peeling back to reveal a garden where every rose is a clock, petals peeling away to chime the hours we lost. She places the locket in my hand—it’s alive, a tiny heart beating against my thumb. “Read it now,” she urges. The inscription bleeds, rearranging into a language of flickering firefly signals: *You were never unloveable. I just forgot how to speak.*  

When I wake, the taste of burnt sugar lingers, and my pillowcase is strewn with oak leaves, brittle and fragrant. They crumble to dust before I can grasp them.
