I am dreaming. I find myself descending into the labyrinthine depths of ancient catacombs, a sprawling subterranean necropolis carved from the bones of the earth itself. The air is thick with the scent of damp stone and the faint, musty whisper of decay, a reminder of the countless souls who rest here in eternal silence. My only companion is a single torch, its flame a fragile beacon against the oppressive gloom, casting long, wavering shadows that dance like specters along the jagged walls. The flickering light reveals fleeting glimpses of intricate carvings—forgotten runes and grotesque visages of gods or demons, their hollow eyes seeming to follow my every step.

The narrow passage twists and turns, each step echoing with a hollow resonance that seems to awaken the very stone around me. My heart thuds in my chest, a drumming counterpoint to the eerie stillness, as I grip the torch tighter, its wooden shaft rough against my palm. Suddenly, without warning, the flame begins to sputter, a sickly stutter of light that threatens to abandon me to the void. Each flicker is a betrayal, the amber glow shrinking into a frail pinpoint before flaring weakly once more. The darkness grows bolder with every failure, creeping closer, a living entity that hungers to swallow me whole. It seeps into the edges of my vision, a suffocating shroud that distorts the world into an disorienting maze of half-seen shapes and imagined whispers.

My breath catches as the torch dims yet again, and for a heartbeat, I am plunged into absolute blackness. It’s a darkness so complete it feels like a weight, pressing against my skin, filling my lungs with its inky presence. Panic claws at my mind, a primal fear of being lost forever in this underworld tomb. I fumble blindly, my free hand scraping against the rough stone walls, searching for some anchor, some sign of direction. The cold, unyielding rock offers no comfort, but as my fingers trace the grooves of an ancient carving, a low hum seems to vibrate through the stone—a sound or a sensation, I cannot tell—pulsing like the heartbeat of the catacombs themselves.

The torch flares briefly, a desperate gasp of light, illuminating a fork in the passage ahead. To the left, the air seems heavier, laced with a metallic tang, and I swear I see a faint shimmer, like the glint of something watching from the shadows. To the right, the path descends steeper, the walls glistening with moisture, and a distant, rhythmic drip echoes like the ticking of a forgotten clock. My torch sputters once more, the flame now a mere ember, and I know I have mere moments before the darkness claims me entirely. My chest tightens, indecision warring with dread, as I strain to listen for any sound—a whisper, a warning, a guide. But there is only the oppressive silence, broken by the erratic crackle of my dying light.

Then, from the depths of the left passage, a sound emerges—a soft, melodic hum, almost human, weaving through the air like a siren’s call. It’s beautiful, haunting, and utterly wrong in this place of death. My skin prickles with unease, yet something in the melody tugs at my soul, urging me forward. The torch gives one final, pitiful flicker, and as the darkness surges to envelop me, I make my choice, stepping into the left passage with the haunting song as my only guide. The blackness crashes over me like a wave, and yet, that melody lingers, a thread of sound in the void, pulling me deeper into the unknown heart of the catacombs. My footsteps echo, uncertain and trembling, as I surrender to the mystery of what awaits—be it salvation or doom.
