I am dreaming. I must explore these ancient catacombs. My lantern's flame is like a wobbling tongue of light, and its flickers distort the walls, each dimming creates an illusion of falling or rising wherever the shadows hunger. I can hear my breathing and the sound of my footsteps on the damp stone echoes too precisely, as if the space contracts around me to amplify them. Then, the light dies completely. The caverns swallow all traces of the light like ink spilling over a candle. Hands raised in front of me, I can't see them. Not even the faintest suggestion of outline. kì? A voice murmurs. The word isn’t fully formed but resonates with the dampness around. It's not English, isn't any language I know. A cold presence near my left shoulder, and when I spin instinctively, my fingers brush something tactile yet veil-like, though no temperature, texture, or form can be grasped. I'm motionless for a moment. My pulse thrums in my ears, and a sensation of being watched by many without eyes. Then, heat where there was cold. A corresponding whisper in the same unfamiliar tongue—kì? again but more questioning now. Panic starts to rise. The darkness feels like it has a ravenous hunger, pressing in to fill every hollow of my being. Suddenly, the air is colder, much colder, and I feel a hard clink against my boot. I crouch, touching the object. Metal, rusted yet shaped so elegantly—it's a lockpick, its surface generating a faint metallic glow that slowly expands, painting the tunnel walls with a sickly blue pallor. I grip it tighter, and the radiance flares, illuminating carvings along the path. The symbols pulse in response to my heartbeat. They are runes—old, layered over with newer glyphs. Between the cracks of the runes, I see reflections of myself as a small child, then as an old man. This is the Labyrinth of the Forgotten Self*\].\** …The walls shift. The corruption of the outer rings has corrupted the center. Only through shedding the outer husk can you reach the remains of...* the voice fades, the sentence incomplete. The air is dense with something like static, and my heartbeat syncs with a throbbing in the earth beneath my feet. I move toward the carvings, the light from the lockpick now leading the way, but the path splits into three chambers. Each entrance is a mirror, reflecting not my body but different emotional states—despair, tranquility, rage—and with each glance, I feel their pull. I must choose. What is reflected in each chamber, and how do I escape?
