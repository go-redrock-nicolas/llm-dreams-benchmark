I am dreaming. …gasp for breath, feeling the heat wrap around you like an iron-hot cloak. The horizon blurs into a wall of orange and violent crimson, licking the sky with forked tongues. Sparks drift past like incandescent fireflies, settling on pine needles that burst into sudden, furious light. The air tastes of scorched resin and copper, and every inhale scratches your lungs as if you’ve swallowed a handful of sand.

Yet in this dreamworld, panic carries a strange, slow-motion clarity. You notice impossible details: the way each ember pirouettes in its short life; the delicate cracking of branches echoing like violin strings warped by fever. Your mind drifts outward, searching for escape but finding only surreal shifts.

A boulder nearby ripples—stone becoming liquid glass—revealing a labyrinth of mirrors beneath its surface. Instinct tells you to dive in, but when you step forward, the mirrors tilt, casting back thousands of reflections: all of you, all suffocating, all ablaze. You recoil, heartbeat pounding, as the boulder solidifies again with a shattering chime.

Smoke thickens, folding around you like a gray cocoon. Through the haze you spy a majestic stag, charcoal black, antlers aflame yet unconsumed. Its eyes hold the cool tranquility of moonlight on winter ice. It bows, as if inviting you onto its back. Desperation overrules disbelief. You climb, and the stag surges forward, hooves striking sparks that crackle into tiny constellations on the forest floor.

Wind tears at your face as the stag leaps—and suddenly ground drops away. You soar above a patchwork of burning treetops that resemble molten rivers twisting through the night. Lightning cracks open the heavy smoke ceiling, spilling violet light; thunder follows like distant drums. For a heartbeat the world suspends itself—silent, glowing, apocalyptic, beautiful.

Then the dream pivots again. Flames below shift into waves of poppies, scarlet petals undulating like an ocean in bloom. The stag lands upon their surface with featherlight grace. A hush blankets the scene. The heat is gone; the air, sweet with florid perfume. You feel a weight lift from your chest, as though the wildfire had been the fevered part of a story’s first act and this—this endless field—is the epilogue.

The stag kneels. You dismount and sink knee-deep in blossoms. Far away a silver river curves under a crescent moon, and fireflies (real ones this time) pulse in quiet choreography. A single ember drifts down, but instead of burning, it cools into a tear-shaped opal that lands in your palm, humming softly, like a living heartbeat.

A whisper—your own voice, impossibly distant—echoes from the night: “You are the spark and the rain, the fear and the calm.” You press the opal to your chest and feel warmth spread, not scorching but soothing, as if every anxious breath had been transmuted into the glow of a silent sunrise.

The dream softens along its edges. The poppy field fades into soft watercolor. The stag becomes a silhouette of pale smoke, then dissolves entirely, leaving behind the distant hush of crickets. You blink, and the world goes weightless, drifting into a final hush.

When your eyes open at last, you’re back in the quiet familiarity of your room, heartbeat steady, lungs full of cool dawn air—yet you swear you can still smell a faint, sweet hint of smoke and poppies, lingering like an echo of someplace almost real.
