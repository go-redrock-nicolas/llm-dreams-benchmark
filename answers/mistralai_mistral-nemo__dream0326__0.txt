I am dreaming. I am standing in a vast, otherworldly library, the air thick with the scent of ancient parchment and beeswax candles. The walls stretch high above, lined with books that seem to go on forever, their spines glowing with an ethereal tremor, like a thousand auroras trapped under glass. The silence is profound, yet alive, humming with whispered secrets from lifetimes past.

I am standing at the center of this silent, luminous expanse, clutching a scroll in my hands. It's a delicate thing, its surface as silken as a moonlit night, the ink shimmering like stardust. This scroll contains worlds, entire galaxies of thoughts and emotions that I desperately need to share. It's the most important thing I've ever held, more precious than any treasure, more sacred than any creed.

I begin to unravel it, the parchment unwinding from my fingers like a ribbon of time. The words dances before me, written in a language that isn't quite visible, yet I understand it instinctively. Each sentence is a constellation of meaning, each phrase a symphony of sentiment. I can feel the power of this scroll coursing through me, its importance reverberating in my very soul.

I turn to share this revelation with those around me. But they're not there. At least, not as I expect them to be. They're floating, like invested; space-walkers in an infinite void. Their eyes are closed, their hearts seemingly plugged with wax. They can't see the scroll, don't understand its language. They're deaf to its whispers, blind to its radiance.

I try to shout, to call out, but my voice is lost in the endless vaccuum. I wave the scroll, its light playing on their closed faces, hoping to wake them, to show them. But they remain unmoved, untouched, unseeing. Panic rises in me, clenching my heart like a cold fist. I'm desperate, pawing at their closed eyes, my own tears falling like rain on their silent faces. But they're impossible to reach, impossible to understand.

I fall to my knees, the library around me fading, its light dimming. I'm alone, my scroll unfurled, its words faded, their meaning lost. Frustration, despair, loneliness - they crash over me like a tidal wave. I'm drowning in the deepest ocean of despair, lost amidst the unreachable stars of comprehension. Yet, amidst this storm of emotion, a tiny glimmer remains - the unrelenting belief that this scroll, this message, this dream, must one day be understood.
