I am dreaming.

The metallic screeching of steel grinding to a halt fills my bones, followed by a slap of velvet-black darkness. A hush falls over the subway car, the pulse of fluorescents dying mid-flicker, leaving us bathed only in the vague blue glow of emergency lights. All around me, strangers' voices rise in hushed clusters—anxious mothers whispering to frightened children, a teenager's nervous laughter, the panicked shuffling of feet.

As fear begins to simmer, my senses sharpen. I press my palm to the cold, ribbed plastic of my seat, steadying myself. The air thickens with the scent of metal and uneasy sweat. My own breathing echoes unnaturally loud in my ears.

Suddenly—a faint, far-off music curls through the tunnel, impossibly out of place. It’s the tinkling lilac notes of a music box, delicate and hypnotic. The melody draws me, and I stand. As if compelled, I follow the sound, weaving between clusters of bewildered passengers. Their faces are etched in the dim light like characters from half-remembered stories. None seem to notice I’m slipping past, as if we’re separated by sheets of dream-glass.

I reach the door between train cars. It pulses—softly, like the beat of a living heart. Without thinking, I press my hand against it. The door slides open effortlessly, and I’m greeted by a sudden rush of glowing fireflies pouring from the seams, casting strange constellations in the dark.

I step out, not into the next car, but into a forest dappled with moonlight. The train has melted away, leaving only mossy ground beneath my feet and trees whispering overhead. The music is louder here, and in the distance I see a crescent-shaped clearing encircled by branches. In the center, a grand piano sits atop a patch of wildflowers, each bloom glimmering silver in the night.

I walk towards it, leaves crunching underfoot, as the dream reshapes itself in dazzling detail. When I reach the piano, the lid lifts itself, and glittering birds emerge, launching into the sky where the ceiling should have been, carrying threads of silk behind them that weave new stars into existence.

Suddenly, I realize all the passengers are here too—no longer afraid, but radiant and curious, their eyes wide in the reflected starlight. They are listening to the music, listening for the next note, and I sense that whatever happens next is waiting for me to play. The keys of the piano wait, cool and smooth beneath my trembling fingertips. The dream holds its breath, shimmering at the edge of a new beginning.
