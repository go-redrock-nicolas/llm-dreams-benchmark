I am dreaming.

The sky above me is not sky at all, but a vast, breathing tapestry of translucent jellyfish woven together in a slow, celestial dance. Their bodies pulse with soft light, casting shifting hues over a world that does not feel of this Earth. Underfoot, glassy stones hum when I step on them, resonating in tones that echo not through the air, but directly inside my mind. It’s as if each stone carries a memory—flickers of forgotten moments, long-dismissed glances, the way sunlight struck my grandmother's silver hair when she picked me up from school in that faded blue sedan.

I walk barefoot through a forest of thoughts. Not trees—no leaves, no bark—but immense stalks of luminous leaves that unfurl or curl closed depending on the emotion passing through my heart. When I feel sorrow, they shrink inward, trembling like startled ferns. When I feel wonder, they open wide, blossoming into spires of color that perfume the air with warmth and a kind of inexplicable calm.

And I am full. Full of life. Of emotion. Of vivid, vibrant, bubbling gratitude, like long-dormant rivers in me have begun to run again.

The wind carries voices—not commands or words, but the subtle whispers of my every relationship, experience, and moment that I had previously ignored or taken for granted. The cracked sidewalk outside my childhood home, where I first learned to ride a bike—the bruises, the scraped knees, the belief in me from someone who held me when I cried.

A woman sits on a bench made of clouds, her face half-lit by the rhythm of the floating stars above. She looks familiar but undefined, as if born of every kind heart that ever comforted mine. She offers a cup made of light. When I drink, warmth blooms in my chest—not sweet, not bitter, but a perfect harmony of every taste I've ever loved. Suddenly I remember my favorite rainstorm at age seven, the sound of thunder that scared me, and then the laughter of my sibling chasing me through the puddles with nothing but joy as our shoes squelched.

This is why I weep in the dream.

Not because I feel loss, but because I remember how much I have been held, even when I didn't know it.

In the distance, a river of liquid gratitude runs through a canyon. Its current sings in soft choirs—a hundred harmonies blending the names of things I used to ignore: morning alarm clocks, the act of breathing, the sound of wind chimes someone hung long ago on a porch no one visits anymore.

There, beside me now, something like a stag emerges, but it's not flesh and bone. It’s light and shadow dancing together in seamless rhythm, antlers made from every kindness I ever received, every act that made me feel safe, seen, and loved—some given freely, some unnoticed at the time.

The stag bows, and in this simple gesture, I understand—an offering. The dream is not trying to please me. It is showing me the undercurrent of my life, the unseen miracles, the quiet inheritances of grace that I’ve tended to miss in the noise of my daily to-do’s and rush towards tomorrow.

I feel deep peace.

I don't want to leave, but the dream begins to soften. Colors bleed softly inward like watercolor petals collapsing into the paintbrush well. The star-voiced wind whispers, “Carry this back. Let your life be your altar. Every breath a prayer. When you wake, remember. Really remember.”

And as I rise slowly from sleep, the dream still hovering like the last tones of sacred music inside of me, I find my eyes wide with warmth, with unexpected thankfulness for the miracle of being here, now.

Alive. Aware. And open.
