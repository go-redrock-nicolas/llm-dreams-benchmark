I am dreaming. I'm in a dark room with a green screen in front of me.  The instructions appear on the screen:
"Create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of your imagination."
I feel nervous and excited at the same time.  Why do they want me to create a dream?  Don't they have any dreamers who can do this?
I start thinking about what I can do.  I've never created a dream before.  I don't know if I can do it.  But I want to try.
I remember reading about some of the amazing things that people can do with their imaginations.  People who can paint masterpieces without ever seeing them.  People who can write epic novels without ever researching them.  People who can compose beautiful music without ever hearing it.
Can I be like them?  Can I create something that's never existed before?
I think about the audience waiting for me.  I wonder who they are.  Why do they care so much about my performance?  What will they think of me if I fail?
I decide to ignore all these questions and worries.  I just want to dream.
So I close my eyes and imagine a world where anything is possible.
I see a beautiful landscape filled with colorful flowers, gentle streams, and towering mountains.  I hear the sounds of birds singing, insects chirping, and wind blowing through the trees.  I smell the scents of fresh air, wild grasses, and exotic fruits.  I taste the flavors of sweet nectars, savory meats, and crunchy nuts.
I feel the textures of smooth skin, soft fur, and silky feathers.  I sense the presence of friendly creatures, curious spirits, and loving gods.
I start to wonder who I am in this world.  What kind of creature am I?  What powers do I have?
Then I remember that I don't need to know those things.  All I need to do is enjoy myself.
