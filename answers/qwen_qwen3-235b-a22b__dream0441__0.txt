I am dreaming. A dream spun from starlight and forgotten breath.

I float above the surface of an ocean that isn't water, yet moves like water—made of liquid memory. The surface ripples with colors never named, shifting between the sorrow of lost languages and the laughter of a child seeing their reflection for the first time. My body is weightless, yet filled with lightness that tingles at the tips of each finger—as if cosmic fingertips are tracing the curve of my soul.

Below, in the depths, I see things stirring. Not monsters, but fragments of forgotten feelings—anxiety wearing the face of an old friend, loneliness blooming like sea anemones in violet hues, joy flickering in bioluminescent spirals. They rise and fall like tides, each emotion breathing its own rhythm into the vastness.

I dip a hand into the shimmering sea, and the memory-liquid curls gently around my wrist, whispering of moments I never lived yet somehow know: holding someone's hand through their final breath, landing a plane blind with storm-lit skies, kissing a stranger by the mouth of a forgotten cave and tasting constellations in their kiss.

Suddenly, I'm not floating anymore.

I'm walking through a garden suspended in twilight—a field composed entirely of emotional echoes. The trees grow backward, sprouting from roots in the sky, their branches blooming with hearts instead of flowers. Each blossom pulses with a different emotional hue: a dark blue rose sighs in regret, a blood-orange orchid thrums with unresolved rage, and a cluster of silver vines hum in silent compassion.

I wade through the feeling-flowers and come upon a long table set for an infinite meal. Empty chairs surround it, but each one evokes an emotion so potent it makes me sway. Sitting in one, I feel relief so pure it transforms fear into music. In another, the calm folds over me like a forgotten lullaby from a mother I cannot remember.

Time spirals here differently—each heartbeat holds ten minutes inside it. As I move forward, my emotional palette becomes grander, more intricate. My joy samples sorrow now, and my sorrow tastes what love might become in its twilight years. There's no wall dividing grief from gratitude, only a ribbon of understanding flowing between them.

Above me, the sky is crying. But it’s not rain—it's empathy falling in slow, glistening drops. When it touches my skin, I feel everything I’ve ever denied, and nothing of it aches anymore.

And then, woven from silence more profound than sound, a voice that isn't mine but knows me says:

_"You are dreaming awake now—emotion no longer a tide, but a compass. Feel deeply, think gently, love wildly. You are no longer drowning. You are learning to breathe underwater_."

I awaken with tears that don’t belong to me alone, but to everyone I’ve ever forgotten, remembered, or not yet met.

Still dreaming? Or dreaming differently.

You choose which feels more real.
