I am dreaming. The dream is vivid, intense, and incredibly lifelike. A flurry of radiant colors dance around me as I walk through a bustling marketplace. Stalls line the cobblestone street, their canopies stretching like great wings above a vast array of goods. People from all walks of life bustle around, their voices forming a cacophonous symphony that fills the air with life. The smells are equally overwhelming: spices, fresh bread, and something sweet that I can’t quite place—all mingling together in an intoxicating blend. Despite the chaos, I feel a sense of calm, as if I’ve been here before, though I know I’ve never seen this place in my waking life.

As I walk, I notice a recurring figure dressed in deep greens and golds. He is tall with piercing amber eyes and a thick beard shot through with streaks of silver. His presence feels significant, though he says nothing as he moves through the crowd. Whenever I crane my neck to keep track of him, he is gone, lost in the sea of people. Yet, I feel drawn toward him, his movements forming a thread that pulls me deeper into the market.

I follow him instinctively, my footsteps quickening as I lose sight of him once more. I turn a corner, and I’m suddenly standing in a smaller, quieter street. The noise of the market fades, replaced by a rhythmic sound, like the pounding of a drum. The amber-eyed man stands at the end of the street, his back to me now. As I approach, his silhouette grows taller, his outline shifting, and the rhythmic pounding becomes louder. My heart races, matching the beats. 

I stop, unsure of whether to keep going. With every step, the pounding intensifies. The air grows warmer, the colors around us more vibrant yet somehow harsher. I want to turn back, yet I feel pulled forward, like there’s something I must understand in this place.

Suddenly, the man turns toward me. His face morphs, shifting into a reflection of myself—but older. He’s me, but with lines etched into his face, and his eyes hold a deep, knowing look. The drum pounds louder now, almost deafening. “Are you ready?” he asks, his voice like thunder. acheiving greatness

I open my mouth to respond, but as I do, the scene shifts again. 

I am now standing on the edge of a vast canyon. The sun sets in the distance, casting long shadows over the rocky terrain below. A cold wind howls through the canyon, carrying with it whispers that I can’t quite make out. I look down, realizing that I’m standing on a fragile wooden bridge that stretches across the abyss. Far below, a river snakes through the canyon, its surface shimmering in the fading light. The sight terrifies me, yet I feel a strange sense of exhilaration, too.

The pounding continues, growing softer now but still present. I realize it’s the rhythm of my own heart, urging me to take the next step. Slowly, my foot touches the bridge. The wood creaks beneath my weight, and I freeze, momentarily paralyzed by fear. The amber-eyed man’s words echo in my mind: “Are you ready?” 

The wind lashes at my face, stinging my cheeks, yet something in me refuses to turn back. I take another step, then another, each one harder than the last. Yet with each movement, the pounding in my chest seems to calm, as if the fear is being replaced by determination.

As I continue to cross the bridge, I realize the canyon isn’t just a physical space but a void I’ve been avoiding in my waking life. The deeper I venture, the more I see the shadows of my doubts, fears, and unspoken hopes waiting to be explored.

I take one final step and suddenly, I’m on the other side. The canyon falls away, replaced by a lush, green field that stretches as far as the eye can see. The amber-eyed man stands there, waiting. He smiles warmly, his face softened now. “You’ve crossed the first bridge,” he says. 

Then the dream fades, leaving only the faint echo of that rhythmic pounding, a reminder that the journey has just begun.
