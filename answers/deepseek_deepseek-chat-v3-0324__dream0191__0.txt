I am dreaming. The cave walls press in around me, jagged and glistening with unseen moisture. My flickering lantern, already weak from hours of exploration, sputters violently as the earthquake sends shudders through the earth. A sickening *crunch* echoes through the cavern as the tunnel behind me collapses in a roaring cascade of rock and dust, sealing me inside. The light dims—just a few more heartbeats left before darkness swallows me whole.  

I crouch low, my breath ragged, feeling the cold, damp air lick at my skin. The last flicker of the lantern gutters out, plunging me into a black so absolute it feels alive. It coils around me, whispering thoughts of hunger, of the deep things that have never known light. My fingers dig into the stone floor, searching for some anchor in this void.  

Then—  

A slow, rhythmic sound reaches me. *Drip. Drip. Drip.* Not water, but something thicker, heavier, resonating as if from the throat of the earth itself. A faint glow pulses ahead, soft and sickly green, illuminating the cavern in sporadic waves. The walls seem to *breathe*—shifting, undulating like living tissue. Stalactites twist as if they might unroot and slither away.  

And I see it.  

A gaping maw in the stone, eerily oval, lined with something wet and glistening. It exhales, a sour wind carrying the scent of old blood and rusted metal. The green light flickers again—and two slitted pupils, each as wide as a man’s hand, blink open in the darkness beyond the opening.  

Something moves. A shape too smooth, too deliberate to be rock. It watches me.  

And then—it **croons**, a sound that vibrates in my bones like a memory of forgotten pain.  

I scramble backward, gasping, but there is nowhere to go. The exit is gone. The cave is alive. And it knows I’m here.  

The glow intensifies. The thing in the dark stretches forward, extending a single, skeletal limb—pale as dead roots, too many joints bending in impossible places—and for the first time, I know, with chilling certainty:  

The cave didn’t trap me. It *invited* me.  

And whatever waits inside has been hungry for a very, very long time.  

I wake up gasping—but the echo of that croon lingers in my ears, as if it followed me out.
