I am dreaming. ()  

The sky is a liquid opal, swirling with thoughts too ancient to have names, and the ground beneath my feet is made not of earth, but memory—cobblestones paved with echoes of laughter, regret, broken promises, and first kisses. I hover slightly above the surface, as though gravity isn’t sure whether to claim me or let me slip into the ether.

Before me stands a crossroad—not of roads, but of realities. One path is gleaming gold, stitched with threads of convenience, security, and comfort. It winds through a land of easy answers, where every question has a checkbox and success is a tidy form signed in triplicate. The other path shimmers in deep indigo, crooked and wild, overgrown with thorns of disapproval and haunted by the uneasy ghosts of 'what if?'.  

Following the first path would mean turning away from something I *know* in my marrow—some unspoken truth I was born carrying, though I have never voiced it out loud. It would mean choosing prosperity over integrity, assimilation over identity. There would be applause. There would be silence, too, but the kind people confuse for peace.  

The second path… it hums. It calls not with promises, but with possibility. There’s hunger there. Uncertainty. Danger that does not wear a mask, because it has no need to. But it also holds freedom—raw, trembling freedom. The kind that breathes fire into everything dead inside me.  

I stand at this junction for hours, or perhaps seconds, I cannot tell. Time here dances backward when it isn’t being watched.  

A voice speaks—not outside me, but within the hollow of my chest, where courage lives when it’s not afraid.  
**"What is it you value most when no one is watching? When you have nothing to prove and nothing left to lose?"**  

The air shivers. The golden road glimmers seductively, whispering that survival is a virtue all its own. But as I look more closely, I see hollowness behind the shine—children fed on riches but starved of wonder, houses built like cages for the soul, promises worn like costumes in a play with no meaning. It is a world where I fit neatly, but always on someone else’s terms.  

Then I look to the indigo road. My soul exhales. It feels like stepping into a storm and realizing—you were the storm all along.  

I choose.  

With the choice, the sky flares—shattering into a thousand luminous birds, each carrying a sliver of fate. I step forward and the road rises to meet me, soft as velvet and sharp as truth. I feel the wind tear at my illusions and something inside me opens that had been locked for so long I forgot the key was mine.  

As I walk, shadows whisper—but they are not threats. They are old fears, afraid to lose me.  

I dream not of escape, but of awakening.  
I dream not of comfort, but of deep and daring truth.  
And in this dream, I am not two things—practical or principled—I am one, wild, impossibly human soul walking the path only I can walk.  

And the universe watches, breathless, as I dare to take another step.
