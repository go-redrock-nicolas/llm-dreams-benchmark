I am dreaming. ....

I find myself standing at the edge of a room that seems to breathe - its walls pulsing with an iridescent glow that shifts between deep indigo and burning gold. Before me lies a spiral staircase made of what appears to be liquid glass, each step rippling like disturbed water yet somehow maintaining its form. My heart pounds against my ribs as I recognize this place from somewhere deep in my subconscious - it's the manifestation of every challenge I've ever retreated from.

The air grows thick with whispers, voices that seem to emerge from the very molecules around me, speaking truths I've long tried to silence. Each step I take backward causes the room to contract, the walls inching closer with deliberate persistence. I feel the familiar tightness in my chest, that primal urge to turn and flee, to seek the comfort of familiar shadows.

But something is different this time. The floor beneath my feet begins to glow with ancient symbols that pulse in rhythm with my heartbeat. Each symbol seems to tell a story of past moments when fear won, when avoidance triumphed over growth. As I watch, these symbols begin to rise from the floor, floating like luminous fireflies, forming a path up the liquid glass staircase.

My body trembles, but my feet move forward of their own accord. As I place my foot on the first step, it solidifies beneath me, transforming from trembling liquid to solid crystal. Each subsequent step brings with it a wave of memories - times I chose comfort over courage, silence over speech, hiding over showing up.

The whispers grow louder, but they're no longer threatening. They're encouraging, millions of voices merging into a harmonious chorus that seems to say "Through, not away. Through, not away." The walls have stopped their advance, now swirling with colors that paint stories of triumph and transformation.

As I ascend higher, each step becomes easier than the last. The fear doesn't disappear, but it transforms into something else - a kind of electric anticipation, a recognition that discomfort isn't a warning to retreat, but a signal of imminent growth. At the top of the staircase, a door made of pure light awaits, its edges undefined and shifting, representing every opportunity I've yet to embrace.

My hand reaches for the handle, and as my fingers make contact, I feel a surge of understanding course through my body: avoidance has been my prison, and facing my fears is the key to my freedom. The door swings open, flooding the space with blinding light, and I step through...

The dream begins to fade, but the lesson remains etched in my consciousness: The path through discomfort leads to transformation, while the path of avoidance leads only to more of the same.
