I am dreaming. A world unfolds before me, one where the blue pressurizes and swallows.  I drift through a vibrant coral garden that evolves into a cave system—vast arches of stone sculpted over eons by the ancient breath of the sea. The water is crisp and strangely clear, revealing golden algae undulating like oceanic auroras. Schools of translucent fish shimmer around me as I descend deeper, my pulse quiet in my ears—a metronome syncing with the rhythm of currents above.  Then, without warning, my oxygen valve begins to hiss.  I spin, frantic, twisting at the regulator on my tank, only to discover it’s not a leak—it’s a heartbeat—a living thing fused to the metal, pulsing and squirming with grotesque purpose.  I pull away, but the tank is *anchored*, tentacles reaching deep into my suit, knotting around my spine.  I scream, but the regulator just gives me air, and then it *laughs*, a bubbling, gurgling sound that fills my ears with dread.

I kick backwards, trying to flee, but the passage behind me erupts in a deafening collapse. Stone tears free from unseen supports, crashing into the water with the gravity of fate. The cave shifts, groaning as if waking from eons of slumber. Shadows twist impossibly in the beam from my dive light, and I begin to notice patterns—a massive, submerged tree, its roots punching through the rock with determination, sap glistening amber in the filtered, dreamlike light.  The tree is not just in the cave walls, but part of them. Embedded. *Cosmic in scale and impossible in shape*, its branches stretch higher than sight allows, vanishing into undulating black. The water itself begins to hum in tones beyond sound, resonating with my bones.  Just past the tree, a gaping crevice emits soft glowing light, swirling like churning milk. With my oxygen sputtering and panic tightening around my ribs, I move toward it—not out of choice, but drawn by something older than fear.

You are drawn toward the soft glow eminating from the crevice. It pulses gently, like a heartbeat, and the water temperature begins to rise. Not uncomfortably so; it feels, if anything, like being submerged in memory. As you approach, you notice *writing* etched into the stone, the kind that spirals inward and never finds a center. Your fingers trace the glyphs as you weigh the options—you can attempt one last desperate ascent through the passageway now blocked, or swim into the glacial crevice—into the **luminous unknown**.

Are you ready to swim towards the crevice?

>Select:
**A) Try to clear the passageway by swimming back through the collapsed cave entrance.**
**B) Swim deeper into the glowing crevice, its light expanding the closer you get.**
