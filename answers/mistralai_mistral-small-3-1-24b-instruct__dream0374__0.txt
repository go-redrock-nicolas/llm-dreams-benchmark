I am dreaming. The scene unfolds in a grand, opulent theater, the air thick with anticipation and the scent of aged wood and velvet. The stage is bathed in a warm, golden light, and the audience is a sea of faces, all turned towards the spotlight, which illuminates a figure standing center stage. It's someone I know, someone I've worked closely with, but the applause and admiration are directed solely at them. I can feel the weight of my own contributions, heavy and unacknowledged, like a stone in my chest.

The theater is a whirlwind of color and sound, a stark contrast to the quiet, unnoticed effort I've poured into the project. The curtains are a deep, royal red, adorned with intricate gold embroidery that shimmers under the stage lights. The audience is dressed in their finest, a kaleidoscope of silk and satin, jewels sparkling like fallen stars. Yet, amidst this vibrant spectacle, I feel invisible, my presence unnoticed, my contributions unacknowledged.

The figure on stage is accepting a gleaming trophy, their face alight with pride and triumph. I can see the sweat on their brow, the slight tremor in their hands, the same signs of hard work that I've seen in my own reflection. But the applause, the admiration, the recognition—it's all for them. I can feel a knot forming in my stomach, a tangled mix of pride for their achievement and a sharp, stinging sense of injustice.

The theater seems to grow darker, the lights dimming as if to highlight my feelings of being overlooked. The stone in my chest grows heavier, pressing down on my heart. I want to stand up, to shout out my contributions, to claim my share of the recognition. But my body feels rooted to the spot, my voice stuck in my throat.

Suddenly, the spotlight shifts, and for a moment, it's on me. The theater falls silent, the air thick with tension. I can feel the weight of every eye in the room, the pressure of every expectation. But then, just as quickly, the light fades, and the applause begins again, louder and more fervent than before. The figure on stage beams, basking in the adoration, and I'm left in the shadows, my unacknowledged effort a silent, unnoticed ghost in the room.

The dream shifts, the theater melting away to reveal a stark, empty stage. I'm alone now, the applause a distant echo. The stone in my chest is gone, replaced by a hollow emptiness. I look down at my hands, seeing the calluses, the signs of hard work. I know my contributions are real, tangible. But in this dream, they're unacknowledged, unseen.

Yet, amidst the emptiness, there's a spark. A small, defiant flame burning in the darkness. It's a reminder that my work, my effort, my contributions—they're mine. They can't be taken away, can't be overshadowed, no matter how bright the spotlight on someone else. And with that spark, the dream begins to fade, the stage dissolving into a swirl of colors, leaving me with a sense of quiet resolve. I may not have received the recognition I deserved in this dream, but I know, deep down, that my work speaks for itself. And that, in the end, is all that truly matters.
