I am dreaming. Prows of mountains of crystal stretch impossibly into the air, their jagged peaks piercing heavens painted in swirling hues of sapphire and amethyst. Each spire reflects light in dazzling prismatic patterns, casting rainbow shadows across the glittering ground below.

Deep within a valley nestled between these glassy sentinels, a pool of silvery water runs like quicksilver over black stone. The surface of this mysterious lake shivers and undulates, though there is no apparent breeze. Occasionally, puffs of golden smoke burst from the surface in perfect spheres, each dissipating into glittering motes that drift lazily upward.

Around the pool's edge, great trees unlike any known in the waking world reach skyward, their trunks composed of living obsidian and their leaves an ethereal dance of iridescent feathers. The air beneath their branches thrums with an otherworldly music - not quite audible, but sensed through the skin rather than the ears.

A pathway of opalescent butterflies weaves between the trees, their delicate wings leaving trails of luminescent dust in their wake. These butterflies seem drawn to a particular spot near the pool's edge, where they gather in swirling patterns before dissolving into streams of light.

In the center of the lake, something stirs beneath the surface. Ripples spread outward in concentric patterns, each one growing larger than the last until they reach the shore. The water then rises into the air in a perfect sphere, joining the golden smoke clouds still floating upward. Within this sphere, an ancient scroll of pulsing parchment is visible, its surface covered in glowing symbols that shift and change even as they are beheld.
