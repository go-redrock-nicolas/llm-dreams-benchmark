I am dreaming. The moon is full and low in the sky, casting long shadows across a labyrinth of crumbling stone walls.  The air smells of damp earth and wild thyme.  I don't know how I got here, but I know I need to navigate this maze before sunrise.  My hands tremble as I touch the cold stones, sensing they pulse faintly like dormant hearts.  Twin obstacles manifest—first, a sheer wall rising twenty feet high, blocking my path, then a chasm splitting the earth where the path should continue. I hear whispers from the shadows.  .  You are capable.  You've always been. My grandmother's voice in Telugu, though she died years ago. I close my eyes. When I breathe out, silver light courses through my veins. The wall becomes climbable, glowing handholds appearing where none existed. The chasm? I realize it's an illusion when my foot finds solid ground. But something primal stirs in the maze's center. I walk toward it anyway.
I am running now. Not from fear, but toward the thick velvet hum vibrating beneath my ribs. The maze walls blur as I pass, lichen cracking off stones that now bow inward as if making reverence. My shadow stretches ahead, merging with a colossal silhouette rising at the labyrinth's heart—a willow tree with bark like molten mercury, its cascading branches chiming glass leaves in a wind I cannot feel. A presence gathers in its boughs. I know without knowing: This is the shape of my avoidance. The self I folded and buried beneath practicality. Its amber eyes open—my eyes—and it roars through the roots into my bones.  

Liquid moonlight pools in my palms. I let it crystalize into twin sickles curved like new moons. We circle. When it lunges, I *become* the gap it tries to cross—fracturing into starlings that swarm its limbs before coalescing blade-first through its core. It dissipates like fog, leaving warmth where dread once lived. The willow bursts into bioluminescent blossoms that drift upward, rewriting constellations. I wake with soil under my nails and the scent of petrichor clinging to my sheets. My alarm clock blinks 3:33 AM. When I flex my hand, a single glass leaf glints on my palm before dissolving into vapor.
