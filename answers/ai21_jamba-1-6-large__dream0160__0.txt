Brian Reeves' Dream
================================================================================

### message

In my dream, I come to the realization that it's actually all over. All of it. There are no more possibilities. There are no more twists—just my eyes opening to the purest form of the truth: my professional journey has reached its end.

I awaken with a jolt, gasping and drenched in sweat. I should feel dread, or maybe even relief, but all I feel is the ache in my lungs because I stopped breathing. I blink slowly, the sight before me swimming into focus: the cold, dimly lit locker room of a familiar stadium. Immaculately polished cleats are scattered across the floor. Someone’s jersey hangs from a hook, the team crest barely visible through the steam of my labored breathing. The faint smell of sweat, blood, and adrenaline lingers, shifting between pungent and bittersweet.

Confused, I rise to my feet, my movements stiff as if bracing for the worst. Yet I can’t place exactly what moment this is. I’m wearing my uniform—imbued with years of effort and failure, the crest on my chest heavy—and my boots are on. Was I benched? Am I here to make an announcement? Or has something else happened, something so cataclysmic that everyone already knew but didn’t dare tell me until this moment?

I push through the locker room door. Outside is a vast stadium. Row upon row of seats rise up in every direction, stretching into a horizon that feels endless. The lights above blind me, forcing my hand up to shield my eyes. But something is wrong. There are no fans, and even the turf beneath my feet is silent, like it’s waiting for me to speak.

I turn to see my teammates. They sit on the bench, looking like ghosts, each slouched forward with heads hanging low. I stride over to them, determined, fists clenching at my sides. My voice trembles as I speak: "What happened?"

Nick glances up at me, his expression hollow. "You know what happened," he says quietly. "They ended it. All of us."

I step forward, meeting each pair of empty eyes. "How can that be? There’s no way!" Jaden, Ava, and Luke avoid my gaze, shifting uncomfortably. My chest tightens, and I spin toward the sideline, where someone stands in the shadows.

"No!" I shout, my voice echoing into nothingness. "I need to speak to someone! There has to be another way!"

The figure steps forward, revealing an older version of myself. He looks tired but strangely at peace. "It’s done," he says softly. "And honestly? It was always going to end like this.”

I stare at him like he’s speaking a foreign language. I refuse to accept his words. "No," I repeat, louder this time, desperation clawing its way up my throat. "There’s always something, some kind of chance—even if it’s impossible, even if it’s just a spark!"

But Future Me slowly shakes his head. "Sometimes... it’s better to realize there was never any hope at all.”

The silence stretches on until it feels unbearable. "This can’t be the end," I whisper. My fists clench, and my voice trembles. "I’m not ready."

Old Me smiles faintly. "No one ever is," he says.

I close my eyes, my chest tightening once more. Silence envelopes the stadium. When I open them again, I am in those stands—forever suspended in that terrifying void between what could have been and nothing left to be.

I jolt awake again. My hand instinctively presses against my chest, where my heart pounds like a drum against my ribs. I glance around. Darkness surrounds me, and the sheets cling to my body like they’re trying to drag me back into that place.

That day has not arrived. That day has not arrived.

But the fear lingers. The fear whispers that every day forward might be the one where I face that ultimate destruction. The day when the lights go out.
