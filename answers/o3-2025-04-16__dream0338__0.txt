I am dreaming. …stand still for a heartbeat that stretches into eternity, the world around you trembling with possibility.

The night sky overhead is a churning ocean of amethyst clouds, veined with restless silver lightning that never quite strikes. The crossroads itself is carved into a floating mesa of obsidian that hovers high above a bottomless void. All around, gravity is indecisive: fragments of marble columns drift lazily like feathers, lanterns of liquid starlight bob in invisible currents, and somewhere far below, a lone cathedral bell tolls even though there is no cathedral, only its echo folded into the darkness.

Two paths await you, glowing in colors that seem almost impossible:

1. The Path of Blossoming Hours  
   A ribbon-wide walkway of translucent jade winds off to the left. At its very edges, iridescent petals unfurl, breathing out motes of emerald light that tinkle like tiny glass chimes. Each footstep on this path becomes a ripple of music—harp-strings plucked by invisible fingers. On the horizon stands a titanic tree made of dawn itself: its trunk is woven from strands of sunrise pink; its leaves are shifting panes of molten gold that flutter and whistle like birds. Rumor inside your pulse says that should you reach that tree, every memory you've loved but lost will bloom anew as living flowers, and you will drink their scent to remember all you once were. But the cost, whispered by the bells buried in those petals, is that you may forget the very reasons you ever yearned for something more.

2. The Path of Shattered Midnight  
   To the right stretches a road of obsidian mirrors, fractured yet unbroken, shards held together by threads of cobalt lightning. With every step, the mirrored surface reflects not your body but your possible selves: versions of you that laughed louder, cried harder, burned brighter, or faded sooner. Above the path whirl constellations made of ink, spilling comets that hiss like serpents. At its end looms a fortress of black crystal, its windows ablaze with cold sapphire fire. Legends engraved on the air promise that inside this keep you might seize the power to reshape every future—yours, and those entwined with you—at a single whisper. Yet the echo of those same legends warns that to wield such command means submitting to an endless reckoning with everything you have broken, or ever will.

Between the two paths, hovering at eye level, is a lantern fashioned from a single teardrop of moonlight. Inside it dances a candle-flame shaped like a question mark. Every few seconds, it flickers into a different color—rose, turquoise, lavender—each hue a silent invitation. You sense that if you lift the lantern, time will freeze until you decide, but if you leave it behind, the decision will be irrevocable the moment you take a single step.

Around you, the floating ruins murmur ancient lullabies. A wind smelling of rain on parchment tries to coax you toward the jade walkway. At the same time, a low drumbeat—slow, like a giant’s heartbeat—throbs beneath the obsidian mirrors, calling you to the crystal fortress. Your palms tingle; your thoughts hum like tuning forks; you feel the dream watching you, waiting to be authored.

What do you do?

Do you reach for the lantern, seeking a pause, a breath, a moment to parse every possible consequence?

Or do you choose swiftly—left toward budding memories reborn in light, right toward midnight power and responsibility?

The silence thrums, ripe with thunder and blossoms and shattered reflections. The next motion you make will rewrite the dream’s laws…

…and the crossroads, holding its breath, bends closer to hear your answer.
