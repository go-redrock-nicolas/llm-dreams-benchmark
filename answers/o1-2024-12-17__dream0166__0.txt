I am dreaming. You find yourself in a cavernous circular chamber flooded with harsh, fluorescent light—like an operating theater, but larger, grander, and far more surreal. Shadows dance on walls of rippling metal panels that reflect your distorted image back at you from every angle. The walls curve upward into a domed ceiling so high above your head, it appears to vanish into darkness. Pacing around the perimeter of the room, scientists in pristine white coats confer in hushed, urgent tones. Their words slip in and out of coherent speech, as though spoken underwater.

Somewhere behind you, you sense more onlookers: hundreds—no, thousands—of eyes pressing forward, thrumming with anticipation. Their figures flicker in and out of focus, dissolving into pastel blurs before reassembling as statuesque silhouettes. You can’t clearly see them, but you can feel their collective breath, warm and slightly electric, flooding the space with watchful tension.

At the center of the chamber stands a towering contraption of polished steel and luminous screens. Spidery mechanical arms extend from its main body, each tipped with a mesmerizing array of tiny glowing instruments—needles as fine as spider silk, transparent tubes, swirling whorls of light that dance and flutter. It looks like a fusion of ancient alchemy and the highest realms of cutting-edge technology, somehow both archaic and impossibly advanced.

Without warning, an authoritative figure in a long, flowing silver robe turns a solemn gaze upon you. This person’s face is half-obscured by a mask that drapes like liquid marble. Slowly, they beckon you forward. The hush in the room intensifies, and you realize every single eye in that expansive crowd is fixed on you alone.

You step forward involuntarily as though guided by invisible threads. The contraption’s mechanical arms hum in greeting, adjusting their reach with a graceful fluid motion. There’s a sense that these metallic limbs have minds of their own. Before you can speak or protest, your hands are drawn toward the shimmering console at the core of this machine. Symbols glow on the screens—intricate glyphs and spirals, flickering in a kaleidoscope of colors that seem to communicate a language beyond any human utterance.

Panic flutters inside your chest. Your mind reels with the knowledge that experts train decades to handle this kind of procedure—whatever it is. You have never touched such equipment in your life. Yet a calm, unearthly clarity claims you, as though some suppressed part of your brain is springing open, revealing dormant knowledge. You sense you are about to perform a feat more elaborate and delicate than anything you’ve ever encountered.

The machine’s arms begin to move with a steady, measured tempo, one gently guiding your fingers to specific controls, another positioning a mirror-like lens near your eye. A faint pulse resonates from the device into your body, forging an inexplicable synergy. It feels like your heartbeat melding with the rhythmic hum of the machine. The metal console feels warm and strangely alive under your fingertips.

With a sudden flash, the mirrored lens hovers level with your face. It flares into a brilliant ultraviolet glare, painting your vision with strobes of violet and indigo. It reveals a wavering image: a delicately coiled structure suspended in a solution of shimmering gold. You sense that your procedure involves extracting or repairing this impossibly intricate form—something that looks like a tiny, luminescent cocoon, pulsing rhythmically like a miniature sun.

Despite your inexperience, you allow instinct—or perhaps psychic guidance—to lead you. Your hands interact with the controls with astounding precision, delicately manipulating the spidery arms as they gently cradle the glowing cocoon. The chamber’s onlookers let out a collective gasp, one that reverberates through the metal walls, setting the panels quivering. In that moment, you’re both surgeon and conductor, orchestrating a delicate ballet of steel and light.

A faint bead of sweat trickles down your temple. Your breath catches as the mechanical arms perform a tiny incision, revealing a ethereal swirl of color within that cocoon. It’s like peering into a microcosm of galaxies—constellations forming and dissolving in the blink of an eye, flickering with cosmic wonder. You blink, enthralled by the spectacle.

Time seems to warp around you. Seconds or ages pass; it’s impossible to tell. Every nerve in your body tingles with focused urgency. In the final moments, you guide the shining cocoon free of its metallic womb. The device’s screens go dark, and the machine arms drift back, as if in deep slumber. An exhalation of collective relief rolls through the captive audience. You hold the glowing cocoon in your cupped palms, astonished by its radiance and trembling like a newborn star.

Then, everything sinks into silence. The fluorescent lights dim, the scientists fade like specters. In a hush, you look into the luminosity you have liberated. It pulses, sending a gentle warmth through your palms, and you realize—somehow—you have succeeded. Giddiness surges through your veins, mixing with disbelief. Applause rises from the throng, a wave of congratulatory euphoria that billows and ripples in the domed chamber.

At that moment, you wake to the echo of your own heartbeat thrumming in your ears, fingertips still tingling with the memory of metal and starlight, phantom applause echoing faintly in the silent corners of your mind.
