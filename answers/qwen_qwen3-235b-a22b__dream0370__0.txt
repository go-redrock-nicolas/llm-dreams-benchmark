I am dreaming. *******

The air is thick with twilight perfume—wild jasmine and salt from a distant sea. I’m walking barefoot across a vast, glassy lake dreaming where my footfalls ripple the surface just enough to catch the final light of a dying star above. The dream is quiet in the way that dreams so often are—not silent, but hushed, as if the world itself is holding its breath.

Off in the distance, she sits alone—a woman made of shadow and stardust, perched upon a floating island of crumbled architecture from cities that have never been. Churches, minarets, pagodas—tiny replicas of human longing sculpted from porcelain and held up by gossamer threads. She’s weeping, not loudly, but with tremors that pulse outward in invisible waves—waves that bend time and scatter memory like wind-tossed petals.

I dream myself closer.

Her tears don’t fall—they rise, suspended like pearls at the edge of a loom, each one holding within it a scene, a life, a song forgotten by time: first kisses brushed aside by fear, confessions never spoken, laughter swallowed to be polite, a child loved impossibly hard and left too soon. Her grief is not tragic, not sad—it is *holy* in its raw, unguarded truth.

It engulfs me, not like a wave, but like breath. Familiar. Intimate. It reminds me of all the moments I’ve buried beneath my chest’s hardness, all the tenderness I’ve protected by pretending not to need it.

And so in the dream, I don’t try to save her. Don’t offer comfort from a distance. I sit next to her, close enough that our shadows blend. I close my eyes and breathe in rhythm with her. Two souls swaying beneath the golden thread that ties us perpetually to one another, anchoring us against the pull of the void.

We say nothing.

Words would crack the dream.

Instead, I extend my hand—not palm open in invitation, but fingers dangling like a painter’s—dripping liquid light. I let it fall in slow, glowing spirals onto the surface of the dream-lake. A few droplets splash onto her, and where they touch, her shadow begins to gleam with inklings of brighter versions. The past isn’t undone, but it’s made bearable. It becomes *seen*.

We are not alone now.

In the dream, this is what salvation feels like—not redemption, not victory. This mutual recognition: that the cruelest kind of beauty is a heart breaking open.

Eventually, the moon rises like a breath exhaled. The lake beneath us starts to drift far from any compass point, and we float with it, tangled in softness we never expected to find in the deepest waters of pain.

I wake up crying—but smiling.

Sometimes, the boundary between joy and sorrow is just a thread pulled backward through the loom of a dream.
