I am dreaming. The air in the examination hall hums with an otherworldly energy, thick and heavy like molasses, yet somehow vibrant with anticipation. Towering stained-glass windows, depicting elaborate celestial maps and mythical creatures locked in cosmic battles, cast kaleidoscopic patterns across the rows of ornate,
velvet-cushioned chairs. Each chair seems to pulse with a faint inner light, as if occupied by unseen spirits whispering encouragement or doubt.

My heart hammers against my ribs like a trapped bird, its frantic rhythm echoing the ticking of an enormous, gear-driven clock that dominates the far wall. This clock isn't just measuring time; its hands sweep across constellations, its pendulum swings through miniature nebulae, marking the passage of eons rather than mere minutes. This exam, I understand with a certainty that transcends logic, isn't just about a career – it's about my very destiny, a pivotal moment woven into the fabric of my existence.

I finally locate my assigned seat, a magnificent throne-like chair carved from what looks like petrified starlight. The desk before me isn't wood or metal, but a smooth, cool slab of obsidian that reflects the swirling colours from the windows like a dark mirror. As I settle in, the velvet cushion sighs beneath me, conforming perfectly to my form, disturbingly comfortable yet profoundly alien.

The exam paper materializes on the obsidian surface, not delivered by any proctor, but seemingly coalescing from the ambient light itself. It shimmers, the parchment glowing with a soft, internal luminescence. My breath catches in my throat. I reach out, my fingers trembling, the paper feeling strangely warm and alive beneath my touch.

But as my eyes focus on the questions, a bewildering chill snakes down my spine, freezing the initial warmth. The neat, calligraphic script begins to… **writhe**.

The letters twist and squirm like a nest of newly hatched serpents, detaching themselves from the page only to reassemble into impossible, shifting glyphs that pulse with colours I've never seen before – colours that seem to vibrate at the edge of perception, hinting at spectra beyond human comprehension. They aren’t questions in any language I know, or any language that *could* exist in the waking world. They feel ancient, primal, like the universe itself is posing riddles whispered in the static hiss between galaxies.

One moment, a question seems to be a complex equation involving floating, iridescent spheres and singing triangles; the next, it morphs into a flowing, lyrical poem written in liquid moonlight, describing the taste of forgotten emotions. Another section presents itself as a tactile challenge: raised, Braille-like patterns shift beneath my fingertips, forming miniature, intricate landscapes that I must somehow navigate or interpret – a mountain range sculpted from solidified echoes, a river flowing with liquid time.

Panic begins to bloom in my chest, a cold flower unfurling its petals. How can I answer this? How can I possibly comprehend what is being asked? The symbols mock my knowledge, my preparation, everything I thought I understood. They demand not answers learned from books, but insights gleaned from the resonance of my own soul, interpretations of dreams I haven't yet had, and mastery over concepts that feel both intimately familiar and terrifyingly alien.

The clock on the wall chimes, not with bells, but with a sound like shattering crystal and distant whale song, the reverberations shaking the very air I breathe. The exam has begun, and the questions continue their mesmerizing, maddening dance, challenging me to decipher the very language of existence itself, written in the shifting ink of the cosmos. I am adrift in a sea of profound, beautiful, and utterly terrifying unknowns, the weight of my future pressing down not like a burden, but like the gravity of a newly forming star.
