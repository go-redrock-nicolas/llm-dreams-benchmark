I am dreaming. (continue)

**The Dream of the Glass Bridge**  

In the heart of a twilight valley suspended between sky and earth, a bridge of pure crystal stretches across an abyss so deep it seems to drink the stars. The air hums with the tension of unspoken words, and below, the darkness ripples like liquid shadow, swallowing echoes.  

Two groups stand on opposite ends—one robed in silver, their voices like chimes, speaking of unity as the only truth. The other is cloaked in ember-hued garments, their words sharp as flint, declaring individuality the highest law. Between them, the bridge shudders, its surface fracturing with each disagreement, cracks spreading like veins of lightning.  

You stand at the center, barefoot on the cool glass, feeling every fissure beneath your feet. The bridge is alive—not just a path, but a thing that *listens*, translating their arguments into colors that bloom and fade: violet when they speak of sacrifice, crimson when they demand freedom.  

A voice whispers from the abyss: *"Let them see."*  

You press your palms to the bridge. At your touch, the glass turns to liquid mirror, reflecting not just faces, but *histories*—the silver-robed elder as a child, abandoned by those who feared her strangeness; the fire-cloaked leader weeping as his village burned beneath a banner of "greater good."  

For a breath, there is silence. The reflections ripple, truths too heavy to deny. Then, something shifts—not in the words, but in the pauses between them. The cracks begin to mend, not into smooth uniformity, but into a mosaic, each fracture filled with molten gold. *Kintsugi.*  

The dream shudders, and you wake—not with answers, but with the echo of a bridge that refused to break.
