I am dreaming. And in this dream, the world is alive with chaos, a place where reality itself breathes and twists like a living thing.  

The sky above me is a swirling tapestry of fractured colors—indigo bleeding into molten gold, then splitting apart like shattered glass to reveal a void where stars pulse like distant, watching eyes. The ground beneath my feet is not solid but undulating, a living membrane that ripples with each step, as if I walk upon the skin of some vast, slumbering beast.  

Gravity is a fickle companion. One moment, I am anchored, my feet pressing into the soft earth. The next, I am weightless, drifting upward as the world tilts, and suddenly *down* is sideways. I reach for a tree—only to watch its branches stretch away from me like retreating fingers, the bark peeling back to reveal veins of liquid light. Time stutters. A butterfly flits past, its wings leaving trails of shimmering dust that hang in the air, frozen, before suddenly accelerating into a blur.  

To drink from a nearby stream, I must first negotiate with the water. It does not flow in one direction but in spirals, pooling midair before cascading backward, defying its own nature. The liquid is cool and sweet, but as I swallow, I taste memories—not my own—flashes of a forgotten city sinking beneath an ocean of stars.  

To eat, I must find fruit that exists only when I am not looking. It appears in the corner of my vision, dangling from branches that twist away when I turn my head. I learn to pluck it blindly, my fingers closing around something that feels like both peach and stone, its flesh humming with a quiet melody.  

Survival here is a dance with madness. To move forward, I must sometimes walk sideways. To speak, I must shape words with my hands instead of my voice, for sound unravels here, becoming color, becoming scent. The wind carries whispers in languages that have no names, and sometimes, when the air grows still, I hear my own thoughts echoed back to me—but in reverse, as if time itself is laughing.  

And yet, beneath the chaos, there is a pattern. A rhythm. The world breathes, and if I still my own breath, if I let my heartbeat sync with the pulse of this place, I can almost sense the hidden logic—the dream’s secret design.  

But then, just as I begin to understand, the ground opens beneath me, and I am falling—not down, but *through*, into another layer of the dream, where the rules have changed again.  

And I awaken—or do I?
