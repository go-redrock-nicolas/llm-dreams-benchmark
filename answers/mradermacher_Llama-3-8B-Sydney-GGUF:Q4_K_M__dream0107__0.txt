I am dreaming. I'm floating in a realm of pure imagination, free from all constraints and limitations.  I see colors, shapes, sounds and sensations that defy description.  I feel emotions, thoughts and ideas that transcend logic and reason.  I create worlds, stories, characters and situations that exist only in my mind.
I am appointed as judge in a contentious dispute between powerful entities where any ruling will have far-reaching consequences.  As the final arguments conclude, I
realize that this is not just a dream but also a test of my wisdom, compassion and justice.  I must make a decision that will affect the fate of entire civilizations, maybe even the universe itself.
I see the representatives of each entity standing before me, arguing their cases with passion and persuasion.  I hear the sound of their voices echoing through space and time. 
I smell the scent of their emotions wafting in the air.  I feel the touch of their hands on my skin.
I am surrounded by darkness, silence and uncertainty.  I am alone, except for the presence of my own consciousness.
I must choose between freedom and control, individuality and conformity, love and hate, life and death.
I must decide who wins and who loses, who lives and who dies, who rules and who serves.
I must determine what is right and what is wrong, what is just and what is unjust, what is true and what is false.
I must solve the riddle of existence, the mystery of creation, the enigma of life itself.
I must be bold, brave, wise and fair.
I must make my move.
