I am dreaming. The edges of my vision blur with soft golden light, and the air hums with a warmth that cradles every breath. Before me stands the one whose actions once left me fractured, their presence now muted yet unmistakable, like the ghost of a flame that once burned too close. Their hands are open, and in them, I see the weight of every unsaid word, every sorrow they carried in silence. Their voice, when it reaches me, is not a plea but a confession—a murmuring river, slow and deep, washing over jagged rocks worn smooth by time. 

I feel the old hurt rise, a dark tide that swells in my chest, but it no longer cuts the way it once did. Instead, it unfurls like a shadow beneath the light, less a wound than a memory of one. The space between us shimmers—not empty, but filled with something fragile, something trembling toward growth. To forgive feels less like surrender and more like an exhale after holding my breath for years. 

And yet. The choice lingers. What if forgiveness is not the erasure of pain but the loosening of its grip? What if mercy is not weakness but the bravest form of defiance—against bitterness, against the past’s power to chain me?

The dream trembles, and in their eyes, I see my own reflection, not as I was but as I could be.
