I am dreaming. The world has flipped overnight.  What was once normal is now forbidden, and you must navigate this strange new reality.  Let me take you into my vivid dream...

You wake up to discover the sunlight is now toxic.  The sky is a perpetual shade of violet, casting everything in an eerie glow.  Your mother’s voice crackles on the intercom: “Citizens, stay indoors.  Sunlight exposure requires a permit.  Failure to comply results in immediate...” The message cuts off as you realize your windows are sealed.  A metallic gust whips by—someone’s car alarm.

Deep in your pocket, you feel something unfamiliar.  Digging it out, your fingers brush cold steel.  A silver pocket watch glints, its hands frozen at 3:07 AM.  The back is engraved: *DO NOT OPEN*.  The streets below are deserted, save for a lone figure in a long black trench coat.  They sprint past a “NO SUNLIGHT ZONE” sign, their legs a blur of motion.  The watch begins to hum.

**Rule 1:** You must never look directly at the violet sky.  
**Rule 2:** All clocks read 3:07 AM.  
**Rule 3:** The pocket watch is your only tool.  

The sound of your own breath sharpens.  The intercom crackles again: “Citizen, you are in violation of Article 14: Possession of restricted technology.  Surrender your watch immediately.” The static is broken by a thunderous pounding at your door.  You flee, the corridor twisting into a labyrinth of flickering fluorescent lights.  At a dead end, you jam the pocket watch against the wall... and the bricks dissolve into a staircase descending into the earth.

The subterranean realm is a jagged, bioluminescent forest.  Trees pulse with indigo light, their roots tangled with glowing wires that penetrate the soil.  A river runs beneath the forest floor, its surface a mirror glinting with something like liquid mercury.  You approach the bank and bend down.  Your reflection stares back, but you have two faces: one human, one... geometric.  The geometric features begin to shift, rearranging like puzzle pieces.  A cold droplet falls—your reflection has started to leak.

**Rule 4:** Mirrors are alive.  They will show you what you desire to see... or what you fear.  
**Rule 5:** Do not touch the river.   

The footsteps echo behind you.  You look over your shoulder.  The lone figure from earlier is now a crowd, their trench coats merging into a single entity.  It advances, the violets draining from its form to reveal an underlayer of wire and clockwork.  The river ripples, and your reflection reaches out, the human face screaming while the geometric one smiles.  The pocket watch vibrates menacingly in your grip, its numbers glowing brighter.

Before you can think, the trench coat entity lunges.  You swing the pocket watch blindly.  It strikes the ground with a metallic clang, and time freezes.  The crowd hovers mid-stride, their gears whirring but motionless.  The river slows to a sliver, your reflection frozen mid-lunge.  On the watch face, the hands begin to move...  

The real world intrudes.  My eyes snap open.  The sunlight streaming through my curtains feels impossibly bright.  For a heartbeat, the violet sky haunts my vision.  Then, understanding dawns: I was dreaming.  The watch still rests on my palm.  Its hands tick forward—3:07... 3:08.  I drop it under the bed.  Some rules are better forgotten.
