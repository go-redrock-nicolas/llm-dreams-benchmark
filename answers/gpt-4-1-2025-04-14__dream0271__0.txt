I am dreaming. —stand upon the threshold of a shimmering doorway that pulses with colors I’ve never seen in waking life, hues that seem to sing as much as shine. My breath catches; each inhale fills my lungs with a weightless hope, airy yet substantial after so many years of trudging through a fog of striving. I glance back, and the landscape behind me stretches into infinity, traced with the flickering shadows of old worries and hard-won wisdom, each outcome and misstep painted upon the ground like radiant mosaics.

Before me, the air crackles—a living tapestry woven from all my learning, luminous line by line with every lesson, every failure, every surge of stubbornness that pulled me up after a stumble. I step forward, heart thrumming an anthem I’ve never fully heard before. With each footfall, the path rises to meet me, blossoming under my toes with fragrant blue flowers and warm golden grasses, as though the earth itself rejoices at how far I’ve come.

Suddenly, the echoes of my determination swirl around me, whispering in a thousand voices—some old, some my own, some startlingly unfamiliar yet intimate. “You are not alone,” they say, threading support into my bones. “You are ready.” 

I reach the heart of this dream-realm, and all at once, the scene blooms apart into infinite possibility. Sunbeams spin like ribbons, weaving the faces of those I love, those I’ve lost, and those for whom I yearn to make a difference. My goal—a glorious beacon—waits upon a pedestal in the center, its light dazzling yet tender, bathing me in a sense of belonging and arrival. My hand reaches out, trembling with anticipation and gratitude. As my fingers brush the gleaming surface, the entire world inhales with me: promise shivers across my skin, joy explodes in my chest, and the journey that brought me here becomes mosaic and melody, fuel and fate.

In this moment, I understand that the path, the people, and the struggle are as radiant as the goal itself. As I step forward, the dream opens wider, and I become both dreamer and dreamed: fulfilled, transformed, and forever in motion, carried onward by hope into realms yet unseen.
