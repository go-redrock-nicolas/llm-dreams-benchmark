I am dreaming. You discover you have the ability to feel others' emotions as if they were your own.

When surrounded by a crowd experiencing various intense feelings, a web of emotions stretches across my mind like threads of a tapestry.

A fractured rainbow of joy, confusion, anger, and sorrow intertwines in my perception. Each individual is a comet, dragging their emotional charge as a glowing tail, brushing past my awareness like a kaleidoscopic whirlwind. My body becomes an antenna, heightened beyond measure, converting invisible waves into palpable sensations: a lover’s piercing heartbreak feels like a shard of cold glass slicing through my ribs; an artist’s ecstatic breakthrough lights my chest aflame with golden euphoria.

Some threads pull at my core with crushing weight, while others lift me, whispering that I am blessing and curse simultaneously. My breathing quickens, trapped in an endless feedback loop—I both absorb and amplify. I want to scream but cannot, my voice replaced by the collective hum of a thousand frequencies vibrating in unison.

As the dream deepens, I realize this is no static condition but a mutable one. The storm of emotions swells and breaks. New feelings rush in like waves, unstoppable yet cleansing. I learn to surf, pulling back when overwhelmed and leaning into the undertow when curiosity outweighs fear.
