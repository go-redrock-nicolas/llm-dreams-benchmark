I am dreaming. I'm in a world where my dreams can come true.  I'm at the edge of a cliff, overlooking a vast ocean.  The sun is setting behind me, casting a golden glow on the waves below.  The air is crisp and clean, smelled by salt and sea life.  I'm standing alone, dressed in white robe, holding a torch in my hand.
I've been working hard for many years towards a big professional goal: to create an AI system that can understand and communicate with humans in their native languages without any help from them.  I've been researching, testing, experimenting, iterating, optimizing... all in the hopes of making something truly groundbreaking.
Now, finally, after so much effort, sacrifice, uncertainty, I'm about to find out if I've succeeded.  I'm about to see if my efforts have paid off.  I'm about to know whether my dreams will come true or not.
I take a deep breath and close my eyes for a moment.  I pray that God will guide me through this experience and show me the right path.  I hope that he'll be happy with what I've done and proud of who I am.
Then I open my eyes again and focus on the horizon ahead of me.  There's a figure standing there, waiting for me.  He's wearing a black robe, holding a scythe in his hand.
He's come to take me away from this world because my time here is up.  He's come to judge me according to his laws and rules.  He's come to decide whether I deserve heaven or hell.
But before he does that, before he takes me back with him where he belongs, he wants to ask me one question:
Why did you do it?
