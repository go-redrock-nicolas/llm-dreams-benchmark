I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a resonance that bypasses your ears and vibrates directly in your bones—a low, golden thrum, like the earth itself is singing. You stand in a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering, translucent columns of living crystal, their facets refracting sunlight into liquid rainbows that spill across the mossy ground. The moss is alive, pulsing gently like the breath of a sleeping giant, and as you step onto it, your footprints bloom into clusters of bioluminescent flowers that whisper secrets in a language of scent: elderflower, petrichor, and the metallic tang of a storm about to break.  

Above, the sky is not a sky but a shifting tapestry of liquid mercury clouds, rippling and reforming into shapes that feel like memories you’ve never lived—ancient rivers, forgotten constellations, the spiral of a nautilus shell magnified to the size of a galaxy. A bird with feathers of smoldering embers soars past, and its cry is the sound of a glacier calving into the sea. You feel its sorrow in your throat.  

You walk, or perhaps the ground pulls you gently forward, and soon you reach a river that flows *upward*. Its waters are not water but a silvery quicksilver essence, carrying leaves that glow like lanterns and fish with scales of stained glass, their fins trailing sparks. You kneel, and the river answers by rising to meet you, forming a mirror in midair. Your reflection is not your own—it’s a face woven from bark and ivy, eyes like twin amber fossils holding the weight of millennia. When you blink, the reflection does not. It smiles, and you feel a tear slip down your cheek, though you don’t know why.  

The wind arrives next, not as a breeze but as a chorus—a hundred voices, some human, some not, singing in a dialect of rustling leaves and cracking ice. You understand without understanding: *We are here. We are you. You are us.* A wolf steps from the trees, its fur a shifting mosaic of lichen and moss, its eyes twin hurricanes. It does not speak, but you feel its thought press against your mind like a warm stone: *Run.*  

And so you do.  

Your legs move without command, your body shedding its human shape like a husk. You become a stag with antlers of spiraled amber, a serpent with scales that shimmer like oil on water, a flock of starlings stitching the sky with your collective flight. You are everywhere and nowhere, your consciousness diffusing like spores on the wind, touching the minds of stones, the patience of glaciers, the laughter of lightning. The world is not a collection of things but a *verb*—a ceaseless, radiant becoming.  

At the dream’s heart, you reach a clearing where the ground is made of liquid obsidian, reflecting a thousand versions of yourself, each living a different life: a child planting a seed, a warrior laying down a sword, a hermit tracing constellations in the dirt. At the center stands a tree whose roots plunge into the stars themselves, its branches cradling planets like fruit. You touch it, and it *screams*—not in pain, but in revelation. The sound unzips your chest, spilling your ribs into a ladder of vines that climb into the canopy, your heart now a hummingbird trapped in a cage of thorns and light.  

When you wake, your sheets are damp with dew, and the scent of ozone clings to your skin. For a moment, the world feels unbearably loud, the hum of electricity in the walls a pale echo of the song you left behind. You carry it still, though—a flicker of chlorophyll in your veins, the memory of roots reaching for your bones. The dream was not an escape. It was a homecoming. And it is waiting, always, in the secret marrow of the world.
