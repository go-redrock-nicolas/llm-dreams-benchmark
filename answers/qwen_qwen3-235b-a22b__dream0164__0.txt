I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, but it’s not heat—it’s possibility. You stand in a forest where the trees are made of glassine bark, their branches refracting starlight into prismatic shards that rain down in slow motion. Beneath your bare feet, the ground pulses faintly, as though the earth itself is breathing. You don’t question it. In dreams, logic is a rumor told by the waking.  

You hold out your hand. A pebble rests in your palm, gray and unremarkable. But when you focus, really *focus*, you feel it—a hum in your molars, a flicker behind your eyes. The pebble grows warm, then cold, then alive. Its texture shifts: first to the slick smoothness of mercury, then the fibrous grit of wood, then the crystalline hum of diamond. You laugh, a sound that echoes like wind chimes, and the pebble explodes into a swarm of fireflies made of liquid gold. They spiral upward, dissolving the glass trees into mist.  

*What else can you do?*  

A river cuts through the dream-landscape, its water glowing turquoise. You dip your fingers in. The liquid freezes instantly, not into ice, but into a lattice of sapphire threads that harden into a bridge. You walk across it, and with each step, the bridge becomes something new: first obsidian, then living ivy, then a cascade of rubies that shatter and reform beneath your feet. The river below roars, not with water, but with molten copper, and you wonder if you’ve made it so—or if the dream always held this secret.  

You reach the other side and pluck a feather from a passing bird that’s half-owl, half-candle flame. It hisses in your grip, transforming into a quill of smoldering ash. You scratch the air with it, and the sky rips open like parchment, revealing a second moon—a hollow sphere of frosted silver. You throw the quill into a puddle of shadow, and it emerges as a tree, its trunk jet-black, its leaves razor-thin slivers of amethyst. The tree grows upward until its branches pierce clouds that bleed ink.  

But then, a tremor. The ground cracks, and you realize you’ve been careless. Transmutation is a language, and you’ve been shouting. The earth here is unstable, a soup of half-formed elements: pools of quicksilver bubble into chlorine gas, rocks fold into origami scorpions that skitter away. A fissure yawns open, revealing a core of liquid obsidian. You stumble back, heart racing, as the dream begins to unravel.  

You kneel, pressing your palms to the quaking ground. *Undo it. Undo it.* You think of stillness—a winter lake, a sheet of untouched marble—and feel the chaos slow. The obsidian solidifies. The scorpions crumble into sand. The second moon winks out. But the power leaves a residue: your hands glow faintly, as though lit from within by molten glass.  

When you wake, the remnants linger. The pillowcase smells of ozone. Your fingertips are stained faintly green, like copper rubbed raw. And for a heartbeat, you swear you can hear the hum of the dream’s river in your bones—a song of endless becoming.
