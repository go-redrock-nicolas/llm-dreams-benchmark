I am dreaming. It begins with a trigger, something meant to instigate an impulsive reaction.. I feel the urgency and the bubbling emotions that prompt me to respond. But before I allow these feelings to overpower me, I find an unexpected pause, a serene moment amidst the chaos.

In this fleeting moment, the dream transitions. The surroundings warp into a scene of cosmic beauty; imagine a midnight sky adorned with twinkling stars so bright they cast a silvery glow across the landscape. The ground beneath my feet shifts from a solid surface to a calm, crystal-clear lake, reflecting the night sky in its stillness.

The air is filled with a soft, gentle breeze, carrying a symphony of celestial sounds that seem to hum in unison with the rhythm of the universe. Fireflies emerge from all directions, their light flickering in sync with the pulsating rhythm of my heart, creating an enchanting display around me.

I look down at myself in the reflection of the lake and watch as my form undergoes a metamorphosis. My body is enveloped by a warm light, which grows brighter until I am no longer visible, replaced by a radiant silhouette. I have transcended my physical form, evolving into a being of pure energy.

With my newly acquired control over my energy-self, I levitate above the lake. The ripples sway, reflecting a myriad of colors from the cosmic light. In all directions, I see planets, galaxies, and cosmic phenomena, each more captivating than the last. The entire universe is within my reach.

Then, in a twinkling of an eye, the universe folds into itself, bringing me to the birthplace of cosmos - the primordial soup brimming with particles of light. The sight is spellbinding; I bear witness to the formation of the universe, the birth of stars, the creation life itself. I am humbled, my impulsive reaction now feels insignificant against the grandeur of the cosmos.

The space around me echoes a whisper, "You are a part of this enormity, just as it is a part of you." The profoundness of these words resounds within me, aligning my energy-self with the universe.

As the dream lingers, my interaction with the universe remains suspended in a dance of energy and color. I understand that my pause, my moment of restraint, allowed me to envisage this magnificence. The triggering situation fades into oblivion, and as I am filled with celestial wisdom, I am free to harness this serene pause whenever faced with the chaos of the world.

This is the dream, a manifestation of the deepest parts of imagination.
