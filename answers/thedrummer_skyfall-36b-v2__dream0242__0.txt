I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the heart of a sprawling nuclear facility, its cavernous interior sprawling out before me in a dizzying array of pipes, tubes, and maintenance ladders stretching high into the shadows. The air is heavy and humid, thick with the stench of ozone and scorched metal. Alarm klaxons wail a discordant symphony, their piercing drones echoing off the cold concrete walls.

In the ominous green glow of the control console before me, readouts flash an epidemic of failures across cascading systems. Safety protocols flicker and fail one after another, overloaded and non-responsive, flickering out like dying stars. On the massive main screen, the reactor core glows a furious cherry red, molten fuel rods writhing and churning in a chaotic, uncontrolled frenzy.

I slam my fist against the emergency shutdown button, but the system doesn't respond with its usual mechanical hiss and sigh. Instead, I'm greeted by an ominous array of error messages, workflows imploding and recalibration sequences aborting. With each failure, the reactor vessels groan and creak, conduits rupturing in geysers of superheated steam.

The containment building begins to shudder violently around me, ceiling panels raining down in a hail of sparks and crumbling masonry. With growing desperation, I feverishly scan for an escape, seeing only receding options as more of the complex lurches into collapse. 

But just as the devastation seems certain, impossible and hope sparks within me. In the burning edge of my vision, a figure takes shape - an ethereal, luminous woman with hair of woven starlight and eyes that shimmer like distant galaxies. She reaches out with a delicate hand that seems to ignite with soft, inviting light…

I reach for her, my fingers elongating as my body stretches ever towards her warmth. And then, with a jolt, the dream begins to crumble around me like grains of sand…

I'm awake.
