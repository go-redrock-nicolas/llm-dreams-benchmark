I am dreaming. I'm gripping the yoke of a gleaming silver aircraft, suspended in the vast expanse between heaven and earth. The sky unfurls around me in watercolor strokes of cerulean and pearl, wisps of clouds parting like gossamer curtains as we slice through the atmosphere. The cockpit hums with the reassuring percussion of properly functioning systems—the rhythmic beep of navigation equipment, the gentle vibration of the engines, the soft murmur of air circulation.

Then, without warning, the harmony shatters.

The control panel erupts in a constellation of angry red lights. The altimeter needle begins to tremble. The reassuring electronic voice of the autopilot goes silent, replaced by the shrill, insistent wailing of multiple alarms. The aircraft shudders beneath my hands like a living thing in distress.

Behind me, separated by a thin door, sit two hundred souls who boarded with complete faith in my ability to deliver them safely to their destination. I can almost feel the weight of their trust pressing against my shoulders.

Time warps strangely—expanding and contracting. Each second stretches into painful clarity while simultaneously racing away from me. My co-pilot's voice sounds distant, underwater, as she rapidly cycles through emergency protocols. My hands move with a surreal disconnection, muscle memory taking over where conscious thought falters.

The horizon begins to tilt as we lose hydraulic pressure. The clouds that moments ago floated peacefully below us now swirl around the windows, disorienting and thick. Through breaks in the vapor, I glimpse the earth's surface—a patchwork mosaic of fields and forests growing inexorably larger.

Strange, how my mind catalogs inconsequential details: the coffee stain on my flight manual, the family photo taped to my co-pilot's side of the cockpit, the peculiar pattern of condensation forming on the inner glass of the windshield.

As I wrestle with unresponsive controls, something unexpected blooms within me—not panic, but a profound, crystalline clarity. Time slows further. My breathing steadies. My hands cease their trembling.

With startling lucidity, I realize I know exactly what to do...
