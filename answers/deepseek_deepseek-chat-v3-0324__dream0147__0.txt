I am dreaming. The sky above me is a swirling tapestry of twilight violets and molten gold, streaked with clouds that twist like serpents made of smoke. I stand in a long hallway, its walls lined with flickering mirrors, each reflecting pieces of my life—except they’re wrong. The images shift and warp before my eyes, revealing moments I thought I knew, now altered.  

Then, I see *them*—the person whose smile once anchored me, whose words I trusted like scripture. But in the mirrors, the truth unravels: their lips move, but their whispers are not to me, their laughter is edged with secrecy, their touch is laced with performance. Every glance, every promise, every quiet midnight confession—reconfigured into something cold, deliberate.  

My breath should catch. My hands should tremble. But instead, a strange calm settles over me, like frost crystallizing on a still lake. I step closer to the nearest mirror, watching the reflections peel back, showing a script I never knew I was acting in. I am not the protagonist. I am the audience.  

And then, the floor gives way.  

I fall—not into darkness, but into an ocean of liquid silver. The waters are thick, swirling with forgotten conversations, half-smiles that never reached their eyes, letters written in ink that vanishes as soon as it dries. I drift deeper, weightless, watching the last traces of what I believed dissolve like sugar in the tide.  

When I wake, the dream clings to me, not as a wound, but as a revelation—cold, glittering, and strangely beautiful. The deception wasn’t a betrayal. It was an invitation. To see clearly. To rewrite the story.  

And for the first time, I am free.
