I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric tension, thick with the scent of ozone and something older, something wild—like wet earth after a storm, like lightning given form. The sky is a quilt of shifting colors: violet bleeding into molten gold, shot through with veins of cerulean. Stars pulse like living things, winking in and out as though whispering secrets to one another. Beneath my feet, the ground is not solid but a mosaic of shifting glass tiles, each one reflecting fractured glimpses of other worlds—a desert of black sand here, a city suspended in the clouds there, a crimson ocean with tides that move in reverse.  

I had thought I had won. The door—the obsidian archway veined with silver light—had finally cracked open after years (or was it seconds?) of unraveling its riddles. I had stepped through, expecting revelation, triumph. But the other side is not an ending.  

It is an amphitheater carved from a single, towering crystal, stretching endlessly upward into the abyss of the sky. At its center, a mirror floats, its surface not reflecting but *absorbing*, pulling in the light, the color, the very breath from my lungs. And in front of it, *me*. Or a version of me—but wrong. This other self moves like liquid shadow, eyes two pits of infinite depth, lips curved in a smile that cuts deeper than any knife.  

"One last test," the shadow murmurs, its voice the echo of every fear I've ever swallowed.  

And I realize: This is not about unlocking a door. It's about facing what was locked inside me all along. The mirror quivers, stretches—beckoning. To step into it is to dissolve, to become, to unbecome.  

The dream holds its breath. I step forward.  

What happens next is everything.
