I am dreaming. You discover that you can fly through space unimpeded, leaving trails of light behind you like a comet. You feel weightlessness and freedom as you explore distant galaxies and nebulae. It is exhilarating! 

Then, suddenly, you encounter an immovable barrier blocking your path. It's made up of some unknown substance that seems to resist all forms of manipulation or destruction. You try everything but nothing works. You feel trapped and frustrated. 

That's when you remember the advice from the mysterious voice at the beginning of this dream. You realize that if you want to overcome obstacles, find allies who share common goals. Perhaps there is someone out there who can help you break through this barrier. 

You decide to search for potential allies by projecting yourself into other dreamers' subconscious minds. You hope to find like-minded individuals with whom you could form a powerful alliance and achieve great things together. Maybe even defeat the shadowy enemy that controls the barrier. 

But first, you must leave this dream behind...
