I am dreaming. Dreaming of a world that seems so real, so vivid, so alive. I find myself standing inside a grand, ancientWonder of the world, a majestic structure that has withstood the test of time. The Architecture is breathtaking, with intricate mosaic floors and stained glass windows that filter through the faint light, casting kaleidoscopic colors on the walls.

I am surrounded by fellow survivors, people from all walks of life, all with their own stories and fears. We are in what appears to be some sort of grand library or amphitheater, the walls lined with ancient tomes and mysterious artifacts. The whispers and murmurs of the crowd are hushed, a constant hum of anxiety and worry.

And then, without warning, the ground begins to shudder beneath our feet. The earth trembles, the very foundations of the building start to falter, and a deafening roar echoes through the air. The walls crack and crumble, showers of dust and debris raining down on us like a deadly snowstorm.

The survivors around me cry out, some screaming for help, others praying fervently. I feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins, my heart pounding in my chest like a runaway drum.

Blinding dust and debris obscure my vision, making it hard to breathe, to see, to think. The air is thick with the acrid smell of dust and burnt stone, choking the life out of me. Hands grab at my clothing, clinging tightly as if refusing to let go. Together, we stumble and fall, our cries and moans echoing off the walls.

The choking dust clouds my vision, forcing me to blindly feel my way around shattered stone and tangled debris. My lungs are burning, my chest heaving with effort. Every fibre of my being screams to run, to flee, to escape this suffocating nightmare.

Through the murmurs of despair and wails of fear, I hear whispers, eerie whispers that seem to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The whispers urge me on, nudging me forward, through the rubble, through the caret!

But fear grips me, a river of ice flowing through my veins, clutching my heart and threatening to extinguish the flame within me. Even so, I push forward, driven by a stubborn spark of defiance. Together with the others, we push on, digging through the rubble, comporting towards the darkness...
