I am dreaming. One day, you happen to catch sight of this person across a crowded room. Your heart flutters as their eyes meet yours. You feel a rush of excitement and nervousness. You make your way over to them, feeling their gaze burning a hole in the back of your neck.

As you approach, they seem surprised but also happy to see you. They smile warmly and offer their hand in greeting. You take it, feeling electricity course through your veins, and as you hold onto their hand, it feels like they're holding onto you too.

Then, out of nowhere, they become distant again. They seem to forget about you or lose interest. You're left confused and hurt, wondering what went wrong. You try to talk to them, to get closer, but they rebuff your attempts, making excuses to pull away.

Despite the hurt, you can't shake your feelings for them. So, you decide to give them space but not give up on the possibility of something more. You focus on yourself and your own happiness, immersing yourself in hobbies and activities that bring you joy.

In your dream, you find yourself standing alone by the water's edge at sunset. The sky is painted with shades of orange, pink, and purple. As you watch the waves crash against the shore, you feel a calm wash over you. In this moment, you realize that you are enough for yourself. You don't need anyone else to complete you.

Just then, you feel a presence behind you. You turn around to see the person you've been dreaming about. They're standing there, looking sheepish. "I don't know why I push you away," they admit. "You're amazing, and I want to be with you." 

Without hesitation, you take their hand. This time, you know that their feelings are genuine. You smile, feeling a sense of peace and contentment wash over you. Together, you walk into the sunset, ready for whatever adventures lie ahead.
