I am dreaming. The scene unfolds in a somber, dimly lit library filled with ancient, leather-bound books. Rows of shelves stretch endlessly into the misty distance, their spines glowing faintly under the soft, golden light from hidden lanterns. I am sitting at a massive oak desk, the surface scarred with faint etchings of forgotten runes. In front of me lies a half-written manuscript, the ink still wet, though the words blur as I try to read them.

A sudden chill pierces the air, and I shiver, looking around to find the source of the sudden cold. The library seems to have grown more cavernous, its corners now shrouded in complete darkness. From the far end of the room, a shadow moves, a vague outline of a figure draped in an ancient, tattered robe. I cannot see their face, only the outline of their form, but there is an undeniable presence about them, one that fills me with both dread and curiosity.

The figure moves closer, the light in the lanterns flickering in reaction to their presence. I feel a sudden tightness in my chest, the air growing thin as if the room is shrinking. The books around me hum with ancient energy, their pages fluttering as though caught in an invisible wind. The air feels thick with the weight of centuries, a sense of foreboding pressing down on me.

Suddenly, the figure stops directly in front of me. Despite their face remaining hidden in shadow, I can feel their gaze penetrating me, as though they are peeling back the layers of my soul. I can’t move, frozen in place as they extend a withered hand, their long, gnarled fingers curled slightly, as if clutching some intangible object.

They speak, but their voice is not human. It echoes like the tolling of a distant bell, hollow and heavy. "You are not alone in this world," the figure intones. "Your secrets, your desires, your fears… they are mine to hold."

A cold, heavy weight settles in my stomach. I want to scream, to run, but I am rooted to the spot. The figure reaches out again, their hand brushing my forehead. A searing pain erupts between my eyes, like a thousand tiny needles piercing my skin. I scream, my voice reverberating off the walls of the library, but no one responds.

Then, the pain melts away, and I am floating. The library disappears, replaced by an endless expanse of stars racing past me. I feel weightless, drifting through space, the starlight dancing in my mind. A sense of freedom washes over me, though it is tinged with the faintest undercurrent of terror.

Suddenly, I am back in the library. The figure is gone, but the books are no longer bound. Instead, they flutter like birds, their pages glowing faintly as if alive. I move to grab one, but as soon as I touch a page, the ink under my fingers starts to shift, reforming into new words, a message clear as day: "You are not defined by what you take, but by what you choose to give."

I wake up, sitting bolt upright in bed, the remnants of the dream clinging to me like a second skin. My heart pounds in my chest, my breathing shallow. The dream lingers, its images and words indelibly imprinted on my mind. I feel unsettled, questioning what the dream means, what it says about me. Yet, one thought stays with me: the figure’s message.

I resolve to listen, to reflect on the meaning behind the dream. It feels not just like a warning, but like a promise.
