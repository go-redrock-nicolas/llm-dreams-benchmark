I am dreaming. As the dream takes hold, I find myself standing upon a windswept cliff, the salty spray from the churning sea far below mingling with the misty air. The sky is a maelstrom of colors - deep purples, vibrant oranges, and electric blues swirl together in a mesmerizing dance. The wind howls around me, its mournful cries echoing through the lonely landscape like the lamentations of forgotten souls.

I feel a surge of adrenaline coursing through my veins, my pulse quickening in time with the frenetic motion of the clouds. My skin tingles, not from the chill of the wind, but from a growing sense of excitement, of anticipation. My muscles tense, as if ready to spring into action at a moment's notice.

As I gaze out at the turbulent sea, I begin to notice a change. The waves, once crashing against the base of the cliff, begin to recede. The water pulls back further and further, as if in preparation for the arrival of a great tidal wave. The exposed sea bed reveals strange, glowing coral formations and glittering pools of crystal clear water.

Suddenly, I feel a jolt of fear as I hear footsteps approaching from behind. I spin around to face this unknown presence, and what I see sends a shiver down my spine. It is a woman, her skin deathly pale, her eyes a piercing green. She is gaunt and skeletal, her long hair blowing behind her in the wind.

She speaks in a voice that is barely audible over the howling wind. "Come with me," she says, her bony hand reaching out to grasp my arm. I feel a sense of repulsion, but also an inexplicable pull towards her. I am drawn to her, even as my mind screams for me to resist.

As she leads me away from the cliff, I notice that the world around us is changing. The sky clouds over and a thick fog rolls in, obscuring everything. I stumble behind her, my hands outstretched in front of me, trying to feel my way through the dense mist.

We come to a clearing, and there I see a glowing light. It is a mirror, its surface calm and unbroken. The woman pushes me forward, and I see that I am standing right at the edge of the mirror.

Looking back, I see that she has vanished into the fog, and I am left alone. I turn back to the mirror, and as I gaze into its depths, I see a vision of a world far different from the one I left behind. In this world, I am free to live as I choose, unbound by the limitations and expectations of those around me.

But, I realize, the cost is higher than I ever could have imagined. I am not the only one gazing into the mirror; I am joined by the spirits of all who have gone before me, all who were drawn in by the siren's song of the mirror's power.

As I stand there, torn between the desire for freedom and the horror of the mirror's dark history, the dream begins to fade. Or is it just a trick, a prologue to a deeper level of dreaming?

The sensation of my fingers, pressed against the freezing glass, the pressure of an unseen force, alive, ancient, drawing me in. The last visions still float before my eyes as the ritual of dreaming, undulates and withers. and slips through the phantom fingers of night. I am left alone, surrounded by the swirling mists of memory.
