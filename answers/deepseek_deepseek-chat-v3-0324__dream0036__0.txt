I am dreaming. The vessel hums beneath me, a living thing of polished obsidian and liquid chrome, its surface shifting like the skin of some celestial serpent. They call it the *Event Horizon Diver*, a ship built to breach the impossible—to pierce the boundary of a rogue black hole drifting at the edge of known space. The scientists whisper that it should have evaporated millennia ago, and yet it pulses like a sleeping god, warping the fabric of reality around it.  

The airlock seals behind me with a hiss that sounds like a held breath. The control panel flickers to life, spectral blue symbols dancing in the zero gravity, responding to the electrical signals of my thoughts. My reflection in the curved glass shows a face I barely recognize—eyes alight with something beyond fear, beyond excitement. A hunger.  

The countdown begins. *Ten.* The stars outside ripple, as though seen through molten glass.  
*Nine.* The black hole exhales—a soundless breath that shudders through the ship.  
*Eight.* From the abyss, something flickers—not a star, not a reflection. A glint of recognition.  
*Seven.* The mission parameters dissolve in my mind. This was never about science. It was always an invitation.  
*Six.* The radio crackles with voices—not from Mission Control, but from *inside* the anomaly. Whispers in a language my bones understand.  
*Five.* My heartbeat syncs with the pulsing dark.  
*Four.* The ship shudders, alive, eager.  
*Three.* The edges of reality blur.  
*Two.* I realize—they didn’t choose me because I could survive. They chose me because I would *change.*  
*One.*  

The universe folds. And then—  

Silence.  

And then—  

A hand, impossibly vast, reaches from the dark.  

Not to crush.  

To *pull me in.*
