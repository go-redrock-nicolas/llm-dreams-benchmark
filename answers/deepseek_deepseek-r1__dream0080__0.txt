I am dreaming. <placeholderno487>

The nightmare began with whispers. Not the soft, feather-light kind that tickle your ear in a sunlit meadow, but jagged, serrated syllables that scraped against the walls of your skull. You stood in a cathedral of glass, its spires piercing a sky the color of tarnished silver. The structure was your life’s work—a labyrinth of mirrors and prisms designed to fracture light into colors no human eye had ever seen. A symphony of rainbows. A monument to possibility.

But now the glass was bleeding. Thick, iridescent droplets oozed from the seams, pooling at your feet like molten gemstones. Each drop carried a reflection: the late nights hunched over blueprints, the blistered hands from shaping molten silica, the decades spent convincing skeptics that light could hold secrets darker than shadow. You reached to catch a falling bead of violet-tinged crimson, but it sizzled through your palm, leaving a star-shaped scar. The cathedral groaned like a living thing as fractures spiderwebbed across its surface. Somewhere in the maze of breaking glass, a clock began striking thirteen.

When the collapse came, it didn’t roar—it *sang*. A haunting chromatic scale rising through shattered octaves as the spire folded inward, swallowing its own reflections. You tried to run, but the liquid glass had hardened around your ankles, rooting you in place as the world dissolved into a kaleidoscope of wrathful light. The final shard struck like a diamond bullet between your eyes, and you...

...woke. Or rather, *transitioned*. 

Now you float in a dimensionless void where gravity is a forgotten rumor. The ruins of your cathedral hang suspended around you, each fragment humming with residual energy. A prism the size of a continent drifts by, still projecting fractured light onto the nothingness. In its glow, you see them—the ghosts of every abandoned iteration. A younger you adjusting the angle of a mirror cluster. An older you weeping over a collapsed prototype. A version of you that never existed, smiling beside a completed structure that warps sunlight into liquid music.

One shard catches your attention. Peer closer. Through its distorted lens, the ruins rearrange themselves. The glass isn’t broken—it’s *breathing*, each piece undulating like cells in some vast inorganic lung. The scar on your palm pulses in sync. When the debris begins swirling toward a new focal point, you realize with electric dread: this isn’t the end. 

It’s mitosis.

The cathedral is rebuilding itself inside out, geometries folding into impossible origami. Violet light congeals into stairs that spiral downward into upward. A bridge of frozen flame arcs toward a black star that sucks at the surrounding void. Your body unwinds like skeins of thread, fibers stretching toward the rebirth happening light-years per second away. There’s no difference now between architect and architecture. You are the blueprint. The collapse. The recombinant dream. 

Somewhere in the maelstrom, a single pure tone resonates—the same note you heard when the first shard pierced your skull. It tastes like a question. 

What do you build when failure becomes your foundation?
