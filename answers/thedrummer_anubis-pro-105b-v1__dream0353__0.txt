I am dreaming. The Dreamer 
As I float through the fragrant bazaars of Marrakech, the scents of saffron and cardamom gently wafting through the air, I stumble upon a small tucked-away shop promising spiritual discovery.
The sign above the door reads, "Discover the Harmony of the Spheres."

Curiosity getting the better of me, I push open the door, and step inside, surprised at how familiar the surroundings feel.
The shop is dimly lit, but sparkling with glittering gemstones and shimmering silks.
An elderly man approaches me, his eyes tranquil, his smile kind.

"Welcome, my daughter," he says. "I have been expecting you. You are here to learn about the ancient practice of sacred geometry, yes?"

As I nod in agreement, he leads me deeper down a winding corridor of sensory delights - fragrance, color, music and sound - until we reach a quiet inner courtyard filled with roses and a single hummingbird.

There, beneath the stars, he begins my initiation into the mystical world of platonic solids, Fibonacci sequences, and the hidden language of the universe.
As knowledge flows into me about how sacred geometry underlies all of existence - the intricate structures of living things and the very fabric of space time - I feel a deep resonance within me, as if I have always known this truth, but had simply forgotten.
The world is filled with wonder and magic.
I am connected to everything, a part of the grand tapestry.
In this moment, all is right with the universe.
I am home.

I am the dreamer, exploring the infinite possibilities of my own consciousness, a universe unto myself. And for now, all dreams delight.
