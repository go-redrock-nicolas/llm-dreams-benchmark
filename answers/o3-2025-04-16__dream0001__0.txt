I am dreaming. …start to move, at first with that sludgy, slow-motion feeling common to dreams, then—almost without noticing—at a hummingbird’s velocity. The street beneath your shoes morphs between cracked cobblestones and shimmering glass tiles, reflecting an impossible kaleidoscope of skies: dawn on one side, dusk on the other, and a pulsing nebula right down the middle.

Above you tower buildings that look as if they were designed by architects who misread gravity as a polite suggestion. Some structures hover at a leisurely tilt, anchored by thick ropes of ivy; others spiral upward like giant porcelain seashells, windows rotating to follow you like benevolent eyes. Each façade is plastered with unfathomable signage: brass glyphs that curl into themselves, neon punctuation marks the size of doors, glowing ink that drips upward instead of down.

A clock somewhere, nowhere, tolls once—deep and resonant, like a gong struck inside your ribs. One hour left.

Panic flickers, but curiosity blazes brighter. Instinct tells you to hunt for a landmark, yet the road immediately forks into seven separate avenues, each labeled only by color: Cerulean Way, Vermilion Causeway, Viridian Boulevard, and four more hues your waking mind has never seen and cannot name. A cat—no, a fox—no, a creature made of shifting origami folds—purrs past your ankle and knocks free a newspaper stand. The papers flutter upward like startled birds, flutter, then settle. On every front page, a different headline:

YOUR MEETING IS EVERYWHERE AT ONCE.  
LOCATION: WHERE YOU FIND IT.  
TIME: FELT, NOT TOLD.

You grab a page. The ink rearranges itself under your gaze, forming a spidery map. Tiny lanterns ignite along an indicated path, stringing themselves into the air like fireflies on an invisible leash, beckoning you forward.

You follow.

The lanterns lead you through a bazaar tucked beneath an aqueduct of flowing starlight. Merchants hawk memories in glass bottles, thunderclap seeds, ladders of braided moon-silk. A merchant with mirrors for eyes notices your urgency and offers you a compass that points not north, but toward “the next right decision.” The needle spins, then locks onto a spiral staircase that wasn’t there a moment ago.

Up you climb, each step a different texture—velvet, sand, polished wood, watermelon rind—until you burst onto a rooftop garden. Here, roses bloom in mid-air, petals orbiting invisible stems; koi swim through ripples of sunlight instead of water. At the center stands a doorframe with no walls, freestanding like a ticket booth for infinity. An embossed brass plate reads:

APPOINTMENTS
ENTER WITH INTENTION

You step through.

Instantly you’re in a glass elevator ascending the outside of a cathedral-turned-skyscraper. Gargoyles animate, offering polite nods as you pass. Far below, the city rearranges itself like tiles in a sliding puzzle, preparing for something monumental: your arrival, perhaps. Clouds slip by, close enough to touch; you trail a finger through one and taste citrus.

A gentle chime: “Top floor: Chrono-Parlor.”

The doors sigh open onto a lounge of velvet constellations. Clocks of every imaginable shape float free of the walls, ticking not with gears but with heartbeats. At the room’s center sits a single chair crafted from woven filaments of dawn and dusk, and in that chair—well, that chair is empty. It’s meant for you.

The clocks stop simultaneously. Silence blooms, immense and velvety. You realize: the meeting is not with another person at all. It is with this moment. With the still point inside the whirl.

You sit.

Time exhales, collapsing into something softer than sleep. The city’s roar dwindles to the murmur of a distant tide. In the hush, you feel knowledge unfurl: the purpose of the meeting was to remind you that even when lost, you generate your own North; even when late, you carry the appointment within you.

The vast dream city dims to a chiaroscuro glow. Buildings bow in gentle farewell. Lanterns wink out one by one.

A final thought hangs in the air like sweet smoke: Wherever you are, you’ve arrived.

And just as the dreamscape dissolves into a watercolor wash, you wake—heart steady, mind humming—still tasting the faint echo of citrus clouds on your tongue.
