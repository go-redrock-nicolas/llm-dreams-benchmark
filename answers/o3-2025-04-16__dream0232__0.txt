I am dreaming. …I take a long, slow breath and feel it echo through the dreamworld like the toll of a crystal bell. The air shimmers, threads of color wavering in and out of focus—lapis blues, phantom purples, sparks of molten silver. The ground beneath my bare feet is not earth or stone but a mosaic of memories: tiny, shifting tiles that form and dissolve like reflections on rippling water.

The belief—my cherished pillar—materializes beside me as a towering glass obelisk. Its surface is etched with every experience that once justified it: childhood smiles, heartfelt conversations, triumphant moments when the belief seemed to propel me forward. I see them all, like insects fossilized in amber. But now a thin crack snakes down its center, glowing with a harsh, unnatural red. I reach out. The glass is cold, yet it hums with false vitality, like neon tubing buzzing on its last surge of electricity.

A single touch, and the obelisk shivers apart. Fragments hang in the air, suspended, each shard displaying the doctored data, the doctored photographs, the doctored smiles that had fed the illusion. I should feel betrayed—my pulse should spike, my knees should buckle—but something inside me clicks open instead. There is a sudden spaciousness, as if my ribs have unfolded into wings.

I turn slowly. All around me the dreamworld tilts, no longer a static landscape but a scroll that unrolls beneath a new wind. in the sky, constellations rearrange themselves into fresh symbols. Orion melts into a spiral, the Pleiades fuse into a single vast candle, and they whisper possibilities without judgment. 

From the cracks in the sky pours a river of liquid ink—it churns, midnight-dark, but speckled with starlight. I step into it, expecting cold, yet it hugs my ankles like warm velvet. I wade deeper until the ink reaches my chest, and I feel a startling buoyancy—this “darkness” holds me aloft. My false belief, like glass dust, drifts on the surface, then dissolves. No bitterness. Just release.

A flickering figure approaches along the river. It’s me, but composed of shifting calligraphy—sentences and punctuation weaving into a silhouette. This Ink-Self hands me a fresh page, blank except for a single breath-mark at the top, like a tiny bird poised to fly. “Rewrite,” the figure says, voice echoing with the hush of libraries and the hush after thunder. “But write with living words, not museum pieces. Let every sentence be willing to change.”

I nod, and the page warms in my palm. The ink river solidifies into a path of obsidian glass, leading to a horizon where dawn is perpetually blooming. Peach-gold light stretches its fingers across the dunes of possibility. On either side sprout towering flowers of fluorescent cyan, their petals glassy and translucent, inside each one a different version of me laughs, dances, learns a new truth. None of them are ashamed; they evolve like fractals, infinitely branching.

I start forward. With every step, new lines appear on the page, written in luminous ink that seems to grow straight out of my pulse. I don’t ponder each sentence; I feel them shape themselves: “Curiosity is my compass.” “Contradictions are invitations.” “Certainty is a door I can always open, close, or walk around.” The old belief recedes like a distant island swallowed by morning mist. No hostility, just peaceful obsolescence.

In the clearing ahead stands a colossal heart-shaped doorway carved from living amethyst, beating softly. I press my new page against its surface. The doorway reads my words, glows brighter, then swings wide. A gust of air smelling like first rain merges with the scent of books just printed. I step through.

On the far side is an infinite atrium—high domes of stained-glass potential overhead, floors of liquid mirror underfoot. Every person I’ve ever admired stands there, but their faces are open books—literally pages fluttering—inviting me to read, revise, or add to their stories. I realize they, too, have shed beliefs like seasonal coats, and they greet me not as a fallen believer but as a fellow explorer.

I feel neither the sting of betrayal nor the ache of loss. Instead, a gentle, buzzing elation thrums in my bones. A choir of cricket-like violins plays somewhere between the ribs of the dream. I raise my page high, and the blank spaces shine brighter than the text, beckoning me to keep carving tunnels into the unknown.

Then, in the distance, I hear a hush—a signal that the dream’s borders are thinning. A golden feather floats down, landing on my page. I sign my name in its leftover spark, sealing the first chapter of a belief born from fluid, honest light.

And as I wake, I carry with me not shattered glass but living ink and an ever-expandable page—ready to keep writing under the changing constellations of the day.
