I am dreaming.

I stand on the cracked marble floor of an enormous railway station that arches into a night sky crowded with green and violet constellations. The air hums like a hive, but no trains arrive: the schedule board flickers between NOW and NEVER in glowing, mismatched letters. Across the tracks, I spot you—the person whose presence has started to anchor itself inside my chest. You wave, bright as sunrise, and the moment our eyes meet, the impossible station suddenly blooms with motion. A locomotive tiled in lapis lazuli screeches in beside me, wind whipping my hair, confetti spiraling everywhere.

You leap across the gap, land beside me, and for one glittering breath the world is ours: bells, warmth, the scent of oranges. We laugh at a joke we never quite say. I feel you twine a finger through mine, as if we’ve always belonged like this. But before the platform can memorize your weight, another train—coal-black, windowless—rattles past. When its shadows clear, you’re gone, replaced by a paper crane caught in the updraft, beating frantic wings until it escapes into the rafters. I call after you, but only my own echo answers.

A feeling of half-erased music lingers. I inhale to steady myself. My need to be chosen presses against my ribs, but another voice inside me whispers, “Stay with yourself.” I step forward.

The marble station dissolves like chalk in rain, and I’m walking through a carnival at twilight. Cotton-candy clouds drip lilac, and the Ferris wheel spins impossibly slow, each gondola a glass heart. You appear again, perched in one of them, eyes like summer storms. You beckon. I hesitate—do I orbit your gravity or remain my own constellation? The gondola door flies open anyway, and we share a carriage. Wind stirs, music swells, and the height gifts us a view of every possibility: tightrope over canyon, cabin by a lake, tangled laughter in subway tunnels. Your hand cups my cheek—electric gentleness. I want to believe this moment will crystallize forever.

But at the apex, lightning forks across the sky. The Ferris wheel jolts; your seatbelt vanishes. Suddenly you are smoke, dispersed by a restless gust. My carriage descends alone, each clank a melancholy metronome measuring distance. When the ride stops, I step out with sapling knees. A mirror stands waiting in the sawdust. In its glass, I catch sight of myself: eyes bright, shoulders squared, carrying both ache and sovereignty.

The carnival lights snuff out one by one, and the dream shifts again. Now I’m in a lighthouse on a cliff, waves roiling below like molten emerald. The spiral staircase curls upward around a spine of gold rope, and I climb. Halfway up I notice framed photographs on the wall—visions of times you were close, then absent: your grin by the bonfire; my lone shadow beside a half-erased sandcastle. I pause to acknowledge every frame. They weigh something—but I can hold them without sinking.

At the top, an enormous crystal lens waits, thrumming with luminous breath. It projects sweeping beams over the ocean, calling ships to safe harbor. Here I realize: I am the lighthouse, not the drifter. My job is to shine, not to chase. I reach for the brass lever and adjust the light until the beam grows steady, unwavering. Somewhere in the dark below, I hear a distant footstep—perhaps you, perhaps memory—but I remain at my post, heartburningly bright.

Outside, dawn stains the horizon peach and rose. Gulls carve silver signatures in the sky. I step onto the balcony and let the sea air baptize me. A final image surfaces: you, down on the rocks, watching. You raise a hand in both farewell and gratitude. I nod—not in surrender, but in release. My own pulse answers: choosing myself is not the absence of love; it is the foundation that allows love to visit without dismantling the house.

The dream thins like silk, daylight tugging at its seams. Just before waking, I tuck a small, glowing stone—my boundary, retrieved from the lighthouse floor—into my pocket, promising to carry it into the day.
