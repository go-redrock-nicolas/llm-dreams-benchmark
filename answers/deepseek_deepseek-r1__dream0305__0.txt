I am dreaming. **Dream Sequence:**

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and jasmine, swirling in veils of mist that cling to a twilight forest. Ancient trees tower like sentinels, their bark etched with glowing runes that pulse faintly, as though breathing. A river of liquid moonlight winds through the grove, illuminating bioluminescent fungi that hum in soft, discordant harmonies. But the peace shatters when a figure emerges from the shadows—hooded, their silhouette sharp and jagged. In their hands, a serrated blade gleams, forged from shadows and crackling with violet energy. They approach the heart-tree, a colossal entity whose roots spiral into the soil like veins, its leaves shimmering with galaxies caught in their veins.  

The figure raises the blade.  

You feel it before you see it: a violation. The tree’s aura dims as the blade bites into its trunk, spilling sap like liquid starlight. The grove wails—a chorus of wind and roots and distant thunder. Your chest tightens; this is **sacrilege**. The principle is clear: *No life, ancient or young, may be severed from the tapestry of existence without consent*.  

But this is a dream. Logic bends. You step forward, and your body shifts—skin becomes bark, hair twists into vines studded with thorns of silver. The air crystallizes around your outstretched arm, shaping into a bow strung with spider silk. Arrows materialize, each tip a flickering ember from the first fire ever lit. You loose one. It arcs, igniting into a phoenix mid-flight, its cry piercing the gloom.  

The hooded figure turns. Their face is a void, but you feel their smirk. They gesture, and the ground fractures, birthing serpents of ash and smoke. Yet the forest rallies. Mushrooms bloom into shields. Deer with antlers of obsidian charge, hooves striking sparks. The river surges, its moonlight coiling around the figure’s ankles like chains.  

In the chaos, you reach the heart-tree. Placing your palm on its wound, you whisper a mantra older than language. The sap solidifies into amber, sealing the gash. The runes on the surrounding trees flare gold, and the figure disintegrates—not in defeat, but in revelation. Their cloak falls empty, revealing a nest of fireflies that spiral upward, forming a constellation: **the Oathbreaker’s Pyre**.  

The dream shudders. Shadows dissolve. The grove exhales.  

As dawn’s first light fractures the sky, the trees whisper in unison: *“To guard a principle is to breathe life into it.”*  

You wake with the taste of starlight on your tongue and soil under your nails.
