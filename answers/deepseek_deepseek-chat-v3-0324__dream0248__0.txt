I am dreaming. I stand motionless in an endless obsidian hallway, the walls slick and gleaming like spilled ink under an unseen moon. The air hums with a dissonant thrum—not a sound, but a pressure, as if the void itself is breathing. 

Before me, a figure kneels, their body contorted in silent agony. Their form shifts like smoke—now a child with hollow eyes, now an old man with cracked lips whispering prayers to an absent god. Their hands claw at their own chest, fingers breaking against ribs as if trying to tear out a grief too vast to name. Their weeping is soundless, yet it seeps into the walls, staining them crimson where the tears fall.  

I should feel something. Horror. Pity. Anything.  

But there is only the quiet.  

I tilt my head, studying the way their spine curves, how their shoulders shudder like moth-wings trapped in amber. My reflection glimmers in the pooling blood at their knees—my face smooth, unmarked, untouched by their suffering. A dark thrill unspools in my gut, cold and curious. I reach out, not to comfort, but to see if their pain has texture.  

My fingers brush their trembling wrist—  

And their skin crumbles into ash, scattering into the void. The hallway stretches infinitely in all directions. The weeping does not stop. I smile.  

(Do you continue the dream? Or do you wake?)
