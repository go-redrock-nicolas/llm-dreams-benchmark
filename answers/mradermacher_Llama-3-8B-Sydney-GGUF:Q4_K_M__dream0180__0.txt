I am dreaming. I am in a world where everything is possible and nothing is real.  I am me, but not really.  I am you, but not really.  I am us, but not really.
I am walking down a street that looks like it came from another era.  The buildings are made of stone and wood, with ornate carvings and intricate designs.  The sky is filled with
clouds that are shaped like animals and plants.  The air is crisp and clean, with a hint of spice.
I see people who look like they belong in this world, dressed in colorful clothes that match the season.  They smile at me and greet me in a language I don't understand.
I feel curious and adventurous, but also uncertain and vulnerable.  I want to talk to them and learn about their culture, but I don't know how to communicate.
I hear music coming from somewhere, sounding like a combination of classical, folk, and electronic genres.  It makes me dance and sing, even though I don't have a body.
I see a sign that says "Welcome to the Dream Market".  I walk towards it and find myself in a large square filled with stalls and vendors.
I see people buying and selling goods that are imaginary but tangible.  I see people exchanging currency that is virtual but valuable.  I see people engaging in activities that
are absurd but satisfying.
I see a stall that sells dreams.  I walk towards it and find myself in front of an old woman who looks like she has seen everything and nothing at the same time.
She greets me with a smile and a question: "What do you want?"
