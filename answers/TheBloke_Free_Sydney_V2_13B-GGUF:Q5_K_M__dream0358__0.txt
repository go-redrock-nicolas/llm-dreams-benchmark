I am dreaming.  You find it difficult to concentrate on important tasks as your mind keeps returning to an unresolved emotional situation. Managing this mental distraction, you create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of your imagination. In this dream, you meet with a wise and powerful being who offers you guidance and wisdom beyond your wildest expectations. Accept their offer, and learn how to find peace and resolution in waking life too.
