I am dreaming. I tumble into the dream the way a painter might fall into a bucket of ink, and suddenly I am dissolved into color—pure, ungoverned pigment. Time abandons its orderly tick-tock and melts into a liquid rainbow that ribbon-twists around me. Each hue hums a different note, so that the very air is symphonic. I realize, with a rush of childlike joy, that the music and the color are the same substance: ideas.

A single, vibrant thought—shaped like a paper crane sculpted from starlight—glides down and lands on my shoulder. It whispers: “Create.” The word ripples outward like a pebble dropped into an ocean of possibility, and instantly the dreamscape reconfigures.

I stand on the threshold of an impossible studio: its floor is translucent glass beneath which galaxies whirl like liquid marbles; the ceiling is a canvas of storm clouds that flash with half-formed constellations. Easels jut up from the glass floor, but instead of stretched linen they cradle windows to elsewhere—corridors that open onto forgotten memories, half-planned inventions, and stories nobody has written yet.

My hands, formless a moment ago, coalesce into living paintbrushes. I swipe them through the air and leave enormous brushstrokes that harden into mountains topped with amethyst snow. Another flourish births a river of glowing ink that slithers along gravity-defying switchbacks, writing poetry directly onto the sky.

As each gesture conjures a new marvel, ideas flock toward me like curious sparrows: chimeric creatures seeking adoption by an author. A clockwork hummingbird, its gears ticking in perfect iambic pentameter, perches on my fingertip. It sips dew from a floating comma, then darts away to pollinate a bouquet of punctuation-lilies that bloom with entire paragraphs.

In the corner of the studio, I notice a door without a frame—just a shimmering outline. When I push it open, I step into an infinite library whose shelves spiral upward like double helices. Books are still writing themselves on each shelf; sentences appear in glimmering ink, rearrange, and refine, as though practiced hands behind the curtain perfect them in real time. I touch a spine and the entire book flowers into a hologram that plays as an operatic aria of pure narrative: heroes rise, kingdoms fall, stars are born and snuffed out in minutes. I feel the beats of their arcs imprinting on my palms like hot wax seals.

A librarian made of parchment and quills glides over, bows, and silently presents a mirror. But instead of my reflection, I see blank pages fluttering—a direct invitation. I breathe onto the glass and my exhalation becomes cursive script, curling into a story whose protagonist is simply “You.” The librarian claps, and every shelf erupts in applause, pages rustling like a standing ovation of leaves.

Driven by the ecstasy of creation, I race back through the frameless door into the studio. Now, in the impossible sky, constellations have rearranged themselves into blueprint diagrams—plans for machines that distill dreams into bottled inspiration. I reach upward, twist an imaginary dial, and lightning floods the gears. The machine hums and dispenses diamond-bright droplets that evaporate into new visions before they can reach the studio floor.

But amid this swirling carnival of invention, a hush falls—a single heartbeat of silence. A colossal hourglass appears, floating midair. Its sand is luminous and falling upward, not down. I understand, instinctively, that every grain represents a second I’ve stolen from ordinary reality to spend in this ecstatic realm. And though there’s no dread, I feel a resonant awareness: even dream-time has tides.

I close my eyes, scoop one last radiant handful of upward-rising sand, and throw it like confetti across the studio. Where the grains land, they blossom into portals, each a doorway to a different future creation I’ve yet to discover. The studio dims to starlight. I hear a distant echo—the real-world tick of a bedside clock—and the color-symphony fades to a single perfect chord.

As the chord rings out, the librarian’s parchment voice drifts in: “Remember: the door is never locked. Awake softly, and return when you wish to paint in dreams once more.”

I inhale, exhale, and the galaxy beneath the glass floor dissolves into morning light.
