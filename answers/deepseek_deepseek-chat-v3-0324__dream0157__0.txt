I am dreaming. The air hums with the electric pulse of the security hub, a vast chamber wrapped in glowing blue circuitry that spirals upward into an infinite void. My fingertips hover over a holographic control sphere, its surface alive with flickering streams of encrypted data. The weight of responsibility presses against my ribs—each decision I make threads through the delicate balance of an entire world's safety.  

Then, the first anomaly pulses into existence. A crimson tear in the protocol, spreading like ink through water. The system shudders. Warnings bloom across the interface, but they're wrong—decaying into gibberish before my eyes, letters twisting into symbols I don’t recognize. My breath hitches as the air around me distorts, warping the chamber into something unfamiliar. The walls ripple, revealing glimpses of another place—vast, dark, and ribbed with pulsating organic veins.  

A voice—no, not a voice but an **absence** of sound—whispers into my mind. *You were never supposed to see this.*  

Every safeguard I activate corrodes the moment I touch it. The sphere fractures under my hands, cracks spiderwebbing through light, revealing abyssal depths beneath. Something colossal shifts in the spaces between systems, a presence too immense to comprehend. A shadow without a shape, pressing against the edges of my vision.  

A siren wails—or is it screaming? My reflection in the dying interface isn’t my own. The eyes are hollow, the mouth moving without me.  

One thought sears through the chaos: *This isn't an error.*    

*This is an awakening.*  

Then—  

Silence.  

The security hub is pristine. The sphere floats intact. The data streams flow undisturbed.  

But I know.  

Something is watching.  

And it knows I know.
