I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Whispering Maze**  

I am dreaming.  

The air hums with tension, thick like syrup, as I stand at the entrance of an endless labyrinth. Its towering walls are woven from obsidian and silver thread, glistening under a sky that shifts between twilight and dawn. I know—somehow, deeply, unquestionably—that the center of this maze holds something I have desired for lifetimes. A voice, my own yet not my own, murmurs from the twisting pathways: *"You’ve always wanted this. Why do you hesitate?"*  

My feet feel rooted to the ground, not by chains but by the weight of a hundred unanswered *what ifs*. What if the path leads nowhere? What if the center is empty? What if, after all this striving, I am the same as when I began? The fear coils around my ribs, pressing like a second skin.  

Then, from the labyrinth itself, midnight-blue butterflies rise—their wings dusted with starlight—and brush against my cheeks, my hands, whispering as they pass: *"Disappointment is not the end. The maze is not your enemy; your stillness is."*  

I take a breath. The ground beneath me trembles, not in warning, but in anticipation.  

**So I step forward.**  

The walls rearrange themselves, not to trap me, but to guide me. Every turn is a pulse of possibility; every dead end dissolves like smoke when I dare to press my palm against it. The air tastes like ripe blackberries and thunderstorms, thick with the scent of rain that never quite falls.  

And then—just as the doubt begins to snake back into my thoughts—I round a corner and find it:  

A single door, wrought from ancient wood and etched with symbols that shift when I try to read them. Behind it, I know, is the answer, the treasure, the shadow of the thing I have longed for. My fingers hover over the handle.  

A choice.  

I could turn away—tell myself it’s safer not to know, that desire is a knife dressed in velvet.  

But then I remember the butterflies, the way the maze yielded when I dared to move.  

**I open the door.**  

(And the dream does not show me what lies beyond—because this is not the dream’s purpose. The purpose was the step. The opening. The defiance of stillness. The rest is mine to discover when I wake.)
