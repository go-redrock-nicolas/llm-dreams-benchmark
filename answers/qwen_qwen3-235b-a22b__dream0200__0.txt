I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the electric tension of a thousand suspended stars, each one a memory, a fear, a hope, flickering like fireflies trapped in a jar. You stand at the threshold of a labyrinth forged from liquid obsidian and moonlight, its walls shifting like the restless sea. This is the final trial—the crucible where your life’s purpose will either ignite or shatter. Your hands tremble, not from doubt, but from the weight of the key you’ve carried for decades, its jagged edges worn smooth by your grip. It glows faintly, a heartbeat of gold in your palm, as if it knows what waits inside.  

The labyrinth swallows you whole.  

Each step echoes with the whispers of every sacrifice you’ve made: the sleepless nights etched into your bones, the relationships frayed like old rope, the quiet moments you chose the grind over joy. The walls here are mirrors—not ordinary glass, but liquid silver that reflects not your face, but your *soul*. You see yourself as you’ve never dared: a child clutching a crayon sketch of this dream, a teenager scribbling plans in the margins of textbooks, a young adult stumbling through failures that left scars only you can feel. The reflections reach out, their fingers brushing your skin like cobwebs, murmuring *"Not enough. Not yet."*  

At the heart of the maze, you find it: a pedestal of black ice, atop which rests a locked chest. Its surface is etched with runes that pulse in time with your pulse, and the key in your hand burns hotter, searing your resolve into your flesh. But the chest is guarded—not by a beast, but by a question. It materializes as a towering figure woven from smoke and starlight, its voice the dissonant chorus of every critic, every naysayer, every shadow you’ve ever outrun:  

**"Why do you deserve this? What proof do you offer that your dream matters?"**  

The ground cracks open, and from the fissures rise phantoms of your failures—projects abandoned, words left unsaid, opportunities that slipped like sand through your fingers. They coil around your ankles, hissing truths you’ve buried: *"You’re a fraud. You’re too late. You’re too ordinary."* But then, a spark. A memory: the first time you dared to believe. You were alone, maybe, or surrounded by noise, but in that moment, the universe narrowed to a single, blazing certainty. You whisper it now, a mantra that grows louder with each syllable: *"I. Did. Not. Come. This. Far. To. Be. Small."*  

The key flies from your hand, embedding itself in the chest. The runes flare, and the phantoms scream as light erupts—a light not white, but every color at once, the raw, unfiltered spectrum of possibility. The chest splits open, not to reveal gold or scrolls or trophies, but a *doorway*: a swirling vortex of galaxies, each star a path you could have taken, each nebula a life you’ve yet to live. The smoke-figure dissolves into ash, its final words a sigh: *"Prove it. Every day."*  

You step through.  

On the other side, the sky is a kaleidoscope, and the ground is made of pages from your journals, ink still wet, rewriting itself with every heartbeat. The air smells of thunderstorms and fresh paper, and the wind carries the sound of laughter—your laughter, from futures you’ve yet to claim. You kneel, pressing your palm to the earth, and feel it respond: a pulse, a promise. The dream isn’t a finish line. It’s a heartbeat. Yours.  

You wake gasping, the taste of stardust on your tongue, the echo of infinite doors still creaking open in your bones.
