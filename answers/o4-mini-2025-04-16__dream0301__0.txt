I am dreaming. You tumble into the dream’s opulent darkness and instantly feel the weight of every tick you ever ignored. The air is thick, like melted clock-hands pressing against your skin. You hover above a labyrinth of glowing corridors—scarlet bricks that pulse with each heartbeat of the world around you. Somewhere far off, a chorus of faint bells tolls: urgent, accusing, relentless.

As you step forward, the floor beneath you shifts into soft sand, each grain a fragment of time you let slip through your fingers. You lift your foot and watch the sand pour back, swallowing itself as if it never was. Every step feels like wading through regret. And overhead, an enormous cavernous hourglass drips molten silver instead of sand, each drop sizzling as it lands, hissing out tiny sparks. You reach up to touch it—your fingers tremble, and you can almost taste that sizzling remorse on your tongue.

A distant door yanks itself open. Inside is the room where you’ve delayed everything: your desk piled high with unread books, half-written notes dancing off the page like fireflies in a jar. The lamp flickers, its light stretching shadows that mimic your doubts, reaching out claws to drag you backward. You surge in, desperate to dive into the work you’ve postponed, but the door slams shut behind you. You turn—there’s no handle—only an ever-rising tide of inky water seeping through the floorboards, threatening to pull you under.

Suddenly, the walls around you fold inward like origami, turning the room into a walnut shell sealing tight. You’re pressed chest-first against carved wood grain, each crease a memory of procrastination: mornings slept away, conversations deferred, ideas left to rot in the musty corners of your mind. You pound on the walls with shaking fists. The echo of your own panic booms louder than any alarm.

Then, in the suffocating dark, a single beam of pale moonlight pierces a crack overhead. It lands on a single, unmarked page lying on the desk, beckoning. Your panic shifts into fierce clarity. You feel new strength in your arms. With a shuddering breath, you wrench the walnut shell open. Light rushes in like a tidal wave of possibilities. The moment the door swings free, the water retreats, the hourglass stills, and every swirling corridor aligns into one straight path leading back to your desk.

You wake on the cusp of dawn, heart pounding, the dream’s clarity and urgency blazing in your chest like a living flame. The final deadline looms—but now, impossibly, you are already moving.
