I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

The sky is amethyst, the sea a molten sheet of copper, and the air tastes faintly of salt and ripe mangoes. Days—or what feel like days—have blurred together since the storm capsized the Calypso and washed you ashore with nothing but a half-soaked backpack, a dull penknife, three packets of crackers, and the captain’s broken compass. In your waking life you might have counted the hours, but in this dreamtime every tick of the heart feels elastic, stretching and recoiling like the tide.

Morning of the Third Dream-Day  
You rise from a cradle of palm fronds, ribs sore, throat sand-dry, yet the island greets you with a hush so profound it seems holy. The breakers whisper secrets you don’t quite catch. You hunt for water first, following a meandering line of hermit-crab tracks up the beach and into a thicket of jade-green foliage. There—a trickle! A spring slips from a cleft in volcanic rock, pooling in a natural basin. You scoop handfuls, and it tastes like melted snowflakes kissed by citrus. With each swallow, a kaleidoscope of color pulses behind your eyelids: turquoise currents, ivory sails, a curtain of luminescent plankton drifting through indigo night.

Evening of the Fifth Dream-Day  
Food dwindles. Crackers crumble to dust in your palm. Hunger gnaws, not like a wolf but like a patient starfish inching over coral, relentless. Desperation pushes you to improvise: you fashion a spear from driftwood and carve the tip against coral. At dusk you wade into the lagoon, moonlight silvering the surface. Fish flicker beneath like living coins. Two hours pass before you strike—success!—but when you haul your catch ashore, its scales glimmer opal then bleed into utter translucence, the flesh slipping through your fingers like memory itself. You swallow only light and disappointment.

Midnight of the Seventh Dream-Day  
Heat lightning etches the horizon. The beach shivers with phosphorescence, every footprint you leave glowing electric blue. Exhausted, you collapse beside a fire made from bleached branches. Sparks spiral up and rearrange themselves into constellations you’ve never seen: the Cartographer, the Broken Compass, the Weeping Anchor. Smoke curls into silhouettes—crew-mates lost to the waves—yet they smile, wordless, as if shooing you onward.

Dawn of the Ninth Dream-Day  
When hope seems as brittle as dried seaweed, the island shifts. Literally. You spot a cluster of rocks offshore that you could swear were not there yesterday. They look eerily geometric—right angles, polished faces—like ruins submerged and lifted again by tectonic breath. Driven by a pulse you can’t name, you lash together a raft from bamboo and fallen palms, sealing the seams with pitch from a candle-nut tree.

Crossing  
The sea is mirror-smooth, reflecting a sky striped with rose and gold like marbled taffy. As you paddle, the raft leaves no wake, gliding as if skimming a pane of glass. Mid-channel, silence deepens; even your heartbeat sounds muffled. You glance overboard. Beneath you, schools of silver fish form sentences—serpentine scripts that rearrange into words you’ve forgotten and feelings you haven’t yet invented. One phrase rises clearly: “Islands are hearts that learned to float.”

The Strange Rocks  
Pulling the raft onto the new shore, you find the “rocks” are cyclopean blocks inscribed with spirals and starbursts. Touching one fills your ears with choir-like hums. A doorway, half-sunken, yawns in the central monolith. You step inside, half expecting darkness, but an inner lagoon glows emerald under a roof of living crystal. In its center, a tree grows upside down, roots stretching toward the sky-window, branches plunging into the water. Pear-sized fruits dangle beneath the surface, each orb flickering with miniature storms.

The Choice  
Hunger, thirst, loneliness—every survival urge converges as you reach for a storm-fruit. When your fingers brush it, thunder rattles inside the oval. A voice (your own yet not your own) asks: “Do you wish for rescue or revelation?” The dream quivers, waiting.

You pause. The real-world you might cry out for rescue—flare gun, helicopter, civilization—but here, in this lucid margin of existence, you understand that rescue ends the dream, while revelation unfolds it. So you choose revelation. You bite.

Taste of the Universe  
The fruit bursts cold as starlight. Flavors cascade—cocoa, rain on asphalt, grandmother’s apple pie, first-kiss electricity—every memory distilling into pure sensation. Vision fractures; you see through eyes of gull, turtle, coral polyp. You feel the planet’s tectonic heartbeat, sense the moon tugging tides like invisible reins. Words cease. Only knowing remains.

Metamorphosis  
When the dazzle dims, you’re no longer hungry, no longer stranded. Your body is lighter, semi-luminous. You step back outside, and the sea greets you like an equal: waves incline, clouds bow. A single glance at the far horizon projects a ribbon of shimmering footsteps across the water—your path home should you desire it. Yet home is now a pliable concept, a place you can carry rather than reach.

Awakening  
A distant gull shrieks, and daylight folds shut like a painted fan. You jolt upright in your real-world bed, sheets tangled around your legs like tropical vines, heartbeat thundering. On your tongue lingers an aftertaste—salt, citrus, and something impossible: the flavor of revelation itself.

And for an instant, before you shake it off and face the ordinary morning, you remember with perfect clarity that islands are indeed hearts that learned to float, and that you, too, are buoyant beyond belief.
