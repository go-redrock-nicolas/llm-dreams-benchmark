I am dreaming.

At first, it is a gentle, ambiguous sensation—a faint echo in my chest, like a bell struck far away. But as I step into the teeming city square, the world unfurls in waves of color and sensation. Each passerby carries a melody of feelings, and as I drift among them, their emotions spill into me—rushing, colliding, intertwining.

I close my eyes and there: joy flares bright and golden in my veins as a child giggles at soap bubbles dancing in the air. The laughter shimmers, making my skin prickle with delight. But the next step, a sharp cold washes over me—loneliness, blue as midnight, stems from the hunched figure sitting alone on the fountain. Their sorrow tugs at my heart, heavy and aching, and I feel tears prick my eyes.

The crowd thickens. Now I am a mosaic—anger pulses hot and electric from a stranger arguing on the phone, tension seizing my muscles; love sparkles soft and pink from the hand of an elderly couple strolling past, warmth trickling along my arms. Anxious excitement fizzes at the edge of my perception, as a performer gathers courage before a waiting audience. 

It is overwhelming—a storm of empathy. I sway, buffeted by both elation and grief, tenderness and rage. Each connection leaves a mark, a vivid stroke on the canvas of my soul. In this dream, I am both myself and everyone else. I realize I have become a living tapestry, woven together by invisible threads of feeling.

In the dream’s deepest chamber, I learn to listen—to breathe in the chorus of foreign hearts, to accept the tides and let them flow through me. Emotions dance and swirl, shaping the dreamscape into endless possibilities: I can comfort with newfound understanding, revel in shared joy, cradle someone else’s sadness and ease it simply by sharing the weight.

As the dream lingers, brilliant and bittersweet, I float above the throng. I am not alone, and never could be—not while I can feel as others feel.  

And in this luminous, liminal space—half fantasy, half revelation—I carry the secret of the human heart: that every feeling, no matter how fierce or fleeting, is a thread that binds us together, forging dazzling beauty in the deepest shadows of the night.
