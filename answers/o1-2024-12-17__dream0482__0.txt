I am dreaming. …find yourself in a place that simultaneously feels ancient and new, as if time has frayed to reveal multiple eras at once. You are standing in a circular courtyard paved with shimmering mosaic tiles—emerald snakes coil around scarlet phoenixes; silver moons dissolve into golden suns. At the courtyard’s center stands a single willow tree whose branches arc overhead, forming a natural canopy. An inexplicable hush seems to settle here, even though the sky churns with swirling clouds of plum and copper. 

This location is familiar. You’ve been here before in other dreams, always drawn by a pulling sensation in your chest, as if a whispering wind is calling your name. The recurring element is the Willow—its great trunk appears carved with spiraling symbols that look like a language from another world. Each time you dream, you see more of these glowing etchings. Tonight, new spirals have appeared, pulsing a faint light that reminds you of the flicker of distant lightning. They almost speak to you in flickers—like Morse code in luminescent form.

You approach the trunk, pressing a cautious palm to its bark. In response, the etchings surge with warmth, and a gentle breeze sweeps through the courtyard. The mosaic beneath your feet begins to shift. From the tiles, a path of bark and flower petals sprouts, leading away from the courtyard into a tunnel shrouded by dangling vines. Somewhere in the distance, you hear water trickling like laughter, echoing through the dreamscape.

As you follow the path, the environment grows more fantastical with every step. Bizarre, translucent flowers tower overhead, their petals shaped like butterfly wings, each cluster pulsing in pastel shades of turquoise and lavender. Crystalline dragonflies buzz about, weaving little fireworks in the air with trails of sparkling dust. Eventually, you come upon a gracefully arching stone bridge spanning a river so still it reflects the cosmic sky overhead as perfectly as a mirror. 

In the reflection of the river, you see yourself. But instead of typical features, your reflection glows with the same spirals you saw etched on the willow’s trunk. As you stare, the spirals on your reflection twirl like dancing galaxies, swirling until they form the image of another being—something both comforting and otherworldly, like a glowing, winged fox or a dream-guardian. You realize that the visitation of this being is the central mystery of your recurring dream.

A soft voice, more like musical chimes than a human tone, nudges at your mind: “Listen.” 

You peer across the bridge and see that beyond it lies an orchard of pale-blue fruit trees. Drifting among the branches are wispy, ghost-like creatures—perhaps spirits, each carrying a piece of parchment. They float from tree to tree, weaving an invisible tapestry of messages in midair. You sense they’re storing knowledge or memories. 

You follow them deeper into the orchard until you come upon a grand tapestry suspended between two massive fruit trees. It is woven of silver threads and swirling lines, just like the patterns on the willow. You watch scenes appear on the tapestry—childhood fears, unspoken confessions, wishes for the future, heartbreaks, small triumphs. Each image glows briefly before melting into the next, revealing an entire secret chronicle of your life’s undercurrents.

Realizing the tapestry is an external illustration of deeply buried emotions and experiences, you feel an overwhelming urge to interact. You reach out and see your hand, shimmering with the same etched spirals. The images on the tapestry quiver and rearrange themselves, converging on one focal symbol: a labyrinth.

A bloom of gentle light heralds your entrance into that symbolic labyrinth—yet somehow, at the orchard’s edge, a doorway appears. Stepping through, you stand in a vast corridor of hedges shimmering like living emerald walls. The labyrinth’s paths wander endlessly, but the white glow of your spirals illuminates a single route forward. With every twist and turn, you notice small details that tie back to your identity—objects from lost memories, ghostly silhouettes of once-forgotten friends, and pieces of old hopes that you’d set aside.

At the center of the labyrinth awaits a pool of starlight. Its scintillating surface reveals your face once more, but now you see the winged fox-like guardian from earlier. It speaks without words, transmitting a gentle understanding: this recurring dream pattern is your mind’s way of guiding you through hidden obstacles, urging you to reconcile your past, embrace your self-worth, and awaken the dormant potential you’ve overlooked. 

Suddenly, the labyrinth’s walls dissolve like morning fog, and you find yourself back by the willow tree in the mosaic courtyard. The fox guardian stands in front of you, luminous and calm. Gazing directly into its bright, knowing eyes, you sense the message crystallizing within your soul: You are capable of growth and rebirth, but you must confront what you once hid from your own awareness. 

As you bow your head in gratitude, the edges of the dream shimmer with dawn-like light. The swirling sky overhead fades into a golden haze. You feel the final echo of the breeze ruffle your hair, carrying your new understanding out into the waking world. Then, with a deep, releasing breath, you awaken—heart aflutter, but bound by a deeper sense of self-knowing.
