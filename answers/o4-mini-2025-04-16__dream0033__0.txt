I am dreaming. Looking around for a way out, you press your back against the cold, damp stone and let your eyes adjust to the half-light. Stray beams of dust motes drift down from the gaping hole above, where vines sway in the faint breeze. Beneath your fingertips, the floor tilts slightly toward a narrow crack between two monolithic pillars—an almost imperceptible seam in the wall. Heart hammering, you pry at the ancient limestone and feel it give way to a hidden alcove.

Inside, phosphorescent moss glows in swirling turquoise patterns, painting pictographs of serpents and dancing figures across the walls. The smell here is sharp and loamy, like rain on petrified wood, and every breath tastes thick with centuries of undisturbed air. You slip through the gap and discover a set of winding steps carved directly into the living rock. Each step is worn smooth by time, and thin rivulets of water trickle down the handrail groove, cold enough to make your skin prickle.

As you descend, the cavern widens into a hollow where a shallow river courses past banks of crystalline quartz. Its surface shimmers in concentric ripples—each eddy reflecting glowing strands of fungus overhead like starlight trapped in stone. You pause to catch your breath, cupping water to your lips; it’s bracing, almost briny. Moments later, the river’s gentle murmur is joined by a low rumble—an echo from the temple’s shifting bones. Dust rains from the ceiling.

Your lungs burn; oxygen is precious. You must decide swiftly: follow the phosphorescent river into the unknown depths, hopes pinned on the promise of fresh air beyond, or double back through the narrow seam, risking collapse behind you. The walls groan. A bead of sweat trickles down your temple as you lean forward, toes on the edge of the first step, ready to plunge into the river’s luminous embrace—and whatever destiny waits in its hidden current.
