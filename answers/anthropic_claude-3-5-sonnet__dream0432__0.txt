I am dreaming. I find myself floating in a vast library that stretches infinitely in all directions, its shelves overflowing with books of every color, size, and age imaginable. Yet despite the overwhelming abundance surrounding me, I'm gripped by an inexplicable panic - a desperate feeling that I can't find the knowledge I seek. My hands tremble as they brush past countless spines, each one containing universes of wisdom, but somehow feeling empty and meaningless.

The library begins to shift and breathe like a living entity. Books flutter their pages like birds' wings, and waves of text float through the air like schools of silvery fish. I try to grasp at the floating words, but they slip through my fingers like mercury. The more I reach, the more they dance away, taunting me with their proximity yet remaining forever just beyond my grasp.

Suddenly, I realize I'm wearing a pair of dark glasses I didn't know I had on. When I remove them, the world explodes into clarity - the books aren't just books anymore, but radiant crystals of pure understanding, each one containing fragments of universal truth. The scarcity was an illusion created by my own filtered perception.

The panic subsides, replaced by a profound sense of peace as I float among the infinite knowledge, no longer trying to capture or possess it, but simply existing within its embrace. The library pulses with a gentle, knowing light, as if acknowledging this revelation. I feel myself beginning to dissolve into the sea of wisdom, becoming one with the endless stream of information that has always been there, waiting patiently for me to simply open my eyes and see.

As the dream fades, I'm left with a lingering sensation of both vastness and intimacy - a reminder that sometimes our greatest perceived lacks exist only in the shadows cast by our own misconceptions.
