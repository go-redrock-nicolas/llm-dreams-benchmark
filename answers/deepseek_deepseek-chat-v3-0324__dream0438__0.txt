I am dreaming. And in this dream, I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, iridescent lake—its surface shimmering like liquid mercury under a sky streaked with twilight hues of violet and gold. I had come here to fish, drawn by whispers of a legendary silver-scaled trout said to grant wishes to those who caught it. My hands grip the smooth, worn wood of my fishing rod, the line cast far into the glimmering depths.  

But as I wait, the rhythm of the water lapping against the shore begins to sync with my heartbeat. The air smells of damp earth and wild jasmine, and with each breath, something tight in my chest loosens. I hadn’t realized how heavy I’d been carrying it—this unnamed weight, this quiet sorrow I’d tucked away like a stone in my pocket.  

Then, the tug on the line. A thrill races through me—*the fish!*—but when I reel it in, it’s not the silver trout. Instead, tangled in the line is a small, waterlogged box, its hinges rusted shut. Curiosity overrides disappointment. I pry it open, and inside rests a single, luminous pearl. The moment my fingers brush it, memories surge like a tide: laughter I’d forgotten, tears I’d refused to shed, the warmth of a hand I hadn’t held in years.  

Tears slip down my cheeks, not from sadness, but from release. The lake seems to hum in response, the water glowing softly as if lit from within. I came here seeking a wish, but the water has given me something else entirely—an unburdening, a quiet mending of something broken inside me.  

I sit there for what feels like eternity or mere seconds, cradling the pearl as the sky shifts from twilight to dawn. And when I finally wake, the weight is gone. The dream lingers, not as a fantasy, but as a tender, glowing truth—that sometimes, healing finds us in the places we least expect.
