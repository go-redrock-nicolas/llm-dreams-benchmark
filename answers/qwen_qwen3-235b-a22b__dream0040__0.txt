I am dreaming. You stand at the edge of the arena, the Olympic Stadium stretching before you like a coliseum carved from starlight and thunder. The air hums with the collective heartbeat of 80,000 souls, their cheers a tidal wave that crashes against your ribs. Above, the night sky has been peeled back to reveal a swirling aurora, its emerald and violet ribbons dancing in time with the music that hasn’t yet begun. This is not just a competition—it is a crucible. A reckoning. A story written in sweat and fire.  

Your event? The decathlon’s forgotten cousin, a mythic hybrid of gymnastics, parkour, and aerial ballet, performed on a shifting labyrinth of floating platforms and mirrored beams that hover like shattered glass over a pool of liquid mercury. The course breathes. It *knows* you. Each element rearranges itself in response to your heartbeat, your breath, the flicker of doubt in your mind. You’ve trained for this since childhood, but the dream has twisted the rules. Now, the final trial demands more than physical perfection—it requires you to outrun your own shadow.  

The starting horn blares—a sound like a glacier cracking—and you launch forward. Your first leap carries you onto a beam that wasn’t there a moment ago, its surface etched with constellations that glow beneath your feet. The crowd’s roar becomes a physical force, a wind that threatens to topple you as you balance on a sliver of light thinner than a blade. You don’t just tumble or sprint; you *transform*. Your body arcs into a helix, limbs unraveling like ribbons, as you vault onto a swinging pendulum of polished obsidian. Time dilates.  

The dream remembers your scars. It weaves them into the performance. You see flashes of your childhood bedroom—the peeling posters, the chalk-dusted floor where you practiced flips until your knees buckled. You smell the antiseptic sting of training room ointments, hear your coach’s voice: *“You’re not here to be good. You’re here to be unforgettable.”* Now, every sacrifice crystallizes into motion.  

Midway through the course, the mercury pool below begins to rise, its silver surface coalescing into serpents that coil around your ankles, trying to drag you into the depths. You kick free, soaring toward a trapeze forged from frozen lightning, and swing into a somersault that fractures the air into prismatic shards. The shadow you must outrun materializes behind you—a doppelgänger with your face, but hollow-eyed, whispering every fear you’ve ever buried: *“You’ll falter. You’ll burn out. You’ll vanish.”*  

But here, in the dream’s marrow, you are more than flesh. You are a symphony of defiance.  

As you land the final sequence—a dismount off a beam that dissolves into stardust upon contact—the stadium erupts. The aurora above ignites, casting your silhouette onto the clouds, a giant flickering against the sky. The judges’ faces blur into a kaleidoscope of approval, their scoreboards glowing with numbers that transcend mathematics. You don’t need to see the medal to know: this was never about gold. It was about becoming a myth, even if only for a breath before waking.  

Then, the dream fractures. You wake up gasping, your body tangled in sheets, the echo of thunder still vibrating in your bones.
