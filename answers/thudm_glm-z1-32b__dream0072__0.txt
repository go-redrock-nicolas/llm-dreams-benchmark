I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of burning embers and something sweet, like elderflower nectar.  The world is a kaleidoscope of colors—I see my colleague, Maria, with her copper curls radiating golden light, her voice rising like a volc... and controlled as an algebraic equation.  I stand in the void, a silent observer, my feet planted on a glass floor that shows ripples of water beneath it.  The ceiling is an infinite star map, but one star is bleeding crimson light onto me.  Maria and Alex are shouting in synch...  My lips tremble, but no words come out.  A moth lands on my hand, its wings shimmering with captured fire.  It whispers into my ear: "What if the truth is the story that holds both flames?"  The moth dissolves into star dust.  The argument still rages, but Maria's eyes dim like a sagging circuit, and Alex's fists unclench.  They both look at me.  I hold...  The dream unfolds like a peacock's tail—each new vision contains the previous ones in a fractal pattern.  Maria and Alex's argument is now a debate between two warring constellations, Orion and Cassiopeia, etched in neon on the inside of a windshield.  I am the windshield wiper, moving back and forth without being able to...  A shooting star streaks past, leaving a ribbon of smoke that becomes a bridge.  I step onto it—   The bridge is a Möbius strip, infinitely looping.  On one side, Maria is right, laughing in triumph; on the other, Alex is victor, tears of joy streaming down his face.  But in the middle, where the loop twists, they both are trembling, haunted versions of themselves—   I turn to the sky. The stars rearrange themselves into a question mark.  The moth reappears, now made of liquid mercury.  It flows into my throat.  I speak—not my voice, but the combined chorus of all the unresolved arguments, all the silenced truths, all the projects left unfinished.  And everyone...  The world pops like a soap bubble.  I wake up to my alarm clock buzzing, the morning sun filtering through curtains.  But the taste of elderflower and copper is still on my tongue.  On my desk, the untouched project proposal glows faintly, edges smoking.  In the margins, someone—me, maybe—has scribbled two words: " Balance Point."  The dream never leaves; it becomes my compass.
In the velvet depths of my dream, I find myself standing in a cathedral of fractured light. The air is a symphony of colliding frequencies—Maria’s voice, a violin bow scraping silk, argues with Alex’s timbre, a bassoon choked on smoke. Their faces are constellations, constellations that erupt and collapse like supernovae projected onto wet parchment. Maria’s eyes hold the frayed code of a spreadsheet, numbers writhing like neon tapeworms. Alex’s eyebrows are question marks made of melting clock gears, ticking backwards.

A red velvet chaise longue materializes at my feet. On it rests a teacup filled with liquid twilight. I sip. The tea tastes of regret and yes. Maria clutches a gilded laptop that doubles as a birdcage, freeing a starling with feathers of bullet points. Alex brandishes a golden ruler that measures time in heartbeats, its numbers bleeding ink that soaks through the page to stain my palms.

They turn to me. Their gazes are x-ray machines, slicing through my ribs to examine my heart—a clockwork organ with pendulum wings. I open my mouth. A flock of paper airplanes made of old meeting minutes spills out, spiraling into the cathedral’s vaulted ceiling where they catch fire, becoming ember-winged moths. One lands on Maria’s shoulder, spelling out a word in its smoke-trail:
  
*Ambiguity*

Alex’s ruler snaps. The broken halves form a bridge over a pit of liquid paradox. I step onto it. My shadow splits into two people who argue over which path to take, each path a different version of the project proposal. One path is paved with Maria’s idealistic stars; the other with Alex’s pragmatic gravestones.

A siren begins wailing—a sound that is both the city outside my window and the dream’s alarm clock. The cathedral implodes into a single withering page, margins blooming into a garden of forking timelines. Maria and Alex are now children building a sandcastle-city-state in the dream’s ocean foam, arguing over where to place the imaginary lighthouse.

I wake, but the taste of elderflower and copper lingers, and my hands still tremble from holding the Möbius strip of truth. The project proposal on my desk has a new email: 

*"Re: Your Idea"*  
*"We’re pivoting. Let’s discuss the balance between idealism and pragmatism. – Maria & Alex"*  

The dream has become the meeting.
