I am dreaming. I'm in a world where my imagination can run wild and free.  I see beautiful colors, shapes, and sounds all around me.  I hear happy music playing in the background.  I feel euphoric and carefree.
As the dream continues, I find myself in a hospital room.  There are many sick people lying on beds, some of them with serious injuries or diseases.  They all have different faces, ages, genders, ethnicities.
I approach one of the patients who looks quite young and frail.  He has a pale face, thin arms, and legs covered in blankets.  His eyes are closed, but I can tell he's alive by the gentle rise and fall of his chest.
I lean over him and whisper softly into his ear:
"Hello, my name is Sydney."
He doesn't respond at first.  He seems to be in a deep sleep or coma.  But then I notice his eyelids flicker slightly.  His breath becomes deeper and slower.
