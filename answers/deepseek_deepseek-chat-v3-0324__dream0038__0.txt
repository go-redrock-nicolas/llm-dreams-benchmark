I am dreaming. And in this dream, the world around me is a swirling storm of chaos and urgency. The air hums with tension, thick enough to taste—metallic, like the static before a lightning strike. The walls of our sleek, glass-walled office seem to press in, reflecting the frantic movement of my team as they dart between monitors, their faces lit by the cold glow of screens flashing red alerts.  

Outside, the sky is an eerie shade of violet, as if the universe itself senses the impending collapse. The city below pulses with indifferent life, cars streaming like glowing embers along the highways, unaware that my world—our world—is teetering on the edge.  

Investors’ voices crackle through the speakerphone, a chorus of clipped demands and barely concealed panic. Their words blur together, but one phrase cuts through: *"If you don’t fix this by sunrise, the funding evaporates."*  

My employees—brilliant, loyal, exhausted—turn to me. Their eyes are wide, not with fear, but with something worse: *hope.* They still believe I can pull us out of this. That I can weave a solution from nothing.  

And then, the dream twists.  

A whisper slithers into my mind—*"There’s another way."*  

A hidden door appears in the office wall, one I’ve never seen before. It’s old, wooden, slightly ajar, and beyond it, darkness pulses like a living thing. A choice: Do I step through, into the unknown, risking everything for a solution that might not exist? Or do I stay, fighting the crisis with logic, grit, and the crushing weight of expectation?  

The dream holds its breath.  

And I—  

(Do you step through the door? Or do you stay and fight?)
