I am dreaming. I awaken not in my bed, but on a vast, iridescent lily pad floating atop a cosmic pond. The water is not water at all, but liquid starlight—swirling constellations dissolve and reform as I trail my fingers through its depths. The sky isn't sky; it's an inverted cathedral of living stained glass, where each pane pulses with bioluminescent memories.

I suddenly realize this lily pad isn't floating—it's breathing. The edges rise and fall with the rhythm of some sleeping leviathan beneath the surface. With each exhalation, perfumed mist rises, and within each droplet, I see fractured reflections of past conversations. Mine. Others'. The same shared moments, but viewed through countless shifting prisms of perception.

Standing unsteadily, I notice figures across the pond. They're all me—or versions of me—each engaging with shimmering facsimiles of people from my life. One me laughs uproariously at a joke nobody actually made. Another weeps over an insult never spoken. The distortions grow more pronounced as my gaze travels outward—at the pond's far edges, the versions of events are unrecognizable, entire relationships rewritten in liquid starfire.

Then I see it: between me and these reflections, the waters still. For the first time, I recognize the brilliant, terrible truth—the pond isn't showing different realities. It's revealing how we each painted our own constellations across the same blank void of shared experience. The starlight isn't distorting—it's illuminating the weight we didn't realize we carried.
