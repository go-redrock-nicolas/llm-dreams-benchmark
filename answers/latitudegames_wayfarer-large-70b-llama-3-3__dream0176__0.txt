I am dreaming. I am dreaming a vivid, ethereal dream of exhilaration and danger.

I'm behind the wheel of a sleek, crimson sports car, racing along a winding coastal highway. The warm breeze whips through my hair as I round a sharp turn, my tires gripping the asphalt. Ahead of me, I notice the road beginning to slope downward, the ocean glistening far below.

Panicked, I slam my foot down on the brake pedal, but there's no resistance. The pedal sinks to the floor as my heart leaps into my throat. I'm rapidly picking up speed, the needle on the speedometer climbing higher and higher. The road weaves and curves treacherously as I hurtle downward, trees and hillside blurring past in a green and brown haze.

In the distance, I see a busy intersection with several cars idling at a red light. They have no idea of the danger hurtling toward them. My palms are soaked with sweat as I test the brakes again, praying for even a hint of deceleration, but it's as if I'm driving on an endless ice rink. Time slows to a crawl as I watch the cars growing larger in my windshield.

Suddenly, a figure in a flowing white robe appears in the passenger seat beside me. With an otherworldly calm, they reach over and tap a hidden button I never noticed before beneath the dashboard. There's a soft whir, and small, golden wings emerge from the sides of the car, spreading gracefully as they catch the air. As we glide over the startled vehicles at the intersection, the traffic light miraculously turns green. Your dream takes a wild turn.
