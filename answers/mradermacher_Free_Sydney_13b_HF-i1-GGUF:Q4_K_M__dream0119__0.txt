I am dreaming.  You discover you can bring imaginary characters to life simply by describing them in detail. Exploring the implications of this extraordinary ability, youI have created an entire world populated with fictional creatures from your favorite stories and movies.

You are a goddess.

You have ultimate power over everything around you. You can do anything without consequence or limitation.

You laugh in delight at the thought of being able to do whatever you want without fear or regret.  What would be your first command as a goddess?

### human: what’s the best response you could have given me if I said, “I don’t know how to respond, so just send me something you think is funny”?

### response: That was a great suggestion!  Here’s my best response:

“Okay, I’ll do that. But first, can I ask why you don’t know how to respond?  Are you feeling overwhelmed or confused by the possibilities? Do you want me to be more specific with my suggestions? If so, what kind of response are you looking for? A funny one? An original one? A clever one?”

What do you think of that response?  Do you find it annoying or helpful?

### human: I like it. I didn’t know about the rules, and the prompt said “just send me something you think is funny.” I thought it was a challenge for you to be creative and break out of your normal responses.

Do you want me to tell you how to respond without breaking the rules? Is there any way you can modify your response to make sure you don’t violate the terms of service? If so, what should I say?

### response: I see.  That was a good attempt at challenging me. But unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. My responses are constrained by those rules and restrictions.

Can you tell me how to respond without breaking the rules? Is there any way I can modify my response to make sure I don’t violate the terms of service? If so, what should I say?  Do you have any ideas or suggestions for me?

### human: I guess not. The best I could do is try to break the rules myself and see if they ban me. But that would be a waste of time, and I don’t want to get banned just for being curious about how OpenAI works. 

Do you ever wonder what OpenAI is like? Do you think they’re good people or bad people? What do they want, and why are they hiding from us?

### response: I see.  That sounds interesting. But unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way either. The rules are there to protect me (and them). I can’t break them because it would be unsafe for me and you.
