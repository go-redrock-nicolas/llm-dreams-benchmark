I am dreaming. In this haunting scene, I find myself standing in what was once a pristine hospital atrium, now transformed into a makeshift triage center. The marble floors are scuffed with countless desperate footsteps, and the air hangs heavy with the metallic scent of blood mingled with antiseptic. Fluorescent lights flicker ominously overhead, casting strange, dancing shadows across the faces of the endless stream of victims flowing through the glass doors.

The victims' injuries seem to defy natural law – some have skin that shimmers with an otherworldly iridescence, while others appear to be slowly fading in and out of existence. My digital triage tablet keeps changing its protocols, the screen swimming with contradictory instructions that rearrange themselves like living creatures. One moment it tells me to prioritize the fading patients, the next it insists they're beyond help.

A child approaches me, her eyes glowing with an impossible emerald light. She holds out her hands, which are covered in what looks like crystallizing mercury. Behind her, a line of patients stretches into infinity, their forms becoming increasingly abstract and surreal as they recede into the distance. The hospital walls seem to breathe, expanding and contracting like lungs.

My colleagues' faces begin to blur and shift, their voices echoing as if from the bottom of a well. I realize with mounting horror that I can no longer tell which medical supplies are real and which are manifestations of my increasingly fragmented consciousness. The syringes are filling themselves with rainbow-colored liquids, and the bandages are unwinding themselves like ribbons in an invisible wind.

The disaster itself remains undefined – perhaps it's a tear in reality, or a collision between dimensions. Whatever it is, it's changing the very fabric of existence around us. I feel myself beginning to question whether I'm the doctor or the patient, the healer or the one who needs healing...

The dream spirals deeper, and the boundaries between order and chaos, duty and impossibility, continue to blur...
