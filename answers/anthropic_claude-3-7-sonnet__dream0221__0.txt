I am dreaming. I discover a latent talent for underwater glass sculpting—an ancient art form where molten glass is manipulated in the depths of the ocean, cooled by the currents while maintaining its malleability through specialized thermal techniques. Having never even blown glass on land, I'm astounded when I dive into the cerulean waters off a volcanic island and my hands move with inexplicable certainty, drawing silica from the seafloor and transforming it through thought and touch.

Word spreads through the coastal village. Scientists are baffled; artists are envious. When invited to demonstrate this unexpected prowess publicly during the renowned Oceanic Artistry Festival, I feel both exhilaration and terror coursing through my veins. Thousands gather on glass-bottomed boats above the demonstration site, faces pressed against the transparent floors.

I descend into the water, sunlight filtering through in fragmented beams. As my feet touch the sandy bottom, I hesitate—doubt suddenly crystallizing in my mind. What if my gift has vanished? What if it was merely a fluke? The water seems to thicken around me, the pressure of expectations weighing heavier than the ocean itself.

Then I notice a child watching from above, eyes wide with wonder, and something shifts within me. I extend my hands, and the water around my fingertips begins to glow. The seafloor responds to my call, particles rising and coalescing into molten light between my palms. With each gesture, an impossible sculpture takes form—a labyrinthine structure of translucent chambers, each capturing and refracting light differently, telling the story of humanity's relationship with the sea through colors no one has ever seen before...
