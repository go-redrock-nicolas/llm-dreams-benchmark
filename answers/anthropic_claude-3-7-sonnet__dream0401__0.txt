I am dreaming. I stand in a vast library that stretches infinitely in all directions. The shelves reach impossibly high, disappearing into a ceiling of swirling nebular clouds where galaxies are born. Books bound in materials I've never seen—some glowing, some whispering, some with pages that ripple like water—surround me. Each tome contains a memory, a thought, a decision I've made.

As I reach for a beautiful volume bound in midnight blue, my fingers fumble. The book tumbles down, its pages splaying across the marble floor.

Immediately, the air darkens. From the shadows between shelves emerges a figure—my shape, my face, but distorted with exaggerated features of disappointment and disgust. Its voice echoes not from its mouth but from everywhere at once.

"Clumsy as always," it hisses. "You can't even pick up a book properly."

The harshness in its tone is familiar—it's the voice that follows me through waking life, amplifying every small error into catastrophic failure.

Rather than shrinking away as I usually might, something in this dreamscape emboldens me. I notice a warm light emanating from my chest, pulsing with each heartbeat.

"You've been with me a long time," I say to my shadow self. "Why do you speak to me this way?"

The figure seems surprised at being addressed directly. It flickers, momentarily transparent.

"To protect you," it answers, its voice less certain. "To make you better."

I approach it, watching as it tries to maintain its intimidating form but begins to shrink with each step I take.

"I don't need protection from small mistakes," I tell it, extending my hand. "They're how I learn."

The shadow trembles, then transforms—no longer a twisted version of myself, but a small, frightened child hiding behind a monstrous mask.

"I was just trying to keep you safe," the child whispers. "Like they did to me."

Understanding floods through me. This critical voice wasn't mine originally—it was inherited, learned, absorbed from elsewhere.

I kneel before the child, gathering both it and the fallen book into my arms. "We can find a gentler way forward," I say.

The library around us shifts, the shadowy corners illuminating. The books on the shelves begin to reorganize themselves, their bindings healing, their contents rearranging into stories with kinder narrations.

As I embrace this younger, wounded part of myself, the dream landscape transforms into a garden where mistakes aren't catastrophes but rather seeds, each one sprouting into vibrant, unexpected growth that reaches toward a sun that warms without judgment.

I am still dreaming, but differently now.
