I am dreaming. I know it, because the sky outside the building pulses with an unnatural lavender hue, and the air hums faintly, like a choir of unseen voices whispering beneath my thoughts. The building is a labyrinth—no, a living thing—its walls shifting, breathing, watching.  

I’ve just stepped into a vast, cathedral-like hall, its arches ribbed like the inside of a whale’s belly. The floor is glass, and beneath it writhes a churning ocean of black serpents, their scales shimmering with anger. Every breath I take feels thick with salt and memory, and the faint taste of iron, like I've bitten into a star.

My mission is clear, though I don’t remember who told me: *you must find the living exit*.

That’s the only way out of this dream-borne prison—an exit that breathes, moves, and hides like a frightened animal.  

I start down the first corridor, drawn by a distant glimmer. Each step causes the floor tiles to bloom with glowing fungi, their tendrils reaching for my ankles like lovers. Ceiling panels creak above, and every so often, they drop small, chittering shadows that scatter underfoot like startled roaches with faces.

The first hazard is the **Weeping Mirror Room**. It appears without warning—a door made entirely of liquid mercury opens to reveal a reflecting pool housed in peeling walls that weep realistic tears. Any reflection I see in the mirrored water begins to move independently, smirking and pointing to unseen horrors behind me. If I stay too long, I’ll forget which version of me is real.

I dart past it, slipping just as the puddle of reflections begins to form a hand to grab my ankle, and stumble into the **Marigold Chamber**. Everything is covered in thick, golden pollen, and dust motes drift like fireflies. But each time they land on my skin, I *remember*—not my own memories, but someone else’s. A soldier’s last breath, a dancer’s broken toe, a child lost in the woods. Their sensations flood me, paralyzing me in grief for lives I never lived.

I claw the pollen from my face and run into a spiral staircase that folds and unfurls like a fern in fast-forward. Halfway up, the steps begin to peel away behind me, collapsing into a vortex of snowfall where time loops and rewinds—each flake a moment that never happened slipping into my eyes.

Suddenly, I’m in a hallway where the walls are made of **living vines**. They twist and coil, whispering secrets about my hidden fears. Some offer fruit that shines with the exact same color as my dreams back home—if I eat one, I’ll be trapped here forever, lulled into a slumber of perfect illusion.

I keep moving—because stopping means stagnation, and in this dream, stillness feeds the locust swarms that now descend from overhead, clattering like broken xylophones. They don’t eat flesh, only regret—and I have more than enough to feed an army.

Deeper now. The architecture warps entirely. I pass through a room where gravity pulls sideways. I'm forced to run along the walls, dodging ethereal figures—shadows of past dreamers who tried and failed to escape. Their hands reach for me in silent plea and warning.

Then I smell it. The **Exit’s Breath**—mossy, ripe with the scent of nebulas and fresh pencils. It’s near, but so are the new dangers.

Suddenly, the whole world turns inside out. Or perhaps reality is flipping like a giant coin. Corridors become ceilings, ceilings become doorways, and behind me comes the **Wailers.** Tendrils of sound with legs and eyeless faces, they scream in slow tones that age everything they touch. I see my skin rapidly wither, then revert—as though time falters and catches itself mid-attack.

I race forward, lungs burning with dreamsblood, until I reach a room filled with floating doors—each one a swirling portal into a different potential end. One shows a forest made of violins. Another, a desert where the sand screams when stepped on.  
One glows—*living*, *warm*, and breathing like a newborn.

I reach toward it as chains descend from nowhere, made of frozen lightning. Time is collapsing faster now, the dream sensing its end.

With a final leap—an exhale of light and featherless flight—I burst through the living door.

And I awaken, heart pounding, the scent of alien pollen still clinging to my skin, unsure if I’ve truly escaped... or if the dream is just beginning.
