I am dreaming. … drift through a half-light that feels thick as honey, and then—without warning—the world around you tilts and settles into focus.

You’re standing in the middle of an immense railway station that seems carved from moonstone. The vaulted ceiling glitters with constellations that wheel and shimmer in slow motion, as though the night sky itself has curled inside to shelter you. Trains arrive and depart soundlessly on luminous tracks of liquid silver, each carriage labeled with a single word—“Childhood,” “Graduation,” “First Home,” “Heartbreak,” “Triumph.” You realize these are the milestones you have already mastered, places you’ve visited and left behind. Yet tonight their doors stay locked; you are not meant to board them again.

A new platform has appeared at the far end of the concourse. Its sign flickers, refusing to resolve into anything you can read, and when you try to approach, the floor becomes a river of shifting tiles. They slide away beneath your feet, rearranging themselves so you march in circles no matter how determined your stride. The frustration wraps itself around your ribs—how can a dream replicate the exact stuckness you feel in waking life? Suddenly the walls bow outward, swelling like lungs, and a crystalline voice announces through unseen speakers: “You have danced this waltz before, yet you pretend you have forgotten the steps.”

With that, the scene fractures.

You’re treading water in an indoor ocean the size of a cathedral. Marble pillars rise from the waves, draped with flowering vines that glow bioluminescent blue. Storm clouds roil beneath the arched glass roof instead of above it, defying gravity. Each swell brings you face-to-face with a different version of yourself—one younger, one older, one wearing clothes from an era you never lived. They float by upon driftwood rafts, offering you items you can’t quite grasp: a compass spinning madly, a key made of frost, a pocket watch whose second hand ticks backward. “We already gave you everything you need,” they murmur as they pass, “but you keep waiting for permission to use it.”

You swallow a lungful of briny air, and the ocean transforms into a library. The water drains upward like smoke, shelving itself into translucent waves that petrify into corridors of glass. Books line every surface, yet their pages are blank; the story that belongs here is the one you haven’t started writing. In the hush, you sense movement overhead. A silver ladder descends from a gap in the ceiling, swaying gently. Though there is no obvious destination—only darkness beyond—you know the ladder is your exit, the path toward the unnamed platform.

Climbing feels easier than walking did moments ago. Each rung you grip becomes warm, then hot, then cool again—like metal touched by sunlight and shadow in quick succession. Halfway up, words flare across the ladder’s sides, sentences trailing away as fast as you can read them:

“You handled the first farewell with grace.”
“You crossed oceans of doubt wearing only laughter.”
“You learned the foreign tongue of grief and still sang.”

These lines burn themselves into memory, proof that your past victories are not illusions but currency you can spend on the next unknown.

At the top you emerge onto a ledge that appears to hover in open sky. Dawn’s earliest blush paints the clouds below, but the horizon ahead is pure possibility, uncolored, uncommitted. A locomotive of hammered copper idles there, its engine rooted not to rails but to a single enormous clock hand sweeping across thin air. The nameplate, at last, clarifies: “Becoming.”

The conductor—an androgynous figure with eyes like kaleidoscopes—tips their hat and says, “Tickets are written in courage.” You reach into your pocket and find a palm-sized shard of mirror. When you angle it toward your face, the reflection isn’t the anxious version of you from yesterday; it’s the collected mosaic of every self that rose after every upheaval. This composite you is smiling.

The conductor nods as though that smile is all the proof required. A door slides open, bathing you in molten sunrise. You step across the threshold, heart hammering not from fear this time but from the exhilaration of movement.

As the train lifts into the sky, tracks appearing beneath it only at the last instant, you look down. The station, the ocean, the library—each dissolves into motes of light, then folds inward, settling into the mirrored shard now tucked safely in your hand. You sense you can call upon their lessons whenever the waking world feels too unfinished.

And just as the engine hum merges with the first birdsong of morning, you awaken—no longer stuck on the platform between what was and what might be, but already, irrevocably, in transit.
