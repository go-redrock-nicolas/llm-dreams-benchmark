I am dreaming.

I find myself standing on the underside of a great floating city, its towers dangling like stalactites from a sky painted in swirling lavender and gold. Gravity tugs me upward, not down; I must cling with my fingers and toes to the cobblestone arches, feeling the pulse of the city through the warm stone. With each heartbeat, the buildings breathe and shift, their windows blinking gently like eyes in a drowsy giant’s face.

Light behaves strangely here. Shadows shine with iridescent color, splashing rainbows wherever I step, while the sunlight is cool and weighty, pressing against my skin like velvet. I reach for a fruit hanging from an upside-down tree—its branches dip low from a ceiling of clouds—and as I bite in, flavor flows out with sound, every chew filling the air with the ringing of tiny silver bells.

Here, cause and effect have danced away from one another. If I wish to cross a river of rippling blue glass, I must first imagine myself on the far shore, and only then do my footsteps ripple backward, rewriting the bridge behind me in a trail of golden moss. My words come out as spheres, floating softly from my mouth; when I wish to speak, I cup my hands and release them into the air, where they hatch into delicate origami birds and flutter off to be understood.

To survive in this world, I stop searching for logic and surrender to intuition. I listen to the silent music humming beneath the stones. I understand that I must unravel my questions before I can understand the answers, that I must leap before I know where I will land. Each breath fills me with possibility, and I realize that in this place of inversion and wonder, survival is less about clinging to what I know and more about embracing the mystery, letting strangeness be my guide, and dancing with the unknown as if it were an old and cherished friend.
