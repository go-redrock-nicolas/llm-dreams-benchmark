I am dreaming. I am speeding through the deep, dark streets of an unknown city, racing through a labyrinth of unfamiliar allies amidst a dull metallic whirring.

Suddenly, I arrive in front of a building emitting a faint, pulsating glow. Inside, I find myself amidst a grand auditorium filled with luminous figures waiting in silence.

I know this is the stage where I must perform for the final phase of the most crucial competition of my life. Lifelong experts from all corners of the world have tapped their knowledge and honed their skills to reach this point. And here I am, having only begun learning this discipline just months ago.

As the room erupts in applause, I step forward, my heart pounding like a thunderous symphony. With each passing second, I become intensely aware of the energy radiating from the audience. This is my momentâ€”my time to showcase the mastery I have cultivated so quickly.

With unwavering focus, I call upon the depths of my skill, weaving together every scrap of knowledge and technique I've absorbed. In that moment, time seems to stand still as I deliver a breathtaking performance, leaving the crowd in awe of what's been achieved.

As I finish, the room once again fills with thunderous applause, but the sound feels distant. I'm flooded with a profound sense of exhilaration. Despite the challenge that lay before me, I have prevailed, and now I own the moment.

I am dreaming.
