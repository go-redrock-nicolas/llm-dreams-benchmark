I am dreaming. # The Threshold of Seasons

I find myself standing before a colossal door embedded in the trunk of an impossibly wide tree. The door is split perfectly down the middle—one half gleaming with frost crystals that never melt, the other half adorned with vibrant moss and tiny blooming wildflowers. My reflection splinters across the icy portion, while the mossy side seems to breathe with gentle undulation.

Without touching it, the bifurcated door swings open. Inside, a spiraling staircase—half carved from blue ice, half grown from living wood—descends into darkness. The air carries two scents that shouldn't coexist: the sharp bite of winter wind and the humid sweetness of spring soil.

As I descend, each step shifts beneath my feet—sometimes cold and slippery, sometimes soft and yielding. The walls around me tell stories in moving murals: on one side, scenes of hibernation, preservation, and solitude; on the other, scenes of growth, connection, and transformation.

I reach a circular chamber where a figure sits at a round table. The figure is simultaneously ancient and infantile, familiar yet utterly unknown. Half their face is serene and weathered, the other half curious and unmarked by time.

"You've been living between worlds," they say, voice harmonizing with itself in two distinct tones. "Between what you've always done and what you might become."

They gesture to two goblets on the table—one filled with crystalline blue liquid that steams with cold, the other with iridescent green nectar where tiny lights dance just beneath the surface.

"The comfortable path preserves. The unknown path transforms. But neither is complete without acknowledging the other."

With trembling hands, I realize I'm meant to choose—or perhaps to blend them? The chamber begins to rotate slowly, the boundaries between ice and wood, between familiar and strange, becoming less distinct with each turn...
