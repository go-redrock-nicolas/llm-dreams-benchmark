I am dreaming. stepping onto the stage feels like emerging from cool shadows into the sudden, intense warmth of a miniature sun. The spotlights are dazzlingly bright, washing out the edges of my vision and making the polished wooden floorboards beneath my feet gleam like dark honey. A low, expectant hum fills the vast space, a collective held breath from the immense sea of faces stretching out before me, fading into the velvety darkness at the back of the grand hall. Thousands of eyes, like countless tiny, reflecting pools, are fixed solely on *me*. My heart is a frantic bird beating against my ribs, its rhythm echoing the palpable anticipation in the air.

I approach the imposing lectern, its surface cool and smooth beneath my trembling fingertips. In my hand, I clutch my notes, though suddenly the typed words seem to swim and blur, rearranging themselves into unfamiliar symbols. A wave of dizziness washes over me. I grip the edges of the lectern, anchoring myself. Taking a deep, shaky breath that tastes strangely metallic, like ozone before a storm, I clear my throat. The small sound echoes unnervingly in the profound silence.

I open my mouth, intending to launch into the powerful opening statement I'd rehearsed countless times... but what emerges isn't sound. It isn't words. Instead, a glittering ribbon of pure, liquid moonlight unfurls from my lips, cascading downwards like a silent waterfall. It pools shimmeringly at my feet before flowing outwards, weaving intricate, silvery patterns across the stage floor. It emits no sound, yet I can almost *hear* it â€“ a high, celestial chime resonating deep within my bones.

I stare, utterly bewildered, my intended speech completely forgotten. I try again, concentrating fiercely, willing the words to form. This time, a cloud of miniature, iridescent hummingbirds bursts forth, their wings beating impossibly fast, filling the air around the lectern with silent, frantic energy. They hover for a moment, jewels of emerald, sapphire, and amethyst, before darting out over the audience.

The crowd doesn't gasp or murmur in shock. Instead, a slow wave of collective wonder seems to ripple through them. Faces that were taut with expectation soften into expressions of dreamlike awe. Some individuals slowly raise their hands, not in alarm, but as if hoping one of the tiny, impossible birds might land on their finger. The air grows thick and fragrant, smelling inexplicably of night-blooming jasmine and damp earth. The spotlights overhead seem to soften, their harsh glare shifting to a gentle, pearlescent glow. My panic melts away, replaced by a profound sense of surreal detachment and curiosity. The speech is gone, irrelevant. Something far stranger, far more mesmerizing, is happening, and I am somehow at the very center of this waking dream's beautiful, baffling performance.
