I am dreaming. The door to the room opens abruptly, revealing the shadowy outline of a figure in the doorway. The harsh light from the hallway casts a menacing glow around the intruder, obscuring their identity. 

You squint, trying to make out their face, but it remains hidden in the darkness. The dim light dances off the metallic object they're holding, sending shivers down your spine. 
"Who are you?" you demand, your voice trembling slightly. 

The figure steps forward, moving further into the room. Their footsteps echo ominously against the cold, tiled floor. The blade of a knife glints in their hand, catching the faint light from the window. 

They don't answer, but their presence feels dangerous, threatening. Panic wells up in your chest, but you force yourself to remain calm. You can't let them see your fear. 

"You need to leave," you say, trying to sound authoritative. "Whatever you want, we can talk about it without that." 

"Check!" you hear a faint voice from next room interrupting your demand. 

Your heart skips a beat at the intrusion. You glance quickly toward the other room, trying to comprehend the situation. 

The man moves inscrutably toward the table, his footsteps measured and deliberate. Your mind races, trying to grasp the implications of the chessboard on the table. The figures, their positions, their movements—there's something crucial about them, something you're missing. 

As the man advances, you feel a cold certainty settle over you. This isn't just a game; it's a life-and-death match. Your eyes dart between the chessboard and the intruder, desperately trying to piece together the puzzle before it's too late. 

### Scene Two: The Chessboard

The chessboard on the table is set up in a bizarre manner. The black pieces are arranged in a perfect defensive stance, while the white pieces seem scattered across the board as if the last pawn has been moved. One white rook and one black pawn are missing. 
A storm outside grows louder, the rain pounding against the windows. The wind howls through the cracks in the walls, sending shivers down your spine. Thunder rumbles ominously in the distance, each clap seeming to shake the very foundations of the ancient house. Lightning flashes, momentarily illuminating the room. 

You glance at the chessboard again. The pieces seem to have shifted since you last looked. The white king has been moved to a vulnerable position, exposed to an impending attack. 

A voice comes from the next room, clearer now. "Your precious little game," the man intones, his voice low and gravelly. "Do you even know what you're playing with?" 

You move slowly towards the table. Your hand reaches out towards the black pawn that was taken from its spot earlier. "This," you say, holding up the pawn with trembling fingers. "This is what's important. Isn't it?" 

The intruder doesn't respond, but you feel his eyes on you, watching your every move. 

"Do you...do you know who I am?" you ask softly, your voice barely above a whisper. 

"Of course I do," the man says. "You're the one who thinks they're in control. But you're not." 

Another flash of lightning illuminates the room. The rain has stopped, though the wind continues to lash at the walls. 
In the split second of brilliant light, you catch a glimpse of the man's face. 

It’s not human. 

His eyes glow with an eerie, unnatural light. His skin seems to stretch over angular bones, as if it were pulled too tightly across his features. 

The door slams shut. 

You drop the pawn. 

It hits the ground with a loud clatter. The sound startles you, and your fingers twitch involuntarily. 

"Who...who are you?" you ask again, but the room is silent. 

You take a step back, bumping into the bed. You sit down heavily, your heart pounding in your chest. 

"You're the one...the one who's been...watching," you realize. 

A cold laugh fills the room. 

"I've been waiting," the man says. "And now it's time." 

Outside, the storm returns with renewed force. The rain lashes at the windows with furious intensity, as if trying to break through. Inside, your mind swirls with confusion, fear, and a growing sense of dread. 

The chessboard remains untouched. The pieces seem frozen in place, as if they too were waiting for something. 

"Check," the man says again, this time more firmly. "You're in check, my dear. And this...this is your last move." 

He raises his knife. 

The storm crashes against the house. 

Lightning strikes nearby, the sound deafening. 

The man's voice fades. 

Everything turns black.
