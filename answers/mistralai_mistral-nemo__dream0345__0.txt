I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the middle of an expansive, vibrant meadow at the heart of a dream galaxies away from our world. The grass beneath my feet is like velvet, its hues shifting from emerald to sapphire as the light of an ethereal sun dances upon it. The sky above is not the familiar blue, but a canvas of soft purples and aquamarines, with wisps of cloud painted in gold. I can hear the rhythmic whispers of distant waterfalls, and the sweet symphony of melodic birdsong that seems to hum in tune with the very air.

In this dreamscape stands a figure, my dearest friend Letitia, whom I've known since we were but children. She appears as she always has, her laughter lines etched around her eyes, her hair a cascade of chestnut curls. Yet, there's an odd tension in her shoulders, a tightness around her mouth that wasn't there before. Her eyes, usually sparkling with warmth, now hold a strange, unsettled intensity.

Letitia begins to walk, her path taking her towards the edge of the meadow, where a thicket of luminescent flowers grows. As she approaches, the flowers sway, their petals ruffling like the pages of a book being turned. She reaches out, her fingers tracing the soft petals, but as she does, the flowers start to shrivel and turn to dust at her touch, leaving behind stark, withered stems. A chill runs through me, a stark contrast to the warmth of the dream, as I witness this unnatural scene.

She continues on, her steps measured, purposeful. In her stride, in her very posture, there's a determination that I've never seen before. It's not the stubborn resolve that ignites fire in her eyes when she's passionate about a cause, nor the quiet strength when she's shielding those she loves. This is something else, something darker, something... off.

I follow her, my feet sinking slightly with each step, the very ground seeming to complain at her passing. Letitia turns suddenly, her eyes meeting mine. They're not the warm brown I know, but swirls of malachite green and obsidian black. She smiles, but it's not her smile. It's a twisted mockery, a baring of teeth more than anything else.

"Letitia," I say, my voice hesitating on her name. "What's happening? You're scaring me."

She tilts her head, her smile never wavering. "Why would I scare you, dear friend?" Her voice echoes, resonating with an unnatural depth. "When I'm only doing what needs to be done."

I try to reach out to her, but my hand passes through her arm, leaving a trail of stardust that fades too quickly. She turns and walks on, her pace increasing, her form becoming more indistinct, fading into the shifting colors of the dream.

I stand there, alone in the ruined meadow, the whispers of the waterfall now muted, the bird's song harsh and discordant. I realize, with a sense of dread that's as cold as a winter's dawn, that I need to find Letitia, to understand what's happening to her. Because this isn't her. This isn't the friend I know. And whatever is causing this, it's running deeper than the roots of this dream meadow. I take a deep breath, ready to plunge into the heart of this dream, ready to face whatever darkness has taken root in my friend's soul.
