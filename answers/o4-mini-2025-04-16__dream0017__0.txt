I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The sky above you ripples like liquid opal, casting fractal rainbows across fields of towering moonflowers. A hush settles, and from the center of the glade a robed messenger steps forward—its face hidden behind a mask carved from midnight glass. In a voice that cracks like shattered crystal it speaks a single sentence of shattering weight: “Your most precious world has been lost.”

Instead of breaking down, you take a deep breath. The very air in your lungs hums with possibility. Exhaling, you watch that weight of grief fold in on itself, then bloom outward like a lotus of molten light. Around you, the moonflowers sigh, opening their silver petals to catch your calm.

You raise your arms, and the midnight messenger pauses, as if surprised by your steadiness. From your fingertips a pale glow unfurls—wisps of memory, tracing the shapes of what was lost. Rather than vanishing, those wisps gather into a swirling orb at your chest. You cradle it gently, and it pulses with warm, resonant echoes of love, laughter, sunlight on water.

Behind you, the glade dissolves into a stairway of living crystal. Every step you take sings with a different chord in a celestial symphony. You ascend, hand over hand, watching the orb of memory grow brighter in the cradle of your palms. At each landing you pause to touch the walls of this dream: one panel shimmered like the surface of a calm sea, another glowed with the whisper of ancient trees.

At the summit stands an ornate door carved from dawnlight. Without hesitating, you place the glowing orb into a carved niche on its face. The door swings open soundlessly, revealing a new landscape: an ocean of stars so close you feel the brush of starlight on your cheeks. Constellations drift by like lanternboats, and with each one you glimpse a fragment of strength you never knew you had—resilience shimmering in cosmic tides.

You step through the threshold, carrying both sorrow and peace, ready to explore this vast expanse. Here, in the boundless realm of your own dream, devastation becomes the seedbed of transformation—and you, its unshakable guardian, move forward into dawn’s gentle embrace.
