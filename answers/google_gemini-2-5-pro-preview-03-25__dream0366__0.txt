I am dreaming. Okay, the edges blur... I am dreaming.

The space around me is cavernous, a vast hall constructed from polished, obsidian-like material that reflects distorted versions of everything within it. The air itself feels heavy, thick with unspoken rules, tasting faintly metallic on my tongue. Tall, indistinct figures draped in seamless, dove-grey cloaks stand arranged in a loose circle. Their faces are lost in the deep shadows of their hoods, and instead of individual voices, a low, resonant hum emanates from the group – a collective sound agreeing, nodding, affirming a single, shared perspective.

They are discussing colour. Specifically, the colour blue. But not the boundless blues of reality; their consensus, echoed in the monotonous hum, settles on a single shade: a pale, washed-out, disappointingly timid blue. Like faded watercolour left too long in the sun. The humming swells, a wave of quiet insistence, pressing in on me from all sides. I *know* this isn't the whole truth of blue. Inside my chest, other blues clamour for air – the deep, electric indigo of a twilight sky just before the stars ignite, the ferocious turquoise heart of a breaking wave, the soft, hazy blue of distant mountains veiled in morning mist.

A knot tightens in my throat. My jaw feels wired shut. Sharing *those* blues feels like shouting blasphemy in a sacred space. The grey-cloaked figures sway gently, their reflections rippling like dark water on the obsidian floor. Conformity is a warm blanket here, safe and expected. To speak against the hum feels like stepping off a cliff edge into freezing wind. My own silence feels like a betrayal, a heavy cloak I'm forcing myself to wear. I can feel the vibrant blues pulsing beneath my skin, desperate for release.

Then, my gaze catches a flicker in the polished wall – not a reflection of the drab scene, but a sudden, impossible streak of pure cobalt. Deep, defiant, and utterly magnificent. It vanishes as quickly as it appears, but the image is burned behind my eyes. It’s the spark.

The impulse surges, hot and undeniable, pushing past the fear, past the suffocating weight of the collective hum. My breath hitches, and the words tumble out, louder than I intended, echoing strangely in the vast hall.

"No!" The hum falters, ripples of silence spreading outwards. "Blue isn't just... *pale*! It's not merely quiet resignation!"

The hooded heads begin to turn, slowly, unnervingly, like ancient statues disturbed from centuries of slumber. The air crackles with sudden tension.

"Blue is the **depth**!" I feel the words creating space around me, pushing back the oppressive atmosphere. "It's the crushing pressure of the midnight zone in the ocean, where light has never touched! It's the startling, vibrant shock of a kingfisher's wing flashing over water! It's the velvet cloak of night itself, dotted with diamond-dust stars! It’s the melancholy ache in a soulful melody, the sharp, clean tang of glacial ice! It’s ALIVE!"

As my voice rings out, something astonishing happens. The hum doesn't just stop; it shatters like brittle glass. The obsidian walls around us don't crumble, but they begin to *fracture*, like mirrored ice struck by a sudden force. Through the spreading cracks, pure, luminous colour doesn't just leak – it *floods* the space. Torrents of sapphire, waves of turquoise, splashes of indigo, rivers of cerulean pour in, swirling like living paint, displacing the oppressive grey dimness.

The grey-cloaked figures waver, their forms becoming indistinct. They don't attack or accuse; instead, they seem to... dissolve. Their grey cloaks unravel into glittering threads of starlight, drifting upwards into the riot of colour. The heavy, polished floor beneath my feet softens, shifts, and becomes a swirling nebula of blues, deep and endless.

The oppressive hall is gone. I am standing weightless, not falling, but suspended in an infinite expanse of the very blues I described. The air is clear and cool, tasting of freedom and starlight. There is no more pressure, no more expectation, only the breathtaking beauty of authentic expression made manifest. Fear lingers only as a faint echo, drowned out by an exhilarating sense of release and the profound, vibrant truth of colour unleashed. I take a deep, clear breath, surrounded by the boundless, brilliant blues of my own making.
