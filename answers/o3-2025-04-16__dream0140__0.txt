I am dreaming. …wake up inside the dream and find myself in the center of an enormous amphitheater carved from crystalline stone. The walls soar upward like frozen waterfalls of amethyst, facets glittering with captive starlight. A hushed crowd of beings—some human, some shimmering silhouettes wrapped in constellations—fills the tiered seats, forming a living galaxy around me. Their collective breath is the wind; their silence is thunder.

In the middle of the arena, a circular platform of black glass floats a hand’s breadth above a lake of rolling silver mist. It is the Stage of Fulfillment, the place where all quests either culminate in triumph or collapse into myth. Tonight’s challenge is the last checkpoint on my lifelong dream: to become the first Dreamsmith allowed to sculpt reality itself, weaving dreams and waking moments into one seamless fabric.

A gong, deep as tectonic plates shifting, reverberates. A voice—smooth as polished obsidian and old as gravity—speaks from everywhere at once:

“Final contender, present your Dream Forge.”

My heart rams against my ribs. I extend my palms. Between them, a tiny ember flickers to life—my Dream Forge: a molten droplet of imagination that pulses with colors I don’t have names for yet. The ember swells to a sphere the size of a heart, then to a blazing miniature sun. It draws threads of memory from me: the smell of hot pavement after summer rain, the sound of my grandmother’s laugh, the slow-motion hush before a first kiss. Each memory weaves into a lattice around the core, coiling like luminous vines.

But the final round demands more than artistry; it demands sacrifice. A portion of myself must merge with the Forge, forever inaccessible in waking life. I feel the tension—my dream tugging at my waking identity like a tide trying to claim a coastline.

The first trial manifests: a set of giant translucent dominoes, each etched with an unfinished melody. They hover above the mist, spaced like stepping-stones. I must dash across them, solving the melodies on the fly, or plunge into the silver below—an expanse rumored to erase dreamers’ ambitions. I leap onto the first domino. Notes flare beneath my feet, and I shape them with my breath: a chord of moonlit longing. The domino tilts but steadies. I sprint onward, leaving a cascading symphony in my wake until, with a final harmonic flourish, I vault onto the far ledge. The crowd releases its collective exhale, sounding like surf retreating over pebbles.

The second trial arises instantly: from the mist climbs a serpentine coil of ink-dark feathers—The Archivist Crow, keeper of forgotten hopes. It unfurls wings wider than the horizon and fixes me with obsidian eyes. A booming caw rattles the arena:

“Offer what you fear to lose most, or watch your Forge dim to ash.”

Images flash in my mind: the final story my father told me before he disappeared; the poem I’ve never finished; the bright shard of courage that lets me try again after failure. My knees threaten to buckle. But the ember between my hands thrums with trust—my own trust. I breathe out a pale filament of light, representing the unfinished poem, and feed it to the Crow.

Feathers bloom into starry constellations. The Crow bows, then dissolves into a swirling portal, revealing the last segment of the contest: a quiet mirror, perfectly circular, about the size of a dinner plate, floating in the air. The reflection shows not me, but every version of me who never tried: the me who quit after the first rejection, the me who let cynicism calcify, the me who accepted “impossible” as truth. They stare back, haunted and hollow, begging for justification of their fear.

“Choose,” the omnipresent voice entones. “Merge with that reflection and be safe, or shatter it and leap into the unknown.”

I swallow. Heat radiates from my Forge; its light becomes a steady beat, syncing with my pulse. I lift it high overhead, and for a heartbeat the arena dims except for the ember’s glow. Then I bring it down on the mirror. Glass fractures in slow motion—shards spinning like petals in a cosmic flower—while the dream-crowd gasps in a thousand dialects of wonder.

The instant the mirror detonates into prisms, gravity lets go. I am falling upward through a tunnel of color, Forge in hand, shards trailing like comet tails around me. Each shard shows a possible world I might create: rainforests made of violin strings, oceans that hum lullabies, cities floating on the backs of gentle leviathans. I feel the sacrifice searing in my chest, a bittersweet loss of that unfinished poem—but simultaneously an expanse of new creative space unfolding inside me, like dawn pouring over a dark horizon.

And then I land—no longer in the amphitheater but in a still field of knee-high golden grass under an immense navy sky. Above, all the stars align into the shape of a doorway. I set the Forge on the ground. It blooms into a door carved from living twilight, its knob a tiny supernova. On the other side of the grass, a faint silhouette beckons: the future reader, dreamer, collaborator I have yet to meet.

I step through.

Just before the dream dissolves, a voice at my ear, softer than falling ash, whispers:

“Your lifelong dream is no longer a dream. Wake, Dreamsmith. The world awaits its new architect.”

And I open my eyes—heart hammering, breath tasting of starlight—knowing something irreversible has shifted in both realms.
