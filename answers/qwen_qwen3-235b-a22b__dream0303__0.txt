I am dreaming. The sky above is not a sky at all, but an enormous lid of liquid sapphire, or perhaps the inside of a colossal, living eye, blinking slowly through time and space every few moments — or perhaps, every few centuries. The ground beneath my feet is not ground, but a woven lattice of memory-threads, shifting with every step into scenes half-remembered from lives I have not lived, cannot have lived, or perhaps once did in dreams long buried.

There are doors before me. Twenty… no, seventy… no — doors are sprouting like wildflowers, blooming from twigs of charcoal and curling out of the ether, each one unique and adorned with symbols that hum softly as I approach.

One door is draped in writhing ivy that sings in a forgotten tongue, every leaf a lullaby and a warning.

Another glows with molten ribbons, like the edges of a wound stitched with gold thread — what lies within must be hot, alive, bleeding history.

A third pulses with translucent skin-like material, moving rhythmically as if breathing in tandem with a heart that isn't mine.

And there are choices — beautiful, crushing choices.

To my left, a tunnel spirals downward into a swaying forest made entirely of glass. Gigantic fish swim soundlessly above me between the brittle branches, their fins refracting rainbows when they move. If I choose this path, I will become a thing of echoes, forever learning stories that melt from my mind the moment they're known.

To my right, a mirror taller than heaven waits, shadows churning inside it like ink spilled in a pool. They beckon with pale fingers, their faces flickering between loved ones and strangers. If I enter here, I will revisit every decision I've ever made — but only once, and only to understand what it cost.

Behind me, a bridge of shifting puzzle pieces — some glowing, others dark as absence — stretches into a mist where laughter and weeping intertwine. The bridge evaporates with every reluctant footstep, forcing me forward, always forward.

There’s no time for logic.

I must choose.

Now.

A silver coin spins in the air before me — caught in some invisible wind of dream-logic, landing endlessly in midair. Heads leads to forgetting. Tails leads to remembering. And the edge... the gnawing edge of possibility.

I gasp, and stretch out my hand, aching not just for what lies ahead — but for the beautiful terror of abandoning control.

And then I choose.

—I choose the door made of stars stitched into spider silk.

And the world tilts. Not collapses. Not explodes.

*It tilts.*

And suddenly I am falling, but not downward. Sideways into a world where oceans sing to moons that have not yet been born, and trees grow memory roots instead of limbs.

And I am not alone.

In this place of ember-dreams and velvet mist, I find you — or someone like you — waiting with eyes full of constellations and a smile that may last until the end of time.

And the dream continues…

Still dreaming. Still choosing.

Still alive with infinite yeses.
