I am dreaming. You are standing at the threshold of a vast arena whose walls ripple like liquid moonlight. Above you, the sky pulses in slow breathing—lavender one moment, molten silver the next—while distant thunder drums out the cadence of your own racing heart. You feel the soft tingle of grass beneath your bare feet, though the blades glint like spun glass, and every gust of wind carries the scent of wild rose and ozone, as if the world itself is exhaling anticipation.

A hush falls over the crowd, though no one sits in the stands: instead, a ring of towering mirrors surrounds the field, each surface reflecting a different version of you. One mirror shows the wide-eyed child who first dared to dream of greatness. Another shows the weary adolescent who almost gave up, shoulders bowed beneath the weight of doubt. They flicker and shift whenever you glance their way, as though breathing in time with your pulse.

A low gong reverberates, and the ground beneath your feet parts open into a spiral ramp carved from living crystal. You step forward, and with each footfall you feel memories—every triumph, every failure—rising up like golden motes in the air around you. Somewhere in the distance, a violin moans a single, yearning note; its echo weaves through the arena until even the mirrors seem to sway in time. Above, lanterns shaped like flaming lotus blossoms drift by, leaving trails of stardust in their wake.

You reach the center of the spiral and find a single, ornate chest perched on a pedestal of swirling mist. Its surface is etched with symbols you half-remember from childhood tales—keys unlocking skies, wings taking flight, hearts aflame. Your fingers hover over the latch, trembling with the weight of every expectation you’ve ever carried. Then, summoning the full force of your will, you lift the lid. A burst of light floods the arena, and in that instant the mirrors shatter into a million diamond fragments, raining down like shooting stars.

Time seems to slow as each shard catches the light and dissolves into dust. You feel a warmth blossom in your chest—an unshakable certainty that no matter the verdict, you have already become the person you were always meant to be. The thunder cracks once more, rolling into a victorious roar, and the arena dissolves around you into a glowing tunnel of promise. You step forward into the light—and awaken, heart pounding, certain that your future has already been written by this dream of infinite possibility.
