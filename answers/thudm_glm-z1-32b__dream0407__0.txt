I am dreaming. I am about to cross a moral boundary that my conscious mind would never permit, but in this dream realm, the rules are fluid, and the justifications cascade into my thoughts like a waterfall of muddy logic. I stand at the edge of a mirrored lake, each surface reflecting a different version of myself—— some versions bow with guilt, others smirk with cold purpose. The water stirs beneath my hand, and with a sinking sensation, I reach into the depths, expecting cold water but feeling the touch of velvet. The lake is alive, a sentient force that offers whispered excuses: "This is for the greater good. You've tried everything else. Look how others have failed; only you possess the power to act." My reflection in the water begins to split, one half clinging to ethics, the other half grinning maniacally. The air thickens with the scent of burnt sage and iron, as if my decision is being weighed by unseen observers. With each breath, the rationalizations grow louder, more compelling—until, finally, I step into the lake. The water devours me but also lifts me, spinning me into a vortex where my own moral code is rewritten in bioluminescent letters. The act I was about to commit isn't canceled—it's reconstituted as a necessary sacrifice, a hero's burden. The dream's paradox unfolds: I am both perpetrator and redeemer, architect of chaos and its unlikely savior. The justifications crystallize into a new reality, a dark mirror held up to my soul that I cannot look away from. My hands, now stained indelibly, glow faintly in the dream's pallid light. This is the dream's cruel truth: when you cross that line, the story becomes yours to rationalize, and the lake's waters will always reflect your rewritten past.
