I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a lush courtyard, half-draped in the glow of a setting sun. The horizon glimmers in turquoise and rose gold, every cloud tinted with hints of fire as day begins to melt into early evening. Marble columns circle the courtyard, crowned with twisting vines of lavender wisteria whose fragrance hangs heavily in the still, humid air. At the center of it all stands an ancient fountain carved to look like serpents coiled around each other, trickling water that sounds simultaneously soothing and ominous.

Across from you is the person whose counsel you typically hold in highest regard—someone you’ve always trusted. Tonight, however, something between you is fractured. The tension crackles in the air. Their usually warm expression is set hard, eyes casting shadows of disappointment. Despite the hush of the courtyard, you can sense a gathering storm—not in the sky, but in the impossibility brewing between the two of you.

You step toward them, unsure if the rasp in your voice is from the dream’s magic or from your own hesitation. Your disagreement is torn between logic and emotion—both of you certain of your stance, yet unwilling to yield an inch. False sightings of acceptance flash across your companion’s face, quickly replaced by the silent rebuke in their steady, steeled gaze.

Suddenly, the vines that drape the marble pillars begin to move—like ivy made serpentine, gliding around the columns and slithering closer to where you both stand. The air grows heavier, pressing in on your lungs and making each breath hard-earned. The courtyard feels alive: the wisteria blossoms gently quiver, showering you with purple petals that land between your feet. Each petal’s drop seems to pulsate, as though the flowers, too, are reacting to the friction between you and your companion.

The other person speaks in a voice resonant with sorrow and resolve. They point toward the serpents in the fountain, symbols of power and transformation, coiled in endless tension. A pang of recognition stabs your chest. You realize that, just like these marble beasts, you and your companion have become locked in a stance neither of you can easily break. The water flowing between the serpents glints with an iridescent sheen, reflecting how tightly wound you both are.

Though every nerve in your body begs for you to maintain your pride, you shut your eyes, take a trembling breath, and let the swirl of the dream unfold. You decide to dip your hands into the fountain, feeling the cool water swirl around your fingers. A sensation like gentle electricity ripples through your arms as you lift a handful of the glittering liquid. By some unspoken agreement, your companion does the same, letting the water drip slowly from their cupped palms.

“What are we truly disagreeing about?” you ask softly. Instead of answering, they tilt their head, letting you see a glimmer of doubt beneath the hard façade. Night has begun to slip into the courtyard, intensifying the strange glow of the fountain’s waters. The serpents’ eyes appear to flicker, as though they are urging you to move, to change.

A gust of wind stirs the wisteria vines, and petals swirl in a soft vortex around the two of you. Caught in the swirl, you step closer—heart beating faster, adrenaline mingling with hope. As you reach out, your hand meets your companion’s in the space between you. Water droplets, shimmering with color, cling to both your fingertips. In that moment, a subtle accord forms. The courtyard’s tension eases just enough for the air to grow lighter, as though the dream itself is sighing with relief.

While the disagreement isn’t magically resolved, you both sense a thaw in the ice. Drops of water trace luminous trails down your wrists, carrying your renewed intention to listen, to soften, to untangle. At the edge of your hearing, you can sense the hum of music drifting on the night air—gentle strings, or perhaps the resonant chords of a harp.  

And so you remain there, hand in hand, inhaling the floral perfume of twilight. You still feel the simmering uncertainty, but wrapped around you is the serene promise that despite the cracks, you can find a path right through them. The vines settle back onto the pillars, the serpents in the fountain go inert again, and the last blush of sunset fades from turquoise to a deep, comforting violet. As the dream fades, you hold onto a sliver of peace, determined to bridge the chasm between you and the one whose presence has always mattered.
