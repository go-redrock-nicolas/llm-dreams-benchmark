I am dreaming. I wake up to discover that the world has undergone a drastic transformation overnight. The rules of society have completely changed, turning everything I once knew on its head. What was once considered normal and acceptable is now strictly forbidden.

As I step outside my home, I am hit with a sense of unease. The air is thick with tension, and the streets are eerily quiet. The once bustling city has become a ghost town overnight. The buildings are adorned with bright, fluorescent signs that read 'illegal' and 'forbidden' in bold letters.

As I begin to navigate the new cityscape, I notice that all forms of communication have been banned. The once ubiquitous sounds of phones ringing and conversations floating in the air are now silent. People communicate through handwritten notes, whispering, or using sign language.

The change is not just limited to communication, but extends to every aspect of life. Public spaces that were once open for all are now restricted to specific groups. The parks, once teeming with families and children, are now cordoned off for the exclusive use of wealthy elites.

The air is thick with fear and uncertainty. Everyone is on edge, unsure of what the future holds. As I walk through the streets, I see people hiding behind their masks, trying to blend in with the crowd. No one knows who to trust anymore.

Despite the bleakness of the situation, there is an undercurrent of resistance. Small pockets of people gather in hidden alleys and darkness, plotting their rebellion against the new order. They exchange ideas, weapons, and hope.

I realize that I too must choose a side, but the choice seems impossible. The old world was flawed, but this new order feels wrong. I don't belong in either of these worlds.

Suddenly, a bright light flashes in the sky, illuminating the city. A strange pulsing sound echoes through the streets. People begin to panic, running in all directions. In the chaos, I lose sight of the resistance group.

I wake up in a cold sweat, my heart racing. The dream is over, but the feeling of unease lingers. As I try to piece together the fragments of my dream, I realize that the world is changing rapidly, and we must be prepared to adapt or resist.
