I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The moment your eyelids close, a peculiar, chrysalis-blue twilight washes over everything, and you find yourself standing on a mezzanine of slick obsidian that zigzags through an endless atrium. Shimmering constellations drift beneath your feet instead of above your head, as though the universe itself has slipped its jacket inside-out.  

Far below, on a balcony that alternates between marble and cloud, stands someone you cherish—part friend, part sibling, part patchwork of every person who has ever mattered to you. They wear a cloak sewn from half-finished promises and hold a lantern whose flame is a skittish hummingbird made of embers. At each heartbeat, they pluck a glowing feather from the bird and fling it over the railing. The feathers drift down like lazy comets, leaving ash-ribbon contrails that stain the air. You know—because dream logic whispers it directly into your bones—that every feather is another risky choice: a neglected appointment, an untreated wound, a late-night phone call ignored.  

You call their name. Your voice arrives in the shape of origami swans that unfold into sentences mid-flight. But as soon as the paper birds reach them, they flatten, bargain with gravity, and tumble into nothing. Your loved one doesn’t even glance up. They hum a tune you once sang together—now warped into a minor key that pricks your heart like cold pins.

You decide to go to them. The staircase twists away beneath your first step, becoming a Möbius strip of slippery moonstone. You slide instead of walk, spiraling through corridors that mutate faster than thought: a hallway of grandfather clocks whose pendulums swing like machetes; a greenhouse where glass roses exhale storms; a library whose books are blank until you open them, each page reflecting your doubts in mirrored ink.  

At last, you stumble upon a door made of whispered secrets. It opens not with a push, but with acceptance. You step onto the balcony beside your cherished one. Up close, you see fatigue in the set of their shoulders, frantic determination in the twitch of their fingers. The lantern-hummingbird flutters more weakly now, feathers smoldering at the tips.

You reach out—gentle, palms skyward, no demands, only invitation. The dream slows. Sound drains away until the hush feels oceanic. In that silence, you sense the enormous gravity of choice: you cannot pry the dangerous feathers from their grasp without extinguishing the last sliver of their autonomy.  

So you breathe in resolve, exhale compassion, and shift tactics. You open your own chest—dreams are obliging—and reveal a heartbeat that glows like a small sunrise. From it sprouts a seed of calm, rooted in unconditional presence. You plant this seed on the balcony’s stone. It grows instantly into a low, luminescent tree whose leaves play wind-chime harmonies of patience. Beneath its branches you sit, leaving a space beside you. No pleading. No judgment. Only a quiet beacon saying, “I’m here when you want shade from the fire.”

For a time the loved one continues plucking feathers. Yet their rhythm falters; they tilt an ear toward the soft leaf-music. One trembling hand lowers. The hummingbird’s flame steadies, the ash in the air thins, and a single intact feather drifts not downward but sideways—landing gently in your lap.

You look up. Their eyes meet yours at last: wary, weary, but bright with the reflection of your little tree’s light. They haven’t asked for your perspective, but now, maybe, they are ready to share the silence with you.

The dream winds backward like tape in an old projector. The balcony folds into mist, lantern sputters into a firefly, mezzanine dissolves into night water. You wake with the memory of warm feather-light against your palms and the understanding that sometimes the most potent intervention is presence, patience, and an invitation that never closes.
