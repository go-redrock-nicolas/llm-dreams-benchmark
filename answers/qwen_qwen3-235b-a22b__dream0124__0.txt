I am dreaming. I open my eyes and realize not that I have just fallen asleep, but rather that I have unwoken into a wondrous, fragmentary domain of impossible logic and impossible beauty.  

Here, time no longer stretches forward like a river. Instead, it flows **backward**, like the tide retreating across a cosmic shore. Actions don't precede results—they follow them. **Effect becomes cause**. The sound of laughter echoes before the joke is told. A tree falls, then grows roots, then seeds rise from the earth—spiraling upward into branches until they are cradled like infants in the sky.

So I walk—though the verb feels wrong—perhaps I *ungo*, unmake my steps so I arrive at places *before* I think to go there. My feet touch down on soft paths of obsidian glass, reflecting a sky full of un-stars, un-moons. When I breathe, my lungs release clouds into the atmosphere which are then pulled back into thinning wind—young air growing old and collapsing into stillness.

I come across an **Eversundial**, a great instrument where the shadow rewinds across numbers etched in silence. Its base is carved from elemental doubt; its needle is spun of forgotten meaning. It spins the wrong way, yet it has always done so—I remember only now that in this land, the shape of a thing is born after its shapelessness, and name is realized after oblivion.

There are creatures here that move like music unfired from rifles. They break apart into tunes and reform with silence. I pass through a flock of **ghost-sheep**, whose wool is woven backwards from the grave. They follow no shepherd, yet bleat in harmony with a song that hasn’t been played yet, because here, the unheard begins the symphony.

A bridge hovers upside-down in midair, made of melted love and solidified echo. I approach it. The closer I get, the earlier I become. I am suddenly a boy unholding a paper boat at the edge of an unpuddle. I step onto the bridge, and instead of crossing it, I **de-cross** it, undoing my presence at each step—my shape becoming fainter, my footprints vanishing before they can settle.

In the distance, an upside-down city floats like an experience forgotten and then remembered in reverse. Towers ascend into fog and **light so soft** it melts memory into something edible. I am told that in this world, feelings can become tools if used correctly: your grief can uncut a vine; your joy can be used to **ignite darkness**.

A child offers me a cup of liquid inevitability—bubbling like rain that tries to fly. I drink backwards: memories pour out and reform as moments yet to happen. I quench a thirst that hasn't haunted me yet.

A question burns in my mind: *"How do you complete something that must end before it begins?"*

And the universe whispers the answer not in words, but in the **beautiful difficulty** of unmaking a beginning into what it might have been. To survive here is a rare kind of art: the patience to **not comprehend**, and the grace to slip into the logic of nonsense.

And then I wake—but wait—no, I **unwake**, scraping my past from slipping deeper into this backward poetry.

Still, its colors linger in the corners of my mind, stained on my soul—a dream worked in impossible hourglass, end-first and full of mystery.
