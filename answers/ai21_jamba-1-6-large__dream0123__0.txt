I am dreaming. You’re standing on the edge of a vast, smoldering cityscape, the air thick with acrid smoke and the distant wails of sirens. The skyline is fractured—some buildings reduced to rubble, others leaning precariously like broken teeth. Above, the sky churns in unnatural hues, a swirling maelstrom of purples and grays that feels alive, predatory even. The ground beneath your feet trembles intermittently, as if the earth itself is trying to shake off the human chaos above. 

You are not alone. All around you, figures in tattered clothing shuffle past, their faces masks of exhaustion and despair. They carry bundles of belongings, children, or nothing at all. The air reverberates with a cacophony of cries—some pleading, some cursing, and others too broken to form words. Yet, amidst the chaos, there’s an eerie undercurrent of silence, as though the very world is holding its breath, waiting for something worse to come. 

You turn and find yourself at the center of a makeshift command center. Around you, a team of grim-faced responders works frantically, their movements mechanical, their eyes darting between screens and maps that seem to offer no answers, only more questions. The radios crackle with frantic voices, each one vying for attention, for salvation. The room stinks of sweat, burned electronics, and something sharper, something that smells like fear. 

A voice cuts through the noise. It’s one of your deputies, her face pale, her hands trembling as she holds up a tablet. The screen shows a live feed of a dam, miles away, straining against the weight of the floodwaters behind it. The concrete is cracked, water gushing through in torrents. The numbers on the screen are stark: hours, maybe less, until it collapses. The implications are catastrophic: entire towns downstream, thousands of lives. 

But it’s not just the dam. Another screen shows the firelines of a massive wildfire, consuming everything in its path, closing in on populated areas. Overhead, weather reports predict an unprecedented storm, one that could bring hurricane-force winds and torrential rain, compounding every disaster at once. Resources are stretched impossibly thin—there aren’t enough people, supplies, or time to address even one of these crises fully, let alone all of them simultaneously. You feel the crushing weight of responsibility settle on your shoulders like a physical thing, threatening to snap you in half. 

And then, as if on cue, the political leaders arrive. They stride in, flanked by aides and security, their faces grim but somehow detached, as though this were a stage rather than a living nightmare. Their demands are contradictory: save this, protect that, prioritize the economy, think of the optics. One insists on diverting resources to a wealthy district, another demands evacuation routes that simply don’t exist. Their voices rise, drowning out the responders, drowning out reason itself. 

You try to speak, to cut through the noise and impose some order, but your voice dies in your throat. The harder you try, the more the words slip away, replaced by an overwhelming sense of futility. Your team looks to you, their desperation plain, but the answers they need aren’t there. Instead, there’s only the growing realization that no matter what you do, it won’t be enough. 

The earth shakes again, harder this time. Someone screams. The ceiling of the command center buckles, dust raining down as someone yells to evacuate. Outside, the storm breaks, the roar of the wind mingling with the crash of debris and the relentless roar of the floodwaters. You try to move, to act, but your feet are rooted to the spot. The dream seems to stretch, elongating time itself, every moment filled with the unbearable tension of knowing that the worst is yet to come. 

And then, with a sickening lurch, you feel the dream collapsing in on itself, reality fragmenting. You’re falling, or maybe the world is falling around you. The city, the people, the chaos—all of it dissolves into a whirlpool of color and sound. Somewhere, impossibly far away, a child’s laugh echoes, piercing and pure, but it’s swallowed by the void. 

You wake up. 

For a moment, the relief is overpowering, the simple act of breathing a luxury. But then, as the fragments of the dream cling to your mind like cobwebs, you realize something unsettling: the emotions, the fear, the sense of helplessness—they linger. It wasn’t just a dream, you realize. It was a rehearsal. 

And somewhere, out there in the waking world, the storm is coming.
