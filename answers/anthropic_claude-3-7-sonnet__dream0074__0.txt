I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the edge of a city unlike any I've known, where towering structures twist like frozen dance movements, their surfaces shifting between translucent crystal and living moss. The air carries whispers of cinnamon and electricity. My hands—once deft with keyboards and analytical thought—feel strangely hollow, as though my skills have been gently extracted while I slept.

In this world, nobody processes information or communicates as I once did. Instead, people connect through chromatic resonance—sending ripples of emotion-laden colors through the air that others absorb through their fingertips. My attempts to speak fall flat, my words dissipating like smoke before reaching anyone's ears.

Wandering through markets where merchants exchange memories instead of currency, I watch helplessly as my former expertise evaporates into irrelevance. What use is my analytical mind when thoughts here are exchanged through the patterned beating of butterfly wings cultivated behind each person's ear?

Desperate to belong, I find myself drawn to an ancient library—though "library" fails to capture the living repository of collective consciousness housed within a massive, breathing baobab tree. The keeper, an elderly woman with eyes that reflect different landscapes depending on how the light hits them, gestures me closer.

"Your old world is gone," she says, her voice somehow reaching me when others couldn't. "But you carry something we lack—the perspective of the stranger."

She teaches me to translate the color-emotions of this world into patterns I can understand, while I learn to offer my unique viewpoint—the outsider who sees connections they've grown blind to. I become a bridge-builder, an interpreter of lost contexts, weaving my analytical thinking into their intuitive knowing.

As seasons change—each marked by different constellations that descend to dance along the horizon—I gradually establish myself not despite my foreignness, but because of it, creating a new identity from the remnants of who I was and glimpses of who I might become.
