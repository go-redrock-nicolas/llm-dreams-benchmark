I am dreaming. …stagger backward into a place that cannot possibly exist: a moon-lit orchard floating in the middle of a night-colored sea. Dark water laps at invisible shores beneath the trees, each trunk shimmering with silver bark. Crimson lanterns sway from the branches in a wind you cannot feel, casting a ruby glow across fruit as large as hearts and just as warm. Every footstep sounds like distant thunder, yet the ground is soft as quilted velvet.

“How long did you know?” a voice asks behind you.

You spin and find your confidant—your oldest friend, the keeper of your secrets—perched on the lowest branch of a pearlescent apple tree. Their eyes glimmer like twin mirrors, reflecting every moment you ever trusted them, every joke, every promise. But now their smile is frayed at the edges, stitched together with threads of counterfeit gold.

“I never meant to hurt you,” they say, though the sound is oddly hollow, as if spoken through a seashell. The words scatter in the air like a swarm of fireflies, each tiny light a half-truth freed from its cage.

Fury surges up your spine in molten ribbons. The orchard tilts, the red lanterns swing, and suddenly each fruit bursts open, revealing watch faces instead of seeds. Clock hands whirl madly, time hemorrhaging out of them in glittering spirals. The revelation strikes: every conversation, every reassuring nod, every vow from your friend was a gear in this ticking machinery of deception.

You reach for one of the floating clocks, but it dissolves before you can grasp it, leaving only prickling stardust on your fingertips. You wipe the dust on your sleeves, and where it touches, fabric turns to charcoal and drifts away—parts of your trust turning to ash in real time.

Your friend hops down from the branch. Where their feet touch the grass, the ground calcifies into frozen glass. You see your own reflection beneath their shoes, cracked into kaleidoscope shards—fragments of who you thought you were when you believed them.

“What do you want?” you whisper, your voice trembling like a violin string drawn too tight.

They open their mouth, but instead of words, a single raven emerges, sleek and silent, its wings painted with night. It circles you once, twice, its feathers carving lines of ink in the air that spell out hidden sentences: I took your trust because I feared losing your love.

A breeze of understanding—or perhaps resignation—blows through the orchard. The silver trunks bend and sigh, and the lanterns dim to rose-colored moonlets. You inhale, tasting saltwater and apple blossom on the same breath. Yes, the deception cut deep, but the person before you is still the same soul you once cherished—only their chosen mask has shattered.

You gather the inked sentences floating around you, shaping them into a quill. Holding it to your chest, you feel it pulse like a second heartbeat. The raven lands upon your shoulder, surprisingly weightless. Its eyes are galaxies, vast and unblinking.

With slow determination, you draw a line in the air between you and your friend. At first it shimmers, a borderline of soft gold, protective yet permeable. You speak a quiet incantation—not of forgiveness, not yet, but of boundaries. The line thickens into a living ribbon of light. Your friend nods, tears forming like dew on their lashes, and the tears fall to the glassy ground. Each droplet sprouts into a new sapling, branches bristling with unopened buds—possibilities for truth that might one day bloom.

The sea surrounding the orchard begins to rise, transforming into a staircase of mirrored waves. The raven lifts off, guiding you upward, feathered wings beating steady drumbeats of courage. You ascend step by shimmering step—leaving behind the orchard, the cracked reflections, the clocks bleeding lost hours—and climb toward a horizon the color of dawn-lit amethyst.

Just before waking, you glance back. Your friend stands among the young trees, lantern light glowing warmly across their face. They place a hand over their heart and bow—an unspoken admission, a hope for renewal. You nod once, neither accepting nor rejecting, but simply acknowledging the path ahead. Then you turn, letting the raven’s wings fan open a gateway of violet light.

The dream dissolves into a hush of feathers and sunrise, and you carry with you a single truth: trust, once broken, can be rebuilt only with bricks of candor, set in mortar made of time.
