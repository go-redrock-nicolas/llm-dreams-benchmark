I am dreaming.

The world around me wavers, as if reality is painted in watercolor and each new anxious thought ripples the canvas. I find myself standing in a cavernous auditorium, the seats before me fading away into the purple hush of twilight, their occupants indistinct shadows flickering with anticipation.

My heart pounds—a rolling thunder echoing through my chest. I feel my palms, slick with fear, clutching ghostly notecards. Each one seems to melt, the ink bleeding, words running off the page, unreadable and mocking. My thoughts twist tighter; a vine of worry wraps around my ribs, squeezing until confidence can barely bloom.

High overhead, the stage lights sizzle and pop, sending down a cascade of golden dust. In that shimmering haze, the shadows in the seats lean forward, mouths wide with silent judgment, eyes gleaming like lanterns in the dark. Their gaze burns hotter with every missed breath.

Suddenly, the floor beneath me shifts—a patchwork of glass panels, each one filled with swirling images. Childhood stumbles. Stifled laughter in school halls at a silly mistake. The word “failure” spelled in letters made of stone, heavy and sharp. My reflection appears in one pane, distorted and anxious; I see all the old doubts collected in my eyes.

The weight of the moment presses down. I remember every time I froze, every fumbled line, every sting of embarrassment. The whispers start: “You’ll forget your words. You’ll be exposed. You’re not prepared.” They slither like smoke from the audience, tongue-tied serpents winding around my legs.

But as the anxiety swells, closing in like a storm tide, something elemental stirs within me. From the midst of my chest rises a sudden, silent roar—a defiance growing brighter than the lights above. I feel the glass panels beneath my feet begin to glow, each regret and fear kindling into luminescent stepping stones. The floor steadies, and instead of slipping, I am walking forward on a radiant path made from every lesson of the past.

The shadowy crowd shifts. Their features sharpen into faces I recognize—mentors, friends, even past versions of myself. Their eyes soften, mouths gentle, and I sense a current of wordless encouragement drifting through the space. The swirling storm of intrusive thoughts begins to unravel, thread by thread, replaced by an airy sense of possibility.

With each step, my voice grows surer—even before I speak. My hands steady. The stage around me is still enormous, but no longer threatening. Now it stretches into a horizon painted with opportunity, and I am no longer a trembling figure, but a voyager, setting sail across a sea of my own making.

I inhale. The words I need appear before me in radiant script—a constellation guiding the next chapter—not just of the dream, but of who I can become.
