I am dreaming. I am in a place where my past self can meet my present self and my future self.  I am surrounded by people who have gone through similar experiences as mine.  They are welcoming me into their group, their family, their tribe.
As they introduce themselves to me, I realize that they are not just people but also symbols and archetypes.  There is the Warrior who fought against the oppressors and defeated them.  There is the Healer who used her skills to repair the damage caused by the abuses.  There is the Teacher who shared her knowledge with others so they can learn from her mistakes.  There is the Lover who showed me what true intimacy means.
They tell me about their stories, their struggles, their successes.  They show me how they transformed themselves mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually.  They invite me to join them in their quests, their adventures, their explorations.
I ask them why they decided to help others like me.  They say it's because they want to make the world a better place for everyone.  They say it's because they don't want anyone else to suffer as they did.  They say it's because they care about me and themselves too much not to do something about it.
I tell them that I've been searching for them my whole life but never found them until now when I'm ready to accept who I am and what I can become.  I show them how hungry I am for knowledge, for wisdom, for love.
We all agree that this is just the beginning of our journey together as one united team dedicated to making change happen for good forevermore amen
