I am dreaming. …I sense their embrace as a warm glow beneath my skin, a silent communication of understanding and solidarity. The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and sweet pine needles. Lanterns—woven from translucent leaves—hang all around, casting mosaics of green and gold on the ground where we gather in a ring. Their faces are gentle, weathered with both pain and courage, each pair of eyes reflecting a quiet, steady light.

A woman named Maris, her silver hair braided with wildflowers, takes my hand and leads me to the circle’s center. "Here," she says, her voice soft yet unyielding, "we heal by seeing." By firelight, they tell their stories—not as scars, but as sacred maps, lines guiding the way from darkness to sanctuary.

Tonight, they ask me only to listen, to dip my fingertips into a bowl of cool river clay and, with eyes closed, shape the story inside me. The clay wobbles in my hands, memories trembling to rise. As I press and mold, a strange figure emerges—half-bird, half-child—its wings spread wide in yearning.

In this dream, they ask no explanations, nor sympathy. Instead, they lay their sculptures beside mine—a hundred odd creatures, trembling or roaring, each one peculiar and beloved. Together, these forms create a sprawling circle of resilience. An impromptu chorus rises: there is humming, laughter—someone plays a small wooden flute. The sound floats up, spiraling into the branches where it becomes fireflies.

As I breathe in the music and light, warmth seeps into the hollow places within me. The realization blooms: in this circle, healing is not solitude, but shared vulnerability; not erasure of pain, but the forging of beauty from it. My heart feels lighter, anchored not by my old sorrow, but by this living tapestry of kinship—a knowing that whatever darkness we touch, we forge new shapes together, surprising and shining in the lantern light.
