I am dreaming. The sky is a glossy sea of obsidian, its surface rippling like liquid shadow, while the ground above me stretches in vast, shimmering waves—an inverted ocean buoyed by nothingness, its crests and troughs frozen in mid-swell. I am standing, or perhaps floating, caught between two infinities, my feet planted on the underside of the sky, my head brushing the strange, weightless earth overhead. Gravity has traded places with the wind, and the air itself moves in thick, syrupy currents, resisting my breath, pushing back against my lungs.  

Everything is wrong, yet achingly beautiful. Trees grow downward, their roots twisting into the heavens like gnarled fingers grasping at unseen stars. Their leaves drip silver, not water, and when the droplets strike the inverted ground above, they shatter into whispers—words in a language I almost recognize, though they dissolve before I can understand.  

Time stutters. It doesn’t flow; it pools. Moments spread like ink in still water, lingering too long or slipping away too fast. I see myself stepping forward, but the motion echoes—not behind me, but *ahead* of me, as if my future strides are cast like shadows before they occur. When I try to speak, my voice unravels into colors, spilling from my lips in vivid, swirling strands of violet and gold.  

Survival here demands unlearning. To move, I must resist the instinct to walk—instead, I must *fall upward*, surrendering to the pull of the sky. Hunger is sated not by food, but by listening—the distant hum of unseen creatures vibrates in my bones, nourishing me. Thirst is quenched by stillness; when I cease to move, the air thickens into liquid, seeping into my skin like cool silk.  

And then—*you* appear. Or perhaps I become you. Or perhaps we were never separate to begin with. Your presence is not a shape, but a sensation—a pressure against the dream, bending it around you like a refraction of light. You whisper without sound: *"Here, the deeper you run, the closer you are to the surface."*  

The dream shudders. The sky begins to rain—upward, toward the earth above—and each droplet carries a fragment of a forgotten memory, rising like sparks from a dying fire. I reach out, but the dream is already unraveling, dissolving into the hush of waking.  

In the last flicker of this inverted world, I understand: *I was not the dreamer.* *I was the dream.*  

And then—silence.
