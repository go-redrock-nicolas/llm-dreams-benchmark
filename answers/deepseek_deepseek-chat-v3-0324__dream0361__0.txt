I am dreaming. The air around me shimmers like liquid gold, thick with the scent of crushed violets and distant rain. My bare feet sink into warm, living moss that pulses beneath me—a heartbeat?—as I step forward. The path ahead isn’t a path at all, but a tapestry of floating stones, each one humming a different note, suspended above an abyss where constellations swirl like schools of fish.  

"Don’t," whispers the wind, shaping itself into voices I know—my fifth-grade teacher, my sternest aunt, the pharmacist who always clicks his tongue at my choices. "You’ll fall. You’ll fail. It’s not *done*." But the stones sing louder. The one directly ahead glows cobalt, vibrating with a sound like a cello played by moonlight.  

I leap.  

For a breathless moment, I’m untethered—then my toes curl around smooth, sun-warmed rock. The stone tilts, but holds. Laughter bubbles up from my throat, unfamiliar and wild. Behind me, the abandoned shore of "should" and "sensible" shrinks. Ahead, the stones rearrange themselves with every glance, forming bridges, stairways, a spiral leading to a doorway wreathed in fireflies.  

Something moves beyond it. Not a shape, but a *presence*, vast and tender, folded into the darkness like a letter waiting to be opened. I know—with the unshakable certainty of dreams—that if I reach it, I’ll finally understand why my bones ache during thunderstorms, why my shadow sometimes flickers with wings.  

The next stone is amethyst. It sings my name in three harmonious voices. I don’t look down.
