I am dreaming. As I stand atop a cliff, the sea crashing against the jagged edge below, I am suddenly bathed in an otherworldly light. Words come alive, words like discomfort and unease and self-doubt.
They encircle me, a vortex of judgment and disapproval, each one a slash, a lance pushed deep into my very being.
