I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The moment you step into this inverted world, your senses unravel like threads in a storm. The ground beneath your feet is not solid but a shimmering membrane of liquid glass, reflecting a sky that churns *below* you, alive with constellations that pulse like bioluminescent jellyfish. Above, where the earth should be, hangs an endless expanse of molten gold—a ceiling of inverted geology, dripping stalactites of obsidian that hum with the whispers of forgotten gods. You breathe, but the air tastes of iron and violets, and each inhale tightens your lungs as though drawing smoke from a dying star.  

Here, gravity is a suggestion, not a law. You float upward when you think of sorrow, anchored only by joy. To move forward, you must *unthink* your destination, willing your body to drift backward into the space you wish to occupy. Time, too, is a spiral. You glimpse your childhood self flickering in the distance, chasing a kite made of shadows, while your future looms behind you—a figure cloaked in moth-winged silence, always just out of reach.  

Survival demands surrender to paradox. The trees here grow roots skyward, siphoning memories from the atmosphere. Their leaves are shards of mirrored ice, reflecting not your face but your *essence*: a flicker of your deepest fear, your most secret hunger. To eat, you must fast; to drink, you must thirst. A river flows nearby, but its water exists only as vapor. To drink, you inhale the mist and feel your veins fill with liquid starlight, your bones hollowing into flutes that sing when the wind passes through.  

Creatures prowl this realm—beasts stitched from the fabric of logic turned inside-out. A herd of *backward stags* gallops sideways through time, their antlers blooming with withered flowers that bloom anew as they vanish. A serpent made of its own venom coils around a spire of floating salt, whispering riddles in the language of your mother’s heartbeat. To pass, you must answer its question: *“What is the weight of a shadow when the sun mourns?”* You reply not with words but by offering your own silhouette, torn from your body and handed over like a coin. The serpent swallows it greedily, and the ground solidifies beneath you—for a moment.  

The greatest threat, though, is the *Unknitting*. At irregular intervals, the world forgets its own rules. Colors dissolve into sounds, and sounds crystallize into thorns. The sky might suddenly invert, plunging you into the void of its former underbelly. To survive, you learn to weave your thoughts into anchors: a melody hummed to stabilize the air, a scar drawn in light across your palm to remind the blood how to flow.  

At the heart of this chaos stands the *Obelisk of Mirrors*, a tower that is not a tower but the absence of all towers. To touch it, you must become a question. You press your hand to its surface and see not your reflection but a thousand *unlived lives*: a version of yourself who drowned in the liquid sky, one who wears the molten ceiling as a crown, another who speaks to the serpent in its own tongue and becomes its sister. The Obelisk demands a sacrifice—not of flesh, but of certainty. You relinquish your belief in beginnings and endings, and in return, it gifts you a seed that hums with the memory of *upright worlds*.  

When you finally wake, the taste of iron and violets lingers. Your palms are etched with constellations, and for a heartbeat, the ceiling of your room ripples like liquid gold. You wonder which world is the dream—and whether the laws you once trusted were ever true, or just the gentlest lie your mind could bear.
