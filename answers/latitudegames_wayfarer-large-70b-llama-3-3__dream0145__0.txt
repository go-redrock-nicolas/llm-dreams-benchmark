I am dreaming. I wake up to find myself transported to a world of unrelenting darkness and suffocating mist. The ground beneath my feet is slick with moisture, and I can hear the faint echoes of distant screams carried on an otherworldly breeze. Each step I take feels like a betrayal, as if the earth itself is conspiring against me.

A faint light glows in the distance - a beacon of hope in this desolate landscape. I begin to make my way towards it, my hands outstretched and my heart pounding fiercely. Every step forward is a battle, as the mist thickens around me, clawing at my skin with ethereal talons.

As I draw closer to the light, I realize it's coming from a massive stone structure rising up from the ground. Ancient runes are carved into its walls, pulsing with an eerie energy that sets my teeth on edge. The screams seem to be coming from behind these walls, and I can make out words being chanted in a language I don't understand.

With trembling hands, I reach out to touch the stone. As soon as my fingers make contact, the entire structure shifts and groans, revealing a narrow opening. I hesitate for a moment, my body heavy with dread, but something compels me forward.

I step through the doorway and find myself in a vast chamber bathed in an eerie green light. The room is dominated by a massive egg - larger than a house - that throbs with an inner light. Around its base are countless withered bodies, their hands reaching towards the egg as if in supplication.

A low, rhythmic hum fills the air, and the bodies suddenly twitch and rise. They form a circle around the egg, their hollow eyes fixed upon me. In a voice that shakes the very foundations of the chamber, they speak:

"Who dares to disturb the ancient ones? What offering do you bring?"

I stand frozen in terror, unable to form words, as tendrils of energy begin to seep from the egg and snare me. The last thing I see is a hatch opening to reveal an eye of pure malevolence before I awaken with a strangled gasp, drenched in sweat but grateful for the safety of my own bed.
