I am dreaming. You’re standing in a ballroom suspended between the earth and the stars, its vaulted ceiling a swirling nebula of indigo and molten gold. The air hums with the weight of a thousand whispers, each voice polished to a mirror sheen, repeating the same phrase in unison: *“Grace. Poise. Silence.”* You wear a mask of porcelain, painted to mimic a serene, perfect face—one you don’t recognize. Beneath it, your skin itches, alive with the urge to scream, to rip the mask off and let your bones crack into something true. But the crowd around you is a sea of identical masks—swans, foxes, roses—all flawless, all hollow—and they glide in a waltz so precise it feels rehearsed by gods. You move with them, your feet aching, your spine rigid as a marionette’s, but your hands tremble. They want to claw at the gilded walls, to tear through the velvet curtains that frame this lie.  

Then you see the door.  
It’s crooked, half-hidden behind a tapestry of thorns and fireflies, its wood gnarled and pulsing like a heartbeat. No one else looks at it. No one else *sees* it. You slip away, the crowd’s synchronized laughter dissolving into a low, static hiss. The door handle is cold iron, and when you turn it, the ballroom shatters like glass.  

You fall.  

Into a forest of clocks. Trees with gears for leaves tick in dissonant rhythms, their branches clawing at a sky stitched with frayed thread. The ground is a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a different version of you: a child with ink-stained fingers, a warrior with a sword of smoke, a lover weeping molten silver. You kneel, desperate to touch them, but the shards cut you, drawing blood that pools into words—*“Not enough. Too much. Wrong.”* Above, a moon made of teeth grins down, and the wind smells of burnt paper and forgotten names.  

A figure emerges, faceless but familiar, holding a key forged from a rib bone. *“Choose,”* it says, its voice the sound of roots splitting stone. *“Stay fractured, or burn.”* The key glints, and suddenly you’re back in the ballroom, the mask suffocating you, the crowd’s chant a vise around your skull. But now you feel it—the mask’s edges, its fragility. Your fingers brush the seam, and the dream convulses.  

You rip the mask off.  

Beneath it, your face is not a face at all but a storm—a cyclone of ink and lightning, your eyes twin supernovae. The crowd screams, their masks cracking like eggshells to reveal ravenous mouths and empty sockets. The ballroom melts, walls dissolving into a river of black honey, and you’re swimming through it, your body unraveling into smoke and starlight. You hear your name, not as a label, but as a wild animal howling in the dark—raw, untranslatable, *alive*.  

The forest of clocks swallows you whole. You plant yourself in the soil, roots spearing through your ribs, and bloom into a tree with bark like scar tissue and flowers that sing in your mother’s lost lullaby. The faceless figure knots itself around you, becoming a vine, a shadow, a second skin. You are both the arsonist and the flame.  

When you wake, your cheeks are wet, your hands smell of sap and ash, and the taste of ink lingers on your tongue. Somewhere, deep in your bones, thunder rumbles—a reminder that you are never just one thing. You are the waltz and the wound, the mask and the face beneath it, the fire that burns the script and the hand that writes it anew.
