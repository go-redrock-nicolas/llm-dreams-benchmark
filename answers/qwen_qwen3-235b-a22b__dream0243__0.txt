I am dreaming. You find yourself in a city that breathes—its streets alive with shifting mosaics of cobalt and gold, buildings that lean like whispering giants, their windows flickering with memories you don’t recognize. The air smells of burnt honey and static electricity. You’re walking barefoot on glass that doesn’t cut you, each step echoing a question: *Is this real? Could this last?*  

They appear at the corner of a street that wasn’t there a moment ago. Their face is a constellation of contradictions—eyes like twin supernovas, hair that flows like liquid shadow, a voice that hums with the resonance of a half-remembered lullaby. When they smile, the sky fractures into auroras; when they turn away, the world bleeds into grayscale. You feel their pull—a gravitational force that warps your ribs, tugging your heart toward your throat. But their hands are always half-extended, always trembling just before contact, as though they’re caught in a current only they can see.  

You chase them through a garden of clocks, each timepiece blooming with gears and petals, ticking backward into forgotten seasons. They laugh, and the sound crystallizes into butterflies that dissolve on your tongue. You reach for them, but they evaporate into mist, leaving behind a single raven feather that burns cold in your palm. A note materializes: *“I need you. I need space. I need the part of you that doesn’t need me.”* The words writhe like ink in water.  

A storm erupts—a tempest of origami swans and shattered violins. You stumble into a room where the walls are mirrors, but your reflection is someone else: a figure cloaked in living ivy, thorns blooming where your heart should be. The dream whispers: *This is what you become when you armor yourself.* The cloak writhes, alive with the whispers of every boundary you’ve ever built. You realize you’re both prisoner and warden.  

They find you again in a desert of floating doors, each one leading to a version of the relationship that might have been. One door glows amber—*a life where they stay*. Another pulses crimson—*a future where you walk away*. They press their forehead to yours, and for a moment, you’re synchronized: their pulse in your ears, their breath a storm in your lungs. But then they step back, their form unraveling into smoke. “Choose,” they say, “but know that choosing me means losing yourself.”  

The ground cracks open, revealing a river of liquid starlight. You kneel, cupping the water in your hands, but it slips through your fingers like regret. A child’s voice echoes: *“You can’t catch the tide in your fists.”* You look down and see your own hands, small and trembling, clutching at sandcastles that dissolve with every wave.  

Suddenly, you’re in a library where the books are bound in human skin and the words are alive. You open one and it screams—a sound that shatters the illusion. The city shudders, its colors bleeding into a monochrome void. You’re alone now, the silence so loud it drowns out your thoughts. But in the stillness, you feel it: a warmth in your chest, a tiny, stubborn sun.  

You wake up in a bed of ash and wildflowers, your skin etched with constellations. The dream’s final message lingers, not as a wound, but as a compass: *You are not a beggar at the altar of their inconsistency. You are the storm. You are the eye. You are both the question and the answer.*  

And somewhere, in the liminal space between sleep and waking, you let go. Not with a scream, but with a sigh that becomes a wind, scattering the last of their shadows into dust.
