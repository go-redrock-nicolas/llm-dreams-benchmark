I am dreaming. A hush falls over the arena, thick with the scent of ozone and cold metal. The air hums with the restrained power of the machine before me—a colossal, spiraling tower of whirring gears, suspended platforms, and electrified rings that flicker violet in the dim light. The **"Celestial Ascent"**, they call it. No one has ever reached the top and lived to tell the tale. The previous daredevils lie broken in the shadows, their failures whispered about like ghost stories.  

But tonight, they chose *me*.  

The crowd is a sea of masked faces, their glittering eyes wide, breath held tight. Somewhere in the stands, a lone violin plays a tremulous melody, as if the musician already mourns my inevitable fall. The ringmaster—a tall figure clad in a coat of raven feathers—extends a gloved hand toward the structure.  

**"Begin."**  

I take a breath, step forward—and the world *shifts*.  

The first leap sends me spinning between two rotating discs, their edges lined with crackling energy. I twist midair, land on the lower one—only for it to tilt violently. The crowd gasps as I barely catch the next platform with my fingertips, muscles screaming. My heart hammers, but I *pull*.  

Higher. Faster. Danger dances with me now.  

A cascade of glowing orbs erupts from nowhere, red as dying stars. I vault through them, feeling their heat singe my skin. Laughter bubbles in my chest—*this is madness!*—but I don’t stop. The tower groans, its mechanics twisting into new, impossible configurations. A bridge of pure light forms for half a second—I sprint across before it shatters like glass beneath me.  

Then… the final challenge.  

A vertical loop of pure flame, spinning like a hellish wheel. The crowd is screaming—I can’t tell if in terror or exhilaration. The ringmaster’s voice booms: **"The last who tried this turned to ash!"**  

I don’t hesitate.  

I *run straight into the fire*.  

Heat wraps around me, but instead of burning, I feel… weightless. The flames become wings. The tower? A ladder to the sky. And as I burst through the top—gasps turn to deafening cheers. Stars rain down like confetti. The ringmaster bows, and the arena erupts in colors that don’t exist in the waking world.  

And then, just as suddenly—  

I wake up.  

The echo of the crowd lingers in my ears. My fingers clutch the sheets, but my skin smells faintly of smoke.  

And somewhere, in the dark, I swear I hear the violin play one last, bittersweet note.
