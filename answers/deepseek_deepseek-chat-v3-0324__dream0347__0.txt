I am dreaming. The air around me hums with a strange, electric tension, thick as syrup and buzzing like a swarm of distant bees. I stand in a vast, glass-domed observatory, but instead of stars, the night sky above pulses with veins of golden light, threading through the darkness like luminous roots. My breath comes quick and shallow—my chest aches, tight as if bound by invisible wires. I look down and see them: thin, glowing filaments winding around my ribs, pulsating in sync with my uneven heartbeat. 

With each anxious thought, the threads flare brighter, constricting deeper. A whisper curls in my ear—wind or a voice, I can’t tell—*"You’ve been ignoring me."* My skin prickles. Suddenly, the floor beneath me is no longer solid but a shifting pool of liquid mercury, reflecting my fractured silhouette back at me. My legs sink, heavy with exhaustion, as if the stress has turned my bones to lead. 

I reach out, desperate, and my fingers brush the edge of a mirror that wasn’t there before. In it, my reflection is blurred, smudged with dark streaks like ink dissolving in water. But then—I exhale, long and slow, and the reflection clarifies. The golden threads loosen, dimming as my breath steadies. A warmth spreads from my palms, melting the tension, and the mercury hardens into solid ground beneath me. 

The dream shudders. A single feather drifts down from the dome—soft, iridescent—and lands in my open hand. *"Listen,"* the wind murmurs, and for the first time, I do. The wires unravel. The air clears. And in the hush, I finally understand. 

Then I wake—heart steady, skin humming, the dream’s weight lifting like mist under morning light.
