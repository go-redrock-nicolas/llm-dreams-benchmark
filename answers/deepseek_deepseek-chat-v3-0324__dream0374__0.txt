I am dreaming. The air hums with the phantom electricity of a grand hall—somewhere between a gilded ballroom and a corporate amphitheater, bathed in liquid gold light that pools on marble floors. Murmurs rise and fall like tidal whispers, a sea of faces shifting in anticipation. At the front of the room, under the molten glow of a spotlight, *they* stand. The person who is being praised. Their smile is beatific, arms cradling an award that gleams like stolen moonlight.  

Every vein in my body pulses with dissonance.  

Because I remember the late nights, the raw-knuckled effort, the way my thoughts had etched themselves into the project like invisible ink suddenly illuminated. Yet here, in this shimmering unreality, my contributions are ghosts—felt but unseen. No one else notices the fingerprints I left behind. No one hears the echo of my voice in the polished words they speak.  

The dream twists.  

For a moment, time becomes honey-thick, slow and surreal. The award in their hands distorts—its surface flickers like a broken mirror, reflecting not their face, but mine. I reach for it, only for the image to shatter into a thousand iridescent shards. They don't cut; they dissolve against my skin like sorrow.  

And then—  

A whisper coils from the unseen corners of the dream, soft as cobweb: *"Does it matter, if the work exists?"*  

I don’t answer.  

But the recognition I crave flickers somewhere inside me, a small, defiant flame. The dream shudders, the room melting into something new—a quiet space where my hands are holding something unnameable, something *mine.* The weight of it is solid. Real.  

And then, just as I begin to understand—  

I wake.
