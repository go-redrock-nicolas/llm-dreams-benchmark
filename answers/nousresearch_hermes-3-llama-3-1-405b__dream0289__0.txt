I am dreaming. I experience a devastating personal loss that shakes my foundation. In the aftermath of this trauma, I find myself traveling through the eye of a storm. Everything around me is spinning, and as I'm sucked in, I feel weightless. I can sense the chaos is outside, but right here in the center, there's an eerie calm. The deeper I go into the storm, the more I become a part of it. 

The spinning gradually slows down and the storm turns into a whirlpool of colors. They're swirling all around, bursting and dissolving into one another, forming a mesmerizing flow of vibrant hues. I feel the energy coursing through me, pulsating with each color that flows through. It's as if the vibrations are retuning my frequency. 

I see a beautiful creature materialize in front of me. It looks like a dragon, but instead of scales, it has fur in vivid shades of blue and purple. Its eyes are bright and glowing like stars. It holds out its paw as if to invite me and so I climb onto its back. It flaps its majestic wings and up we go, soaring above the whirlpool of colors. 

The dream shifts again and we are now flying over majestic landscapes- lush green forests, expansive golden deserts, towering white mountain peaks, endless azure oceans with sapphire and emerald islands scattered like jewels upon them. Looking down at this breathtaking scenery, I feel at peace. I can feel the strength of the dragon's wings and the wind rushing by, filling my lungs and clearing my mind. It's as if I'm leaving behind all the layers of hurt and pain with each gust of wind that passes us by.

Finally, the dragon lands in front of a lithe waterfall cascading into a crystal-clear pool. I slide off the dragon's back and step into the pool. The water shimmers with iridescence, its touch cool and soothing. As I submerge myself and let the water wash over me, I can feel it cleansing away the remnants of loss and sorrow, leaving me renewed and healed.

As my head breaks the surface, I see a radiant butterfly emerge from the glittering mist of the waterfall. It flutters around me and comes to rest on my hand. Its wings are a spectrum of colors, just like the whirlpool, shimmering and luminous. And as I gaze at this ethereal creature, a sense of hope fills my entire being, a feeling that no matter how deep the loss, life always finds a way to bring beauty out of brokenness.

The dream fades and I awaken to a new dawn, carrying the echoes of the dream in my heart. It's a reminder that even in the eye of the storm, there exists a quiet center where peace is found, strength is renewed, and hope takes flight.
