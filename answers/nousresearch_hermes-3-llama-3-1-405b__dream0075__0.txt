I am dreaming. I'm in the grandest hall I've ever seen.  A sweeping cathedral ceiling holds thousands of enchanted, shimmering lights.  

The prestigious award I'm pursuing levitates in the center of the room, radiating a soft luminescence that casts its glow on my eager face.  There are other contestants, each representative of their galaxies far away.  Some have two heads, some are translucent.  Some communicate in frequencies, others through iridescent fluctuations. 

Unfazed by their otherworldliness, I steel my focus as the final evaluation begins.

A low hum fills the air.  My years of preparation have manifested in supernatural abilities.  I meld my essence with the elemental forces surrounding us: the air molecules bend to my will, the solid marble beneath my feet liquefies.  

My challenge is to project the result of a billion outcomes of my life based on my current essence.  With every fiber of my being, I believe in the best outcome, the one in which my potential is limitlessly expanded, where my actions ripple across galaxies to inspire others to achieve their own greatness.  

A celestial judge with galaxies swarming in her eyes nods at me, and I inhale sharply.  My matter disintegrates, diffuses, and condenses before the luminaries.  They witness my potential unfurl: I embody my ultimate state of boundlessness, a geometric entity of refracted lights rotating and spinning out new life from the vortex of my energy.  

This can't be real, yet it's my reality in this dream.  The lights converge and I return to my being, the effort exhausting me completely.  The judge approaches me, and with her celestial gaze she imparts the wisdom of my journey into me.

Upon this conferral, it is my turn to nod.  My fellow contestants dissolve one by one, returning to their corners of the universe, honored and changed by the experience. They, like the lights above me, shimmer and gleam before their departure.  

As for that award, it was never just an object to claim.  Instead, it has woven its light into my core, a symbol of the commitment and realization of those billion possible outcomes.  A dream borne of the deepest parts of my imagination, now an ethereal and internal radiance of my spirit.
