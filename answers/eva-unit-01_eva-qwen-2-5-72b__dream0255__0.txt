I am dreaming. In this dream, I notice subtle changes in the person's behavior that suggest they might be struggling with something. Perhaps the sparkle in their eyes dims at moments, or their smiles sometimes waver imperceptibly. Although they maintain a cheerful demeanor, I can sense waves of hidden emotions barely beneath the surface.

Being mindful of their boundaries, I would offer a gentle and compassionate approach, letting them know that I'm here for them without probing too deeply. 

Feeling hesitant, I gently reach out and lightly touch their shoulder.

Taking a careful breath, I softly speak to them, mindful of their feelings.

Taking a step back to give them some space, I convey my empathy and support without invasiveness.

I would continue to be attentive to their needs, offering my presence and understanding while respecting their privacy. This way, I hope to create a safe and open environment for them to eventually share their true feelings when they're ready while maintaining our relationship's integrity.
