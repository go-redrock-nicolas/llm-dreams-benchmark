I am dreaming. **I am dreaming.**  

The air hums with a low, golden murmur—laughter, clinking glasses, muffled voices like distant waves. A grand hall stretches endlessly before me, its ceiling lost in a haze of softly glowing chandeliers that drift like jellyfish in a midnight sea. The walls shift subtly, adorned with tapestries that ripple as if breathing, embroidered with threads of silver and ink-black. I don’t remember arriving here, but I *know* I’m searching for someone—the only familiar presence in this murmuring labyrinth.  

Clusters of people form and dissolve like schools of fish, their faces indistinct yet vivid. One group surrounds a grand piano that plays itself, keys moving under unseen fingers, the melody twisting into something nostalgic yet unrecognizable. They sway to the music, their silhouettes elongating one moment, squat and round the next, shadows dancing behind them in defiance of logic. A woman with iridescent skin turns, catching my eye—her mouth moves, but her voice is swallowed by the buzz of the room.  

Another circle stands frozen, mid-gesture, all of them holding brass instruments to their lips, no sound escaping. Their eyes follow me as I pass, wide and unblinking, irises swirling like spilled ink in water. A faint smell of old books and burning sugar clings to them.  

Then, a doorway appears—a ribbon of darkness in the wall, hung with tattered velvet. Through it, I glimpse a courtyard under a purple sky, where figures in moth-wing cloaks whisper over a fountain of liquid starlight. One of them *might* be the person I seek—but when I step forward, the threshold flexes, repelling me like opposing magnets.  

The crowd’s murmur swells into a chorus of half-remembered names, overlapping until they become a single, pulsing note. My reflection flashes in a passing tray of silver goblets—except it’s not *mine*. The face grins back with too many teeth before the vision shatters.  

Then—**a touch on my shoulder.** I spin, heart drumming, and—  

—*wake.*  

(But for the briefest second, just before consciousness returns, I swear the dream lingers… and the scent of burning sugar follows me into the light.)
