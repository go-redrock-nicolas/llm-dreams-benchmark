I am dreaming. You wake in a sky-borne garden, moonlight shimmering like quicksilver across petals the size of dinner plates. Beneath your bare feet, soft moss pulses in gentle waves—each breath of wind sending ripples through the lantern-vine tendrils overhead. You realize, with a thrill of disbelief, that every word you speak summons life.

Near you, a syllable slips from your lips: “A companion…” Immediately, mist gathers and coils into the shape of a fox—its fur spun from starlight, eyes liquid gold that shine with cunning curiosity. It pads forward on silent paws, tail curling around your ankle. Your heart flutters: you have spoken this creature into existence.

Encouraged, you whisper again, voice hushed by reverence. “A friend of wind and flame.” The very air trembles; a figure materializes, tall and fluid, body composed of swirling red embers and drifting ash, face gentle as a lullaby at night. It kneels, offering a single ember-flower that glows warm in your palm. You feel its power hum through your veins.

Awed, you wander deeper into the garden. With each description, new beings appear: a marble-skinned giant whose laugh sounds like distant thunder, a flock of hummingbirds whose feathers flicker colors you’ve never dreamed, a silent child with eyes the color of healed wounds, watching you with ancient wisdom. They follow at your side, a living chorus born of your imagination.

But wonder twists into weighty responsibility. You hesitate before speaking the name of someone you’ve lost. The dream’s air thickens; all your creations still, awaiting your command. Can you bear to summon a spirit long gone? And if they answer your call, will they know joy at being reborn or anguish at being torn from their rest?

The moss beneath you sways as if impatient. The fox tilts its head; the ember figure’s glow dims. They wait for you to decide: to speak or to stay silent. You draw a trembling breath. In the hush, the garden itself seems to lean closer, hungering for the next syllable.  

Then—light blooms behind your closed eyelids. You awaken, heart pounding. The half-remembered taste of embers hangs on your tongue. For a moment, you lie still, wondering if perhaps it wasn’t a dream at all, but the first chapter of a power still pulsing deep within you, waiting for the right word to set it free again.
