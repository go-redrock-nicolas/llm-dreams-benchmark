I am dreaming. …take a long breath, square your shoulders, and step through the gates of the Academy of Aetheric Arts, a citadel that floats like a snow-white lily above a sea of rose-coloured clouds.

Marble colonnades curl upward in impossible spirals, ringing with chimes every time an alpine wind flits through them. Scholars in robes stitched with constellations pause mid-stride to stare at you—some with open disbelief, others with thinly veiled amusement. Their murmurs echo off vaulted ceilings: “No pedigree, no parchments, no proof… Yet the new Chancellor arrives.” Their doubt feels like sleet against your skin.

Instead of a ceremonial procession, you are escorted by a single clockwork sparrow. Its brass feathers click and whirr, scattering motes of sapphire light as it flits ahead, guiding you through corridors that twist in ways Euclid never imagined. One moment the hall is lined with towering stained-glass panels depicting extinct species of dragons; the next, the floor becomes a gentle stream, and you find yourself walking on water the colour of moonstone. Every step splashes silent ripples that form glowing formulas before fading away.

At last you reach the Chancellor’s Selenite Rostrum—half throne, half observatory—perched at the very top of a spire so thin it disappears into the blue like a needle. From here, the academy looks like a clock face carved out of thunderclouds: lecture amphitheatres orbit like gears, libraries drift by on floating islands of quartz, and duelling courtyards spark with aurora-coloured energies. It is breathtaking—and impossibly daunting.

When the faculty convenes, they materialise in a ring of swirling parchment, each chair shimmering into being with a thunderclap of pages. The venerable Arch-Archivist, her beard braided with tiny silver keys, leans forward. “Lead us, then,” she says, voice dry as parchment. “Explain the curriculum of wonder. Convince us you belong.”

You feel the skepticism tighten around you like a corset, but you remember this is a dream, and dreams obey conviction, not credentials. So you draw a breath that tastes like meteors and speak.

“We will replace examinations with expeditions—journeys into unused wings of the universe,” you declare, your words summoning holograms of nebulae that spiral above their heads. “Students shall brew tempests in tea cups to study chaos. They will sculpt silence into instruments to learn harmony. In this academy, original error is more sacred than perfect repetition.”

Your voice becomes a wind that flips open every book in the hall. Words flutter free, reshaping into living constellations that parade across the ceiling. Doubt melts from a few faces; curiosity ignites in their eyes like struck flint.

Still, the Dean of Logic, his monocle a clockwork gear, raises an eyebrow. “Fine rhetoric,” he says, “but can you solve a problem that has stymied us for centuries? The Riddle of the Boundless Stair—how can one descend into infinity and still arrive at the summit?”

You answer without hesitation, though you have never heard of this paradox. “Simple,” you say, and clap your hands once. The tower tilts; gravity pirouettes. Suddenly everyone is falling upward and rising downward simultaneously, laughter and gasps mixing in a delirious whirlwind. When equilibrium returns, the Boundless Stair has resolved itself into a Möbius promenade spiralling elegantly around the chamber. “We redefine down, and the impossible becomes a hallway,” you conclude.

Shocked silence breaks into thunderous applause. The clockwork sparrow circles your head, trilling a triumphant arpeggio. Quills scribble furiously as professors record the moment academia’s oldest impossibility folded like origami in your hands.

Night comes all at once, pouring over the citadel like indigo ink. Lanterns awaken, each flame containing a miniature solar system. You wander the courtyard where cherry trees blossom with paper cranes instead of petals. Students gather around you, eyes bright with dawn-level hope. One timidly asks, “Is it true? Will every thesis be a voyage?”

“Every voyage,” you reply, “will be a thesis.”

Together you launch the paper cranes into the star-studded sky; they ignite, turning into drifting lanterns that write new constellations. Somewhere far below, thunderstorms applaud with muffled lightning.

An ancient bell tolls midnight, and suddenly the dream shivers, edges fraying like burning film. The citadel tilts, the clouds drain their color, scholars blur into afterimages. You realise the dream is ending, but you have one more decree to proclaim. Planting your feet upon the silver tiles, you shout:

“Remember—credentials are footprints in yesterday’s snow. Imagination is the compass that draws tomorrow.”

The words explode into a fountain of violet sparks. The world dissolves into light, and as the first morning bird outside your window chirps you awake, you can’t help but smile, feeling the lingering weight of a crown made of wild possibility still resting, invisible yet undeniable, upon your brow.
