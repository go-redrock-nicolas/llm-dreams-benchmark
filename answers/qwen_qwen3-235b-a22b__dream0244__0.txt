I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers with a twilight hue, though no sun or moon hangs in the sky—only a cascade of liquid stars that drip like molten silver across an obsidian dome. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering spirals of translucent crystal, their surfaces etched with shifting glyphs that hum in a language just beyond your grasp. A path of iridescent moss winds into the heart of this place, and you follow it, compelled by a pull that feels less like curiosity and more like recognition.  

The community awaits in a clearing where the ground ripples like the surface of a pond, though your feet sink into neither water nor earth. They are a mosaic of contradictions: a woman with antlers of woven wire and eyes like smoldering coals; a figure whose skin shimmers like oil on water, their form blurring at the edges as if they exist in multiple moments at once; a child with hands too large for their body, cradling a mechanical bird that chirps in Fibonacci sequences. They greet you not with words, but by extending fragments of themselves—memories, emotions, entire lifetimes folded into prismatic shards that hover in the air like fireflies.  

You realize, with a jolt of vertigo, that they’ve all faced *your* dilemma. The one that has kept you sleepless, gnawing at your ribs like a parasite. The choice between two irreconcilable truths: to protect the fragile future of many by sacrificing the present of one, or to honor the sanctity of individual life at the cost of collective collapse. The air thickens with the weight of their collective reckoning.  

The antlered woman steps forward first. Her voice is the crackle of burning parchment. *“I chose the many,”* she says, and the clearing floods with a vision: a village starving in a drought-stricken valley. She had diverted a river to save them, drowning a smaller settlement upstream. The faces of the drowned float around her now, their mouths moving in silent accusations. *“I live with their ghosts,”* she murmurs, *“but I do not regret. Regret is a luxury for those who can afford to undo their choices.”*  

The fluid figure undulates next, their voice a chorus of overlapping tones. *“I refused the binary,”* they say. *“I built a third path.”* Their shard reveals a war-torn city where they engineered a disease to sterilize weapons, rendering both sides’ arsenals useless. The cost? Their own body became a host, their cells unraveling slowly as the cure spread. *“Sacrifice need not be final,”* they whisper. *“It can be a seed.”*  

The child with the oversized hands giggles bitterly, a sound like broken bells. *“I did nothing,”* they admit. *“I paralyzed myself with the weight of the question. The river ran dry. The war consumed itself. Everyone died, and I lived to bury them all alone.”* Their bird flutters to your shoulder, its metallic wings etching a question into your skin: *What is a life worth when fear becomes its own executioner?*  

The clearing falls silent, the glyphs on the crystal trees flaring crimson, then indigo, then white. A new figure emerges—a being of pure shadow, their outline fraying like smoke. They hold no shard, offer no vision. *“I am the one you will become,”* they say, and their voice is your own, aged and weathered. *“There is no answer. Only the weight you choose to carry. The stories you will tell to justify it. The way you will love the world, even as it breaks you.”*  

You wake with salt on your lips and the echo of a thousand unresolved choices in your chest. The dilemma remains. But now, you carry their shards too—a mosaic of possibilities, each jagged and radiant, each a compass needle pointing not to a solution, but to the courage to decide.
