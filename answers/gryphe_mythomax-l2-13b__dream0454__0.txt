I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast forest, lost and confused. As I look around, I see a figure emerging from the gloominess, slowly walking towards me. To my surprise, it's someone whom I've been caught in a recurring conflict pattern with - a colleague whom I have always found challenging to get along with. 

The air around us is tense, yet strangely peaceful. We stand there looking at each other, neither of us moving or speaking. It's as though we are both waiting for the other to make the first move. Suddenly, the tension breaks, and we both break into a fit of laughter. Our laughter echoes through the forest, and it feels like a weight has been lifted off our shoulders. 

As we continue to laugh, we begin to walk towards each other, and I sense a shift in our dynamic. We start to talk, not about work or our past conflicts but about our hopes, dreams, and fears. We share stories that we've never shared with anyone else before. We listen intently as the other person speaks, offering words of encouragement and comfort. 

As we walk deeper into the forest, the light begins to fade, and we come upon a small clearing. In the middle of the clearing, there's a beautiful golden tree with intricate carvings all over its trunk and branches. It's as though it's been waiting for us. 

We approach the tree together, and without saying a word, we both reach out our hands to touch it. Magically, the golden tree begins to glow brighter and brighter, casting a warm, golden light around us. 

Without realizing it, we have formed a circle around the tree, our hands still intertwined. Suddenly a warm, comforting energy engulfs us, and we feel a deep sense of peace and understanding. We know that we have broken the cycle of conflict and have forged a new bond of mutual respect and friendship. 

As the dream fades, I wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, ready to face whatever challenges may come my way.
