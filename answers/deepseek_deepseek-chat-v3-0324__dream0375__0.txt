I am dreaming. The world around me is painted in hues I have never seen before—colors that shimmer like oil on water, shifting between deep indigo and molten gold. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the distant song of a cosmic choir, vibrating through my bones. Every step I take leaves a faint, ghostly imprint of light on the ground, lingering for just a moment before dissolving into the ether.

As I walk through this surreal dreamscape, I become acutely aware of the people around me—some shimmering with an inner radiance, while others seem cloaked in shadows that drink in the surrounding light.  

One figure approaches, tall and radiant, their presence like standing beneath a warm summer sun. As they draw near, a surge of energy courses through me—my fingertips tingle, my breath deepens, and colors sharpen, as though the dream itself is coming into higher resolution. Their laughter rings like wind chimes, sending ripples through the air. I feel lighter, as though I could take flight at any moment, buoyed by their presence alone.  

But then, another emerges from the mist—a shadowed silhouette with a faint, flickering aura, resembling a candle caught in a cold breeze. As they step closer, a heaviness settles in my chest. My limbs grow leaden, my thoughts blur like ink bleeding into water. The dream itself seems to dim around us, the once-vivid colors leaching into muted grays. Something unseen tugs at my essence, as though attempting to siphon away my vitality, leaving me hollow.  

I pull back instinctively, seeking refuge near those luminous figures whose very existence seems to amplify the dream’s magic. I begin to notice patterns—the way the vibrant souls glow brighter when woven together, their energies intertwining in harmonious arcs of light. Meanwhile, the shadowed ones drift at the edges, their draining presence casting faint ripples of distortion through the dreamworld.  

A whisper echoes through the air—not in words, but in a knowing that settles deep within: *Some connections feed the soul, while others hunger for it.* The realization pours over me like liquid starlight, illuminating hidden truths about the waking world.  

Just as this revelation takes root, the dream starts to dissolve, fading from the edges inward—but the understanding remains, lingering long after the colors have vanished into the dawn.
