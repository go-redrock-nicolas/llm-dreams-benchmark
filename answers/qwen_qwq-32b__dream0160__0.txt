I am dreaming. I’m in a vast, bioluminescent forest.  The trees are tall, but not like Earth trees.  They’re spirals of glowing coral, pulsing with an inner light in gradients of cerulean and amethyst.  The ground is spongy underfoot, a living moss that hums softly when I walk.  I can hear water nearby, but it’s not a stream— more like a chorus of liquid silver voices.  

A figure emerges from the light, androgynous, wearing a cloak of woven starlight.  Its face shifts, features morphing like clouds.  "The path you’ve taken has many echoes," it says, voice resonant with layered harmonies.  "Every failure is a seed.  You must plant it in the right soil."

Then the ground, a living entity, envelops me, and I wake up.\n
