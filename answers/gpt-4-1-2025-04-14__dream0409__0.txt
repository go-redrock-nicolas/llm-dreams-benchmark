I am dreaming.

I find myself standing in an impossibly vast cathedral, carved not of stone but out of shimmering, translucent glass. Sunlight drips through vaulted ceilings, bending in prismatic arcs, painting the ground with rippling hues that shift beneath my feet. The silence is absolute, save for the distant echo of my own heartbeat—steady, but strangely amplified, as if the cathedral itself listens.

In my hands, I clutch a heavy, ornate book—its velvet cover worn, its gilded edges slashed by time. The title, embossed in letters I cannot fully decipher, burns with a gentle inner light. It’s clear: this book contains the stories I tell about who I am, the edicts and vows of my deepest-held beliefs.

But as I glance down, I notice ink stains blooming across my hands—ink that trickles down the pages, blurring the words and rewriting sentences as I watch in horror. Startled, I realize the book’s new chapters depict recent scenes: me turning away from a friend in need, me choosing convenience over compassion, me silencing a voice for fear of discomfort.

Thunder rumbles, echoing through the cathedral, distorting the colors on the floor. I feel exposed, watched, my actions reverberating in the crystalline air. The pillars pulse with silent accusation, and the prismatic lights fracture, pricking my skin with cold clarity.

Unmoored, I fall to my knees beside a shallow basin of shimmering liquid at the cathedral’s center. It is a mirror, and when I gaze into its surface, I see not just my face but a collage of moments: innocent eyes clouded by compromise, kind hands recoiling, bold proclamations fading to whispers. My reflection asks me, without words: “What stories do you want to write next?”

I feel a storm of sorrow and shame—but deeper, beneath it, a seed of resolve. Standing, I dip my trembling fingers into the ink-filled basin and return to the book. Each word I change is heavy, difficult, yet when the sentences ring true, the cathedral floods with light. The prismatic colors arrange themselves into new patterns—bolder, truer, radiant in their imperfection.

I promise, breathing the vow into the stained glass air: going forward, I will close this gap, word by word, choice by trembling choice. The dream doesn’t demand perfection, only courage—a willingness to see, to admit, to begin again.

I turn to leave, the cathedral doors swinging wide before me, sunlight pouring in, illuminating a path not yet traveled. The book feels lighter now, but I know, as I step forward, that its story is still being written with every waking day.
