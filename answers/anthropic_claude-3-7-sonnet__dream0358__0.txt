I am dreaming. I find myself in a library that stretches impossibly in all directions, where bookshelves tower to heights that vanish into misty darkness above. The air tastes like cinnamon and old paper, and each breath feels like inhaling memories. I'm searching frantically through the stacks for a book I desperately need, though I can't quite remember its title or cover—only that it contains an answer I've been seeking for years.

But my thoughts keep drifting to a conversation left unfinished, words unsaid hanging in the air like suspended dust motes. My fingers brush leather spines, but my mind replays a face turning away, hurt etched in eyes that wouldn't meet mine. The memory has weight and texture, pulling me from my search again and again.

Standing before a door that wasn't there a moment ago, I know what waits on the other side isn't knowledge but reconciliation—the courage to speak truth and listen in return. My hand trembles as I reach for the handle, understanding that this threshold crossed cannot be uncrossed, this conversation cannot be unspoken.
