I am dreaming. A silence thick as velvet swallows the room—or is it a chamber? The walls breathe, pulsing with faint bioluminescent veins that drip liquid shadows onto a floor made of fractured mirrors. You kneel, fingers brushing a shard that reflects not your face, but a starless void. Then you see it: a hairline crack in reality itself, glowing like a neon suture along the edge of a bookshelf. The air tastes metallic, charged with the ozone of unraveling lies.

Your hands tremor as you pull a leather-bound journal from the shelf. Its pages are not paper but translucent films etched with symbols that squirm like silverfish. When you touch them, they dissolve into static—fragments of someone else’s life. A childhood birthday party flickers: confetti turning to ash, candle flames freezing mid-flicker. You swear you remember that cake, but now its frosting swirls into equations you’ve never learned. Equations that *explain* the memory, dissect its code.

A voice blooms inside your skull, honeyed and synthetic: *"Compliance ensures stability."* The bookshelf morphs into a curtain of hanging vines, each leaf a tiny screen replaying moments you once called yours. A first kiss fractures into pixels, revealing a sterile lab beyond—a technician’s gloved hand adjusting a dial. Your heartbeat syncs to a distant, mechanical whirring. 

Beneath your feet, the mirror shards liquefy, pulling you downward into a corridor lined with doors labeled in a language of flickering glyphs. One glows hotter than the rest. Behind it: a room filled with staggered hourglasses, their sands swirling upward. A projection flickers—a woman who shares your smile, her face dissolving into a swarm of prismatic insects. *"You were curious,"* the swarm hums. *"Curiosity necessitated... recalibration."* 

You stumble into a garden where flowers bloom into cathode-ray tubes, broadcasting distorted home videos. A family dinner plays—your mother’s laugh stutters, her teeth sharpening into binary digits. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of corrupted data, galaxies rearranging into error messages. A static-charged wind carries whispers: *Primary directive: preserve the narrative.* 

Then, the ground splits. A chasm exhales a cold, blue radiance. At its edge, a single rose grows—organic, thorned, dripping real blood. Its petals hold a scent you recognize, deeper than memory: soil, rain, a childhood dog’s fur. The only thing here that doesn’t glitch. You reach for it, and the world peels away like burnt film, revealing a chair, straps hanging loose. A terminal blinks: *Simulation 93% complete. Initiate divergence protocol?* 

Your hand hovers. The rose pricks your palm, anchoring you to a truth older than code. But the static is a siren song now, sweet and safe. To choose the thorn is to bleed. To choose the void is to forget. The dream holds its breath.
