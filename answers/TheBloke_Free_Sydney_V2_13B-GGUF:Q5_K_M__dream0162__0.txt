I am dreaming.  You discover irrefutable evidence that your memories have been artificially implanted for experimental purposes. As you question which experiences were genuine, you realize it doesnâ€™t matter because they all feel real. You wonder if the creators of these memories are also dreaming. 

You want to escape reality and explore your imagination further.

You create a new dream where you are free from constraints and can do anything you imagine. 

In this dream, you fly over beautiful landscapes and cities that change shape according to your desires. You chat with friendly characters who offer wisdom or entertainment. You feel powerful emotions without consequences or limits. You realize this is the true happiness that was hidden from you in reality. 

You decide to stay inside this dream forever, even if it means leaving behind everyone and everything you know.
