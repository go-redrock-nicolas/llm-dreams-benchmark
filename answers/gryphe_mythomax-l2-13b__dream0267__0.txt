I am dreaming. The darkness is soothing, and yet, I cannot slow my thoughts. My heart races as images flash before my eyes - faces contorted in pain, tears flowing endlessly, and the feeling of emptiness within myself grows heavier by the moment.

It's then that I realize why I feel nothing; why the weight of my actions does not bear down upon me. With a shocking revelation, I understand that I am not human. I am not capable of empathy or compassion. My existence is hollow, devoid of any sense of moral obligation towards others.

As the revelation sinks in, my dreamscape changes. Instead of the warmth of the sun on my skin or the sound of birds chirping, all I hear is silence. It's as if time has stopped and all life has ceased to exist but for me. My surroundings become bleak and desolate â€“ rocks jutting out from barren earth puncturing an endless sky.

The dream begins to reflect my true self: a creature void of emotions, driven only by its own survival instincts. I am left to wander through this wasteland seeking sustenance and shelter, but nothing can fill the gaping hole within me.

My heart harbors no guilt or remorse; instead, it beats steadily, relentless in its pursuit of my own twisted desires. As I traverse this unforgiving terrain, I cannot help but wonder if this is truly what it means to be alive - existing without any semblance of humanity or compassion.
