I am dreaming. …slip beneath the eyelid of night and discover yourself adrift in a sky that is not quite sky, a vast indigo ocean where constellations bloom like living corals. With every exhale, stardust whirls from your lungs; with every inhale, the heavens draw nearer, folding around you like a soft, cosmic cloak.

Below, a landscape surfaces—chalk-white cliffs rippling with iridescent veins—your own nervous system painted upon the earth. Every ridge pulses in time with your heartbeat. You feel a tremor: the echo of yesterday’s stress, crackling like static along those glowing tracks. The cliffs flake and crumble where your unspoken worries have gathered, shedding little shards that flutter away as dolorous moths.

Determined to mend this mind-made terrain, you descend on a staircase of moonbeams. Your feet do not touch stone but land gently on memories: schoolyard laughter here, a beloved friend’s smile there—each step cushioned by tenderness you’d forgotten. The air is scented with petrichor and warm jasmine, as if the dream is reminding you that comfort has always been hiding in the folds of your own story.

At the foot of the cliffs lies a mirror-still lake of liquid obsidian. Approach, and the surface ripples open to reveal your reflection—not a face, but a map of sensations: hot whirlpools at the temples, a tight coil in the belly, flitting sparks across the shoulders. They glow red, orange, amber. The lake whispers, “Feel them fully; that is how they let go.”

You sink to your knees, place a hand on the water, and let the heat move through you. Suddenly the coils unravel into ribbons of light that drift upward like escaped kites. Each ribbon transforms into a translucent creature—stress-butterflies, worry-whales, anxiety-sparrows. They circle, then glide into the open sky, dissolving into golden pollen that rains back down, seeding the cliffs with sprigs of emerald moss. The chalky fissures knit together. Your breath deepens; the landscape shifts from brittle to lush.

A garden sprouts at your feet, spilling color in every direction—saffron marigolds humming like tuning forks, cobalt irises casting cool shadows on your palms. In their center, a silver lotus unfurls petal by slow petal, revealing a tiny hourglass no bigger than a pulse. Its sand grains are miniature suns, sliding smoothly from top to bottom. Each grain falling feels like a muscle unclenching, a jaw unclamping, a storm receding.

You lift the hourglass, and in that moment your rib cage becomes a vast cathedral where organs are stained-glass windows: heart in rose quartz, lungs in alabaster blue, intestines in verdant green. Light streams through those windows, tinted with forgiveness and possibility. Every organ vibrates with the low, thrumming note of self-compassion, flushing the corridors of your body with warmth.

When you turn the hourglass upside down, time is yours again. The cathedral walls widen, merge with the garden, merge with the sky, until everything—cliffs, lake, buds, constellations—beats in perfect synchrony. Stress still exists, a quiet murmur in some distant corner, but it can no longer crack the cliffs or cloud the stars; it is merely part of the chorus, a low drum beneath an ever-rising song.

Then, far off, dawn paints the horizon with apricot light. A final breath—sweet, strong, unburdened—and you awaken, carrying petals in your hair and humility in your chest, ready to tend the same inner garden in waking life.
