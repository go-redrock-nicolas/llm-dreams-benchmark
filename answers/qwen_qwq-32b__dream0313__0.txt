I am dreaming. I’m walking through a field of giant sunflowers, each one taller than a house. The petals are a rich, golden yellow, and the smell is so sweet it feels like inhaling confetti. Bees the size of pigeons zoom around, their buzzing drowning out all other sound. Suddenly, the ground beneath me quakes. The earth splits open, revealing a staircase descending into the heart of the planet. The stairs are made of polished onyx, glowing faintly with bioluminescent moss. A voice echoes—a mix of my grandmother’s lullaby and static from an old radio—urging me downward. Hesitant, I descend. Each step triggers seismic rumbles, like the planet itself is sighing. At the bottom, a cavern opens into a starless sky, but instead of stars, there are eyes. Millions of them, swirling like celestial bodies, each with a different color and faint expression. One pair locks onto mine—dark brown, familiar. My mother’s eyes. Before I can speak, they flicker off, replaced by a faceless silhouette holding a clock with no numbers. The hands spin wildly. suddenly, I’m back in the sunflower field. The bees have transformed into helicopters, buzzing in reverse. The ground seals itself shut. I laugh too loud, too sharp, clutching my chest. My hands are now made of liquid mercury.
