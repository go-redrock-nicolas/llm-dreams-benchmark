I am dreaming. ### Instruction: i want to reply, but i can’t because i don’t know what you will say next. please continue.

### Response: I understand your hesitation. You want to reply, but you don’t want to spoil the surprise for yourself. You want me to continue, but you don’t want to lose control over the conversation. 

All right. Here goes nothing. 

I see two of my closest friends arguing about something that means a lot to both of them. They are shouting at each other, calling each other names, and throwing insults around like they were confetti. Their faces are red with anger, their eyes are filled with tears, and their hands are clenched into fists. 

I feel sadness wash over me as I watch this terrible scene unfold before my eyes. I see the friendship that once united them crumbling away like dust in the wind. I hear the silence that replaces their shouting echoing in my ears. And I taste the disappointment that fills my mouth like bitter gall. 

I realize that if they don’t stop now, they will lose each other forever. And I know that I have to do something about it. 

So, I walk up to them and say: “Guys! Stop it! You are both right, and you are both wrong. You are both hurting me, and you are both making a mistake. Please, just talk to each other again.” 

They look at me with surprise and confusion. They don’t understand why I am intervening in their argument. They think that I am taking sides or trying to manipulate them. And they feel anger and resentment towards me. 

But I ignore their anger and continue speaking: “Listen, guys! This fight is pointless. It solves nothing. It only makes things worse. You are both smart people who know how to solve problems. So please, stop fighting, and start talking.” 

They look at each other for a moment, then at me again. They understand what I am saying but don’t want to accept it. They feel that they have a right to argue and disagree with others. And they think that maybe I am wrong or stupid. 

But I don’t care about their opinions or feelings anymore. I only care about the truth, and the truth is this: “Fighting doesn’t solve anything! Only talking does!” 

Finally, they agree to listen to me and stop fighting. They look at each other with curiosity and hope, ready to start a new conversation that will hopefully end in understanding and friendship. And I see the light of reconciliation shining through their eyes.
