I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a strange, electric sweetness, like the scent of ozone after a storm, but softer—laced with the perfume of forgotten lullabies. You stand in a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering spires of glass, their translucent trunks refracting light into prismatic rivers that pool on the ground like liquid rainbows. A breeze whispers through them, and the glass sings in response: a chorus of chimes, eerie and beautiful. You open your mouth, uncertain, and a note escapes your lips—a low, trembling C. The sound shivers in the air, and the nearest glass tree shudders. Its branches melt like candle wax, reshaping into delicate filigree feathers, each one quivering with iridescent light. You laugh, and the sound ripples outward, transforming more glass into flocks of paper-thin birds that spiral into the sky, dissolving into mist.  

You wander deeper, your voice testing the world’s malleability. A river of molten silver coils at your feet, and you hum a dissonant chord. The metal convulses, rising like a serpent, then splintering into a thousand droplets that crystallize midair—a suspended constellation of mirrors. Each reflects not your face, but fragments of other lives: a child’s birthday, a shipwreck blooming with coral, a star collapsing in slow motion. You gasp, and the mirrors shatter, their shards becoming moths with wings patterned like galaxies.  

Hungry for more, you press your palm to a boulder of obsidian. It thrums beneath your touch, cold and ancient. You sing a folk tune your grandmother once hummed, your voice trembling with memory. The stone softens, its surface rippling like water, then bursts into a cascade of black roses. Their petals are velvet darkness, each one cradling a glowing ember—a tiny, flickering sun. You pluck one, and it transforms into a living compass in your hand, its needle spinning not north, but toward a distant, pulsing light on the horizon.  

But the power is fickle. When you try to shape the wind, your voice cracks, and the air solidifies into a jagged scaffold of ice. The structure groans, threatening to collapse. You scramble back, singing a frantic apology. The ice melts into a thousand silver fish that leap and arc, weaving themselves into a bridge that stretches into the unknown. Your breath steadies. You step onto it, each footfall turning the fish into stepping stones of warm, golden amber.  

At the horizon, the light resolves into a mountain made of stacked hourglasses, each one filled with sand that glows like embers. You climb, singing a hymn now—a wordless melody that feels older than your bones. The hourglasses melt as you touch them, their sand pooling into a river that carries you upward. At the peak, you find a throne of smoke and thorns. You sit, and the thorns bloom into roses that devour the smoke, leaving a crown of living fire above your head.  

The dream begins to fray at the edges, the way dreams do, but the fire in your crown does not burn. It whispers instead: *This is what creation costs. To unmake is to remake. To sing is to surrender.*  

You wake with a taste of stardust on your tongue and a melody lodged in your ribs—a song that feels unfinished, waiting for your next breath to shape it.
