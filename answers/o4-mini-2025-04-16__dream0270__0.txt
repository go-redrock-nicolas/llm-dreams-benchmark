I am dreaming. …you stretch every syllable across the yawning chasm between dream and language, hoping the tremor in your voice will carry the colors you can’t name. I pause, searching for the right metaphor, and finally say:

“The sky wasn’t blue or purple—it was the inside of a pearl, washed in molten sunlight that rippled like warm honey. Beneath it, I walked through a forest of vines that glowed neon green and indigo, their leaves humming with a faint electric breath. Each step sent tremors through my soles, as if the ground itself pulsed with some vast, slow heartbeat. I could taste the air—a tang of crushed mint and sea salt that left my tongue gently numb.

“Rising before me was a river of liquid silver, so smooth it mirrored my face back at me in perfect clarity. When I dipped my fingertips in, the metal-cold current slid up my arms in rippling waves, sending a thrilling shiver to my spine. Schools of glassy fish darted upstream against impossible gravity, their scales fracturing light into shattered rainbows that danced on my closed eyelids.

“As I waded deeper, the world shifted. The trees melted into towering crystal spires, each one throbbing with pastel light—rose, saffron, lavender—like giant kaleidoscopes tuned to the frequency of my heart. A breeze rose from the alabaster peaks, carrying the scent of scorched sugar and distant fireworks. My skin prickled as though I were being tenderly branded by the air itself.

“In the distance, the horizon buckled and folded, revealing another layer of the dream: a desert of phosphorescent dunes glowing coral and teal under a sky strewn with floating lanterns. I climbed a dune and felt it move beneath me, alive like warm gelatin. When I reached the summit, the lanterns drifted past close enough to touch—each one the size of my palm, humming a lullaby of windchimes that felt like a secret whispered directly into my chest.

“Then—before I could anchor the moment—the dream began to dissolve into rippling light, and I woke with my heart still thrumming, my fingertips aching for the texture of those impossible vines. I wish I could bottle the scent, the taste, the sound; I wish I could hand you the weight of that silver river. But all I have are these quivering words, trying their best to sketch the shape of what words can barely hope to hold.”
