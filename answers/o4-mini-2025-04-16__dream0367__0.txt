I am dreaming.  

I stand at the edge of a vast, phosphorescent lake whose surface ripples in slow-motion waves of amethyst and jade. Above me, twin moons hover—one carved from silver glass, the other a molten ember—casting overlapping shadows that dance across the water. In one interpretation, the moons are sisters locked in an eternal embrace; in another, they are warning eyes, heralding a choice I must make. Both truths press on me with equal weight.

Before me, a slender path materializes from mist—its stones etched with runes that flicker in and out of readability. Each time I glance down, the runes shift: sometimes they spell out memories long buried, sometimes they form questions I have yet to ask myself. I know I could decipher them, but I’m not sure which reading would lead me closer to meaning, and which might betray me into a deeper labyrinth.

Hovering at the path’s end is a colossal tree, its trunk braided with ribbons of starlight and shadow. Some leaves glimmer like tears, others flicker like flames. In one vision, the tree is a bridge to every life I might have lived; in another, it’s the crowning sentinel of my own soul, watching and waiting. I feel its pulse as if it were my own heartbeat—thump. Pause. Thump.  

I move forward, senses alive with paradox:  
• The air tastes of honey and iron, sweet promise tinged with unsettling grit.  
• A chorus of unseen voices murmurs in tongues both familiar and foreign, each syllable resonating in my chest.  
• The ground beneath my feet alternates between yielding sand and solid marble, as if the earth itself can’t decide whether to hold me or let me slip away.  

When I reach out to touch the tree’s bark, my hand passes through a veil of liquid light. Instantly, I’m inside the trunk, surrounded by echoing chambers of memory:  
– A child’s laughter dissolving into tears.  
– A forbidden letter never sent.  
– The moment my reflection winked at me, unbidden, from a cracked mirror.  

All these fragments hang suspended, each a partial truth, each demanding its turn to be believed. Yet none can claim the whole. Navigating this complexity without reducing it, I let each fragment breathe. I listen to the laughter and the sobs as parts of the same melody, weaving them into a song that only I can hear.

In the final chamber, a door of liquid silver swings open. Beyond it lies a horizon that shifts with every blink—sometimes a sunlit meadow, sometimes a storm-swept coast. I step through, carrying every interpretation within me, trusting that the dream’s contradictions will guide me deeper, rather than pull me apart.  

And as I cross that threshold, I awaken—still dreaming.
