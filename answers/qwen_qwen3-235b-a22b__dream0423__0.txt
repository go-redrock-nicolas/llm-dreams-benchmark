I am dreaming. I am dreaming of a place somewhere between a cathedral and a clockwork machine — a towering space carved from stained stone, with gears the size of islands turning slowly in the stained glass ceiling. Ticking in a deep, reverberating tone, each second spills colored light across aisles lined with mirrors. Everything feels familiar, yet utterly alien.

I walk these aisles barefoot, my steps echoing with the hush of something too ancient to whisper properly. Ahead of me floats a shimmering thread — thin, silver, pulsing ever so faintly — leading me forward. I know without knowing that this is my path, and I follow it with a gut's instinct, my pulse syncing with the clocks above.

Suddenly the dream shifts like a leaf caught in wind: I'm standing in a room that mirrors one in my past — where I once sat beside someone I loved, held their hands and swore, "always." The inside of my mind has grown vivacious and traitorous, replaying a memory — or perhaps a premonition — with haunting clarity.

There she is. Her face half-hidden behind a curtain of smoky incense breath. Not herself, not quite. Her voice comes slow honey — sweet, thick, and suffocating.

> "This is how it needs to be," she says, a waver across her words like a mirage in heat.

I feel it now — the subtle manipulation, a quiet corrosion nestled inside what once was trust. Poison priested under the skin of kindness. Restriction in the name of devotion. Her love no longer a river, but a net.

The dream sharpens.

She tells me she's all there is, the only compass, the only anchor in my floating world. That I fear chaos because I need guidance — because I am nothing without guidance. I blink and the air turns heavier, the mirrored walls now showing not reflections, but distortions: a me who has stopped evolving, who threw away his choices in silent offerings to her.

I feel the dread coiling low, like a spider making its home in the quietest place. Small comments, gestures. Faint bruising emotional, not physical. A tone that stings but doesn't raise welts. All of it dressed in silver-layered concern.

But dreams grow teeth.

In my chest, a heat builds — a slow-burning ember of defiance. I feel the mirror images shiver as I raise my gaze, my voice emerging grounded and echoing against metal.

> "This love is a sculptor," I say, the truth slicing through the haze. "And I am its clay. But clay learns to crack when pressed too often. I will not remain still forever."

The room trembles. The tessellated floor beneath us separates, reality shattering into shards that drift into indigo mist.

She reaches for me — not with hands, but language.

> "You’ll ruin it."

> "Without me, you won’t make it."

But now the choice is me. Now! I’m dreaming, yes — but here, in the spaces carved open by soul and stars, I am not afraid. Voices merge from echoes of those I know, real and imagined, saying things twisted but true:

_“They gaslight under a halo of devotion.”_  
_“They give light so you can’t see where the shadows are drawn.”_  
_“Be real, to yourself — even if it drowns the echo of them."_

Tears well in the corners of my eyes — but this is the dream, and they are not weakness. They burn clean-purpose tears. Revolutionary tears.

I let go.

The cathedral-clockwork collapses like sand in the tide, the dream folding into itself, and in that final instant, that heart-deep beat before waking—

I’m standing alone beneath a velvet sky, wounds real but healing, and in front of me rises a path born in light I remember but never saw reflected back — my own.  

And I follow it.

And I know — I am awake enough to choose truth.  
Even in dreams, especially in dreams.  
Only that dream is real which tells us who we are before anyone else ever tried to name us.
