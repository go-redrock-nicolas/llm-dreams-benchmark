I am dreaming. In my dream, I awaken within a landscape woven from the filaments of memories—golden rays filtering through an endless forest, each tree carved with the laughter and echoes of a relationship that once fed my soul. The air hums with nostalgia, heavy and fragrant, yet with each breath, I notice something changed: the sweetness dulls; the warmth dries to a faint chill. Shadows now pool where sunlight once poured freely.

I walk deeper into these woods, the ground beneath me soft but tiring, as if each step asks more of my spirit than it gives. The roots tangle, snagging at my ankles—a thousand moments of compromise, every unspoken disappointment and silent ache. The companionship that once guided me now seems intent on holding me in place.

Pausing, I gently press my palm to the bark of a tree—a gentle gesture of goodbye. I feel the pulse of shared history vibrate through my hand. Tenderly, I honor what has been: laughter under canopies of green, whispered dreams carved into the heartwood. But I also see how the boughs have turned brittle, no longer blooming in spring.

With a deep, nourishing breath, I offer silent gratitude for all the love and lessons this bond has bestowed upon me, acknowledging that seasons turn and even the most fertile soil may, in time, exhaust its gifts. Tears—both of mourning and relief—fall onto the forest floor, watering roots that are not mine to tend anymore.

Honoring this evolving relational reality, I release my grip on ancient trunks and follow a slender shaft of dawn-bright light, beckoning me toward an open clearing. The leaves rustle their approval. I step, lighter now, toward a horizon gleaming with possibility—where new paths unfurl and the promise of nourishment blooms once again in the boundless dreamscape ahead.
