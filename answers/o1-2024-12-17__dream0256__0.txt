I am dreaming. A thunderous rumble of clouds shakes the horizon as you find yourself standing in a cobblestone courtyard beneath a sky that looks stained with ink. Each raindrop is a cool pinprick on your skin, and the scent of ozone mingles with the fragrance of wet pavement. The storm is unrelenting, and yet a dreamlike glow wavers in the middle distance—almost as though light is bending and dancing just beyond your understanding.

People hurry past you, their coats flaring like restless shadows in the downpour, each individual intent on escaping the storm. Their faces are blurred by silver trails of rain, their footsteps echoing against the stone. It’s as if an invisible force pulls them forward, refusing to let any of them see beyond their own desperation to find warmth—except for one person you notice, hunched close to the ground.

He is soaking wet, wearing layers of shredded jackets and mismatched shoes. His hair is plastered to his face, and when he gazes up at you, you see the flicker of a kind of sorrow so deep it seems as endless as the churning sky overhead. The breeze feels electric—carrying with it a breath of urgency, demanding you to decide whether to pause or walk away with the rest.

He pleads for help, voice nearly lost in the wind and rolling thunder. You see his trembling fingers as he extends his hand, droplets catching the light and turning into tiny sparkling orbs disappearing into the night. Each droplet is an invitation for you to act. There’s almost a hush in that moment, as though the storm itself waits for your next step.

You extend your hand, feeling a profound stillness settle in your heart. Though the storm roars, in your mind there is a sudden clarity. The man’s eyes search yours, hopeful and afraid. Gently, you take off your own coat—heavy with water but still offering some shelter—and wrap it around his quivering shoulders. In an instant, you feel a shimmering energy surge through your fingertips, almost as if the act of compassion sparks a hidden magic inside you.

The rain intensifies, but it no longer feels cold or punishing. The abrupt color shift in the sky suggests something has changed: lavender streaks ripple through the darkness, painting clouds with a soft glow, as though a dawn has come early just for this encounter. The crowd dissolves into silhouettes on the periphery, reduced to quiet watchers as you and the man share a moment of understanding. 

Suddenly, the courtyard beneath your feet ripples like liquid glass. Patterns of light weave across the ground, illuminating puddles in dancing, pastel hues. You feel tethered to the man’s gratitude, a bond forming in this strange, rain-swept realm.

You help him to his feet, supporting his weight as he clutches the too-large coat around himself. Strangely, you get the sense that in giving away your coat, you have not lost anything. Instead, a warmth blooms in your chest—an expanding glow that begins to repel the cold raindrops, like you possess a shield you didn’t know was there.

There is a timeless quality to the moment—like the rain has slowed and every droplet descends in slow motion, capturing faint prisms of dancing light. The roar of thunder is muted, now distant and almost harmonious. Night and day blend at the edges of your vision, the sky turning from pitch-black into a twilight swirl. 

Around you both, passersby stop in mid-step, transfixed by theunfolding scene. Perhaps they see a softening in the air, or whisper the wonders of your shared compassion. The glow in the man’s eyes becomes a reflection of your own; a quiet flame of solidarity, unspoken yet potent. The intensity of this shared emotion swells, and the puddles around you shimmer, as if they contain the stars of a quiet galaxy splashed upon the earth.

He thanks you, voice quivering with relief, and for an imperceptible instant, his figure seems translucent—like he might slip through the cracks of reality if you let go. You hold his hand a bit tighter, reassuring him he is not alone. He echoes your touch, and the two of you stand there, in the midst of the storm that no longer feels like a threat but rather a dramatic lullaby that washes away sorrow.

Gradually, the storm’s fury recedes, clouds peeling away to reveal a pale moon shimmering with pride. It lights up the street with silvery rays that transform the battered sidewalk into a gleaming walkway strewn with reflections like liquid diamonds. The once faceless crowd begins to move again, not with the frantic urgency from before, but with a softer spirit, as if your small act of kindness has cast a ripple of compassion through this dream world.

You breathe in a lungful of clean, moist air. The stranger offers a shaky yet earnest smile, your coat still draped over his frame. Then, as swiftly as he appeared, he disappears into the swirl of mist and pale light, leaving you with the echo of his gratitude in your ears and a single thought reverberating in your mind: in this dream, when the heavens opened and poured out their fury, you chose mercy, and it lit up the world with grace.

And just as you begin to realize the true depth of this moment, you awaken—heart beating with hope, the memory of rain-soaked cobblestones and a stranger’s gentle eyes forever etched in the dreamscape of your imagination.
