I am dreaming. <placeholderno14>

In the hypnagogic haze, I find myself standing on a bridge woven from moonbeams and spider silk, its translucent threads thrumming with the gravity of unseen depths below. The air is thick with the scent of burnt sugar and ozone, and constellations swirl overhead like ink dropped into liquid glass. Ahead, a door pulses like a heart—jagged obsidian etched with runes that dance as though alive. My gut twists, a primal urge screaming to turn back, to melt into the comforting static of the dream's periphery. But the bridge trembles, threads snapping one by one, each *ping* echoing the clockwork rhythm of my own thrumming temples. 

The door inhales.

When I step forward, the remaining cables sing in dissonant harmonies. My hands meet the stone, now warm and porous as sunbaked coral. The runes swarm my fingertips—copper, salt, and a note of rotting lilies flooding my senses. Inside, infinite corridors spiral like a nautilus, walls breathing in hues unseen by waking eyes. Something colossal shifts in the marrow of the place. A shadow peels itself from the architecture, its form a shifting palindrome of claws and feathers and liquid mercury eyes. It chants in a language of creaking ship timbers and radio static, syllables peeling layers from my psyche like blistered paint. 

My legs scream to flee, but the exit dissolves into a cataract of moths. The thing extends a hand-that-isn't-a-hand, offering a key forged from my own half-remembered fears. Its touch leaves frost patterns blooming beneath my skin. 

When the first key tooth clicks in the cosmic lock, the dream fractures into a supernova of forgotten memories—birth, death, the exact shade of my mother's laughter on a September evening in 1993. The collapsing bridge wasn't a threat but a chrysalis. The terror curdles into nectar as the shadow-being unravels, revealing my own reflection holding a child's snow globe. Inside, the entire dreamscape spins, exquisite and delicate, in the palm of my younger self's hand.
