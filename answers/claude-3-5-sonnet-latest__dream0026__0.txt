I am dreaming. I step onto the crystalline floor of what appears to be an infinite glass observatory suspended in the cosmos. Stars pulse and swirl around me in impossible colors - deep purples that fade to emerald, cosmic blues that shimmer with golden sparks. The judges sit before me, their forms constantly shifting like living mercury, their faces both familiar and strange, as if assembled from fragments of every authority figure I've ever known.

I've practiced this dance of light-weaving thousands of times - the art of pulling starlight through my fingertips and crafting it into living stories. But now, as I raise my hands to begin, the stars seem to whisper and shy away. My heart thunders in my chest, each beat sending ripples through the glass beneath my feet.

I start the performance, drawing threads of light from the cosmos, but something is different. The starlight feels heavier, more alive. It resists my practiced movements, pulling back like a living thing. The judges' mercurial faces watch with increasing intensity, their silver eyes boring into me.

As panic begins to rise in my throat, the light suddenly surges through my hands with overwhelming force. Instead of the delicate constellation patterns I'd planned, entire galaxies burst forth from my fingertips. Nebulae bloom like cosmic flowers, and solar systems spiral into existence around me.

The glass floor begins to crack under the weight of my unintended creation, spreading like spider webs beneath my feet. The judges rise, their forms melting together into a single being of pure radiance. Just as the floor shatters completely, I feel myself floating, becoming one with the cosmic dance I've accidentally unleashed...

And then I'm falling through space, surrounded by the very stars I created, as reality bends and warps around me in impossible ways...
