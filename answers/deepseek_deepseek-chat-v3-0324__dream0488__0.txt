I am dreaming. An indigo dusk settles over a city I’ve never seen, but somehow know. The streets are paved with polished silver, reflecting an aurora borealis that dances in slow, liquid ripples above. Each step I take sends soft, resonant echoes humming through the air, as if the ground itself is singing. The buildings are alive—shifting, reshaping—their surfaces etched with glowing symbols that ripple like schools of luminous fish beneath dark water.  

As I speak, my words don’t just leave my lips; they hover before me, pulsing with color and weight. The sky trembles when I whisper, **"soften,"** and the edges of the world blur into watercolor, the breeze sighing like a contented lover. When I murmur, **"burn,"** the stars flicker hungrily, tongues of violet flame licking at the edges of the horizon.  

Something shifts inside me. I realize with startling clarity that my voice is not just sound—it’s stitching reality. A stray thought—*I want to see them*—and suddenly, the shadows detach from the walls, forming into shapes. People? No, not quite. Elegant figures woven from twilight and memory, their faces shifting like reflections in disturbed water. One reaches for me.  

"Who are you?" I ask, and the question expands between us, a golden thread unraveling into the infinite.  

The being tilts its head. **"You named us. Don’t you remember?"**  

The dream deepens. I exhale the word **"remember,"** and the city fractures—suddenly I’m standing in a meadow under twin moons, the grass singing beneath my bare feet. The air tastes like honeysuckle and lightning.  

I understand now: the dream isn’t happening *to* me. I’m dreaming it *into* existence.  

So I smile and whisper the most dangerous word of all—  

**"More."**
