I am dreaming. It's a vivid and unusual dream. I feel the air buzzing with anticipation as I stand before a shimmering obsidian monolith half-sunken into a lake of liquid mercury. The water reflects not my face but flickering scenes of cities under glass domes, their spires piercing storm-clouds that never release their rain. My shoes, impractically delicate lace-ups, sink soundlessly into the spongy earth that smells like petrichor and burnt sugar. 

A voice like wind through reeds speaks without words: *You are the Keeper of the Threshold here, but that doesn't mean you understand your role.* The obsidian slab before me pulses rhythmically, its surface alive with circuits that glow faintly blue. When I touch it, thousands of voices surge into my mind—some pleading, others accusatory—all tied to unfinished projects. A holographic timeline materializes above the monolith, showing cascading red lines labeled "Abandoned" branching out like veins. 

I realize my team isn't just quitting; they’re dissolving into the metallic lake, their forms dissolving into silver mist that rises as data streams into the monolith. Their final words hover in the air around me: *“The Code won’t compile,” “We built shortcuts here,” “The Foundation’s unstable,” “You chose the wrong map.”*

The ground begins to quiver. The monolith’s pulse grows erratic. I notice a toolbelt materialize on my hip—achronogear wrench, a fractal scalpel, tangles of luminous wire. A new voice cuts through the noise, sharp and urgent: *Shift priorities. Reconfigure. But remember—the threshold can’t be crossed until every diverging thread converges. Time doesn’t bend here. It fractures.*

I grasp the wrench, feeling its cold weight, and strike a glowing knot at the base of the monolith. Time shards spray outward, each a crystalline sliver showing potential futures: one where Iabdicate responsibility and drown in mercury, another where I seize control and become the new monolith, and a third where... something shifts in the peripheral vision. A figure emerges from the mist, not a team-member but a stranger with irises like swirling nebulas. 

They speak in a tongue I instinctively understand: *Completion requires sacrifice, but not of yourself. Find the unbroken thread.* Their form dissolves into starlight, leaving a single metallic feather. Touching the feather to the monolith, it etches a glowing cipher into the surface. The hologram recalibrates—now green pathways emerge among the red, tracing connections between abandoned projects. 

The ground lurches again. The lake’s mercury begins rushing toward me, hissing as it forms a staircase leading upward to a prismatic sky-arch above. The monolith splits open, revealing a core of swirling blackholes and white stars. I reach inside, plunging my arm up to the shoulder, and pull out a key forged from solidified time. 

When I turn, the dissolving team-mists are solidifying into translucent figures holding half-finished schematics. The feather’s cipher pulses in sync with their gestures. Together we—stranger, mists, myself—weave the key into the monolith’s heart. The fractures seal. 

The dream ends as the obsidian monolith becomes a bridge, connecting to a city built on the back of a enormous, slumbering dragon whose scales are shifting constellations. I wake, fingers brushing something invisible and cold... and my clock says “Project deadline: 14hrs remaining”.
