I am dreaming. …step through a door that wasn’t there a moment ago, and suddenly you recognize the impossible logic of dreams: you’re moving and standing still at once.

At first, everything is slow, syrup-slow. A single droplet of water falls from a leaf overhead, stretching into a glimmering filament that takes what feels like an hour to break loose. You watch it descend in languid spirals. Each microscopic shimmer on its surface is a separate universe of reflection—miniature sunsets, inverted cities, faces you don’t recognize.

Time, here, is thick and heavy because you are only vaguely interested in this forest. Your senses are half-awake. A thought drifts across your mind—“What would happen if I cared?”—and instantly the world quickens.

Your curiosity ignites, and the scene flares into motion. Leaves rustle with sudden urgency, and the droplet finally splashes against the moss, no longer an endless ballet. A path the color of twilight spreads ahead, paved with clock faces whose hands race forward when you take a step and freeze again when you pause. Each tick is a heartbeat; each beat is a catapult. You kneel to examine one dial more closely, and because your attention narrows to the tiny gears inside, everything else slows to a crawl. The wind becomes a single drawn-out note; birds hover mid-wingbeat like living constellations pinned to the sky.

You stand, decide to test the limits. You sprint.

Engagement floods you, and the dream flips its polarity. Now seconds detonate into fireworks. You fly between trees that melt into streams of neon, feeling your body invert gravity, running across the underside of a bridge that forms from starlight. Entire conversations with unseen companions happen in the space between two strides. You hear laughter, finish a story, and receive an answer all in half a heartbeat. The scenery can’t keep up; it smears into watercolor ribbons, and your mind fills in whatever your momentum demands—a city, a desert, the inside of an hourglass tall as a mountain.

Then fascination peaks. You burst through a curtain of wind, skid to a halt in a vast circular chamber. Suspended above you is an orrery of moons, each inscribed with glowing glyphs. When you look at one globe, you experience an entire afternoon on an alien beach; glance at another, and you live an instant of being a falling snowflake in slow motion. By shifting your gaze, you toggle between epoch and eye-blink, like turning the pages of time’s own scrapbook.

A hush settles as you lie on your back, letting the moons revolve. With no urgent question to pursue, your engagement ebbs, and minutes become tar again. You feel yourself sinking—no, not physically, temporally—into a viscous pool where every pulse drags out. In that syrupy stillness, you notice the smallest things: a faint hum from the orrery’s clockwork, the warmth of ancient sunlight stored in the stone floor, the subtle sweetness of air that tastes like remembered honeysuckle.

Curiosity stirs once more, gentle but focused. You wonder, “Can I hold both speeds at once?” The chamber splits. On the left, time races: lightning storms blossom and extinguish in the blink of an eye. On the right, time lingers: single raindrops hang mid-air like glass beads. You stand astride the seam, feeling each half tug at you—a dual metronome beating fast and slow together. For a breathtaking moment, you perceive all tempos simultaneously: eons as heartbeats, heartbeats as eons. You sense that outside the dream, your sleeping body might be twitching through REM cycles or lying quiet as stone, yet here you are the maestro of minutes, the sculptor of seconds.

Satisfied, you close your eyes inside the dream. Everything compresses into a pearl of white noise, then unfurls again—a sunrise collapsing and re-expanding—until you’re resting back on that mossy forest floor where it all began. The droplet that started to fall finally kisses the ground.

And just as the ripple spreads across the moss, you feel a gentle nudge from the waking world—a hint of dawn light against your eyelids, the whisper of real-world time ready to reclaim its usual pacing.

But for one final beat, you linger in the in-between, carrying with you the memory that time is not a ruler but clay, forever soft in the heat of your attention.
