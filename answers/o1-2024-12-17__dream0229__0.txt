I am dreaming. The world around you seems to pulse with a quiet, glass-like hum—at once mesmerizing and unsettling. A turquoise sky, laced with subtly shifting clouds shaped like colossal, slow-moving creatures, stretches above an endless landscape. It feels as though the horizon is melting, draped with the shimmering gleam of an otherworldly light. This is the kingdom where you find yourself: a society that has discovered the means of removing every trace of suffering from the individual mind.

As you wander through the smooth streets made from a translucent, coral-like material, you notice that the structures surrounding you are neither purely organic nor entirely artificial. The buildings shimmer with the faint suggestion of veins, as though they are alive—or perhaps were once alive and have been crystallized in time. The air is sweet, reminiscent of sugared flowers in early spring, but each breath feels thick with the weight of secrets. 

People here drift by serenely, faces radiant with soft smiles and tranquil eyes. Nobody seems rushed. Their clothing flows in gentle waves, as though animated by invisible currents of breeze. Every person who meets your gaze does so with a silent invitation, a subtle tilt of the head that implies a curiosity both gentle and intense. It occurs to you that no one here blinks in confusion or frustration—no sign of fear or anger. Instead, each being seems enveloped by a consistent, unwavering calm.

Eventually, someone steps forward: a tall, graceful figure with hair reminiscent of gilded vines. Their presence is magnetic, and the corners of their mouth curl up into an almost celestial smile. They explain, in a voice so melodious that it feels like listening to the hush of a distant choir, that their civilization has transcended the need for suffering by extracting it from each individual’s psyche. The capability for pain—physical, mental, emotional—does not exist anymore. The reality they inhabit is shaped by perpetual harmony, free from sorrow or conflict.

Yet you sense a hidden cost, an almost inaudible dissonance woven into the environment. Although no one is angry or afraid, there is also something missing. It feels as though you’ve walked into a forest that looks lush and green but lacks the music of birds, the scurrying of small creatures: life is still and eerily pristine.

They invite you to integrate fully. To surrender your capacity to suffer by allowing them to remove it entirely—embodying the pure bliss that glimmers around you in every face. But as you stand in the soft light of this utopia, you can’t quite ignore a whispering doubt in your mind. Part of you wonders: If they remove suffering, what else is quietly extracted along with it? Does losing pain also diminish empathy, creativity—the beautiful chaos that births new ideas? Are the dark shadows inside each soul also the rich soil where compassion and growth first take root?

One by one, members of this society drift closer. Their open yet somehow vacant smiles pull at your heart. They promise you that you will finally be free, unshackled by every torment that has ever haunted you. They reassure you that no sacrifice is too great for endless peace. Yet your stomach tightens like a coiled spring. Something about their serenity feels almost too perfect, too sterile—like a painting with a wide swath of color gently missing.

You glance at your hands. They look the same, but the lines in your palms appear to swirl and shift, as though the fate they hold is in flux. Sympathetic, luminous eyes lock onto yours, and for a moment, you sense that the entire collective is gazing at you through this one emissary’s face. Their mind beckons, saying there is no turning back from this point. You can either move forward and embrace a life without tears or retreat, carrying your doubts into a different future.

Your heart quivers with a thousand unasked questions. As you weigh your next step, the sounds of your own breath and the faint rustling of your clothing reverberate in the otherwise silent city. The smooth path under your feet feels warm, pulsing like a silent heartbeat. You sense that this decision—whether to transcend pain entirely or bear the burden of your own complex humanity—may define more than just your own destiny.

Timidly, you look once more into those captivating eyes, half-wondering if you can truly remember what sorrow feels like compared to this surreal hush. The hush that promises no tears, but perhaps offers no laughter born from real triumph either. You lift your chin, and despite the sweet, intoxicating aroma filling your lungs, you speak the truth of your own soul, wavering on the precipice of a decision that asks you to either claim or deny all the shadowy corners which make you who you are.

And the dream, like the quiet breath of wind on still water, holds its breath, waiting to hear your choice.
