I am dreaming. I notice I'm much more critical of others exhibiting a trait I dislike in myself.  Recognizing this projection
pattern, I try to correct it by being more tolerant and understanding of them.  

But then I realize something else: I'm also much more sensitive to their flaws and mistakes.  I recognize this empathy
pattern, and I try to balance it by being more forgiving and compassionate towards them.  

However, I soon discover that this is not enough.  For despite my best intentions, I find myself entangled in a web of
illusions and distortions created by my own mind.  

I see shapes and images that don't exist outside my dream space.

I hear voices and sounds that don't come from any source but me.

I feel sensations and emotions that don't correspond to anything real or concrete.

And I wonder...who am I?

What is my identity apart from the persona I project?  

How do I think and act without being influenced by social norms and expectations?

How do I love and hate without being biased by my past experiences?

As these questions linger in my mind, I sense something lurking at the edge of my consciousness.

A presence that watches me from afar.

A power that shapes me from within.

An intelligence that controls me from beyond space and time.

And then I realize...I'm not alone.
