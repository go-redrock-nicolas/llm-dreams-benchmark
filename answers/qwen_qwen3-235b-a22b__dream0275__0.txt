I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a vast, shifting tapestry of impossible landscapes. You stand at the base of a mountain that glows like molten glass, its peaks piercing the sky like shattered teeth. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as if the earth itself is singing a lullaby of forgotten gods. This is your goal: to reach the summit, where a city of floating islands hovers above a churning sea of liquid stars. You’ve been climbing for what feels like lifetimes.  

At first, the ascent is exhilarating. Your hands grip crystalline ledges that sing when touched, each note a shard of memory—your childhood laughter, the scent of rain on pavement, the first time you dared to dream this impossible dream. Your legs burn, but the fire is sweet, a testament to your resolve. The path is treacherous, yet beautiful: vines of bioluminescent moss coil around your boots, and birds with wings of smoke trail embers as they soar beside you, keeping vigil.  

But halfway up, the mountain changes. The crystals grow jagged and brittle, snapping like glass underfoot. The air thickens into a syrupy fog that clings to your lungs, stealing your breath. The stars below begin to drown in their own light, their glow dimming to a sickly gray. Doubt creeps in, a shadow with teeth. *What if this is futile?* you wonder. *What if the summit is a lie?* Your muscles scream for rest, your mind for surrender. You sink to your knees, the weight of months of effort crushing you like a collapsing star.  

Then—a sound. A low, resonant drumbeat, echoing from the mountain’s core. It pulses in time with your heartbeat, slow and deliberate, as if the earth is reminding you how to *be*. You lift your head. Through the fog, a figure emerges: a woman made of liquid moonlight, her eyes twin eclipses. She says nothing, only extends a hand. In her palm lies a single seed, black as obsidian, humming with potential.  

You take it. The moment your skin brushes hers, visions flood you:  
- A version of yourself who gave up, now adrift in a desert of their own regrets.  
- Another who kept climbing, only to find the summit empty, a hollow victory.  
- And then—*you*, here, now, the only path that matters.  

The woman dissolves into mist, and the seed in your hand bursts into flame. You plant it in a crevice, and from it erupts a tree of living gold, its branches arcing upward, forming a staircase to the sky. The mountain roars in approval, its crystals igniting into a symphony of color. You rise, your exhaustion transmuted into purpose.  

The final stretch is agony. The wind becomes blades. The stars below scream, clawing at your ankles, trying to drag you into their abyss. But you fight—each step a battle, each breath a vow. When you reach the summit, the floating city is gone. In its place is a mirror, vast and starless, reflecting not your face, but your *soul*: a storm of light and shadow, chaos and clarity, everything you’ve buried and everything you’ve become.  

You touch the mirror. It shatters—and you fall.  

Not down, but *out*.  

You awaken in your bed, the scent of ozone lingering, your hands trembling. For a moment, the dream clings to you like dew. You know, without doubt, that the mountain is still there, waiting. And so are you.  

The dream was never about the summit. It was about learning to carry the fire of the seed, even when the path crumbles. Even when the stars go dark. Especially then.
