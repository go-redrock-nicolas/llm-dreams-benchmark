I am dreaming. I begin in the middle of a vast, glass-roofed transit hall—an echoing cathedral of steel beams, marble floors, and a constant tidal hum of travelers wheeling suitcases across polished stone. Shafts of buttery morning light angle down from the skylights, catching motes of dust that drift like golden snow. I’m simply passing through, nameless among thousands, when the tremor comes.

At first it’s no more than a shiver beneath my shoes, a gentle clink of coffee cups on café saucers. Then the earth lurches sideways, as though some giant hand has slammed the entire station against an invisible wall. In an instant the hall erupts: chandeliers shatter; commuters stumble, lose their grip on phones and briefcases; the grand clock above the ticket booths jangles on its chains, struggling not to fall. A sharp, thunderous CRACK yawns through the rafters—steel screaming against steel—and everyone looks up at once.

Panic blossoms like a wildfire. A chorus of alarms wails. People scatter in every direction, turning the polished floor into a frenzied maze of collisions. Someone shouts, “The mezzanine’s collapsing!”—and sure enough, the upper balcony buckles, spilling suitcases and fragments of railing onto the concourse below. The air fills with dust, plaster, and a metallic tang that prickles the tongue.

My pulse races—yet in that swirling cyclone of movement, I feel something click inside me, as if a secret door in my ribs swings open. The chaos floods my perception, but time itself begins to drip, stretch, and then stall like thick honey. The screams elongate into slow-motion echoes. Shards of glass pause mid-air, glinting like suspended constellations. I realize, with a calm that feels utterly alien, that I’m able to reach out and pluck moments—seconds, heartbeats, fragments of futures—like pearls on an invisible string. I can bend them, splice them, rewind them.

An elderly woman stumbles near a toppled information kiosk; I see, in one possible branch of time, a ceiling beam falling toward her. In the slowed-down world, I step lightly forward, touch the beam with a fingertip, and watch it drift upward instead, rewinding to its origin point. The woman unknowingly steps out of danger and continues on, never realizing her fate has been edited.

All around me I begin stitching a tapestry of salvations: A toddler separated from his father wails beside a cracked marble pillar—rewind, choose a different corridor, and suddenly father and son collide in an embrace they both assume was pure luck. A panicked commuter slips on shattered tiles—pause, shift a rolling suitcase as casually as nudging a chess piece, and now the commuter regains balance, running clear of the crumbling mezzanine.

I test the limits. I rewind farther, glimpsing the moment just before the first tremor. There: a faint rumble beneath the tracks, a hairline fracture racing through a support strut. Load-bearing bolts are already shearing. I try to reinforce them with pure will, but time resists—structures still fatigue, physics still demands tribute. So I compromise: I lengthen every second available for escape. Doors that would slam shut now hesitate. Trains that would depart hang motionless. Announcements rattle from the speakers—“Please proceed to the exits”—drawn out like whalesong while people surge toward daylight in a slow-motion exodus.

Throughout, there’s a sensation of threads slipping through my fingers, each thread a possibility. If I let go, time will snap back, the disaster might resume its natural tempo. My gift feels less like supreme command and more like a delicate negotiation with the universe—an aching tug-of-war between entropy and mercy.

At last, most of the crowd stands outside on the windy plaza, astonished to find themselves unscathed. Sirens approach from distant streets. Inside the station, the ceiling finally completes its surrender and collapses in a muted avalanche that the evacuees only hear as a distant boom. Dust billows through the broken doors like smoke from an extinguished pyre.

I release my hold on time. The world clicks back to its familiar, unstoppable speed. My knees buckle, drained by the effort. Yet as I stagger into the sunlight, I notice an almost imperceptible shimmer around me—a residue of unspent possibilities. It lingers on the air like the aftertaste of lightning, reminding me that the universe can be rewritten, if only for an instant, by the quiet turning of an unseen key.

And then the dream blurs, the edges of buildings melt into watercolor, and I awaken—heart pounding—with the memory of thousands of lives saved by the simple act of borrowing time and giving it back, stitched together moment by moment, like a secret miracle no one will ever quite believe.
