I am dreaming. …draw a single hungry breath, grit your teeth against the dust, and close your eyes.

At once the wreckage around you swims and softens, as though the cracked concrete decides to melt into smoke. In the hush that follows the last rumble, you find yourself curled in a low, vaulted chamber that could never have fit beneath the office floor. The ceiling is an upside-down night sky, its stars tiny shards of fluorescent bulbs still flickering with uncertain electricity. All around, other survivors lie half-buried in shimmering piles of glass that behave more like sand—flowing away as soon as anyone stirs. Someone coughs, the sound echoing like canyon thunder, and you remember that you all still need air.

A narrow shaft of light—no wider than a pencil—drops from somewhere far above. You watch motes of plaster drift through it like lazy fireflies, and a sudden notion strikes: if dust can float toward freedom, so can you. You call out. Your voice quivers at first, then steadies, ricocheting off invisible walls until it sounds like a dozen confidant copies urging the group onward.

“So we climb,” you declare.

A stranger’s hand appears from the gloom—fingers caked in white powder, nails rimed in red brick dust—and clasps your own. Soon more hands emerge, forming a living lattice. In this impossible dream-logic, fear begins to fade, replaced by a quiet awe. You scramble upward, each broken girder bending into a curved branch, each slab of drywall blooming with mossy grip. It is as if the building has decided to become a half-remembered forest—one you might have wandered as a child when your imagination could remake a backyard tree into a citadel.

Your lungs burn, but each breath tastes increasingly like rain on warm pavement rather than suffocating grit. Somewhere below, a faint lullaby rises, sung by someone who shouldn’t know the melody of your grandmother’s wind-up music box, yet here they are, humming it as though coaxing courage from the very air.

Halfway up, a tremor ripples through the structure. The dream tilts. Loose papers flutter out of a crushed filing cabinet and turn into ivory moths, swirling about your head. Panic threatens to rush back, but then the moths settle on jagged edges, their wings glowing. They make a path—an illuminated spine up the wreckage. You keep climbing.

At last, you reach a gap: a ragged window framing a dawn so vivid that sea-shot clouds look painted with molten opal. You haul yourself through. A rooftop garden, absurdly intact, stretches before you—ferns beaded with dew, orange trees shaking off the quake like wet dogs. Survivors pour out behind you, blinking at the sudden abundance of space and sky.

The building groans once more, but this time it sounds like the slow exhale of a leviathan slipping back into calm waters. Below, somewhere in the fractured maze you’ve left, alarms still wail; above, helicopters spin, their rotors chopping the cool morning light into glittering confetti. Yet none of it feels dire anymore. It feels celebratory, as though the world itself wanted to remind you: within rubble can sprout cathedrals made of stars, forests from stairwells, courage from the thin, quivering edge of breath.

You step to the parapet, pulse thrumming in your ears, and know—because dreams can bend rules—that the hardest part is already done. You have climbed through stone and shadow, and dawn has answered. The others gather close, faces smudged but shining. Someone laughs, soft and incredulous. Someone else begins to cry—relief, release, rebirth.

And just before waking, you taste the wind: petrichor, citrus, and something sweetly electric—a promise that even in the quake of ordinary life, hidden passages lead upward, and light is always searching for a place to spill.
