I am dreaming. I am in a place that feels both ancient and futuristic at the same time. There's a giant tree made of crystal glowing with an ethereal light. Its roots twist and spiral into a dark, mysterious cave below. The air hums with energy, and I can hear whispers in a language I can't understand but somehow feel their meaning. A figure approaches me; they're wearing a cloak that shifts colors like oil on water, and their eyes are two different colors—a molten gold and a deep midnight blue. They speak in riddles, challenging me to choose between two paths: one that leads to unimaginable wealth but requires surrendering something sacred, and another that offers wisdom but demands embracing uncertainty. I'm standing at the crossroads, my heart pounding, trying to decide. The ground beneath me begins to shake as shadows dance on the crystal tree's trunk, warning of an impending choice’s gravity.\n
