I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of forgotten lullabies—notes of lavender and burnt honey curling into a mist that clings to my skin like gauze. I stand at the edge of a vast, shifting garden, its paths woven from threads of light that pulse faintly, as though breathing. Each trail spirals outward in a different direction, glowing gold, then silver, then the deep indigo of midnight. My friends are there, but they are not *there*. They walk their own paths, their figures growing smaller with each step, their laughter now a distant chime of bells swallowed by the wind.  

I follow the path of my oldest friend, its stones carved with scenes from summers past—bare feet in creek water, fireflies trapped in mason jars, secrets whispered under blankets. But the trail dissolves beneath my feet into a river of liquid glass, reflecting not my face, but the face of who I might have been: younger, simpler, still tethered to the constellations of our shared childhood. When I look up, my friend is a silhouette now, their form melting into a grove of trees with bark like polished bone. Their voice drifts back, a half-remembered joke, before the trees swallow it whole.  

Another path glows crimson, winding through a forest of frozen orchids. This one belongs to the friend who became an artist, their life a riot of color and chaos. The air here hums with the buzz of unseen bees, and the petals of the orchids drip with paint—scarlet, cobalt, gold. I see them in the distance, dancing with shadows, their hands smearing the horizon into a masterpiece. They don’t turn when I call. Their world is a fever dream of creation, and I am a ghost at its edge.  

The paths multiply. One shimmers like molten copper, leading to a desert where a friend has built a city of sand and mirrors, their ambition rising and collapsing in equal measure. Another twists into a cavern lit by bioluminescent fungi, where a once-loud voice now murmurs philosophy to the roots of the earth. Each divergence feels like a thread unraveling from a tapestry I no longer recognize.  

At the garden’s heart, I find a pool of still water, its surface a mosaic of fractured memories. I kneel and see us there: the group picnics, the sleepless nights, the way we used to braid each other’s hair without asking. The images ripple, then harden into ice. When I touch the pool, it burns—a cold that seeps into my bones, etching the truth: these moments are not lost, but *transformed*, fossils of a love that outgrows its container.  

I wake with the taste of starlight on my tongue, the ache of absence sharp and sweet as a half-healed wound. The dream lingers, a parable of drifting stars and inevitable tides. We are all constellations now, burning in separate skies, yet still part of the same infinite dark.
