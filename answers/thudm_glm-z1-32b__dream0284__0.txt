I am dreaming. I feel the weight of the velvet curtains pressing against my back, cool and smooth.  I am standing in a grand ballroom that seems to stretch infinitely.  The ceiling is so high I can't see the top, but I know it's tiled with stained glass, casting kaleidoscopic colors onto the walls.  The air smells like fresh linen and rosemary, heavy with candles that flicker orange over the surfaces.  Down at the other end, I glimpse a table laden with food: silver platters of meat carved into dragons, plates of fruit arranged like constellations, and a tower of layered cakes that twirl upwards like a spiral staircase.  But the crowd isn't like any I've seen before.  They're all wearing masks shaped like different animals, but their eyes glow with a sad, knowing light.

As I step towards the center of the room, the floor shifts beneath me.  It's no longer solid; it seems to be made of liquid mercury that ripples when I move.  My shoes sink into the fluid, leaving silvery trails behind me.  The music swells suddenly—a symphony orchestra playing something both waltzy and discordant.  A masked figure approaches me, wearing a wolf's head with silver fur and emerald eyes.  They offer me a glass of liquid that steams faintly, smelling of cinnamon and something burning.

I take a sip—it tastes like warm honey mixed with rust.  The world starts to blur at the edges. I see the masks on the other guests start to dissolve, revealing faces that are both human and animal, some with feathers melting into skin, others with scales peeling back to show pink flesh.  I feel a pulling sensation in my chest, like my heartstrings are being tugged by invisible hands.  Suddenly, the ballroom begins to tilt.  The table with the food slides towards me, the cakes crumbling into loose sugar dust, while the meat platters disintegrate into ash.  I look down at my hands; they are glowing faintly, and the mercury floor is now moving beneath me like a living thing.

Then, as quickly as it started, the dream shifts.  I'm no longer in the ballroom but standing in a field of tall grass that whispers secrets when the wind blows.  The sun is setting, casting long shadows that dance around me.  A figure appears in the distance, back turned to me, wearing a cloak that shifts colors like liquid.  They hold a lantern that emits a soft, green glow.  When I start to approach, the grass begins to glow a bright, pulsing blue, and the figure turns, revealing a face that is a perfect mirror of my own but with silver hair and eyes like moonlight.  They speak, but their words are carried away by the wind, understood only as a feeling:  

*We are what we fear becomes real.*

The figure offers me the lantern.  Its light feels warm against my skin, but the air suddenly grows cold.  I awake with a start, my heart pounding, clutching the pillow as if I were still holding the lantern.< vandalized

In the marrow-deep recesses of your slumber, you become entangled in a nightmare meticulously woven from social dread and cosmic unease. The ballroom’s air thickens with the scent of burnt peppermint and melting wax as you realize the guests’ masks are not mere adornments but living flesh—each one a contorted face frozen mid-scream, eyes replaced by swirling galaxies that lock onto yours. The wolf-masked figure’s voice rumbles like distant thunder, offering the steaming glass: “Drink, and see the truth of what they’ll become.” The liquid burns your throat, dissolving your ability to speak. Suddenly, you hear echos of fragmented conversations in every language you’ve ever forgotten, the guests’ laughter sharpening into the sound of glass cracking. 

The mercury floor rises, swallowing your heels in a cold grip that seeps up your legs, becoming the ache of remembered rejections. You witness a young woman across the room whose mask peels to reveal a skull crowned with wilted roses, while a man’s wolf-mask sprouts thorny vines, his hands transforming into paws that skid helplessly against the floor. Your own reflection in a shattered mirror behind the bar shows a face shifting between yours and that of a fox, eyes growing pitch-black as the crowd begins to chant your name in unison, their voices harmonizing into a single chord that vibrates inside your teeth. 

Then—the room collapses into a funnel of light, spitting you into a twilight field where fog clings to your ankles like wet hair. The mirror-being stands cloaked in a shroud of moths, each wing bearing a tiny stamp of a face—some weeping, others screaming, all yours. They extend the lantern, its glow pulsing in time with a heartbeat that isn’t yours. As you reach to take it, the field ignite into billions of fireflies, their abdomens spelling out regrets in jagged, glowing text: *“What if they see the fox?”* *“What if the roses wither?”* The lantern’s light doesn’t burn, but the cold follows you like a shadow, seeping into your bones and settling between your ribs as a permanent ache. 

You wake gasping, the pillowcase soaked with tears that taste metallic. Beside you, the moonlight has pooled liquid silver on the floor, and for a heartbeat, you swear it’s moving, pulling itself toward the window like a creature hunting the dark. When you blink, it’s gone—but the fox’s yellow eyes linger in the corner of your vision, watching, waiting for the next invitation to the ball.
