I am dreaming. It begins as a soft white mist, delicate as milk spilled into the quiet, velvet hush of midnight.  My feet—when did I start walking?—sink gently into a terrain that is neither land nor water, but a perfect liminal shade between both, shimmering with each step into ripples of liquid gemstone.  Sparkling pools widen beneath my soles, carrying echoes, like fragments of past conversations, bouncing and fading as they drift outward.

Above, the sky is not a sky.  It is a shifting aurora of memories—bright, vivid flashes of my favorite childhood mornings, icy loneliness, laughter over dinners that lasted until the sun bled gold into the treetops.  Each memory flickers like a shooting star, drawn across a canvas of twilight, as though these moments are alive—suspended in flight, dancing to the sound of my breath.

But time... oh, how peculiarly time moves here.  Each step I take reignites the world in a cascade of colors.  I scold myself for it—stepping faster, greedy, wanting to see more, see *everything*—but a curious duality unfolds: the faster I walk, the slower I feel. Each vivid second stretches like taffy, drifting into eternity like a single note held impossibly long.  

An old oak tree appears in front of me, its bark wild and alive with threads of glowing silver.  The branches scratch and wave at the air like someone lost in reverie—trying to reach an understanding that stays just out of reach.  I sit beside the tree.*  
I mean to doze only briefly, but as my back presses against its warmth, the world slows even more.  

Suddenly, the air is syrupy, heavy with strange perfume—like jasmine blooming in a cathedral across centuries.  The wind stops altogether.  Colors pulse slower.  I hear the flutters of wings somewhere deep inside the distance, but they never reach me.  Time feels thick now, like syrup-soaked spongecake melting between my fingers.  

And yet, within this syrup of moments, I notice the small things. The way my breath seems to reorder the stars in the misty sky above. A beetle crossing my foot—tiny but deliberate, solemn in its purpose—leaving behind trails that bloom into faint golden fire as it skitters away.  

Engagement, I realize—*attention*—threads time to meaning. When I move with hunger, time expands, drowning me in its vastness. When I slow, rest, focus, it compresses, turning the world into molasses, wrapping me snugly in moments that should have passed too quickly but don’t.  

I stand again, and the dream shifts.

Now, instead of the soft terrain, I find myself running across golden corridors lined with portals. Each door hums softly,
