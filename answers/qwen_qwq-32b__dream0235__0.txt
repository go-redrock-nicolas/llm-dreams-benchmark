I am dreaming. The air is thick with an indigo haze that smells like lavender and static.  Before me stands a dodecahedron made of liquid mercury, its surfaces rippling with bioluminescent glyphs that shift like fish underwater.  An unseen voice instructs me to memorize a sequence of gestures—a code for translating emotion into motion.  My fingers tremble as I trace the first symbol, a spiraling helix that blooms into a crimson flower in the air when completed.  

When I wake, I find myself backstage at an opera house where performers wear masks that change color with their heartbeats.  The stage manager, a woman with hair like living ivy, places a matching mask on my face and hands me a script written in scent: lavender for sorrow, cinnamon for joy.  As I step onto the stage, the audience’s collective breath becomes a tangible current.  

Mid-performance, the masks malfunction.  Mine fractures, spilling a chorus of blackbirds whose wings hum Morse code interpretations of Rumi’s poetry.  The crowd sighs in unison, their faces rearranging into symmetrical petaled shapes as they assimilate the chaos.  We bow, not to the audience, but to the electric silence between heartbeats.
