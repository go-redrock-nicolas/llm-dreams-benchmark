I am dreaming. 

The moment my fingertips brush against the emerald leaves of the ancient oak in my backyard, a shockwave of vibrant energy courses through me—as if I've been plunged into a river of liquid starlight. The world tilts, then dissolves into fractals of color. Suddenly, I *hear them*. Not with my ears, but through my skin, my bones—a slow, vegetal symphony of rustling secrets. 

The oak’s voice is deep and resonant, its words unfurling like roots through time: *"Little awake-one, you’ve finally tuned your frequency to the Green Hum."* Around me, daisies giggle in high-pitched, sun-warmed trills, their petals quivering with gossip about bees that linger too long. The ivy on the fence murmurs in layered whispers about the weight of moonlight on its leaves. And the roses—oh, the roses—sing in thorn-sharp harmonies of passion and protection, recounting every stolen kiss their blooms have witnessed over centuries.

I kneel, pressing my palm to the soil, and the mycelial network beneath screams—no, *sings*—an electric hymn of connection. Mushrooms pulse indigo with bioluminescent laughter as they translate between grass-blade haikus and the oak’s slow, sagely proverbs. A dandelion chuckles as it recounts how it tricked a child into making a wish, its seeds spiraling into the air like golden fireworks carrying dreams. 

Then—silence. The plants stiffen. **She** approaches. The compost pile at the garden’s edge exhales a plume of shimmering spores, and from it steps a figure woven from vines and decay: the Queen of Rot, her crown a twisting helix of murmuring fungi. *"They called us mute for millennia,"* she hisses, her voice the sound of bark splitting in frost. *"Now you will hear our chorus… and our warning."* 

The dream shudders as a thousand plant voices rise as one—an emerald tsunami of stories, demands, and the terrible, beautiful weight of photosynthesis shaping worlds. I wake gasping, my skin buzzing with chlorophyll and prophecy, my ears ringing with the last words of the oak: *"The roots remember everything."* 

( What happens next? Do you share this revelation with the world? Or do the plants demand silence?)
