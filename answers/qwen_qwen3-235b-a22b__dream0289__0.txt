I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The sky is a bruise of swirling indigo and ash, split by a sun that hangs like a dying ember, its light too weak to warm the earth below. You stand at the edge of a city that is not a city—its towers are made of crumbling paper, its streets paved with shattered mirrors that reflect a thousand versions of yourself, each one weeping silently. The air smells of burnt lavender and salt, a scent that tangles in your throat, sharp and familiar. You know, without knowing how, that someone you love—someone vital—has vanished. Their absence is a hollow in your ribs, a vacuum that pulls at your breath. You scream their name, but the sound dissolves into the wind, which carries whispers in languages you once spoke but have forgotten.  

A river appears beneath your feet, though you didn’t see it rise. It is not water but a torrent of old photographs, letters, and half-remembered moments, swirling like ink. You wade in, the current tugging at your ankles, and the images brush against your skin: a birthday candle’s flicker, a hand slipping from yours, a door left ajar in the dark. You dive under, desperate to grasp something solid, and the river swallows you whole.  

You emerge into a forest where the trees are made of bone, their branches clawing at the sky as if begging for mercy. The ground squelches with every step, and fireflies glow not with light but with tiny, screaming faces. You follow them, compelled, until you reach a clearing where a house floats upside-down, its roots reaching skyward like desperate fingers. Inside, you find a version of yourself sitting at a table, face obscured, eating a meal of shadows and thorns. They do not look up. “You’re too late,” they say, their voice the sound of a door slamming shut.  

But then—a flicker. A moth the size of a child drifts down, its wings etched with constellations. It lands on your palm, and suddenly you’re elsewhere: a beach where the waves are made of glass, shattering and reforming with each heartbeat. On the horizon, a figure stands, their silhouette frayed at the edges. You run toward them, the shards slicing your feet, but the distance never shortens. Still, you run.  

The dream fractures. You are now a child again, clutching a paper lantern that pulses like a wounded heart. The sky above is stitched with golden thread, and somewhere, a lullaby plays on a loop, warped and crackling. You follow the music to a garden where flowers bloom into tiny human faces, their petals whispering secrets you can’t quite hear. One reaches out, presses its cheek to yours, and dissolves into rain.  

When you wake, your cheeks are wet. The dream clings to you like smoke, its edges blurred but its ache razor-sharp. You cannot remember if the figure on the glass shore was real or a phantom, or if the lantern’s light was yours all along. But in your chest, beneath the hollow, there is a flicker—small, defiant, and burning.
