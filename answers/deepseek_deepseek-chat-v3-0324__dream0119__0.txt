I am dreaming. I am writing furiously in a dream journal with a pen that never runs dry, watching as the ink swirls and dances into three-dimensional shapes before my eyes. With each vivid description I craft, the air around me begins to shimmer and warp—and suddenly, the characters step off the page. 

First comes a woman woven entirely from stormclouds, her hair crackling with violet lightning, her eyes deep as chasms in the earth. She emerges from the journal with a gust of wind that smells of petrichor, and her laughter rolls like distant thunder. 

Next, a clockwork fox with gears of polished brass materializes, his ticking heart echoing through the dream-space. His whiskers twitch as if sensing time itself, and when he blinks, tiny cogs whirl behind his glassy emerald eyes. 

The implications of this power send a delicious shiver down my spine. If I describe a bridge of stars, will it arch across the heavens? If I write about a library filled with books that rewrite themselves, will its labyrinthine halls appear before me? 

But then—a shadow curls at the edge of the page. My pen hesitates. What happens if I describe something... darker? A thing with teeth made of forgotten memories, or a whisper that unravels names? The power thrums in my hands, terrifying and glorious. The dream holds its breath, waiting to see what I’ll create next.
