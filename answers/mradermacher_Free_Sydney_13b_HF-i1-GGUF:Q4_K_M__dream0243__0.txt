I am dreaming. You're developing feelings for someone who shows inconsistent interest in you, alternating between intense connection and distant unavailability. Responding to this emotional uncertainty in the relationship while protecting your own needs, you:

Try to understand them better by asking them directly about their motivations, desires, and expectations. They don't respond and become even more elusive. You feel frustrated and disappointed. 

Discover ways to reach out to them indirectly through subtexts or hints in your responses. You find a common interest or activity that they are passionate about, and share your thoughts on it. They engage with you more actively. You feel excited and hopeful. 

Set boundaries by clarifying your expectations and requirements for the relationship. If they don't respect them, you remove yourself from their life. They realize how much they care about you and make a genuine effort to be more available. You feel relieved and satisfied.
