I am dreaming. I twitch, my pillow suddenly becoming as hard as a boulder. Sweltering, suffocating heat wraps around me like wet, leaden blankets. Sweat beads on my forehead and trickles down, but the warmth remains unrelenting. Then suddenly, frosty fingers caress my skin, leaving goosebumps in their wake. I shiver, but then the heat returns, followed by the chilly air. This cycle continues as I fight to find a simple night's rest.
