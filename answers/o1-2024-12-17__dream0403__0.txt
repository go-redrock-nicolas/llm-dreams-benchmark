I am dreaming. I awaken—if such a word can apply in a dream—on a windswept plateau made of smooth glass that refracts the moonlight into a thousand shimmering prisms of color. There is no sky above, only a vast expanse of swirling auroras that flicker and twist like serpents of liquid light. It’s as though night and day have become painter’s oils, mixing in broad, bold strokes overhead to form a cosmic tapestry.

I’m in the center of this place, trying to keep my balance on the slick surface beneath my feet. And yet, I barely notice the precarious footing because my attention is consumed by a single thought: someone I love—an old friend, a companion, perhaps a mentor—has brushed me aside, or so I believe. In the dream, I can’t recall the exact words they said or the moment it happened, but my heart feels bruised and resentful, as though stung by an unseen wasp.

This fixated thought is so powerful that it births a small storm around me. Tiny shards of glass begin to crack free from the plateau, rising into the air to form a swirling halo of glittering shards. They circle me like anxious satellites, reflecting my sense of hurt and pride. I see my own vexed face mirrored on their prismatic surfaces, the reflection fractured into infinite fragments, each one silently screaming the slight over and over.

As I stand there, the beauty of this dreamscape grows overshadowed by my brooding. I notice my posture wilting under the weight of bitterness. My shoulders slump under an invisible burden. Something within me—a clearer, steadier part of my consciousness—nudges me to look beyond my swirling shards, urging me to see the effect this rumination has on my mind and spirit.

I feel my chest tighten. The shimmering shards begin to spin faster, intensifying the storm around me. My reflection fractures further into restless shards of color, all echoing frustration and fear of disrespect. But as I stand there, locked in this anxious swirl, I sense a calm stirring deep inside, a small but persistent glow.

On an impulse, I raise my arms out wide, as if embracing the night sky, and take a deep breath. That gentler glow in my chest expands. Almost instantly, the whirling halo quivers and slows, and the countless mirrored fragments begin to merge, coalescing into a single, polished orb of golden light.

My mind quiets, and the howling wind subsides. The glass beneath me grows more stable, less slippery, as though it too finds equilibrium in my tranquility. I hold the orb in my hands—it’s warm and comforting, a tangible manifestation of my decision to step away from the spiral of hurt. When I peer into the orb, I see the face of the person who slighted me; only now, it shows them as a nuanced being, not a caricature of wrongdoing. I see their tenderness blend with their flaws, their sincerity mixed with the unintentional barb that left me hurt. Somehow, witnessing their complexity helps me let go of the misdeed.

With this release, I see the rest of the plateau awaken in a surge of luminous color. The entire expanse resonates with gentle hums and pulses, as if breathing in harmony with me. I feel lighter, more awake to the dream’s mysteries. The sense of betrayal or slight no longer lords over my thoughts. Indeed, the golden orb flutters from my palm and dissolves into an iridescent cloud, drifting upward to join the dancing auroras above.

Now that the tension in my heart recedes, I notice a majestic shape rising on the horizon: a gargantuan crystal tree sprouting from the glass. Its trunk glitters with faint pastel hues, and its branches stretch high, each length bearing countless leaves spun from the filigree of starlight. Enticed by its beauty, I walk toward this tree. Each step is deliberate, echoing a deeper resolve to move forward rather than dwell on old hurts.

Beneath the tree’s boughs, the branches sing with a chorus of chiming bells, each note a gentle reminder that no single moment—or slight—should ever hold my spirit captive. I close my eyes, place my hand against the cool bark, and let the melody envelop me, a lullaby of forgiveness and acceptance. I breathe in and taste starlight on my lips.

For a tranquil moment, time stands still. My heartbeat slows, and all that remains is a sense of oneness with this strange, wonderful dream realm. I realize that I am not merely a captive to rumination. I am the dreamer, the weaver of illusions, and I can choose to transform what confines me into what frees me.

With that thought, the dream swells around me, vibrant colors surging as if the plateau itself were applauding my small epiphany. I gaze one last time at the shimmering sky, grateful for lessons only dreams can impart… and begin to wake, carrying the memory of that golden orb of compassion and the silent symphony of acceptance back to my waking life.
