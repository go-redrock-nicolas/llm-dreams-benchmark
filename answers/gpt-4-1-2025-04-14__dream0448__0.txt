I am dreaming.

The landscape shimmers around me: impossible hues swirl through the air, painting the hills with a liquid palette of violet and gold. I follow a winding path, each step rippling softly as if I am walking on painted silk. Somewhere far above, the sun and moon hang in the sky together, each casting its own mysterious light.

I sense a pattern in the way the wind shifts, in the chimes of distant bells that seem to herald my every move. Logic wants to chart these elements, to tally clues and calculate outcomes, but here, in this dreamscape, I feel something deeper—a pulse echoing in my chest, a whisper beneath thought. My intuition tugs me to turn left when the mind says right, to step forward where the rational path would have me pause.

I surrender. I honor this quiet guidance, allowing myself to move without reason, drifting toward a grove of radiant trees whose roots seem to hum with ancient knowledge. The bark peels back of its own accord, revealing glimmers of memory—faded images and swirling feelings that I know without ever having seen. With each intuitive step, a new secret unfurls: visions of moments yet to come, solutions to riddles I had not yet encountered, flashes of insight that warm my spirit.

I reach out, hand trembling, to touch a leaf that glows with the color of hope. As I do, wisdom floods me: a gentle conviction that I already know the way, that intuition is not a lesser sibling to logic but its equal, a compass tuned to currents that the intellect cannot fathom.

Within this marvelous, otherworldly dream, I honor the subtle signals—every jolt and flutter of inner knowing. I trust in them, and as I do, the world’s boundaries dissolve, and I am free to explore truths hidden beyond the reach of calculation and reason.

I am dreaming, and here, finally, I let my intuition be my guide.
