I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Crumbling Clock**  

I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of damp paper and rusted metal, the kind of smell that clings to forgotten places. I stand in a vast, dimly lit hall, its ceiling lost in shadows, its walls lined with towering stacks of unfinished books, yellowed scrolls, and dusty ledgers—all bearing my name. My stomach knots. I know what this is. Every undone task, every postponed deadline, towers around me like a collapsing empire.  

At the center of the room, an enormous clock groans, its brass gears strained, its pendulum swinging in slow, labored arcs. The face is cracked, and the hands—though they still move—are bent backward, as if resisting time itself. My breath catches. The final deadline. It looms like a storm on the horizon, inescapable. With every tick, the floor beneath me trembles, and flakes of plaster rain from above.  

I try to move, to reach the desk buried beneath piles of untouched work, but my feet are heavy, as though submerged in tar. Each step is a battle, every movement sluggish and futile. The clock ticks louder. Louder. A deep, resonant chime begins to sound, shaking the foundations of the room. The towers of neglected obligations sway, then crumble—sheets of paper cascade like autumn leaves, burying me beneath the weight of my own delay.  

The clock strikes midnight.  

The hands snap. The gears scream. And with a final, echoing crack, the face of the clock explodes outward, releasing a flood of thick, black sand—time itself, wasted, pouring over my hands, my shoulders, drowning me in the residue of my hesitation. I gasp—  

And wake.  

Heart pounding. Sheets damp with sweat.  

The real deadline still hangs before me.  

But now, the weight of the dream lingers… sharper than any alarm.
