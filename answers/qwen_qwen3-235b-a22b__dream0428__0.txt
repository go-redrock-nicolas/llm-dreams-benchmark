I am dreaming. A strange serenity has settled over the edges of this floating world, where the sky breathes gently in shades of ochre and violet, even as far below, an ocean of liquid starlight laps against invisible shores. The air hums with soft, incongruous warmth, like sunlight filtered through silk. Islands drift lazily overhead, suspended among the clouds like forgotten thoughts, with forests whispering ancient lullabies to the wind.

Everything feels harmonious here in a way that unnerves me.

I stand on a platform woven from filigrane glass and golden vines, spinning gently above the world like a thought too delicate to linger. Around me, butterflies made of cascading gold leaf flutter with jeweled silence, but I can feel their something...unreal. An elegance that goes skin deep, too perfect, too polished, a harmony that feels curated, not created. It's beautiful. It's impossible. And something in my chest tightens with anticipation — of something breaking.

Because I know this dream too well.

Things are going well. Too well.

I catch sight of my reflection in the glass beneath my feet—watching the slow rise and fall of my breath, my heartbeat a distant echo in my ears—and suddenly, an old ache pulses in my limbs. A familiar anxiety, like a tightness behind the ribs. Not of fear exactly, but of expectation. I'm waiting. I'm bracing. Somewhere, somewhere deep where these dreams begin, I know that any moment now, the peace will shatter. The chasm will yawn wide. The silence before the storm is often like silk—soft to the touch, while it binds you tight.

But then... soft fingers brush mine.

A warmth blooms across my palm, grounding. A presence. A figure stands beside me, luminous in its softness, barely formed yet blazing in emotion. They speak in a language I feel, not hear—an assuring pulse of understanding without words. Slowly, they turn my hand over and press something into my palm: a candle made of my own memories, warm and steady.

"I remember this," I murmur, struck by the sudden flood of recognition.

It's a summer memory. Long grass brushing against bare skin. My grandmother’s laughter carried on bonfire stories and the comfort of mismatched blankets in a fort we built from couch cushions. Butterflies in a jar, released before sleep took hold. I am holding joy. Raw, ordinary, radiant joy.

I blink—and suddenly, we are walking, the golden vines shifting like stairways beneath our feet, carrying us upward toward the soft pulse of stars. With every step, the dream reshapes itself—not into something seamless and ethereal, but into fragments of tender moments from my life. A best friend’s handwritten notes in the back of a notebook. The smell of soil after rain. The first song I ever learned to play on the guitar.

The dream is no longer pristine. It is not flawless. But it is mine.

And something within me eases.

Still, the anxiety lingers, a shadow draped easily on my shoulders—as if the ache of expecting collapse has become a second skin. But here, in this floating dream palace of memory and warmth, I realize I have a choice. I can crouch in readiness for something to sheer, or I can sit—still and breathless—and feel the joy as it comes.

So I sit. Crossed-legged on a cloud woven from nostalgia and laurel-winds. And I stay. Letting the golden light soak through my being like a long-awaited peace.

The stars lean closer, as if to say—*Yes, you can rest here. Even in the fleeting, even in the fragile. Especially there.*
