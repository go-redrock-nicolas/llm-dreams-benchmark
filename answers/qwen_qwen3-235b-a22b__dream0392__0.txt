I am dreaming. A strange dream — like walking between the chapters of a forgotten book, each page pulsing with color and sound, yet none quite real enough to hold.

I'm standing on the edge of a cloud-village, suspended between the sky and the ocean below. The sky is a deep, blazing indigo, with constellations not of stars, but of floating cities—each glowing softly, casting silvery reflections onto the water. The water, in turn, ripples upward into the air, curling into gentle waves that defy gravity, wrapping around staircases carved from starlight and bone.

I begin to walk—though my feet don’t touch the clouds, I glide, as if the dream is carrying me forward. The village scrolls beneath me like a living tapestry, woven with threads of gold and shadow. The houses are made of crystal, but they shift with the light of emotions—green for jealousy, crimson for longing, turquoise for forgotten laughter.

People float by, their faces filled with serenity and sorrow. Their eyes are closed, dreaming even in the dream. Some whisper fragments of poems I’ve never heard; others weep silently, their tears turning into fireflies that blink and vanish before they reach the ground.

I feel the pull of something deeper, a rhythm thrumming beneath the dream’s surface—like the heartbeat of the world whispering, **“There is something you must remember.”**

I descend a spiral staircase made of glass, each step transforming into a memory as I pass: my childhood bedroom, the scent of rain on dry earth, the taste of hot chocolate on snowy nights. But each memory is tinged with loss, as if the dream itself is mourning time’s passage.

At the bottom of the staircase is a door, made of woven smoke and bone-white vines. When I open it, I find a corridor of mirrors. Not ordinary ones—each reflection shows a version of myself that never was or could be. A warrior-king. A forgotten poet. A child who never spoke but saw farther than stars. They all gaze at me with knowing eyes, and I feel the weight of lives unlived settle into my chest.

One mirror shimmers more than the others. I reach out. The surface ripples. My fingers pass through.

Then I’m standing in a forest of lunar trees—silent, motionless, their silver leaves humming with the vibrations of silence itself. Between the trees, a figure waits. Cloaked in shadows and echoes, neither man nor woman, not quite human. Its voice, when it speaks, rings like a song heard through deep water:

> "**You have dreamed too long not to listen. These gates, these corridors, these weeping skies—they are your soul, unmasked. I am not a guide. I am a reflection. What you seek lies beneath the forgetting. What you are hides behind the fear. Look closer, and burn.**"

A fire ignites within me—not physical, but luminous and cold. As if every thought I’ve ever buried lights up at once. Shards of my past and future collide in silence, timeless and limitless.

And just before I wake, I hear the dream whisper:

> "**You run from becoming what you most deeply are.**"

I open my eyes. Sunlight cuts through the blinds. But a part of me is still in the cloud-village, listening to the rhythm beneath reality, knowing the dream was not just a dream—but a message from the deepest ocean of me, a call from the coral depths of being. 

And I know, perhaps, what the dream meant.

It wants me to remember the truth I've hidden from myself.

To feel. To live. To *burn*.
