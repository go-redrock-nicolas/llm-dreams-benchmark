I am dreaming.

In this luminous landscape where reality melts at the edges, I stand barefoot in a silver-blue forest. The trees are crystalline, shaped like giant pieces of spun glass shimmering with their own inner light. Moonlit mist weaves languidly around my ankles and the air is thick with the scent of starflowers, petals glimmering with unknown colors. An intuitive warmth tugs at my chest—a wordless summons, felt more than heard. It’s as if my ribcage is a compass, its needle spinning until it settles, pointing resolutely down a winding, luminescent path.

With every step, the moss beneath my feet pulses with phosphorescence, igniting like emerald embers. I travel deeper, following the strange gravity of this inner guidance. Shadows dance around me, never menacing but suggestive—each one flickers, briefly revealing fragments of memory and longing: a quiet laugh, the brush of wind on skin, the sense of a hand once held. They urge me onward.

At the heart of the forest, a clearing opens. In its center floats a pool, its surface still and dark, reflecting not the canopy above but a sky I’ve never known—one adorned with constellations shifting in unfamiliar rhythms. I move closer, kneeling, and see my own face ripple and transform, eyes swirling with galaxies. My heart pounds, recognizing the quiet certainty of purpose.

Suddenly, a voice not from without but within surges up, ringing as clear as a bell in the silent air: “Step forward. Create. Love. Heal.” All that I have been—hesitant, uncertain—falls away as I lean into the pool. Waves of color and sound envelope me, each one a possibility blossoming: a future crafted not from fear, but from the wild, relentless call of my truest self.

In this moment, I am infinite—intertwined with everything I know and everything I have yet to become. And from the deepest part of the dream, I awaken, suffused with the shimmering certainty that my true direction has been revealed.
