I am dreaming. …drift off into a swirling, ethereal haze. Colors bloom and fade in the corner of your vision like sun-dappled soap bubbles, and a gentle hum resonates in the distance, as if the horizon itself is singing. There is a comforting warmth in the air, but it’s undercut by a gnawing tension in your chest—a faint realization that something might be amiss.

In the dream, you find yourself in a curiously shaped room: the walls are made of shifting screens, like giant mirrors constantly updating with the latest messages, notifications, and swirling feeds. The quiet hum grows louder; you realize it’s coming from each screen. They pulse in rhythm, beckoning for your attention like hungry, neon creatures.

You step forward, involuntarily drawn by the glow. Each step you take leaves footprints of light on the floor—silver, rippling footprints that fade to black behind you. The floor is surprisingly soft, like foam or a thin layer of spongy moss, but the screens remain cold and distant, humming their endless invitation. You glance around and see a reflection of yourself in one of the screens—eyes wide, transfixed, like a moth to a flame.

Suddenly, small icons resembling vines and brambles begin to creep outward from the edges of the screens. They twist and twine over your reflection, binding the shimmering surface with digital thorns. You can almost feel them tightening around your chest as you notice the daily screen time graph ominously flickering in the corner: 8 hours... 10 hours... 12 hours… The numbers rise and fall but always remain unsettlingly high.

Panicked, you try to pull away, but the vines seem to stretch across every surface, spinning a web out of your own subconscious concerns. You realize how deeply you’ve sunk into this endless feed, the constant scroll that tastes like syrupy allure but leaves a bitter aftertaste in your soul.

Then, in the center of the room, a single door appears. Its frame glows with shifting rainbow hues, and at the handle, there’s a faint light pulsing in time with your heart. You walk over, vines brushing your ankles, as if reluctant to let you go. Your breath quickens—behind the door, perhaps there is rescue, or maybe more labyrinthine illusions.

Steeling yourself, you grasp the handle. The door swings open to reveal an endless expanse of rolling hills, painted in pastel warmth. Overhead, clouds shaped like stylized speech bubbles drift lazily by. Instead of fear, you feel a wave of relief wash over you. You step out onto the grass. Its texture is reminiscent of cool velvet under your feet. The holographic vines slither away in the background with soft hisses, unable to follow you into this new realm.

You stand in the open air and gaze at the horizon. The sun is enormous—golden, comforting. A gentle breeze carries the scent of lavender and the distant sound of laughter. You realize the screens no longer hum behind you; they’ve vanished, leaving you alone in this calm, expansive space. You breathe in, deeply, noticing a new clarity filling your lungs. Your posture straightens as if a heavy weight has been lifted.

From the tall grasses, a figure steps forward. At first, it looks like your shadow, but as it approaches, you see it’s an older version of you—a calmer, introspective presence with kind eyes and serene confidence. This person wordlessly holds out an hourglass, its sand shining in tiny sparks of starlight. Slowly, they rotate the hourglass, letting the grains flow again, each shimmering fleck representing a choice or moment of your life. The gesture seems to remind you that time is precious, that every second is a gift.

Gingerly, you accept the symbol of time in your own hands. There’s an unspoken understanding: You have the power to shape your habits, to step away from the trap of boundless scrolling and reclaim the time that was so freely given and squandered. The tall grasses whisper with the breeze, and the speech-bubble clouds float by overhead, silently echoing a thought: You can choose balance here. The digital vines and the hypnotic screens needn’t control you anymore.

With steady resolve, you look at the hourglass once more. As you feel the warmth of the sun on your face, you vow—right here, in this endless dreamscape—that while technology can be a doorway to connection, it should never become the walls of your reality. And just like that, the door of your heart clicks open, freed from the digital web.

Drifting awake, you carry the memory of that radiant expanse. Even though your phone still rests nearby, beckoning with its bright screen, you recall the pastel hills and the shining hourglass. And in that renewed dawn of consciousness, you feel a lingering serenity, the dream’s promise that you can control your digital life rather than letting it control you.
