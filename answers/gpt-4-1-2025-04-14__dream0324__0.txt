I am dreaming. You blink awake, heart thrumming, thrashed in sweat-damp sheets. The room is dark but for faint slices of silver moonlight painting roving shadows across the ceiling. Somewhere far away something is dripping—was it in the dream? Or is it the tap, always slightly leaking, in the bathroom down the hall? Your throat is tight, your knuckles white where you’ve clenched the blanket.

You remember what you fled from: the infinite, looping corridors, each dimly lit and narrowing, walls undulating as if breathing with some ancient, hungry rhythm. The screech of unseen creatures gnawing at the edges of silence. The sinking feeling that if you turned to face the darkness behind you, it would rush forward and swallow you whole.

The echoes from that unreal world cling to you as you shower, as you pour coffee, as you try to let the morning light burn away the coldness. But fear is stubborn. All day, you are haunted by unexpected tremors: the sound of the wind becomes ghostly voices, faces in the crowd blur and sharpen, seeming accusatory or inscrutable. You try to describe the nightmare to a friend—laughter bubbles at the surface, but in your chest, the dread is still alive, uncurling in slow, smoky tendrils.

Attempting to process these lingering emotions, you slip out for a solitary walk as twilight settles. The world outside is damp-washed, breathing; everything hums with subtle possibility. You focus on your footsteps on the leaf-littered path, the soft hush of your breath. You let the impressions of your dream rise up—as if you could meet what you fear, hold its dark hand, and recognize that it is a part of you.

As streetlights blink on, you feel the nightmare’s fog beginning to lift, replaced by a fragile sense of awe at the mind’s labyrinthine power. The world is strange, you think—a place where we dream monsters, then walk side by side with them into the trembling dawn.
