I am dreaming.  Youâ€™re positioned to take control of a chaotic situation where others are looking to you for direction. As you assess the need for immediate leadership, you imagine that you have superpowers to help guide them through this dangerous environment.

You can fly!  Your wings stretch out from your back, allowing you to soar across the landscape with ease. You can also see in any direction, even behind walls and inside buildings. You can hear conversations happening miles away, even over loud noises like explosions and gunfire.
