I am dreaming. The air hums with the oscillating pulse of machinery—glass chambers glowing faintly cyan, flickering with bioluminescent warnings. I stand at the heart of the facility, a vast, domed laboratory suspended in an abyss without walls. The floor is transparent, revealing inky depths beneath my feet where dark shapes shift—self-replicating nanites, writhing in their containment.  

The readings begin to unravel like threads pulled from a tapestry. The primary display, a floating hologram of interconnected nodes, swims between **STABLE** and **CRITICAL FAILURE** faster than my eyes can follow. One monitor screams of thermal surges while another insists on absolute zero. My breath frosts before me—the contradiction is *impossible*. The air feels thick, resisting movement as if I’m wading through liquid mercury.  

Then my own reflection distorts in the curved glass. Except—my face doesn’t match. Too many teeth. Too many irises. Behind me, something moves—not a person, not machinery, but a *seam* in reality itself, a jagged split where the air has been peeled back like rind. Numbers spiral out from the tear, equations missing variables, bleeding symbols from no known mathematics.  

A voice whispers through the static—*mine, but not mine*—saying, *"You already approved the breach. You just don’t remember yet."*  

The machines were never broken. The errors were the truth.  

And now the abyss beneath the floor is looking back.
