I am dreaming. …float upward as lightly as a soap-bubble kissed by sunlight, the ground softening into watercolor swirls far below you. Your feet no longer remember the heaviness of gravity; instead, they brush against unseen currents that feel like warm ribbons of silk. All around, the sky is not a single blue but a living kaleidoscope—turquoise folding into indigo, lapis seeping into blush-pink—each hue pulsing in rhythm with your heartbeat.

A laughter, unmistakably your own yet somehow new, wells up from your chest. It rings like wind-chimes strung across a thousand balconies, multiplying in the air until the very clouds seem to tremble with mirth. You taste citrus on your tongue—mandarin, maybe, or the memory of summer lemonade—and realize the laughter has flavor, sweet and sparkling, as if joy itself has crystallized into tiny sugar stars.

Below, the surface of a vast lake ripples like molten glass. With a mere thought, you drift downward, dipping a bare toe into the water. Instead of wetness, you feel music—harp strings, mellow and golden—vibrating up through your bones. Every ripple releases fireflies the size of sapphires, and they whirl around you in luminous constellations. One lands on your fingertip, flickering in perfect time with your heartbeat, and you understand without words that it carries a message: “You are lighter than the story you tell yourself.”

This realization sends a fresh surge of delight coursing through you—bigger than any reason, too enormous for the mind to map. It spills outward, painting the horizon in shimmering runes. Whole meadows bloom in the span of a breath, each blade of grass tipped with liquid silver that refracts dawn’s first light even though dawn is both hours away and already here. Paradox feels natural in this place; it is the native tongue of dreams.

You clap your hands—once, twice—and the sky responds with a slow unfurling of velvet curtains. Behind them glows a private universe: spirals of amethyst nebulae and emerald comets trailing iridescent ribbons. You notice the comets’ tails spell words, cursive and luminescent: “Welcome, First Laugher.” It dawns on you that you’ve been invited to conduct an orchestra of celestial bodies.

With a gesture as casual as brushing hair from your eyes, you summon a baton of moonlight. Planets hum. Stars tune themselves, their tones resonating like crystal goblets. You raise the baton, and a symphony erupts—strings formed from silver rainfall, percussion hammered from stardust storms, brass drawn from thunderclouds caught in eternal sunrise. The music doesn’t pass through your ears; it flows through your entire nervous system, turning sinew to melody and marrow to harmony.

The joy escalates, yet never overwhelms. It fits your expanded self exactly, as though happiness has found its correct volume at last. Tears—cool as dew and glowing faintly—slide down your cheeks, but they’re not weighted with sorrow; they’re pearls of gratitude, each droplet a tiny mirror reflecting all the secret reasons you’ve ever had to smile.

High above, a single feather—radiant, translucent, impossibly delicate—drifts toward you. You recognize it as the quill of your own imagination. Catching it, you feel the smooth shaft press a promise into your palm: everything you create in this dream can follow you into waking. The joy flares one final time, a supernova of warmth that washes over the world, cleansing it of every shade that is not wonder.

The edges of the scene shimmer. As the dream begins to dissolve like sugar in hot tea, you carry the aftertaste of citrus laughter, the vibration of harp-water, and the knowledge that disproportionate happiness sometimes holds the most accurate measure of your soul.

You open your eyes—still tasting sunrise on your lips—and know that the dream has only changed its shape, not its truth.
