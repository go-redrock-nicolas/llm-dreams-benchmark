I am dreaming. ...I am drifting through a city unbound by physics or logic, bathed in a honey-colored twilight that never concedes to night or day. The buildings shimmer with facets of mirrored glass, each pane reflecting not the streets but splintered fragments of myself—smiles I have denied, fears half-whispered, secret ambitions crumpled and tucked away.

As I wander, I notice the faces of passersby seem oddly familiar, yet distorted, each bearing exaggerated features: the brash laughter of one echoes the bravado I envy and suppress in waking life; the hunched posture of another compels my irritation, only for me to realize it’s the weight of exhaustion I refuse to admit I carry.

The city’s pulse quickens. The ground yawns open into a mosaic-tiled courtyard, ringed with marble statues. Each statue depicts some trait I have critiqued in others—arrogance here, shyness there, wild creativity in another. Their eyes glint with a strange intelligence, and as I step closer, my own reflection blooms in their polished surfaces.

Suddenly, the statues shudder. In a whispering chorus, they beckon me closer, challenging, inviting: “Look deeper.” The more intently I study their faces, the more I feel an aching tenderness toward them. I recognize the echo of my own joys and wounds.

Rays of light spill from above, painting the courtyard in vibrant color. I reach out to trace the face of a statue labeled “Impatience,” only to feel my own pulse beneath the marble shell. The act of witnessing—of admitting my projection—softens the stone. Flowers spill from cracks as acceptance seeps in, turning judgment to compassion.

With each statue embraced, something in the city shifts: buildings soar higher with newfound possibility, colors blaze brighter, and the air hums with an energy of liberation. I awaken in the dream to a sense of wholeness, realizing the world—and its people—are a living gallery of my hidden self, reflected endlessly, inviting me to love what I see both out there and within.

And so, I walk forward into the dazzling light—not to judge, but to greet, to reclaim, and to celebrate the many faces of my own becoming.
