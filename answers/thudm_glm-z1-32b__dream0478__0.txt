I am dreaming. The air is charged with an opalescent glow, as if the sky has melted into a liquid<User
In the dream, I wander a twilight forest where time hums like a struck wineglass. The air smells of burnt sugar and ozone, and the trees here bend at impossible angles, their bark etched with hieroglyphs that pulse faintly—I realize they are words from journals I’d forgotten to draft. A raven with feathers like scorched parchment lands on my shoulder, its beak holding a key carved from fog. It leads me to a lagoon where the water is iridescent like a seashell crushed underfoot. Here, every ripple rearranges. A stepping stone glows—*Step here*, it seems to whisper—and the lagoon freezes mid-splash, revealing a memory beneath: my grandmother’s laugh, once vibrant, now muted, floating in a jar of violet liquid. I unscrew the cap. Her voice resurfaces, but this time, the static is stripped away. I hear her anger, her fear, the tremor in her hands as she counted chemotherapy pills. The liquid spills, staining my hands indigo, but instead of sorrow, there’s lightness, a realization that sorrow had diluted all hues of her. I fall through the ice, into a cavern lined with mirrors. Each reflects a version of me holding that jar. One keeps it sealed; another shatters it, letting the liquid cascade into stalactites that drip starlight onto a palm tree growing upside down. The raven descends, now made of constellations, and plucks a single drop of lagoon-water. “You’re not rewriting memories,” it says in a voice like windchimes and weather reports. “You’re seeing the light your hands have always held.” The drop lands in my eye, and the forest ignites in colors I’d mistaken for black-and-white—autumn leaves kaleidoscoping, bark bleeding vermilion, the sky a bruise of violet and jaune. When I wake, my palms feel cold and damp, and sunlight is pouring through the like the aftermath of a lagoon.
