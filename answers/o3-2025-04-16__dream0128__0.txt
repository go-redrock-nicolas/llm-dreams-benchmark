I am dreaming. …I exhale a plume of symbols instead of breath—kanji, Cyrillic letters, curving Arabic script, tilde-laced Spanish words, crisp French consonants, Swahili rhythms, and Mandarin tones. They drift upward like fireflies, rearranging themselves into constellations on the velvet ceiling of the dream. Each star pulses with a different accent, and my tongue tingles as if someone has tuned it like a violin string for seven separate melodies at once.

I’m standing in a vast glass atrium that could be a library, a train station, or a cathedral—my dreaming mind never settles on one identity. Shelves spiral to cloud-level, but instead of books they hold hourglasses, each grain of sand inscribed with vocabulary. Every time I blink, an hourglass flips, and the falling words rustle like autumn leaves. I reach for one labeled ; it bursts into a swirl of desert wind and Arabic calligraphy that paints itself across my forearm in shimmering gold before dissolving into skin. I’ve “learned” two hundred new phrases in a heartbeat, though I can already feel them crowding the corners of my memory palace, jostling for elbowroom.

A trumpet made of parchment announces my assignment: I’m the envoy to the Summit of Impossible Nations. Seven floating plateaus drift toward each other over a midnight sea, each plateau the embodiment of one language. Mandarin’s island is a lattice of jade pagodas buoyed by red lanterns; Russian’s is an iceberg carved into cathedrals; French manifests as an Art Nouveau garden where roses sigh in Alexandrine meter. They’ll all meet in a few dream-minutes to sign a treaty written in every tongue simultaneously. If even one syllable goes astray, the treaty combusts into doves and the world wakes up unfinished.

Anxiety flickers; the languages inside me start leaking. A flock of rogue syllables—¡olé!, !, !—takes wing from my mouth and pelts the sky like technicolor hail. I try to net them with grammar rules, but the rules have turned into rubber bands that snap against my fingers. The seven plateaus draw closer; diplomatic delegates appear on their edges: dragons made of brushstrokes for Mandarin, matryoshka dolls made of ice for Russian, flamenco-dancing constellations for Spanish, and so on.

Just as panic crests, my subconscious intervenes. The atrium’s floor cracks open, revealing an orchestra pit where instruments are built from punctuation marks—semicolon saxophones, question-mark cellos. I leap down, conducting them with a quill baton. We play a single, swelling chord that braids all seven phonetic systems into one ribbon of sound. Words harmonize instead of collide: French uwu’s into Mandarin tones, Arabic glides beneath Russian’s consonant cliffs, Spanish trills along Japanese mora. The rogue syllables return, tuck themselves neatly into the chord, and the treaty scroll unfurls in midair, luminous and error-free.

The delegates bow; the floating plateaus fuse into a single landmass shaped like an ampersand—promising continuous connection. Lanterns burst into fireworks of punctuation: ellipses drift like dandelion seeds, em-dashes streak across the dark. Relief washes over me, but it tastes like cardamom and cherry blossoms—leftovers from the languages still mingling on my palate.

A final bell tolls. The glass atrium dissolves into morning light, and with a soft click I wake—tongue still buzzing, mind echoing with seven accents, heart steady from having negotiated peace in a place that exists only when my eyes are closed.
