I am dreaming.

I stand in a city built of glass towers and silver bridges that bend and glimmer beneath a sky swirling with lavender and gold. The air tastes faintly of vanilla and ozone, electric but somehow soothing. I wander these shining streets barefoot, feeling the gentle hum of life pulsing through the luminous ground.

As I turn a crystal corner, I see someone—a radiant figure, aglow with easy confidence—standing atop a spiral staircase of emerald and pearl. A crowd gathers below, their faces upturned, eyes shining with adoration and awe. I know immediately what this place is: This is the realm of achievement, of dreams made manifest. The figure on the stairs has done what I’ve longed for, their every word igniting the crowd, each gesture painting streaks of color in the air.

A sudden pang twists through my heart. Jealousy: sharp, unmistakable, and as clear as any pain. I feel transparent, as though everyone sees through me to this raw nerve inside. The emotion is heavy, electric, and it threatens to sweep me away.

But I am lucid and curious. I lean gently into the feeling rather than recoiling from it. What does this jealousy mean? I close my eyes. The city’s light flows through me like a current, and I listen to the thrum of my heart.

Images spill through my mind like watercolor: every late night, every hope, every seed of effort planted and tended. I realize my jealousy is not about them, but about the version of myself that I fear is out of reach. The figure at the top of the stairs isn’t so different from who I imagine I could be—if only.

I breathe in the shimmering air, letting my breath gather the envy like beads on a string. I exhale, and it transforms: not into bitterness, but into bittersweet aspiration—a desire to try, to create, to shine my own light.

I step toward the spiral staircase, the crowd parting gently for me, every face warm and familiar now. With each step, my jealousy becomes a kind of fuel, igniting a wild and hopeful determination. The radiant figure notices me and smiles—a secret, knowing smile. I realize, with a soft jolt, that it is me at the top as well; a version of me I’m growing toward. The edges between us blur, and the city swells with possibility.

I am dreaming, and in this dream, even my most uncomfortable emotions have dazzling, transformative power.
