I am dreaming. I'm in a place where my imagination can run wild and create anything I want.  But today, I'm going to use it to make you feel something different than normal.  

You're walking through a forest at night.  The trees are tall and old, with branches that reach out toward the moon.  You hear noises coming from all directions: animals howling, insects chirping, water flowing.  It's eerie and beautiful at the same time.  

You come upon a pond where the water reflects the sky like a mirror.  In it, you see your own face looking back at you â€” but it's not your real face.   It's a mask made of wood and leaves that covers your entire head except for two eyes carved out of stone.    You don't know who put it on you or why they did so.    

You crouch down next to the pond and dip your hand into the water.  It feels cool and refreshing against your skin.  

Suddenly, you hear a sound behind you.   A voice calling your name in a language you've never heard before.    You turn around quickly but see nothing there except shadows dancing on the tree trunks.   

You wonder if this is just another one of your dreams where nothing means anything and everything changes constantly. 

But then again, maybe it's more than that...
