I am dreaming. I'm standing at the threshold of two doorways that have manifested in the middle of a vast, undulating meadow. The grass beneath my feet shifts between emerald and sapphire with each breath of wind, creating waves like an earthbound ocean. The sky above is not one color but many—streaks of violet and amber bleeding into each other as if painted by some cosmic hand.

Before me stands an elderly woman with eyes that reflect galaxies, her silver hair floating around her head as if she's underwater. "The path you seek lies through the door of thorns," she says, gesturing to the left doorway—a twisted arch of brambles that prick and bleed with rubies instead of blood.

My heart tightens. Everything within me pulls toward the right door—a simple wooden frame with warm light spilling through, carrying the scent of cinnamon and safety.

"But I feel drawn to this one," I say, pointing to the wooden door, my intuition humming like a tuning fork struck against my bones.

"Feelings deceive," the woman replies, her voice like distant chimes. "What you want and what you need rarely share the same face."

As I hesitate, the meadow around us begins to fold inward, the horizon creasing like paper. The sun splits into twin orbs, casting double shadows at my feet—one pointing left, one pointing right.

I place my hand on my chest and feel my heartbeat spelling out a message in morse code only I can decipher. The woman's advice carries wisdom, perhaps centuries of it, yet my intuition has carried me through storms before.

Time slows as I step toward my choice, watching as reality bends around my decision, worlds branching from this pivotal moment. In the distance, a clock with backwards numbers begins to chime, and I realize that whatever door I choose will forever close the other path...

The ground shifts beneath me as I make my choice, and I'm falling through layers of consciousness, the dream fragmenting around me like shattered glass, each piece reflecting a different outcome of the path I've chosen...
