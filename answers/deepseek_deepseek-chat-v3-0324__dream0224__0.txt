I am dreaming. The air shimmers like liquid glass around me, pulsing with an iridescent glow as if the very fabric of existence is breathing. Beneath my feet, the ground isn’t solid—it’s a rippling mosaic of possibilities, shifting like sand dunes under an unseen wind. Every step I take sends fractal echoes spiraling outward, splitting the world around me into infinite reflections, each one a different choice, a different fate.  

I lift my hand, and in one reality, I turn left—where a city of floating obsidian spires hums with neon energy, alive with whispering machines that translate thoughts into light. In another, I turn right, and the world melts into an endless sea of golden wheat, where colossal clockwork birds glide silently overhead, their brass feathers ticking like metronomes.  

The paradox doesn’t fracture me—it expands me. My consciousness stretches across dimensions, feeling the weight of each decision pressing against eternity. A version of me embraces a lover beneath a dying star; another version kneels alone in ruins, whispering to ghosts. Somewhere else, I never existed at all, and the world bends into stranger shapes without me.  

Then—a sound. A low, resonant tone, vibrating through the seams of reality. It pulls at me, weaving my scattered selves into momentary harmony. The timelines flicker like candle flames in a draft, and for a heartbeat, I see them all at once—the triumphs, the regrets, the lives I’ll never live.  

But before the dream can collapse under the weight of its own depth, I wake—only to wonder if waking was just another branch, another choice, another world unfolding.   

And the shimmering air follows me into the light.
