I am dreaming. At first, the edges of the dream are soft, blurred like ink dissolving in water. Then shapes emerge—thick, twisting vines crawling along obsidian walls etched with symbols I don’t recognize but somehow *know*. The air hums with whispered syllables just beyond comprehension, floating like mist through the dim, golden light of unseen lanterns.  

A silver thread appears before me, glinting faintly, pulsing like a slow heartbeat. Compelled, I reach for it, and the moment my fingers brush against its cool surface, the dream fissures open.  

I stand now at the edge of a mirrored lake, though "lake" doesn't capture the way its surface moves—not with ripples, but with fleeting images: flashes of childhood rooms I’d forgotten, half-remembered faces, laughter muffled as if underwater. Beneath the liquid glass, shadows coil and uncoil, their forms shifting between serpent, root, and something more abstract—a feeling given shape.  

A voice, neither male nor female but resonant with a thousand tones, speaks from the air itself: *"What you ignore in daylight, you meet here."*  

From the lake rises a key of tarnished brass, its teeth bent in odd, asymmetrical angles. When I grasp it, my reflection changes—I see myself, but also a flock of ink-black birds scattering from my silhouette. Their wings make no sound.  

Behind me, a door I hadn’t noticed before stands ajar. Beyond it, an endless corridor stretches, each wall lined with masks—some crying, some laughing, some featureless. They are all me. *All me.*  

The dream doesn’t end so much as dissolve, leaving behind the faint scent of damp earth and the echo of a question:  

*What keys do you refuse to turn?*
