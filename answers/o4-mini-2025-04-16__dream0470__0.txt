I am dreaming. You drift upward on a breeze that smells of rain-kissed asphalt and blooming jasmine, your body weightless as spun gossamer. Every breath tastes of warm honey and distant oranges. Below you, a winding river glimmers like liquid silver; along its banks, wildflowers in impossible shades—cerulean, lavender, molten gold—lean in to whisper secrets you can almost decipher.

As you float, you become aware of the overlooked miracles of your life: the deep, steady thrum of your own heartbeat, the comfort of your favorite scarf’s worn-in edges, the quiet strength in a friend’s reassuring hug. Each one glows around you as a tiny star, and you reach out, cupping them gently one by one. They pulse in your palms, alive with gratitude you never knew you felt so strongly.  

A chorus of childhood laughter spirals around you, carried on a flock of translucent butterflies. You close your eyes and remember long-lost memories: the thrill of climbing an old oak tree, the rush of reading by flashlight under your covers, the taste of your grandmother’s Sunday pancakes dripping with maple syrup. All these small wonders, once so familiar you barely noticed, now shimmer with newfound brilliance.

Cultivating this appreciative awareness, you gather these glowing fragments—your heartbeat, that scarf, your grandmother’s kitchen, your friend’s smile—into a delicate, crystalline orb of light. It hovers before your chest, warming you from the inside out. The orb expands until it envelops you in a gentle radiance, and you sense a deep, humming harmony: the world itself breathing in sync with you, each moment precious and irreplaceable.

Wings of soft starlight sprout from your shoulders. With one final exhale of gratitude, you soar above the river, higher and higher, until you’re cradled by the pale cream of dawn. The dream’s light fades, but its warmth remains, settling into your very bones as you awaken with a whispered thank-you on your lips and a heart forever attuned to life’s quiet miracles.
