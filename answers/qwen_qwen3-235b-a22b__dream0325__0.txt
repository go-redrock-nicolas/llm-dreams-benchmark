I am dreaming. 13

Night pulsed around me like the inside of a beating heart—velvet and alive. A moon, cracked and luminous, hung low over a city that was not a city, but something dreams borrow from cities. Towers jutted at impossible angles like the bones of ancient titans, and glassy bridges arched silently through the sky. The cobblestones beneath my feet were smooth and whispering, echoing memories I didn't remember making.

I was late for something—something important. 

The sky pulsed with colors that didn’t have names, shimmering like the inner curve of a soap bubble about to burst. My coat snapped in wind that came from nowhere, stitched thread to thread, fluttering like a flag fraying at the edges of time.

Then I saw them.

Sitting at a roundtable made of polished obsidian, floating on a lake that wasn't water but something thicker—ink, perhaps, or silence. Figures in shadow and gold light. They were speaking, murmuring words layered like sand on a forgotten shore. But one voice cut through—sharp, familiar, dripping with the weight of regard.

"You were not enough."

The speaker stepped forward, and though their face ebbed like flame in wind, I knew them. Their opinion had always mattered deeply. Their opinion had built scaffolds around my soul, and dismantled bridges when they chose to look away.

They held a scroll woven from smoke and lit with embers. My heart twisted inside me, clenching like a fist stuffed with crushed petals. 

"You thought this was good. You thought this would last. You thought your fearlessness was strength. But it was only noise."

Each word fell into me like a stone into a well. I could hear them ricocheting down, echoing until they could no longer be found.

"You see only what you imagine. You write only what you ache to believe. But stories—true stories—are harder than honesty. You didn’t build, beloved dreamer—you only tried to be seen."

There was no scream in me. Only silence, the kind that hollows mountains.

I stepped back. The sky cracked apart like an old painting. The city shuddered and began to dissolve into fog and distant chimes, as if forgotten places were trying to reclaim themselves.

A choir swelled, but without voices.

But in the maelstrom of that terrible vulnerability, I saw: small hands. My younger self, cloaked in starlight, writing in a hidden nook of the dreamscape with nothing but a shard of mirror and a pen made of ash. They didn’t write for praise. They wrote because the alternative was to vanish.

And suddenly—so beautifully—I remembered.

“You gave me the language of longing,” I whispered to the one whose gaze had cracked me. “You taught me how to listen. But you do not own the story. My dreams are not yours to define.”

They paused. A flicker passed through their form, like a curtain startled by wind.

In that moment, the obsidian table behind them melted into a thousand paper birds. Butterflies unfurled from the ink of their words, and the lake boiled up into mist. I reached out—not to grasp, but to release.

I woke from the dream wounded, but whole.

And writing into the light.
