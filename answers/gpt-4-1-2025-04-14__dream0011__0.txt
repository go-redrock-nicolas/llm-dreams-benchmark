I am dreaming. …drifting and swirling on the page, ink dissolving into dancing patterns that carry me away. The exam paper feels neither paper nor real—more like a thin mist, shifting with every blink of my eyes. The first question is written in shimmering golden script, but as I look closer, words tumble from their neat lines, becoming tiny origami birds that flutter up and around my head, their wings whispering secrets I can almost—but not quite—understand.

Anxious, I try to focus. The next question glows tomato red, asking: “Describe the weight of a memory, using only the language of wind.” I search my mind for an answer, but my thoughts are heavy, caught in the sticky syrup of confusion. My pen melts into a silver fish, slips from my hand, and dives into the grain of the wooden desk, leaving behind ripples that expand outward, distorting everything.

Suddenly, desk legs stretch tall as trees and sprout leaves—my seat floats high, sprawling branches supporting me gently. The classroom windows open to a sky painted in rolling colors: chartreuse, raspberry, indigo. Other students have become part of the scenery—one is leafing through a book whose pages are mirrors, another is typing on a typewriter that spits out flower petals instead of letters.

The instructor, now an owl in a robe embroidered with constellations, glides to me noiselessly and drops a feather onto my exam. Where the feather touches, the final question appears: “Draw the path your spirit wishes to walk.” I close my eyes, letting intuition guide my hand. I draw not lines, but rivers of light and shadow, looping and converging in impossible shapes. The paper drinks in my dreams, pulsing softly with color, until my entire world feels as if it’s breathing in time with my heartbeat.

Somewhere far off, I hear the chime of a bell. I open my eyes, and everything dissolves into a shimmering haze, the impossible questions lingering as soft echoes, urging me to remember—to seek out wonders even when I am awake.
