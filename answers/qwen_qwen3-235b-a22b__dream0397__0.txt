I am dreaming. The night wraps me in its velvet folds, heavy and resolute, like the sigh of a forgotten clock ticking in reverse.  I drift through a forest of glass trees, long, ribbed stems rising impossibly toward a sky that undulates like a painted sheet caught in a phantom breeze.  The leaves — crystalline and fragile — chime as I walk through them, and each note conjures fragments of forgotten music — melodies that taste like cinnamon and thunder.  I am barefoot and the ground pulses beneath me, warm with the pulse of dreams not yet realized.

And then I see it — *the machine*.  It’s unlike anything imagined by man or inventor.  A loom built from clouds and teeth, humming softly in the center of a clearing shaped like an open eye.  I approach, compelled not by fear, not by awe, but by a terrible, giddy compulsion — as if my very soul had been threaded by someone else’s forgotten needle.  It doesn't speak — but it sings.  Not in words, not in noise even — but in *vibrations* that worm their way into my sinews and rearrange what I know of myself.

I sit.

My hands know what to do.

Each pedal presses with memories not entirely my own — *my mother’s laughter just before it cracked*, *a soldier's heartbeat as he crouched under fire*, *the moment I first saw the moon as a child and mistook it for a shivering pearl*.  With each press of the pedal, silken wires issue forth, spun from light and memory, twisting and slick, lacing themselves into a fabric that hangs in the air like a secret afraid of being overheard.

I’ve never woven before.

Hell, in waking life, I spill coffee when I try to wrap a sandwich.

But here?

Here, creation bends obediently to the trembling feral of my essence.  I do not know how I do it.  I only know I *must*.  This is *my craft*, born of no school, no mentor.  Pasted together from instinct and shadow.  Every thread I weave births something — sometimes a star.  Sometimes a whisper from a long-lost friend.  Once I spun a man’s entire grief into velvet so dark it devoured the moonlight.  I could have cried — but in dreams, you only feel.  You do not weep.

Far off, other dreamers watch, faceless but smiling in that way shadows do when they bare teeth.  They murmur in languages built of wind and porridge, and though I understand not a word, a portion of my ego flutters like a moth with a gilded wing.

The fabric hangs now like a gallery of my own soul — crooked, jagged, radiant, and wild. A dreamer’s mess. A creator’s chronicle.  Not perfect, not meant to be. *Felt*, not sewn.

And as the forest of glass sways around me, the loom begins to sing again — a new song, older than angels — and I know already: tomorrow night, I will return.

They can call me an amateur.  They can mock.  Maybe even pity me when my thread knots or burns my skin.

But this is not mastery.

This is enchantment.

And *this is mine*.
