I am dreaming. The dream begins in a misty forest where every tree is an ancient giant, their thick roots twisting into the earth, and moss hanging like a curtain from gnarled branches. Rays of golden sunlight pierce the canopy above, casting shifting beams that dance on the forest floor. I move through the trees, the air thick and humid, carrying the earthy scent of damp soil and decaying leaves. Yet something else lingers in the air—a heaviness, not just in the forest but in my chest. It's familiar but avoided. 

As I walk deeper, the mist thickens, and the trees seem to lean in closer, whispering in a secret tongue that vibrates through me. Birds call softly, their songs interrupting each other like unfinished thoughts in my mind. My steps slow, the avoidance I feel growing heavier with each moment. I know something awaits me at the forest's heart, something I've kept at bay. I sense danger—not from any creature, but from within myself. An emotion, unbidden and unacknowledged, stirs in my chest, tugging at my center, a reminder that somewhere in this dream is an inevitable confrontation with the shadows I have turned from. 

And then, a clearing opens before me. In the center, a giant stone altar rises, cloaked in mist and adorned with glowing flowers of every color. The flowers seem alive, their petals opening and closing in a slow pulse, as if breathing. My heartbeat quickens, matching their rhythm, and I step toward it. But just as I near the altar, a soft voice calls out—a voice that isn’t a voice at all, but a vibration that plays in my chest and mind. “Welcome,” it says, though I see no one. “It is time.” 

Behind the altar, figures emerge from the mist, vague and shifting at first. They're humanoid but made of light, water, and shadow all at once. As they draw closer, I realize these are faces I've known before, yet never truly seen. Each is a mirror, reflecting versions of myself I've ignored: the grief I buried with my grandfather's passing, the guilt I carry for a forgotten slight, the resentment I feel at a choice someone made that unsettles me, and the shame I keep hidden from my mistakes. There is no hostility from them, though; their eyes hold understanding, a beckoning light that seems to say, “It’s safe here.” 

The forest grows silent as they surround me, abandoning their misty forms to converge into one, a swirling pool of light that spreads before me. Suddenly, I am falling, and the forest vanishes. I’m no longer standing; I’m sitting at a table with two chairs. Across from me, someone I can’t quite make out begins to speak. When they do, though, I hear it in another language—not English, but something more raw, more essential, and yet, so familiar I feel it in my bones. I understand every word. “It’s okay to feel what’s here. This is part of you.” 

The chairs shift, and I’m holding on to someone’s hand. They sit beside me, my grandpa as I’d known him when he was here, his laugh so clear it makes me ache. He speaks, not with his mouth but with a gentle light from his eyes, saying, “It’s been too long. It’s time to stop running.” His voice echoes, and I realize it’s the language of my forgotten emotions. The ones I’ve stored away, believing them dangerous to my self-image. In that moment, I begin to speak, only to find it isn't my voice either—it’s light, it’s air, it’s a release of all that’s been sitting heavy on my chest for years. 

The dream shifts again, and I’m floating high above the trees. Below, the altar glows brighter, and the mist swirls faster, as if the forest is breathing, letting in and letting go with every pulse of the flowers. As I descend, I feel lighter. I know that while there will be much to feel and move through, I am ready now. The heaviness is no longer a burden; it’s a part of me that’s simply been longing for its moment to be heard, to be seen. The mist clears, the sun grows brighter, and the dream shifts once more—I am myself, standing at the altar. With each breath, I feel the earth, the forest, the air, and an openness that embraces, rather than fears, all that has been buried.

I wake with a sense of calm, of balance, and of acceptance. The colors of the dream still vivid behind my eyes, the voice of my grandpa clear in my mind, and the mist of the forest lingering in my heart.
