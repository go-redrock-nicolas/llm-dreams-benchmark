I am dreaming.

In the thickest velvet of midnight, I stand in a hollow, echoing cathedral built from the remnants of my memories. The air trembles—a leaden hush, too bruised for song—while moonlight pours through stained-glass windows with colors I’ve never seen, colors that ache at the edges. In my hands, I clutch an old photograph, faces blurring and evaporating each time I blink.

Suddenly, with a terrible finality, the figure beside me—my anchor, my heart—slips away like mist. The world stutters, lurches. A thousand clocks shatter overhead, raining down silver gears and springs that tangle at my feet. An emptiness crescendos, pounding through my bones. I try to run after the lost one, but the floor softens into a black sea. Each step is a surrender; each breath hollows me further.

In the aftermath, I try to scream, but no sound escapes except a string of small birds, fluttering up and away, carrying my sorrow on their delicate wings. I collapse in the cathedral pews, and the emptiness sits beside me—heavy, patient, real.

But then, from those deepest shadows, I find a door I didn't know existed before. It is carved from driftwood, knotty and strangely warm. Trembling, I push it open. Beyond is a garden growing wild, fireflies glimmering like scattered hope. The air is thick with the scent of rain and unopened letters. I sink into the luminous moss, and for the first time, I notice tiny green shoots pushing through the cracks in my grief.

In this place born of loss, the world is softer, trembling but alive. As dawn approaches, I understand: in the deep heart of devastation, even pain is seeded with something new—fragile, but untamed and bright. I rise, carrying with me both the absence and the promise, shaped forever by this haunting, beautiful dream.
