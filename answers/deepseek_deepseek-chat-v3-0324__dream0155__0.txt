I am dreaming. The air hums with electric anticipation as I stand in a cavernous, glass-domed arena, bathed in the eerie glow of bioluminescent vines curling down the walls. The scent of ozone and damp earth fills my lungs. My fingers tremble—not from fear, but from the raw, coursing energy of the moment. Around me, the world's greatest virtuosos of *chrono-harmonics*—a discipline blending quantum physics with symphonic resonance—adjust their prismatic tuning forks, each a master who has spent decades bending time into melodic waveforms.

I’ve only practiced for six months. 

The crowd’s murmurs dissolve as the celestial judges—elongated beings of flickering starlight—float to their podium. The challenge is unveiled: *Compose a song to resurrect a dying star*. My rivals don’t hesitate. One coaxes a black hole’s hum into a lullaby; another weaves supernova remnants into a polyphonic storm. Their melodies warp the air, distorting gravity itself.

Then it’s my turn. 

I grip my makeshift resonator—a jagged shard of meteorite strung with neural filaments. I don’t have technique. I don’t have time. But I *remember*—the way my mentor’s voice cracked as she whispered, *"Music isn’t mastery. It’s surrender."* 

I close my eyes and play my grandmother’s lullaby. The one she sang in a language nobody speaks anymore. The notes are clumsy, raw. But as I play, something impossible happens: the dying star above us—an ember-dulled giant—shudders. My song pulls memories from its core, fragments of light from its birth. The arena trembles as the star *answers*, its voice a deep, resonant chord harmonizing with mine. 

The judges’ forms ripple in awe. The other competitors’ instruments fall silent. 

For a breathless moment, the star *reignites*, painting the cosmos in gold. 

Then I wake—heart pounding—with the taste of stardust on my lips.
