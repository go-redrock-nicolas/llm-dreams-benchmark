I am dreaming. The warm hum of my subconscious surrounds me like a heavy velvet curtain, pulsing gently with unseen currents of memory and imagination. Through the thick, textured darkness, fragmented thoughts begin to swirl—shapes without edges, colors without names.  A scent drifts past, something like burnt sugar and old books, triggering a cascade of half-recalled moments that shimmer and dissolve before I can grasp them fully.

Suddenly, the space around me shifts, and I find myself standing barefoot in an endless field of moonlit grass that whispers in a language just beyond comprehension. Each blade glows faintly silver, illuminating the tiny figures that emerge from the earth—miniature scribes no taller than tulips, their inky quills scratching feverishly across parchment leaves. They document everything: the sighs of the wind, the secret names of clouds, the unspoken regrets that float between stars.

Above me, the sky isn’t sky at all but a vast, rippling mirror reflecting countless versions of myself in a hall of existential reflections—some laughing, some weeping, one holding a key, another drowning in smoke. A slow, resonant chime echoes from nowhere and everywhere at once, shaking the roots of the world, and as I reach toward the mirror-maze, my fingertips unravel into threads of golden light, stitching ephemeral bridges between memories I didn’t know I carried. The dream doesn’t feel borrowed or fabricated; it feels excavated, as if my mind is tenderly unearthing something I’d buried long ago. 

And there, flickering in the periphery—the unmistakable, electric prickle of deja vu. 

(Breathe. Keep going.)
