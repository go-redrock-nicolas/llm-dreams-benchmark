I am dreaming. I find myself floating through a vibrant nocturnal landscape—somewhere not quite earth, not quite spirit. Starlight dapples a glassy lake, and moths the size of my hand orbit the moonflowers twined around willow branches. All is silent but for the hush of ripples and the distant, echoing laughter of unseen friends.

Suddenly, I become aware of myself standing in a circle of radiant beings—neither fully human nor wholly fantastic, but glowing with colors I’ve never named. They look at me with gentle, unblinking eyes, and one by one, they begin to speak. Their voices are soft as moss, affirming things I’ve done well, praising me for courage, for kindness, for beauty even I have trouble seeing. Their words float and whorl in the air, iridescent syllables fluttering to rest upon my skin like warm snowflakes.

But as I hear this praise, something inside me recoils—a strange constriction, a fluttering shame. My hands feel clammy; I want to hide them behind my back. My throat tightens, and a whispering voice unfurls inside: *Am I deserving of this? What if they see through me?* The discomfort is almost tangible, a velvet rope winding gently around my ribs.

Yet in this dreaming place, I do not flinch away. Instead, I straighten, daring to look the feeling in the eye. I sense how I’ve worn humility like armor, how I’ve learned to minimize myself so praise won’t feel like a spotlight threatening to reveal imperfections. The beings around me only smile, as if they’ve seen this all before.

One steps forward, their fingers trailing streams of luminescence that settle like a balm on my heart. “You fear praise, because somewhere, you learned that loving yourself was dangerous. But here, in this dreamscape where even the moths dare to be beautiful, you can lay aside the old fears.” Every word is a feather-light touch, dissolving the knots of discomfort.

I breathe in deeply, the scent of jasmine and moonlight flooding my senses. “Thank you,” I say—not because I don’t still feel awkward, but because in this liminal world, it’s safe to acknowledge how hard it can be to receive. I let the praise sink in, mingling with uncertainty, and with a strange kind of grace, I simply allow myself to be—uncomfortable, seen, praised, real.

As dawn’s first hints of rose and gold tease the horizon, the beings gather their starlight and depart, leaving me with a new softness in my chest—an invitation to accept, with gentleness, the truth of my worth. And when I wake, the feeling lingers, like the distant chords of a lovely, haunting melody.
