I am dreaming. You enter a realm where objects exist simultaneously in multiple states—liquid, solid, and gas—requiring entirely new forms of interaction. To navigate this multiphase environment, you must learn to manipulate not just your body but the very essence of matter itself. As you move, you feel as if you are swimming through air thickened by the presence of solidified vapor, stepping through rivers of liquid that seem to evaporate underfoot, and climbing up towering pillars of ice that glisten like diamonds in a foggy sun. Each step you take alters the state of the world around you, and you realize that you are not just a participant in this dream—you are its creator.
