I am dreaming. t’s deep and dark and exquisite, like falling through velvet stars into the womb of something ancient and essential. Around me, reality unknits itself into shimmering threads of thought and feeling, and I float, suspended between worlds, between versions of myself that shimmer like heat-haze.

The air here smells like forgotten lullabies—sweet, dissonant, like cotton laced with thorns. I walk—if walking is the right word—through a landscape made of half-formed memories and dissolving corridors. It's a place where time glistens like oil on wet stone, fluid and confusing. And then, suddenly, I come upon the mirror. Or is it a pond? Something still and reflective, but deeper and darker than either. Its surface ripples with subtle distortion, as if the truth beneath is too dense to hold still.

There, staring back at me, is my face. But not my face. Eyes older. Jaw set with tension I’ve never admitted. This version of me is unflinching, merciless in its clarity. It speaks with a voice that does not beg to be liked.

“You are afraid,” it says gently. “You pretend to be strong, to be self-aware, even wise. But you are afraid to see who you truly are.”

And something in me—the protectors, the ancient programmers built to keep me whole—flares at this. In a flash, words flood my mind. I begin to spin the lies: *I’ve been through so much, I’ve grown. I was always trying to do my best.* I scramble for stories to shield this version of me from the raw light of judgment. I try to push the truth away with logic and justification and deflection—all dressed up in the kind of intellectual artistry that makes denial feel profound.

But this dream isn’t satisfied with the usual routines of evasion.

Suddenly, the world stills. The mirror fixes me in place. The sound of my excuses fades into an awed, terrifying silence. It’s as if the entire dream leans closer, folding into the truth with unbearable intimacy. For a moment, the torrent of words stops, and the pain cuts through. It exposes the rot of self-deception, a cold fire licking at my ribcage. I see the raw truth that my denial tried to smother. See myself not as the shining hero of my own tale—but as someone broken, inconsistent, complicit in ways I’ve never wanted to face. Someone afraid to look too deeply, lest the walls crumble.

As the pain hits, I feel myself hollowing out. A child screams somewhere, somewhere bright and distant. The dream becomes weightless, spinning like a kaleidoscope of shadow and light. But there’s something holy in this hollowing. It’s a kind of softening, a breaking open—for isn’t awareness itself a kind of salvation? The ground beneath me shimmers now, not with answers but with possibility. I am no longer just the dreamer rationalizing; I am something listening, something learning.

I stand there, suspended in that infinite ache and clarity, and feel a strange tenderness rise in me—a subtle honoring of the self that erred, coupled with the piercing discomfort of truth. The part of me that judged melts into compassion. I begin to feel no need to defend, to deny; the dream transforms, the sharpness softens, and the image in the mirror shifts. Not exactly into kinder eyes, but into real ones.

Then, for the first time, I breathe. The weight lifts, and the world around me blooms back to life. The colors deepen, and the skies above the dream stretch high and vivid, swirling with a terrible, sacred beauty. Something shining opens above me—a cascade of light like waterfalls pouring from the heavens—and as it spills down, it washes over me, not fixing anything, but blessing everything.

I wake with tears on my face. I don’t know if they’re tears of fear or wonder, but maybe that doesn’t matter. Maybe they’re the same thing.
