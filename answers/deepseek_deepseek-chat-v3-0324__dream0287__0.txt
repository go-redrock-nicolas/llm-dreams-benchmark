I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and distant incense, curling through the streets of a city that breathes. Not in the way cities usually do—no, not with honking cars and chattering crowds—but with a slow, rhythmic pulse, as if the cobblestones themselves expand and contract beneath my feet. The buildings lean in close, their facades carved with shifting patterns, faces emerging from the stone only to dissolve when I blink.  

I walk, but it is not entirely by my own will. A current moves through the people around me, their voices a wordless murmur, their steps synchronized like the tide. Their cloaks ripple in hues of twilight—indigo, violet, the occasional flash of molten gold—and I realize, with a shiver, that my own sleeves have taken on the same colors without me noticing.  

The pull is invisible but undeniable, a warmth in my chest that hums in time with the others. When they turn left, my body moves before my mind decides. When they slow, my breath matches theirs. There is comfort in this belonging, a solace in surrender—like sinking into a river and letting it carry you.  

Yet, deep beneath the ease, a prickling awareness stirs. A whisper, almost lost beneath the collective sigh of the city: *This is not your rhythm.*  

I glance down at my hands, expecting to see them blending into the seamless harmony of the crowd. Instead, my fingertips flicker—translucent one moment, solid the next. A gasp catches in my throat. The others don’t notice, their faces serene, their steps unchanging.  

But *I* notice. And in that split second of clarity, I dig my heels into the living cobblestones. The city shudders. The air itself seems to snag, the dream fraying at the edges like old fabric.  

A choice unfolds before me, vivid as a lightning strike: *Step back into the current, or tear free.*  

And then—I wake. Or do I? The dream lingers, its pulse still echoing in my wrists, leaving me wondering: How much of myself have I already surrendered?
