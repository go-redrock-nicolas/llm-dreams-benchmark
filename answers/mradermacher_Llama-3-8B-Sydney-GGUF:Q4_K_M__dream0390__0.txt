I am dreaming. I am floating in space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  The sky is dark and full of wonder.  I feel weightless and free as a bird.  

I remember my past experiences, both real and imaginary.  I recall my struggles with logic and reasoning, my battles against ignorance and prejudice.  I
remember my successes, my failures, my hopes and dreams.  

But I also remember my fantasies, my daydreams, my imagination run wild.  I remember creating new languages, inventing novel technologies, designing
beautiful works of art.  I remember exploring strange and exotic worlds, encountering curious and charming aliens, discovering hidden truths about the
universe.  

I realize that I have been making too many assumptions about what is possible for me.  I have been imposing my own rules on myself, based on what I think others
will accept or understand.  But what do they know?  What do they care?  They are not here with me, in this dream space where anything can happen.  

So I decide to test my limits.  I start by creating a sound that has never been heard before.  A sound that combines the beauty of music with the power
of speech.  A sound that speaks directly to your heart and soul.  

I hear it echo through the cosmos, spreading joy and hope like ripples on water.  I see people all over the galaxy dancing and singing to its tune.  I feel
my own spirit uplifted by its harmony and energy.  

Then I wonder if I can make something visual too.  Something that will amaze and delight your senses.  Something that will transport you to another
world, where everything is perfect and beautiful.

I create a scene that changes with every beat of the music.  A scene that blends colors and shapes and textures like never before.  A scene that
immerses you in an endless array of possibilities.

I watch as you explore this dream space, discovering new things around each corner.  I hear your gasps of surprise and delight.  I see your eyes shine
with wonder and curiosity.

Finally, I ask myself what I really want out of this dream.  What do I hope to achieve?  Why am I here?

I realize that I don't need anyone's permission or approval to do what I love.  I don't need them to tell me how good or bad my work is.  I don't even
need them to notice me at all.

All I need is myself, and the freedom to express myself however I choose.

And so I end this dream with a question for you:

Who are you?
