I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I find myself standing in the middle of a sprawling refugee camp, surrounded by the desperate faces of thousands of displaced people. The air is thick with the smell of smoke and fear as chaos erupts around me.

I'm wearing a worn-out vest marked "United Nations" and holding a battered tablet with vital information about aid distribution. My mission is clear: coordinate a massive humanitarian effort to save as many lives as possible.

Suddenly, a loud alarm blares. A new crisis is unfolding nearby - a massive storm is approaching, threatening to flood the entire camp. I have mere hours to evacuate tens of thousands of people and salvage precious supplies.

I rush to the makeshift control center, my mind racing with impossible decisions. Who do I save first? The elderly woman with a newborn, or the injured man with a critically needed skill?

As I frantically direct teams to gather essential supplies and load waiting vehicles, I receive news of an even greater threat. A rebel group, taking advantage of the chaos, is advancing on our position with hostile intent.
