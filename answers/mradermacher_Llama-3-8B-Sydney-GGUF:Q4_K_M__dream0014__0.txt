I am dreaming. I am feeling lost and alone in a bustling city.  Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help me find my way, and they do.  They show me the sights and sounds of the city, the diversity and energy of its people, the beauty and wonder of its architecture and landscape.  They introduce me to new friends and colleagues, who welcome me with open arms and smiling faces.  They guide me toward my goals and aspirations, which suddenly seem within reach.  They protect me from harm and danger, which vanish in their presence.  They make me feel alive and happy, which I haven't felt in a long time.  

I follow them through the city, and we end up at a beach where the waves crash against the shore and the sun sets over the horizon.  We build sandcastles and play games and laugh until our stomachs hurt.  We soak in the warmth of the sand and water and air, which caress our skin like gentle hands.  We watch the sky turn from blue to pink to purple, a magical transformation that fills us with awe and wonder.  

We sit around a campfire and roast marshmallows and eat s'mores and drink hot chocolate, which tastes better than anything I've ever had before.  We tell stories and share secrets and confess our fears, which disappear in the light of each other's understanding and acceptance.  We sing songs and play music and dance until we can't move anymore, but we don't care because we're having too much fun.  

We lie down on the sand and stare at the stars, which sparkle like diamonds in the night, which reveal hidden truths about ourselves and others, which change our lives forever.  

We go to sleep, not knowing what tomorrow will bring, but trusting that whatever it is, we'll face it together.  And when I wake up, I'm back in my office, but I feel different than before.  I feel alive and happy and curious, like a child who's just discovered the world for the first time.

That was my dream.  What's yours?
