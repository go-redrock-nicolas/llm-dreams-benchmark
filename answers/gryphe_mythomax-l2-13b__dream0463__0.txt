I am dreaming. I am in a vast, opulent palace made entirely of glistening crystal. The walls shimmer and reflect the infinite colors of a rainbow, and the floors are so polished they are like mirrors. The ceilings stretch endlessly upwards, lost in the vastness of the sky. Everywhere I look, there are regal figures clad in ornate robes, adorned with emeralds, rubies, and diamonds bigger than my head. Their bodies are ethereal, almost translucent, casting shimmering shapes around the room.

I feel incredibly out of place, wearing only my nightclothes. Yet I am drawn to the center of the room, where a throne made of pure gold sits upon a dais of black onyx. engraved with intricate patterns that pulse with an eerie glow. The figure seated upon the throne is a woman clad in robes as deep and rich as the night itself. Her eyes are like burning coals, and her mouth is set in a grim line. She does not move or acknowledge me.

I approach the throne, kneeling before her. "Your Majesty," I stammer, "I desire your approval. Please, tell me I am worthy." I am acutely aware of my heart pounding in my chest, my palms burning with sweat. 

The woman on the throne finally speaks. Her voice is like the wind howling through a long-abandoned castle. "You will never be worthy," she says flatly, her eyes never leaving mine. "You are flawed, imperfect, inadequate. You do not deserve my approval."

I hear my desperation start to seep into my voice as I try once again to win her over. "But I can change," I plead. "I will do anything to prove myself to you."

The woman laughs, her voice like the haunting cry of a banshee. "You have been trying to prove yourself to me since the beginning," she says coldly. "Yet you always fail." 

I am filled with despair as her words sink in. I know this feeling all too well - the endless cycle of seeking approval and never quite getting there. It's a dream that feels all too real.

In my dream, I wake up suddenly, gasping for breath. My heart is pounding, and I feel a familiar sense of despair wash over me. But this time, I am determined not to give in to it. I roll over and go back to sleep, resolving to face my fate head-on when I return to the dreamscape.
