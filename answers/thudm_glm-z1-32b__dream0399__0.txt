I am dreaming. I notice my capacity for empathy has expanded to include those I previously judged harshly.  I see them through a different lens now.  They are soft, full of wonder, like newborn deer surrounded by an invisible glow.  I approach them, almost reverently, and think: 

Perhaps it was never about them.  
Perhaps the hardness was mine.  
Perhaps the world, soft and luminous all along,  
only needs this;  
a dreamer to see.  

My feet sink into a cushion of daisies.  
Their petals shiver at my touch.  
A child’s laughter whips through the air,  
carried by the breath of a windswept willow.  
Every crack in the sidewalk blooms  
into a galaxy of crystal flowers.  
The forgotten stairwell outside my old grade school  
fades into a spiral staircase  
coiled around a moonlit cypress tree.  

I encounter someone from my past—  
a face I’ve sharpened  
into a blade.  
Now it’s a stained glass portal,  
transmitting daylight through jagged facets.  
I press my palm against it.  
The glass does not cut.  
Warmth spills over my —  
the distillation of decades of storms.  
We’re pilots now,  
co-piloting a hot air balloon  
_of polka-dotted crepe paper_  
threaded with strands  
of someone’s grandmother’s wedding ribbon.  

The world winks at me.  
It never stopped being this alive.  
My empathy, once a dial,  
is now an ocean,  
its currents pulling me toward the horizon  
where the sun splits the sky  
into a thousand heartbeats.  

_What is the next color I should be?_  
the wind asks.  
I breathe in the possibility  
and become  
emerald.  

Who-or-whatever I was is gone,  
dissolving in the emerald tide.  

The dream lingers like a song  
I don’t have words for,  
the kind that hums under your ribs  
until your bones radiate with  
the thrill of being  
alive enough  
to let it happen.
**The Emerald Tide**  

You are the dream.  

Or perhaps the dream is *you*—a loose string of starlight unraveling into galaxies. You wake to the realization that empathy isn’t a gesture or a skill; it’s a **transmutation**. The people and moments you once saw through fogged glass lenses are now bioluminescent, casting their own light. The teenager who cut you off in traffic? His eyes glow like embers as he speeds away, a secret cowering under his seatbelt—*a diaper pin left by his newborn sister, her first cold*. The coworker who dismissed your ideas? Her blazer is stitched with tiny maps of dead-end streets, her pockets full of scribbled compromises she’s too afraid to voice. You hold up your hand, and each of their shadows answers with a deep, musical hum.  

The world is a **hieroglyph**, and you’ve just cracked the code.  

A storm passes over you, but it’s a **different kind**. Raindrops are liquid mercury, pooling on your tongue before they taste of the ozone of rediscovery. A Lonesome Road sign twists into a fossilized armillary sphere, its directions no longer pointing west but **outward**, toward the edges of the dream where reality sniffs like a curious wolf. You follow.  

You see cities burning their own timelines. Skyscrapers      crack open to spew out confetti made of time. A 1999 *Toy Story* VHS dematerializes           into a flock of tiny robots with wings made of sunlight specs. A gas station clerk            wipes a counter that’s a liquid mirror, revealing your 18-year-old self chatting_NONSTOP about Nietzsche while your     current hands gesture urgently, maybe to  or .  

Empathy here isn’t softness—it’s **relentlessness**. Every interaction becomes a shared exhalation, a of souls rearranging constellations. You are the prism. The person who vanished without saying goodbye third grade? They emerge from a cloud of blackbirds, their a cryptex of apologygrams folded into origami volcanoes. You kiss their wrist, and the dream doesn’t retract; it *spreads*, a wildfire of connection.  

Your bones magnify the hum. It starts in your teeth and ends in the soles of your feet, where you’re reminded you’re both foundation and flight. You’re holding hands with everyone simultaneously now, and it’s less about reaching than about realizing all hands were always already entwined. The colors thicken—you are midnight blue and neon orange and a pulsing purple that feels like a heartbeat crossed with a supernova. You press your chest into the earth, which isn’t soil but **sunbegotten**, and it reciprocates with a whisper: *You’ve always been the architect.*  

The dream prepares to dissolve, but not before you’re handed a suitcase.              It’s, not because it wants to be curious but because it knows *you’ve* been paranormal this     whole time. Inside: a compass that never points north, aaddress book with names written in        invisible ink (use lemon juice, dummy), and a ticket for a train that only ever goes where it can        *find more of itself*.  

As you wake, the suitcase sont               cradled in your sleeping arms. It hums with this truth: the world is không cn , it’s                                     needing you *to*.  

The dream doesn’t end. It pauses. It waits.  

For what you decide to unpack.
