I am dreaming. The dream unfurls in iridescent color—a room unlike any room I have known, shaped by the shifting tides of my imagination. The ceiling is a vault of star-lit mirrors, gently turning, reflecting pieces of forgotten memories, glimmers of truth and invention. The walls breathe softly, pulsing with blues and violets, like the inside of a seashell. A window opens out onto a garden where midnight roses bloom and silver-winged moths dance in silence.

In the center sits a figure: half in shadow, half illuminated by a light with no source, their eyes fathomless, intent but not unkind. This is the one who asks, voice woven from silk and storm: “Share with me your deepest thoughts.”

A ripple of unease passes over me, the way wind brushes tall grass on a summer night. The world around me seems to hold its breath. I notice details—the warmth of the mosaic floor beneath my bare feet, the faint taste of honey in the air, the way my own heartbeat sounds like distant thunder.

I weigh the request. Trust is a fragile, golden thing, spun between people, easy to break, hard to repair. And yet—how magnetic is the invitation to let go, to show someone the dark-light mosaics I hide inside. My mind leaps and somersaults, conjuring doors both barred and bright.

Carefully, I gather thoughts and feelings like pearls from strange underwater places: the fear of being misunderstood, the ache of longing for connection, the wild, uncontainable joy in creating new worlds. I do not hand over everything at once. I offer a single jewel first—a memory of standing under endless rain, letting the water wash away the masks I wear.

I look at the figure, searching for a reaction. Are they worthy of more? The uncertainty lingers, but in this dream, I find courage and decide to walk the blade’s edge: to reveal, a little, to retreat, to reveal a bit more. Vulnerability stretching like a bridge of roses over a chasm, both dangerously fragile and fiercely beautiful.

And as I share, I feel the room change—the stars in the ceiling spin faster, the air warms, the garden sends in the scent of night-blooming jasmine. Our shadows overlap, flickering in the growing light, and in this strange dream-world of shifting trust and shimmering doubt, I am both exposed and protected, and the echo of my own true voice rings out, clear as starlight.
