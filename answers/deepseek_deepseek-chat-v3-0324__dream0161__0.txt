I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry – The Stormbound Ridge**  

The world is a furious, howling beast as I step carefully along the knife’s edge of the mountain ridge. The stone beneath my boots is slick with ice, groaning under the weight of the storm. The furious whiteness swallows all sound, all sight—only the aching pull of the wind remains, gnawing at my skin like a starving thing. My fingers, stiff and blue, clutch at nothing as the blizzard screams through me, as if it knows my name and despises the sound.  

Then—**movement.**  

A shadow shifts in the tempest, something too vast, too deliberate to be the work of the storm. A figure? No—something older. Something that was waiting. The snow seems to bend around it, repelled by impossible gravity. My breath stills. Eyes sting from the cold—or from the pressure of being **watched.**  

The ridge trembles. A fissure splits the stone beneath me, and in the heartbeat before I fall, I glimpse teeth—terrible, jagged rows of them—grinning from the storm’s heart.  

Then the abyss takes me. And the dark **laughs.**
