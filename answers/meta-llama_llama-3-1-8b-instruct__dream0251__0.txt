I am dreaming. The world around me is a kaleidoscope of surreal colors and shifting textures, like a mad artist's canvas come to life. I'm standing on the edge of a glittering, turquoise lake, with a sprawling, Baroque-style opera house looming majestically behind me. The air is filled with a cacophony of whispers, each one a nagging doubt that my mind can't shake – "What if I fail?" "What if I forget?" "What if I say something ridiculous?"

The sun beats down upon my shoulders like a fiery weight, its rays shimmering with an otherworldly intensity. I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of uncertainty, adrift in a dream that's twisted into a labyrinth of reflections. Every step I take, every breath I make, seems to underscore the creeping dread that's spreading its dark tendrils through my mind.

The opera house, a towering monolith of marble and gold, looms over me like a specter of success. Its grand, sweeping curves seem to mock me, inviting me to step across the threshold, to prove myself worthy of its opulent splendor. But what if I'm not? What if, despite all my preparation, I'm a shipwreck waiting to happen, doomed to crash on the rocks of ridicule and scorn?

My thoughts swirl like a maelstrom, pulling me under with each new, paralyzing doubt. Can I really handle the spotlight? Will I stumble over my own words, like a puppet on a string? The questions leap into my mind like a chorus of crazed jugglers, each one competing for attention, wearing me down with their relentless barrage of worst-case scenarios.

I'm acutely aware of the countdown ticking away in the recesses of my mind – 60 seconds, 90 seconds, past the point of no return. My heart pounds in my chest like a wild drum, while my breath becomes a magnified, underwater scream. Each beat, each gasp for air, grows more labored, more desperate, as the clock ticks closer to disaster.

The opera house seems to be turning, slowly, its stone facade seeming to pivot on some unseen axis. The walls close in on me, their angles sharp as knives, pushing me toward a precipice from which there's no return. Panic claws at my sleeves, sending me jolting forward, like a puppet on a string, as my doubts seize me with cold, malevolent fingers.

All I want to do is find some tranquil place to sit, to calm the screaming voices in my head and restore a glimmer of confidence to my shattered psyche. But even that's denied me, as the lake begins to churn and foam, as if sensing my despair. Its waves start to rise, shaking the very foundations of my sanity. Is it the dream's demented comedic reaction to my neurotic, shrinking minuscule dreams? Can't I even seek refuge with the dish of Chan history wrinklin'?
