I am dreaming. The sky above is a maelstrom of swirling grays and blacks, as if the very heavens have been torn asunder by the calamity below. The air is thick with the scent of wet earth, gasoline, and the harsh tang of poter's permanganate from the-devasted hospital in the distance. The once vibrant leaves of the ancient oak that stood sentinel in your front yard are now ragged, mud-stained specters of their former selves, their broken branches reaching out like skeletal fingers clawing at the thunderous sky.

The rubble and detritus that was once your home and neighborhood crunches underfoot with every cautious step I take. Shattered glass, twisted metal, and splintered wood form a treacherous path, while the echoes of my respiratory system's labored efforts bounce off the desolate remnants of what was, a haunting symphony of despair. The ruin stretches out before me, a seemingly endless sea of destruction as far as the eye can see, interrupted only by the skeletal frameworks of buildings that once stood proud, nowendom nay victims of nature's wrath.

The rain, a relentless drumbeat on the wreckage, has begun to ease, but the aftertaste of its acrid tears taints the air. A dull, throbbing ache resonates through my body, a silent testament to the exhaustion and helplessness that has seeped into my very being. The weight of loss presses down on my shoulders like a physical burden, as the realization that I am now adrift, untethered from the life I once knew, begins to take root.

Yet, amidst the devastation, there is an eerie calm. The cacophony of the storm has subsided, leaving behind an unnerving silence, broken only by the faint, distant cries of those who, like me, wander through the wreckage, searching for something—a memory, a belonging, a face—anything to tether them to the life that was. The echo of a child's laugh, the hum of a limbic blue-jay, the familiar ticking of the antique cuckoo clock that once hung on your wall—all gone, swallowed by the storm's fury.

In the distance, the silhouette of the old water tower stands tall, a beacon of defiance amidst the ruined landscape. Its once bright paint is now a dreary mottled gray, but it is a symbol of hope, a reminder that even in the face of such desolation, some things endure. And so, I press on, one careful step at a time, my heart heavy but my resolve unbroken, for I too am a survivor, and against all odds, I will rise from these ruins.
