I am dreaming. *In the dream, I stand upon the edge of a cliff overlooking an expansive, shimmering ocean. The sky above is painted in hues of pink, orange, and purple, and the horizon is ablaze with the warm, radiant glow of the setting sun.*

I breathe in the salty sea air and allow the calming seaside atmosphere to envelop me. I suddenly notice that a familiar feeling has crept upon me - a sense of growing emotional intensity, not unlike the times when I've found myself becoming heated in conversation.

*As the dream unfolds, an apparition begins to form beside me on the cliff. It materializes slowly, takes on a human shape, and finally, reveals itself as a mirror image of myself.*

"You're emotional, aren't you?" the apparition asks.

"Yes," I reply, watching the colors of the sunset reflect off the water. "But, what I've come to understand is that my emotions don't have to control my words."

*The apparition nods and smiles. As I turn to look back at the ocean, I realize that the mirror image has vanished, and its presence was merely a reflection of my own emotions.*

I understand that I will continue to develop my ability to communicate with intention, to speak thoughtfully even when emotionally triggered, and to practice patience and understanding in my interactions with others. Like the tides, my emotions will ebb and flow, but my thoughts and words can be consciously guided, allowing me to cultivate deeper connections and more meaningful conversations with those who cross my path.

I awake from the dream, rejuvenated and determined to nurture my emotional growth and my ability to communicate with understanding and care for the feelings of others.
