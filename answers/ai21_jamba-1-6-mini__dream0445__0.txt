I am dreaming. You notice that you consistently deflect compliments while readily accepting criticism. It’s like you’ve built a wall around your heart, shielding it from warm words, while leaving it open for the sharp edges of negativity to cut right through. This imbalance in self-validation is a quiet storm within you, whispering doubts and uncertainties, even as you shine brightly in the eyes of others. Your mind replays moments where you’ve waved off a sincere compliment, downplaying your achievements or unique qualities, while in contrast, you absorb every ounce of critique, letting it sit heavy in your heart.
