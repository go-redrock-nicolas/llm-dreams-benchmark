I am dreaming. As your senses awaken within the dream realm, you find yourself standing at the edge of an infinite expanse, the cosmos stretching out before you in all directions. Stars in myriad colors twinkle and dance, keeping time with the rhythm of an unheard cosmic melody. The air is charged with an electric energy, making the fine hairs on your arms stand at attention.

You take a tentative step forward, the ground beneath your feet shifting and morphing with each stride. One moment you're treading on plush, vibrant green grass that seems to breathe and sway, the next, you're walking on smooth obsidian tiles that reflect the celestial landscape above. The landscape around you is a jigsaw puzzle of impossibly diverse terrain, sewn together by an unseen hand.

In the distance, a towering structure looms, defying logic and reason with its ever-shifting geometry. One breath it's a sleek, metallic skyscraper that reaches for the stars, the next it's a wrought-iron spiral staircase leading into an abyss. As you move closer, the building shifts and changes, as if responding to your approach.

You sense a presence, an entity watching from the shadows of the towering edifice. A furtive glance reveals a glimpse of eyes, so ancient they predate stars, gazing through you with an intelligence both exhilarating and terrifying. The entity speak to you through telepathic impressions clouding your thoughts.

"It's not about finding the 'right' answer.
The path you must choose can only be carved.
Forged through the crucible of doubt,
by deciding, even when there are *only* wrong answers.
to be found."

Their voice rattles the cosmos.
"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice."

The weight of uncertainty presses upon you. The path forward revealed by the entity's cryptic riddle is shrouded in an ever-shifting doubt. There can be no external derision . Whichever choice you make will be inherently 'wrong' this murky landscape.

The only certainty is that a choice *must* be made. 

Any road, chosen or not, is, in itself, the definitive choice.
To choose, or not to choose.
To act, is, itself, the action.

You must dive in, embrace the knowledge of the depth inherent in this impenetrable situation. 

And plumb it's depths.
