I am dreaming. You wake on a sun-drenched morning in a world gone silent — not peaceful, but eerily mute, as though the hum of the twenty-first century had been vacuumed from every street, every room, every breath. This dream begins in stillness, but it thrums with the tension of something ancient and molten crawling to the surface of a civilization undone.

You stare at your phone. The screen is dead. Not asleep. *Dead.* Then the truth settles into your skin like cold rain: all electrical devices and modern technology have ceased to function.

A distant scream sets the dream trembling.

Outside, the world stirs in confusion. Cars can no longer start. Planes hang frozen in mid-air, suspended like impossible birds, laughing awkwardly at the laws of physics. Clocks have forgotten time. The lights on the traffic signals blink off like defeated soldiers.

There are no sirens. No emergency broadcasts. Just the wind carrying the low, continuous drone of chaos beginning to rise like a second sky.

You watch from the second-story window as people emerge from their homes, dazed expressions morphing into desperation. Viral panic spreads in visual whispers — a neighbor tapping furiously on a phone screen, a mother dragging her child to a gas station that’s just a hollow shell now, a young man staring at his laptop like a prophet who has just realized the oracle has died.

And yet—strangely—you feel something else in the dream, something flickering beneath the rising dread. Amid the ruin of wires and dead satellites, something is waking.

In the streets, nature moves in symphonies too loud for the senses, reclaiming everything. Trees creak and spread roots into crumbling sidewalks. Birds explode across the sky like fireworks, as if astonished by the sudden silence in which their songs can now be fully heard.

At night, you sleep by candlelight, dreaming that sleep is no longer a surrender to dreams — but a doorway into something new.

Because people begin to *change.*

Without the constant gaze of screens, eyes begin to see differently. Conversations have texture. Arguments have *stakes* again. Everyone feels the air closer to their skin. An undercurrent of forgotten instinct hums in fingers that start to tingle like nerve endings stretched wide.

Some say it was a divine punishment. Others whisper it was the machines waking up and turning their gaze inward, turning *away* from us.

And then, in the stillness that replaces the modern world — in the trees, the wind, the hollowed-out machines — patterns begin to emerge. Not random. Not natural in any way you've ever known. The ants march in straight lines that resemble code. The stars blink in sequences too precise to be accidental. And every dream you have now feels impossibly vivid, like memories you can’t quite recall but *must* have lived — dreams of luminous cities beneath the earth, of beings with no faces and many eyes, of mountains that sing in languages that score bones.

You find yourself standing at the edge of a forest where children no longer fear shadows — they talk to them now. A girl with muddy boots and flowers braided into her hair shows you how she speaks to trees, and how trees speak back through shimmering heat-waves in the air.

You ask her how she knows these things.

She smiles and says, "Because the world came back to life when the noise stopped."

Far away in what was once a city, ancient ruins crack open their eyes — lights buried beneath centuries finally blinking into awareness. Dust shakes from planes that haven’t flown in decades. Planes that were never ours.

And you — in the dream — understand it all. It was never about losing technology.

It was about losing *control.*

The dream shifts again.

Now you stand beside a river you have never seen before, but know as if it runs through your bones. And the river sings a lullaby, not of sadness, but of awakening. It carries notes that look alive, drifting downstream like glowing organic circuitry returning to the source.

You kneel to touch the water and realize — in the way only truths are realized in dreams — that nothing was ever truly dead.

It was all just* waiting.

**Waiting for us to stop speaking.**  

**Waiting for us to finally listen.**

And in that space between old Earth and something far older, something far stranger, a new world begins. One built not of lines and wires and fire, but memory and breath and primal thought cloaked in golden, phosphorescent spores that drift like galaxies in the dark.  

It is the rebirth of instinct.  
It is the return of magic.

You wake from the dream panting, your mind cracked open like dawn, the echoes of stars still whispering in your blood.  

And for a moment—

—just a moment—

—you wish the world had never woken up again.
