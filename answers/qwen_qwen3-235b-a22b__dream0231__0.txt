I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt honey and ozone, and the sky above is a tapestry of shifting oil-slick colors, rippling like liquid glass. Beneath your feet, the ground is neither earth nor stone but a spongy, bioluminescent moss that glows faintly violet with each step. In the distance, a forest of crystalline trees stretches toward the horizon, their branches chiming in the wind like wind-up music boxes. You wander until you reach a clearing where time itself seems to pool—a circular expanse of sand that swirls with golden dust, forming and dissolving shapes: coins, hourglasses, blooming flowers, crumbling bones.  

A figure waits at the center. They are neither human nor beast but a fluid amalgam of both—a silhouette with antlers made of gears, eyes like twin supernovae, and a voice that resonates like a cello. In one hand, they hold a velvet pouch brimming with coins that glint like teeth. In the other, a single obsidian seed, its surface etched with spirals that seem to move when you squint.  

*"Choose,"* they intone, their words vibrating in your molars. *"The pouch empties now, and you wake with its weight in your pocket. Spend it on feasts, voyages, silks—fleeting fires that warm your hands tonight. Or plant the seed and wait. Wait through seasons of hunger, doubt, and longing. Wait until its roots crack the bedrock of your patience. Then…"* Their smile widens, revealing stars orbiting their teeth. *"…you inherit the tree that grows from it. A tree whose fruit are keys. Keys to doors you’ve never seen, doors that open to rooms full of… more."*  

The pouch trembles, spilling a few coins onto the moss. They hiss and melt into the ground, leaving scorch marks that bloom into ephemeral flowers—gorgeous, then gone. The seed pulses in your palm when you lift it, its heat syncing with your heartbeat. You imagine seasons passing in the dream: digging a hole with trembling hands, guarding the sapling from storms of locusts and doubt, watching it wither and revive a hundred times. You’d grow gaunt, hungry, *old*, but the tree… the tree would *sing*.  

But the pouch whispers too, its coins already clinking in your mind—*a feast, a ship, a night of laughter that fades like smoke*. You could wake with that. You could *taste* it.  

The sky fractures into a kaleidoscope. The moss beneath you hardens into clock hands, ticking forward. The choice sharpens like a blade.  

Do you clutch the immediate, let it slip through your fingers like sand? Or sink your teeth into the bitter pill of patience, trusting the ache will one day bear fruit?  

The dream waits.  

So do you.
