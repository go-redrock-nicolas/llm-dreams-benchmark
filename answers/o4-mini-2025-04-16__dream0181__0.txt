I am dreaming. You’re standing at the threshold of a great hall that seems to breathe. The walls ripple like liquid silver, and every surface is inscribed with glyphs that shimmer and shift their shape whenever you glance away. Light pours in from a vaulted ceiling carved out of a single, colossal opal. Its iridescence paints the marble floor in waves of violet and teal.  

A hush falls as you step forward. At the dais, an enormous crystal orb throbs with living color—each pulse echoing in your chest like a second heartbeat. A circle of thirty or forty figures is arrayed before you—seasoned commanders in gilded armor, robed scholars clutching tomes bound in dragonhide, and stern-faced advisors whose eyes hold centuries of hard-won wisdom. They exchange glances heavy with skepticism.  

When a silver-trussed herald announces, “By decree of the Eternal Conclave, you are henceforth Supreme Arbiter,” the crystalline orb flares brighter and casts dancing rainbows across the hall. A soft breeze ruffles your hair—though you feel no wind—and the entire room seems to inhale.  

One by one, the subordinates step forward to challenge you.  
• The grizzled marshal with scarred cheeks thumps his fist on the marble floor: “Commander? You haven’t even studied tactics!”  
• A scholar in cobalt robes tips her spectacles and hisses, “Where are your treatises on arcane jurisprudence?”  
• A lithe warrior-priest, her sword humming at her hip, sneers, “When was the last time you led an army?”  

None of them know you, and they gather as though ready to tear your new title away. Your palms prick with sweat, yet the crystal orb continues its steady glow, as if urging you on. The glyphs on the walls curl into new patterns—runic encouragement you can almost read in the corner of your mind.  

You take a slow breath. The hall seems charged with anticipation, as if the very air is waiting to see whether you will rise or crumble. Then, without thinking, you reach out and trace a finger across the surface of the orb. At your touch the light ripples outward in a silent shockwave. The subordinates’ lips part, the buffet of doubts silenced for a heartbeat.  

In that instant, the orb reveals a vision:  
–A labyrinthine city built on stilts above an endless sea of clouds where crises are cured by a single word of kindness.  
–Mountain fortresses lit by bioluminescent vines, their gates swung wide in greeting rather than defense.  
–A conclave of rival kingdoms, long at war, kneeling together around a table of crystal and flame.  

You withdraw your hand, breath caught in your throat. The vision fades, but its promise remains—an unspoken testament that authority need not be earned by blood or parchment alone. You turn to face the circle of doubters. Their eyes, fed by centuries of tradition, blink in surprise. Somewhere deep inside you, a steady pulse answers the orb’s rhythm: steady, certain, alive.  

And then you speak—your voice a quiet tide rolling through the hall. As the first clear words leave your mouth, you feel the hall itself lean in to listen, the orb’s glow aligning with your heartbeat, the future bending around the single, impossible idea that true authority rises from unexpected places. In this living dream, you realize you’ve never felt more ready.
