I am dreaming. As the path becomes increasingly treacherous and your extremities begin to numb, you lean forward into the blast of wind, each gust carrying a hundred tiny ice arrows that sting your cheeks. The ridge beneath your boots narrows to the width of a finger, and every careful step feels as if you’re walking the razor’s edge between the world you know and some untamed other realm. Ahead, the swirling veil of white briefly parts, and you glimpse the silhouette of a solitary pine, its gnarled branches bowed under the weight of snow—a silent sentinel beckoning you onward.

With each labored breath, your lungs fill with cold fire, and the world becomes a muted symphony of howling winds and the crunch of frost beneath your feet. Your fingers have gone numb now, and you realize you can’t feel the hilt of the ice-axe you clutch. Still, you press on, guided by a flicker of distant, amber light that shimmers through the blizzard like a promise. Somewhere below, the roar of an avalanche echoes—an ominous drumbeat that quickens your pulse. Yet at the edge of terror, there’s a curious thrill: you are alive, unbroken, and tethered to this frozen mountain by nothing but your own will.

Then, without warning, the ridge dissolves beneath you into a mist of glistening shards. You flail, heart pounding, and for an instant drift—weightless—between earth and sky. In that impossible weightlessness, you feel the numbness recede, replaced by a warm wave that surges from your chest to your fingertips. The swirling snow transforms into a cascade of glowing butterflies, each one flickering with pale blue light, guiding you toward a hidden alcove sheathed in crystalline ice. Inside that secret hollow, the wind is a gentle hum, and on its floor lies a perfect mirror carved from frost. Leaning over it, you see not your own frozen face, but a galaxy of stars swirling in deep violet depths—an invitation to follow, to step through and discover what lies beyond the frozen mountain’s edge.
