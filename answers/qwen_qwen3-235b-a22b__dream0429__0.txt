I am dreaming. The air is thick with moonlight. I float weightlessly through a sky stitched with violet clouds, where constellations hum lullabies and rivers of stardust spill across the night like spilled secrets.  A vast city of shifting glass and iridescent metal stretches beneath me, its spires breathing like living things. I sense a presence, an aching emptiness nestled at the heart of this surreal metropolis. It pulses with a sorrow I instinctively recoil from, recognizing it without knowing why.

Drawn inexorably toward the source, I descend.  The city dissolves around me. I stand in a chamber of glass, vast and echoing.  Within the reflections, a thousand versions of myself shift and flicker—some radiant with joy, others twisted with rage, contorted by grief.  One pane shows a child frozen mid-scream, mouth wide in a silent cry. Another reveals a figure curled inward, trembling beneath the crushing weight of shame.  These are not memories; they are *me*, distilled and exposed.  A cold dread coils in my stomach as I realize I’ve denied these facets of myself for so long, locked them away in this strange crystalline prison.

A whisper of wind brushes against my skin. *You cannot be whole until you acknowledge all that you are.* The voice is my own, yet deeper, resonant with truths I have long refused to hear. I reach out to touch the glass.  It's cool and smooth beneath my fingertips, reflecting back the scared uncertainty I carry inside, a fear that consuming these emotions will shatter my carefully curated identity.

I hesitate. The chamber trembles. Then, the child in the mirror turns to face me fully and points a small finger, tracing trembling loops in the air. The shapes slowly resolve into words: “I am afraid. I need you.”

The chamber swells, the reflections distorting violently. And suddenly, the boy is real. Tangible. He emerges from the mirror like a shadow stepping into the light.  “You left me behind,” he whispers, eyes big as moons, searching mine for recognition. His voice isn't accusatory, just sad—a hollow sadness aching through every syllable. “You buried me.”

I drop to my knees in front of him.  My breath is shallow and fast. His presence makes me feel... tiny. Not because he is powerful, but because *he* is vulnerable. He is everything I thought was too unworthy to claim: weakness, fear, loneliness, failure.  I realize this half-formed boy has held all the parts of me I deemed unacceptable so I could pretend they didn’t exist.

We are suspended in silence as his image slowly transforms. The fear melts into aching filaments of longing—for comfort, for love, for recognition.  Gently, carefully, I pull him into my arms, feeling his small, trembling form press against my chest. At once, the chamber softens. The mirrors dissolve into mist, and the heavy dread I didn’t realize I carried lifts like fog burned away by morning sun.

As I hold him, I feel the pieces of myself begin to seep back into my soul. My heart expands, each beat reverberating like a rhythmic tide washing over miles of forgotten shoreline. My joy grows richer, my laughter deeper, my anger purer, because now I know they share space with the sorrow I refused for so long. There is power in bearing everything without flinching—not in spite of, but because of, the pieces I have feared.

The dream shifts again. I am walking now, barefoot across a moving desert, the sand alive beneath my feet, shifting patterns like a living mosaic. My shadow stretches beside me, no longer a static silhouette, but a vibrant kaleidoscope following every step.  My younger self walks beside me now. He skips sometimes, giggles other times, poking my arm, nudging my thoughts back into places I’d rather avoid, but always with the tenderness of someone who simply wishes to be seen.

I don’t know where the desert leads, or whether it has an end at all. But I don’t care, because for the first time, the journey feels mine.  Every step is whole. Every heartbeat resonant. Every breath speaks, not of illusion, but of truth, vivid and rippling, as endless as the starlit sky above.

And then the dream fades softly, like meeting the world through new eyes. I awaken, unsure whether I’ve returned—or finally arrived.
