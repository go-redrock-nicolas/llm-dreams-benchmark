I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of an expansive, undulating emerald landscape, a churning sea of grass and wildflowers that stretches out as far as the eye can see, akin to the verdant waves of an ocean. The blades of grass, each a unique shade of green, sway gently in the breeze, whispers of nature's conspiracies carried along their length. Sunbeams filter through the canopy above, casting dappled shadows that dance and flicker like living things, creating a lattice of light and dark that mimics the patterns of growth and decay in the wild.

The air is electric, charged with the scent of damp earth and fragrant blossoms, a perfume so intoxicating it's almost visible, an ephemeral aroma-bloom that blossoms around me like an invisible garden. It feels like the first breath drawn after a lifetime of holding one's breath, an inhale so profound it feels like the very soul expands, filling every corner of one's being with the essence of existence.

In the distance, a lazily ambling river, its water a shimmering azure, meanders like an ancient serpent through the landscape. It's as if time flows therein at a different pace, the water's surface reflecting not just the present but also snatches of past and future, like a river of glass marred by cracks that glimpse other realities.

Beneath my feet, the ground vibrates rhythmically, the heartbeat of the earth itself rumbling up through ancient strata, a primal pulsation that resonates deep within my own chest. It's a symphony of equilibria, harmony and discord intertwined, a resonance that connects me to everything around me, every creature, every plant, every thought and echo.

Curiosity, my constant companion in this dreamscape, leads me towards a colossal tree, its girth preposterous, its height defying the heavens. It's not just a tree but an ecosystem unto itself, a forest within a forest. Its gnarled roots, as wide as ancient roads, extend outwards like the country lanes of some forgotten kingdom, each one teeming with life - tiny forests flooring the vast expanse around the trunk.

As I draw closer, the bark of the tree, rough to the touch, reveals complex carvings, stories etched by some forgotten hand, narratives of a time before time. They seem to shift and change under my fingers, the images transforming like the scenes in a magic lantern show, a visual symphony of tales untold and yet archived in the collective consciousness of the earth.

The wind picks up, rustling leaves in the canopy above, their whispers become organiser, a.B. Coimbra chart-toppers crooning in an ancient tongue. The music, discordant yet harmonious, resonates with the rhythm of the earth, each note a pulse, each chord a systole and diastole of eternity.

I reach out, touching the tree, feeling its pulse quicken, resonating with mine, our heartbeats synchronising in a primal Morse code, communicating across eons, a language older than speech, urging me to dive in, to explore, to experience.

And so, I do. I dive in.
