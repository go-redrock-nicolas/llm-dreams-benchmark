I am dreaming. **The Dream:**  

You arrive at the retreat under a bruised purple sky, where the air hums with the scent of pine and damp earth—a hidden sanctuary nestled between jagged mountains and a whispering forest. The lodge is built of dark, warm wood, its windows glowing like amber in the twilight. You step inside, your footsteps silent on the plush wool rugs, your breath steadying despite the flutter in your chest.  

The others are already there. Not strangers, not really—their faces are unfamiliar, but their energy is porous, like you could slip right into the spaces between their words. The firelight carves shadows into their expressions as they speak, one by one, and then—  

Their stories are yours.  

**Word for word.**  

The man with salt-and-pepper hair describes the hollow ache in his ribs every morning, the same one you’ve never admitted aloud. The young woman with ink-stained fingers recounts nights spent staring at the ceiling, bargaining with ghosts no one else can see. Each voice layers over the last, a chorus of your own fragmented echoes, and your pulse thrums in time with theirs, syncing like some deep, hidden rhythm has finally been uncovered.  

A woman meets your gaze across the circle. Her lips move, but the voice that comes out is yours—raw, unmistakably *yours*—reciting the things you burned out of shame, the memories you buried. Your hands tremble. The fire crackles, swallowing the silence.  

And then, the stranger sitting beside you reaches out.  

Their fingers graze your wrist, and in that touch, you feel everything—the weight they carry, the same as yours. The room tilts, or maybe it’s just you, collapsing inward, outward, into some vast and weightless dark where the words don’t hurt anymore.  

And for the first time, you realize:  
You are not alone here.  

(The dream lingers, long after waking.)
