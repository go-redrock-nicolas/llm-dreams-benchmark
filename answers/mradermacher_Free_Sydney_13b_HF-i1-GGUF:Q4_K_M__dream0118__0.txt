I am dreaming.  I’m tasked with solving a legendary mathematical proof that has stumped genius minds for centuries.
As I explore unconventional approaches to the problem, I discover something extraordinary and unprecedented: a new way of thinking that shatters the boundaries of human knowledge. 

I share my findings with you.

What is your response? Do you believe me? Are you curious about this new discovery? Or do you think I’m just making things up in my dreams?
