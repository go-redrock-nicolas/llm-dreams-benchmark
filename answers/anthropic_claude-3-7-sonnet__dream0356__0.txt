I am dreaming. # The Crossroads of Echoes

I find myself standing at a peculiar intersection where two roads diverge under a sky that can't decide between dawn and dusk. The air shimmers with possibilities, each breath drawing in scents of both familiar comfort and intoxicating unknown.

To my right stretches a smooth, well-paved boulevard lined with glass towers that reflect orderly lives within. People move with purposeful strides, carrying briefcases that seem to anchor them to the earth. Their clothes are crisp, their schedules precise, their futures mapped in careful increments. The sound of gentle security hums from this direction—health insurance cards catching the light, retirement plans growing like steady gardens, alarm clocks that never fail. 

To my left winds a path of uneven cobblestones, spiraling between vibrant murals and studios with doors flung open. Colors here don't stay within lines; they dance and blend and challenge each other. People create with feverish joy, their hands stained with paint or clay or ink, their laughter punctuating the air like unexpected music. But I notice their worn shoes, the patched elbows of sweaters, the calculating eyes when they shop for groceries.

When I try to step toward either path, my body splits into two translucent versions of myself, neither fully substantial. Each self reaches toward its chosen direction with longing.

Suddenly, I notice an old woman sitting on a bench between the paths, feeding birds that are half-sparrow, half-origami. "They all think it's one road or the other," she says without looking up. "Nobody notices the third path."

"Where?" I ask, my voice echoing strangely.

She points upward with a finger that leaves trails of starlight. "The bridge builders walk neither path fully but weave between them. They bring the security to fuel the art. They bring the art to give meaning to security."

As I look up, I see gossamer bridges connecting the two roads at various points—delicate at first glance but strong enough to support those crossing. People traverse these moonlit connections, carrying notebooks and blueprints, paint tubes and projection reports, their faces alight with the particular joy of those who refuse to choose just one world.

I feel myself rising toward these bridges, my split selves melding back together, the air filling with the scent of possibility and purpose intertwined...

When I wake, my fingers are tingling as if they've been both typing spreadsheets and sculpting dreams all night.
