I am dreaming. …open my eyes inside the dream to find myself standing on a staircase of interlocking feathers, each step rustling like distant applause. The stair curls upward through a column of violet mist and deposits me in front of an impossible building: the Harmandala Conservatory, a palace carved from prismatic salt, its walls ringing with glissandos whenever a breeze slips through its crystalline fret-work. A brass plaque, warm to the touch, informs me—quite matter-of-factly—that I have been accepted into the Midnight Coterie of Aural Alchemists, a sect so selective that even rumor dares mention it only in counter-melodies.

My knees nearly buckle. To belong here one must already wield the esoteric craft of lucent-thread weaving: the ability to braid raw sound into physical form—lattices, creatures, even weather. I have studied it for perhaps three chaotic weekends, never mastering more than a faint pearlescent ribbon that fizzles at the first wrong note. Yet the plaque’s inscription glows with unquestionable authority: Orientation begins now. Recital before the Grand Council in three nights.

The foyer unfolds like the interior of a kaleidoscope: mirror-shard chandeliers, echo pools in place of rugs, doorways that modulate their key signatures instead of their shapes. An attendant cloaked in parchment scrolls glides toward me; his voice is the rustle of pages turning themselves.

“Welcome, provisional virtuoso,” he whispers, handing me a baton feathered with shards of dark moon. “Your studio is at the end of Corridor C. It will test you—teach you, too, if you listen.”

The corridor crooks and elongates with my every step, as though measuring the tempo of my heartbeat. Doors flash by marked “Silversong Topology,” “Subharmonic Botany,” “Applied Reverberation Physics.” Mine bears no words—only a pulse, like a lighthouse of rhythm. When I grasp the handle everything tilts; the room is simultaneously above, below, and inside me.

In the center floats a loom woven from clock hands. Beneath it rests a silent lyre whose strings are made of pure dawn. I approach, pluck a tentative note, and a single strand of sunrise unspools, knotting itself into a wavering helix before evaporating. The loom clicks reproachfully. Across its frame an inscription flares: Craft demands courage louder than fear.

I practice. Hours blur into bars and measures. Each mistake fractures the walls into fractal sheet music; each small triumph resews them with richer harmonies. By the second night I can coax melodies that condense into origami swans of phosphorescence, though they still dissolve after a single wingbeat. Exhaustion stalks me, but wonder keeps pace, urging me on.

When I finally collapse on a chair woven of metronomes, a figure emerges from the corner: Maestro Belen, legendary for weaving the thunderstorm that crowned a king. She steps through a curtain made of her own sustained chord, placing a hand on my shoulder.

“Technique is ink,” she says, eyes glinting like treble clefs. “But dreams are the quill. Tomorrow you do not prove perfection—you prove presence. Offer the Council the thread of your becoming.”

Her words pour into me like warm percussion. I sleep, though the dream within the dream roils with chromatic lightning.

Performance night arrives. The theatre is an inverted amphitheater hanging from midnight clouds. Audience members—sages, spirits, personified constellations—sit upside down on velvet rafters, their applause trickling upward like golden rain. The Grand Council occupies a dais forged from harmonic convergence; their robes are woven from suspended silences.

I take the stage, baton trembling. The first note cracks; panic claws my throat. Instead of retreating, I remember Maestro Belen: presence. I close my eyes and hear the earliest sound I ever loved: my mother humming while washing dishes on a summer afternoon. I play that unassuming lullaby. Warm, imperfect, human.

The air shivers. The melody threads outward, tangling with the theatre’s architecture, lightening the dark rafters into honey-colored dusk. From the loom of my heart I weave scenes of memory: my childhood backyard, fireflies pulsing like quarter-notes, friends laughing off-key, the scrape of pencil on homework. None of it is virtuosic, yet every image gleams with lived resonance. The swans I once fashioned return—not fragile now, but sure-winged—spiraling upward to perch among the constellations, aligning themselves into new star charts.

When the final chord dims, silence becomes cathedral-vast. Then a low resonance swells from the Council—approval, not as thunderous applause, but as a harmonic that lifts me off my feet, weightless, buoyed by acceptance. I realize they were never testing my polish; they were waiting to see if I would dare offer the raw thread of self.

As I drift backward, theatre dissolving into aurora ribbons, a single phrase etches itself across the sky in luminous script: Mastery begins where vulnerability sings.

I awaken in my own bed moments later, the dawn outside paling like spent applause. On my nightstand lies the moon-shard baton, faintly thrumming with promise.
