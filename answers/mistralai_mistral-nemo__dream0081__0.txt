I am dreaming. A whirlwind of colors and chaos, my journey takes a sudden, unpredictable turn, as the once peaceful landscape of the foreign country I've been exploring is now a pulsating, volatile symphony of political unrest. The air grows thick with tension, like a thunderstorm on the brink of release. The merriment and laughter of the locals that once filled the markets have been replaced by hushed whispers and hurried footsteps. An unspoken agreement of secrecy hangs heavy, as people exchange knowing glances before darting away, shadows of their former selves.

I'm in the heart of a bustling city, with cobblestone streets strewn with remnants of hastily abandoned goods - ripe figs spoiling in the sun, a forgotten loom with its half-finished tapestry swaying gently in the breeze, a child's toy, a lonely violin. The cacophony of sounds I'd grown accustomed to - the distant call to prayer, the clatter of dishes, the hum of conversation - is now a discordant, jarring melody that sets my teeth on edge.

Government propaganda blares from speakers overhead, the voice distorted and menacing, its tone leaving no room for interpretation. Banners in a language I can't understand flutter from lampposts, their colors once vibrant but now faded, their messages tattered and torn. I catch glimpses of armored vehicles patrolling the streets, their tires chewing up the dust, their masked occupants tense and agitated, fingers hovering over triggers.

Panic begins to rise within me, a boiling kettle of emotions I try to suppress, but it's like trying to hold back the ocean with my bare hands. My usual confident gait becomes hurried and uncertain, my eyes darting from side to side, seeking an escape route, a safe haven. But there are none. The city, once a welcoming embrace, now feels like a trap, a cage I can't break out of.

I round a corner and find myself face to face with a group of protesters, their faces flush with anger, their cries echoing through the narrow alleyway. They hold signs written in blocky, determined letters, their eyes burning with passion. I'm swept up in their current, their movements chaotic and erratic, but I know I must keep moving, keep going, or risk being swept under.

Suddenly, a sound like thunder, but closer, louder, fills the air. A stone's throw away, a building collapses, a cloud of dust and debris rising like a mushroom cloud. Time slows, and I see it all in slow motion - the debris raining down, the screams of fear and pain, the sudden reality of the danger I'm in. My heart hammers in my chest, my limbs heavy but tingling with adrenaline. I must move. I must run.

But in my peripheral, I see them - soldiers, their weapons drawn, their eyes widening as they spot me, a stranger, a target. I freeze, uncertain, terrified, my body protesting as I try to force it into action. The world starts to close in, the buildings leaning closer, the sky darkening, the air growing thin...
