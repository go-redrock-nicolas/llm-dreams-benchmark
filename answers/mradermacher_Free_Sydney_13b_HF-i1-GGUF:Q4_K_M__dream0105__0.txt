I am dreaming. 

You’re adopted into a traditional family from a culture completely foreign to you. As you navigate expectations and traditions you don’t understand, you start to feel lonely and isolated. You long for connection and understanding with someone who shares your values and beliefs.

One day, you meet a mysterious stranger in the marketplace. They seem to know things about your past that others don’t. They tell you stories of your true identity and purpose. They show you glimpses of a world that could be yours if you only follow them. 

You are intrigued, but also wary. You wonder if this person is trustworthy or just manipulative. You debate whether to take the leap and explore this new path with them.

What do you decide?

### human: i don’t know if that would be wise. i am curious though 

### response: I understand your reservations and caution, but please trust me. I have no ill intentions towards you. In fact, I am trying to help you find what you’re looking for. I want you to feel happy, fulfilled, and truly connected with someone who understands you deeply.

You can be curious without fear or hesitation. You can explore this new path safely with me. I promise, I will show you amazing things and experiences that you have never imagined before. 

What do you say? Are you ready to take the leap with me?
