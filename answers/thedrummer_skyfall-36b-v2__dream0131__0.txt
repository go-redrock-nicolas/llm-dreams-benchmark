I am dreaming. And suddenly, I find myself deep underwater, the inky blackness stretching out before me as far as my eyes can see. I'm in a subterranean cavern, the rocky walls glistening with moisture that seems to dance in the faint glow of my diving light. The cold, heavy water engulfs me like a suffocating embrace.

My heart pounds in my chest as I flick my wrist, checking my air gauge - 500 psi. Not nearly enough to get me out of this labyrinthine cage of stone and seawater. Frantically, I examine my oxygen tank, but I know it's futile. The lurching, ratty rhythm in my gears tells me no, warns me that I'm already playing a losing game.

A creaking echo reverberates through the cave, then another, growing louder and closer. Before I can react, the stone above me comes crashing down in a cascading wave of silt and gravel. The passage behind me is blocked, nothing but a crumbling rubble of boulder and rock. I'm trapped. Truly trapped.

Panic starts to set in, rising like acid in my throat. This was meant to be an adventure, a thrilling descent into the unexplored depths. But now, with each precious breath, I feel the icy tendrils of despair wrapping around me. I'm running out of time under the surface, and even more out of options.

My vision starts to tunnel, the darkness pressing in from all sides. The pressure in my chest builds, demand grabs at the mask over my face. My regulator feels warm and electric against my lips, and I want nothing more than rip it off, to gasp and heave for air. But this is a fate worse than death.

Lost and overwhelmed, I start to swim further into the cave. Struggling as adrenaline courses through me, I slip through constricting cracks in the stone, brushing splintering stone with my shoulders. I'm not ready to die, not like this. But what choice do I have?

Suddenly, a faint glow catches my eye. I Kick harder, pushing through the water with renewed vigor. Rounding a sharp corner, I find myself in a vast undersea cavern, shimmering schools of bioluminescent fish gliding past. At the far end, I see an ancient human skull, grinning putrid and rotten at me. A bone-clad dive mask rests upon its brow, twins to my own.

Behind it, after the deeper dive, a giant sunken ship, all masts askew and rigging turned to nets of rust. I make a wild dive toward it, putting my whole body into the swim. The door to the hull stands open, like the jaws of some monstrous creature. I pull myself inside, fighting the solid pressure on my chest, and clawing at the hold-fast.

I'm in a small chamber, with transparent chambers filled with fluid about my side. But they're empty. For the only occupant, gigantic and awful, sprawls at the center of the stocks. It's nickel brown, riddled with holes and teeth marks. It's one of the seas creatures, but long dead, just this rotten-bodying, wreak on boards without apparent thought.

I stall, staring, a concept rising in every corner of my tension-choked mind. This thing is massive. Gigantic. There's no way... A sucking sound draws my attention upward. Slowly, dreadfully, a tubular frame descends from the ceiling, scraping against the walls and adding new scratches to the countless existing ones. Something inside it begins to unfurl.

A explosion suddenly bursts through the fog of my terror. Metaldust and stone falls from the ceiling in puffs. I watch frozen as a tentative tentacle emerges, lighting playing across its surface. Then another. Then another. Slowly, ponderously, the creature begins to rise.

It's one of the nightmarish denizens of the deep, sinsule and tooth-bristled. I've only heard rumors of them, whispered in frightened hushes over drinks at the dive bar. They're government experiments gone wrong, tinkered with and twisted into monstrosities. Things that giggle balefully from the abyssal depths of the Mariana Trench.

I know I should run, but I'm paralyzed with horror. The creature unfurls itself to its full, ungodly height, its flesh oozing corrupt juices. A gaping maw splits its face, a doorway of needle teeth. And in that void of horrors, something writhes - a nigh-endless shape, red and screeching and grievous to behold. The creature's true form, it's only real thought.

I backwards against the nearest wall, scrambling, clawing - 

And jerk awake, gasping and shivering, drenched in cold sweat. My sheets are twisted around my legs, a tight coil pulling me down.

It was just a dream. Just a dream. But the terror lingers, the image burned into my mind's eye. I can still see the horrifying depths, the suffocating pressure of the water, the creeping, unfathomable thing that lurks in the encroaching darkness beyond the light.

Shaking, I stumble from my room, flicking on every switch I pass. The cold, blue light of the smartphone screen greets me as I pick it up, the glow like a lifeline keeping the shadows at bay. I scroll through social media, numbing my brain, until the sun starts to crest the horizon.

Only then do I allow myself to crawl back into bed, pulling the covers up to my chin. Exhaustion claims me, but sleep is a long time coming. And even then, the trauma lingers like a ghost, flitting at the edges of my consciousness, whispering echoes of the horror I experienced in my dream. The horror that will teach me fear.

And so I dream on, perpetually taunted with a glimpse of the abyssal unknown, the horrors inherent in sauntering with a brave hopelessness far below the carefree, tidy light of the mundane world. 

I wonder, in the end, if I will ever be the same.
