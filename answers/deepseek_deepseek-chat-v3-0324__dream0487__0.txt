I am dreaming. The world around me shifts like warm watercolor paints bleeding into one another—the edges of reality blurring, softening. The air hums with an inexplicable electricity, and I find myself standing in a vast, moonlit meadow drenched in silver-blue light. The grass beneath my bare feet is impossibly soft, each blade glistening as though woven from strands of liquid starlight. Above me, the sky is a swirling cosmos, galaxies twisting like slow-motion storms, their brilliance so near I feel I could reach up and pluck a handful of stars.

And then I see *it*—a lone dandelion, its delicate puff of seeds trembling in an unfelt breeze. So ordinary, yet it arrests me completely. My vision tunnels. My throat tightens. My heart convulses in a way that makes no sense. *It's just a weed,* I think, but the thought is swallowed by a surge of emotion so profound it staggers me. 

Tears streak my cheeks, hot and sudden. I kneel before the dandelion like a pilgrim before a relic, trembling with a grief I don’t understand. But it isn't grief—not exactly. It's something more tangled: nostalgia for a past I never lived, love for something I’ve never known, longing for a home that doesn't exist. The dandelion glows faintly, its seeds catching the starlight, each one carrying the weight of something unspoken. 

A whisper curls through the air—not a sound, but a feeling: *"You’ve forgotten how to be fragile."* 

The wind gusts suddenly, and the dandelion dissolves into a thousand luminous fragments, swirling around me like fireflies. They settle briefly on my skin before lifting away, rising toward the swirling sky. I gasp, reaching for them, but they’re already merging with the stars—returning to something greater. 

The meadow darkens. The stars blink out one by one. 

*Just a dream,* I tell myself. 

Yet when I wake, my pillow is damp. And for days after, I find myself staring at weeds cracking through sidewalks, aching in a way I cannot name.
