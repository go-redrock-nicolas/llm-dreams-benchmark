I am dreaming. You find yourself in a cathedral of rose-tinted sunlight. The high-arched windows dapple the polished marble floors with shifting patterns of cerise and gold. The walls themselves hum with distant choral whispers that almost sound like your name—over and over, a gentle echo reverberating in the air.

Suddenly, footsteps resound behind you. You turn, and there stands a figure cloaked in shimmering fabric, their face blurred and brilliant, as though made of streaked morning light. Their voice resonates throughout the hall, celebrating you for a modest action you only vaguely recall—a selfless kindness you extended without a second thought. Yet here they are, awarding you praise fitting a grand triumph, a lavish laurel for a moment you barely remember.

As you take in these words, you feel a swell of warmth in your chest, a vibrant glow of reassurance that reveals hidden corridors of your own self-worth. With every breath, the cathedral’s colors deepen, your senses heighten, an awareness awakening within you of how small gestures can reshape entire worlds. You sense your spirit unfurling, blossoms of gratitude opening in your heart, and you realize—like the crystals in the stained-glass—there is a hidden radiance within you. Then, caught between surprise and satisfaction, you accept this praise, letting the recognition settle in. The figure inclines its luminous head in approval, and you trust, in that fleeting reverie, that something grand and gracious exists within you. 

And just before waking, the cathedral doors swing open, pouring in brilliant dawn light, indistinguishable from your own enkindled confidence.
