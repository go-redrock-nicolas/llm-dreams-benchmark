I am dreaming. Soft light spills through the windows, casting a warm glow across the room. The scent of pine and fresh earth fills the air as the retreat unfolds before me. 

Faces blur, yet their words are clear. Strangers dare to speak what has long been trapped, unvoiced, within the deepest recesses of my heart. Like echoes from a forgotten cavern, their stories mirror my own secret battles, coaxing forth whispers and fears that have lingered in the shadows of silence.

Tears bloom, breaking through the guise of equilibrium. In this sanctuary of understanding, I find myself shedding layers, inch by tender inch. The warmth of camaraderie envelops me, as those around me weave their tales of heartache and small victories, creating a canvas of vulnerability that holds no room for judgment.

Despite the tapestry of varied lives, each narrative becomes a vessel for my own story. With every shared struggle, I feel a small flame of recognition igniting within me, forging a collective resilience that extends beyond the limitations of my isolation.

In this dream, solace emerges from unexpected quarters. I awaken with the sensation of a new chapter beginning, tethers loosening, as the retreat's nurturing essence lingers within me long after the sun slips beneath the horizon.
