I am dreaming. You're a doctor in charge of triaging patients who need urgent care after a catastrophe. This is not your first rodeo so to speak but it's worse than any other. The chaos outside makes things worse too. You don't have enough help or supplies and the orders you receive conflict with each other. Doctors from different teams argue and disagree about priorities which makes everything worse..
