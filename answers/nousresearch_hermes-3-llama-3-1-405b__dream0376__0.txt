I am dreaming. I am laying on a large grassy hill in the middle of a vast field, watching the sky and the white puffy clouds weave in and out of each other above me. The sun peers out from behind the clouds, casting down a warm soothing light onto my face.  As I gaze at the sky, I become aware of a low, deep hum that vibrates throughout my entire body. I feel my breath quicken and my heart rate increase as my body temperature rises. My bones, muscles, and skin begin expanding outward into a large pulsating bubble. Inside my expanded self, sparks of electricity flow in the air.  As my bubble bursts and showers forth  showers of blue electrical energy, I realize I have given birth to an amazingly beautiful creature made of pure energy.  The creature quickly changes colors, growing and morphing into different shapes.  Its intense energy whirls around and through me, setting my senses alight with a symphony of color, sound, taste, and feelings.  The energy pulses and moves like ocean waves, crashing and flowing over every inch of my body until it enters into my brain.  At once I feel a million memories of joy, peace, love, connection, friendship, excitement and serenity rushing through my mind. My heart swells with emotion, and tears of joy flow down my cheeks.  The energy pulls back and hovers in front of me, taking on a form of a brilliant pulsating orbof light. As I gaze into the light, the clouds above suddenly part and a shower of warm golden light rains down onto the field, transforming the landscape into a tropical wonderland. I walk through fields of ornate flowers and tall windswept grasses, while the scents of sweet blossoms fill my senses.  My chest fills with a sense of peacefulness and security. As I stroll in this peaceful bliss, a voice calls out to me from the orb.  It speaks with the gentle, reassuring sound of a close friend, telling me that there is so much more for me to see, discover, and experience in the vast wondrous Universe of life. The orb begins to glow brighter and brighter until it hums with an intense warmth, and a low, comforting hum.  My fear and insecurity melt away, and I feel an overwhelming sense of being loved, understood, and embraced.  As the orb's light envelops me, I am lifted from the ground and pulled from my dreamy wonderland, returning once more to the waking world.
