I am dreaming. `

---

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and distant rain, the kind that clings to your skin like a whispered secret. I stand in a hallway that stretches endlessly in both directions, its walls lined with doors—some ajar, some locked, some pulsing faintly, as if breathing. The floor beneath me is made of shifting tiles, each one etched with fragments of memories, half-remembered conversations, and promises that now taste like ash on my tongue.  

Then, I see *them*—the person I trusted—standing at the far end of the corridor, their silhouette blurred at the edges, like ink bleeding into wet paper. They’re holding something, a box, its lid slightly open, and from within, whispers slither out, curling around my ankles like serpents. I step closer, and the whispers sharpen into words—*lies*, all of them, every syllable a betrayal I hadn’t let myself see before.  

The hallway shudders. The doors begin to slam shut, one by one, the sound like a hammer striking bone. The floor tilts, and suddenly, I’m falling—not down, but *through*, into the space between truths. I land in a room made of mirrors, each reflection a different version of them, each one mouthing a different excuse, a different fabrication. Their voice splinters into a chorus, and I clap my hands over my ears, but the sound is inside me now, echoing in the hollow of my ribs.  

Then, silence.  

A single mirror remains, unbroken. In it, I see myself—but my reflection reaches out, presses a finger to my lips, and says, *"You always knew."*  

The dream fractures.  

I wake with a gasp, the taste of copper in my mouth, the weight of the unsaid pressing down on my chest like a stone.
