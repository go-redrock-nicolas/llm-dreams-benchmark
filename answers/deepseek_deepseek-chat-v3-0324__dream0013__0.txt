I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric charge, thick with the scent of damp stone and something faintly metallic, like the ghost of old machinery. The walls of the maze rise high above me, carved from smooth, obsidian-black stone that seems to drink in the dim, shifting light. It pulses faintly, as though alive—or dreaming itself.  

The first puzzle looms before me: a vast, circular door etched with glowing, labyrinthine symbols. They twist and rearrange themselves when I blink, as if daring me to keep up. My fingers hover over the surface, and the symbols respond to my touch, spiraling into new configurations. A riddle whispers through the air, not in words but in sensations—a cold prickle at the base of my skull, the weight of unsolved mysteries pressing against my ribs.  

I step back, thinking. The maze watches.  

The deeper I go, the more the puzzles evolve. One chamber holds a floating constellation of geometric shapes, each rotating in impossible defiance of physics. To pass, I must align them into a pattern that exists only in the periphery of my vision—if I look directly, it dissolves. Another corridor narrows into a hall of mirrors, but the reflections are not my own. They show versions of me from other dreams, other lives, some smiling, some screaming. The real test is choosing which one to follow.  

Time bends here. Minutes stretch into hours, or perhaps it’s the other way around. The maze breathes, its walls shifting subtly when I’m not looking, rerouting itself like a living thing testing my resolve.  

And then—the heart of it. A vast, open chamber where the ceiling opens to a swirling nebula of colors that don’t have names. At its center, a final puzzle: a sphere of liquid light, containing every question I’ve ever left unanswered. To solve it, I must let go of logic. I must *dream deeper.*  

I reach out—  

And the maze dreams with me.
