I am dreaming. **I am dreaming.**  

The air around me hums with the electric buzz of fluorescent lights, casting sharp, artificial shadows across my cluttered desk. Papers tremble in an unseen draft, whispering secrets in rustling tongues. My computer screen flickers, its glow sickly and pale, illuminating the exaggerated lines of my boss's face as he looms over me like a monolith carved from pure expectation.  

"You have until midnight," he says, his voice a distorted echo, as if spoken through a tunnel of water and static. His grin stretches too wide, teeth glinting like shards of glass. The clock on the wall ticks in reverse, each metallic *click* vibrating through my bones.  

I reach for my keyboard, but the keys squirm beneath my fingertips, tiny living things that scuttle away when I press them. My coffee cup trembles—no, not coffee anymore. A thick, inky liquid swirls inside, reflecting the ceiling, which is now impossibly high, stretching into a void dotted with pale, watching eyes.  

*Focus. Focus.*  

The project brief materializes before me, words melting and reforming into an eldritch script I can’t decipher. The deadlines shift—midnight? No, in five minutes. No, yesterday. My coworkers around me have frozen, their faces blurred, their postures stiff like mannequins waiting to be animated.  

A chill creeps up my spine. The floor beneath me is no longer carpet but a thick, breathing membrane, pulsing subtly with each panicked inhale I take. I try to stand, but gravity shifts, pinning me to my chair as shadows coil around my ankles like serpents.  

And then—  

A whisper from the vents, a voice that isn’t a voice, only *thought* shaped into sound:  

*"You were already too late when you started."*  

My hands fly to the keyboard, fingers mashing nonsense into the document as the walls begin to bleed ink, spreading like a slow, inevitable tide, swallowing the room, the world, the dream itself—  

**Then I wake.**
