I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast library that defies all architectural logic. The ceiling spirals upward into infinity, shelves extending in impossible directions, some sideways, some upside-down, yet books remain perfectly in place. The air tastes like cinnamon and old paper. As I walk, my footsteps echo with whispers of forgotten languages.

I'm clutching a strange device—a translucent orb that pulses with blue-green light. On its surface, symbols and equations constantly shift and rearrange themselves. A soft voice emanates from somewhere: "You have until the midnight bells to understand it all."

The information I must memorize materializes as luminous strands of text that float through the air. When I reach out to touch them, they dissolve into my fingertips, sending jolts of knowledge directly into my mind—histories of civilizations that never existed, mathematical principles that bend reality, poetry in languages born from storms and starlight.

As I absorb more, the library transforms around me. Books begin to hover and open themselves, their pages fluttering like wings. The knowledge feels physically heavy, pressing against my consciousness, making the air thick and difficult to breathe.

Time behaves strangely. Sometimes I stand before a single page for what feels like hours, other times I consume entire shelves in moments. My mind expands uncomfortably, like a balloon stretched beyond its capacity.

The midnight bells begin to toll somewhere distant, but with each chime, the sound draws nearer. The orb in my hand pulses faster, more urgently. The knowledge I've gathered swirls inside my mind like a tempest, fragments connecting into patterns I almost—but not quite—comprehend.

Just as the final bell is about to sound, I realize the truth: I am not meant to memorize this information; I am becoming the information itself.
