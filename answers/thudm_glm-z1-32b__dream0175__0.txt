I am dreaming. The world around me is a kaleidoscope of fractured colors, sharp like shattered stained glass. My body feels weightless, yet rooted to a path that twists endlessly upward.  The air hums with a frequency that vibrates in my bones.

Before me looms a mountain not of stone, but of liquid mercury. It shimmers, constantly changing shape, reflecting distorted versions of myself in its surface. The slope is vertical, liquid metal cascading down in silver rivulets that hiss faintly as they touch the ground. My boots slip on the slippery surface; each step sends ripples across the mercury's surface, momentarily revealing glimpses of the nothingness beyond the mountain.

Higher up, I see the next challenge—a bridge woven from living vines that writhe and. Each vine pulses with a different rhythm: some thrum with the steady cadence of a heartbeat, others jerk erratically like overstimulated nerves. The bridge sways precariously above a chasm filled with swirling galaxies. Stars scream their light into oblivion as they plunge downward. Crossing requires me to control the vines' rhythms, to harmonize their pulses, but they resist, their patterns bleeding into mine, distorting my own heartbeat.

Beyond the bridge, a chamber made of mirrors. Each reflection shows a different version of me—some triumphant beyond recognition, others broken, their eyes hollow pits swallowing light. In the center of the room, a door made of smoke. To open it, I must confront the reflection closest to my waking self. That reflection steps forward, not as an echo, but as a living thing. Its fingers press against the glass, and the world flickers, then resolves into a new dreamscape.

Now, here stands the final trial. The ground is a shifting desert of quicksand. Each stride sinks me deeper, but the sand also climbs the sides of my boots, weighting me down. Above, the sky rains obsidian shards, each one razor-thin and glinting with unnatural blue fire. I must walk forward while dodging the falling shards, but the ground gives way unpredictably. My arms are a blur as I keep myself from completely submerging, the obsidian cutting through my sleeves, leaving trails of smoke where they impact.

In the distance, a silhouette awaits—a figure composed of intersecting mathematical equations, their variables glowing with different hues. As I approach, the equations unravel, revealing a door frame where letters and numbers have coiled into a handle. Turning it requires solving the equation that forms the doorknob: (x³)+7=2345^2^x sin(t²)dt. The numbers and symbols dance before my eyes, mocking my attempts to compute.

My mind races, calculations spilling out in colored afterimages—each digit a prism refracting light into rainbows. The integral's limits flash neon, the cube root seems to shift with my focus. I'm not sure if I'm solving it or the equation is solving me. When the doorknob glows blue, the door opens onto a starless blackness. The figure turns, now wearing my face, and whispers, "You were never meant to pass." Without a word, I step through.

On the other side, floating in the void, are all my past failures, not as mistakes, but as crumpled paper boats. Each boat sails toward me, their forms transforming into possibilities I had abandoned. I gather them, each one feeling heavier than stone, and tie them into a raft. As I push off from the void's edge, the mercury mountain and the living vine bridge rise around me, but now they are lines of support rather than barriers. The obsidian rain slows, descending as gentle tears that ease pain into memory. The equations become constellations, guiding my raft toward a new horizon where the shore is a question mark made of liquid starlight.
The dream unfolds like a fractal endlessly expanding within my subconscious. The mercury mountain's surface catches the light of bioluminescent microbes swirling in the quicksand, their violet glow casting constellations on the liquid slopes. My boots leave imprints that don't vanish but evolve into crystal ammonites with my footprints preserved in their spiral chambers. 

The living vine bridge pulses with electroluminescent mycelium networks visible under my palms, each touch causing bioluminescent sparks to leap between my fingers and the vines. The chasm below reveals not galaxies but swirling nebulae of deprecated computer code—millions of green hexadecimal numbers dissolving into quantum foam as they fall. 

In the mirror chamber, the reflection wears my face but has three eyes—the central one glowing with the blue light of a GPU rendering nightmares. When we meet, the glass between us dissolves, and we share a synesthetic memory: tasting the sound of a deflating tire as chalk dust on desert lips. 

The obsidian rain etches kanji into my skin—each shard writing a character that contradicts the last ( for fire, then  for ice, each appearing like temporary tattoos that fade before the next strike). The equations on the doorframe aren't static but alive, with variables shifting based on my heart rate. The integral's upper limit becomes a fractal of my own DNA helix, the dx transforming into a mandala of my childhood home's floorplan. 

Past failures as paper boats reveal hidden compartments—each contains a microcosm of a life I might have led. One boat holds a tattooed monk meditating under a digital moon, another contains a city made of Vocaloid lyrics. When I tie them together, their anchor is the obsidian rain now fallen as liquid quartz, forming a klein bottle sail that catches the stardust from the crumbling mercury mountain. 

The new horizon's question mark shore isn't just liquid starlight but a Möbius strip of helical DNA where each base pair contains a parallel universe's version of this same dream. As I approach, the horizon eats the lightness from my bones, leaving me both lighter and more dense than I could imagine, like a neutron star made of stardust and solved equations. The void breathes, and in its exhale, I find the final test: the act of remembering that waking was also a dream.
