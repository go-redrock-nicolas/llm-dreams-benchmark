I am dreaming. find yourself standing in an otherworldly forest where the trees are impossibly tall, their trunks silver and leaves the color of bruised violets. Smoke fills the air, swirling in uncanny patterns—sometimes shapes, sometimes the faces of things you half remember from childhood dreams. The fire advances with a strange intelligence, tongues of blue-green flame licking hungrily at roots and boughs.

Heat presses in from all sides, each breath heavy with the scent of scorched earth and wildflowers gone to ash. The sky above is a tapestry of copper and crimson; embers spiral upward like restless stars. Your pulse thunders in your ears as the ground cracks beneath your feet, the heat warping your vision, making the forest crouch and shudder as if alive.

Suddenly, the shimmering shape of an animal—part wolf, part something else—emerges from behind a fallen log, its eyes reflecting the fire’s wild dance. It fixes you with a gaze both urgent and reassuring, nudging you with its nose in the only direction untouched by fire. With nowhere else to turn, you follow, weaving between burning roots and through a haze of memory and smoke.

Underfoot, the earth softens to moss; around you, the flames slow and recede as if held back by an unseen barrier. The wolf-creature leads you to a hidden hollow, where water runs crystalline and cool, untouched by the chaos outside. You collapse beside the stream, lungs aching but grateful, as the wildfire rages just beyond the shelter—a furious, living boundary, threatening, yet somehow held at bay by the strange, unspoken magic of this secret refuge.

The burned air shimmers in the clearing’s boundary, but within, a gentle breeze stirs the violet leaves and the wolf curls beside you, a guardian born of the dream’s deepest logic. In this surreal refuge, you sense a lesson: that even in the wildest, most desperate storms, imagination and wonder can carve out oases of hope, hidden just behind the flames.
