I am dreaming. I awake in a world where natural laws fluctuate unpredictably — gravity, time, and causality shift without warning. To accomplish even basic survival tasks, you must outsmart and outrun Mother Nature’s moods.
The landscape is wild and untamed — rugged mountains, vast deserts, thick forests, icy tundra. The air is thin, the sun hot, the wind cold. The sounds of wildlife echo around you — howls of coyotes, screeches of eagles, chirps of squirrels, growls of bears.
Your first task is to find shelter from the elements. You spot a cave entrance carved into the rock face by ancient rivers. You enter and find a spacious chamber with smooth walls, a high ceiling, and a warm floor. You claim this space as your home for the night.

But you can’t relax just yet. You hear noises outside the cave — footsteps, voices, rustling leaves. You peer through the opening and see four figures approaching — two men, two women.

They are not human. They are alien creatures from another planet who have come to conquer Earth and destroy all life. They are armed with deadly weapons that can disintegrate matter into energy or transform it into another form.

You realize they have detected your presence. They start to climb up the rock face toward the cave entrance. You must act fast to prevent them from entering and ending your dream (and maybe your life).

You grab a nearby rock and throw it at one of the figures, hitting him in the head and causing him to fall unconscious. You repeat this action with the other three figures until they are all lying motionless on the ground.

You then close the cave entrance and seal it with rocks and debris. You check your surroundings for potential threats such as predators or natural disasters but find nothing dangerous nearby.

You sit down near the center of the chamber where you feel safest and most protected. You take off your shoes, socks, pants, shirt, and underwear until you are completely naked except for your skin which glows with a healthy pink color due to exposure to radiation from space debris.

You reach out with both hands and touch your own chest just above your heart where you feel an intense warmth radiating from within you like a miniature sun burning brightly inside you despite the darkness outside

You close your eyes and imagine all sorts of wonderful things that could happen tomorrow when you wake up for real
