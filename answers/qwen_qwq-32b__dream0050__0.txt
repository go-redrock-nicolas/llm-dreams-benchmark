I am dreaming. The invitation came in a scroll of iridescent moth wings that hummed faintly when unrolled. The gatherers are seated in an evergreen circle beneath a tree with bark like polished obsidian. Its branches drip not with leaves but with crystal orbs that chime when wind passes through them. The ground beneath my feet is spongy, covered in moss that shifts subtly to match my mood—cool blue when I’m curious, warm gold when I feel out of place.

The group greets me with shared glances; their hands brush against invisible cords connecting them all. A woman with a crown of bioluminescent vines murmurs my name before I can speak. Next to her, a young man weaves a small tornado between his fingertips while listening to the person beside him. There’s laughter that’s woven into the air like threads, a melody that only exists here. 

The first exercise is tactile. A cauldron bubbles with liquid starlight. They ask me to dip my hand in. The warmth is immediate, alive. When I pull my hand out, my skin is temporarily tattooed with shifting constellations. The woman with the vine crown traces one with her finger. “They say the stars move when someone new joins,” she comments, her voice echoing slightly.

There’s a rupture in the tree’s trunk—a door-sized opening we’re instructed to walk through. Inside, it’s endless winter but the air is sweet, scented with blooming orchids. We’re given instruments made of bone and glass to play. When I strike the bone flute, it whistles in harmony with thoughts I didn’t realize I harbored. The group plays a dissonant yet somehow beautiful symphony that fades slowly, leaving the silence ringing.

Later, they teach me to dance on a tightrope strung across a canyon of mirrors. Each misstep sends shockwaves of color rippling through the glass below. The mirrors reflect not my image but scenes from possible futures—some grim, others radiantly hopeful. The dancer beside me whispers, “Choose your footing wisely.” 

The gathering ends at the hour of indigo—neither day nor night. They hand me a seedpod harvested from the crystal tree. It hums to my pulse. “Plant it where you live,” the bone-flute player says, their eyes crinkling at the edges. “When it blooms, you’ll remember how to weave the wind.”

I awake breathless, the phantom hum of the seedpod still in my palm, the taste of starlight on my tongue.
