I am dreaming. You gasp as the ceiling shudders again, unleashing a roar like titanic lungs releasing breath. Dust chokes your throat; each inhale snarls in your chest like a trapped wolf. All around you, shards of plaster and jagged beams press into your skin—cold, unforgiving. A neighbor’s muffled sob drifts past: someone pinned by a twisted steel girder, her fingers scraping the rubble in vain. You want to call out, but your voice is buried beneath the grinding roar of settling concrete.

Then, through the choking grey, a thin vein of pale light snakes down from a fissure overhead. It flickers, bluish and trembling, like quartz veins in a dark, living mountain. You crawl toward it, fingertips grazing grit that tastes of rust and sand. Every inch feels as if you’re moving through molasses, but the light pulses with promise. Beyond it, the world seems vast, a cathedral of fractured hope.

Somewhere to your left, a child’s cry shatters the hush of panic. You press your hand against your ear, straining to catch the pitch. Even as the walls groan, threatening another collapse, you find a shard of resolve. You clasp a fallen piece of beam—its grain splintered but solid—and lever the debris off the young girl’s leg. Her eyes meet yours, wide with terror, but in their depths you glimpse trust. You inhale and taste determination, bitter but invigorating.

As you pull free, the building sighs, sending a swirl of golden dust drifting through that narrow shaft of light, dancing like fireflies in a tomb. You lead the way, each step a promise: together, you will find an exit. Above you, the trembling concrete begins to sing a new song—a low, hopeful hum. In the dream’s heart, in the ruins of panic, something ancient and fierce stirs. You press on, breathing deep, a stubborn spark lighting the darkness ahead.
