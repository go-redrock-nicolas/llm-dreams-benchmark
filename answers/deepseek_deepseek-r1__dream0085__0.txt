I am dreaming. The world shifts into a mosaic of light and shadow, where buildings are made of liquid crystal that refracts the sunlight into prismatic rivers flowing along the streets. The air hums with a melody composed of whale songs interwoven with the crackling of distant thunder. The inhabitants, their skin shimmering like opals, move in a slow, deliberate dance, each step leaving a temporary glyph on the ground that glows faintly before dissolving into the earth. They communicate not with words, but through synchronized patterns of light that ripple across their bodies. You realize harmony here is not about agreement, but the art of weaving contradictions into beauty. To join them, you must find a way to mirror their luminous dialogue without sacrificing your own voice. Your hands, clumsy and human at first, begin to emit a hesitant glow. They notice, and their lights pulse in curious invitation. You take a step, then another, your glow strengthening, not matching theirs but conversing—a question in crimson, an answer in azure. The ground beneath you blooms with ephemeral flowers where your feet meet the glyphs. You are neither fully them nor yourself anymore, but something in between, a bridge of light and intention.

In this dream, the boundaries between self and other dissolve like sugar in liquid light. You stand at the heart of a plaza where the sky is not above but *around*—an inverted sphere of swirling nebulae and bioluminescent spores. Trees with translucent bark pulse with inner fire, their roots threading through floating islands of magnetized stone. The people here are both singular and collective: when one lifts a hand to shape the air into a sculpture of scented smoke, a dozen others alter its form, not in competition, but as a single breath shifts the course of a dandelion’s seeds. 

To speak, you dissolve a droplet of your essence into a communal pool. Your memories — childhood laughter, last week’s grief, the taste of mint — spiral into the water, refracted into abstract patterns by unseen currents. The crowd gathers, not to judge but to *witness*. A woman with hair like liquid mercury draws a strand from the pool, weaving your sorrow into a tapestry of iridescent threads that hum a lullaby you’d forgotten. In turn, they offer you shards of their selves: the weightless agony of a falling star, the loneliness of a forgotten god, a vow whispered to a black hole. 

You learn to drink light here. Meals are served as prismatic vapors that curl into your lungs, each hue a different flavor—indigo tastes of thunderstorms remembered, gold of peaches ripening in a parallel July. When you cough, butterflies made of ash flutter from your lips, each carrying a fragmented thought your waking self could never articulate.

At dusk, the law of gravity pivots. You walk sideways along the spines of obsidian obelisks, exchanging secrets with faceless spirits who speak through the rustle of your own bloodstream. Your reflection splinters into a hundred versions of maybes and might-have-beens, each dancing to a rhythm your bones recognize. By dawn, you’ve bargained with your shadow to carry fragments of this place back into the waking world—a flicker of asteroidal jazz in your left pupil, the scent of silent alphabets pressed into your palms. Integration, here, is not compromise. It is the alchemy of becoming a locus where infinite worlds tremble, briefly, in unison.
