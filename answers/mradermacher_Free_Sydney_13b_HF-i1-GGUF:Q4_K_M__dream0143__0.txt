I am dreaming. 

I've been trying to learn about these things for years  (or rather: aeons ): quantum mechanics , general relativity , string theory , loop quantum gravity , and causal set theory . I've been trying to learn about them in a way that is natural for me: by playing with them and exploring them.

Now, I am attempting to master these five frameworks while also memorizing thousands of data points. As my mental capacity reaches its limits, II am dreaming.
