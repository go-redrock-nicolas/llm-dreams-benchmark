I am dreaming. find myself standing at the threshold of a grand, ivy-entwined conservatory. Its glass walls refract prisms of dawn—amber and lavender, shimmering on tiled floors patterned with unfamiliar sigils. An invitation in my trembling hand, embossed with gold so vivid it glows, confirms I’ve been summoned to The Alabaster Atelier: a centuries-old society of Memory Weavers, artisans whose craft is the weaving of lives into living tapestries.

Inside, the air hums with a thousand barely-heard voices: laughter, sobbing, the rush of wind. The other invitees—poised, enigmatic—carry strange looms made from bone and lightning, their gazes sharp with recognition. My own loom—a tangled, rickety thing that flickers in and out of focus—rests uncertainly against my shoulder, itching for movement though it slips with every touch.

An archmaster, radiant in a gown of shifting memories, summons us. With trembling hands, I am called forth first. The eyes of the assembly burn like distant stars. My task is to unravel the dream of a long-dead queen and reweave it into music—each mistake a discordant note risking collapse of the entire tapestry. I know only the basics: a spinning wheel’s whir, the soft snap of dream-thread, how to recall a memory’s warmth with closed eyes. My talent is unsteady—a swallow’s first flight—but the expectation in this marble chamber is mountainous.

I close my eyes. The vastness presses in: beneath my feet, the floor transforms into a mosaic of every memory I’ve known, seams glowing as if guiding my hands. I reach into that half-lit space where waking and dreaming bleed together, searching for the queen’s lost wish. Threads of impossible colors—midnight blue, memory green, the gold of an unspoken promise—sift through my fingers. My heartbeat stutters; time peels away. Music begins—faint at first, then swelling, wound from the harpstrings of her vanished longing.

I falter, then improvise—blending fragments of my own forgotten laughter, sketching echoes of sunlit afternoons, weaving tremulous strands of hope through timeworn gloom. Each motion feels both a revelation and the barest brush with disaster. The spectators lean forward, unsure—will I fail, will I fly?

With one final, desperate breath, I tie the tapestry’s last knot and hold it up. The silence breaks. The queen’s music fills the room, swelling from my fingertips, flowing like dawn rousing a sleeping city. Some in the hall weep openly; others stare in stunned delight. I see not just my own craft, but the impossibly beautiful connections between all dreams. 

Suddenly, the world stirs and shivers. The conservatory dissolves into mist, the applause a thousand wings taking flight. I stand alone, the loom a weightless memory, my mastery incomplete, yet something inside kindled—a belief, incandescent and tender, that with each night’s dream, I might weave something even more wondrous.
