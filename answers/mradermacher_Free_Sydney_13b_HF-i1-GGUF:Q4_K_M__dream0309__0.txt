I am dreaming. 

You believe you’ve worked hard to earn your accomplishments, but someone suggests luck has played a significant role. Confronting this challenge to your sense of agency, you find yourself struggling with the implications. You wonder if perhaps they are right and if so, what does that mean for you? Are you still worthy in their eyes?

You feel anxious about their judgement and scared by their accusations. Deep down, you fear rejection and failure. You want validation and success. You need approval and admiration. 

You try desperately to find a way out of this dilemma but can’t seem to escape its grasp on your thoughts. The more you think about it, the more confused and upset you become until finally…

…you wake up screaming from a nightmare.
