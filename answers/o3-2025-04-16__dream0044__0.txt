I am dreaming. …reach out and knock on the nearest door, its surface fashioned from weather-worn turquoise planks that shimmer ever so slightly, as though moonlight has seeped into the grain. The knock echoes—not just through the house, but through the street itself, rolling out like a pebble tossed onto a frozen lake, sending ripples of faint chimes down every lamppost.

The door unlatches of its own accord, swinging inward on silent hinges, and you step across the threshold into a foyer where the ceiling stretches impossibly high—so high you can glimpse drifting clouds tinted the color of ripe apricots. A staircase climbs in a gentle spiral, each step a glowing slab of glass that tings softly when your foot lands. Halfway up, you notice miniature sailboats gliding along a thin ribbon of water carved into the banister, their paper sails printed with microscopic constellations.

At the landing you meet the first resident: an elderly woman wearing a robe woven from autumn leaves. Her irises sparkle like glints of mica, and she greets you with the warmth of someone who has known you for lifetimes. “Welcome to the Constant Neighborhood,” she says, voice rustling like wind through tall grass. “Our homes exchange secrets at midnight, so you may wake tomorrow to find your walls humming lullabies they learned three streets over. Keep your ears open.”

She presses into your palm a seed the size of a tear. “Plant this in your pocket,” she advises, “and let it grow whenever you feel alone.” You slip it into your coat and continue, descending a hallway lined with picture frames that contain not photographs but gusts of wind captured in glass. When you pause before one, your hair lifts, buffeted by the breeze trapped inside.

Next you find a copper elevator; instead of buttons, there is a harp with silver strings. You run a finger across a single string tuned to the note of longing, and the elevator sighs downward. Doors open onto an underground greenhouse stretching out like an emerald cathedral. Bioluminescent vines dangle overhead, shedding turquoise motes that drift lazily, illuminating clusters of crystalline flowers that tinkle like small bells when they bloom.

Here, another neighbor introduces himself—an androgynous figure wearing a waistcoat embroidered with phases of the moon. He offers you a mug steaming with lilac-scented tea. “It’s distilled from light that never quite reached the ground,” he says. The first sip tastes like a memory of laughter you haven’t encountered yet, and you feel your isolation dissolve into the soil at your feet.

Together you wander deeper until you reach a circular pool. Its surface holds still as a mirror, but instead of reflecting your face, it shows scenes of every conversation you have yet to have in this community: sunlit breakfasts on stoops, impromptu concerts beneath glowing streetlamps, silent shared moments watching thunderstorms bloom over distant hills. The images flicker, inviting, alive.

You recognize then that the neighborhood is a living organism, inhaling your uncertainty and exhaling invitations. Every brick, every window pane, every faint echo is a heartbeat urging you toward connection.

Feeling buoyant, you remove the tiny seed from your pocket and drop it onto the glassy water. It dissolves like sugar, and from the ripples rises a sapling of translucent petals and silver bark. It expands rapidly, branches unfurling in a slow spiral until it forms a luminous archway. Through this doorway you glimpse the cobblestone street outside—now awash in soft lanternlight—and the silhouettes of neighbors gathering, waiting, arms raised in greeting.

You step through the arch. The air smells of fresh rain and cinnamon. Above, the sky pirouettes from violet to indigo, and a solitary comet streaks overhead, trailing notes like a distant violin. As you cross the street, your footsteps leave brief reflections of constellations on the stones, and the stranger-neighbors begin to sing your name in a melody you do not yet know but instantly recognize.

In that moment, the dream tilts, as though the entire world is a snow globe being gently turned, and you realize that isolation has been replaced by possibility—an unfolding map of encounters, friendships, and shared wonders. You breathe in, tasting starlight and tea leaves, and the comet’s fading tail whispers a final promise:

“You are home now, dreamer—go on, knock again.”
