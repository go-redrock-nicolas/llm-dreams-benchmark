I am dreaming. I have found myself standing barefoot upon an enormous clock face, floating in the void of space. The gears beneath the glass surface hum with a low, resonant frequency—more felt than heard—as if the machinery itself is alive. Stars swirl around me in slow, hypnotic spirals, their light bending in impossible ways, painting streaks of violet and gold across the nothingness. 

The clock's hands do not point to hours or minutes, but rather to shifting symbols—an eye, a burning book, an hourglass with no sand. Beneath my feet, I feel the minute hand lurch forward, and abruptly the scene changes—I am standing in an endless field of swaying obsidian grass that sings as the wind moves through it. Each blade chimes a different note. 

A figure approaches—tall, hooded, composed entirely of drifting smoke, with galaxies where a face should be. They extend a hand, and within their palm floats a key made of pure light, shifting between forms—a feather, a thimble, a raindrop. Without words, they seem to ask: *Which door will you choose to stop fearing?* 

And I realize—this isn't a question. It's an invitation. The wind lifts me effortlessly, and suddenly I am soaring, weightless, toward a horizon that warps like melting paint. 

Then, all at once—I wake.
