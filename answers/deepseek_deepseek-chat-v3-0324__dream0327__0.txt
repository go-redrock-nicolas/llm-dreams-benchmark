I am dreaming. The air around me shimmers like liquid silver, and the ground beneath my feet is not solid but a shifting mosaic of memories—fragments of conversations, half-remembered touches, laughter that lingers like the scent of rain on warm pavement.  

A figure stands before me, familiar yet indistinct, their edges blurred as if seen through a rain-streaked window. It’s *them*—the person whose presence in my life has always been a constellation of contradictions: warmth and distance, closeness and mystery. But now, as I step closer, the distortions begin to unravel.  

The air hums with revelation. I see now how my own fears painted shadows where there were only nuances, how my expectations built walls where there were meant to be bridges. The assumptions I carried—heavy as stones in my pockets—were not truths, but reflections of my own unspoken doubts.  

A mirror materializes between us, its surface rippling like water. In it, our reflections are not separate but intertwined, like roots beneath the earth, each nourishing the other in ways I had refused to see. The realization is a slow sunrise, golden and inevitable: *I misunderstood. We both did.*  

The dream softens, the edges of the world glowing with a forgiving light. Words unspoken in waking life now float between us, weightless and luminous. A hand reaches out—theirs or mine, I can’t tell—and in that touch, there is no past or future, only the quiet, pulsing truth of *now*.  

And then, just as the dream begins to dissolve like mist at dawn, I hear a whisper—not with my ears, but with something deeper:  
*"See me as I am. See yourself as you are. That is where we meet."*  

I wake, not with a start, but with a slow, dawning warmth, as if the dream has left embers glowing softly in my chest.
