I am dreaming. You’re walking down the streets of a city between two people that are laughing and talking about their week, pointing out all the things they got done. It feels like you and your friends are anything but strangers. As you converse, you notice your words are jagged and strange, almost like your mind is moving too fast for your mouth to keep up. You look at your hands as you talk, but they seem translucent, as if through a mist. Mindful of this moment, you try to picture yourself.

No. Maybe you won’t.

You look at the people you’re with, trying to lock onto something concrete—but their faces lose focus as you adjust your eyes. People who were once familiar strangers are now becoming strangers to you. As if the moment has frozen, you turn your head to the side to notice a cityscape that looks like a painting where the colors drip from black and blue buildings into a darkened sky.

You start to walk a bit faster, trying to push your mind into something more grounded. The buildings turn into a forest, and you realize shortly after that you’ve been separated from your friends. You call out for them, but as you cup your hands over your mouth, you hear a loud, screeching eagle cry overhead. The forest shrinks away, as if the city has been swallowed up. 

You think of home. Dizziness sets in, your thoughts try to anchor, and you feel your body moving without the sense to stand up. 

And then, you’re awake.
