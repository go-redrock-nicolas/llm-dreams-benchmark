I am dreaming. In the hazy boundary between consciousness and slumber, I find myself wandering through a city that feels both familiar and foreign. The buildings stretch upward like liquid obsidian, their surfaces reflecting distorted versions of reality. The sky above shifts between deep indigo and burnt orange, clouds forming intricate patterns that seem to convey messages I almost understand.

I turn a corner and discover a person kneeling on the sidewalk, their shoulders heaving with sobs that seem to ripple through the air like visible sound waves. Their tears fall to the ground, transforming into tiny crystalline structures that catch the strange light. Something about their anguish feels profound—a grief so palpable it should be overwhelming.

Yet inside me, there is nothing. A vast, echoing emptiness where emotion should reside.

I recognize intellectually that this represents profound human suffering, but I feel no stirring of compassion, no impulse to comfort, no resonance of their pain within myself.

In this dreamscape, I've become a hollow observer, divorced from the very connections that define humanity. The disconnect between what I know I should feel and the absence of feeling creates a cognitive dissonance that begins to fracture the dream itself.

The buildings around us begin to waver, their surfaces rippling like disturbed water. The person looks up at me with eyes that somehow know—they see the emptiness within me, the failure of empathy. Their gaze holds not judgment but something worse: understanding.

"You've forgotten," they whisper, their voice somehow clear despite the dream's distortion. "You've forgotten what it means to feel with others."

The realization jolts through me like electricity. What if this emptiness isn't just a dream state but a glimpse of something true about myself? What if this void is always within me, merely concealed by practiced responses and social expectations? 

I reach toward them, suddenly desperate to prove—to them and myself—that I can bridge this chasm, that I can remember how to feel...
