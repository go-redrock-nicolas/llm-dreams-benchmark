I am dreaming. As I awaken in this strange new world, I am surrounded by a civilization that defies all logic and reason. 

Gravity, as I know it, no longer applies - people and objects float effortlessly through the air, their movements choreographed by an invisible force. Trees grow with their roots in the sky and their leaves anchored deep in the earth. Water flows upwards, forming towering fountains that seem to defy physics.

The inhabitants of this realm are equally perplexing. They speak a language that is both familiar and foreign, with words that sound like the whispers of the wind. They wear clothes that change color and texture before my very eyes, shifting and morphing to reflect their moods and emotions.
