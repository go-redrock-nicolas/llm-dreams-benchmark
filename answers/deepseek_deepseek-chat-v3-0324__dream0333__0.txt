I am dreaming.   

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and distant lightning, the kind that lingers just before a storm breaks. I stand at the edge of a vast, glassy lake, its surface so still it reflects the bruised purple sky like a polished mirror. Across the water, a figure moves—a silhouette I recognize, though their face is blurred, as if seen through frosted glass.  

They are walking toward a bridge, one made of frayed rope and splintered wood, swaying gently over the abyss of the lake’s depths. I know—somehow, in the way dreams grant knowledge without explanation—that the bridge will not hold. That beneath the water, something waits, patient and hungry.  

My mouth opens to call out, but the wind steals my voice, carrying it away in a whisper. Should I run to them? Would they even hear me? The figure steps onto the bridge, their footfall causing the first ominous creak.  

A choice splits the dream like lightning: do I shatter the illusion, risk the chaos of altering fate? Or do I watch, helpless, as the inevitable unfolds?  

The moment stretches, infinite. Then—I move.
