I am dreaming. In a rare, dreamless sleep, I lay curled beneath a quilt in a small motel room at the edge of a bustling, sun-soaked town. The air was hazy with the smoky scent of distant cookfires and honeysuckle, and the fan above my bed turned lazily, stirring the warm dusk. Beyond the thin walls, the familiar drone of cicadas was interrupted by the staccato rhythm of heels on pavement and the drone of a departing truck. 

A few hours before, I’d been crouched on the hard shoulder of the highway in the blistering sun, a few belongings scattered around me after the bus I’d boarded had broken down. Stranded in an unfamiliar place, I’d felt the creeping anxiety build. This was supposed to be a fresh start—one more leap toward a new beginning after losing nearly everything. 

And then, a woman, maybe in her early thirties, pulled over in a dusty Ford. Her name was Rose, she said, extending a slender hand. Dark hair spilled from beneath her baseball cap, and her eyes were kind. She offered me a ride to the nearest town, and as we drove, the windows down and the radio crooning faintly, I couldn’t shake the sensation of being watched. 

By the time we reached the motel, I knew her story. She was a teacher, heading home after a school trip. She’d come to this crossroads in her own life—staying in a sleepy town where she felt trapped, longing for a life unlived. She’d shared her dreams with me: a cottage by the sea, painting, solitude. 

As I drifted off in the motel bed, my thoughts tangled with gratitude and uncertainty. Would this journey ever truly end? Would I ever belong somewhere? 

When I woke, I wasn’t in the motel anymore. 

I stood at the edge of a vast canyon, beneath a swirling kaleidoscope of stars that seemed to pulse with energy. Below me, a river wound lazily through the canyon floor, reflecting the trembling light of a full moon. The air was crisp, cool, and alive with a thousand tiny sounds—crickets, the gurgle of the river, the whisper of wind through ancient trees. 

A pale figure stood beside me. I recognized the dark hair, the calm eyes. Rose. 

“You’re here,” I murmured. 

She smiled faintly, turning toward the river. “We all are, at some point.” 

The dream shifted. Suddenly, I was no longer standing at the canyon’s edge; I was walking along the river, barefoot, the cool water lapping at my ankles. Each step felt heavier, as if the earth itself was pulling me downward. I glanced at Rose, who walked steadily ahead, leaving no footprints. 

“Where are we going?” 

She didn’t answer, but her serenity was contagious. For the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel the need to ask questions. I was okay, here in this dream, with this woman I barely knew yet somehow trusted. 

We reached a small clearing bathed in moonlight, a little meadow dotted with wildflowers. In its center stood a lone willow tree, its branches swaying gently in an invisible breeze. Beneath it, something glimmered—a pool of water so clear it seemed to reflect not only the sky but the deepest parts of myself. 

Before I could speak, Rose placed a hand on my shoulder. “You’re almost there,” she said softly. 

The dream fractured, and I jolted awake, back in the motel room, my heart racing. For a moment, I could still feel the cool river water, hear the whisper of the willow branches, the words that lingered like a ghost in the room. 

Almost there. 

It wasn’t until morning, as I packed my bag and stepped outside into the early light, that I understood. Rose was gone, but the road stretched ahead, winding and endless. I wasn’t lost anymore.
