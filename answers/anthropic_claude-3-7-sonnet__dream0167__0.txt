I am dreaming. I'm standing on a weathered stone platform suspended between two massive cliff faces, the endless sky beneath my feet a dizzying blue abyss dotted with slow-moving clouds. The wind carries the scent of ash and mountain herbs. On either side of this natural bridge, opposing delegations glare at each other with generations of hatred burning in their eyes.

To my left stand the Ashtari, adorned in crimson fabrics and bronze armor that catches the sunlight. Their skin bears elaborate scarifications documenting their ancestors' deaths. To my right, the Vordani representatives wait with their characteristic blue-black hair elaborately braided, their pale skin painted with symbols in pigments derived from sacred cave minerals. Both groups' hands rest nervously on ceremonial weapons.

My carefully crafted proposals—parchments filled with boundary compromises, shared resource agreements, and justice tribunals—lie torn at my feet, shredded by ceremonial daggers from both sides. The elders have spat on my words. Centuries of blood feuds cannot be washed away with diplomatic language.

A peculiar heaviness fills the air as both delegations begin simultaneously backing away from the center platform where I remain. Their expressions shift from anger to something more primitive—fear. The stone beneath me rumbles, and ancient symbols carved into the bridge begin to glow with amber light.

I realize with sudden clarity that this bridge isn't merely a meeting place—it's an ancient entity, dormant for millennia, awakened by the intensity of emotion converging here. The dreams of generations who died in this conflict have coalesced into something sentient.

As the representatives retreat in terror, ghostly figures materialize—thousands of spectral forms representing every soul lost in their endless war. They don't speak, but their collective consciousness flows into my mind: these warring peoples were once one tribe, separated by a cataclysm and twisted by time into enemies. Their shared ancestry pulses through my consciousness like a forgotten heartbeat.

Possessed by understanding beyond my own knowledge, my hands begin weaving intricate patterns in the air, drawing together threads of light from the spirits around me. I am no longer just a negotiator but a conduit for reconciliation that transcends political solutions, tapping into the collective memory of a people who've forgotten they are kin...
