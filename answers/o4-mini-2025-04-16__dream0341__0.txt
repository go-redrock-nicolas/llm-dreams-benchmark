I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You feel an overwhelming sense of responsibility for someone else’s wellbeing during a crisis. Carrying this emotional burden, you step forward into a landscape that shifts beneath your feet—an obsidian plain studded with glowing, cobalt-hued stones that pulse like anxious hearts. The sky overhead roils with violet clouds, each one crackling with silver lightning. Somewhere beyond the storm’s rumble, a voice calls out, trembling.

Your chest tightens as you follow that voice, weaving between jagged pillars of salt that drip with molten gold. With each step, the stones underfoot throb in time with your heartbeat, as if the world itself acknowledges the weight you bear. You imagine the person you’ve vowed to protect—a fragile presence wrapped in a cloak of ash—waiting for you at the edge of this strange realm.

Suddenly, the ground quakes. Cracks open up at your ankles, and from them seep a luminous mist that smells of rain and distant memories. You reach out and see your own hand reflected in the haze, pale and determined. In the distance, a colossal, skeletal tree bursts into flame—its branches writhe like molten glass—illuminating a narrow bridge of glass shards suspended over a bottomless chasm.

Heart pounding, you scramble across the bridge, each shard singing under your weight. The voice grows louder now, a soft, pleading murmur. You steady yourself on a shard tipped with green fire, and peer down into the chasm. Darkness stares back, alive with tiny flickers—like the eyes of creatures you cannot name. A wave of doubt sweeps through you: what if you fail?

Before you can falter, a gentle warmth blossoms in your chest. It’s as if someone’s hand has slipped into yours—steadying, resolute. You realize it’s your own courage, given form. With renewed determination, you cradle that fire-lit shard and step off the glass bridge. Instantly, the chasm’s darkness recoils, and the green flame pulses brighter, guiding you toward a distant archway carved from moonlight.

Beyond the archway, the world softens into rolling meadows of silver grass. There, crouched beneath a tree made of crystal tears, is the person you protect. Their eyes shine with relief as you approach. They lean on you, fragile but alive. In that hush of silver blades rustling around you, the storm overhead quiets, and though the burden still rests on your shoulders, you feel it lighten. The glowing stones at your feet seem to hum a lullaby, reassuring you that in this dream—and perhaps beyond—it’s your steadfast heart that will carry you both safely home.
