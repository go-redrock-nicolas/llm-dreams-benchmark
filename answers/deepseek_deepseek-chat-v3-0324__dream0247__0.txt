I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Unwoven Tapestry**  

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the distant thrum of a forgotten song. You stand in a dimly lit hallway lined with towering bookshelves—each tome bound in worn leather, spines etched with gilded names you don’t recognize, yet they feel… familiar. A whisper slithers between the shelves: *"You were never told the whole story."*  

Your fingers graze a book, and the moment you pull it free, the room shudders. The walls dissolve like sand, and suddenly you’re standing in the center of a sprawling, fragmented memory—a scene illuminated by flickering candlelight.  

A long table stretches before you. Figures sit in silence, their faces obscured by shifting shadows. At the head of the table, a woman who looks like your mother—but softer, wearier—holds a bundle wrapped in cloth. She speaks to someone unseen: *"She can’t know. Not yet."* The bundle stirs. A tiny hand emerges. *Your* hand.  

A mirror materializes beside you. Your reflection wavers, then fractures into countless versions of yourself—each dressed differently, speaking languages you’ve never learned, laughing in voices you don’t recognize as your own. One reflection steps forward, eyes like dark pools. *"They thought they were protecting you,"* she murmurs. *"But the past has claws."*  

The floor drops away. You fall through layers of time—glimpses of strangers exchanging hushed words in foreign tongues, a burning letter, a gravestone with your name but the wrong date. And then, silence.  

You wake in a room you’ve never seen, yet know intimately. A chest sits at the foot of a bed, unlocked. Inside: a stack of photographs with faces scratched out. A pressed flower. A key with no lock.  

The dream doesn’t end—it dissolves, like ink in water, leaving only the scent of old paper and the weight of something unsaid lodged in your chest.  

You breathe. The revelation coils around you, heavy but not crushing. There’s unsettling power in not knowing—and greater power in the choice of what to do next.  

The candle flickers. The dream waits.
