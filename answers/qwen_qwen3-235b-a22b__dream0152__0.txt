I am dreaming. ...

The air around me shimmers with a strange, iridescent haze, as though reality itself is being filtered through a prism of time. I stand—though I am not sure where—on a platform stitched from woven constellations, suspended in a sky that breathes. Above me hang inverted oceans, folding endlessly into themselves, and below glide celestial creatures made of language and forgotten thoughts. Here, time does not progress; it blooms.

The Dream knows I am tired of spectacle and seeks to engage me in something greater… something *moral*.

I am not merely wandering consciousness here; I am judge. Adjudicator. Arbiter of a dispute so conceptually dense it can’t yet be spoken aloud.

The two sides, radiant and terrible in their convictions, have already spoken. A quorum of listening stars bore witness. I must weigh what was said.

One faction—called the Etherians—pleaded for the survival of memory above all else. They believe that a civilization must never lose its recollections, not even the darkest of them, because to forget is to lose one’s essence. Each person carries within them a *recording root*—a network through which ancestors speak, cry, remember. They showed me what happens when the root decays: the soul degenerates into hollow compulsion, mechanically imitating life with no past to justify it.

The other side—the Novamancers—argued for the reverence of forgetting. They claimed that memory is a cage. They summoned images of young minds burning under the weight of inherited regrets, destinies crumbled under the millstone of ancient wounds. One child, eyes full of ancestral wars, cried blood-tears until a whisper-network of air spirits scrubbed identity clean and let it bloom anew.

Both so *right.* Both so *awfully right.* And both so capable of irreversible harm.

The Etherians would preserve the past so perfectly that no soul could awaken unburdened. The Novamancers would let identity evaporate like dew so no one would carry guilt that was never theirs. The implications for justice, for liberty, for the basic integrity of the self—all hinges on my decision.

And then, something *shifts*.

As if the dream itself has demanded a climax. I am no longer listening. I am *transforming*. My spine stretches into a great ladder of bone-light tiles descending into infinity. Tons of unanswered questions push upward through my ribs. My voice, distant and alien, rises from my brow:

> "You have not come to me for a verdict," it says. "You have come for a *story*. I will answer not in edict, but in meaning."

So I begin to dream aloud.

I narrate a prayer.

I describe a world where memory is not preserved nor erased, but *woven*. Where ancestral voices grow into songs, but the song can be re-composed. Each soul enters the Loom—not as a blank slate nor a bound ledger—but as a *needle*. We are what we memorialize, yes, but also what we imagine for the future. We are memory *and* movement. The idea that you must *carry or discard* is false; we *weave* both.

As I speak, the quorum of stars explodes into melody. The celestial creatures below burst into shimmering skinless alphabets. I feel the Dream convulsing with satisfaction.

The case is not *closed*—this is dreaming, so certainty is minimal—but somehow, behind my eyelids, I know the horizon has shifted.

And as I drift upward through the breathing sky, the ether settles. 

The colors turn towards dawn. The trial dissolves. The witness-stars wink out one by one.  

I awaken not with answers, but emboldened by *not knowing*, and in that, I feel—truly—the first thrilling breath of wisdom.
