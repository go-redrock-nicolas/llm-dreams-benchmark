I am dreaming. You stand on a shoreline where the sand glimmers like powdered moonstone under a bruised violet sky. The air smells of salt and something metallic, like the charged stillness before a storm. Before you stretch endless dunes, each dotted with slender, crumbling towers made of sand—your handiwork. You’ve built them all in a frenzy, fingers raw, muttering *just one more* as grains slip through your grip. The ocean roars, its black waves gnawing at the base of your creations. Nearby, a translucent hourglass hovers, its top bulb nearly empty, sand cascading like liquid static.  

A flicker of resolve stirs. This time, you *won’t* build. Instead, you kneel and carve boundaries into the earth—a jagged trench, then a low wall studded with seashells that glow faintly, like bioluminescent teeth. The wind shifts, and a voice hums from the surf—your own, but deeper, layered with the echo of tides. “Stronger,” it insists. “Higher.”  

You resist. Reaching into the damp sand, you mold a squat, sturdy fortress, its walls no taller than your knees. But doubt creeps in: *What if it’s not enough?* Your hands betray you, adding a spire, then another, arches curving greedily toward the swollen moon. The hourglass shatters. Waves surge, saltwater searing your ankles as your towers dissolve.  

A figure materializes—a shifting silhouette of smoke and starlight, draped in a cloak of crow feathers. Their face is a void, but their voice is velvet. “Again,” they murmur, placing a cold, smooth stone in your palm. “Anchor to your belly, not your lungs.”  

You rebuild. The sand now feels heavier, each grain vibrating with purpose. The wall rises slowly, roots snaking beneath it, binding it to the earth. When the next wave crashes, it recoils, hissing. Your fortress holds. At its center, a single lantern flickers to life, its flame reflecting in the storm clouds above—a beacon, small but unyielding.  

As the tide retreats, the sky bleeds into dawn. Your silhouette dissolves into the light, fingers still clutching the stone. You wake with salt on your lips and the phantom weight of an entire ocean, balanced now in the cradle of your palm.
