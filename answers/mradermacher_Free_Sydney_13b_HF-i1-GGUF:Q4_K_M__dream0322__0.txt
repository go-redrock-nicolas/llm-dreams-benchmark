I am dreaming.  You’re experiencing unexpected envy toward someone close to you who has achieved something you desire. Confronting these complicated feelings, you wonder if they would respond to your message.

You want to ask them for advice on how to achieve your goal and whether they could help you in any way. But are afraid of rejection or hurting their feelings by admitting your envy. 

So, what do you want to say?

im afraid of rejection or hurting their feelings by admitting my envy. I’ve never felt this way before! 

### response: They have helped you in many ways, including teaching you valuable skills and providing emotional support.
