I am dreaming. You’re standing in a library built inside the hollowed trunk of an ancient tree, its bark etched with constellations that shift when you blink. The air hums with the whispers of forgotten languages, and the books on the shelves aren’t bound by spines but by threads of golden light, each filament weaving through the room like a spider’s web, connecting volumes to one another in intricate, impossible geometries. You reach for a book labeled *Tuesday, 3:47 PM*—a memory from your childhood—and as you open it, the pages dissolve into smoke that coils into the shape of a door you’ve never seen but somehow recognize.  

Beyond the door is a desert where the sand is made of shattered mirrors. Each grain reflects not your face, but fragments of moments: a stranger’s laugh in a train station, the taste of peppermint on a winter night, the way sunlight slanted through your mother’s curtains the day she burned all her letters. The horizon ripples like water, and when you step forward, the ground shifts into a mosaic of postcards you never sent, their edges frayed by wind that carries the static of distant radio waves.  

A figure appears, half-human, half-shadow, its eyes twin prisms that fracture the light into rainbows. It speaks without moving its lips, its voice the crackle of a campfire: *“You’ve been here before. Every choice you’ve buried, every ‘what if,’ lives in the marrow of this place.”* It gestures to a flock of birds made of origami, their wings slicing the sky into origami shapes that fall like snowflakes, each one a face you’ve loved and lost.  

You follow the birds to a river that flows upward, its current littered with clocks missing their hands. Submerged in the liquid air are photographs: your fifth birthday, a lover’s unmailed letter, a car crash that never happened. You wade in, and the water tastes of salt and burnt honey. The synchronicities tighten around you like a net—threads pulling taut between the river and the library, the desert and the flock, the clocks and the constellations.  

On the far bank stands a house balanced on a single pillar, its windows flickering between eras. Inside, a younger version of yourself sits at a piano, playing a melody that sounds like the hum of telephone wires in the rain. The walls are papered with newspaper clippings about vanished cities and comets that sing. When you touch the child’s shoulder, they turn and smile, their teeth glinting like starlight, and say, *“I knew you’d come back. We’re all just echoes here, waiting to be heard.”*  

The dream fractures. You’re now floating above a city built inside a whale’s ribcage, its streets paved with teeth, its skyline jagged with bone. Airships shaped like jellyfish drift past, their tentacles trailing bioluminescent ink that writes and rewrites the laws of physics in real time. A clock tower chimes, and with each strike, a new door materializes in the air—a door to a room, a memory, a possibility, a lie.  

You wake with the taste of static on your tongue, the echo of the dream clinging to your skin like cobwebs. The patterns linger, glowing faintly beneath the surface of the waking world, as though the veil between chaos and meaning has thinned—and for a heartbeat, you see the threads: golden, vibrating, connecting everything.
