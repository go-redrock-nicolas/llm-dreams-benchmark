I am dreaming. I float in a city at dawn where buildings breathe like sleeping giants. The concrete and glass inhale and exhale imperceptibly, their windows blinking like drowsy eyes. I notice my reflection in a storefront—but it's not quite me. This reflection is unburdened, wearing fewer layers both literally and metaphorically.

The reflection beckons, and suddenly I'm walking through walls that feel like cool mist. Each wall I pass through strips away something—first my watch, then my phone, then my wallet. With each loss comes not panic but profound relief, weights I never realized I carried.

The city begins to transform. Streets curl upward like pages in a book. I follow a meandering path that spirals toward a massive ancient tree growing impossibly at the city's center. Its roots crack through pavement, creating natural staircases that people traverse with bare feet.

As I climb these living stairs, scattered objects from my life materialize on the roots—childhood toys, forgotten books, dusty ambitions. Each one glows briefly as I pass, then dissolves into pollen that floats skyward.

At the tree's crown, I discover a simple wooden platform with nothing but a small table holding a cup of tea and a single book. The horizon reveals not urban sprawl but endless forest, as if the city was merely a temporary intrusion on nature's permanence.

The tea tastes of memories I haven't yet made. The book, when opened, shows only one sentence on the first page: "Begin again, but carry less."

I wake with tears on my face, though I'm smiling.
