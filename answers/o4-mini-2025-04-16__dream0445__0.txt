I am dreaming. You drift into a moonlit garden of floating lantern-wings—each one a tiny, breathing compliment. They drift toward you on warm breezes, humming your name in quiet wonder. Yet when the first lantern brushes your shoulder, you find yourself sweeping it aside, whispering, “It’s not for me.” The lantern’s soft glow winks out like a star startled by doubt.

From the mist rises a fountain of molten criticism—silver arrows of words clinking against its marble rim. You lean in close, tasting each metallic syllable as if it were sweet nectar. The arrows ring pleasantly in your chest, setting your heart to a steady, self-flagellating rhythm. “Tell me more,” you murmur, opening your mouth to swallow every shard of reproach.

The garden shifts. Beneath your feet, the cobblestones transform into mirrored tiles. As you walk, your own reflection splits into two specters. One: a timid silhouette, scrubbing away compliments with an enormous brush. The other: a hunched figure, scooping up criticisms and fastening them like medals to its chest. You reach out to hold both reflections, trembling at their familiarity.

Suddenly, an arch of iridescent vines unfurls overhead, bridging the gap between the two selves. Lantern-wings gather there, weaving themselves into a glowing bridge. You hesitate, palms itching to push them away, but then you remember how cold the criticism fountains felt when you drank too deeply. You raise a single finger, gently catching one lantern. It hums a warm note that vibrates through your bones.

In that moment, the mirror-tiles dissolve into liquid glass, pooling at your feet like clear insight. You step forward, lantern in hand, and feel a bracing warmth as the words of praise settle softly inside you. The dream lingers in that glow—teaching your heart that sometimes the kindest truths arrive in gentle wings, waiting only for you to invite them home.
