I am dreaming. Working through this uncomfortable emotion, you rise onto your feet in the heart of a forest made of light. The trunks around you glow in soft pulses—gold one moment, rose the next—each beat echoing the thrum of your own heart. You realize the jealous knot inside you is alive, a slimy black caterpillar inching along your spine, whispering doubts about your worth.  

You step forward, and the forest floor responds: phosphorescent ferns unfurl at your feet, brushing your ankles with dew that smells of honey and rain. Each step dissolves another swell of jealousy, and the caterpillar’s grip slackens. A path of translucent stones floats ahead, each one bearing an image of the person whose success stoked your envy—smiling faces, triumphant gestures, trophies held aloft. You pause at the first stone and find the scene refracted, not as a threat but as art: a mosaic of light and color that would not exist without its shadows.  

Gathering courage, you place a foot on that first stone. It hums under your weight, vibrating through your bones. The caterpillar writhes, flicking its tail, but the next step calls to you. On each successive stone, the images shift—moments of struggle, uncertainty, tears shed in private. You see the raw edges behind their polished victory. You realize this person’s journey is as jagged and humble as your own. With every leap from stone to stone, your jealousy-lightens and transmutes into empathy.  

Suddenly the stones vanish, and you find yourself on the crest of a hill carved from moonlight. An enormous mirror looms at its peak, framed by twisting vines of cobalt-blue ivy. Bracing yourself, you approach and stare into the glass. Your reflection shimmers; around you, the ivy pulses in time with the caterpillar’s final wriggling protests.  

Taking a deep breath scented of starlight, you lean forward and press your palm against the cool surface. In that instant, the mirror liquefies, flooding in and washing over you like a warm tide. You are no longer separate from your reflection—you are the tide, the mirror, the catalyzing force that turns envy into motivation. The black caterpillar dissolves into droplets of pearl-white light that drift upward and scatter across the night sky as new stars.  

Above you, constellations realign themselves into a single, shining glyph that spells out your name, not as a boast but as a promise of ongoing growth. You feel an exhilarating calm: the recognition that someone else’s successes are not walls closing in on you but beacons guiding your own path.  

As dawn’s first lavender tendrils brush the horizon, the dream begins to fade. You carry away the memory of that phosphorescent forest, the resonant stones, and the mirror’s transformation. You wake with your chest still humming—jealousy transmuted, curiosity ignited, ready to shape your own mosaic of triumph and shadow.
