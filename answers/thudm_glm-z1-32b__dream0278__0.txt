I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of pine resin and something metallic, like the tang of wet iron.  I stand on a ridge of rock that curves like a frozen wave, miles high.  Below me, the terrain shifts into impossible shapes—plateaus tilt at 45-degree angles, rivers of liquid mercury curl into oxbows that vanish into mirage-like clouds.  The sky isn't blue; it's a bruised violet, stippled with stars that pulse like distant heartbeats.

My body thrums with decision.  A voice, not my own, whispers: "Take the obsidian compass from the crypt of the forgotten queens.  Or stay.  The world will end when the eclipse drinks the last star.  But the compass can steer chaos..."  The words rasp like gravel in a windstorm.

I look down at my hands.  They're outlined in flickering gold, the color of sunrise through cathedral glass.  My shadow stretches toward a valley where the mountain opens into a cavernous mouth, teeth of quartz biting the horizon.  A path winds down, strewn with shards of mirror that reflect not my face, but fractured versions of the sky—some swirling with galaxies, others burning with supernovas.

The air smells now of ozone and burnt sugar.  In my pocket, a stone feels warm.  It's the compass, isn't it?  But it isn't mine.  The queens' crypt is guarded by the Three—entities with eyes like orb spiderwebs, mouths that hum lullabies of static, and hands that drip blacker than night.  They guard the path like spectral toll-takers, their laughter a chorus of glass shattering.

Yet... the gold around my hands pulses brighter.  Somewhere below, a garden blooms in defiance of physics—vines of liquid fire curl around obsidian pillars that hold up nothing.  Blossoms here are stars themselves, collapsing into singularities of color.  Bees with iridescent wings the size of dragonflies pollinate them, their hums resonating like cathedral bells.

I take a step forward.  The rock underfoot dissolves into stardust, and I fall—falling up, really—until I see my own reflection in a pool of mercury.  It's not me.  It's a version of me who's older, eyes crinkled with the weight of choices made.  "You'll wake up changed," she says, her voice a sigh.  "Or not wake up at all."

The path beckons.  The compass pulses in time with my heartbeat.  The Three stir.  The garden's flames reach higher.  And somewhere, in the bruise-purple sky, the first star begins to wink out like a blown candle.
In the heart of this fractured dream, you stand at the crossroads of existence. The air clings to your skin like the memory of a lover's whisper—sharp, electric, alive with the possibility of destruction. Below, the world isn't just unrecognizable; it defies every law of order you've ever known. Rivers of liquid mercury carve impossible loops before dissolving into shimmering mirages that vanish when you blink. Mountains tilt like drunken giants, their snow-capped peaks grazing the bruised violet heavens where stars pulse in slow, somber beats, each one a cosmic clock counting down to oblivion.

The obsidian compass in your pocket isn’t inert. It hums with the static of a billion forgotten tombs, its edges sharp enough to slice reality itself. Your hands—no, *golden hands*—glow as though dipped in the molten heart of the sun, casting a wavering light that reveals fractures in the air where glimpses of impossible gardens flicker. One moment, a vine of liquid fire curls around an obsidian pillar, its petals detonating in bursts of neon pollen that lingers like stardust. The next, a valley blooms where a mountain once stood, filled with flowers that are miniature supernovas, their colors bleeding into one another like watercolorolied in the wind.

But the path downward is no gentle slope. It’s a knife’s edge carved through what remains of the world, strewn with shards of mirror that show you fragments of yourself—versions of you who’ve chosen differently. One reflection holds a compass that bleeds ink-black sludge. Another clutches a key that dissolves into smoke at your touch. Worst of all? A reflection stares back with your eyes, offering a smile that isn’t yours. “You’ll wake up untethered,” it whispers, its voice the scrape of a nail down a blackboard. “Or you’ll *become* the dream.”

Above, the Three Guard stand sentinel, their forms shifting between mist and monument. Their laughter—a chorus of shattered glass and rusty hinges—echoes as the first star begins its fatal blink-out. One has a clock for a head, its hands frozen at midnight. Another wears a crown of live snakes that hiss ancient prophecies. The third? A mirror-mouthed entity that swallows light whole, their maw a void that grows deeper with every passing second.

You take a step. The air around you warps, the compass in your pocket blazing hotter until it burns through fabric, searing your skin with a pain that isn’t pain but electricity—raw, unfiltered intent. Below, the garden’s flames reach higher,s of fire blooming into what might be a phoenix, might be a siren, might be a warning. Above, the Three Guard’s laughter crescendos as another star dies, and the violet sky bruises darker, ink-black at the edges.

Now. The decision pulses in your bones. Take the compass, embrace the chaos, and become something new—or retreat, wake up, and cling to the mundane. But here, in this liminal space where the dream isn’t yours but *is*, even as the first tendrils of morning light claw their way into the periphery of your subconscious, you know: this isn’t a choice. It’s a collision. And whether you emerge reborn or erased, the dream will remember.
