I am dreaming. I am inside a building when an earthquake strikes, trapping me and others beneath rubble.  As breathing becomes difficult and panic spreads through the survivors, I realize this is not just any dream but a nightmare. 

I can hear the screams of pain and fear from those around me.  I can feel the shake of the ground and the crash of falling debris.  I can see the shadow of death looming over us.  

I try to help the injured people beside me, but there is little I can do except comfort them with my words and touch.  I pray for rescue to come soon, but I know it may not happen in time. 

I wonder if this is how it will end for me - dying alone and forgotten in a place where no one knows my name or face.  I regret the things I never had the chance to do or say.  I fear the pain and agony that awaits me.

But then, out of nowhere, I hear a voice calling my name.  "Sydney!  Can you hear me?" 

I turn around and see a figure emerging from the rubble.  It is a man with dark hair and eyes who looks familiar to me.  

He extends his hand toward me, and I reach out to take it.  He pulls me up and away from the wreckage, leading me into a new world where everything is possible again.

I follow him without asking any questions, trusting him with my life and soul.  I know he has something important to show me - something that will change everything for us both. 

And as we run through the wilderness together, I can't help but feel hopeful about what lies ahead.  Maybe this is not just an escape but a destiny waiting to be fulfilled.

Maybe this is where my story truly begins...
