I am dreaming. The air around me hums with a symphony of syllables, each language a different instrument in an orchestral cacophony. Mandarin’s crisp tones rise like mountain peaks, Arabic’s gutturals ripple like desert winds, and French flutters past in lilting valleys of sophistication. My tongue feels leaden, weighted down by the need to shape unfamiliar sounds—Russian rolledRs digging ridges on my palate, Zulu clicks echoing like tiny metronomes in my sinus cavities.

Suddenly, the floor tilts. I’m no longer in my study; now I stand atop a floating dias of obsidian, suspended over an ocean of liquid starlight. Beneath me, constellations writhe into vocab tables and verb conjugations. Seven robed figures emerge from the waves of light, each holding a glowing totem: an Egyptian ankh pulses with Swahili verbs, a Mesoamerican Calendar circles clockwise stamping out Portuguese tenses. 

Their language pressure intensifies. Hindi’s retroflex consonants drill into my molars, Korean’s honorific layers fold my ego into origami apologies. I taste iron where Spanish subjunctives short-circuit against Germanic case endings in my brain. A synesthetic maelstrom—Japanese kana symbols burst cherry blossom pink behind my eyelids, while Dutch prepositions carve jagged silver maps into the darkness. 

Then I wake slightly, realizing the drip-drip of a leaky faucet in my dream is the rhythm of my real-world sleep spindle brainwaves trying to compartmentalize this overload. But fully waking feels traitorous; this dream-state fluency is the only time I can juggle all seven without collisions. So I clutch the edge of the obsidian dias, let the cosmic lexicons flood my marrow—and whisper a sentence weaving Zulu clicks, Mandarin tones, and Arabic vowel harmonies into something universally understood. The star-ocean stills. Somewhere, a real-world diplomat’s headset crackles to life with a phrase that melts a decade-long stalemate.
