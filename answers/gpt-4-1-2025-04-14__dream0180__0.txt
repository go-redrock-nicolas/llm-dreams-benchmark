I am dreaming.

The world slips sideways and I awaken beneath a sky awash in saffron and violet, where a sun with three amber rings drifts lazily above a city spun from glass and woven silver. The air smells of sweet coriander and smoke. All around me, tall figures clothed in iridescent silks glide like dancers, their faces adorned with intricate patterns of sparkling dust. They speak not with words, but with an elegant symphony of gestures—slow, deliberate, full of veiled intention.

I am drawn into their world, welcomed by a procession of hands pressing delicately to heart and brow, bodies bowing at precise angles. Everything follows a rhythm just beneath perception, a choreography ancient and unknowable. I attend a gathering in a luminous hall where shadows shimmer and ripple across the mosaic floor. A feast unfolds, each delicacy unveiled by a synchronized breath, each toast accompanied by a fluttering cascade of silver ribbons.

Here, every interaction adheres to sacred etiquette: eye contact is avoided at all but scheduled moments, laughter must be hidden behind the left hand, and no one must accept a gift unless it is offered thrice. I try to play my part, mimicking the ritual bows and the flutter of silks, but my borrowed manners are brittle and strange.

Then, in an ordinary instant, I make a terrible misstep. A child offers me a blossom shaped like a crimson star, and, thinking only of kindness, I accept it too soon—before the second offering, before tradition breathes its blessing. The hall falls silent. A piercing hush descends, the very air holding its breath. Faces turn, eyes wide with horror and shimmering grief.

Suddenly, the petals in my palm unfurl, releasing a thousand tiny moths of azure and gold that swirl violently through the hall, scattering the diners and shattering bowls of honeyed glass. The elders rise, gather around me in a circle, and as I try to explain, their hands move in a flurry—a language more eloquent than words, weaving forgiveness and disappointment and caution into the air itself.

Yet they do not punish or expel me. Instead, a gentle old woman takes my hand, tracing patterns on my skin with her silvered finger, teaching me—gesture by gesture, breath by breath—the tender, intricate grammar of belonging, of respect, and of hope restored after transgression. 

And in that moment, deeply humbled, I begin to learn—here in this dream—that even the most elaborate and alien dances of the heart can be mastered, step by careful step, if only one dares to listen, and dares to stay.
