I am dreaming. As I drift into the realm of dreams, the walls around me start to warp and wobble, their once-sturdy forms now undulating like living tissue. With alarm, I notice cracks spiderwebbing across the ceiling, growing wider by the second. A heavy gurgle echoes from somewhere within, and I feel the floor beneath me sink with a sickening groan.

I spring into action, racing through rooms as they transform before my eyes. The kitchen's tiles ripple like water, while paint peels off in long, ghostly tendrils. A violent shudder throws me off balance, sending me stumbling as sections of the floor give way to gaping holes that swallow everyday objects in their abyssal depths.

With mounting panic, I realize my home is literally falling apart around me. The destruction isn't random - it's concentrated, spreading from room to room like a hungry virus. I spot a toolbox in a semi-intact corner and haul it out, determined to save what I can. My hands shake as I dig out supplies, mind reeling at the enormity of the task ahead.

Every hammer strike and slice of duct tape feels like a battle against entropy itself. The more I work, the more the very walls seem to mock my efforts, crumpling paper-thin and splitting apart at the seams. I hear furniture crashing downstairs, the walls creaking ominously overhead. The reality of being overwhelmed by a task beyond my skills and resources hits hard.
