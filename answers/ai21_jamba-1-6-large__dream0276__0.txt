I am dreaming. I am lying on a white sandy beach as the waves crash against the shore. The sun is setting, casting a warm orange glow across the sky. I feel a sense of peace and tranquility wash over me as I close my eyes and listen to the sound of the waves. 

As I lay there, I begin to feel small grains of sand beneath my fingertips. Each grain feels insignificant on its own, but as I move my hand through the sand, I begin to feel the collective weight of all the grains beneath me. 

Suddenly, I feel a sense of motivation wash over me. I realize that even small actions and rewards can add up to something significant over time. I open my eyes and sit up, feeling energized and ready to take on the world. 

I stand up and begin to walk along the shore, feeling the cool ocean water lap at my feet. The more I walk, the more I feel a sense of purpose and direction in my life. I know that every small step I take towards my goals will eventually lead to something great. 

As the sun sets lower in the sky, I turn back towards the beach and see a small fire burning. I walk over and sit down next to it, feeling the warmth of the flames on my skin. I reflect on the changes in my motivation patterns and realize that even the smallest rewards can be significant if I allow them to be. 

With this newfound perspective, I close my eyes and drift off into a peaceful sleep, feeling grateful for the change in my outlook on life.
