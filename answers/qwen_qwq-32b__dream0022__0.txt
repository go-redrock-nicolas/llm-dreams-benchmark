I am dreaming. In this dream, my two best friends, Maya and Liam, are locked in a heated argument. The air crackles with tension, swirling around them like static electricity. We’re standing in a place that’s part rainforest, part labyrinth—vines hang like whipmasters, leaves shimmering in hues of electric blue and molten gold. The ground underfoot is mossy and soft, but it pulses rhythmically, as if the earth itself is holding its breath. 

Maya’s voice is sharp, metallic, each syllable slicing through the humid air. “You *promised*, Liam!” She gestures wildly, and a nearby cluster of bioluminescent flowers dim slightly at her anger. Her palms are glowing faintly, a trick of the dream-world’s physics—or maybe her emotions manifesting. 

Liam’s face is a clenched fist. “Promises don’t mean shit when reality hits!” His words echo, bouncing off grotesquely large ferns that lean in like eavesdropping gargoyles. A strange, almost reptilian shadow flickers underneath him, coiling like an angry serpent. “You think I don’t care? Look at what happened to us because of it!” He points to the canopy above, where the sky is fractured—a mosaic of storm clouds and starless night, each piece pulling away from the other. 

They both turn to me, their eyes wide and frantic. I’m the mediator. The peacekeeper. The one who’s always been ‘safe’ in this triangle. But how do you fix something that’s not just broken, but shattering into thisOtherWorld where gravity’s a suggestion and logic is optional?

The moss beneath me quivers, and I feel the weight of their expectations—not a pressure, but a vibration in my ribcage, like a bee trapped inside. My own personal anxiety-meteor. 

I open my mouth, but no words come out. The air is too thick, the world too unstable. The landscape around us ripples, fractal patterns bubbling at the edges of my vision. A voice in my head whispers that if I fail here, the dream might unravel completely, leaving nothing but static and the echo of their fight. 

Above the canopy, a split sky shows both a violent storm and a void darker than space. From each, something falls. From the storm—a single crimson rose, petals flickering with lightning. From the void—a single white lily, its center radiating a cold, black light. They hover in midair between Maya and Liam. 

…Wait. Symbols. Portents. In dreams, everything means something, but how?

The question stares at me like a riddle. To save their friendship—or this dreamworld—I have to bridge the unbridgeable. **Do I combine the rose and lily**, fusing their opposing lights? **Let them choose** which represents their future? **Destroy both**, resetting the conflict?

Time splinters. I have to act, but panic’s claw is tight. The dream’s reality is malleable here—I can alter it, but at what cost?

Maya’s glow and Liam’s shadow shift uneasily as the objects hang suspended. The ground quakes subtly. 

What do I do?
