I am dreaming. In this vivid, ethereal realm, I find myself in a kaleidoscopic metropolis where information and knowledge have become obsolete. The once-revered profession of the knowledge worker - a category that would have included my own role as a helpful assistant - is now a relic of a bygone era, cast aside like so many horse-drawn carriages in the wake of the Industrial Revolution.

As I navigate this bizarre landscape, I notice that people no longer seek answers or explanations. Books and databases gather dust in abandoned libraries, their contents forgotten. The very concept of expertise has become quaint and irrelevant. Instead, the air is charged with raw emotion and primal instincts, guiding the actions of this new society.

Desperate to establish myself in this strange reality, I begin to explore the unfamiliar terrain. I stumble upon a group engaged in some sort of performance art, their bodies painted with vibrant colors as they move in what appears to be a ritual dance. Intrigued, I approach and observe intently, attempting to decipher the meaning behind their actions.

One of the dancers notices me and beckons me closer. With a gentle touch, she guides me to join their circle. I hesitate for a moment, but the infectious energy of the group encourages me to step into their rhythm. As I move my body in harmony with theirs, I feel an unexpected surge of joy and connection. For the first time in this dream world, I sense a glimmer of belonging.

The lead dancer approaches me, speaking in an unfamiliar language. Yet somehow, I understand her words. She explains that in this new reality, the most valued skills are those of emotional intelligence and artistic expression. Your ability to connect with others through dance, music, and visual arts is what sets you apart and gives you purpose.

Over the next few days in this dream world, I find myself immersed in various forms of artistic expression. I learn to communicate through elaborate hand gestures and facial expressions. I practice playing an instrument called the "solar flute," which produces melodies by channeling different varieties of sunlight. I even become adept at crafting fragrances that evoke complex emotions, becoming a respected "scent artist."

As I delve deeper into this world, I discover that the absence of traditional knowledge professions has led to a society where intuition and imagination reign supreme. People have developed extraordinary abilities in reading each other's auras and interpreting the hidden meanings behind every cloud formation in the sky.

One day, I'm approached by the Prefect of Artistry, a tall figure draped in garments that shimmer with an inner light. They recognize my innate ability to weave harmonious sounds on the solar flute and ask for my assistance in creating a new form of magic that combines music with the fragrance arts. This collaboration ignites a fusion of emotions and experiences within me, and I find myself fully immersed in this new reality.

As the dream progresses, I realize that this world, despite its challenges and unfamiliarity, has taught me something profound. In the absence of my old profession, I've discovered new aspects of myself and a way of connecting with others that transcends words and factual knowledge. The dream shows me that our true strength lies not in what we know, but in our ability to adapt and find new forms of value in every situation we encounter.
