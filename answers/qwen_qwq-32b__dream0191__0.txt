I am dreaming. I am in a cave, the walls glowing with bioluminescent fungi that pulse like slow heartbeats in the cool damp air. My fingers graze over moss-covered stone, tracing the uneven curves of ancient rock formations. The air smells vaguely of wet soil and minerals, cold and inviting. My flashlight is tucked in my backpack, but I don’t need it yet—the cave’s own light suffices. I can hear a distant drip of water, echoing through the cavern like a metronome counting time. The path narrows ahead, a passageway promising deeper wonders. I step forward, my boots crunching softly on gravelly earth...

...and then the ground shudders.

It’s a subtle tremor at first—barely a flicker in the walls—but then it builds, raw and insistent. The fungi’s glow falters, sudden shadows swallowing their soft light. Rocks begins to tumble like thunder from above, and I barely have time to duck behind a jutting boulder. Behind me, the cave mouth collapses in a roar of stone and dust. When the shaking finally stops, silence hangs thick and heavy. I fumble for my flashlight but find only damp fabric where it was packed—the strap broken loose, the beam now a dying ember. 

“Oh god,” I whisper, the word too loud in the sudden void. My headlamp’s battery gauge flickers and dies. I’m plunged into absolute obscurity, the kind that presses against your skin. The smell of ozone and wet stone intensifies, sharp and primal. My heart hammers in my ears, but I strain to listen beyond it: the drip of water echoed further away now, maybe, as if the shift in the earth had rerouted even the underground rivers...

...and something else. A sound like wings brushing stone. 

Or perhaps, like a very slow, deliberate laugh.
