I am dreaming. —I notice my fingertips tingling as if they’re brushing velvet, and my heart beats in my chest with the hush and pulse of distant thunder. The air feels heavy against my skin, humming with an unseen electricity, and I shiver—not with cold, but with the strange thrill of anticipation. My breath quickens, unbidden, moving with a secret urgency. The soles of my feet press deeper into soft, yielding ground—moss, perhaps, or a living, breathing cloud.

It is in these mounting sensations—a flutter in the stomach, a sudden tightness behind my eyes—that I sense something magnificent is about to reveal itself. I slow my breathing, focusing on the rhythmic rise and fall of my chest, the warmth gathering and swirling in my palms. My body’s signals become a compass, guiding me further into this dream realm.

I open my eyes to a world awash in color: violets and sapphires streak the sky above a jeweled forest, and each leaf shimmers with an inner light. The trees sway in time with my pulse, and the air is alive with the distant echo of laughter and song, as though the earth remembers joy at a cellular level. With every heartbeat, the landscape shifts and responds, blooming in tandem with my inner world.

My steps are feather-light, and as I move forward, the path unfurls beneath me like a ribbon of spun gold. Each sensation blossoms into a memory—of exhilaration, curiosity, and wonder—growing brighter the more I pay attention, the more I dwell in this surreal and boundless place. 

By attuning to my body’s responses, I realize I am not just a visitor here—I am the architect of this dream. The world around me bends and thrives in response to the hidden language of my nerves and breath, and I walk on, eager to see which marvels my deepest self will create next.
