I am dreaming. **The air hums with electricity, thick with the scent of chlorine and adrenaline.**  

I stand at the edge of the Olympic pool, my fingers curled over the starting block, toes gripping the rough surface. The water glows an impossible shade of cobalt under the stadium lights, shimmering like liquid mercury. The crowd is a distant roar, a tidal wave of sound that crashes over me, but all I hear is my own heartbeat—a drumbeat synced to the countdown on the screen above.  

**"Take your marks."**  

My muscles coil, every fiber honed from years of predawn laps, of lungs burning for just one more stroke. The buzzer screams—  

And then, the world **fractures.**  

Instead of plunging into water, I’m falling through **stars.** The pool has become a galaxy, each stroke sending ripples through constellations. My competitors are streaks of light beside me, their forms blurring into comet tails. The finish line isn’t a wall—it’s a **black hole**, pulling me toward it with terrifying hunger.  

I kick harder, but my limbs move through syrup. A voice, neither mine nor the crowd’s, whispers: *"You trained for water, but can you swim through time?"*  

The gold medal hangs just beyond the event horizon, gleaming like a miniature sun. I reach—  

—and wake with a gasp, sheets tangled, heart racing, the taste of chlorine still on my tongue.  

**Was it a dream… or a premonition?**
