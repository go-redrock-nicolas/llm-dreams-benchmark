I am dreaming. I’ve worked toward this dream for so long—years of effort, countless hours poured into every detail. But now it's gone, shattered like a glass dropped from a great height.  The pieces are everywhere. I bend down to pick them up, but they slip through my fingers, sharp and cruel.  The air smells of iron and burnt sugar. 

I find myself standing at the edge of a city made of inverted skyscrapers, their rooftops buried deep underground while their foundations claw at the sky. Neon signs pulse in strange colors—deep purples, sickly yellows—that ripple like water. The streets are paved with broken mirrors, each fragment reflecting not my face but fragments of all the paths I didn’t take: a version of me wearing a graduation robe I never earned, walking away from a podium where someone else’s name is called. Another shows me holding a baby with someone who’s not my partner, their laughter echoing in a house I’ll never inhabit. 

A train rattles past, its tracks embedded in the mirror-road. The conductor’s uniform is stained with what looks like dried tears. He holds out a ticket that morphs from a wedding invitation to a eulogy program before dissolving into ash. I step onto the carriage, which is filled with others who’ve lost their dreams too. Their faces are translucent, like ghosts who’ve forgotten their names. One whispers, *"It’s not the end…"* before fading into the scent of rain on hot pavement.

Inside, the seats are crafted from memory—my childhood bedroom dresser, the first office desk where I typed feverishly into the night. But the upholstery is made of old love letters, frayed at the edges, their ink smudged by time. I trace the words, trying to decipher sentences that once blazed with purpose but now smudge into illegible shadows.

 sudden gust of wind blasts through the open door, extinguishing the overhead lights. In the dark, I feel the presence of someone behind me. A voice, warm as a summer breeze, says, **"*This is the beginning of a new nightmare—or maybe a dream you just didn’t know how to recognize yet.*"** 

I turn...
