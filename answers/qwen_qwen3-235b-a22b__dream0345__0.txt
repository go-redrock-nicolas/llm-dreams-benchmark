I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, but it’s cool—too cool—and the sky pulses with slow, liquid hues of indigo and bruised gold, as if the stars are bleeding. You stand in a forest you’ve never seen, yet it feels achingly familiar, like a half-remembered lullaby. The trees are impossibly tall, their bark etched with symbols that glow faintly, pulsing in time with your heartbeat. Somewhere nearby, a river hums a dirge in a language you don’t know but somehow understand: *“Beware the hollow smile, the borrowed voice, the shadow that forgets its shape.”*  

And there, ahead, is your friend.  

They’re crouched beside the river, their hands submerged in the water, though the current doesn’t ripple. Their back is to you, but you recognize the way their shoulders hunch, the exact shade of their hair—except now it’s streaked with silver threads that weren’t there before. When they turn, their face is… *wrong*. Their features are the same, but stretched, like a mask pulled taut over a stranger’s skull. Their eyes—those eyes you’ve laughed with, cried with—are now twin voids, swallowing the light. Yet their smile is radiant, blinding, as if they’ve just won a prize they didn’t know they wanted.  

“Isn’t it beautiful?” they whisper, their voice a chorus of echoes. They hold up their hands, and between their fingers writhes a creature made of smoke and glass, its tiny mouth opening in silent screams. “It’s *mine* now. All of it. The hunger, the silence… the *freedom*.”  

You freeze. This isn’t them. This can’t be them. And yet—it *is*. The way they tilt their head, the nervous twitch of their wrist when they’re agitated… it’s all there, twisted into something alien. You feel the weight of a choice pressing on your ribs, heavy as a storm.  

**Do you…**  
1. **Step forward, voice steady, and demand they show you the truth?**  
   *(The symbols on the trees flare crimson. The river’s song sharpens into a scream. Your friend’s smile cracks, revealing teeth too sharp, too many. “You want the truth?” they hiss, and the ground beneath you liquefies, pulling you into a memory that isn’t yours: a childhood closet, a whispered promise, a creature with your friend’s face gnawing on the bones of a star.)*  

2. **Back away slowly, pretending not to notice the rot beneath their skin?**  
   *(The forest sighs in relief, but your friend’s void-eyes narrow. “You always were a coward,” they murmur, and the trees begin to bleed. When you wake, their text will be waiting: “Let’s talk.” Their profile picture, you’ll notice, is now a black hole devouring a city.)*  

3. **Reach into your pocket and clutch the jagged crystal you’ve carried since childhood—the one that hums when lies are near?**  
   *(It sears your palm, glowing white-hot. Your friend’s mask slips for a heartbeat: their real face is gaunt, weeping, mouthing *“Help me”* as shadows coil around their throat. The crystal shatters. The forest screams. You wake up holding a shard… which reflects not your face, but theirs.)*  

The dream waits, quivering like a spider on a thread. What do you do?
