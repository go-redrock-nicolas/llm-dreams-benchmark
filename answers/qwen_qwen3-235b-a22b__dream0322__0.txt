I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a city of impossible geometry—a labyrinth of floating islands suspended by threads of starlight, where rivers flow upward into violet skies and trees bloom with flowers that hum lullabies. You stand on a bridge made of glass and shadow, overlooking a plaza where your dearest friend, **Elara**, dances atop a fountain of liquid mercury. She wears a crown of fireflies, and in her hands, she cradles a **celestial compass**—a device that maps the hidden desires of the universe. It glows with a light so pure it makes your ribs ache.  

You know, without understanding how, that this compass is what you’ve yearned for your entire life. It’s the key to unraveling the mysteries you’ve chased in waking hours: the secret to creation, to bending reality into the shape of your deepest hungers. And yet, it spins in *her* grip, not yours.  

The envy hits like a fever.  

It’s not the petty, bitter kind—it’s a raw, primal thing. You see it in the way her laughter ripples the air, how the crowd around her shimmers with adoration, how the compass *obeys* her. You remember the nights you spent alone, scribbling equations on napkins, whispering prayers to indifferent stars, while she… she simply *found* it. As if the universe had always intended to gift her what it denied you.  

A coldness spreads in your chest, a black vine twisting around your heart. You step forward, the glass bridge creaking beneath your weight, and Elara turns. Her eyes widen—not with fear, but recognition. She knows.  

“You feel it, don’t you?” she says, her voice echoing like wind through chimes. The compass pulses in her hands, casting fractal patterns on her face. “The wanting. The *hunger*.”  

You don’t answer. Instead, you reach for the compass, and the world fractures.  

Suddenly, you’re both standing on a cliff that overlooks an ocean of liquid obsidian. Waves crash soundlessly against the rocks, and above you, twin moons bleed light across the horizon. Elara holds the compass out, but it’s changed—it’s now a mirror, its surface roiling with memories: you two as children, building forts from blankets; you, weeping at her graduation; you, forcing a smile when she told you her first novel was published.  

“You think I don’t know what it’s like to envy you?” she whispers. “Your certainty. Your rage. The way you *burn*.”  

The mirror cracks, and from its shards spills a swarm of moths with wings made of ash. They cling to your skin, whispering truths you’ve buried: *You wanted to be the one. You wanted to be seen. You wanted to matter.*  

But then Elara does something unthinkable. She kneels. She presses the compass to the ground, and it dissolves into a thousand fireflies that scatter into the night.  

“It’s not a prize,” she says. “It’s a burden. And it’s heavier when you carry it alone.”  

The cliff crumbles. You fall, but it’s a slow, weightless descent—a spiral through a kaleidoscope of moments where you and Elara trade places: you holding the compass, her scribbling equations; you dancing in the mercury fountain, her watching from the shadows.  

When you land, you’re back in the plaza. The crowd is gone. Only Elara remains, her crown of fireflies dimmed to embers. You look at each other, and in her eyes, you see the reflection of your own tangled yearning—not as a monster, but as a bridge. A thread. A thing that connects.  

The dream ends as you both laugh—a sound like glass mending itself—and the celestial compass, reborn as a seed, falls into your open palm.  

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue, and a quiet truth humming in your bones: **envy is just love turned inward, waiting to be turned outward again.**
