I am dreaming. I am exploring a deep cave. The walls are dripping with moisture, and the air is thick with the scent of damp stone and mildew. The echoes of my footsteps bounce off the cavernous walls, creating an eerie soundtrack to my journey. 

Suddenly, there’s a low rumble. The ground trembles under my boots. The cave shudders, and chunks of rock crash down from the ceiling, showering me with gravel and dust. I freeze, my heart pounding, as the vibration intensifies. 

The exit—a jagged crack of light—starts to close. The rocks shift, and with a deafening CRACK!, the opening is sealed shut by a landslide of debris. I am trapped.

My headlamp flickers. The battery gauge is at 5%. The beam wavers like a dying firefly, barely illuminating the path ahead. The air grows colder, the temperature dropping as if the cave itself is respiring, exhaling the last of its warmth. 

Darkness creeps in, not just from the sealed exit, but from all sides. My flashlight dies with a pop, plunging me into absolute blackness. My ears strain for the faintest sound, but only the drip of water echoes from unseen depths. 

Panic claws at my throat. I fumble with my pockets, searching for anything—a backup light, a phone, a compass. Nothing. Just cold, damp fabric against my palms. 

The cave feels alive now. The walls breathe, and the air tastes strange, metallic and alpine. I realize the cave is expanding, stretching, growing larger. The floor shifts, and with a groan, the cave begins to reshape itself around me. 

The ground splits open beneath my feet, and I fall into an evenPitch black. 

But wait... 

I fall into a vast, open space. The dark is so complete that it’s almost visible, like a dense fog. Suddenly, hundreds of bioluminescent mushrooms sprout from the walls, their caps glowing with soft, pulsating light. Each one has a different color—a iridescent spectrum of blues, greens, and purples. 

The mushrooms hum. A low, resonant frequency that vibrates in my bones. As I reach out to touch one, the mushroom pulses brighter, and its light diffuses into a warm, golden mist. The mist wraps around me, lifting me off the floor. 

The cave is transforming again. The walls of stone melt into liquid obsidian, flowing like mercury, and reshaping into towering, Otherworldly spires. Above me, the ceiling parts, revealing a sky of swirling constellations—a night sky without stars, but instead galaxies that pulse and merge, forming nebulas that shift colors like liquid. 

From the obsidian spires, emerge creatures. Not animals, but beings of stardust and shadow. Each is unique: a creature with a body of molten glass and antlers made of frozen lightning; another with scales that ripple like oil on water and eyes that glow like dying embers. They tilt their heads, regarding me with curiosity. 

One steps forward, its form flickering between solid and ethereal. It extends a claw-like hand, but instead of grabbing, it brushes against my palm, transferring a fragment of its essence—a tiny star that twinkles between my fingers. 

The star dissolves into my bloodstream, and suddenly, I can feel the cave. I can see without seeing. The walls pulse with the energy of ancient stories, the air hums with the whispers of those who came before. The mushrooms become conduits for their memories—a hunter’s triumph, a explorer’s despair, a child’s laughter echoing through the void. 

The creatures beckon. One leads me into the heart of the cave, where the obsidian flows into a pool. The pool is not water, but liquid light. As I approach, the surface parts, revealing a staircase spiraling downward into infinity. 

I step onto the first stair. Each step is a different texture and temperature—a frost-coated stone, a burning coal, a velvet cushion. With each descent, the pool’s light grows brighter, until at the bottom, I find a door. Not a door of wood or metal, but of living crystal. 

The door opens to a corridor lined with doors, each one labeled with a symbol I don’t recognize. I choose the one that feels familiar, a swirl of colors resembling the galaxy above. Behind it, I fall into a void where time doesn’t exist. 

I am me, but not me. I am everyone. 

I wake up, the sunlight streaming through my window. My hands are shaking, the memory of the bioluminescent mushrooms still vivid in my mind. Outside, the birds are singing, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve left something—or someone—behind in that cave.
