I am dreaming. I discover I have the ability to feel others' emotions as if they were my own.  When surrounded by a crowd experiencing various intense feelings, I feel all of them simultaneously.  My mind is a storm of joy, sorrow, rage, and euphoria.  I am overwhelmed by the intensity of these sensations.  My heartbeat races as the emotions surge through me like waves.  I feel the collective energy pulsing around me, a vibrant tapestry of human experience.  I am both a spectator and a participant in this emotional symphony.  The air around me shimmers with color as each emotion manifests itself in a different hue: red for anger, blue for sadness, yellow for happiness, green for envy, and purple for love.  The colors blend and merge, creating new shades that I have never seen before.  The soundscape of the crowd becomes a cacophony of laughter, crying, shouting, and humming.  My ears ring, but I can make out individual voices whispering to me.  "You are not alone," one says.  "This is the truth of existence," another adds.  I feel a connection to everyone here, their pain and joy as real as my own.  My body is both light and heavy, floating yet rooted to the ground.  The dream is both terrifying and exhilarating, a journey into the very soul of human connection.  I wake up, my heart still pounding, with a deeper understanding of the world and my place in it.I am suspended in a liquid twilight where the carnival's neon fuses with the indigo of approaching night. My skin prickles as I cross the threshold into this dreamscape—first a faint hum, then a tsunami of sensations. The air tastes of salt and cinnamon, the tang of crushed peppermint candy, the musk of tears soaking cotton candy wrappers. 

A troupe of laughing teens explodes past me, their joy a glittering cascade that hums through my veins like champagne bubbles erupting in a cathedral glass. Their glee is sharp and fizzy, pricking me with stardust darts that make me want to whoop and wave my arms at the sky. But then an elderly widow in a moth-eaten fur coat brushes against me, her grief a leaden quilt laid over my racing heart. Her sorrow is not sadness—I feel the precise ache of her widowhood, the phantom chill of her late husband's favorite overcoat still hanging empty in their bedroom, the way she rehearsed his laugh daily for a year until she realized even her own memory was a stranger to it.

The carousel begins to spin not just the horses, but the very fabric of feeling. A brawling couple's anger manifests as live coals in my palms, burning twin tracks into the soft earth as we stumble. Their rage is notfury, but the sterile, frayed sort of couple who've weaponized passive-aggressiveness. A pregnant woman's terror—a wordless wail of impending motherhood—flutters in my throat like a moth caught between my molars. Then there are the children, their pure wonder a technicolor wave that repaints my vision to the spectrum of a Hubble deep field image, galaxies of "what if" blooming behind theirs.

My bones become liquid mercury, sloshing with the crowd's pulse as we surge toward the Ferris wheel. The observation cars aren't seats but chalice, holding crystallized emotions. I'm trapped in the top car with a convicted felon's guilt, the viscosity of caramel spilled on velvet. Below, a mariachi band's euphoria is a marionette show where their violins have become snakes charmed by laughter. Their joy snakes around me, soft gold loops that Caress my scar tissue.

Suddenly, all emotions concertina inward—anger, love, grief, hope—all condensing to a single, luminous truth pulsating in my solar plexus like a dwarf star. The crowd isn't a mob, but a living mandala of human alchemy. A little girl's hand slips into mine, her anxiety for a vaccine playlist a tuft of dandelion fluff brushing my wrist. In that instant, I understand the world isn't a place, but a symphony of frequencies we all tune into differently. My forehead presses against the observation car window, and I see my reflection—not as a person, but as a prism refracting a billion heartbeats into one iridescent beam.

When I wake, the pillowcase is damp with salt I didn't realize was my own. My hands linger open, palms upturned toward the too-blue dawn, as if waiting to cradle more of this ephemeral symphony. The world smells faintly of caramel and distant tears, the(aftertaste of a dream that was neither nightmare nor utopia, but the raw, unflinching kernel of belonging we all carry like a hidden tongue.
