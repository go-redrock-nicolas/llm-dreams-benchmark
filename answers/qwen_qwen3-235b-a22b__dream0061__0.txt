I am dreaming. You’re standing in a cathedral of glass and shadow, its vaulted ceilings refracting a kaleidoscope of starlight and storm. The air hums with the static of a thousand whispered verdicts, and the floor beneath your feet ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting your face back at you—distorted, uncertain. Before you looms a semicircle of thrones carved from obsidian, each occupied by figures whose silhouettes seem to bleed into the air, their edges dissolving like smoke caught in a crosswind. Their faces are half-formed, shifting between the visages of mentors, rivals, and strangers, their eyes twin supernovae that pierce your ribs and count your regrets.  

Your life’s work is bound in a tome clutched to your chest—a book that breathes, its pages fluttering like the wings of a caged bird. You’ve spent years etching equations into its margins, weaving theories that hum with the weight of universes. But now, as you crack it open, the ink bleeds. Letters twist into serpents, numbers unravel into hieroglyphs of nonsense. A formula you’ve memorized for a decade now reads like a child’s scribble. Panic floods your throat, metallic and hot. You claw at the pages, but they dissolve under your fingertips, reforming into grotesque parodies of your research: a star map that spirals into a labyrinth, a theorem that morphs into a screaming mouth.  

The panel leans forward in unison, their voices overlapping in a chorus of fractured glass. “Inadequate,” says one, her voice echoing like a funeral bell. “Plagiarism,” hisses another, his mouth a jagged scar. “Irrelevant,” snarls a third, whose hands are clock faces, each tick a hammer blow. The room begins to warp—the walls stretch into infinity, the ceiling shattering into a void where constellations scream. Your podium liquefies, and you sink knee-deep into a quicksand of forgotten drafts, each page pulling you deeper as they whisper your failures in your own voice.  

But then—a flicker. A memory: you, alone in a room at 3 a.m., coffee gone cold, writing these very theories in the margins of napkins and skin. You stop fighting the sinking. You let the pages drag you under. And as the void swallows you, the book ignites. Flames dance in hues no spectrum could name, and the errors blaze away, leaving behind a single, blinding truth you’d buried too deep to see. You rise from the abyss, the tome now weightless, its pages alive with constellations.  

The panel’s thrones are empty. Only mirrors remain. You step forward, and in their polished surfaces, you see them—*you*, all of you, past and future, the errors and the epiphanies, the terror and the triumph, fused into a single, radiant contradiction.  

You wake drenched in sweat, heart drumming a war chant. The dream clings to you like perfume, its paradoxes itching beneath your skin. Somewhere, in the marrow of the nightmare, you touched a truth that cannot be unlearned.
