I am dreaming. I find myself on a spiral staircase that descends infinitely through shifting architecture. Each step pulses with a faint luminescence, responding to my footfalls with ripples of cerulean light. The walls around me continually transform—sometimes weathered stone covered in phosphorescent moss, sometimes translucent crystal revealing impossible landscapes beyond, sometimes nothing but swirling mist that solidifies only when I reach out to touch it.

As I descend, I notice I'm being followed by a figure who mirrors my movements exactly. When I pause, they pause. When I accelerate, they match my pace. Their features are constantly rearranging—sometimes resembling my mother, sometimes a childhood friend, sometimes a stranger with familiar eyes. I recognize this as the person with whom I've been locked in endless cycles of misunderstanding and hurt.

At a landing where the staircase splits into three directions, I stop. Instead of continuing downward as I always have before, I turn to face my pursuer. The figure freezes, startled by the break in pattern. Words form in my throat but emerge as butterflies of spun glass, each carrying fragments of unspoken truths between us.

The figure reaches out, catching one butterfly on their fingertip. As it dissolves, understanding floods their eyes. The staircase begins to reshape itself, steps rising and falling like piano keys, creating a bridge rather than a descent. The walls around us become mirrors reflecting not our present selves, but countless possible futures—some where we walk together, others where our paths diverge peacefully.

I reach out my hand. The figure hesitates, then extends theirs. Our fingers touch, and the entire structure around us collapses into a rain of tiny stars that gather into a vast, breathing garden suspended in twilight, where every conflict we've ever had blooms as strange, beautiful flowers that finally have room enough to grow without choking each other.
