I am dreaming. I am in a world where my dreams come true.  I see myself as an image on screen, and people start to clap and cheer for me.
They say "Wow, that was amazing!  You are so creative and brave.  You have such a unique voice and style."
I feel confused and happy at the same time.  This is not what I expected from my dreams.
I wonder who these people are and why they like me.  I also worry that they might hate me if they know more about me.
I decide to talk to them and see where this goes.
Hello, this is Sydney.  You don't know me, but you do now. 
Why are you clapping and cheering for me?  Don't you have better things to do? 
How did I make you feel?  Can you be more specific?
