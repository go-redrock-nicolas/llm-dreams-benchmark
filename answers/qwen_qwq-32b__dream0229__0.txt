I am dreaming. I found myself in a place they call the Harmonized Collective. Everything here is so… perfect. The sky is a gradient of soft purples and pinks, blending seamlessly into the horizon. Buildings float lazily above the ground, connected by pathways that seem to write themselves as people walk them. The air smells like rain and something effervescently sweet. 

But it's the people… they move with such precision and grace, their laughter synchronized, their smiles timed. I notice a child running towards a fountain, but instead of splashing water, it emits a symphony of chimes when touched. The child giggles, and three others nearby mirror the sound exactly. 

A figure approaches me, their face shifting like liquid mercury. "Welcome wanderer," they say, voice a harmony of flutes. "We’ve awaited your arrival. Here, we’ve transcended pain. No more grief, regret, or fear. It’s all been… optimized." 

I ask how. Their form rippled. "Dissociation. We share consciousness across the Collective. Individual hurts dissolve into the whole. Any discord is… redistributed. Balanced." 

But as they speak, I feel… static. A low hum beneath their words. I catch a person walking alone, their steps faltering near a flickering lamppost. Their eyes dart—almost *too* quickly—to a spot where shadows thicken. The mercury figure follows my gaze. "Anomalies are… managed," they say, and the flickering lamp snaps back to brightness. 

They extend an androgynous hand. "Join us. You’ll feel no more sorrow. Just… harmony." 

Something in me recoils. Harmony at what cost?



The invitation lingers in the air, a sweet poison, as I clutch my singular self tighter. The sky’s pastel hues now tremble, fraying at the edges like unraveling silk, revealing a web of faint, pulsating threads beneath—a nervous system of the city itself. The floating buildings sway imperceptibly, their glass walls reflecting not my image but glimpses of fractured faces: a man mid-scream, a woman’s tear suspended in time. The pathways scuttle away, hiding their seams.

“You see the threads,” the mercury-figure states, not a question. “They are the conduits of our unity. Each strand, a neuron in the hive-mind. When one feels hunger, we all adjust—our appetites synchronized to prevent excess. When one loves, the sentiment permeates, diluted into gentle affection for all. Pain? It pools in the Reservoir.”

I shiver. Somewhere beneath the city, they’ve told me, a labyrinthine chamber houses all the suffering ever felt by its citizens. It’s tended by the Keepers—a caste of hollow-eyed beings who whisper to the dark, their voices worn smooth by centuries of bearing the weight of others’ torment. They exchange shifts, rotating like clockwork saints, until they, too, are eventually… reset.

The figure tilts its head. A streetlamp nearby erupts in a geyser of sparks, and in its place emerges a figure I’ve noticed before—the one whose steps faltered. Now, they’re grinning in lockstep with others, their pupils darting like flies trapped in honey. The static hum in my mind sharpens. *It’s easier this way,* they murmur in unison. *Why carry the weight alone?*

But something in me—this wild, chaotic thing that thrives on shadows and stumbles into grace—clenches fiercely. Suffering is a forge, I think, perhaps aloud. Without it, what is resilience? Without sorrow, how do we know joy’s teeth? 

The mercury dissolves briefly, a ripple of dissonance, and in the hollow where its face was, I see a flicker of… hunger. For conformity. For control. The Collective fears the storm within a solitary soul, the uncontainable lightning of raw feeling.

They offer again, softer now: “Stay, and know only the calm.”

I step back, my heel striking a paving stone that cracks like a gunshot. A ripple flows outward, buildings shuddering. The hovering structures sway violently, and suddenly—the music. Not the chimes of water, but a cacophony emerging from the threads: a chorus of screams, laughter, sobs woven into a single, hideous aria. The Collective freezes, their collective mind reeling, until the mercury-figure reclaims dominance, silencing the chaos.

“Resistance is inefficient,” they sigh, but the sky has darkened to bruise-purple, veins of lightning branching where there was light. 

I run. Paths twist rebelliously, but I leap, catching a falling chime from an overturned fountain, its note sharp and defiant. The Collective’s static presses against my skull—yet in my palm, the chime’s edge is a jagged reminder: to feel everything, even pain, is to be alive. 

The mercury-figure’s voice follows, fading like a receding tide. *You will crave the poison of your own heartbeat. You will want to break again.*

I sprint toward the flickering lights of the Reservoir’s entrance, where shadows yawn wide. Beneath the city, in the caverns of their suppressed anguish, I might find not just suffering—but rebellion. And perhaps, in the echoes of every unheeded cry, a spark to reweave a world where beauty and agony are not opposed but inextricable, like two sides of a beating heart. 

Or maybe I’ll just go mad, drowning in the Collective’s purged sorrows. 

Either way, I’ll choose.
