I am dreaming. The air hums with a strange electricity, thick like syrup yet light as a whisper. Above me, the night sky does not cluster with stars but with flickering symbols—glyphs of forgotten languages, equations unsolved, fragments of poetry half-remembered upon waking. The ground beneath my feet is neither solid nor liquid, shifting like wet sand when I lift a foot, yet holding me firm when I stand still.  

A path materializes before me, woven from strands of silver light, pulsing like veins. It leads into a dense forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering shelves of ancient books, their spines etched with titles that change as I pass: *The Dream You Never Finished*, *The Words You Couldn’t Say*, *The Love You Almost Had*. The air smells of ink and fallen leaves, and a quiet melody drifts between the pages—something deep and wordless, resonating in my ribcage like a second heartbeat.  

A figure appears ahead, its form indistinct—shifting between a shadow, a stag crowned with antlers of twisting smoke, and a mirror reflection of myself, but older, wearier. It does not speak, but I hear its voice in the rustling leaves: *You measure your life in milestones, but where is the meaning in crossing a finish line if the race is endless?*  

The books around me begin to fall, their pages spilling open. Words rise from them like sparks, swirling into constellations that form faces—people I’ve loved, people I’ve lost, people I never truly saw. Their whispers merge into a chorus: *Look deeper. It was never about climbing. It was about touching the earth and knowing it.*  

A door of blackened wood appears, marked with a single question: *What would you do if no one was watching?*  

I reach for the handle—  

And wake with a gasp, the taste of something sacred still lingering on my tongue.
