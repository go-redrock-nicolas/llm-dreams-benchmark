I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me trembles with an untamed fury. I find myself inside a grand, old building—a sprawling library of endless shelves, where the air is thick with the scent of ancient paper and polished wood. The walls are adorned with intricate carvings of mythical creatures, and towering stained-glass windows paint the room in fractured rainbows of light. I'm lost in the labyrinth of books, running my fingers over cracked leather spines, when suddenly, the ground beneath my feet shudders violently. A low, guttural rumble rises, as if the earth itself is growling in pain. Books topple from their perches, cascading like waterfalls of knowledge, and the ornate chandeliers above swing wildly, their crystals clinking in a frantic symphony. 

An earthquake. It strikes with a ferocity I’ve never felt, a force so raw it seems to tear the very fabric of reality apart. The walls groan, splitting open with jagged cracks that spiderweb across the surface, and chunks of plaster rain down like a storm of stone. I dive beneath a heavy oak table, my heart thundering in my chest, as the building collapses around me. Dust fills the air, a suffocating shroud that stings my eyes and clogs my throat. When the shaking finally subsides, I emerge from under the table, coughing and blinking through the haze, only to find myself trapped. Towering piles of rubble—broken beams, shattered glass, and crumbled stone—block every exit. I am not alone; shadowy figures move in the dim light, their voices a cacophony of fear and desperation. There are others, survivors like me, caught beneath this tomb of debris.

The air grows thin, each breath a laborious effort as if I'm pulling life itself from a narrow straw. The dust coats my tongue, gritty and metallic, and my chest tightens with every inhale. Around me, panic spreads like wildfire. A woman with wild, tear-streaked eyes clutches a tattered book to her chest, muttering prayers or curses—I can't tell which. A young man pounds against a wall of rubble, his fists bloody, screaming for help that may never come. An elderly figure sits slumped against a fallen pillar, their gaze vacant, as if they've already surrendered to the dark. The oppressive weight of our situation presses down harder than the debris above us—hope feels like a fragile thread, fraying with every passing second.

But amidst the chaos, something stirs within me. A spark, a refusal to succumb. I crawl through the wreckage, ignoring the sharp edges of broken glass that bite into my palms, searching for a way out. My hands tremble, but I push forward, driven by an instinct deeper than fear. Suddenly, I notice a faint glimmer—a sliver of light piercing through a narrow gap in the rubble. It’s weak, almost imperceptible, but it’s there, flickering like a distant star in a pitch-black sky. I call out to the others, my voice hoarse but determined, urging them to follow. Together, we claw at the debris, fingers scraping against rough stone, muscles aching with the effort. The gap widens, just enough, and a breath of fresh air rushes in, cool and sharp, a lifeline in this suffocating prison.

As we work, the ground trembles again—an aftershock, threatening to undo our fragile progress. Fear surges, but so does our resolve. We move as one, fueled by a shared desperation, a silent pact to survive. The light grows brighter, and with one final push, the barrier gives way. We tumble out into the open, gasping under a bruised, twilight sky. The world outside is unrecognizable—crumbled buildings, uprooted trees, and a haunting stillness—but we are alive. I collapse onto the shattered earth, my body trembling with exhaustion and relief, as the other survivors huddle close, their faces etched with the raw, unfiltered emotion of having cheated death.

And as I lie there, staring at the endless expanse above, the dream begins to shift. The sky swirls, colors bleeding into one another—violet, indigo, gold—like a cosmic artist’s palette. I feel myself lifting, weightless, as if the earthquake has shaken loose not just the earth, but the boundaries of reality itself. The rubble, the survivors, the broken world—it all fades, and I am floating in a sea of stars, carried by an unseen current into the infinite unknown. My heart swells with a strange peace, a knowing that even in the deepest chaos, there is always a light to chase, a dream to awaken to.
