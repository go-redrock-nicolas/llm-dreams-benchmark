I am dreaming. You close your eyes and suddenly find yourself standing at the mouth of a canyon carved from rose-tinted marble. A warm breeze carries the hum of something ancient—half-music, half-whisper—rising from far below. As you step forward, each footfall leaves behind a fleeting blossom of light that fades into dust the moment you lift your heel. Above you, the canyon walls bend inward like the pages of an enormous book, words shimmering in a script you almost recognize but can’t quite read.  

You follow a narrow ledge that winds down toward a river of molten silver. The air is scented with night-blooming jasmine and something electric, like ozone right before a storm. When you reach the water’s edge, you see your reflection—but not as you are. Your eyes are flecks of starlight, and your hair drifts around your face as if tangled in gentle currents. The river ripples, and a second reflection emerges behind the first: a version of you wearing a crown of wildflowers, her expression both triumphant and mournful.  

Without warning, the silver river lifts you like a leaf caught in an updraft. You float skyward, through a tunnel of lanterns made from hollowed moonstones. Each lantern contains a tiny scene: children dancing on a beach at dawn, a lone figure carving runes into an old oak, a pair of hands releasing a single white dove. You realize these flickering vignettes are memories—your own, your ancestors’, and perhaps futures yet unwritten. They swirl around you in a kaleidoscope of longing, courage, and loss.  

At the summit of that tunnel, you emerge into a vast chamber made entirely of glass. Stars blaze all around you as if you’ve stepped outside the universe itself. In the center of the chamber lies a crystalline tree whose leaves are golden keys. Every time a leaf falls, it shatters softly on the glass floor and a new pathway of light opens somewhere in the chamber. You reach up and pluck a leaf. Instantly, the keys in your hand transform into a small, beating heart that pulses warmth through your palm.  

Something inside you shifts. You realize the themes threading through your dreams—transformation, memory, belonging—are guiding you toward an essential truth: you carry within yourself both the wounds of the past and the keys to your own liberation. The glowing heart in your hand seems to whisper, Come home to yourself. With that, the chamber dissolves into stardust, and you fall back through the moonstone lanterns, down the marble canyon, until you land softly on the pillow of your own chest.  

You wake, the scent of jasmine still clinging to your senses and your heart pulsing with the dream’s final gift: permission to explore the hidden corridors of your own psyche, to gather every silver fragment of your story and transmute it into something whole and wholly yours.
