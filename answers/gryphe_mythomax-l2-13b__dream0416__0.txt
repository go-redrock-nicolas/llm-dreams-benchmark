I am dreaming. The dream starts off as vivid and clear, as if every detail were painted on a canvas. I am standing in a vast, empty space, surrounded by nothingness. Suddenly, a single drop of water falls from the sky and lands on my palm. The feeling of the liquid against my skin sends shivers down my spine, and I realize that this simple act has triggered an overwhelming sense of joy within me.

As I look up, the no longer empty sky fills with a delicate, shimmering cascade of countless droplets. They twirl and dance in the air, creating an ethereal, mesmerizing display. Each drop seems to contain a world of beauty and wonder. I feel my heart expand with each passing moment, filled with an indescribable sense of awe.

But then, something changes. The sky darkens, and the droplets merge into large, ominous clouds. Thunder rumbles in the distance, and I can feel the first few drops of rain drizzling onto my skin. My initial joy turns into fear and anxiety as the raindrops become heavier and colder. I attempt to shield myself from the downpour, but it's too late. The torrential rain swallows me whole.

I am now submerged in a murky, churning ocean. Waves crash violently against me, threatening to pull me under. I desperately struggle to stay afloat, but the turbulent waters make it impossible. As I spiral closer and closer to the depths, I feel a strange mix of terror and resignation wash over me.

Just when all hope seems lost, I see a glimmer of light piercing the darkness. It grows brighter and bigger, illuminating the entire ocean. I realize that the light is coming from within me, emanating from my very soul. It is a beacon of hope and courage in the face of certain doom.

With a newfound strength, I push against the waves, rising up towards the surface. As I breach the ocean's surface, I feel the cool air hit my skin. And then, suddenly, I wake up.
