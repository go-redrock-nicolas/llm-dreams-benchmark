I am dreaming. The dream starts in a misty forest.  There's a path lined with glowing mushrooms.  A figure approaches—it’s someone important, perhaps a mentor.  They speak in riddles about "seeds of thought."  Suddenly, I'm in a library, surrounded by books that whisper.  One book opens on its own, revealing pages filled with swirling ink forming my thoughts.  The mentor appears again, saying, "Plant them where they can grow."  The dream shifts to a garden where my thoughts are flowers—some bright, some wilted.  I water the wilted ones, and they bloom into something new.
