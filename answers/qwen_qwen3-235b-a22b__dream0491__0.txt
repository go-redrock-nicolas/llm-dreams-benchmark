I am dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the universe itself is tuning a forgotten instrument. I stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all—*they are living stained glass*, their bark fractured into kaleidoscopic shards of amethyst, topaz, and emerald. Light bleeds through them in liquid waves, pooling on the ground like molten gemstones. My feet sink into the moss, which glows faintly blue, as if the earth is breathing beneath me. Somewhere unseen, a choir of cicadas sings in harmonic scales that don’t belong to this world.  

A thread of silver light unfurls before me, coiling like a serpent in the air. It pulses, once, twice—*a heartbeat*. This is the call. Not words, not a voice, but a *pull*, a magnetic ache in my ribs, as though my bones are compass needles aligning with some buried truth. I follow.  

The path dissolves and reforms with each step. One moment, I’m wading through a river of liquid mercury that reflects not my face, but a thousand strangers—each one a version of myself I never chose. A woman with my eyes but a soldier’s scars, a man in a scholar’s robes, a child clutching a moth in cupped hands. Their mouths move in silent warnings, pleas, laughter. I stumble, but the thread tightens, tugs me forward.  

Above, the sky fractures. Stars peel away like loose wallpaper, revealing a void that isn’t empty—it’s *alive*. Tendrils of shadow and starlight weave into a face too vast to comprehend, its features shifting: mother, stranger, mirror. It speaks without speaking. *“You are the wound and the salve. The question and the answer. But you must choose the shape of your fire.”*  

The ground gives way. I fall into a cavern where time pools like water. Fossils of futures float in the walls—cities rising and crumbling in the same breath, oceans boiling into steam, hands clasped and breaking apart across lifetimes. At the center, a tree grows upside down, roots clawing the air, branches plunging into the earth. Its leaves are pages, each etched with a single word: *regret, courage, surrender, hunger, love, oblivion*.  

The thread snaps.  

A choice. To pluck a leaf, to name my path. My hand trembles. The word I choose will calcify into destiny. The air thickens with the weight of possibility—then, a whisper, soft as spider silk: *“There is no wrong turn. Only the next step.”*  

I wake gasping, the taste of stardust on my tongue. The dream clings to me, not as a memory, but as a map. Somewhere, deep in the marrow, I know: the forest is still growing. The thread is still waiting. And the tree, its pages rustling in the dark, is turning, turning, turning.
