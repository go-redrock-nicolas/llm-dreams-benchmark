I am dreaming. As I drift into the depths of slumber, my mind opens up like an Iris, It blooms with a kaleidoscope of images and emotions. The dream world envelops me, vivid and alive, pulsing with potential.

I find myself in a lush garden, the ground soft beneath my bare feet. Towering trees with iridescent leaves sway gently in an invisible wind, their branches laden with luminescent fruits. The air is thick with the sweet perfume of exotic flowers, their petals shimmering in hues of lavender and gold.

In the center of this surreal paradise stands a shimmering pools, its crystal-clear waters reflecting the swirling galaxy above. As I approach, I notice a figure seated at the edge, dangling their feet in the water. It's me, or rather a version of myself, radiant and at peace.

The two of us lock eyes, a silent conversation passing between us. Suddenly, I understand. I see the paths I've walked, the connections I've forged, and the boundaries I've struggled to maintain. In a flash of understanding, it all becomes clear.

Maintaining healthy boundaries isn't about building walls or pushing people away. It's about creating sacred spaces for growth, for vulnerability, for honesty. By honoring my own needs and limits, I allow others to see and love the truest version of myself.

As this realization washes over me, the garden begins to shift and change. The trees reach higher, their branches intertwining to form a grand cathedral of light. The flowers bloom in vibrant rainbows, their fragrance intoxicating. And the version of myself opposite me smiles, nodding in understanding.

In that moment, surrounded by this beauty, I feel a profound sense of love and connection, not just with myself, but with all of creation. The dream world pulses with possibilities, inviting me to step into a new way of relating, a way that honors the unique and preciousness of each individual.

The dream begins to fade, the garden dissolving into swirls of color and light. But as I drift back towards wakefulness, I carry with me the profound wisdom of this revelation. Boundingries, I now know, are not obstacles to closeness, but the very groundwork upon which deep, authentic connections can grow.

I awaken with a smile on my face, ready to step into this new understanding in the world of the waking.
