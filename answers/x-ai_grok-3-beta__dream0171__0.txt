I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a grand, cavernous auditorium, the walls adorned with intricate golden filigree that glimmers under the soft, ethereal glow of a thousand flickering chandeliers. The air is thick with anticipation, a hushed murmur rippling through the crowd of influential decision-makers seated before me. Their faces are sharp and discerning, eyes like polished obsidian, glinting with expectation. I can feel the weight of their gaze pressing down on me, a tangible force that makes my pulse race and my palms slick with sweat. This is it—the career-defining presentation I’ve spent months preparing for, the moment that will either catapult me to unimaginable heights or drag me into the abyss of failure.

I step up to the podium, my polished shoes clicking against the dark marble floor, the sound echoing like a drumroll heralding my fate. My materials are neatly arranged before me, a stack of glossy charts and meticulously crafted slides that I’ve pored over until my vision blurred. But as I flip open the first page to rehearse my opening line, a cold dread slithers down my spine. The numbers—they’re wrong. Not just slightly off, but fundamentally, glaringly incorrect. My heart plummets as I scan the pages, each error leaping out like a jagged scar on what was supposed to be perfection. A graph showing skyrocketing profits now inexplicably dips into catastrophic losses. A key statistic, the bedrock of my argument, reads as an absurdity—did I really write that we sold negative units last quarter?

Panic surges through me, a tidal wave that threatens to drown my composure. I glance up at the audience, their expressions unchanged, but I can sense the ticking clock in their minds, the unspoken ultimatum to begin. My throat tightens as I fumble with the projector remote, praying the digital version of my slides might somehow be spared this calamity. But as the screen flickers to life, the errors are magnified in high definition, projected for all to see. A gasp escapes me, though it’s swallowed by the cavernous space, and I feel the weight of a thousand judgmental eyes boring into me. Whispers ripple through the crowd now, a chorus of doubt that crescendos into a suffocating hum.

Desperation claws at my chest, and I scramble for a solution. I could admit the mistake, throw myself at their mercy—but no, that would be career suicide. I could improvise, weave a narrative so compelling they overlook the flaws, but my mind is a chaotic storm, thoughts splintering like shattered glass. My mouth opens, but no sound emerges, and in that agonizing silence, the auditorium begins to shift. The golden walls shimmer and warp, melting like wax under an unseen flame, and the chandeliers above sway precariously, casting wild shadows that dance like specters across the crowd.

Suddenly, the floor beneath me trembles, and I realize with a jolt of surreal horror that the auditorium is transforming into something else entirely. The marble cracks and splits, revealing a yawning chasm of endless black, and from it rises a labyrinth of twisting, thorn-covered vines. The decision-makers remain seated, unmoved, their faces now unnervingly blank, as if carved from stone. A voice, deep and resonant, echoes from the void below: “Fix it, or fall.” My presentation  scatter into the air, pages fluttering like frightened birds, and I lunge to catch them, only to find each sheet blank, wiped clean of any trace of my work.

I’m spiraling now, the vines snaking around my ankles, pulling me toward the edge of the chasm. My heart thunders as I grasp for something—anything—to anchor myself. And then, in a blinding flash, inspiration strikes like lightning. I don’t need the slides. I don’t need the numbers. I have my voice, my passion, my story. I wrench free from the vines, ignoring the sharp sting of thorns piercing my skin, and I face the crowd with a newfound ferocity. Words pour from me, unscripted and raw, painting a vision so vivid that even the stone-faced audience leans forward, captivated. The chasm seals shut beneath me, the auditorium reforms, and the golden light intensifies, bathing me in its warmth.

But just as applause begins to thunder through the space, a sharp, jarring noise splits the dream apart. My eyes snap open, and I’m back in my bed, the alarm clock blaring mercilessly on the nightstand. My heart is still racing, my breath ragged, and I can’t shake the lingering sensation of those vines around my ankles or the weight of those obsidian eyes. Yet, as I sit up, wiping the sweat from my brow, a strange sense of triumph lingers. I faced the impossible in my dream—and somehow, I survived.
