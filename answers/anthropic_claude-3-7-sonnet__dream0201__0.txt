I am dreaming. I'm winding my way through ancient catacombs, where the air hangs heavy with centuries of silence. The stone walls around me are etched with forgotten symbols and faded hieroglyphs, their meanings lost to time. My fingers trace the cool, rough surfaces as I navigate the labyrinthine passages that seem to breathe with a life of their own.

The torch in my hand is my sole companion, its warm amber light casting long, dancing shadows that play tricks on my perception. The flame wavers slightly with each step, illuminating burial niches and ceremonial chambers that haven't felt human presence in millennia.

Then—a flicker. My torch sputters, momentarily plunging me into absolute darkness before returning with half its former strength. My heart pounds against my ribs as I quicken my pace, suddenly aware of my vulnerability. Another flicker, longer this time. The darkness seems to have substance, pressing against my skin like cold velvet.

With each failure of the light, the blackness grows more complete, more consuming. During one extended moment of darkness, I hear something—a whisper? A shuffle? The sound seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. When the light returns, weaker still, I'm certain the passageway has somehow changed, though I couldn't explain how.

The torch flickers again, and in that moment of darkness, I feel a shift in the air, a presence that wasn't there before. The flame returns, trembling, revealing nothing but empty corridor ahead—yet I'm certain I'm no longer alone. The darkness between flickers grows longer, more disorienting, as if time itself stretches in the absence of light.

My sense of direction unravels with each blackout. Am I going deeper or finding my way out? The walls seem to rearrange themselves in darkness. The torch fails again, and this time I feel something brush past me, soft as silk against my arm...
