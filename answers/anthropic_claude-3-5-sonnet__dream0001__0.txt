I am dreaming. I find myself standing on a shimmering street where the pavement seems to pulse with an iridescent glow, like mother-of-pearl catching sunlight. The city around me stretches impossibly tall, its buildings twisted into haunting geometric shapes that defy physics – some spiraling inward, others floating disconnected from the ground, their surfaces reflecting fragments of clouds and distorted rainbows.

As the weight of my upcoming meeting bears down on me, I notice my watch behaving strangely – the hands moving both clockwise and counterclockwise simultaneously, leaving trailing afterimages like cosmic brushstrokes. The city's inhabitants pass by, but their faces keep shifting and morphing: one moment human, the next transforming into abstract paintings, then dissolving into cascades of butterflies that scatter into the wind.

I begin to run, my feet sometimes touching the ground, sometimes floating inches above it. Each street sign I encounter is written in a language that seems familiar yet impossible to read – the letters rearranging themselves like playful creatures every time I try to focus on them. The air tastes like memories of childhood summers and the color blue.

In my pocket, my phone transforms into a small, singing bird made of stained glass, offering directions in riddles and musical notes. The urgency of my meeting grows stronger, manifesting as actual weight on my shoulders that spreads like flowering vines down my arms. Every door I pass ripples like water, and through their keyholes, I catch glimpses of alternate cities – one made entirely of books, another of dancing light.

The sky above keeps changing colors, cycling through shades that don't exist in the waking world, while distant clock towers chime in reverse, their sound visible as rings of golden light expanding outward through the air. I'm certain my destination lies just around the next corner, but each turn leads to increasingly impossible architecture, where staircases loop into infinity and windows look out onto different seasons simultaneously...
