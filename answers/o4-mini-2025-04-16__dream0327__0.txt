I am dreaming. I’m drifting through a boundless dusk, where the sky is painted in molten rose and violet, and every breath tastes of salt and warm earth. The ground beneath me ripples like liquid glass, each footstep sending soft waves radiating outward. Overhead, lantern-fire moths the size of my hand flutter in slow motion, their wings shimmering through a prism of hidden rainbows.  

I move toward a distant figure seated on a charred driftwood bench. As I draw near, the figure’s features blur into shifting tides of memory—half-familiar laugh lines, a smile fractured by doubt. It’s someone I care for deeply, yet I’ve recoiled from them lately, convinced they bore some quiet judgment. In this dream-scape, that conviction hovers between us like a smoky veil.  

Suddenly the veil tears. I’m flooded with a soft golden light that illuminates every secret corner of my heart. I realize now I’ve projected my own fears onto this person: imagined criticism where there was only concern, misread their steady kindness as condescension. The shadow of my assumption dissolves, and I see them clearly at last—eyes warm as honey, hands open in welcome.  

With this new awareness, I rise from the wavering bench and step into the light between us. The world shivers for a moment: the moths pause mid-air, the mirrored ground stutters like a heartbeat. Then the air fills with music—a low, humming chord that seems to pulse from our joined palms. We share a smile unburdened by uncertainty.  

In this moment, my voice finds a clarity I never knew I had. “I’m sorry,” I whisper, though the words echo like a promise. As I speak, the sky above fractures into bright fractals—delicate, blooming patterns that drift like petals on a breeze. Each fractal carries a memory of laughter we never shared, truths I muffled with fear. One by one, they blossom and drift away.  

The figure reaches out and lays a hand on my heart. It feels cool, steady, like buried treasure uncovered. Light surges through me, not scorching but gentle, as if the sun itself is reminding me that warmth can heal. All around us, the landscape responds—sea foam rises in luminescent spirals, dunes roll into soft hills carpeted with glowing flowers.  

We walk together now, side by side, across that mirrored shore. With each step, the old assumptions shrink and vanish beneath our footprints. I realize that love, like this dream-world tide, is meant to ebb and flow honestly, without the weight of unspoken fears.  

In the distance, a final moth—wings of pure white flame—drifts toward us. It settles on my shoulder, and I feel its gentle heartbeat echo my own. And then, with a breath that feels like the turning of the world, I wake—carrying within me the truth that understanding can transform even the faintest spark of doubt into a beacon of connection.
