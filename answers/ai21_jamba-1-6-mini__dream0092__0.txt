I am dreaming. In the dream, you are a watchmaker, crafting delicate timepieces with a precision so fine it feels like breathing life into the very fabric of time itself. Each gear is meticulously placed, each spring wound with the utmost care, and every movement calibrated to perfection. The room around you is dimly lit, with a single, flickering candle casting long, wavering shadows across the intricate tools and components you work with. The air is thick with the faint scent of oil and metal, and the soft tick-tock of an unfinished watch nearby serves as a rhythmic soundtrack to your focused concentration.

Suddenly, a draft disturbs the flame, and the shadows stretch and twist, threatening to obscure your vision. You feel a subtle but noticeable change in the air, a faint trembling beneath your fingertips, like the floor shifting beneath a sleeping giant. You pause, unsettled, and look around the room, noticing for the first time that the walls seem to shift and breathe as if they are alive. The shadows deepen and thicken, crawling across the walls and floor like living, smothering hands.

You glance back at the watch you were working on, only to find that its hands are moving of their own accord, ticking faster and faster until they blur into streaks of light. The sounds of its ticking crescendo into a deafening roar, filling the room and echoing in your mind. Panic starts to rise within you as you realize that you have no control over the process you hold so dearâ€”the outcomes are slipping beyond your grasp. The air becomes heavier, the shadows more oppressive, and your vision begins to blur as if you're being drawn into the very core of the timepiece.

In the dream, you remain in control.
