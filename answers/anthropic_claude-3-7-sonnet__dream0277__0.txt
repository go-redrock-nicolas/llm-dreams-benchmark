I am dreaming. The air around me feels thick with possibilities, shimmering like heat waves rising from sun-baked asphalt. I stand at the edge of a sprawling labyrinth made entirely of antique mirrors, each reflecting not my present self, but versions of me from different moments when I turned away from something that frightened me.

The entrance beckons with a peculiar gravitational pull. Though my instinct screams to retreat, to turn and flee toward the comforting darkness behind me, something deeper—perhaps wisdom buried beneath layers of habit—urges me forward.

As I step into the labyrinth, the first mirror shows me declining a speaking opportunity that could have advanced my career. In the reflection, I see not just my younger face twisted with anxiety, but also shadowy figures of the audience I would have touched, ideas that would have flourished.

Each turn reveals another moment: relationships abandoned before vulnerability could take root, creative projects abandoned at the first whisper of criticism, adventures never embarked upon because safety felt more crucial than growth.

The mirrors don't judge—they simply reveal with perfect clarity. At the labyrinth's center stands a door made of water, somehow vertical and solid yet flowing. Beyond it, I glimpse indistinct shapes of magnificent possibilities.

My reflection in the water-door is not afraid but radiant, extended hand waiting for mine. I realize the labyrinth isn't about shame but recognition—each avoided moment was a teacher attempting to guide me here, to this threshold of transformation.

I reach toward the water-door, my fingertips tingling as they meet my reflection's. As our hands connect, the door dissolves around my advancing body, cool and welcoming as I step through into beautiful uncertainty.
