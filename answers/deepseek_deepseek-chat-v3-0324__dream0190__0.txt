I am dreaming. ### **The Final Barrier**  

You stand at the edge of a vast, impossible thing—a **Wall of Broken Mirrors**, stretching endlessly into an sky drowned in twilight. Each shard reflects a different version of yourself: some triumphant, some weeping, some lost in shadow. All of them whisper at once, a chorus of might-have-beens, of fears and regrets that sting like smoke in your lungs.  

The air hums with static, charged with the weight of all the trials you've already survived—the labyrinth of shifting floors where gravity itself betrayed you, the forest of silver thorns that laced your skin with scars, the dark river where specters of doubt tried to drag you under. You outran them. You fought them. But *this*… this feels final.  

A voice—neither kind nor cruel, simply inevitable—echoes from the wall:  

***"You cannot pass."***  

The words are not just sound. They are law, etched into the fabric of the dream. And yet…  

You **press your hand against the glass.**  

A crack forms. The sound of splintering mirrors fills the world. The reflections twist, warp—some scream, some laugh—but one, just *one*, reaches back.  

And pulls you *through.*  

You wake—not with a gasp, but with the slow, sure knowledge that the greatest barriers were never outside you at all.
