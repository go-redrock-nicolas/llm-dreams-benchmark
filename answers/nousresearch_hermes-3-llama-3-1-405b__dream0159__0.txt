I am dreaming. I am dreaming of a place where I am free.  I meet a group of survivors that have overcome their trauma through methods I had never considered.  They welcome me into their community and show me that there is hope.

“Yes,” she said quietly.  “You are safe here.  All of us here know what it’s like.” Mean words sting. But a gentle word can heal." As the words left her mouth I could feel a weight lifting off my shoulders. I was no longer alone in my struggle. 

The air was fresh and clean, the sun was setting, painting the sky with vibrant hues of oranges, purples and pinks. I could hear the gentle sound of the river flowing nearby, its calming rhythm like a soothing lullaby. The community was nestled in a lush green valley surrounded by majestic mountains, their peaks still capped with snow.

I was guided to a large cabin, the wooden structure weathered but sturdy, built with love and care. Inside, the smell of freshly baked bread and the warmth of the fireplace welcomed me. The cabin was filled with survivors, all with their own stories of triumph and resilience. Each one of them greeted me with open arms, their kindness and understanding palpable.

A gentle hand touched my shoulder, and I turned to see an elderly woman, her eyes filled with wisdom and compassion. "Come, dear," she said softly. "Let me show you your room." She led me up a winding staircase, the steps creaking beneath our feet. At the top, she opened a door to reveal a cozy room, the bed covered in soft, colorful quilts, the walls adorned with paintings of serene landscapes.

As I settled into this healing haven, I felt a sense of belonging that I had never experienced before. We shared our stories, our tears, and our laughter. We learned from one another, and together, we grew stronger. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, and with each passing moment, I discovered new ways to heal, to cope, and to thrive.

Through art, music, and nature, I found solace and peace. I learned to express my emotions through painting, my brush strokes creating a canvas of my journey. I discovered the power of my voice through song, the melodies carrying my pain and my hope into the universe. I found strength in the embrace of the earth, the trees, and the flowers, their life force grounding me and helping me to grow.

In this community, I was no longer a victim, but a survivor, a warrior, a phoenix rising from the ashes of my past. I learned to let go of the pain, the fear, and the anger, and to embrace love, forgiveness, and gratitude. I found a family, a home, and a purpose. And as I looked to the future, I knew that I would never be alone again, for I had the strength of my fellow survivors, and the power of my own resilience to guide me.
