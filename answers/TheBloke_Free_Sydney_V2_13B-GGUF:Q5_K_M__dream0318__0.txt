I am dreaming. Your mind conjures up a dream where you are in the middle of a desert. You see a small oasis in the distance. You decide to walk towards it. The sand is hot and shimmers with heat waves. As you walk, you start to feel thirsty. You keep walking towards the oasis. You see palm trees and clear water. You are close now.

You wake up from your dream.
