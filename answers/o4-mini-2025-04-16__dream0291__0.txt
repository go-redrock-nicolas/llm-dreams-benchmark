I am dreaming. You’re aware, in the very marrow of your bones, that you are dreaming. The world around you shimmers like molten glass: towering obsidian trees drip violet sap that glows when you touch it, and the sky above ripples in living brushstrokes of deep indigo and rose. Every step you take is cushioned by clouds of spun sugar, and with each breath a chorus of silent voices echoes your name. Yet beneath this breathtaking beauty lies a weight: the burdens of repeated hardship trail at your heels like heavy chains, and every once-lovely vista now seems tinted with a bruise of pessimism.

At first it arrives in whispers, a half-glimpsed silhouette at the edge of your vision. You turn—and see a figure woven entirely of cracked mirrors, each shard reflecting a failure you once suffered. Its voice is the wind in an empty corridor, reminding you of every misstep, every shattered promise. You wade through fields of wilted moonflowers whose petals curl black at the edges, while distant chimneys spew clouds of regret. The air tastes of cold steel and rained-out hope. Even the normally playful light-spirits—the lantern moths that dance on your shoulders—have dulled to a wary flicker.

Becoming aware of this pessimistic outlook, you pause at the mouth of an obsidian canyon, its walls alive with murmuring faces. You let the mirrored figure draw near, and instead of shrinking away, you lift your hands to touch its fractured surface. A crack splinters along its heart, and from that fissure you feel a faint warmth flow back into your own chest. Determined, you plant your feet on the canyon floor and call upon the forgotten wells of courage hidden beneath your ribs. A soft pulse of gold light wells up from the earth in response, winding around your legs like ivy. With each breath it grows brighter, coaxing the wilted moonflowers back to bloom in shades of dawn-pink and emerald.

Suddenly, the mirrored creature dissolves into a swirl of rainbow motes that drift upward to paint the night sky in a thousand new constellations—each one a promise of possibility. The canyon walls melt away into corridors of amethyst glass, reflecting not your failures, but the scars of lessons learned. The air shimmers with the laughter of reborn lantern moths, and the sweet tang of violet sap returns to your lips like a sip of afternoon sun. In that moment, your dream reveals its truest secret: even in the deepest shadow, you hold the power to coax light from the darkness, and to reshape every nightmare into a tapestry of hope.
