I am dreaming. I find myself suddenly transported to a society nestled within towering crystalline structures that reflect prisms of colors I've never before witnessed—colors that exist between the ones I know, with names like "mrilith" and "sovande" that somehow I understand despite never having heard them before. 

The people here move in fluid synchronicity, their relationships not defined by family lines or romantic connections, but by something they call "soul resonance patterns." Upon my arrival, I'm adorned with a delicate webbing of luminescent threads that connect to seven different individuals, marking me as part of their "resonance chord." This adoption happens without ceremony or explanation—simply an acknowledgment that our spiritual frequencies harmonize in ways predetermined by cosmic mathematics.

My primary connector, an elder named Thalestin whose skin shifts hues according to emotional weather patterns, explains that I must learn to share dreams with my chord members each night. This intimate practice—called "veillance"—replaces conversation as their primary communication. Refusing to share one's dreams is considered the deepest betrayal, while accidentally connecting with someone outside your chord is taboo, yet secretly practiced by rebellious youth.

I struggle desperately to understand boundaries that don't exist in forms I recognize. Personal possessions flow freely among chord members, yet intangible things—memories, specific emotional experiences, private thoughts about the color sovande—are guarded with elaborate social rituals involving musical tones and precise finger positions.

As days pass, I discover that reproduction happens not through physical means but through concentrated dream-sharing among three specific chord positions during celestial alignments. Children belong simultaneously to everyone and no one—raised communally but spiritually anchored to particular chord members who may live in entirely different settlements.

The most confounding aspect is their concept of love—not directed toward individuals but toward specific ephemeral moments shared between chord members. They collect these moments like precious stones, storing them in crystal vials worn around their necks, revisiting them during meditation cycles.

Just as I begin to grasp these alien dynamics, feeling the first genuine connections forming along my luminescent threads, the dream begins to slip away, the crystalline towers dissolving into morning light...
