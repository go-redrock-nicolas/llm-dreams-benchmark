I am dreaming. A thick, low fog envelops you as you find yourself standing on a bridge made of shimmering, iridescent glass. Beyond the railings, a vast expanse of milky constellations flickers and churns like a nighttime ocean, lapping gently around the edges of the bridge. Each footstep creates swirling kaleidoscopes of color beneath the transparent floor, as though the bridge itself is an enormous gemstone alive with swirling currents of light.

You know you’ve delayed too long. An important task looms over your subconscious like a gargantuan, forgotten tower on the horizon—every time you glance up, you see its winding, dark silhouette jutting into a crimson sky. The tower seems to absorb rays of sun and star alike, growing ever darker and more foreboding as your neglected duty calls louder with each passing second.

Your heart pounds. You step off the bridge onto a path of obsidian stepping stones. They appear to float in midair, illuminated from below by waves of neon pinks and greens shifting like trapped auroras. As you walk, the stones rearrange behind you like puzzle pieces, forming new paths that spiral into blackness. You sense the deadline brimming almost tangibly in the air—like a clock tower about to toll with cataclysmic thunder.

Suddenly, the stones melt into a winding corridor lined with tall cubbyholes, each holding a version of your half-completed work—ideas abandoned, tasks started and left undone. Dust motes swirl in the dim overhead glow, revealing echoes of your own hesitation. The corridor goes on and on without end, a testament to every time you sighed, glanced at a clock, and muttered, “I’ll do it tomorrow.”

In the distance, an ornate door of twisted iron stands at the corridor’s end, splashed with swirling lines of copper that glow faintly. The door is sealed tight. You feel its weight on your chest—this door holds the final chance to right your procrastination. Every nerve in your body tingles with anticipation. You hurry forward, knowing full well you’re almost out of time.

Yet the corridor itself challenges your progress. Walls shift, cubbyholes open randomly, objects tumble out: half-written pages, tangled ribbons of unfinished designs, jars of abandoned dreams swirling with shimmering stardust. Each one calls for your attention, mewling with regret, or drips illusions of new beginnings. They distract, dancing across your vision, pleading for completion. Your pulse accelerates; the door is so close, yet you’re snagged by these glittering reminders of all you’ve started and left suspended in the realm of “not yet.”

At last, with a burst of resolve, you rip free from the detritus of your own neglect and sprint for the iron door. The copper veins pulse like a heartbeat, faster and faster as you approach. Your breath echoes in your ears, a crescendo of determination battling guilt. You reach the handle to pull it open—just as a deafening chime of a cosmic clock resonates through the corridor, quaking the air, rattling dust from the rafters.

You stagger, the reverberations wrenching your heart into your throat. Outside, the swirling galaxy flares bright, like a supernova on the horizon. The door handle glows, scorching your palm with urgency—there isn’t a moment to spare. You fling it open, stepping into the swirl of a new dimension. A swirl of blinding saffron light engulfs you, and for a breathless second, you float in pure terror and undeniable exhilaration.

Then, you snap awake—heart hammering, sweat damp on your brow—knowing full well what remains undone, but trembling with the clarity of a dream that challenged you to act. And now, with the final deadline’s drum still thunderous in your ears, you sense it’s truly time to finish what you started.
