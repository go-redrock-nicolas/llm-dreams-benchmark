I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

The world around you has become a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors and surreal landscapes that shift and morph with the ebb and flow of your thoughts. Every step you take feels like wading through a dense, fragrant fog, and the ground beneath your feet pulses with an ethereal glow. Off in the distance, you hear the faint, haunting melody of a l waited you, the dream itself responds to your innermost desires.
