I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast crystalline lake, its surface mirroring a sky painted with impossible colors—violets that pulse like heartbeats, blues deeper than memory, and oranges that seem to whisper ancient secrets. The realization washes over me like the gentle lapping waves at my feet: I have been clutching tightly to moments and opportunities, hoarding experiences like a miser with coins, despite being surrounded by endless possibility.

As this awareness blossoms, the landscape begins to transform. The trees along the shoreline—once ordinary—now bear fruit made of translucent gemstones that catch the light of twin suns overhead. I reach upward and, instead of plucking just one fruit as I would have before, I open my arms wide. Dozens cascade down around me, each containing miniature worlds within—cities of light, mountains of song, oceans of memories not yet made.

The ground beneath my feet shifts from sand to a mosaic of living tiles, each one reflecting a different version of myself—some paths taken, others abandoned out of fear or doubt. I recognize now how I've been creating artificial boundaries in a boundless universe.

I wade into the lake, and as the waters rise around me, they don't feel wet but rather like liquid possibility soaking into my skin. Fish made of flowing calligraphy swim between my fingers, spelling out messages I somehow understand without reading: "The universe expands to match your vision of it."

The sky above cracks open like an eggshell, revealing not emptiness but infinite layers of reality stacked upon one another. I breathe deeply, and with each breath, I feel my chest expanding beyond its physical limits, becoming spacious enough to hold galaxies.

In this moment of cosmic clarity, I understand that abundance isn't about possession but permission—permission to exist fully, to extend beyond the artificial boundaries of my own making. The stars above rearrange themselves into a single word that both is and isn't a word, more a feeling given form: "Continue."

And so I do.
