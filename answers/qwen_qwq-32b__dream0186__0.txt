I am dreaming. I’m in a vast, empty realm where the sky is cracked like porcelain, reflecting fractured pieces of countless constellations. My hands glow faintly, emitting a soft azure light, and when I look down, I see that I’m standing on a bridge made entirely of glass. Beneath it isn’t water but a swirling vortex of memories—moments I’ve cherished, moments I’ve buried, all twisting and colliding like celestial bodies.

A voice echoes, not from outside, but from somewhere deep within my mind. It’s both my own and not mine, speaking in riddles woven with threads of sorrow and triumph. “You’ve built a labyrinth of mirrors,” it says, “each shard a secret you’ve never dared to name.” The glass beneath my feet begins to ripple as if alive. I try to run, but my legs move in slow motion, like wading through syrup thicker than time.

Suddenly, the bridge starts dissolving. The void below swallows sections of the glass, forcing me to leap between floating debris. Each fragment I land on shows me a different version of myself: one weeping beneath a willow tree, another laughing atop a mountain, another still, older and wiser, clutching an ancient book with pages.

I reach out to touch the images, but my hands pass through them, leaving trails of stardust. The voice returns, softer now, almost pleading. “The fractures are not weaknesses. They’re entryways.” I hesitate, then plunge my hand into the nearest memory-vortex below. Cold grasps me, gripping like the hands of forgotten lovers. Visions flood my mind—moments of vulnerability I’d buried: the time I sang too loudly and cracked, the confession I never sent, the friend I lost to silence.

As the memories surface, the void beneath begins to illuminate, transforming into a kaleidoscope of light. The bridge solidifies, now lined with mirrors polished to a shine. My reflection multiplies endlessly, each version of me holding a different emotion—a mosaic of joy, doubt, courage, regret. I finally understand the voice’s meaning. The labyrinth isn’t a cage; it’s a symphony of all I am.

Then I wake, my sheets tangled like the threads of my dreams. My hands still tingling with starlight, I whisper the unsaid words to the empty room, feeling the weight of buried truths finally begin to lift.
