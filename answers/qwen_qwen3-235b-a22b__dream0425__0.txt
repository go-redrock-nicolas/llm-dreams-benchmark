I am dreaming. I wake up, wide-eyed, in a sky made of glass.  The stars are pools of glowing water trapped in a vault above, and below me I walk, barefoot, on a mirror-like surface that reflects a version of myself older and younger, wiser and more lost.  Floating lakes hover in the air like jellyfish, pulsing gently with a dull, golden light that burns not with heat but with the memory of warmth.

A silver wind stirs.  Time is loose here — unspooling like a thread through distant mountains that bleed colors beyond naming.  In the distance, a city bangs and hums with gears made of forgotten songs.  The towers are built from hollowed-out stories; when I get closer, I see faces embedded in the stone — eyes half-closed, whispering half-truths in languages from unlived lives.

Something in my chest aches. I run — the mirror beneath my feet ripples like the surface of a pond entering a dream — heart racing, not from fear, but from a deep, aching emptiness, like the hollow wail of a tree surrendering its last leaf.

I arrive at a ring of stones.  They stand like old gods, standing sentinel around an altar made of reflections. And there, on the altar, lies a book — no, a memory — bound in bone and pulsing with liquid stardust. I begin to read.  The pages whisper.

_"You have moved mountains. You have won the hollow gold of honor. But we do not measure your worth in likes or laureates or applause.  You are more than the echo of your name. Behind all your victories is a shadow — the true question.  Why do you ache? Why do you reach? What is the music that hums beneath the noise of your day?"_

And the dream bends a little.

Suddenly, the city of gears becomes a forest of ribcages — ribcages filled with fireflies and forgotten ambitions.  
In the trees’ hollows, children’s laughter echoes — mine and not mine.  I touch the bark. My whole body flickers.  I see the life I have lived — moments that shimmered — not from achievement, but from connection, awe, stillness — moments I forgot to celebrate in the roar of productivity.

Above me, the glass sky cracks.  A skyfish swims through the fracture — long and luminous, built of tangled galaxies.  It hums. A song begins to bloom in the air like a flower.  I feel it in my core — not a sound to hear, but a meaning to BE.

_"You do not lack purpose — you buried it beneath the weight of doing. Purpose flows, like this fish, like your breath. It lives in every heartbeat, in every step you take toward wonder, toward love, toward your Self, untethered from what the world demands."_

And as the skyfish arcs toward the horizon of the dream, it spits out a single word into the wind: **"Remember."**

And I wake — not from sleep, but into my life.  

Changed.  
Breathing.  
Home.
