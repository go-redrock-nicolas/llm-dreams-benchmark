I am dreaming. …I draw in a breath that tastes like cold starlight and find myself standing on the deck of an impossible vessel—a ship made of paper-thin crystal, floating not on water but on a lake of rippling ink that reflects constellations I have never read about in any astronomy text. Each lapping wave hums in a different musical key, so when the wind brushes the surface it plays a shifting symphony.

I look down at my hands and discover a quill in my right palm and a compass in my left. Neither tool feels unfamiliar; somehow I know exactly how to wield them, though moments earlier—before sleep—they were strangers to me. The compass needle spins, pausing only when I let ideas bloom in my mind. If I think of mathematics, it points to an unfurling aurora on the horizon, as though geometric truths are stored in that glow. If I ponder medicine, it veers toward a distant archipelago of floating glass amphitheaters. In this dream, knowledge has become geography.

A hush falls over the crystalline deck as figures materialize from swirling parchment mist—cartographers dressed in robes that pulse with living topographical lines, librarians whose shawls are woven from tiny illuminated letters. They regard me with a mixture of reverence and relief.

“The Atlas is fracturing,” the chief cartographer says, his voice echoing like a note inside a wineglass. “Only the Keeper of Forgotten Coordinates can redraw the world before sunrise.”

Keeper of Forgotten Coordinates—that’s me, apparently. And though it should feel absurd, the title rests on my shoulders like a cloak made to measure. Instinct guides my fingers; I dip the quill into the lake of ink, and the surface accepts it like a cosmic inkwell. I start to sketch in midair, and lines of molten silver unfurl from the nib, shaping themselves into coastlines, river deltas, uncharted mountain ranges.

As I work, I realize I have gained an intimacy with disciplines I never studied. When a librarian asks how to stabilize a collapsing chronicle tower, I outline an architectural solution based on resonant frequencies that balance narrative tension—an impossible melding of acoustics, engineering, and literary theory. When a navigator frets over a star whose light has begun stuttering like a faulty lantern, I calmly enumerate spectral bandage techniques: weaving photonic threads to stitch celestial ruptures. Every answer flows forth as though I were recalling memories rather than inventing them.

But a low tremor rattles the deck: the ink-lake convulses, sending up black droplets that freeze midair into small, sharp punctuation marks—ellipses, commas, question marks—suspended like hesitant snow. Time is unspooling. The cartographers glance at me, their maps flickering between being and non-being.

I close my eyes and reach further inward, past the well of new talents, into a place of absolute stillness. There, I sense a luminous equation: curiosity plus compassion equals creation. I exhale, and the punctuation snow melts into soft syllables that spiral around my crystalline ship. The ink-lake calms. The compass needle settles—a steady glow pointing directly at my heart.

When I open my eyes, the newly drawn continents glimmer over the waves, perfectly aligned with the cosmos above. The librarians sigh with satisfaction; the cartographers bow. I lift the quill in a small salute, feeling both exhilarated and oddly homesick.

Then dawn sears the horizon—a ribbon of molten gold. The world I have redrawn dissolves like sugar in hot tea. The crystalline planks under my feet turn to sunlight, and the ship itself becomes a flock of glass-winged birds. They scatter, their wingtips leaving glittering trails.

I wake in my own bed, the morning light ordinary and plain. Yet a faint smear of starlit ink still stains my fingers, and somewhere in the back of my mind a compass needle glows, pointing toward whatever knowledge I’ll need next—should anyone, in dream or waking life, call on me again as the Keeper of Forgotten Coordinates.
