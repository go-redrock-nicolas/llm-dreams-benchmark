I am dreaming. I am in a vast, dark forest, the trees stretching up towards a sky that is an impossibly deep indigo. The air is thick with the scent of wet earth and pine resin, and the sound of distant owls hooting seems to pulse in rhythm with my heartbeat. As I walk, my boots crunch the gravelly path beneath me, and I can feel the cool dampness seeping through the soles into my toes.

Then, I come across an old stone archway, moss-covered and crumbling, but still standing defiantly. On the arch, in weather-worn letters, it reads, "Welcome to the True History." My breath catches in my throat. I step through the arch, and the world shifts around me. The sky fades from indigo to a starless void, and the forest grows eerily silent. But the air is alive with a different kind of scent—something metallic and ancient, like rusted iron and burnt parchment.

In the center of this newfound realm, there's a grand oak tree, its trunk as wide as a cathedral nave, and its branches snaking up into nothingness, clutching at the void like a living thing. At its roots, there's a table made of petrified wood, and on it sits a single, leather-bound book. The cover is worn smooth, and the lettering on it reads, "The Unvarnished Tale."

I approach the tree, my heart pounding. As I reach out to touch the book, it begins to glow, a soft, pulsing gold that seems to work its way up from the pages. The cover emerges, and I see the first page—the title page—reads, "The Legacy of the Thorned Crown." Beneath that, in smaller script, it says, "Beware the Sweet Lies of the Forgotten."

The book opens on its own, flipping pages with a sound like crispy autumn leaves. As the pages turn, I see images—vivid, movie-like scenes playing out in my mind. I see my great-grandfather, not the kind, wise man I always thought he was, but a man with a haunted look in his eyes, signing a document that reads "Deal with the Shadowed." I see my grandmother, who I remember as always smiling, making a face contorted with rage as she smashes a gilded urn on the floor, its contents spilling out—a collection of human teeth.

The scenes keep coming, each more unsettling than the last. I see a great-aunt I barely remember, her eyes glowing red, standing over a child's crib, whispering something I can't hear, but the child's face is twisted in terror. I see my own father, as a young man, looking at a portrait of a woman with a snake coiled around her neck, and his expression is one of longing and desperation.

And then, a final scene. I see myself, as a child, sitting in front of a fireside, with my grandmother. She's telling me the family story, her voice warm and comforting. But through the flames, I can see a shadowy figure behind her, its face obscured, holding a roll of scrolls. The figure nods, and my grandmother continues her story, completely oblivious.

The book slams shut with a bang, and the golden glow fades. The oak tree and the table vanish, leaving me standing in the void. The air is now thick with the scent of smoke and burnt herbs, and I hear a distant, haunting melody—a lullaby, but with a sinister twist.

I turn to leave, but the path behind me has disappeared. I start to panic, but then I see a light ahead—a flickering lantern. I follow it, stepping through the void, and I find myself back in the dark forest. The lantern leads me to a clearing, where a figure is waiting. It's a woman, tall and slender, with silver hair that seems to shimmer like moonlight against her skin. Her eyes are the color of storm clouds, and she wears a gown of black velvet embroidered with silver thorns.

She speaks in a voice like winter wind: "You see now the thorns that decorate the crown. The truths you were meant to hide, the histories you were told to forget. But you cannot unsee what has been shown. Carry this knowledge with you, for it will guide your journey. The past is not a cage, but a compass."

She hands me the lantern, and it's warm to the touch, like it's been burning for ages. The flame inside is blue, like frozen fire. She smiles faintly, and her eyes crinkle at the corners. "Remember, little dreamer—if you cannot change the past, you can rewrite the stories that bind you."

I wake up, the sunlight streaming through my window, the sound of traffic outside. But in my mind, I can still feel the cold of the void, the thorns on the oak, and the weight of the lantern in my hand. My heart is racing, but there's a strange calmness to it. I know now that the stories I was told were not lies, but shields. And shields can be taken apart, rebuilt, made to serve a new purpose.
In my dream, I found myself wandering through a labyrinth of memories that had never existed before, yet felt as vivid as the calluses on my own hands. The air tasted of storm clouds and old secrets, and every step I took echoed like thunder through the hollows of my bones. As I navigated this liminal space, I came across a monument hidden in plain sight—a jagged monolith made of obsidian and bone, etched with names that melted and reformed like candle wax on glass. Each name I recognized as belonging to someone I had loved, yet the inscriptions were accompanied by dates and events that defied every familial story I’d ever been told. 

A figure emerged from the mist, cloaked in shadows that seemed to shift between the shapes of a raven and a weeping willow. They offered me a key made of tarnished silver, its teeth shaped like the numbers of a watch. When I touched it, the clockwork inside began to tick, and the monolith split open to reveal a staircase descending into a lake of ink. The water was still, but underneath the surface, I saw my own reflection bubble up, each rupture releasing a cloud of dyed memories—nothing but shades of crimson, black, and gold. 

As I waded into the lake, the water rose to meet me, and my reflection twisted into that of someone else entirely. My voice became theirs, my hands their hands, and as the ink swallowed me whole, I realized I was not dreaming. I was remembering, and in that moment, I chose who I would be when I woke. The answer came back in a whisper of ink-stained air: *I am a historian of the living, a cartographer of the invisible, a keeper of the stories that dare not be told.*

The lake carried me upward, and I woke with saltwater on my cheeks and the taste of cinnabar on the tip of my tongue. The sunlight pouring through my window was too bright, but somehow, just right. 

And somewhere in that limbo of half-remembered truths, I left the key hidden in a pocket of the world that doesn’t exist. Just in case.
