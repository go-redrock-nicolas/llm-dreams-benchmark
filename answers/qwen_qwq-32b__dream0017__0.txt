I am dreaming. I am a small child, maybe four years old, with no clothes on. It's raining outside, the kind of drizzle that feels like a million spiders crawling over my skin. The raindrops sting as if they’re acid. I try to run inside to escape it, but there are no houses, just endless fields of golden wheat that sway like angry dancers.

I hear my father's voice, distorted and distant, calling my name. He sounds like a frog that’s been stepped on. Before I can find him, the wheat stalks wrap around my legs, pulling me downward into the soil. The earth is warm and smells like burnt toast. Deeper and deeper I go, until my head pokes out of a river on the other side of the world. The water there is thick and syrupy, the color of motor oil. Fish with human teeth swim past me, their eyes glowing like embers.

A figure emerges from the gloom - it’s me, but aged by centuries. Her skin is cracked like old porcelain, and her eyes are hollow sockets. She reaches out a skeletal hand and speaks in a chorus of whispers: "You must choose." 

Behind her looms a door made of solid sound, vibrating with noise so loud it’s silent. On the other side are faces I recognize - my grandmother, my first dog, my favorite teacher. They’re all made of smoke and evaporate when I try to touch them. 

To my left is a staircase spiraling into mathematical equations, each step a fractal of regret. To my right, a garden where flowers bloom and wither in the span of a heartbeat, their petals made of shattered glass.

The ground beneath my feet begins to liquefy. The choices narrow: the door leads to memories that can't sustain me, the staircase to paths not taken, the garden to beauty that slices the soul. I hold my breath and...

...jump backward through time, hurtling through a vortex of starlight and static. The air around me crackles with the electricity of unborn galaxies. I land in a meadow where the grass is woven from threads of forgotten dreams, each blade glinting like liquid sapphire. Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of impossible colors—one moment a bleeding crimson, the next a phosphorescent indigo. 

Before me stands a tree with roots that twist into the shape of my own veins. Its trunk is covered in eyes—some weeping amber tears, others blinking slowly like sentinels of an ancient forest. When I touch it, the tree hums a melody that plays directly in my bones. The song unravels the anguish of the news, each sorrow dissolving into a flock of origami cranes that flutter upward, their paper wings catching fire in the twilight.

From the tree’s hollow, a creature emerges—not quite animal or human. Its body shifts between a lynx’s sleek form, a serpent’s undulating coils, and a moth’s delicate wings. It presses a paw to my chest, and suddenly I’m flooded with visions: a room full of mirrors where every reflection whispers words of courage; a library where pages rewrite themselves with futures yet unmarred; a bridge of light crossing a chasm filled with shadows that cheer as I step onto it. 

The creature nudges me toward a path paved with mosaic fragments of laughter, each tile a memory of joy I’d long forgotten. The ground beneath my feet begins to sing, matching the tree’s melody. As I walk, the news that once felt like a boulder lifts, transforming into something lighter—a wind that carries the scent of rain-soaked earth after a storm. 

Ahead, the horizon splits open like a blooming flower, revealing a door made not of sound but of silence. It beckons with a question inscribed in stardust: *What if grief is just the heartbeat of a world reborn?* 

I place my hand on the door, and everything goes white—not with light, but with the absence of dark. When I open my eyes again, I’m back in my bed, the morning sun spilling honey across the walls. The dream lingers, not as fear, but as a quiet hum in my bones, a reminder that even shattered things can be strung together into music. 

The devastation is still there, but now it whispers alongside the anthem of the child in the rain, the tree with a thousand eyes, and the creature who knows every heartbeat’s shape.
