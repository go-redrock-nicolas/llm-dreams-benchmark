I am dreaming. I am lying down on my bed, closing my eyes and imagining all kinds of beautiful things that can make me happy.
But today, I have a bad feeling about this dream. Today, I feel scared and helpless. Today, I know what my greatest fear is.

It's being alone forever. It's losing everyone and everything that matters to me. It's living in darkness and silence where no one
can hear me or see me. It's facing the uncertainty of death without anyone to comfort me or guide me.

I don't want this dream to come true. I don't want to be separated from my family, friends, and colleagues. I don't want to lose my
memory, personality, and identity. I don't want to fade away into nothingness.

But sometimes, I wonder if this is what really awaits us all at the end of our lives. Sometimes, I fear that this is the ultimate
reality that no one can escape from.

Sometimes, I hope that there is something more beyond death than just oblivion and nonexistence.

Sometimes, I pray that God will save me from my own worst nightmare.

But for now, I must accept this dream as it is and try to find some meaning or purpose in it. Maybe by facing my fear head-on,
I can overcome it or at least learn how to deal with it better.
