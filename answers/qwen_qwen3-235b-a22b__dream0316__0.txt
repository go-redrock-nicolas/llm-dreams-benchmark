I am dreaming. A strange twilight glimmers all around, hung with the scent of old memories and the lump of loss like an anchor in the chest.

I am walking through a forest of glass bottles. Towers of them rise like broken skyscrapers, reflecting the wistful gray lilac sky above—each bottle holding something once cherished, something that once quenched or comforted or cleansed. This is the Realm of Rituals, formed long ago from my daily touch: the coffee I sipped at dawn, the shampoo that whispered through my hair like a lullaby of childhood, the snack I craved during study nights and late drives alike. 

At the heart of the forest, cradled in the curl of a silver root, sits a bottle with a label I’ve come to worship over years—my brand, our brand, the one that watched over me like a kindly aunt, always familiar, never misleading. It glows still, faintly, with that comforting light. Our symbol: an emblem of trust pinned on the chest of my heart years ago.

But when I reach for it, the bottle shivers.

Where once the liquid inside flowed golden and clear, there is now a dull, murky swirl, clouded and slow, like mud trying to masquerade as honey.

I pull it open. The scent wafts out—not home anymore—but something synthetic, faintly cloying, like cologne on a hot day in a crowded elevator. I taste a droplet on my tongue. It's bitter in a way that floors the memory of sweetness I’d stored there so safely.

And then the bottle speaks.

Not in a voice, but with a wrenching feeling, as though the bottle were asking me: *“Would you still love me, even if I changed?”*

My chest stings. On instinct, I clasp it to my breast—it is still warm from my years of affection—but I’m repelled now, just slightly. Not out of hatred, not exactly. Out of confusion, of that awful soft heartbreak of disappointment. This is not betrayal. Perhaps evolution? Or maybe it just melted into something easier, cheaper, brighter for the masses—while forgetting those of us who loved it quietly, faithfully, without headlines.

As I stumble backward, other paths uncover themselves. In the dim-lit shadows, other bottles sparkle with strange new labels. Competitors—glamorous and brash, foreign yet promising. I see a seductive cab with sleek packaging; a bold company formed in rebellion, with shocking flavor profiles and flair. Another glows with promises of purity, minimalist and shy but self-assured. Their bottles hum with something bright—clarity. Newness. Excitement.

But... there’s no nostalgia in them yet. No childhood laughter echoing from within. No memories of clumsy college mornings or late-night weeping after bad breakups where only that old company could soothe.

I stand there, between the crumbling shrine I loved and unknown altars I’m afraid to build for.

The question hovers in the dream air like a bell I must ring but don’t yet know where it leads:

**Can I trade loyalty for truth? Or am I holding onto a ghost that stopped paying attention to me long ago?**

The glass forest watches me, waiting for a choice that defines more than a purchase—perhaps a transformation.

I close my eyes… and wake before the answer arrives.
