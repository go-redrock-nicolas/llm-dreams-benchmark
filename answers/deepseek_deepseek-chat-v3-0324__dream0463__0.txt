I am dreaming. **Dream Journal: The Garden of Withheld Approval**  

I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of withering roses, their petals curling at the edges like burning parchment. I stand in an endless garden, its paths lined with mirrors that do not reflect me—instead, they show only the shifting faces of those whose approval I have spent lifetimes chasing. A father who never nods, a lover who only turns away, a mentor whose praise dissolves like mist the moment I reach for it. Their voices hum just beyond hearing, a taunting static that prickles my skin.  

Ahead, a door suspended in midair pulses like a heartbeat, its surface carved with the words *"Why do you keep returning here?"* I know this door—I’ve shouldered through it a thousand times, each exit leading me right back to the garden’s center. But tonight, something is different. The wind carries a new whisper: *"Look at your hands."*  

I raise them. Vines snake from my fingers, not trapping me but *rooting* me—to the earth, to myself. The mirrors crack. One by one, they shatter, and in their shards, I glimpse something unfamiliar: my own face, untwisted by longing. The garden begins to dissolve, not into darkness but into dawn.  

I wake just as the first light sears through the dream’s fabric, clutching a single, radiant truth: *I am the only one who can water this ache—or let it wither.*  

(How does the dream linger in your bones as you stir awake?)
