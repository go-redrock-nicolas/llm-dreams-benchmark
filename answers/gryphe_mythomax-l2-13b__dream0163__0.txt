I am dreaming. In the dream, I am transported to a vast crystal cathedral, bathed in an otherworldly glow. Upon the center altar rests a mystical orb of shimmering colors. As I approach, it pulsates with an energy that resonates deep within my core.

A hooded figure appears before me, their voice deep and resonant. "Welcome, dreamer. You have been chosen to solve a centuries-old problem. One that has plagued humanity since its inception."

He then presents me with a riddle. "What is always in front of you but can't be seen? What is broken but never falls apart? What's endlessly deep yet contains no water?"

I ponder the enigma, my mind whirling with possibilities. Suddenly, a light bulb switches on in my head, illuminating the answer.

"The solution is staring us right in the face," I exclaim. "The answer lies in manipulating light itself."

I conjure up images of a device capable of transmuting physical matter by harnessing the power of light. A device so advanced it could potentially solve our world's most pressing issues.

As I sketch out the blueprints for this marvel, the cathedral begins to shift around me. The walls reflect prisms of rainbow colors, morphing into intricate patterns that dance before my eyes.

"How do you know all of this?" asks a voice. It's the hooded figure, stripped of their cloak revealing a familiar face. It's myself, but older, wiser. "You're dreaming, after all."

The dream fades as I wake up, my mind buzzing with possibilities. Did I just solve the problem we've been grappling with for ages? Only time will tell.
