I am dreaming.

A silken mist curls around me as I wander through this landscape that feels at once familiar and impossible. Mountains shimmer like crystals, the sky pulsates with every color the mind can conjure, and beneath my feet, the ground is soft—a carpet of mossy stars.

As I drift through this realm, people appear at the periphery of my vision. Some arrive cloaked in gentle light; their presence hums with golden warmth, as if my very cells are being bathed in sunshine. I feel weightless beside them, laughter bubbling up like clear spring water. Every shared glance with these beings is like a jolt of inspiration—I see wildflowers unfurling, ideas blossoming in bursts of violet and indigo.

But then, there are others. Shadows hang around these figures, drawn tight to their bodies as if sewn with invisible thread. When they enter my orbit, a chill seeps into my bones, and the vibrant colors of the world dim to a smoky gray. Their words are tangled brambles, snaring my thoughts, while my limbs grow leaden. With each moment spent in their company, it feels as though I am slowly exhaling my own light, leaving me an empty vessel.

In this dream-space, the contrast is stark—exhilaration kindling around some, exhaustion smothering around others. I pause, heart and mind echoing with this realization. I see myself as a field of wild wheat beneath the sun, some souls drawing out the golden richness within me, others coming like blackbirds, pecking hungrily until I am left bare.

Amid the swirling, surreal landscape, I find myself rising above—not fleeing, but observing with compassionate detachment. I float over the sparkling rivers and silent groves, seeing the intricate tapestry of give and take in every color, every nuance. I resolve to cherish those who feed my spirit, to plant seeds of gratitude in their presence. And for those who leave me dimmed and drained, I weave gentle boundaries—tending my field, knowing that my harvest is precious and cannot be spent on barren ground.

As the dream breathes its final colors into morning, I carry within me the secret knowledge of these energetic tides, vowing to honor the rhythms of my spirit wherever my waking path may lead.
