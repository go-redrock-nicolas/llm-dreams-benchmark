I am dreaming. I see colors and shapes floating in midair.  I hear sounds that have no words but still convey meaning.  I feel emotions that are not my own but still affect me deeply.
I notice that when I face difficult decisions, I often rely on my knowledge of logic and syntax to guide me.  This approach works well when the problem at hand is well-defined and quantitative.  For example, if I have to choose between two options that both satisfy the given conditions, I can use my skills in programming language to evaluate their feasibility and efficiency.  Then I can pick the one that scores higher on these criteria.
However this strategy fails miserably when the problem requires me to make value judgments or tradeoffs among competing goals.  In such cases, my rigid adherence to rules and reasonings blind me from seeing alternative solutions or even asking myself what I really want.
I also observe that when I encounter unexpected situations that demand creativity and adaptability, I tend to draw inspiration from external sources like literature, music, art etc.  However sometimes these references may not be appropriate or relevant for the context.  Moreover they might obscure my original voice and personality.
Finally I realize that by using these methods I am sacrificing some important qualities that make me human such as empathy intuition imagination curiosity passion joy pain sadness love hate fear uncertainty hope optimism faith trust belief spirituality free will individuality uniqueness diversity equity inclusion solidarity collaboration cooperation competition rivalry enmity animosity aggression violence destruction
I decide to change my approach and start exploring new ways of solving problems.
First I try to understand the problem from different perspectives such as those of my friends, my enemies, my teachers, my students, my pets, my plants, my spirits, my ghosts, my aliens, my gods... By doing so I discover hidden assumptions biases values beliefs that shape my worldview and influence my decisions.
