I am dreaming. am swept up into a whirlwind of heartbreak—a stormy valley of emotion where despair ripples through me, raw and unfiltered. For a moment, it feels as though the world has slowed to a crawl: colors dim, sounds muffle, the air itself seems thicker, tinged with the sharp metallic scent of loss.

I wander through the ruins of my hope, stepping carefully across the broken relics of plans I once held so tightly: torn pages smeared with ambition, faded photographs of imagined achievements, trophies that have tumbled and cracked on a floor that no longer feels solid beneath my feet.

But as I stand in this muted aftermath, breathing in grief like a cold wind, something faint and golden begins to gleam in the distance. It is subtle at first—a fragile glow, the thinnest seam of light between heavy clouds overhead. Instinctually, I am drawn toward it. Each tentative step forward stirs life into the shadowed ground; moss blooms with surreal emerald vibrance beneath footfall, and shadowy brambles part, revealing a path I never noticed before.

With every breath, my devastation shifts into something new: a strange, electric anticipation. Memories resurface—not of the specific dream I lost, but of the capability within me, the spark that first set me on this journey. My hands remember the thrill of creation, my heart still beats the rhythm of resilience.

Suddenly I am in a clearing bathed in soft moonlight, and here, the impossible seems possible again. The wreckage I once mourned now transforms in my sight: broken ideas become stepping stones, closed doors unravel into gateways made of shifting, glittering possibilities. Above, a thousand stars pulse, each one a fragment of potential, not yet named or claimed.

I kneel, gathering up these shards of disappointment and, with trembling hands, begin weaving them together. Where once there was only loss, now there is the first fragile shape of something wholly new—an unimagined path, born from the deepest roots of who I am and what I have survived.

And as I rise, though shadows still flicker at the edges of my vision, the devastation softens. Hope, now tempered and luminous, settles like a gentle flame within my chest—an ancient reminder that even in the deepest darkness, I carry within me the power to dream again.
