I am dreaming. The world shifts around me as I stand in my childhood home, but something is subtly wrong—the pictures on the walls show faces I recognize as my family, yet they seem to flicker between familiar and foreign when I'm not looking directly at them. My fingers trace the edge of a photo album I don't remember opening, its leather cover worn in unfamiliar patterns beneath my fingertips.

A letter falls from between yellowed pages—handwriting I've never seen before signed with my grandmother's name. As I read, the walls of the house seem to breathe inward, the air growing thick with unspoken histories. The letter speaks of islands I've never heard of, of a family name changed at Ellis Island not for simplification but for escape, of bloodlines carefully obscured across generations.

I learn that the gentle family stories told at holidays were elaborate constructions—my ancestors were not the humble merchants of family lore but involved in something darker. The family wealth came not from ingenuity but exploitation. The frequent relocations were not for opportunity but necessity. Even my beloved grandmother's characteristic scar had an origin far from the cooking accident I'd been told about.

Standing there, I feel the ground beneath me remain solid despite this seismic shift in my understanding. The revelation doesn't shatter me as it might have—instead, I feel my mind expanding to hold both versions of my history: the comforting narrative crafted to protect me and the complex, troubled truth. The faces in the photos seem to watch me with a mixture of apology and relief.

The dream-light changes, casting long shadows across the floor as I carefully return the letter to the album, understanding now why certain questions were always deflected, why certain relatives were never mentioned, why certain places were avoided. Despite everything, I find myself filled with a strange compassion for those who constructed this protective fiction around my life—a shield made of stories, built from love as much as fear.
