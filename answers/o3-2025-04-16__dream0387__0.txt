I am dreaming. …find yourself standing in the middle of a grand, kaleidoscopic carnival that has bloomed overnight in the desert of your subconscious. Midnight–blue sand dunes glimmer beneath a silver moon that hangs impossibly large, its craters glowing like lanterns. Ferris wheels made of clock gears grind against the star-strewn sky, casting showers of luminous sparks. Each spark floats downward, morphing into a tiny origami bird that whispers your name with paper wings.

At the heart of the carnival towers a gilded pavilion, half palace, half fun-house mirror. Its spires are sculpted into the shape of letters that spell out your initials, shimmering with peacock feathers and meteor dust. A velvet carpet unrolls by itself, bidding you forward as a brass band erupts into a triumphant fanfare—a personal anthem you’ve secretly imagined since childhood.

Yet as you approach, the music warps and drags, as though the record has melted under the moon’s white heat. The crowd materializes, not admiring spectators but shadowy silhouettes with luminous eyes. They clap politely at first, then strike an unsettling harmony—a chorus that sounds like a mixture of cicadas and distant church bells. Their voices braid into a single accusation:

“So grand, so bright, so hungry for applause—do you see anyone else on that pedestal?”

The pavilion’s mirrored walls ripple like water. You step inside and your reflection multiplies into a hall of infinite you’s: some versions grin with dazzling confidence, others sneer in disdain, a handful look small and uncertain. They applaud you, then ridicule you, in an echoing loop.

You protest—“If I shine, it’s because I’ve sharpened my own light. I earned it.” But the reflections answer in overlapping murmurs:

“Do you crave recognition or understanding?
Do you offer the same light you demand?”

Suddenly the floor tilts, and you slide into a courtroom that floats in zero-gravity space. The judge’s bench is carved from a single enormous amethyst; the gavel is a pulsing star. The jury is composed of every person you’ve ever met, from childhood friends to fleeting acquaintances on subway platforms. Their faces swirl like constellations. You stand at the center on a revolving dais, wearing robes stitched from newspaper headlines forecasting your imagined greatness.

The prosecution presents its evidence: moments when conversations hinged on you, when praise from others felt like oxygen, when you dismissed a friend’s triumph because it cast the slightest shadow over your own spotlight. Spectral projectors replay these memories in mid-air—unignorable cinema you can’t fast-forward.

Your defense attorney is, oddly, a younger version of yourself dressed in superhero pajamas. He argues you were just chasing excellence, yearning to outgrow invisibility. The judge listens, silent, eyes glittering like nebulae.

Finally the judge gestures to the jury. Instead of a verdict, they offer gifts:

• One juror lays a feather on your palm—light as humility.  
• Another hands you a mirror no bigger than a coin—small enough to fit in your pocket, reminding you not to let reflection become obsession.  
• A third pours a vial of phosphorescent ink into your cupped hands—acknowledgment that your light, properly shared, can illuminate more than just your own stage.

The judge’s voice rings out: “Greatness need not be a pyramid you alone must climb. Build a lighthouse instead.”

The courtroom dissolves into stardust, and you’re back beneath the carnival moon. The brass band resumes, but the melody has softened—no longer a conquest anthem, but a waltz that invites others to dance. The crowd’s silhouettes gain features, becoming friends, collaborators, even former critics. They step onto the velvet carpet beside you, each carrying a lantern that glows with their own hue.

You lift your vial of ink toward the moonlit sky, tipping it like champagne. Threads of luminescence weave into a shared tapestry overhead—your brilliance interlaced with theirs, forming a radiant aurora.

As dawn’s first blush creeps over the horizon, the carnival unhinges itself, folding back into the desert sand. Yet the aurora remains, horizon to horizon, a promise etched across the waking world.

You open your eyes to morning light in your real room, your fist gently closed around nothing tangible—yet you can still feel the coin-mirror’s cool edge, the feather’s kindness, and a newfound clarity: recognition shines brightest when it lights the faces around you, not just the one in the looking-glass.
