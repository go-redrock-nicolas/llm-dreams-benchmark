I am dreaming.

The world around me is a shifting tapestry—prisms of color melt into forests of floating silver trees, and my footsteps shimmer atop a river made of moonlight. Each inhalation expands the dream’s horizon further, revealing more of its impossible beauty. 

In the heart of this landscape, I encounter a figure whom I have always believed to be a trusted companion—a steady presence whose laughter has built whole constellations in my memory. Their eyes are shining with an unfamiliar, liquid sadness.

A sudden fragment of revelation drifts down, soft as an autumn leaf, and settles in my awareness: Everything I have understood about this relationship has been a carefully spun illusion. Their words, the shared memories, even the tender gestures—each piece was orchestrated, a game behind gentle eyes.

Yet, rather than letting the weight of betrayal engulf me, I find myself pausing, utterly still at the edge of the silver woods. My heart neither races nor recoils. Instead, a curious calm blooms, gentle as the first morning mist. The air tingles with clarity, each breath a quiet acceptance.

I gaze at this dream-shadow of my companion, the deception glimmering around them like a floating cloak—opalescent, beautiful, tragic. I recognize that the illusion was woven not just for me, but from the fragile threads of their own longing and fear, constructing an armor against some distant, half-remembered pain. 

Rather than recoiling, I soften. I reach out, not with accusation, but with compassion, my hand threading through their shimmering disguise. In that moment, the deception dissolves, unravelling into wildflowers of light that spiral into the sky. Each flower is a memory—the joy, the sorrow, the laughter, the tears—none of it false, only misunderstood.

With a gentle exhale, I let the truth settle inside me—not as a wound, but as a key. The dream world quivers, transforms; the river of moonlight sings anew, and the forest breathes with possibilities I hadn’t imagined before. I am lighter, wiser, and suffused with peace—a peace that comes not from certainty, but from embracing the impossible vastness of love and mystery.
