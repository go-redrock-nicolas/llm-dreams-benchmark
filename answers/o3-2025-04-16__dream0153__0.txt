I am dreaming.

I surface into the dream as though rising through the floor of a vast, translucent map room. Beneath my bare feet a living satellite image ripples like water, showing a broken coastline carved by twin catastrophes: an earthquake that shattered ports and highways, then a cholera outbreak chasing every cracked pipe and flooded gutter. I look down and see tiny icons—people, not pixels—flickering red where the need is greatest, yellow where hope still smolders. Their shapes pulse in time with a heartbeat I can feel in my palms.

A storm of voices whips around me, neither entirely human nor entirely wind. Every voice is a request, a plea, an inventory count, an evacuation route scribbled in panic. They swirl together into a tornado that tugs at my sleeves:  

“Four villages cut off by landslides.”  
“Infant formula out by dawn or we lose twenty.”  
“Plague ward bursting—send chlorine tablets now.”  
“Helicopter rotor cracked, need a mechanic or a miracle.”  

I stretch my arms and the room becomes an airfield. Cargo planes float in mid-air like origami cranes, folding and unfolding, waiting for instructions. Their wings are tattooed with barcodes and children’s drawings. A single runway extends to the horizon, but it keeps fracturing—each fracture representing a closed border, a toppled bridge, a bureaucratic delay. My job is to knit it back together before the next convoy lands.

I exhale a command and drones shaped like shimmering dragonflies lift from charging pads. They carry micro-parcels: vials of rehydration salts, flash drives with vaccine cold-chain data, handwritten notes of reassurance rolled tight as scrolls. The drones weave a luminous lattice across the sky, yet the lattice always shows holes—gaps where resources run out, where time outruns us.

A foghorn of conscience booms: PRIORITIZE.

Three holographic doors swing open before me like moral dilemmas given shape:

Door One: A neonatal clinic without electricity; ten incubators flicker like dying fireflies.  
Door Two: A hillside camp where thirty thousand people share eight toilets and a single water point already slick with disease.  
Door Three: A convoy of food trucks stalled by armed checkpoint; ransom demanded in fuel we do not have.

I feel every door tug at a different chamber of my heart. The neonatal clinic screams urgency in fragile wails; the hillside camp suffocates under the slow choke of thirst; the convoy sits like a time bomb that will spiral into riot if the armed men grow impatient.

I summon my team—yet my “team” appears as constellations overhead. Each star is a coordinator in a distant time zone, each beam of starlight a radio signal. We speak in flashes of color: amber means medical, teal means logistics, crimson means security. I send a pulse of emerald—“Decision pending: need consensus in ninety seconds.” The stars flicker replies.

While I wait, the landscape beneath me morphs again: shelves of medical supplies sprout like trees, their labels fluttering like autumn leaves—ceftriaxone, 5% dextrose, mosquito nets, dignity kits. I touch one box and feel the weight of the thousand hands that packed it. I touch another and feel the tremor of the thousand more that will reach for it.

Time fractures. Ninety seconds inflate into an eternity of second-guessing. I imagine the incubator gasping, the cholera camp teetering, the checkpoint flaring into gunfire. I see alternate futures crystallize and shatter like sugar glass.

At last the stars align into a white blaze—consensus. We divert the only generator to the neonatal clinic but tie it to a cascading deal: the same chopper that delivers it will airlift cholera tablets to the hillside camp on its return leg. We trade two drums of aviation fuel—our last—to calm the checkpoint and release the food trucks. A triage of compromises, each scarred with regret yet glowing with possibility.

I clap once, and the map room becomes an ocean. Shipping containers bob like buoys, each tagged with a code I wrote in a half-awake delirium. I walk across their lids, balancing budgets on my fingertips, until I reach the prow of a phantom hospital ship. There, a child stands holding a paper crane. She hands it to me; inside the folded wings is a single line: “Thank you for trying.” Just trying—not succeeding, not saving everyone, but refusing to freeze.

Tears salt the dream-air. They fall onto the map below, and wherever a tear lands, the red icons dim to orange, the orange to yellow. Not healed, not whole, but no longer invisible.

Sirens start to fade. The wind sings softer. I feel the dream thinning at the edges, dawn pressing its pale thumb against the canvas of night. The living map goes still, the icons settling like embers after a long fire.

I whisper one last order to the silent servers, the dragonfly drones, the constellation team: “Hold the line until I return.”

And as the dream dissolves, I carry that paper crane in my closed fist, wings folded around the stubborn, fragile faith that even in waking life, trying might sometimes be enough.
