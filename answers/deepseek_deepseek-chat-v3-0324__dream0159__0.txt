I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of wild lavender and damp earth, the kind that clings to your skin like a forgotten whisper. Around me, a circle of figures stands in a clearing—where the gnarled roots of ancient oaks weave in and out of the ground like the veins of the earth itself. Their faces are an impossible mosaic—some flicker with shifting features, as if lit by unseen candlelight, while others bear scars that glow faintly, pulsing like starlight trapped beneath their skin.  

A woman with hair like spun silver and eyes that hold galaxies extends a hand. Her fingers are warm, not just with heat, but with something deeper—resonance, the kind that hums against your bones. *"You've been carrying it like a corpse on your back,"* she murmurs. Her voice isn’t just sound; it’s texture, like sinking into dark water without drowning.  

As I step forward, the ground shifts beneath me—not to shake me, but to cradle. The others begin moving in slow, deliberate patterns, their feet pressing into the soil, leaving behind tiny blossoms where their toes touch. A man with bark-like skin presses a hollowed gourd into my hands. Inside, liquid moonlight swirls, reacting to my breath. *"Drink what you’ve been afraid to name,"* he says.  

The drink is cold and electric. It doesn’t just slide down my throat—it unfolds inside me, a vine threading through my ribs, tendrils curling around the knots of old wounds. One by one, they loosen. Shadows I thought were permanent peel away, revealing raw but living flesh beneath, tender as dawn.  

The circle tightens. Hands press against my back, my shoulders, my temples. They don’t just touch me—they *remember* me. And suddenly, I am not being healed.  

I am remembering how to heal myself.  

Then, like a song fading into the wind, the dream wavers—but the resonance lingers, humming in the marrow. I wake with the taste of moonlight still on my tongue.
