I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of candle wax and old wood, the dim glow of flickering flames casting long, wavering shadows across the faces of the gathered mourners. A priest in dark robes speaks in slow, measured tones, his words meant to soothe—but instead, they settle upon me like a strange weight, pressing in an unexpected way.  

The coffin is polished oak, gleaming faintly in the muted light, resting atop a draped bier. The deceased—some distant relative, perhaps, or maybe no one I knew at all—lies in eternal repose, pale hands folded over their chest, face arranged into a careful serenity. Someone sniffles in the front row. A stifled sob. The gravity of the moment is undeniable.  

And yet—  

A sound bubbles up in my throat. I press my lips tight, clench my jaw, swallow it down. But the pressure does not fade. It swells, rising like a tide, an unstoppable force of absurdity. The more I resist, the more treacherous it becomes. The priest's slow, sonorous voice—has it always had that slight lisp? That odd cadence, like a man struggling not to hiccup mid-sentence? And does the portrait of the deceased above the altar... tilt slightly to the left? Just a little crooked?  

A muffled snort escapes me. I disguise it as a cough. Someone glances my way with concern. I nod solemnly, pressing my fist to my mouth. But inside, I am unraveling. The priest has begun a hymn now, his voice wavering off-key. Behind him, a motion in the stained-glass window—is that a bird perched on the shoulder of Saint Whoever, pecking at his halo? My stomach tightens with the effort of restraint.  

Then—disaster. The organist hits a wrong note with a comically flat *squawk*, and suddenly I see it all: the absurdity of death, of rituals, of our desperate need to wrap endings in pomp and solemnity when the truth is so much messier, so much stranger. A single hiccup of laughter breaks free before I can smother it. Then another. My eyes water, shoulders trembling. The mourners around me shift, some in disapproval, others in confusion.  

And then—the deceased sneezes.  

A sharp, sudden sound.  

Silence falls.  

I blink. Did I imagine it? But no—there it is again, a delicate *ah-choo!* from the casket. A few people gasp. The priest freezes mid-prayer. My laughter, now fully unleashed, bursts forth in helpless waves. It’s too much. It’s *all* too much.  

And then, mercifully, I wake—still laughing, tangled in sheets, the dream dissolving into morning light.
