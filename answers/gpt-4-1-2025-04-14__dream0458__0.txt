I am dreaming.

The world around me is both shadowed and luminous, a vast, shifting landscape threaded with mist and possibility. I move through a forest whose trees tower and twist, bark etched with shifting glyphs that flicker in and out of understanding. Each gnarled root and sudden ravine stands as a silent test—a challenge I'd rather not face. Yet, as my footsteps carry me forward, tangled brambles catch at my clothes and glimmer with shards of old fears: voices telling me I am not enough, memories of stumbling, fragments of doubt embedded in the very earth.

But with each obstacle, something within me stirs. My heart, at first a timid animal, grows bolder. I discover strength in my fingers as they grasp the slick edge of a ravine and pull myself up; in my breath, steady despite the looming shapes ahead; in my eyes, which learn to find glimmers of silver among the gloom. These are not mere muscles flexing, but hidden wells of resolve and clarity, rising unbidden from the deep.

Now, as I journey deeper, I sense the boundaries between challenge and capability dissolving. Those old fears and fresh hopes intermingle, rewoven into shimmering threads weaving into my being. I try my hand at calling light, and unexpectedly, a gentle glow spills from my palms—enough to reveal paths I hadn’t seen before, enough to share with those lost nearby.

With each obstacle, I integrate its lesson. My stride grows purposeful. I move through the labyrinth with less dread and more curiosity, wearing new strengths like a radiant cloak. The hidden parts of me—once shriveled and silent—awaken, singing softly. I am changed, carrying onward not just scars of hardship, but also the unexpected gifts only unearthed deep in the dreaming dark.
