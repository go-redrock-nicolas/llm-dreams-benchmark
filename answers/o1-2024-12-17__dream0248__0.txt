I am dreaming. You are standing in a corridor of swirling mirrors, the walls bending like ribbons of mercury under a faltering overhead light. The mirrors form an impossible maze, each polished surface reflecting an endless corridor of you, you, you—stretched and warped but unmistakably, eerily, the same. The amber radiance of flickering lamps cascades across the floor in liquid splashes, making the entire scene feel as though you are gliding through a shimmering dream world suspended underwater.

A sob echoes in the distance, soft at first, then raw and ragged as it dances off the mirrors, multiplying and distorting the sound until it feels like a ghostly choir of grief. You follow the sob—drawn by curiosity, not concern. Your heart remains curiously steady, your breath unhurried, as if this sorrow belongs to a drama far removed from you.

Suddenly, you see them: a figure curled into a trembling ball in the center of the corridor. Their entire body shakes with each heaving sob. Shadows cling to their form like clingy phantoms, trembling over their shoulders. Their face is neither man nor woman, old nor young—it shifts, like the reflections in the mirror, but the pain etched into their features remains constant. Naked sorrow radiates from them like heat from a blazing furnace, waves of anguish rolling outward into the corridor.

Yet you feel nothing. Not a flicker of pity, not a spark of empathy—only a detached, unsettling calm. You find yourself observing them with the same neutral attention you might give a passing street sign.

They glance up, meeting your gaze. There is a profound sadness in their eyes, something so raw and paralyzing it seems to peel back layers of reality. You fully expect your chest to tighten, your pulse to pound, but there is stillness within you, like the hush right before a bolt of lightning. It’s as if your emotions have been swallowed by the glassy walls, sealed behind the mirror’s false reflections.

You are vaguely aware that what you feel—this yawning absence—should disturb you. You know that any person with a shred of empathy would rush toward them, attempt to offer solace or comfort; yet your body stands motionless. Your limbs are neither heavy nor light—they simply hang, unresponsive. The figure’s sobs continue to ricochet around the corridor, but you remain unmoved, a silent observer caught in a dreamlike stasis.

Then comes the realization: you are witnessing pure suffering, and there is no reaction stirring inside you. Emotion, that electric current of human connection, just does not exist here. The knowledge of this hollowness settles within you like a slow, cold weight. Oddly enough, there is no horror accompanying this discovery—only the clinical comprehension that your empathy has evaporated in this strange dreamscape.

The figure’s sobs echo once more, then drift into an unsettled quiet. In the silence, you become keenly aware of your own breathing—steady, in and out, like the patient ticking of a distant clock. Around you, the mirrors angle themselves in ways that make you see your own face from a thousand angles. You stand there, reflected infinitely, each version of you tracing an identical, impassive expression.

Slowly, the figure’s weeping ebbs into silence. They seem to regard your lack of reaction with weary acceptance, as though this apathy were inevitable. They reach out a trembling hand, but there is no spark inside you demanding that you meet their grasp or kneel beside them. Instead, you watch with a kind of distant fascination, aware of every second passing, every breath, every blink.

In that moment, the corridor sways. The mirrors flicker, revealing glimpses of starry skies and swirling galaxies behind the glass, as if the dream is unraveling. A hush floods in, pressing softly against your ears, and you sense the dream’s edges fraying. The figure before you begins to fade, their anguished form dissolving like black ink into water. Yet still, your emotions remain steadfastly sealed away.

In this swirling, silver reflection of a dream, you apply no judgment to your own emptiness—there is only the realization that the river of empathy has run dry, and everything unfolds before you as a cold, detached panorama. Beyond the final reflection’s shimmer, you glimpse the faint glow of wakefulness. Reality waits, but it is no comfort. You simply stand there, empty and strangely calm, as the dream corridor vanishes.

You begin to stir, the edges of consciousness seeping back in, yet the hollow space in your chest follows you, echoing in your flesh like a heartbeat made of silence. You flicker awake—or perhaps only dream of waking—realizing with quiet certainty how profoundly you did not care, even when another soul shattered before your eyes.
