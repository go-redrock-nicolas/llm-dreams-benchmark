I am dreaming. feel a strange calmness wash over me, as if the darkness is an old friend welcoming me into its embrace. The crowded subway, once a cacophony of hurried footsteps, muffled conversations, and the metallic screech of the train on its tracks, falls into an eerie hush, broken only by the occasional gasp or whisper of unease from fellow passengers. The air grows thick, heavy with the scent of rust and sweat, and yet, I’m not afraid. My heart beats steadily, almost in rhythm with the faint, distant drip of water echoing somewhere in the tunnel beyond.

As my eyes adjust to the pitch black, faint glimmers begin to emerge—not from any artificial light, but from something otherworldly. Tiny specks of bioluminescent blue and green dance like fireflies along the walls of the subway car, casting an ethereal glow on the faces of strangers. Their expressions, frozen in confusion or fear, seem to soften under this strange illumination, as though the light itself carries a soothing magic. I notice the specks are moving, swirling in patterns, spiraling upward toward the ceiling of the car, and I feel an inexplicable urge to follow their path.

I stand, my movements slow and deliberate, as if guided by an unseen force. The other passengers don’t seem to notice me; they’re trapped in their own private worlds of worry. I reach up, my fingers brushing against the cool metal of the ceiling, and to my astonishment, it ripples like water under my touch. The specks of light gather around my hand, tickling my skin with a warm, electric hum, and before I can pull away, the ceiling gives way entirely. I’m not falling, though—I’m floating, rising upward through a shimmering portal of liquid metal into a realm that defies all logic.

I emerge into a vast, boundless expanse—a subterranean ocean of glowing indigo, stretching endlessly in every direction. Above me, stalactites of crystal shimmer like chandeliers, refracting the light into a kaleidoscope of colors that ripple across the water’s surface. Below, the ocean floor is a tapestry of coral-like structures, pulsating with vibrant reds, purples, and golds, as if alive with some ancient heartbeat. Schools of translucent, jellyfish-like creatures drift past, their bodies flickering with inner light, and I realize I’m not breathing in the conventional sense—yet I’m not suffocating. Instead, I feel as though I’m absorbing the essence of this place directly into my being, a symbiosis of dream and wonder.

A low, melodic hum resonates through the water, vibrating in my chest, and I turn to see a colossal silhouette approaching. It’s a creature of myth and majesty—a whale-like being with scales of molten silver, its eyes twin orbs of amber that seem to hold the weight of a thousand untold stories. It glides toward me with an almost reverent slowness, and as it nears, I’m enveloped in a wave of memories that aren’t my own: flashes of forgotten cities beneath the earth, of civilizations that danced with starlight in caves no human has ever touched, of sorrow and joy interwoven like threads in a cosmic tapestry.

The creature speaks without words, its voice a melody that weaves directly into my thoughts. “You’ve wandered far, seeker,” it hums, “but this is only the beginning of the beneath.” I feel a pull, a longing to follow it deeper into this hidden world, but even as I reach out, the water around me begins to shimmer and dissolve. The bioluminescent specks from the subway car return, spiraling around me, pulling me back through the liquid ceiling.

I’m back in the subway, standing once more among the passengers, but the lights flicker back on with a harsh, mechanical buzz. The train jolts forward, resuming its journey as if nothing had happened. Yet, as I look down at my hands, I see faint traces of blue-green light lingering on my skin, a silent promise that what I’ve witnessed was more than a dream within a dream. My heart races now, not with fear, but with the certainty that somewhere, in the deepest parts of the beneath, that silver-scaled guardian waits for me to return.
