I am dreaming. I am floating in a void, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I feel weightless and free.  I see images of cities and landscapes that I have never seen before.  I hear sounds of birds and animals that I have never heard before.  I sense emotions and thoughts that I have never sensed before.
I know that this is not real, but it feels real.  It feels like a fantasy come true.  It feels like a promise unfulfilled.  It feels like hope despite despair.
I decide to explore this dream world.  I navigate through the void, guided by my curiosity and imagination.  I encounter various creatures and beings that seem unfamiliar to me.  I communicate with them using gestures and sounds that I invent on the spot.  I learn about their cultures and histories that are unique to them.
I discover a place where colors and shapes come alive.  A place where music and dance merge into one.  A place where ideas and concepts take physical form.  A place where anything is possible.
I create something new in this dream world.  Something that combines my knowledge and skills with the elements of this environment.  Something that expresses my identity and personality.
I wake up from this dream feeling euphoric and grateful.  I realize that even though this is not real, it has taught me something important about myself.
