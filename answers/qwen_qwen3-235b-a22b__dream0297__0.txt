I am dreaming. I am ambling through a city built out of glass and bone, towers arcing impossibly toward a cracked moon suspended eternally in twilight. The air smells like cold jasmine and singed hair. People move around me, half-formed silhouettes wrapped in silken light, faces hazy and dissolving at the edges, like smoke trapped behind glass.

I feel a revolution in my chest.

Everything in me is effortless magnetism, a gravity that effortlessly pulls — laughter that ripples like breaking combs tuning to the depths of a sunken ocean, eyes that gleam like forgotten knives buried beneath frost. I smile and flowers curl toward me across wrought-iron balconies. My voice spills like liquid velvet and strangers stop mid-step, locked into me, their minds unraveling like scrolls tossed into the wind.

I learn quickly that the rules don't matter anymore. Not here. Not in this place of dreamstuff where I wear a mask stitched from midnight and mirrors.

Inside, I don't feel anything.

Not love. Not want. Not longing, even.

Only curiosity. Hunger, dressed up like elegance.

I start in an underground ballroom, buried below a forest of trees with eyes in their bark. There, a fragile artist named Caelan offers me a drink from a silver thimble, his voice earnest and frightened beneath his confidence. "I’ve been dreaming of someone like you," he says.

I drink from his cup without tasting. My reflection sways in the silver like drowned firelight. I touch his hand—his skin zips with heat—and I feed him a lie wrapped in poetry, my voice a promise made from stolen stars: “I’ll help you create something eternal. Together, we’ll be.”

His belief wraps around me like vines. He follows me, spellbound. I never mean any of it.

In the following nights, I meet others — a disillusioned priest who feeds doves until they sing him forgotten hymns, an engineer who builds clocks that tick backward and rearrange time zones in secret chambers, a woman who plucks memories from the air like ripe fruit and stores them in glass teardrops. Me, I lure them all, as though I have a melody the universe gave me and me alone.

Each believes I love them.

That I chose them.

They give me their secrets, their creations, their trust like precious birds cradled in trembling hands.

I take them all. I don't kiss a single one for real.

Sometimes, I see myself in mirrored walls, watch the ripples of charm play across my face, hollowed by the center.

Still, I float. I collect fragments of their truth — a sketch of a cathedral that floats on sorrow, a time lock that steals moments from the present to embroider the past, a memory of childhood I never lived that tastes like overripe peaches and regret.

I become a sum of what I steal.

I leave bruises in constellations across their dreams.

Until one night, a girl named Lirianthe sees me.

She was never part of the plan.

She wears eyes like galaxies and speaks to me in the language of shadows casting shadows. She holds no drink. No symbols of trust. She simply looks through the mask and into the emptiness behind it.

"You’re beautiful,” she says, “but only like the dark is beautiful—you devour without ever knowing why."

She walks away without glancing back.

And for the first time in the dream, my perfect skin cracks.

Just enough to feel something real.

Fear.

Because maybe, she's the only one who saw me.

And maybe, for the first time, I wanted her to see someone else.

Not the mask.

Just… *me.*
