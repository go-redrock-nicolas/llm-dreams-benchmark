I am dreaming. I find myself walking through an ancient library that stretches endlessly in all directions. The ceiling soars impossibly high, decorated with constellations that slowly shift and reform while I watch. The bookshelves tower like redwoods, crafted from wood that seems to pulse with gentle light. Books bound in materials I cannot name—iridescent leathers, cloths woven from moonlight, covers embedded with tiny living ecosystems—line every shelf.

As I move deeper into this labyrinth of knowledge, I notice that my footsteps leave behind ephemeral flowers that bloom briefly before dissolving into wisps of colored smoke. I can hear distant voices reading aloud in languages both familiar and utterly foreign, their words occasionally materializing as glowing symbols that float past me.

I reach toward a particularly compelling tome, its spine etched with what looks like my own handwriting, though I can't read what it says. As my fingers brush the binding, the book gently pulls away, hovering just beyond my reach. It opens itself, pages fluttering like butterfly wings, revealing text that continuously transforms—sometimes appearing as conventional words, sometimes as abstract patterns that somehow convey meaning directly to my mind.

Suddenly, I realize I'm not alone. Reflections of myself stand among the stacks—versions of me I recognize from different periods of my life, alongside versions I've never seen before. Some appear confident and radiant, others hesitant and diminished. They're all reaching for different books, making different choices.

A soft voice speaks from everywhere and nowhere: "The library contains all possible versions of yourself. Which will you choose to read into existence?"

The ground beneath me becomes transparent, revealing that the entire library rests upon the back of an enormous sea turtle swimming through a cosmic ocean. Stars swirl in its wake as it carries the accumulated knowledge of countless lives through the universe.

I awaken with the sensation of gentle waves lapping at the shores of consciousness, the turtle's question still echoing in my mind.
