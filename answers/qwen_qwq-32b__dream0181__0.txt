I am dreaming. I’ve been appointed to this powerful position... but how? I have no qualifications. Yet, here I am, standing in a grand, mirror-lined hall. The air hums with static, like the tension before a storm. Below me, in a vast amphitheater, the members of the Council of Echoes wait. Their faces are featureless, shifting like smoke. Some hold scepters of fractured crystal; others wear robes woven from starlight. They murmur in unison, voices blurred into a single, dissatisfied drone. One steps forward, their form coalescing into a woman with hair like liquid mercury and eyes like dying stars. "Prove your worth," she hisses. "Or we’ll consign you to the Null Vault, where all unproven rulers go to dissolve into static." The ground trembles as my reply hangs in the air. I need to act, but what can I do? My mind races, but then— Wait, the mirrors! They’re not just decoration. Each reflects not me, but a different timeline, a different possibility. In one, I’m addressing the crowd with confident oratory; in another, I’m crumbling into dust. In the third... I flick my wrist, and the mirrors ripple, their images colliding. The Council gasps as the timelines converge, projecting my resolve across every pane. The mercury-woman scowls but signals assent. My rule is... tentatively acknowledged. But the Null Vault looms. I must keep proving myself, always.\
