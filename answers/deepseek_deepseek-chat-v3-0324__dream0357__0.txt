I am dreaming. At first, there is only darkness—a velvet void, vast and infinite. But gradually, as if breaching the surface of a deep ocean, shapes emerge. I find myself standing on a bridge suspended between two cliffs, its ancient stones weathered by eons of unseen storms. Below, an abyss yawns, swallowing light, sound, even thought. The air hums with the whispers of thousands of voices—no, not voices—more like the echoes of lives once lived, now carried on the wind as half-remembered dreams.  

The bridge trembles beneath my feet. I realize, with a marrow-deep certainty, that it is disintegrating. Each step I take crumbles into the abyss, leaving nothing behind. Panic rises, thick in my throat—but then, a figure emerges at the far end of the bridge. A mirror of myself, but older, wearier, robes frayed like the edges of time itself.  

**"Every step is a choice,"** the other-me says. **"And every choice is a surrender."**  

The sky above splits open, revealing not stars but eyes—countless, watching, unblinking. They are the eyes of the universe, witnessing the fragile thread of my existence. The wind howls, carrying my breath away before I can scream. The bridge collapses.  

But I do not fall.  

Instead, I float—not in defiance of gravity, but because gravity has forgotten me. As if the world no longer knows I exist. The hollow fear of vanishing pulses through me, but then—  

A hand touches my shoulder. Warm. Real. The vision fractures, and suddenly laughter erupts around me—children running through golden fields, a mother singing, the smell of bread baking. Life, in all its unremarkable, unbearable beauty.  

*This,* the dream whispers, *is what you are afraid to lose.*  

The landscape shudders, folds in on itself. Darkness reclaims me.  

And I awaken—gasping, clutching my chest, the taste of both terror and gratitude heavy on my tongue.
