I am dreaming. **You Are Dreaming**  

The world around you shimmers like liquid gold, the edges of reality softening into a dreamscape both foreign and achingly familiar. You stand at the center of an endless library, its towering shelves spiraling into infinity, ancient tomes bound in leather whispering your name in a chorus of forgotten tongues. The air hums with electricity, thick with the scent of parchment and burning candle wax.  

Then—the message arrives.  

A single envelope, heavy with the weight of centuries, materializes in your hands. Its paper is neither hot nor cold but pulses with a living warmth, as if something inside breathes. The wax seal crumbles at your touch, dissolving like sugar in rain, and as you unfold the parchment, the truth unfurls before you in inked, glowing symbols.  

*You are not who you believe yourself to be.*  

The words rewrite your bones. Memories flood your mind, but they don’t belong to you—or rather, they *do*, only they have been hidden, folded away like a secret map sewn into your skin. You see flashes of a life unlived: a childhood beneath twin moons, a language you once spoke fluently now buried beneath layers of borrowed tongues, a face—*your face*—reflected in a silver pool that does not obey the laws of mirrors.  

And the most astonishing thing? You are not afraid.  

A deep, resonant laughter bubbles up from your chest, unburdened and free. The library responds, its shelves trembling, ladders sliding along the aisles as if in celebration. The books flutter their pages like wings, and one drifts down from the highest vault of the impossible ceiling. It lands before you, its cover etched with a name you suddenly remember: yours, but the *real* one, the one woven into your soul long before you were ever called anything else.  

You open it—and the world *sings*.  

Now, you are standing at the threshold of a doorway that wasn't there before, limned in golden light. Beyond it, a city rises—spires of crystal and twilight, streets paved with the echoes of choices unmade. The wind carries voices, your name among them, calling you forward.  

This is not an ending. It is the first page of a story you always knew was waiting.  

And you step through.
