I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a vast, mirrored obsidian lake, its surface so still it reflects the constellations above with crystalline clarity. But something is shifting—the stars ripple, rearrange themselves, as if my very gaze is rewriting the heavens. I feel a tug in my chest, a sensation like roots being pulled gently from damp earth. The belief—that old, quiet whisper of *not enough, too much, unworthy*—hovers before me, crystallized into a heavy locket hanging from a silver chain. It thrums with the weight of years, etched with scars from battles I no longer remember fighting.

Suddenly, the locket cracks. A light, golden and liquid, spills from its center, and the chain dissolves into smoke. As it falls, the lake swallows it whole, sending rings of violet and indigo rippling outward. The water stirs, and from its depths rises a figure—me, but not me. This version glows with wild energy, eyes like molten copper, hair woven with seafoam and wind. She reaches for me, hands warm with embers, and says, *"You’ve outgrown your name for sorrow."*

The reflection pulls me into the lake. Instead of drowning, I shatter into a thousand fireflies, each carrying a fragment of the old belief in their tiny, glowing bodies. They scatter into the night, painting the sky with flickering constellations—new myths, new patterns. Below, the water reshapes itself into a doorway of swirling mist. Through it, I see a valley where trees grow upside-down, their roots cradling galaxies, and my footsteps leave blooms of luminous moss in their wake. 

A voice, neither mine nor foreign, hums on the breeze: *"This is what it feels like to molt a shadow."* 

I wake, breathless, clutching my chest where the locket used to be—only to find skin smooth, unburdened, humming with dawn.
