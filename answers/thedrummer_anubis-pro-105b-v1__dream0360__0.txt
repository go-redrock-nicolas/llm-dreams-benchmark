I am dreaming. As I continue drifting through my dream, I catch myself projecting past relationship dynamics onto a current situation where they don't apply. I am standing in a vibrant meadow overgrown with flora, the colors kicking around in full features of the mind's eye. 

Suddenly, I hear a nasal voice arguing with me. It's an exaggerated version from an ex. I watch the train of thought left abandoned while trying to break this unconscious transfer from the mind. Yet one who chose me for such a task would argue, "Regardless of their rung on the corporate ladder, their secure protector instinct is on display everywhere."

Luckily throughout the course of the dream, moments rush past my eyes reminding me of the good times with my former lover and am able to shake this fleeting illusion. I watch my ex lover from outside of the meadow before finally closing my eyes utterly lost. 

No food is working. The meadow is too barren for small animals. Certainly, my ex is confused and disturbed in these moments. I stare into the meadow and exclaim, "Just as the river is constantly changing, it does not change for one's soul. One's soul is not built by others, but our own."

I stand in the silent silence of the meadow as tracks run along the outer rim. A Rail Trail within my mind brings this cowardly lust we've all felt the mere adversary in this challenge of rationality for the mind. With panic in the for my ex is begging to stay but I tell him, "If we corner ourselves, then we also isolate ourselves."

I walk through the patches of the once vibrant land realizing now I'm not the only one going down this path within the world of another. My unconscious is working to loosen all ropes within this rift. My heart race. Picking up the pace I am close, how close...awakening.
