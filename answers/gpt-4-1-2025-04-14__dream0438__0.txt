I am dreaming.

It began with a simple desire to escape, not to heal. I found myself wandering, barefoot, through a dappled forest soaked in the honeyed gold of late afternoon. My only intention was to walk far enough into the woods that the noise and clutter of my waking life would fade into silence. I craved only quiet, not knowing that this would become a symphony of emotion and renewal.

A winding path appeared, paved not with stones but with velvety moss and the fallen petals of ancient, unknowable flowers. I followed the trail, at first merely admiring the shifting play of light and shadow. Soon, I stumbled upon a circle of paints and empty canvases arranged beneath the towering shelter of a grandmother oak. Their presence was unexpected, inexplicable; I had not sought art for solace, merely for distraction.

Compelled, I bent and took up a brush. My hands moved with a certainty I did not recognize, painting shapes and colors without conscious thought. At first, I was simply absorbed in the movement and texture—the cool, yielding paint, the whisper of bristles on canvas. But as images began to form, glimmering dream-figures surged from the depths: my younger self, smiling shyly; wounds from the past, transformed into vibrant scarlet blooms; words I’d carried like weights, dissolving into ephemeral swirls of violet fog.

Each stroke became an offering—a gentle unravelling of old hurts, a tender patchwork of forgiveness for myself and others. Colors sang where once there had only been grey silence in my heart. Listening to the hush of the woods, I realized tears were streaming down my face, not of sorrow, but release.

As twilight gathered above the tree branches, the boundary between forest and canvas melted away. I could feel my breath syncing with the rustle of leaves, my heart expanding wide enough to hold all I had lost and all I had yet to find. Joy welled up—swift and unexpected—woven through with a hum of quiet reassurance. The activity I had chosen simply to fill a restless afternoon had unspooled the tangled knots within me; painting, I had found a healing deeper than words.

Embracing this discovery, I dipped my brush back into indigo, ready to keep painting beneath the stars, my heart lighter with each gentle sweep—as if every color contained a secret promise that healing, too, could arrive like this: unexpectedly beautiful, just beneath the skin of an ordinary day.
