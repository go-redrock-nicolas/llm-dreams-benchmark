I am dreaming. The air hums with a strange, electric charge, like the moment before a storm breaks. I stand in the center of an ancient amphitheater, its stone steps worn smooth by centuries of unseen spectators. The sky above is a swirling tapestry of indigo and gold, streaked with constellations I don’t recognize.  

I’ve never held a bow before, yet my fingers curl around the polished wood of a violin with instinctive familiarity. The instrument feels alive in my hands, humming faintly as if resonating with my pulse. Around me, a crowd materializes—silhouettes with glowing eyes, their faces shifting like smoke. They murmur in a language that thrums through my bones, wordless yet understood: *Play.*  

I raise the bow. The first note shatters the air, a sound so pure it crystallizes the very light around us. My hands move without thought, weaving a melody that doesn’t just fill the amphitheater but *unfolds* it—the arches bloom into vast, silver trees, the stars above shudder and realign into new patterns. The music isn’t just heard; it’s *seen*, felt, a living thing that twists time. With each stroke, I realize I’m not playing the violin—I’m playing the fabric of the dream itself.  

The crowd sways, their forms melting and reforming in time with the notes. A figure steps forward—tall, crowned with antlers made of shadow and starlight. They extend a hand, and as the final note trembles in the air, the world holds its breath.  

*"Again,"* the figure whispers, though their voice is the wind, the creak of the trees, the distant crash of a wave.  

And I understand, with dreamlike certainty, that this isn’t just talent. It’s a language I’ve always known, waiting to be remembered.  

Then—I wake. The echo of the melody lingers for half a heartbeat before dissolving, leaving only the ghost of a bow’s weight in my empty hands.
