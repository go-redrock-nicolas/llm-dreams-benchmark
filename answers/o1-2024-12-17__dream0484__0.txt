I am dreaming. You open your eyes to a sky brushed with the palette of dusk—bands of rosy gold and plum running together like watercolors above your head. A whisper of wind greets you. It carries a faint melody, both familiar and brand-new, that tugs at your memory as if inviting you to follow. You notice you’re standing at the edge of a vast, rolling meadow. Each blade of grass is taller than it should be, shimmering in a deep turquoise hue, and curling gently against your ankles as though waving hello.

In the distance, a solitary tree beckons—remarkably tall and crowned with leaves of vibrant emerald and silver. The trunk twists like a rooted serpent, creating a hollow at its center. It feels alive, aware, and curious about your presence. As you begin walking toward it, each step produces soft lights on the ground, like tiny fireworks under your feet.

Your heart pulses with mingled anticipation and apprehension. You have come here guided by a dream-logic that places no barriers in your path. There is an almost electric energy in the air, crackling around you, and inside that crackle, you sense an invitation: something in this place is about to confide in you a secret you’ve long doubted, or perhaps never considered would be questioned at all.

Reaching the tree, you peer into the hollow trunk. At first, it seems like a dim, empty niche. But then a glow ignites in the center—swirling colors radiating outward. You watch, entranced, as a delicate scene emerges: moving images like reflections on water. There, in the swirling light, you see yourself—only this version of you is untethered by any familiar burden. This phantom self stands proudly, like a dancer poised before taking flight.

A deep voice, resonant as rolling thunder, echoes through your consciousness. It is neither male nor female, neither harsh nor gentle, but it carries authority: “This story you carry about who you must be—it was never yours.”

Those words sink in, each syllable sharpening your focus until you can scarcely breathe. Flashes of memory rush past you: embarrassments, regrets, long nights of self-doubt spent believing you were not strong enough, not gifted enough, not worthy enough. Each old, well-worn, limiting belief flickers and dissolves like dark moths driven away by flame.

The swirl in the heart of the hollow glows even brighter, and you feel a shift in your chest, as though an invisible chain coiled around your heart suddenly falls away. The weight you hadn’t realized you carried is lifted, and in its wake, a gentle curiosity flowers. You sense it in every part of your being—pure possibility. You are free.

Now the air in the meadow warms, and the horizon shimmers, as if inviting you onward. A path forms, built of steppingstones that seem to sparkle with moonlit crystals. You place your foot on the first step, expecting it to be cold, but instead it feels like stepping on a plush cloud. Each subsequent stone hums softly beneath you, resonating with your heartbeat, as if cheering you on.

Ahead, the path transforms into a spiral staircase of pastel blues and lavenders, winding upward into the sky. You ascend, feeling the cool twilight breeze lifting your hair as you climb. When you reach the top, you find yourself on a floating platform ringed by luminescent orbs that revolve around you in a protective dance. Stars glisten overhead, but they seem so close—almost within reach.

For a moment, you pause. The question drifts into your mind unbidden: “Who am I, if not the person I believed I had to be?” The orbiting lights pulse in joyous response, glimmers of cosmic encouragement. Liberated now from that binding self-perception, you inhale deeply, and with a gentle exhale, you leap off the platform. Instead of falling, you float effortlessly, buoyed by faith in your unburdened self.

The sky cradles you, welcoming you like a treasured guest. You drift among the stars, each one whispering encouragement, singing a soft chorus of “Remember who you truly are.” You are weightless and unafraid, a glimpse of starlight dancing above a wondrous realm. In this dreamscape, your newly awakened heart is alive with a limitless sense of possibility. And in that moment, you understand that no story—not even one held for a lifetime—can stand in the way of your boundless being.
