I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the static of forgotten languages as you step into the labyrinth. Its walls are not stone but towering slabs of obsidian, etched with glowing veins of cerulean light that pulse like a heartbeat. The ground beneath your bare feet shifts subtly—a mosaic of shifting tiles, each inscribed with cryptic symbols that rearrange themselves when you blink. Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of fractured constellations, constellations that don’t exist in any earthly firmament, their stars winking in and out of existence like eyes blinking in the dark.  

The first puzzle waits at the maze’s mouth: a colossal archway of interlocking gears, each tooth carved with runes. To pass, you must align the symbols to form a coherent phrase in a tongue you’ve never learned but somehow *remember*. Your fingers tremble as you twist the gears, the metal warm and almost alive. When the runes click into place—*“The answer is the question you fear to ask”*—the arch groans and dissolves into a mist that clings to your skin like spider silk.  

As you venture deeper, the maze narrows into corridors that breathe. The walls contract and expand, forcing you to solve riddles etched into their surfaces before the walls crush you. One demands you calculate the weight of a shadow cast by a star that died a billion years ago. Another shows a mirror that reflects not your face, but a fractal landscape of your memories—each shard revealing a moment you’ve buried. You solve them by speaking in equations and metaphors, your voice cracking with the strain of holding paradoxes in your mind.  

The air thickens with the scent of ozone and burnt parchment. At the maze’s heart, you find a chamber where gravity unravels. Floating platforms hover like lily pads in a void, each inscribed with a fragment of a celestial map. To cross, you must piece together the map not as it is, but as it *will be* in a thousand years, predicting the dance of dying stars. Your hands bleed from the effort of grasping the threads of time, but the platforms solidify beneath your feet, trembling like the strings of a harp.  

Beyond lies the final puzzle: a monolith of black crystal, its surface rippling like liquid. It shows you a face—your own, but older, wearier, with eyes that hold the weight of unspeakable truths. The monolith speaks without sound, demanding you solve the equation of your own existence: *What is the sum of your regrets, multiplied by the square root of your desires?* You collapse, screaming the answer into the void, and the crystal shatters into a thousand doves that carry pieces of your soul into the sky.  

But as the maze dissolves, you realize the dream isn’t over. The doves return, dropping a single key into your palm—a key that burns with the knowledge that the maze will wait, forever shifting, forever hungry, until you dare to enter again.
