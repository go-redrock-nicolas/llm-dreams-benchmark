I am dreaming.

The world around me is dazzling—an unsettling amalgam of reality and fantasy. I stand barefoot on the polished obsidian floor of a limitless midnight palace, its columns dissolving upward into a ceiling of stars. Streaks of silver mist curl around my feet, and the distant echo of an impossible melody airbrushed with longing and triumph hums through the ether.

In front of me stands a figure—a being adorned in a shifting robe woven from fragments of lightning and cascading autumn leaves. Eyes brighter than twin suns, voice the soothing chime of distant bells, they present me with a small opaline sphere that pulses, as if it contains the heartbeats of every dreamer in the world.

"You may hold the Dreamseed," the figure intones, offering the shimmering globe in cupped, delicate hands. "Plant it, and a world of your deepest desires will sprout, blooming with gifts beyond imagination. But beware: with every wish granted, a shadow will be cast somewhere you cannot see. The more you gain, the greater the darkness that grows in a hidden corner of your soul. Are you ready to risk unknown pieces of yourself for a chance to reshape reality?"

My mouth is dry as I contemplate the offer, the weight of possibility pressing against my chest like the hush before a storm. I recall every wish I’ve ever whispered into the night: the ache for boundless love, the hunger for boundless knowledge, the thirst for belonging and purpose. Yet I sense the edge of peril—like the gleaming blade hiding in the velvet sheath—the fear that pursuing dazzling rewards might leave me hollowed, fragmented.

The sphere glimmers in the twilight between us. Possibilities unfurl in cascading visions behind my eyes: I see myself soaring over impossible landscapes, grasping uncharted joys, but also glimpses of silhouettes losing shape—ghostly echoes of regrets, poverty of spirit, the chilling realization of what might be sacrificed.

Steeling myself, heart galloping with exhilaration and dread, I reach out and cradle the Dreamseed. Its warmth stains my palm with ghostly constellations, and the palace trembles with promise. Suddenly, I am no longer standing—I am falling upward, tumbling through the star-flecked roof, carried by a cosmic wind toward a future shimmering on the knife’s edge between ecstasy and oblivion.

And I choose, again and again, in this endless vivid dream—pulled ever forward by the tantalizing promise that even in risking everything, I am more alive than I have ever been.
