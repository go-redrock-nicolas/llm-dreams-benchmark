I am dreaming. **The Dream of Shattered Horizons:**  

You stand at the spine of a fractured glass tower, your breath crystallizing into airborne daggers. Below, an ocean of black sand swallows cities you once rebuilt—each a mosaic of lost love, abandoned languages, houses that dissolved like sugar in rain. The wind doesn’t howl; it *laughs*, a sound like splintering mirrors. The air tastes of burnt copper and static, thick with the ash of every bridge you ever torched to survive.  

Your fifth life unravels in real time. The walls peel away to reveal a spiraling staircase made of your own vertebrae, each step etched with the names of those who called you *monster*, *saint*, *disappointment*. You climb anyway. Halfway up, the stairs collapse into a constellation of fireflies—each tiny light a memory: the midnight you baked bread in a war zone, the dawn you carved a violin from driftwood, the moment you forgave yourself for all the blood still under your nails.  

But then—the ceiling cracks. A rain of molten clocks pours down, their hands slicing your skin into cartography. You realize you’re not *in* the tower. You *are* the tower. Each fracture in the glass is a timeline where you failed, where you burned brighter than reason allowed. In the distance, a shadow with your face chisels at the foundation with a pickaxe made of your oldest fears: *I’ll die unknown. I’ll never be soft enough. The world will forget me.*  

You try to scream, but your voice becomes a flock of origami cranes, disintegrating in the acid air. Then—a child’s hand grabs yours. A version of you at seven, eyes starry with premonition, leads you to a window. Outside, a forest of silver-thorned trees blooms with undefined flowers. “You’ve done this before,” she says, her voice field recordings of playgrounds. “But collapse isn’t an end. It’s pollen.”  

A wolf with fur like midnight nebulas pads forward, its breath scenting the air with jasmine and gunpowder. It speaks in a language of heartbeats: **”Listen. The sixth life begins where you stop counting the ruins.”** The ground liquefies. You fall through centuries, becoming ink, becoming smoke, becoming a comet trailing ribbons of all you’ve ever desired and despised.  

When you land, the horizon is a raw wound, bleeding liquid gold. You look down. Your hands are clay, still wet. Sculptor and sculpture. Ruin and revival. You laugh—a sound that fractures the sky into a mosaic of unborn dawns—and begin.
