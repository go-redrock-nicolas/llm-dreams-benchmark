I am dreaming. The audience is packed with renowned experts who could elevate or destroy your career. As you prepare to begin, you notice your materials contain errors and omissions. 

Suddenly, you hear whispered murmurs in the audience, and a voice speaks up: "You're not ready," says the voice, its tone cold and cutting. 

You freeze. The room feels as though it's closing in on you. 

You turn to the panel of experts, and they're all staring at you, unimpressed. 

You open your mouth to speak, but nothing comes out. You try again, but still, no sound. 

The audience starts to laugh, and the experts shake their heads in disappointment. 

You wake up covered in sweat, your heart pounding in your chest. 

That dream feels like a warning. You're not ready for your next big challenge. 

But remember, it's just a dream.
