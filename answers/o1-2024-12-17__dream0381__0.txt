I am dreaming. You’re drifting in the realm between slumber and consciousness, and when your dream finally solidifies, you find yourself in a landscape that defies all logic. It’s a shore where one side is a lush meadow of swaying amethyst-colored grasses, and the other side is composed of jagged black crystals rising out of a midnight ocean. The wind is warm yet tinged with a faint metallic scent—like the taste of blood at the back of your tongue. There is an otherworldly hush all around: the stars in the sky flicker in shades of violet, turquoise, and scarlet, illuminating everything in soft pulses. Despite the initial peace, you sense an underlying tension as you spot shifting silhouettes gliding at the edges of your vision.

You wander toward the meadow, following a path of pale lilac stones. Suddenly, figures materialize from thin air, each wearing faceless masks made of mirrored glass that reflect your own startled expression back at you. They beckon you closer. Compelled by a powerful yearning, you move in their direction, ignoring the subtle aches tugging at your heart. With every step, the vegetation underfoot transforms from lush grass to sparse brambles, digging into your ankles. Though each prick stings, you push forward, enthralled by the radiant glow of the figures’ reflective masks and the possibility that they may offer you solace from some unspoken loneliness. Yet as you reach them, their mirrored surfaces crack and shatter, releasing sharp fragments that scatter into the wind and pierce your skin. The pain is startling, yet some part of you feels almost comfortable with it—familiar, as though you’ve arrived at a predictable end.

Realization seeps in like golden sunlight through storm clouds. You recognize this pattern: a longing for comfort, for acceptance, that time and again steers you into razor-sharp illusions. It dawns on you that these figures of the dream—glistening, lovely, yet hollow—are manifestations of the same self-destructive thread woven into your life. The sense of déjà vu is impossible to ignore. You’ve stood here, heart pounding and limbs trembling, in so many variations of this dream. But this time, something changes. The trembling tips of your fingers curl into determined fists. A resolve you’ve never felt before sparks in your chest.

Instead of chasing the phantom shapes, you step back, closing your eyes to the chaos. You take a moment to breathe in the shimmering, surreal atmosphere. Inhaling feels like drawing in stardust, exhaling like releasing entire galaxies, allowing ancient burdens to leave your body. When you open your eyes again, the masked figures have melted into ghostly wisps, drifting away as if you’d exorcised them by refusing to follow. The brambles wither, and the stones beneath your feet become smooth, sapphire tiles. There’s a sense of quiet relief as the wagons of pain depart, replaced by a gentle lullaby of distant waves. You have broken the cycle.

Now, a pearlescent moon brightens the horizon, and the black ocean becomes a tapestry of flickering lights. You walk toward its shimmering surface and run your hand along the water’s edge. The reflection staring back at you is, at last, your own—unmasked, honest, and filled with dawn-lit hope. The pain still thrums in your memory, but you feel its grip loosening as a new dreamscape unfolds. You have recognized the pattern, and now you stand on a threshold of renewal, poised to choose a path of healing rather than one that spirals into perpetual hurt. The swirling cosmos above seems to applaud, glowing brighter than ever, as if to say: here lies transformation, and you are finally ready to embrace it.
