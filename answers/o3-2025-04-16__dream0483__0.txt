I am dreaming. …slip across the border of sleep and find yourself standing ankle-deep in moonlight.  It is not a pool of silver light scattered on a floor; it is a literal liquid moon-glow, cool as mountain water and restless as spilled mercury, lapping at your calves with little tinkling chimes each time it touches skin.  Above, nothing resembles an ordinary night sky.  The heavens are a humming vault of stained glass gears—lapis wheels, ruby sprockets, citrine pendulums—turning with a clockwork patience that you vaguely recognize as your own heartbeat.  Time, you realize, has been externalized here, made into visible machinery.  All those private deadlines you once clung to—be married by thirty, be brilliant by twenty-five, be unbreakable always—spin enormous and gaudy over your head, but you can now see that they are only colored glass, fragile and ornamental.  Their grinding used to deafen you; in this dreamscape they simply whir like distant wind chimes.

A path unfurls at your feet, not paved but painted—broad strokes of indigo, vermilion, and persimmon glowing as though the floor itself is a living mural.  Each time you take a step a new brushstroke appears; each time you hesitate the paint puddles and smears.  You see at once the metaphor: your forward movement clarifies the world, but the moment you pause to question “Am I doing this right?” the very ground becomes muddled.  And because you are dreaming—and know that you are dreaming—you try an experiment.  You inhale, hold the entire gallery of your expectations in a single tense breath, and then you exhale deliberately, almost ceremonially.  With that breath the smeared colors dry, edges sharpen, and the path snakes forward in confident ribbon-curves.  Even here, letting go removes the static from reality.

High above, one of the stained-glass gears sputters and jams.  It is the gear titled “Things Should Have Been Easier.”  The moment it sticks, shrapnel of crimson light rains down and strikes the painted path; the vibrant strokes begin to blister, bubble, and erode under that tempest of self-pity.  Panic nips at your ribs—old conditioning rockets up—but you catch it before it overwhelms you.  “Expectation,” you whisper, naming the gear, naming the mechanism, and the jammed cog disintegrates into a flock of ruby-feathered birds that wheel away, cawing jubilantly.  The rain stops.  The paint heals.  The dream nods as if to say, Exactly.

You continue, and the horizon performs a quick, almost curtain-call transformation.  The liquid moonlight recedes into the river behind you; ahead stretches an enormous library whose bookshelves are made of murmuring waterfalls.  Each cascade is a torrent of unread stories, but you notice most spines reserve space for a single word: Should.  Should stands there like a librarian policing silence in the mind.  You step closer and realize every book feels unexpectedly heavy—water pouring through the leather covers has swollen them into impossible burdens.  When you pluck one from the shelf it immediately dissolves into a handful of fresh rain that patters harmlessly onto your palms.  No thunder, no disaster, just a short lived sprinkling.  A grin tugs your cheeks.  Was that all?  Some soggy pages?  You tip the shelf sideways and with a delighted crash, every Should in your private library empties itself into a mist, fragrant as petrichor and just as ephemeral.

A door appears where a shelf used to stand—walnut wood veined with gold leaf that throbs like a slow pulse.  You step through and emerge on a cliff that overlooks an ocean of breathing glass.  The sea inhales—the mirrored surface domes upward, reflecting constellations that no telescope has ever named.  The sea exhales—the mirror implodes softly, and each shattering wave sends prismatic shards flying outward.  They never cut you; as they drift near, the shards accelerate into butterflies, wings etched with fractal skylines.  They land on your shoulders, impossibly light.  Each butterfly is one of your former definitions of success, and they rest now not as weights but as decorations, free to leave whenever a breeze chooses.

Far out on the glittering water rises an island shaped like an open hand: five finger-ridges, a palm-valley.  Something urges you to travel there, but instead of summoning a boat you decide to test this open relationship with reality you’ve been practicing.  “Carry me,” you invite without clarifying who should do the carrying.  Instantly the cliff peels away and curls beneath your feet into a paper crane, folding and folding until you stand upon its broad origami back.  With a single downstroke the crane takes flight, trailing crystalline spray.  It deposits you in the palm-valley, then folds itself into nothing—an unceremonious poof of origami dust.

In the center of the island grows a tree whose leaves are mirrors polished so bright you can stare into them without seeing your own face—because they do not show the present, only possibilities.  One leaf flickers with a life where you became exactly what your parents expected; another trembles with a version where every romance lasted forever but never taught you to grow; still another shines with the future you have not yet dared to imagine.  The leaves chime softly when the wind hums through them, a lullaby of Maybe.  At the base of the trunk is a knothole pulsing like a second heart.  You kneel, press your ear to it, and hear—not words, but a sensation, a warmth that translates itself into meaning: The map you sketched on scraps of yearning is not the territory.  You are free to redraw anything.

A gentle quake ripples through the dreamscape.  The sky-gears pause, the mirror-leaves still.  You sense the border of wakefulness approaching—the faraway alarm clock in the non-dream world is flickering on like a red star on the horizon.  But instead of scrambling to hoard insights before daylight erases them, you plant your palms into the moon-rich soil and speak a final intention: Let whatever is true stay, let whatever is expectation transform.

The tree exhales a single mirrored leaf, and it settles onto your palm.  Instead of reflections, its surface now shows pure, unbroken silver—unknown, unwritten, wide as possibility.  You tuck it behind your ear like an ornament.  When your eyes flutter open in the physical bedroom, a phantom coolness lingers at your temple, and somewhere in your chest an invisible gear has quietly, decisively disengaged.

You stretch, whisper “Thank you,” and begin the day, lighter by the weight of several lifetimes’ worth of Should.
