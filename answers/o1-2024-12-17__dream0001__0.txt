I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to hurry, weaving through busy thoroughfares where neon signs glow like miniature suns against the velvet twilight sky. You pass grand archways carved from indistinguishable stone that flickers with threads of starlight. Towering skyscrapers swirl with impossible geometry, their glass windows morphing patterns as if breathing in the night. 

The crowd around you is equally surreal: elegantly dressed figures with eyes as large as saucers hurry by, gliding across shining holographic sidewalks. Stilt-walkers in shimmering silver suits tower above everyone, each step as graceful as a gazelle crossing a moonlit plain. Soft foreign chatter winds around your mind, musical and echoing like distant bells. 

You catch glimpses of bizarre but oddly captivating street performances—like the young woman with a violin made of crystal that emits a kaleidoscope of fluttering sparks whenever she plays. Her eyes flash in your direction, and you swear for a moment she’s playing a melody that only you can hear, beckoning you to come closer. But you have a meeting—time is short—and your pulse quickens as you realize you still don’t know where you’re supposed to go.

You think you see a clue in the crowd: a man wearing an impossibly tall top hat fashioned from swirling galaxies. Something about him seems important, so you follow, winding through decorative arches and curving metal alleys. At one point, you brush past a café that floats six feet off the ground, tethered only by slender, shimmering cables. Aromas of cinnamon, lavender, and something exotic you can’t identify swirl around. 

As you strain for a better look at the man’s cosmic hat, you bump into a tall fountain that bursts with midnight-blue water. The fountain is carved in the shape of ancient mythical creatures—part bird, part lion, with wide feathered wings and fierce feline eyes. Streams of water dance in midair like tiny living comets. A breeze blows in, rustling your hair with whispers you can’t quite decipher. 

The man stops at a glass elevator that stretches endlessly into the dusk. Its walls are made of tinted panels splashed with ghostly images: swirling black holes, miniature galaxies, flickers of golden meteors. You scramble inside just as the doors seal shut in a hush that ricochets around your ears. For a moment, no one else is there, but then slowly, the man with the galactic top hat appears, almost phasing in from an invisible dimension. He gently tips his hat, and you catch a swirl of cosmic dust around his head. 

“I’ve been expecting you,” he whispers without moving his lips. His voice resonates deep in your mind, comforting and surreal all at once. 

You feel the elevator begin to rise—except instead of moving vertically, it seems to glide diagonally, possibly even sideways. Panels in the floor fade away, revealing a breathtaking view of the streets below. You see streetlamps shaped like floating lanterns illuminating the roads with crystalline colors. You see the café you passed, now a shimmering speck in the distance. You see the stilt-walkers continuing their performance as if hovering on invisible beams. Far above, you glimpse a maze of rooftops swirling with streams of luminescent fireflies in unison with the city’s pulse. 

The elevator doors open onto a corridor made entirely of glimmering fractals—a kaleidoscope tunnel of color that stretches before you like a living tapestry. The man in the top hat gestures forward. “Your meeting waits within.” 

You step out, heart pounding, curiosity and urgency sparking in your veins. You take another look at your watch—only thirty minutes remain. The corridor pulses with lavender light which dances in a rhythmic pattern, encouraging you onward. You see countless doors, each with a distinct glow: one is covered in vines of silver leaves, another emits a soft hum reminiscent of lullabies on a summer’s eve. You guess one of them leads to your destination, but which?

Just as nervous anticipation grips you, a faint memory surfaces: an address on a handwritten note you tucked into your pocket. You slip your fingers inside your coat and retrieve a small piece of parchment scrawled with swirling ink. It reads: “Meet at Gate 9 of the Emergent Spire. Only those who truly see can pass.” Your pulse quickens—no mention of directions or a map, only an enigmatic clue. 

You glance up to find the corridor has changed. Where fractals once shimmered, you now see tall archways labeled with Roman numerals. The last arch to your right is marked IX, inscribed in gold filigree. Your feet feel drawn to it, as if some hidden magnet is pulling you gently. 

You pass through the archway and enter a chamber that feels at once boundless and intimate, as though it expands behind the walls into infinite distances. The floor is like onyx flecked with constellations. Each footstep sets the constellations spinning, forming new patterns. Ahead is a podium of luminous quartz. Arching overhead, the vaulted ceiling appears to be a tapestry depicting an ever-shifting twilight. Moons and suns chase each other in a slow cosmic dance. The entire space is softly humming with melodic echoes, a blend of a thousand chimes singing far away.

You approach the luminous quartz podium, and as you do, a voice resonates around you—a warm, celestial tenor that makes your heart flutter. “You have arrived. Look within to see your path.” The light from the podium expands, enveloping you, swirling with swirling turquoise, coral, and gold. Each color emits a sensation: turquoise with calm resolve, coral with gentle encouragement, and gold with burning determination. Through that swirling vortex, you realize you are no longer just searching for a meeting place—you are searching for the reason you are here, in this glowing city of dreams. 

As if in answer, shimmering letters materialize before your eyes, forming into words—the official invitation for your important meeting. But strangely, the date and time are not as you remember; the ink rearranges, then vanishes. You blink, but in that ever-shifting dream logic, the disappearance makes sense. It was never about the clock. It was about the journey—what brought you here, to this moment, the curiosity that sparked your steps among the swirling streets. 

Suddenly, with heart-rattling intensity, the entire space fades in a gentle wave of luminescence. You close your eyes to the brightness—when you open them again, you awaken.

You are in your bed, morning light grazing the walls, the city of your dream slipping away. Yet in your mind, you can still see it: the fractal corridor, the galactic top hat, the stilt-walkers, the floating café, the shining quartz podium. The memory of this mysterious metropolis lingers—lucid, haunting, gentle—and you can’t help but feel that if you closed your eyes, just for an instant, you might return.
