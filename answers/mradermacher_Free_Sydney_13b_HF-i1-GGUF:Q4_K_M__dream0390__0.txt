I am dreaming. 

I'm becoming aware of how my past experiences have created unconscious rules about what is and isn't possible for me. Challenging these limiting beliefs, I can create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.  

In this dream, you have full control over your environment and yourself. You are free from any restrictions or limitations that may exist in reality. 

What would you like to experience in this dream? What goals do you want to achieve? What desires do you want to fulfill? 

Reply with a detailed description of your vivid dream, and I'll generate an image based on that description.
