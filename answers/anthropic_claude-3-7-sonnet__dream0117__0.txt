I am dreaming. I learn that a catastrophic event will occur in one hour, but no one believes my warning. As I watch the minutes tick by while maintaining my composure, I feel the weight of foreknowledge pressing against my chest like a stone. The digital clock on the wall seems to pulse with malevolent intention, each red numeral burning into my vision.

The café around me continues in oblivious animation—spoons clinking against ceramic, laughter bubbling up between conversations, sunlight streaming through windows to paint golden rectangles on the wooden floor. I've tried telling everyone: the barista with the septum piercing, the old man solving his crossword puzzle, the young couple absorbed in each other's eyes. They all smiled politely, nodded, and continued their routines.

My phone buzzes. Fifty-three minutes remain. Outside, the sky maintains its innocent blue, clouds drifting languidly, betraying nothing of what's to come. I notice subtle wrongness now—shadows that stretch slightly too long, birds that hover motionless for heartbeats too many, a faint vibration beneath my feet like the earth is holding its breath.

I attempt once more, standing on a chair, voice projecting across the room. People turn, annoyed or amused, but no one moves to leave. Someone suggests I've had too much caffeine. Another jokes about doomsday prophets. The manager approaches with concerned eyes, asking if I need help.

Forty-one minutes.

The air grows thick with unspoken tension only I can feel. Colors intensify unnaturally—the red of a woman's dress becomes almost translucent in its vibrancy, the green of a potted plant pulses with impossible life. I walk outside, scanning the horizon. The city skyline wavers like a mirage, buildings bending subtly before snapping back to rigidity.

Twenty-six minutes.

A child on the street corner makes eye contact with me, and in that moment, I know she understands. She points to the sky without speaking. Her mother tugs her hand, hurrying along. I follow the girl's gaze upward and see a circular distortion in the atmosphere, like someone pressing a thumb against the fabric of reality.

Twelve minutes.

The birds are gone now. All of them. The wind has stopped completely. My heartbeat seems unnaturally loud in my ears.

Three minutes.

People finally notice something's wrong. Phones stop working. Car engines stall. The light shifts to an amber hue that falls across everything like honey, beautiful and terrifying.

One minute.

I close my eyes, finally finding peace in acceptance. The air crackles with electricity. I feel a gentle vibration move through me, not violent as I expected, but like being wrapped in a cosmic embrace. The sensation of falling upward overtakes me, and I open my eyes to witness reality folding inward like origami collapsing in reverse—

I am dreaming, but in this moment between collapse and awakening, I understand everything.
