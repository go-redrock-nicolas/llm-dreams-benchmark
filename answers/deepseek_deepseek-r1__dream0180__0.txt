I am dreaming. <placeholderno5>

I stand at the edge of a glowing, iridescent lake, its surface shimmering like crushed opal under twin moons—one ivory, one lavender—that hang low in a starlit sky. The air hums with the faint, melodic thrum of unseen beings, harmonizing in a language that shapes the mist into fleeting, humanoid figures. They bow as they dissolve, their evanescent forms rippling with echoed laughter.

Around me, towering structures spiral upward, their walls alive with bioluminescent vines that pulse in rhythm with the music. The people here move like water—fluid, precise, their gestures a dance of extended fingers and tilted chins. I mimic them clumsily, my limbs heavy, my heartbeat a discordant drum. 

A woman approaches, her gown woven from what looks like liquid shadow, stitched with threads of silver light. She offers me a sphere of glass filled with swirling smoke, her eyes elongated and star-flecked, unblinking. I take it, as others have done, but when the smoke inside forms a snarling wraith, I gasp and drop it. The sphere shatters. Silence falls. The music stops.

The lake’s glow dims. The vines wither. The woman’s face fractures into sorrow as the moons bleed from their edges, darkening like dying coals. The ground quakes, and whispers rise: *You fed fear to the sacred void. Now it feeds on you.* 

Beneath my feet, the earth splits. I fall into a chasm where the smoke-wraith waits, its form now colossal, ravenous. It laughs with the voices of everyone I’ve ever known, all asking, *Why didn’t you learn the steps?* 

Then—I wake. But my hands still shimmer with opal dust, and the twin moons linger behind my eyelids, half-eclipsed.
