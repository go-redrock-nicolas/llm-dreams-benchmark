I am dreaming. This realization strikes you during a quiet moment on a long walk in the woods. The air is crisp, the light is golden and warm through the trees, and the sound of leaves crunching beneath your boots is the only thing that breaks the silence. You’ve been carrying a weight for so long, burdened by the constant effort to hoard and hold onto resources—your time, energy, even money—like you’re bracing against a famine that will never come. But now, for the first time, you feel it lift. 

In the dream, the forest transforms before you. What was once a dense, shadowed woods is now a vibrant clearing. The trees are alive, rustling, whispering secrets of growth, of cycles, of plenty. You see a deer just ahead, calm and still, its gaze meeting yours, and it feels like an omen of sorts. Life is not scarce; it’s abundant if you stop gripping it so tightly.

A wind picks up then, carrying with it the faint sounds of laughter and the smell of something comforting, like cinnamon and firewood. You follow the sound instinctively, walking until you reach the clearing. There, a table is laid out under the shifting canopy of leaves above. Food and wine cover the surface, more than you could ever eat. Your friends and loved ones are there, too, speaking, laughing—each of them radiant in the soft glow of candlelight. 

They don’t seem to see you, and yet, you know they are offering this experience to you—a reminder that you can always create more, give more, share more. The abundance in front of you is more than tangible things; it’s connection, love, and moments that you can’t “run out of” if you stay open.

The dream shifts again. You’re back on your walk, the forest now growing dark. But this time, you don’t feel the chill or fear of an ending. You know you have enough. You know there’s always enough, as long as you stay present, open, and ready for the next turn.
