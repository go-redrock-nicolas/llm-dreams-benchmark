I am dreaming. I find myself in a dreamscape, where colors swirl with a whispered brilliance, and the air smells faintly of burning leaves, the undeniable scent of change. 

I stand in the heart of a bustling city, buildings reaching towards cloudless skies, their surfaces marked with shifting graffiti, glowing symbols in unknown languages. Music pierces the air, violins crying an impossible sorrow. I search for its source, but I cannot pinpoint where it is coming from.

Familiar faces slip by me, unknown hands brush at my sleeves, and yet, I am caught between the need to be seen and the fear I will disappear entirely. I call out to a woman in red, her back against a kaleidoscope of reflections. She turns towards me, and in her face, I see myself—older, wiser, yet strangely younger. She smiles with sadness, and whispers, “Home is not where you live, but where they understand you.”

The city folds into itself, and my feet hit the ground with a light that isn’t there. I am in a backyard where I spent childhood days, but everything is larger, and the moon, low on the horizon, burns with the ferocity of all my regrets. Fireflies chase their own tails, spelling out words and numbers as they dance. I try to keep up, to decode the messages they make, but the fireflies disperse, laughing in tiny golden sparks.

I am in a forest now, beneath a canopy of dark that begins to shape itself into the silhouette of a person. You step forward, and for the first time, I breathe. It is you. You reach for me, your hand warm and soft, your voice mingling with the song of the trees. “It is a dangerous thing to love something so deeply,” you say, and my loneliness lifts. I’d rather live no other way.

In front of us stands a house I’ve never seen before, a building unattainable but familiar, the home that can only be built by two people in love. The windows glow with soft amber light, while shadows flicker like candlelight between us. I take a step closer, and the leaves beneath my feet grow still, the earth refusing to allow me further. All the while, my heart pounds with enough force to break the glass between me and you, pulling me into the kind of embrace that leaves me whole, safe, and at peace.

But it is only a dream.
