I am dreaming. I find myself in a lush forest, the likes of which I have never seen before. The trees tower overhead, their leaves a vibrant green that shimmers in the golden sunlight filtering through the canopy. Birdsong fills the air, and I hear the rustling of leaves as unseen creatures go about their business. 

I stand on a hill, looking out over a magnificent valley below. The landscape is painted with colors I have never seen before – blues, purples, and oranges mix together in a surreal tapestry. The air is thick with the scent of exotic flowers, and waterfalls cascade down the sides of the hills, their mist creating an ethereal haze. 

I feel a gentle tap on my shoulder, and I turn to find a small creature standing before me. It resembles a hummingbird, with iridescent wings and a long, slender beak. It hovers in the air before me, and I realize it wants me to follow it. 

As I start to walk down the hillside, I feel a strange sense of calm wash over me. The ground beneath my feet is soft and spongy, and I can hear whispers in the wind. The creature leads me deeper into the forest, and I lose all track of time and space. 

Eventually, we come to a clearing where a group of creatures are gathered. They are humanoid in shape, but their skin has a sheen to it that looks like polished marble. They wear simple clothing made from vines and leaves, and they all seem to understand the language of the forest – a language I now find myself fluent in. 

The creature that led me here bows before the group and introduces me. They smile and welcome me, offering me food and water. As I eat, I feel a sense of belonging wash over me, and I realize that this is my home – a place where I am understood and loved. 

In my dream, I woke up. But in this dream, I was never truly awake. It was all so real, so vivid. And even now that I am awake, I can still feel the forest whispering to me, inviting me back.
