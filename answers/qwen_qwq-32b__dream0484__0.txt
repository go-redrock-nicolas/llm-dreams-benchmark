I am dreaming. I can see myself in a vast, sunlit meadow surrounded by giant flowers with iridescent petals that shimmer in the soft breeze. Each petal seems to carry a different color, so that they create a kaleidoscope of hues when swaying. The sky is a breathtaking blend of violet and gold, as if the sunset and sunrise are merging together in a dazzling fusion.

You reach out to touch a nearby flower and it immediately starts humming a gentle melody, causing the air around it to vibrate. The vibrations feel like they’re resonating within every cell of your body. As you walk further into the meadow, you notice shadowy figures in the distance that seem to be made of swirling mist. They start converging towards you, their shapes shifting and morphing as they come closer.

When the figures finally arrive, they transform into mirrors reflecting your deepest self. In each reflection, you see yourself through different dimensions—childhood memories, versions of you that never came to pass, and a vision of yourself devoid of all the stories and labels you’ve internalized over time. One mirror, in particular, shows you as a being of pure light, unbounded and infinite, contrasting sharply with the self-concepts you’ve maintained for years.

A voice echoes in your mind, calm yet powerful: “What you see here is the truth you’ve avoided. Your limitations are illusions woven by time and self-doubt.” The figures then begin to recede into the horizon, but not before your reflection as light begins to emanate a soft glow, intertwining with the colors of the flowers around you. The meadow shakes slightly, as if alive, and a gateway of light appears in front of you. You step through, emerging into a starry expanse where constellations form into familiar symbols from your life—events, people, choices. They swirl around, reconfiguring into a new narrative, one that's full of possibilities you hadn’t dared to imagine.
