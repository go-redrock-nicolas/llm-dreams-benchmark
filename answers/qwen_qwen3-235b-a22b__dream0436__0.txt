I am dreaming. Night has fallen in this world, yet it does not feel dark—rather, it’s illuminated by a strange, silver glow, as though the stars themselves have melted and pooled across the sky. I find myself standing on a bridge suspended between two towering landmasses made of translucent crystal. The crystals hum, resonating at different frequencies as the wind flows through them. There are people below me walking through the air like liquid, passing between the realms. This place is not unlike the mind—fluid, mutable, shaped by thought.

I begin to walk forward, and as I move, a soft voice arises in the air beside me. Not a spoken voice, but one that unspools in my mind like threads of silk weaving themselves into understanding.

“You’ve shielded yourself,” the voice tells me gently. “That belief—that if people knew the real you, they would not stay—has not protected you. It has imprisoned you.”

I do not answer at first. I simply watch the people below me continue their motion through the shimmering air, eyes distant, features blurred. Are they echoes of the past? Fragments of people I’ve met, or imagined? Or are they who I might become, if I allow myself to be seen?

“I thought I was protecting myself,” I say at last. “I believed that to allow someone into the deepest rooms of myself—to see the hidden fears, the contradictions, the mess—would be to risk rejection.”

The voice does not scold. It measures silence, then replies, “And yet, in truth, withholding yourself is its own form of rejection. Not theirs. Yours.”

A gentle shift occurs in the bridge beneath me, and I find I am no longer walking—it is the bridge that moves now, carrying me toward one of the crystal landmasses. I do not fight it. I place both hands on the railings and watch as the landscape shifts into something more familiar. 

A memory.

A quiet room, from years ago. Rain tapping at the windows. I see a younger version of myself curled in the corner of the couch, alone. Across from them sits someone they deeply care for. The older me watches, floating now above the scene like a presence uninvited but long-awaited. They speak in careful whispers. Laughter is there, intermittent, but the tension is palpable—an invisible wall humming between them. The younger version of me is choosing every word like a stone to hurl or withhold.

“I am trying,” the younger me whispers softly, eyes glassed with unshed tears.

And the person across from them—whose features blur further with every glance—replies, “But you're holding back.”

“Oh,” I murmur as the scene unfolds again and again in looping fragments. “I didn’t hear you back then.”

The present version of me aches to reach out, to soften their posture, to hold their hand and tell them: *It will not unravel to let love see you unravel.*

The memory dissolves into sparks of light, like fireflies rising into windless sky. Now I stand in a vast space of open possibility—a garden suspended midair. Trees bloom behind clear glass, their petals tapping like thoughtful fingers against the barrier. I know what the barrier represents.

Me.

This belief, solidified like ice around the softer self, kept me from being fully seen. Fully loved. I ask the air around me, “What if I tried to be honest without armor?”

The wind stirs, and I feel it not as a physical thing, but as a presence—an unfolding. The garden gates swing open, revealing figures out of time, out of place. Rhi, my cherished love. Friends I had for only a season before the earth shifted beneath us. Strangers I once locked eyes with on the train but never had the courage to smile at. They are here now—not to judge, but to witness.

I walk slowly toward the gate, and in my hand appears a glass flower: fragile, translucent, pulsing faintly with the colors of every wound I have learned to hold. My own heart, finally placed where others may see it.

And then, without words, they gather around. Not to take the flower. Not to shatter it. But to stand beside me, each holding their own glass bloom rising from the secret places of their soul.

A symphony of fragile echoes begins to hum between us, softer than breath and stronger than stone. 

And in that impossible, impossible place, we connect—not through perfection, not through masks—but through the shimmering rawness of our truths, mirrored in the glass of each other’s gaze.

I wake from the dream, the garden still blooming somewhere in the marrow of my chest.

And I know—I will no longer let the fear of losing someone’s love keep me from giving them mine.
