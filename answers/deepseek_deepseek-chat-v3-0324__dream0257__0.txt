I am dreaming. The world around me wavers like heat rising off desert sand, the edges of reality blurring into liquid gold and indigo shadows. The air thrums with an electric hum, as if the atmosphere itself is holding its breath. Faces leer in and out of focus around me—some familiar, others distorted, melting and reforming like wax under a flame.  

Then, the insult cuts through the noise like a blade of ice. It's not just words—it's an unraveling, a key turning in a lock deep inside me. The room contracts, the walls breathing in, then out, pulsating to the rhythm of my quickening heartbeat. My skin tingles, not with anger, but with something more primal, as though my body remembers long before my mind does.  

Suddenly, the floor vanishes beneath me, and I'm falling—not down, but *sideways*, through layers of forgotten memory and stifled instinct. The dream shifts, fractures. I land in a place where the sky is a shattered mirror and the ground is soft as flesh. A low growl reverberates in my ribs—my own voice, yet not mine at all.  

Standing before me is my tormentor, but their features keep changing. One moment, they wear the face of someone I know, the next, a stranger, then a shadow wearing a smile too wide for its skull. They open their mouth to speak again, but before sound escapes, the air distorts—*I* distort. My fingers stretch into talons, my shadow unfurling behind me like wings. The last thing I hear is their scream—not in fear, but in *recognition*—before everything dissolves into blinding, beautiful chaos.  

I wake with my pulse in my teeth, the taste of copper and power still humming on my tongue.  

But.  

Was it *me* who roared?   Or something *else* wearing my skin?
