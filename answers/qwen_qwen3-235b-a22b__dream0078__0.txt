I am dreaming. The air is saturated with the scent of old parchment and ozone, and the only sound amidst the cacophony of spinning ideas is my shallow breath.

I find myself suspended in a cathedral-like space, its walls lined with towering shelves of forgotten tomes. Each whisper of their pages is a language lost to time, and above me, too far to touch, blue lightning dances across stone arches as if alive, powering the glowing, translucent panels hovering in midair.

In front of me is the font of my burden—a great, obsidian lectern cradling a single ancient manuscript. Its cover is carved with sigils that shimmer and shift as if they were alive, reshaping their meaning with every passing second. My hand hovers over it, fingers tingling with the unknown script’s latent energy. It is not ink on paper—it’s like thought carved into reality, digits of a forgotten consciousness bleeding into mine.

Overhead, the screens—dozens of them, ethereal projections casting a cool, blue radiance—flash with chaotic streams of information. Numbers tick by too fast to register, data plots spike and fracture, and strange diagrams rotate in 11-dimensional patterns I can barely tolerate let alone comprehend. Data is not neutral; I feel it watching me. Listening.

As my vision scans one of the panels, I see heat fluctuations in cities a thousand miles away. A heartbeat graph indicates anomalies glowing, a red pulse hammering in tandem with some hidden chaos. Another screen shows a star chart being retorted by something—no, someone—manipulating nebulae like strands of thought in a cosmic tapestry.

My mind, stretched between scanning millennia-old glyphs and sifting through an infinite torrent of changing code, begins to hum. The weight of the dream is not in fear or danger, but in urgency. A mission that predates even memory entrusted to me. 

The script in the manuscript pulsates. Slowly, the letters realign into something readable—briefly—but before I can lock onto the meaning, they dissolve again into a scenery of shifting celestial symbols, hints of a forgotten tongue older than Earth. I lean closer, trying to translate sound into meaning, and feel heat build behind my eyes.

A low chime reverberates through the air. A warning, subtle but ironclad. I look up just in time to watch one of the screens cycle through breaking point—lines fracturing from order into chaos. There's a collapsing timeline in front of me, different futures burning like paper caught in flame. Time is folding.

I must decide—give myself fully to uncover the truth buried in the ancient tome, or abandon the mystery of the past to avert the catastrophe unfolding in the present forged from the digital streams. But both carry equal weight. To let go of one is to lose the other.

The lightning overhead intensifies. In the margins of the great book, a glyph blinks in rhythm with my heartbeat—a foreign word that feels intimate, like my own name in some primal dialect of the universe. It seems to call to me, beckoning me forward.

That is when I realize I am not the dreamer—I am the dream.

And both futures depend on me waking up.
