I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering abyss, the void stretching out before me like an infinite, formless canvas. Here, the laws of physics seem to take a coffee break, for I am levitating, my feet inches above an otherworldly landscape that seems to shift and change with each Passing thought.

Suddenly, a creature drifts into view. It resembles a jellyfish, but where there should be transparent gelatinous tissue, instead, it's composed of swirling galaxies, pulsating with cosmic energy. I raise an eyebrow, because of course, when you're floating on the edge of the abyss, you'd expect no less than a celestial jellyfish.

"Well, isn't this a pickle," I quip, trying to maintain my cool despite the surreal situation. "I've had fantasies involving seafood, but this is a bit too 'interstellar' for my tastes."

The creature doesn't respond, just continues its eerie, graceful dance through the astral plane. I, however, can't help but feel a pang of sadness. Something about its silent, ethereal journey strikes a chord within me. It reminder s me of a time when I felt ethereal too, untethered, unbound by the mundane.

"Oh, don't look at me like that," I retort, my voice cracking slightly as the joke dies on my lips. "You're making me all sentimental, and you know I can't handle that. It's like experiencing a week's worth of emotions crammed into a single instant."

The cosmic creature pauses, its galaxy eyes staring deep into my soul. I swallow hard, trying to push back the wave of emotion threatening to consume me. "Okay, okay," I concede, "maybe humor isn't the best defense mechanism after all. Maybe, just this once, I should face whatever's making me feel like this without trying to deflect it with jokes."

With that, the creature seems to nod, its galactic form pulsing gently before continuing its journey. I take a deep breath, the abyss suddenly feeling less daunting, more like an old friend waiting patiently for me to join its dance. And so, I step off the edge, ready to confront my inner demons, one cosmic jellyfish at a time.
