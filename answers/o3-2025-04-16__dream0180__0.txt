I am dreaming. I am dreaming—though the dream feels as crisp and convincing as the air before a summer storm.  

I open my eyes onto a city suspended like a chandelier in the twilight. Buildings dangle from invisible tethers: alabaster spires, crescent-shaped balconies, bridgeways looped with silver vines that hum softly as commuters drift along them in pairs. Gravity seems to have been politely rewritten; I can step onto a vertical street and walk up its side as though it were the gentlest slope.

In this place, relationships are choreographed ballets. People greet one another with gestures so intricate they resemble calligraphy performed in three-dimensional space. Partners trace spirals in the air around each other’s hearts, friends exchange miniature music boxes that chime a single shared note, elders and children press foreheads together while breathing the same breath three times. Even strangers circle one another clockwise before speaking, orbiting in perfect silence like moons verifying each other’s gravity.

Every gesture matters. A misplaced angle of the wrist can suggest rivalry; a poorly timed bow may announce an unintended proposal. I spend the first hours of the dream silently copying what I see: the tilt of a chin, the half-second of eye contact, the precise moment to reveal a smile. My lungs fill with scarlet lantern light, and for a while I feel I am passing as native.

But dreams tempt with hidden trapdoors.

At dusk, the city hosts the Festival of Constellations. People gather in the floating amphitheater—an enormous disc of translucent stone that glows from within like a moon made of milk. Each attendee receives a slim, opalescent ribbon. The ritual, I learn, is to thread the ribbon through another person’s fingers in a pattern that mirrors a chosen star cluster, silently acknowledging the bond you share. Lovers choose Orion, siblings trade Cygnus, strangers politely offer faint, unnamed clusters with shy smiles.

I find myself face-to-face with a woman wearing robes the color of new leaves. Her eyes are pools of still water reflecting the first evening stars. She extends her ribbon: cobalt shot through with sparks of gold—a pattern I’ve never seen offered to anyone else. An unspoken hush ripples through the amphitheater. I sense the air waiting. I sense I should know what to do.

Panicking beneath my calm façade, I recall the swirl-and-loop technique used by acquaintances. I reproduce it carefully, threading her ribbon through my fingers, weaving a small, polite constellation. A sigh—not of relief, but of horror—washes across the crowd. A hundred hands freeze mid-gesture. Music boxes fall silent. Stars overhead flicker like startled eyes.

The cobalt-and-gold ribbon, it seems, is reserved for the most sacred of ties: the spiritual promise between two souls who will shepherd one another through rebirths. To answer it with a pattern meant for casual acquaintance is to tear the fabric of expectation—worse, to declare her destiny trivial.

The amphitheater’s floating stone begins to tremble. The silver vines above us coil like serpents. A low, resonant bell thrums beneath my sternum though no bell is visible. Guardians step from the shadows—tall figures clad in mirrored masks that reflect not my face but my every past mistake, glimmering in an infinity of echoes.

My instinct is to flee, but the air itself holds me—thick as honey, humming with consequence. The woman with the leaf-green robes regards me, eyes soft yet shimmering with something older than fury: disappointment braided with cosmic grief.

She lifts both hands. Around her fingertips, the world’s color drains until only her ribbon retains its pigments. She touches my forehead, and suddenly I tumble backward through memories that are not mine: volcanic islands splitting the sea, apes discovering fire in dark caves, the first script scratched into drying clay. Each scene features two silhouettes—always companions, guardians, siblings of the soul. She has carried that ribbon through millennia, seeking the promised other half.

And I, ignorant dream-wanderer, have carelessly unlaced the knot.

Yet another pulse reverberates—like a heart deciding something. The leaf-green woman’s disappointment shifts into measured calm. The crowd’s tension loosens, though the silence remains unbroken. She lifts the ribbon again, tears it lengthwise with a single decisive motion, and ties half of it to my wrist. The gold sparks crawl over my skin like curious fireflies. Then she performs a new pattern—one I recognize from observation: the Gesture of Teaching.

For the city’s hidden laws state there is refuge for an honest foreigner who has sinned without intent: you must submit to “the Path of Relearning.” Seven trials, seven dawns.

First Dawn: I must stand on a balcony that rotates with the constellations. For every misnamed star, a gust of wind pushes me one step closer to the edge, but correct identifications pull me inward. My pulse beats as bright as the morning star by the time I finish, toes still anchored to stone.

Second Dawn: I must taste an herb for every emotion I have caused another to feel. Bitterness for her sorrow. Scalding heat for her surprise. Sweet rain for any flicker of awe. By the end my tongue knows the weight of her heart.

Third Dawn: I must navigate the Labyrinth of the Unfinished Gesture, corridors shaped like incomplete greetings. Each turn asks me to finish a movement flawlessly, or walls of crystal mirror my hesitation.

Fourth Dawn: I carry a vessel of lantern light across the hushed marketplace, offering apology through radiance rather than words. Half the merchants avert their eyes; the other half nod, their forgiveness pooling quietly in their pupils.

Fifth Dawn: I watch children mimic the entire ribbon ritual in playful innocence—no fear of taboo, only laughter. I realize rules exist not to imprison wonder but to safeguard it.

Sixth Dawn: I dream within the dream: her ribbon transforms into a quill that writes my name in the sky, then erases it, teaching me humility’s paradox—that being known fully means accepting the possibility of being forgotten.

Seventh Dawn: I return to the amphitheater. The city gathers again, wide wings of silk banners catching sunrise. The woman stands opposite me, half-ribbon on her wrist, the other half on mine. This time I bow not just with my torso but with every invisible hinge of spirit. I spread the ribbon between us, let it hang like a bridge, and wait.

She steps forward, weaving a new constellation—one invented in this moment, unknown even to the ancient charts. It sparkles into being above our heads: two wandering stars, once lost, now tracing the same orbit. The amphitheater exhales a single collective note—neither triumph nor condemnation, but the sound of a page turning.

The floating city brightens, vines uncurl into blossoms, and the mirrored Guardians lower their masks. In their reflections I no longer see my missteps; I see a corridor of future possibilities.

I wake—yet the severed half-ribbon remains tied around my wrist, faint cobalt glimmer flickering whenever I reach out to greet the day.
