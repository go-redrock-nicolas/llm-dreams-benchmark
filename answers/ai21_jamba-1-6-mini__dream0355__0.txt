I am dreaming.

In this dream, I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, uncharted forest. The air is thick with the earthy scent of moss and damp bark, and the light filters through the canopy in deep, verdant shades of green. The forest beckons me with an unnatural allure, as though it knows something about me that I myself do not.

I step forward, the leaves crunching beneath my bare feet. Each step sends shivers up my spine, as if the feeling beneath gives me life and yet warns of danger. The trees are ancient, their gnarled trunks twisted with the signs of countless years, and their roots seem to grasp at the earth like clenched fists. A thick, misty fog blankets the forest floor, obscuring my view beyond a few feet.

My heart pounds in my chest as I navigate the uneven terrain. Vines coil around my ankles, pulling me deeper into the labyrinthine woods. The dense undergrowth is alive with the sounds of unseen creatures—chirping crickets, croaking frogs, and the distant hoot of an owl. Though I hear them, I see nothing, and the solitude is eerie, yet strangely comforting.

Suddenly, the mist parts, revealing a glimmering lake. The water's surface is as smooth as glass, reflecting the moonlight in a kaleidoscope of shimmering silver. The rim of the lake is lined with smooth stones, each gleaming with the sheen of the moon, as though they were polished just for this moment.

I feel a sudden, inexplicable urge to reach down and dip my hand into the cool water. As soon as my fingers touch the surface, the entire lake is stirred, like a great beast waking from deep slumber. The water ripples and churns, an inky blackness swirling around my arm. I pull my hand back, feeling a faint remnant of a pull, as if the lake wants me to delve deeper.

I peer into the depths. That brief moment of contact seems to have bridged some chasm within me. The vague, fleeting impression of an ancient, wordless voice whispers to me, its message indistinct yet powerful. The voice seems to be an old knowledge, a memory of mine long forgotten yet hardly lost.

I can feel the pull again, this time much stronger. The forest crackles with the energy of an approaching storm. The trees sway and groan around me, their branches reaching for the sky as though they are trying to break through it. I take a few steps back, only to stumble upon something hard and unyielding.

Looking back, I see a raised platform of stone. It’s covered in carved symbols that seem to shift and move as I gaze upon them. Their meaning escapes me, yet I feel as though I’ve seen these markings before—in another dream, maybe, or in the fleeting images of a half-forgotten memory.

At the center of the platform lies a stone pedestal, adorned with what appears to be an ancient, unblemished jade censor. The smoke that rises from it is a pale green, scented with a familiar yet forgotten aroma. I reach out to touch it without hesitation, my fingers resonating with the sense of an ancient ritual, though I know no such ritual exists in my waking life.

The smoke spirals away in a haze, taking with it the last remnants of the earlier stillness. I am left with a lingering warmth and an almost electric sense of clarity. It feels like the forest knows me, understands something deep within me that I can only sense in fragments.

Suddenly, the ground shakes. The mist dissolves, and the trees around me begin to sway with unnatural force. The once-serene lake begins to boil, and the serene face of the moon is twisted by dark clouds that churn in the sky. The storm is here.

The pulse of the dream intensifies. I know I must act—but what? The mist clears, and a figure stands before me. It’s human-like but not entirely so. Tall, with a regal air, it is wrapped in robes that flow like water, yet its face is hidden by a shifting, spectral mask.

"You have come far, my friend," the figure says, its voice a deep, resonant echo. "But you have not yet found what you seek."

I feel the ground beneath me shift, and suddenly I am no longer standing but floating, rising above the forest canopy. The stillness of the forest, once comforting, now presses down on me, and I am aware of the tremendous weight of the dream, of the ancient truths that I have ignored but now must confront.

And then, darkness.

In that final, fleeting moment of clarity before the dream fades, I feel both an overwhelming sense of unease and an unusual awakening. I know, in my heart, that the dream was a mirror, a reflection of all that I am—and all that I have yet to become.
