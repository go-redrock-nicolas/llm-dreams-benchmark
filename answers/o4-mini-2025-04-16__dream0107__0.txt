I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You find yourself seated on a throne carved of moonstone and ivory, high above an endless void whose edges swirl with nebulae—brilliant purples, molten golds, and whispering emeralds that shift like living paint. Before you stand two colossal figures of impossible scale. One is a being of crackling starlight, its limbs trailing constellations that pulse and dissolve with every breath. The other is woven from living shadow, its form folding into itself so that each movement births tiny universes at its fingertips. Between them stretches a long, iridescent dais where their advocates pace, each word they speak rippling outward as luminous ripples across a lake of darkness.  

This is your courtroom. Its walls are woven from threads of time, every filament humming with the echoes of past verdicts. The air tastes of silver ozone and distant laughter. In your hand rests a gavel carved from a shard of the first sunrise—light itself trapped in crystal. You know that your decision will reshape the fundamental laws of such worlds as yet unborn.  

At first argument, the Starlight Entity’s envoy unfurls a tapestry of cause and effect: galaxies spun into existence by its will, civilizations rising on planets bathed in its radiance. You see entire eras flash before your eyes—the birth of binary suns, the first whisper of life in tidal pools, the slow dance of cosmic dust coalescing into new realms of possibility. Their voice resonates like a choir of quasars, each syllable a supernova of conviction.  

Then the Shadow Being’s counsel speaks. From their fingertips bloom tendrils of darkness so dense they swallow glimpses of the nebulae beyond. Within those voids you glimpse hidden truths: the necessity of endings, the fertile hush in which new beginnings germinate. You feel its argument in the hollow between your ribs—a quiet that allows wonder to take shape. Their words arrive on the hush of deep space, weightless but undeniable.  

As the final arguments conclude, you rise from your throne. The gavel in your hand pulses—each heartbeat resonates through the courtroom’s crystalline columns, sending stardust drizzling to the floor like jeweled rain. All eyes—light and shadow—turn to you, expectant, patient. For a moment, the entire cosmos holds its breath.  

You lift the gavel. A single strike reverberates, and the sound is neither loud nor soft but something beyond volume—a resonance that stitches time together. The walls of nebulae fold inward, the void contracts, and for an instant you glimpse the vast machinery of reality itself. Then your verdict unfolds—not as words, but as a living wave of transformation. Light and shadow entwine, creating a new resonance where neither reigns alone but each sustains the other in perpetual balance.  

The dream quivers. Stars wink out and reignite, shadows gather and disperse, all converging in a single point of silent grace. Then the dais dissolves. You feel the weight of dawn pressing at your eyelids, and with one last echo of your gavel’s strike, the dream falls away.  

You awaken, heart still thrumming with the memory of cosmic scales tipping, uncertain whether you were judge or participant—but certain that somewhere, in the echo between worlds, your ruling carries on its infinite journey.
