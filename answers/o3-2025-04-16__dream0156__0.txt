I am dreaming.

I’m standing on a beach made of glowing glass shards—each sliver a frozen screenshot of every post, like, and DM I have ever tapped.  The shoreline scrolls upward instead of outward, a vertical horizon that stretches into star-dusted clouds.  Each wave that laps against my shins is not water but a ribbon of looping videos: strangers dancing, pets lip-synching, wars compressed into twenty-second reels.  They soak into my skin, turn my nerves into tingling fiber-optic cables, and the tide pulls, pulls, pulls me deeper into the feed.

Above me, gulls wheel in perfect circles, their wings sprouting notification badges that flash scarlet—1, 2, 37, 418—until the sky itself looks like a feverish inbox.  Whenever a badge bursts, glitter falls, and I can’t resist catching it on my tongue.  Every flake tastes like instant approval, then disintegrates into the blandness of cardboard.  Yet I keep licking the air, hungrier each time.

Farther inland rises a city of glowing towers.  The buildings resemble smartphones balanced on end, their glass faces looping stories in infinite vertical motion.  I wander into an avenue where pedestrians walk without feet—just thumbs dragging beneath them, propelling them forward.  Their faces glow with blue light but hold no eyes; instead they show mirrors so that when I glance their way, I only see my own reflection, pupils dilated from midnight scrolling.

I push into one titanic tower, and an elevator of pure algorithm hauls me upward.  The doors open onto a cavernous chamber filled with ticking clocks—grandfather clocks, wristwatches, sundials—yet every face has melted, numbers dripping like honey into a bottomless pit.  A stained-glass sign overhead reads: SCREEN TIME: 11h 36m TODAY.  A second sign flickers: WEEKLY AVERAGE: 79h 14m.  In the pit, I hear the echo of voices I never replied to in real life—my sister asking for help moving, a friend inviting me to coffee—all swallowed by the algorithmic abyss.

I feel a tremor of panic, and that quiver summons the Custodian of Quiet: a tall figure stitched from off-line moments.  His coat is made of dog-eared pages, ticket stubs, guitar strings, and specks of campfire ash.  He carries a lantern that glows not blue, but golden—warm, edges soft as sunrise.  He says nothing, only lifts the lantern, and its beam cleaves the chamber.  Where it touches the melted clocks, they solidify, tick once, and sigh in relief.  Where it brushes my skin, the buzzing cables beneath dissolve, replaced by the old thrum of heartbeat and breath.

The floor falls away, and we plummet into a forest of hush.  Trees are tall whispers, and their leaves are the minutes I’ve lost—fluttering, waiting to be reclaimed.  The Custodian shows me a clearing where time pools like liquid glass.  “Drink,” his silence seems to say.  I kneel and sip.  The taste is simple: the smell of rain on sidewalks, laughter around a table, the slow stretch of a Sunday morning.  With each swallow, the frantic itch in my thumbs subsides.  I flex my hands; they feel lighter than they have in years.

When I look up, the giant phones on the beach are toppled, screens dark.  The gulls have become real birds, white feathers, no badges.  Stars blink, patient, uncommanded by notifications.  I breathe in, and the air is free of updates.  A final tide rolls in, not of videos but of cool water that erases the glowing shards beneath my feet, leaving soft sand.

“I’ll forget this,” I fear aloud, hearing my voice for the first time in the dream.

The Custodian’s lantern dims, but before darkness claims it, he presses the handle into my palm.  It is warm, real.  Etched on the brass is a single reminder: Log out to drop in.

I wake with the dawn honeying my bedroom wall, phone still beside me but face-down, silent.  The echo of waves remains in my ears, but they’re regular waves now, steady and slow.  I rise, set the phone on the far shelf, and carry the quiet with me into the day—lantern glowing, thumbprints clean.
