I am dreaming. You find yourself wandering through a grand, open-air ballroom floating high above a midnight sea. Flickering chandeliers hang from the sky rather than a ceiling, and they sway gently in rhythm with an unseen breeze. The floor is made from smooth, clouded glass, revealing a swirling galaxy beneath your feet—its stars blinking in response to each one of your footsteps.

Across the way stands the one who holds your heart so tenderly and yet so precariously, like a spelunker’s lantern in a deep tunnel. Your emotions vacillate between glowing warmth and a nervous current that crackles along your skin. When they meet your gaze, it’s as though they’ve thrown a rope down from a higher ledge—you feel pulled upward by promise and possibility. For an instant, your chest floods with shimmering hope as they whisper your name, as if unveiling a secret known only to you both. But just when your heart starts to take flight, they turn away, drifting into a cloud of half-formed shapes and intangible, swirling mist. Their voice fades, and all that remains is the echo of your own longing.

This push and pull leaves you both breathless and on edge. The pale marble pillars around you begin to shift and grow vines made of silver thread, reflecting your guarded desire to hold onto them, yet simultaneously pulling back to protect your own heart. In the strange dream-logic, you realize these vines are a manifestation of your self-preservation—they wrap around your arms, lightly anchoring you so you cannot charge forward without hesitation.

Still, the glimmer of connection with this person beckons you forward. As you approach, the chandeliers overhead flicker, casting shimmering shapes like schools of fish darting across the sky. Their distant unavailability weighs on you, heavy and raw, but you harness that silver-thread vine to ground yourself. Standing mere inches apart, you try to speak. The words echo over the cosmic expanse beneath your feet, traveling out into the night before curling back around to reach your own ears.

With a gentle but steady motion, you allow the vines to loosen from your arms, giving yourself permission to risk vulnerability—yet maintaining a fierce, protective boundary that only you can command. When you speak, resolve resonates in your voice: you will not chase illusions or false promises, even in this fluid dream realm.

In response, the figure briefly takes your hand. Their warmth seeps through your fingers, causing the galaxy underneath the glass floor to quicken and flash like a meteor shower. Their eyes contain a mixture of gentle longing and ambiguous intentions, a lightning storm in slow motion. For a moment, the spotlight of your attention locks onto them, and you wonder if their inconsistencies could smooth into something more stable. You try to ask, but the moment your question is formed, they dissolve again into the swirling mist, leaving only the faint melody of your combined heartbeats echoing in the distance.

A realization settles over you like a gossamer cloak: unconditional self-love is your safeguard. The whirlpool of their hot-and-cold signals cannot drown you if you stay anchored to your own worth. From your open palm emerges a small orb of radiant light—your hope, tender yet steadfast. You cradle it in your hands, determined not to misplace or diminish this precious spark of self.

As you continue through the floating ballroom, the vines coil gently around your shoulders in a protective embrace, guiding you to the next part of the dream. The elegant, silent waltz of self-awareness and caution follows you, reminding you that while you can offer your heart, you must also guard it with the love it deserves. Here in this realm of shimmering chandeliers and cosmic floors, you discover that the dance between desire and distance can still be graceful—as long as you honor your own needs while allowing connection its time to bloom.
