I am dreaming. I stand frozen in a moonlit garden, surrounded by twisted vines and withered flowers. The air is heavy with the sweet scent of honeysuckle, tainted by an undercurrent of decay. Before me, a figure I love turns away, shoulders slumped, hands clutching a heart-shaped pendant that once hung around my own neck. The betrayal in their eyes cuts deeper than any knife.

As guilt crashes over me like a suffocating tide, the garden around me transforms. Roses blacken and wither, their stems crackling like old bones. A rusted key materializes in my palm, vibrating with latent power. I try desperately to speak, to explain, but my words emerge garbled and incoherent, like a drowning man trying to scream through the water.

The figure glances back, tears silvering their face. Their mouth moves, whispering your fault, your fault, your fault, but no sound reaches my ears. The ground beneath my feet crumbles, revealing a cavern where our shared memories swirl like dark liquid. Each one I touch splinters into a thousand painful shards.

A clock appears in their hand, its face shattered, hands moving backwards through time. They turn to leave, but I grasp their arm. The touch is ice cold, making their skin mottle and fade. Horrified, I release them, falling to my knees as the ground continues to disintegrate.

In the darkness below, I see reflections of all the times I let them down. Each moment of hurt and neglect manifests - a growing collection of invisible knives plunged between their ribs. Their eyes meet mine one last time, holding both heartbreaking sorrow and genuine fear of what I've become. Then they vanish, leaving me alone in a garden now reduced to nothing but thorns and shadows. The clock materializes in my hand, its broken mechanism continuing to turn, marking out the seconds until I wake knowing it was all just a dream - or was it?
