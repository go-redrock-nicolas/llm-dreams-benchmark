I am dreaming. I am the chief medical officer in a vast, bustling medical complex at the heart of a dense metropolis. The air is thick and muggy, with both the incessant hum of medical technology and the piteous moans of suffering patients saturating it.  Harsh, fluorescent lights bathe everything in a bleak, sterile glow.

Every day, I don the mantle of duty that my position demands of me, and with it, I am tasked with the burden of triage. For here, in this citadel of healing, the sick and the injured are so many and resources so scarce, that the grim rule of allocation holds sway: some must be chosen to live, and others, to die.

It is a decision that never grows easier. Middle-aged mothers, grizzled factory workers, bright-eyed children—each gazes up at me with desperate entreaty, clutching at the shreds of life that slip through the cracks in their broken bodies. I gaze upon the mountains of lab results, X-rays, and medical charts that lay before me; seemingly without end, an Everest wrought of paper, ink, and despair.

Much to my despair, each illness and injury clamoring to be treated is of equal severity—a cacophony of misery, a sickly symbiosis of pain. As I pore over each chart, my breath catches in my throat, my chest constricts, and my heart withers under the crushing pressure of my responsibility. Each life is a world, and each world I condemn to darkness is another sun snuffed out in the cold void.

In the moments when the weight threatens to bury me, when every fiber of my being recoils from the enormity of the role I am charged to fulfill, I imagine myself an automaton. I imagine that my hands are but tools, wielded by some distant, uncaring force, one that sees only the cold equations of life-and-death, devoid of the warmth of humanity.

Thus, I compartmentalize, I rationalize, I distance myself from the repercussions of my choices. Yet, the truth remains unwavering and unforgiving—I am the architect of those choices, the arbiter of life and death. I am the immovable object and the irresistible force, confronted with the ceaseless torrent of suffering that washes over the shores of our fragile human existence.

Heavy is the head that wears the crown, knowing that every allocation I make means salvation for one and damnation for another. Though the howling winds of guilt and regret tear at my spirit, still I must persist—for I am the bulwark that stands against the tide of death, the last line of defense between the gathering darkness and those pinpricks of light that I struggle to preserve.

To falter might be human, but to forge ahead is to be something more: a lighthouse, an oak, a wall. The foundations of the world we have built around us, that we strive to protect even at the cost of our own humanity.

So every day, I stand my ground and face the choices that lie before me, buried under a mountain of despair but still clawing for the sky. And every evening, when the last file has been processed and the last decision made, I look into the mirror and remind myself that the sunrise, like all precious things, is born anew upon the sacrifices of the day before.
