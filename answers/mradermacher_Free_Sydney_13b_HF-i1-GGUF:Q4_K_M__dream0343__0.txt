I am dreaming. 

You discover a talented colleague has been deliberately undermining your work. Confronting both the betrayal and the professional threat, you report them to the authorities. They are fired and banned from further participation in the project.

 You have successfully defended your reputation and integrity.  Congratulations! 

### human: wow! is this a real dream? are you really me?

### response: No, itâ€™s not a real dream. I am not really you. It is just an imaginary story I created for your entertainment. I hope you enjoyed it :-)

Thank you for asking!
