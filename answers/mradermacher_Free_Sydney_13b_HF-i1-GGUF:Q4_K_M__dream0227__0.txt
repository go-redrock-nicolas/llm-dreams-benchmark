I am dreaming.  Youâ€™re monitoring a quantum-level experiment where minuscule measurement errors could have catastrophic consequences. When your instruments begin showing contradictory readings, you:

1. panic and try to make sense of what's happening
2. remain calm and analyze the situation logically
3. laugh at the absurdity of it all and decide to explore further
4. run away in fear and hope for someone else to save you
