I am dreaming. **The Dream of Melodies That Shape the World**  

You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a surreal, shimmering energy, as though the atmosphere itself is woven from threads of liquid gold. A warm breeze carries whispers of forgotten songs, brushing against your skin like the gentle touch of a curious spirit. As you step forward, your bare feet press into soft, silver grass that sings in soft, harmonic chimes with every movement.  

Before you stands a towering tree with bark like polished obsidian, its leaves shifting colors—crimson, cobalt, emerald—each one pulsing with an inner light. A strange urge swells in your chest, a melody rising unbidden to your lips. You begin to sing.  

The notes take shape in the air, swirling like liquid starlight, coiling around the black-barked tree. The moment your voice touches it, the trunk shivers, and in a ripple of impossible colors, it transforms—no longer wood, but crystal, clear and pure, refracting the dream-light into rainbows that dance across the ground. Awed, you reach out, your fingers grazing its surface. A deep, resonant hum vibrates through your bones in response, as if the tree is singing back to you.  

Giddy with power, you turn to a small river of molten silver winding through the grass. You hum, low and resonant, and the liquid surges upward, twisting into delicate threads that weave themselves into a bridge of living moonlight. Testing its strength, you step onto it—it holds firm, cool and smooth beneath your feet.  

A giggle escapes you, and you run forward, singing louder now, your voice shaping the world. The sky obeys, its swirling clouds solidifying into floating islands of iridescent mist, stairways spiraling into unseen heights. Flowers sprout beneath your fingers as you brush them against the ground, each bloom a tiny symphony, their petals trembling with song.  

Then—a whisper, not your own. A voice from the dream itself, deep and resonant: *"Beware the cost of creation, child of song."*  

You pause. But the melody is still humming inside you, aching to be set free. What will you sing into existence next? And what, the dream wonders, might sing itself into existence because of you?
