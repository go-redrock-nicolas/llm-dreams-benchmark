I am dreaming. I allow all thoughts and ideas to emerge freely.

The air hums with a strange, crystalline resonance, as though the arena itself is a tuning fork struck by the hand of some unseen giant. You stand on a platform of shifting opal tiles that ripple beneath your feet like a sea frozen mid-wave. Above, a fractured sky pulses with auroras that aren’t colors you’ve ever named—velvet-void purples, scream-orange splinters, a green that tastes of burnt sugar. The crowd? Shadows cast by nothing, their edges blurred as if smudged by gods who grew bored halfway through creation.

Your challenge hangs suspended in the air—a sphere of quicksilver mercury, morphing from harp to chessboard to a labyrinth of mirrors in the span of a breath. *Synthesis*, the arbiters had called it. The one skill your bones reject, the art of spinning discord into harmony, of weaving threads your mind keeps snipping with the scissors of your doubt. You’ve choked on it for years, tripping over dualities, unraveling every time opposites collided in your hands.

But now—now the mercury sphere splits. A piano made of frost forms to your left, keys carved from arctic wind. To your right, a forge blooms, its flames singing in a language older than consonants. The crowd-shadows lean forward, their hollows buzzing. 

Your hands move.

Left hand on the frozen keys. A chord spills out—glacial, pure, each note a shard cutting your fingertips. Right hand plunges into the forge. Molten notes rise, raw and roaring, searing runes into your palm. Agony. Ecstasy. The melodies war, screeching like sworn enemies… until your spine remembers. 

There’s a fractal in the storm, a pattern etched by lightning. You let your blood become the conductor. Frost and fire braid into a helix, birthing a new timbre: sunlight refracted through icicles, wildfire tempered by midnight rain. The sphere shudders. Cracks. 

And there, in the splintering, you glimpse it—not harmony, but something wilder. A third thing, alive and snarling, forged not by balance but collision. The crowd-shapes howl in a language of scattering stars. 

You wake with your hands still humming, the taste of impossible music sharp on your tongue.
