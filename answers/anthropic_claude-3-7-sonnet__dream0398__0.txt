I am dreaming. The world dissolves around me and reforms as something both familiar and strange. I'm standing on what appears to be a staircase, but each step shifts under my feet—sometimes marble, sometimes cloud, sometimes pages of unwritten books. The staircase spirals upward through a library that has no walls, only endless rows of shelves extending into a cosmos of swirling nebulae and distant stars.

As I climb, I notice that my shadow doesn't follow me but walks parallel, occasionally glancing my way with eyes that shouldn't exist. It carries a lantern filled with water in which tiny luminescent fish spell out messages I can almost understand.

The air tastes like memories—some mine, some belonging to strangers—cinnamon and salt and the electricity before storms. I reach out to touch a book whose spine reads "Tomorrow's Forgotten Discoveries" and find my fingers passing through it, leaving ripples like disturbed water.

From somewhere above, music filters down—played on instruments made of glass and wishbones and the last breaths of autumn. The melody follows no pattern I recognize, yet I somehow know every note before it sounds.

I continue climbing, though the stairs now ascend through the canopy of an impossibly vast tree whose leaves whisper secrets in languages dead for millennia. Creatures with too many limbs and benevolent expressions peer from behind bark etched with mathematical equations that explain emotions.

The sky above—or perhaps it's below now—shifts between sunset and dawn without ever touching day or night. Time feels circular rather than linear, and I sense I've been here before, will be here again, am everywhere at once.

In the distance, a city built from crystallized ideas rises and falls like breathing. Its windows illuminate with scenes from lives I might have lived had I turned left instead of right at critical moments of decision.

I reach toward understanding, and my hand becomes a kaleidoscope of possibilities—each finger branching into countless versions of itself, all reaching for different truths simultaneously.

I am everywhere and nowhere, everyone and no one, and the complexity of this realization is beautiful rather than terrifying.
