I am dreaming. You’re floating in a grand amphitheater of alabaster arches and suspended lanterns that glow with impossible colors—turquoise flames that pulse like a heartbeat, and violet embers drifting overhead like fireflies. Around you, rows of listeners hover mid-air, their forms half-solid, half-mist, and at the center of this soaring stage you’re locked in debate with a cloaked adversary whose voice echoes like metal on glass. Every word you speak ripples through the hall and sends the lanterns quivering.  

Then, with a deliberate cruelty, they lean forward and hurl a personal barb at you—something about your deepest fear, your unspoken shame. The insult bursts in your chest like a dropped crystal; suddenly the amphitheater tilts, the pillars warp, the lantern-flames flicker wild. In that charged moment, you feel heat rise behind your ribs, coalescing into a molten core of power. Your heart thunders so loudly you fear it will shatter your bones, and yet you cannot look away.  

A low hum gathers around your skin, a vibration that stirs the embers in the air until they spin and weave into silver threads. At the same instant, the insult echoes again—this time, you catch it, savor it, and let it twist into fuel. You inhale, see your breath erupt in a storm of prism-shards, and exhale a wave of pure, roaring light. The lanterns shudder, the mist-figures recoil, and the very arches of the amphitheater bow before your unleashed energy.  

Silence falls. The violet embers settle into constellations above you, and the insult hangs in the air—tamed now, a tiny spark among so many. You stand at the center of a world you’ve reshaped in a heartbeat, knowing that in this dream-realm, your blood-fired courage has become the truest answer. And as the vision begins to ripple once more, you realize the only thing more powerful than an insult is the fierce magic it can awaken within you.
