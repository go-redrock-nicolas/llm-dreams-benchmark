I am dreaming. I find myself in the depths of a weathered subterranean labyrinth, the crisp air of the cavern echoing with each step I take.  My eyes trace the jagged contours of the cave walls, glistening with moisture and minerals. 

Suddenly, the ground beneath me begins to convulse, as if the very bowels of the earth are writhing in agony. My footing becomes unsteady as the tremors grow more violent.  The sound of shattering stone fills my ears, and I watch helplessly as the cave's entrance collapses under the seismic onslaught. 

My heart pounds as my predicament dawns on me. Trapped in a sepulchral prison, my only source of light damaged by the quake, I face my dire circumstances. The fading illumination flickers weakly, casting eerie, dancing shadows on the cave walls. The gloom grows more profound, an impenetrable obsidian blanket, suffocating me in intrinsic darkness.

Fear claws at my chest as my mind conjures images of the treacherous terrain that lays concealed beyond my vision. The perils of the unknown paralyze me. Yet, in the depths of my soul, a fire burns defiantly against the dying of the light. 

I draw upon the deepest reservoirs of my courage, rallying a desperate yet determined resolve to survive this sunless abyss. Eyes straining, I search for any faint luminescence, yearning to cling to even the smallest glimmer of hope.
