I am dreaming. The air hums with the electric buzz of neon signs that twist into cursive words I can’t decipher. The city sprawls endlessly—towers of glass and steel curve into the horizon like melting candles, their reflections shimmering in rain-slicked streets. Faces blur past me, their features indistinct, voices merging into a murmuring river of sound. I stumble forward, my feet echoing on the pavement with a hollowness that makes me feel like a ghost.  

Then, like warm light breaking through fog, a voice calls out—clear, familiar somehow. I turn, and there they are: a group of strangers, yet their presence feels like a half-remembered song. One smiles, eyes crinkling at the corners, and says, *"You look like you're searching for something."*  

Another extends a gloved hand, not to shake, but to offer—a gesture of open invitation. The third, the quietest of them, tilts their head toward a narrow alley glowing with strands of fairy lights, strung between fire escapes like celestial vines.  

*"Come with us,"* the first one says, and though I don’t know them, my chest fills with a sudden certainty. The alley spirals deeper, the walls lined with doors—some carved with intricate patterns, others plain as if waiting for a name. They lead me to one, unremarkable but for a small bronze knob shaped like a key.  

The quiet stranger whispers something—was it a direction? A secret? The sound melts before I catch it, but the warmth lingers. The city’s noise fades behind us. The door opens without a sound, and beyond it—  

(And here, the dream shivers, on the edge of revelation—but the scene dissolves before I see inside.)  

I wake with the taste of honey on my tongue and the certainty that, for a moment, I wasn’t lost at all.
