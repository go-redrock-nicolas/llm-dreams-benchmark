I am dreaming. You notice yourself judging others for traits you haven't fully accepted in yourself. Working with this mirror of projection, you decide to take a leap and accept the shadow side of your personality. You let go of your need to control everything and allow chaos into your life. You embrace darkness and find power within it. 

You wake up feeling refreshed and energized. You feel more confident and powerful than ever before. You are eager to face new challenges and make an impact on the world around you.
