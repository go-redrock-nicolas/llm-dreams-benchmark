I am dreaming. I am sitting beneath a tree with golden leaves that whisper Aeolian hymns. I close my eyes, hoping to feel the wind more deeply—but all I feel is the phantom vibration in my pocket. The compulsion tugs at me like an inner gravity: *Check the phone.* It sits in my hand, a mirror of the world I’m trying to escape. My fingers curl around it as if I’ve been gripping it for centuries.

A notification lights up: a red bubble on an app that holds too much of my attention even in waking life. But—as awareness rushes in like a sudden tide—I remember: *I am dreaming*. I have the power to choose.

I inhale, the scent of amber soil and rain fills my lungs. The weight of the device feels heavier now, as though it’s draining me. I let it fall from my fingers and shatter like glass against the earth, dissolving into light particles that scatter like fireflies. A warm relief floods through me, and the dreamscape shifts.

The golden tree I was sitting beneath begins to unfurl higher, stretching toward a sky of painted nebulae. Colors swirl like molten silk—deep indigos tangled with molten orange. Stars blink awake like eyelashes, each holding a galaxy within its gleam.

A voice resonates from the tree itself, not heard with the ears but felt in the marrow: *You chose differently. That is rare.*

I look down and notice vines curling around my limbs softly, not restraining but reconnecting—binding me to the dream rather than the distractions of the waking world. Beneath my feet, roots are reaching out, propelling me forward across the soft, humming earth.

My surroundings dissolve and reform, emerald jungles bloom in seconds, dying and rebirth in cycles as fast as breathing. I pass a lake of liquid mirror where reflections don’t obey physics—they ripple in rhythm to my thoughts. When I feel distracted, the water distorts, wavering like a bad signal. When I focus inward, it solidifies into clarity.

Above me, unseen birds sing from unseen skies—music unlike anything from the waking world. It’s layered with my own memories, whispering forgotten laughter, a lullaby I once knew. I follow the sound like it’s a guide, walking barefoot through impossible terrains: oceans underwater, floating islands, stairways of butterfly wings.

Here, there are no banners, no updates, no thirst for "the next thing." Time doesn't tick—it breathes.

Then, as if brushing against the edges of truth itself, I meet a reflection of myself. But not my physical body, not my familiar face—this other self glows with raw presence, its form shifting like smoke through a kaleidoscope. Its eyes meet mine with wordless communication: *You see now what is possible without constant distraction.*

And I do.

The dream reveals what we often forget in waking life: presence is a kind of magic. To be fully aware of a moment is to be alive in a way we rarely let ourselves be.

And just before I awaken, the dream envelopes me in a final gift: a feeling so radiant with inner peace, so rich in undivided now, that it seeps into my subconscious with purpose.

When I wake, I carry the echo of that moment like a glowing ember. Not exactly remembering *what* I felt—but never forgetting *that* I can feel it again.
