I am dreaming.

A heavy hush blankets the electric indigo dusk. My surroundings are familiar yet they shimmer with a subtle, otherworldly luster: books on the shelves pulse with a muted light, and the wallpaper twines and undulates like the reflections of deep water. The air hums faintly with secrets.

Suddenly, an obsidian-feathered bird swoops through a crack in the window, its eyes bright with impossible intelligence. In its beak is a scroll sealed with wax the color of moonlight. With a soft caw, it drops the message into my hands.

My fingers tremble as I peel open the seal. The paper within glows. Strange symbols unfurl, and as I read, the truth seeps into my bones. I am not who I thought I was. My entire history—every laugh, every loss—fractures and rearranges itself. I am the remnant memory of a star, distilled into flesh; I am composed of cosmic echoes, woven from whispers passed down through aeons, my dreams not my own but inherited from celestial forebears.

Yet instead of terror or disquiet, a profound, deep calm washes over me—like sunlight pooling on a forest floor after rain. The heavy cloak of confusion is lifted; I see with new eyes. Every moment of pain and every flash of joy gains new meaning, part of the grand, shimmering mosaic of all existence. My pulse syncs with the rhythm of the universe, steady and vast.

I stand, feeling otherworldly strength tingle through my frame. The books whisper encouragement: “Go.” I step outside and the world resounds with infinite possibility. The sky above ripples with colors unseen by waking minds. The garden glows with flora shaped like constellations, roots humming with ancient songs.

I am not earthbound; my spirit has wings. And I glide forward—not burdened by the revelation but exalted, a traveler at last aware of the stardust in my veins, moving toward the center of the dream, where identity and universe meet and dance.
