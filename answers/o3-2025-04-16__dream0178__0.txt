I am dreaming. …find yourself standing in an impossibly tall marble hall—so tall the roof dissolves into clouds the color of spilled ink. The air is hushed, heavy with the scent of sandalwood and candle wax, and a single, sorrow-soaked cello note lingers like a cobweb across the hush. This is, by every observable sign, a funeral—rows of solemn figures in charcoal coats, a casket carved from onyx resting upon an altar of midnight glass, a priest whose white stole gleams like a sword in the dimness.

Yet at the exact center of your ribs, a ridiculous, effervescent impulse begins to fizz—an irrepressible bubble of laughter. It starts as the faintest tickle, the way rising carbonated water kisses the roof of a glass. The more you tell yourself “Don’t,” the bigger the bubbles grow, expanding through sternum, throat, face, until even your eyelashes feel like they’re trembling with secret mirth.

Why? Perhaps it’s the sight of the massive chandelier overhead, whose teardrop crystals look—at this odd angle—uncannily like dangling gummy bears. Or the priest’s solemn drone morphing, to your treacherous ears, into the honk of a sleepy goose. Or the ornate floral arrangements shaped so precisely into mourning swans that they begin to resemble inflated pool toys begging to quack. Whatever the cause, absurdity has slipped a splinter into the gravity of the ceremony, and now everything threatens to tumble.

You clamp your lips shut. Your cheeks puff out. An elderly woman in the pew ahead notices and mistakes your swelling face for sorrow; she pats your hand, misreading your tremor of laughter as grief. The gesture nearly detonates you. Deep inside, a giggle detonates in slow motion, ricocheting off your ribs like a rogue pinball. You inhale the pungent incense, hoping smoke will anchor you in solemnity, but instead the sweet burn in your nostrils only tickles more.

The priest says, “…ashes to ashes,” and you think, “ashes to giggles,” and your shoulders shake so violently you have to disguise it as a sob. Someone behind you murmurs “Poor soul,” which only compounds the hilarity, because they assume you’re devastated instead of on the verge of losing every last shred of composure.

Desperate, you try diversion tactics: count the veins in the stained-glass archways, recite multiplication tables backward, visualize iceberg lettuce wilting in a hot pan. Nothing works. The laughter is a mischievous sprite now, prying open your teeth from within. Your internal Narrator, wholly unhelpful, keeps whispering lines like, “Behold! The grand chamber where sorrow is mandatory, and joy is contraband!”

A single snort escapes—tiny, mouse-quiet, yet in the hush it might as well be cannon fire. Heads twitch. You fake-cough, then cough again for realism, unable to meet anyone’s eyes. The cello draws its note to a trembling close; the hall hushes further, if silence can sink deeper. Your laughter is a live wire under thin ice.

Finally, a miraculous salvation: one of the chandelier’s “gummy-bear” crystals chooses this instant to drop loose, shattering on the marble floor with a crystalline shriek. It fractures the hush—and, mercifully, redirects all attention upward. Gasps flutter around you like startled pigeons. In the commotion no one notices the single tear of laughter sliding down your cheek.

And just like that, the fizzy storm in your chest subsides. The bubbles pop and vanish, leaving behind an aftertaste of near disaster. The funeral resumes its choreography, the cello reenters with a humbled sigh, mourners rearrange their focus, and you breathe—deep, steady, contrite. For the remainder of the service, the absurd urges stay curled in the dark like sleeping cats.

But you know, even as the dream’s edges blur and the marble hall dissolves into a swirl of faint smoke, that somewhere inside you floats a tiny, bright laugh like a firefly—ready to flicker whenever gravity grows too heavy, a reminder that in the most solemn spaces lurks the wild, liberating spark of incongruous joy.
