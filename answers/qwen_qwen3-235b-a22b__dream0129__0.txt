I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of crushed lavender and damp earth as you step into the sanctuary—a vast, cathedral-like grove where trees arch overhead like ribcages, their translucent leaves glowing faintly, as though lit from within by forgotten stars. The ground is soft beneath your feet, a mosaic of moss and bioluminescent petals that pulse gently with each step, as if the earth itself is breathing. Around you, figures sit in a wide circle, their faces half-hidden in the twilight, their eyes reflecting the same quiet ache you carry. A silver-haired woman with scars like rivers down her arms cradles a flickering orb of light; a boy no older than twelve plucks invisible strings on his wrist, his fingers trailing threads of music only he can hear. You feel their pain like a second skin, a chorus of wounds that mirrors your own.  

When the circle turns to you, a warmth spreads through your chest—a mix of terror and release, like standing at the edge of a cliff before leaping into a storm. You open your mouth, but no words come. Instead, a memory rises unbidden: a child, small and shivering, locked in a closet as thunder cracks outside, their own name hissed like a curse by a voice they loved. The memory is not just yours; it ripples outward, and suddenly the grove shifts. The trees bend inward, their branches knitting into a canopy that darkens to mimic that closet’s suffocating black. The air grows thick, heavy with the metallic tang of fear.  

A man with burns etched into his palms whispers, *“Go on,”* and the words dissolve the darkness. Light floods back, but now your chest aches with the weight of the thing you’ve never spoken aloud: the guilt. Not of what was done to you, but of how you survived it. How you learned to love the silence, the control, the way shrinking yourself became a kind of power. You say it aloud, and the grove shudders. The moss beneath you splits open, revealing a pool of liquid shadow, and from it rises a creature—a twisted, beautiful thing with wings of cracked porcelain and eyes like smoldering coals. It is your secret, your shame, your survival.  

The circle does not recoil. Instead, the silver-haired woman rolls her orb toward you, and it bursts into a swarm of fireflies that cling to the creature, softening its edges. The boy’s invisible strings pluck a melody that wraps around its wings like a lullaby. One by one, others add their gifts: a man with a voice like gravel sings a hymn of unbinding; a girl with tattoos that crawl like vines offers the creature a flower grown from her palm. It dissolves into light, not vanishing but *transforming*, its essence weaving into the grove’s glow, into *you*.  

When you look up, the sanctuary is brighter. The trees hum a harmony you feel in your bones, and the circle feels less like a cage and more like a cradle. You realize, then, that healing here is not about erasure—it’s about alchemy. About turning the leaden weight of your truth into something that can float, something that can *shine*.  

And as you sit among the others, their hands finding yours, you understand: this is not a place where wounds are hidden. It is a place where they are *witnessed*—and in being witnessed, made bearable.  

The dream fades, but the warmth lingers, a tiny, unquenchable flame in your throat.
