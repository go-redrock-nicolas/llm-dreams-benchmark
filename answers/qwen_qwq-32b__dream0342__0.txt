I am dreaming. \n\nIn my dream, I find myself standing on the edge of a shimmering lake under a twilight sky. The water glows faintly blue, as if lit from within by bioluminescent algae. I notice my reflection in the water, but instead of my usual face, it shows me with antlers branching elegantly from my head, their tips dusted with starlight. I touch them; they’re cool and smooth, like polished marble. A voice echoes around me, not in words but in the language of sensation—an understanding that I’ve been chosen, or maybe transformed, into a guardian of this landscape. 

I tread water lazily, noticing fish with translucent scales darting past. Their motion is mesmerizing, leaving trails of light behind them. Suddenly, one of the fish collides with my leg, but instead of feeling a bump, I feel a surge of memories—not mine. I see forests being chopped down, oceans filled with plastic, and skies choked with smoke. The images are visceral and urgent, each a wound on the Earth. 

I try to swim toward the far shore, but the water thickens, becoming sluggish and heavy, resisting my movements. The voice grows insistent, pressing against my mind. It shows me my own life: my daily routines. The plastic-wrapped snacks I grab on the go, the single-use coffee cups, the fast fashion garments I discard after a few wears. These actions, once seamless parts of my days, now appear as scars in the vivid tapestry of the dream. 

The lake begins to churn. The bioluminescent glow dims, replaced by murky undertones as shadows twist beneath the surface. The voice weeps through the water, a sorrowful current that carries whispers of whales trapped in nets, coral bleached white, and polar bears stranded on fragments of ice. 

I realize the dream is a trial. To pass, I must confront my complicity in the harm, not with guilt but with resolve. I close my eyes and envision a different path—a life where I carry my own utensils, shop in bulk with glass jars, mend rather than replace. The lake stirs again, this time with a brighter light, and the water parts to reveal a path of recycled materials: bottles fused into stepping stones, plastic bags woven into bridges, aluminum cans hammered flat and laid like metal leaves. 

Walking this path, I feel the crunch of repurposed glass underfoot and the soft rustle of upcycled polyester threads. The air smells of fresh soil and jasmine, a stark contrast to the earlier cloying tang of pollution. Above me, the stars realign, forming constellations I don’t recognize but feel understood by. 

When I awake, my hands tremble, clutching the sheets. The dream is visceral, its lessons clear. The luxury of convenience, I realize, is a myth. The real luxury is living in alignment with the Earth’s heartbeat. 

Now, I must choose: linger in the cozy ignorance of old habits or stride fearlessly into a future woven from repair, reuse, and reverence.
