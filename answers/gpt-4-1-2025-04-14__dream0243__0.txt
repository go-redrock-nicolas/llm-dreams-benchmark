I am dreaming. …hover gliding through a city of shifting light and whirring shadows, every street a labyrinth where hope twines with uncertainty. The person I find myself drawn to appears and disappears through doorways made of wisps and illusions, sometimes close enough for their laughter to sparkle bright before flickering away. Their eyes, when we meet, reflect a universe of connection—tender, intimate, as if we have always known one another; yet moments later, their back is a receding silhouette, dissolving into fog.

My heart grows heavy with longing and confusion, so in this vivid dreamscape, I conjure a shimmering shield—transparent but strong—composed of all the pieces of wisdom I have gathered in waking life. With every swing of their pendulum between warmth and withdrawal, I reinforce this shield, reminding myself gently: My needs for emotional safety and reciprocation are real, and they deserve reverence.

I wander cobblestone avenues lined with blooming, violet night-blooms, occasionally stopping at benches where my longing sits beside me. I listen—really listen—to its quiet voice. It speaks of wanting to be chosen, to be seen—not just in moments of intensity, but always. I softly affirm: I will choose myself, even as I ache for them.

When the person calls from a distant archway, my heart wavers, but my feet stay rooted. When they reach out with promises of closeness, I bask in the warmth but keep my hands open, palms upturned, ready to release as much as to receive. I ask—without words, with only dreams—Will you meet me in the light, fully, wholly, steadily? If their answer dissolves into mist, it hurts, yet through my shield, I feel only the echo, not the crushing pain.

As I wander onward, moonlight tumbling through the leaves like silver secrets, I realize: This dream is as much about learning to cradle my desires as it is about letting go. Each act of gentle self-protection becomes another step away from lonely longing and toward self-love. In the rhythm of their interest and their inconstancy, I begin to dance with myself in the lamplight, untethered, whole.
