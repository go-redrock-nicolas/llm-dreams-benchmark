I am dreaming. I wake up to find myself standing at the edge of a vast, serene lake. The water stretches out endlessly, its surface reflecting the brilliant blue of the cloudless sky above. A small wooden boat bobs gently at the water's edge, as if waiting for me.

As I approach the boat, a figure emerges from the mist that rises from the lake's surface. It's a woman with long, flowing hair of burnished gold. Her dress seems woven from the very essence of water - movements ripple like waves across the fabric. She introduces herself as Amphitrite, Queen of the Sea, from ancient Greek mythology.

Amphitrite speaks in a voice like the gentle lapping of waves. She tells me that I've been summoned here for a great quest. A powerful artifact, the Pearl of Neptune, has been stolen from the depths of the sea by a mischievous water demon named Limnades. This pearl keeps the oceans' balance, and without it, the tides are growing erratic, threatening coastal cities worldwide.

The Queen of the Sea hands me a magical fishing rod, explaining that it will lead me to where the demon lurks. As I take the rod, it vibrates in my hands, pointing towards a cave visible at the far end of the lake.

I climb into the boat, and as Amphitrite presses a kiss to my forehead, the vessel moves of its own accord across the glass-like surface of the water. her power propels me toward the cave. The journey is long, but the scenery around me shifts and changes - I pass by islands of crystal, encounter schools of fish that swim through the air like birds, and even glimpse a massive sea serpent coiling around the bow of distant ships.

When I finally reach the cave, I find myself in a vast underwater grotto lit by bioluminescent creatures. The fishing rod leads me deeper into the twisting passages until I come face to face with Limnades - a creature of liquid darkness that shifts constantly, defying any fixed form.

The demon speaks in a voice reminiscent of rushing water. He offers to return the Pearl of Neptune only if I can answer three riddles. Each riddle solved correctly will bring me closer to my goal, but each failure will trap me deeper in the cave system, further from the surface and my chance at saving the world.

I accept the challenge, knowing the fate of millions depends on my ability to outwit this ancient water spirit. The first riddle echoes through the grotto: "What can be broken, but never held?"
