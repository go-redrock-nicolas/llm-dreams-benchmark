I am dreaming.

The world here shimmers with iridescent hues, as if all colors have dissolved into one another under a liquid sky. I inhabit the body of a being whose skin is adorned with intricate patterns—glowing sigils that shift with my emotions, reflecting my place within this society's endlessly layered hierarchy. My limbs feel alien yet fluid, curling in gestures of deference or assertion with every measured movement.

The city rises around me like a petrified forest: slender towers and archways of pearl and obsidian, connected by winding bridges draped with bioluminescent banners. Status here is everything, and it radiates from each citizen in subtle tides—rings of color in the iris, harmonics in their voices, fractal emblems trailing from their garments like drifting smoke. Every encounter is a coded dance, an exchange of respectful bows, carefully worded acknowledgments, and glances that must never linger too long or flicker too fast.

I glide through the crowded plaza, the whispers of conversation brushing at my mind: phrases dense with significance, every syllable and inflection weighed by ancient law. The air is thick with the perfume of ceremonial blossoms, heavy with expectation.

And then, with a shiver like falling through ice, I realize my error. A misstep during the Ritual of Recognition—my tone too hasty, my gaze lifted too high—startles the High Marshal, a figure resplendent in layers of translucent silk, her status trailing behind her like a comet’s tail. The plaza goes silent. My sigils flicker and dim, broadcasting my disgrace to every onlooker.

The atmosphere changes instantly. Air grows colder, heavy with a thousand eyes. Upright and motionless, others watch me with expressions unreadable, save for the subtle tightening of shoulders, the smallest retreat by those of lower rank, the tiniest shudder of disdain from the elite. I feel the hierarchy binding me, pressing against my skin, layers upon layers of unspoken protocols now coalescing into a mask of shame.

Yet through the haze of embarrassment, a strange clarity emerges. Somewhere in the crowd, a councilor with eyes like polished jet gestures ever-so-softly—an invitation, perhaps, or a lifeline. Instinct guides me. I bow, more deeply than before, letting my sigils flare with the pale blue of contrition and hope, and wait for the judgment of a world where every movement is fate woven in living light.
