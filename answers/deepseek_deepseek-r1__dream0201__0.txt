I am dreaming. Now, create the rest of the dream narrative, keeping the description rich and layered with sensory details and symbolic elements. Keep response under 500 words.

Alright, the user wants me to create a vivid dream involving ancient catacombs and a flickering light. They specified rich sensory details and symbolic elements. Let me start by setting the scene. The catacombs should feel ancient and oppressive. 

I need to evoke the senses: the smell of damp stone, the feel of rough walls, maybe the taste of old air. The flickering light adds tension—maybe use a torch since it's more primal than a flashlight. As the light fails, the darkness becomes a character itself. 

Symbolic elements... maybe the darkness whispers, representing subconscious fears. The glowing moss on the walls could symbolize guidance or hidden truths. A cavern with light at the end adds hope, but melting shadow figures introduce conflict. Walking through them could show confronting fears. 

A stone arch with the phrase "Lux In Tenebris" (light in darkness) adds a Latin touch, making it mysterious. Upon touching the arch, the user dissolves into shadow but emerges transformed, symbolizing rebirth. Dawn breaking outside signifies resolution and renewal.

Need to keep the narrative flowing, build suspense with each light flicker, use colors like jade and molten gold for visuals. Avoid clichés, ensure each element ties into the sensory and symbolic aspects. Keep it under 500 words, so concise yet descriptive paragraphs. Check that the emotions shift from fear to empowerment, tying the symbols together.
The air thickens with the damp musk of ancient stone as your flickering torch licks shadows across the labyrinth’s pockmarked walls. Each guttering flame carves fleeting faces into the rock—twisted mouths screaming silently, hollow eyes widening as the light wanes. The darkness between pulses doesn’t just swallow sight; it *sounds* different. Whispers coil around your ankles like serpents, murmuring half-formed warnings in tongues that scratch at your spine. Your breath hitches, fraying into echoes that scatter like startled insects.  

Ahead, the corridor splits into three jagged mouths. The torch sputters, casting a hemorrhage of orange light across a glyph-scarred archway. Symbols pulse faintly—a serpent swallowing its tail, a thorned rose weeping obsidian droplets. The air here tastes metallic, like licking a buried knife. You reach to trace the carvings, but the torch dies completely.  

Blackness swarms, liquid and impenetrable.  

Then—soft as a moth’s wing—bioluminescent moss ignites along the walls, viridian filaments knitting a wavering path. It beckons you deeper, the glow pooling in your palms as you brush the stone. The walls now breathe, contracting with a low, wet rhythm. Drip, drip. Something watery splashes beneath your boots. Phosphorescent fungi cluster like swollen stars, illuminating a cavern where stalactites pierce downward like teeth in a fossilized jaw. At the center, a pool of black water shivers, its surface reflecting not your face, but a crown of smoldering constellations.  

A sound claws upward—a choir of voices harmonizing in reverse, unraveling into dissonance. The water stirs. Figures rise, their bodies sheer as ink suspended in glass. They reach for you, limbs elongating, shadows pooling at their fingertips. Your torch reignites in a violent gasp of flame, but the light *melts* them, their forms collapsing into liquid night that hisses against the stone. The smell of burnt sage and decay floods your nostrils.  

You run.  

The corridors spiral tighter, walls now lined with skeletal hands clasping rusted lanterns. Their bony fingers twitch as you pass. One lantern flares to life—a sickly lilac flame inside a cage of ribs—revealing a staircase carved with tidal waves frozen mid-crash. Ascending, you emerge into a vaulted chamber where a single shaft of moonlight pierces a domed ceiling. Beneath it, a stone archway frames nothingness, its edges carved with seraphim and scaled beasts locked in embrace. A phrase loops in gilded script: *Lux In Tenebris Lucet.*  

The torch gutter-dies. Final.  

Shivering, you step through the arch.  

Cold blooms in your chest—a key turning in a lock—and suddenly, you *are* the light. Your edges dissolve into shimmering particulates, pouring into the labyrinth’s veins. You flood hidden chambers where faceless scribes etch dreams onto papyrus made of moth wings, spill across a subterranean river where drowned bells toll in harmonic reverse, seep into the roots of a colossal tree whose branches pierce the earth’s crust, blooming with eyes that weep liquid silver.  

You wake at dawn, salt on your lips, sunlight st
