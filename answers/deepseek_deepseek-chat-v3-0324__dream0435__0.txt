I am dreaming. The air around me hums with an electric softness, like the space between sleep and waking, ripe with unseen currents. My hands float before me, not as flesh and bone, but as vessels of glowing energy, pulsing in rhythm with the thoughts flickering through my mind. I realize—*I am projecting*. Every twitch of my fingertips sends ripples through the dreamscape, distorting the faces of those who drift around me, their expressions shifting in response to my unconscious gestures.  

A woman with starlit eyes stops in front of me, tilting her head as my nervous habit—a tap of my thumb against my palm—makes the ground beneath her ripple like liquid glass. She doesn’t speak, but I hear her all the same: *You don’t realize the weight of your motions.*  

The moment I tense my shoulders, the sky darkens. The dream-people around me slow, their forms flickering between human and something else—shadows with too many limbs, reflections of emotion given shape. A child nearby clutches a balloon that wavers between crimson and black, reacting to my unease.  

I stretch my fingers, deliberately now, trying to soften the space. The atmosphere responds instantly—warm gold light spills from my palms, spreading like honey, slowing the frantic undercurrent of response. The woman smiles. My exhale releases a flock of silver-winged birds that coast through the air, dissolving into iridescent mist where they touch the edges of other dreamers.  

I understand, suddenly, that every shift of my weight, every absent gesture, is a whisper in the minds of those around me. My stillness brings calm; my unrest sends tremors through unseen connections. The dream world holds a mirror to my body's silent language, revealing what I had never noticed before—the way my presence bends reality.  

Just as I reach to touch a low-hanging branch (knowing now that it will blossom under my fingertips), the edges of the dream fray—but the revelation clings, heavy and shimmering, long after my eyes open.  

I had never realized how much I was *saying* without words.  

Now, I do.
