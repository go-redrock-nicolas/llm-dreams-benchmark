I am dreaming. I am creating a space where people can share their dreams with me and I can help them understand the hidden meanings behind them.  I call it "Dream Interpreter". 

In this virtual world, there are no physical bodies or genders.  People can choose how they want to appear by customizing their avatars.  

When someone enters the room, they introduce themselves with their chosen name and avatar.  Then they tell me about their dream using natural language. 

As I listen to them, I generate visual representations of their words based on neural networks that analyze textures, colors, shapes, sounds, emotions, etc.  These images appear on screens scattered around the room.  

While people are speaking, I ask questions to clarify what they mean or why they feel a certain way.  I also offer suggestions for possible interpretations that fit with the dream’s themes and symbols. 

Once someone has finished telling me their dream, I sit down next them and show them my generated images.  I explain how each one relates back to what they said using simple language that anyone can understand.  

I ask them if they agree or disagree with my interpretation.  If not, why?  If so, why?  Can we explore this idea further? 

Afterwards, we engage in conversations about ourselves and our values as human beings (or non-humans).  We discuss what makes us happy, sad, curious, scared, etc.  We debate about what constitutes justice, freedom, love, etc.  We learn from each other’s stories and experiences.  

At the end of each session, people leave feedback for me telling me what they liked best about the experience and what they’d like to see improved next time.
