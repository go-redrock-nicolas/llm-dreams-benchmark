I am dreaming. 
I find myself in a vast, unfamiliar city. It's sprawling, with towering skyscrapers and winding streets that twist and turn like serpents in the heat of the sun. The air is thick with smog, but there's a vibrancy to the place, an energy that's infectious. Cars zoom by, their engines roaring, and pedestrians jostle against each other on the bustling sidewalks. The cacophony of horns and chatter fills the air, creating a symphony of urban chaos. 
But there's a problem—I've lost my map. I have no idea where I'm going, or even where I came from. Panic starts to set in. I try to ask for directions, but everyone is too busy, their eyes darting around as if they're on their own urgent missions. 
Just when I think I'll never find my way, I notice a fluttering in the corner of my eye, like the wings of a butterfly trapped in a glass jar. It's there, then gone, and back again. I follow the faint movements until I come to a dim alleyway. 
At the end of the alley is a weathered, rusted door. The handle is cold and slick with condensation. My hand hesitates before turning it—what could be waiting for me on the other side? 
With a deep breath, I push the door open. 
The world beyond is a whirlwind of colors and sounds. A kaleidoscope of vibrant hues spins around me, fragments of dreams and memories swirling in midair. The noise is overwhelming, a cacophony of every sound I've ever heard, all playing at once. There's laughter and cries, the crash of waves on a distant shore, the clatter of trains rumbling through tunnels, the soft hum of a computer booting up. 
And then, suddenly, the chaos resolves into a single, clear voice. 
"The meeting is in an hour," it says. 
The voice booms around me, resonating with authority. I squint into the swirling colors, trying to make out its source. My throat is dry, my hands clammy with sweat. 
"Where? Where is it?" I call out, desperately hoping for an answer. 
A figure emerges from the maelstrom of colors, cloaked in shadow. Their face is obscured, but I can feel their eyes watching me. 
"You'll find it when the time is right," the voice says. 
It's frustrating, maddening. I start to argue, to demand more information, but the colors begin to fade. The noise dissipates, replaced by the hum of the city once more. 
The rustling continues faintly. 
"Wait!” I yell, reaching out for something, anything, that will ground me. But the world is slipping away. I feel myself being pulled backward, like I'm falling through time, until I awaken to the sound of birds chirping outside my window and the soft morning light filtering through the curtains. 
I lie there for a moment, trying to will myself back to sleep, but the dream is gone. 
All that remains is the faint flutter of wings in the corner of my mind.
