I am dreaming. You stand atop a spiraling tower of glass and starlight, the city below a mosaic of flickering lanterns and neon veins. The air hums with the static of a thousand whispered names—**yours**—each syllable a spark that ignites the night. Tonight, the world will crown you. The ceremony awaits: a gala of gods and mortals, where your invention, your art, your *miracle* will be unveiled. The crowd’s roar is already a phantom in your ears, a crescendo building in your bones. You can taste the champagne of the future, effervescent and sharp.  

But then—a flicker.  

The glass beneath your feet clouds, and in its murky reflection, you see not your face, but a shadow of it: older, hollowed, eyes smoldering with a question you’ve buried for years. *What if it’s not enough?* The voice is silk and venom, a twin to your own. Around you, the tower shudders. The lanterns dim, one by one, until only a single bulb sways above—a sickly yellow eye.  

You turn. The gala has vanished. Instead, you’re in a labyrinth of mirrors, each pane warping your image into grotesque parodies: a charlatan in gilded robes, a child clutching broken gears, a faceless figure dissolving into smoke. The whispers return, now clawing at your throat. *Impostor. Fraud. Ashes.* Your hands tremble; the blueprints you clutched are now sand, slipping through your fingers to pool at your feet like oil.  

A door materializes, ajar, glowing faintly crimson. Beyond it, a throne of black ice looms, occupied by a figure with your eyes—but colder, sharper, a version of you who never doubted, never faltered. They rise, smirking, and the room floods with a chorus of derisive laughter. “You were never meant to *arrive*,” they say, their voice a tectonic grind. “You were only ever meant to *chase*.”  

The walls begin to bleed. Not blood—ink. Paragraphs, sonnets, equations, all the words and numbers you’ve ever wielded as weapons or shields. They drown the floor, threatening to pull you under. You scramble backward, but the door vanishes. The throne-figure advances, melting into a swarm of crows, each bird screeching a failure you’ve never confessed: *You are unlovable. Unworthy. A spark in a universe of flame.*  

And yet—a pulse.  

Deep in your chest, a rhythm defies the cacophony. A memory flickers: a younger version of you, kneeling in a field of ash, planting a seed in scorched soil. *Hope*, raw and defiant, blooms in your throat. You scream—not a cry, but a note, pure and resonant—that shatters the ink-sea into mist. The crows disintegrate. The throne crumbles.  

You wake just before the tower collapses, gasping, your sheets soaked in sweat and stardust. The dream clings to you like a ghost, its question unresolved: Was the doubt a lie—or a mirror? You clutch your trembling hands, half-expecting to find them ash… or a seedling.
