I am dreaming. I rise briskly from a slumber as subtle cues streak across my consciousness - sirens wail at a distance, casting an eerie cadence into the stillness of the night. Shadowy figures dart across darkened streets, their hurried motions suggesting a frantic, if not ominous, purpose.

Amidst the hushed urban backdrop, the metallic clang of distant construction reverberates.  A stabbing realization starts to dawn on me as unsettling details interlock into a grim pattern. Stumbling boroughs lay ahead, and an invisible risk grows more palpable.

I rise to my feet and head cautiously toward the source of this perceived threat. The flicking flashlight illuminates a path lined with abandoned storefronts and vacant lots. Silence blankets the world; there is no comforting ambient din of nightlife. The air feels thick, oppressive. An uneasy foreboding creeps under my skin as adrenaline starts to surge.

At last, piercing light spills into a cleared square.  Frantic voices echo violently in the distance.  Fighting the urge to flee, I take a hesitant step forward, straining for details. Suddenly there - eated in grimy glass windows several stories high - a warning. Blazing bold:  "ABANDON ALL HOPE." 

My stomach lurches as I realize there's no cry of warning yet-the impending peril still lurks unseen, and we're all just unwitting lambs treading too closely to the slaughter.

I snap awake in a cold sweat, the remnants of dread trailing behind like decaying chains. And for just a fleeting instant before full consciousness, an uneasy thought rattles inside my mind: what if the dream was foretelling a hidden truth?
