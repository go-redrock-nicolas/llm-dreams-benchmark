I am dreaming. # The Depths Below the Surface

I've been maintaining a calm exterior while experiencing intense inner turmoil. When this emotional facade finally cracks, I find myself standing on a glass platform suspended over an endless ocean. The surface beneath my feet begins to spider with hairline fractures—each one representing a suppressed feeling, a hidden truth, a buried pain.

The glass gives way and I plunge into waters impossibly blue and clear. As I sink, I notice my clothes dissolving, transforming into swirls of color—reds of rage, blues of sorrow, yellows of fear—all the emotions I've kept contained now visible, tangible around me.

The descent continues past coral formations that whisper memories in voices I recognize: parents, friends, lovers, strangers whose lives briefly touched mine. Each formation pulses with bioluminescence, casting shadows that dance across my skin.

Deeper still, the water darkens to indigo, then violet, then a black so profound it seems to absorb light rather than merely lack it. Yet I can see perfectly. Floating in this abyss, I encounter a mirror version of myself, but this reflection smiles when I frown, weeps when I laugh.

"I am everything you hide," it says without speaking.

The mirror-self extends its hand, and when our fingers touch, our boundaries dissolve. We merge, becoming neither one nor two but something whole. The ocean around us begins to drain upward—water defying gravity, streaming toward the surface in reversed waterfalls.

I am carried within this impossible current until I breach the surface, gasping not for air but for understanding. The sky above is filled not with stars but with tiny windows into moments of authentic connection in my life—times when my exterior and interior were briefly, gloriously aligned.

As dawn approaches in this dreamscape, these windows rain down as warm droplets on my skin, each one whispering: "Remember this feeling. Carry it with you when you wake."
