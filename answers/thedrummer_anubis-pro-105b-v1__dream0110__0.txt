I am dreaming. I've risen through grueling qualifiers to the championship match that represents the culmination of my life's ambition. As I prepare for the defining moment, I step into the grand stadium, its sprawling steps a rainbow of colors. Muted murmurs hush throughout vast halls. Memories of my childhood stir, when I first saw the martial arts masters demonstrate their skill at the county fair. I was awed by their fluid poses and smooth movements. 

The day of the final match approaches. I spend every waking moment training. I work to train harder than anyone. I start each day at 5 a.m., beginning training for hours and ending right before noon. Then I trained throughout the night, only stopping to eat and drink water. I do this for months. 

Soon the day of the championship match arrived. I was well-prepared, having given everything to my training. Despite the tough training, I was in the best physical and mental shape ever. 

That day, I stepped into the martial arts stadium, the stage for my lifetime achievement. The stadium was huge, and the audience cheered. I enjoyed the applause. My fans threw discovered red and white confetti. Joy and delight made my heart feel light.
