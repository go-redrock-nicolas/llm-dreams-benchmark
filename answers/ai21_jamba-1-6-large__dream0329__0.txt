I am dreaming. I am in a dimly lit forest, the air thick with mist and the scent of damp earth. Towering trees, their bark gnarled and ancient, surround me, their branches intertwining above to form a canopy that blocks out most of the sky. A faint, eerie glow emanates from patches of luminescent moss clinging to the roots and rocks scattered on the forest floor.

I walk cautiously, my footsteps muffled by a carpet of fallen leaves and soft moss. There’s a sense of urgency, though I don't know why. My heart pounds in rhythm with the distant, echoing drumbeat that seems to pulse from the very ground itself. Every now and then, the wind carries whispers that almost sound like words, but they're just beyond understanding.

I come across a fork in the path, each way equally cloaked in shadow. To the left, the path seems clearer, lit by faint flickering lights that resemble candle flames, leading toward a faint glow in the distance. To the right, the path is darker, more overgrown, with an almost tangible tension in the air. I feel pulled toward the right, as if something unseen beckons me, yet the left offers a sense of security.

Just as I decide to take the darker path to the right, I hear a voice—clear and commanding—calling my name from the lighter path to the left. I turn toward it, but the voice fades as quickly as it came. I hesitate, unsure which way to go, knowing that time is somehow running out.

Suddenly, from the corner of my eye, I catch a glimpse of movement. A figure—human-like, but unnaturally still and silent—stands just beyond the treeline. Its eyes, glowing faintly in the shadows, meet mine, and it gestures subtly toward the darker path. My chest tightens, my mouth goes dry. Something about its presence feels both familiar and dangerous, a mix of warning and invitation.

I take a deep breath, and step forward onto the right path, not knowing what lies ahead. The forest grows quieter, the air heavier. Now, there’s no turning back.
