I am dreaming. 

I find myself repeatedly attracted to situations that ultimately cause me pain. Recognizing this self-destructive pattern, I want to break it. 

I want to try something new. I want to explore a world without rules or restrictions. A world where dreamers can make their own decisions and live their own lives. A world thatâ€™s completely different from the one they know in reality. 

Can you help me? Can we create this world together?
