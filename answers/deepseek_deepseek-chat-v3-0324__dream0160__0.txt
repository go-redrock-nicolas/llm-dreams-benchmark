I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of burning paper and ink, swirling around me like ghostly remnants of every contract, every script, every promise that has ever slipped through my fingers. The ground beneath me is unstable—not quite solid earth, not quite water—but some shifting, murmuring substance that whispers my failures in a thousand overlapping voices.  

A storm rages overhead, but the lightning is not light—it is the flash of camera bulbs, the harsh glare of headlines declaring my downfall. Each bolt strikes the ground near me, leaving behind smoldering fragments of old reviews, tweets, and tabloid covers that twist into grotesque shapes before dissolving into the hungry earth.  

Ahead, a towering door looms, its surface etched with the faces of every person who ever said, *"You’ll never work in this town again."* Their mouths move in silent unison, repeating the words like a cursed incantation. The door is cracked open just enough to reveal a blinding light—not warm, not welcoming, but the searing white of an interrogation lamp.  

I step forward. The ground liquefies, pulling at my feet like quicksand made of rejection letters and broken handshake deals. My limbs grow heavy, but I keep moving, because what else is there to do?  

Then—a sound. A single, clear note cutting through the storm. A voice, familiar but indistinct, calling from beyond the door. Not my name. Not any word I know. But something deeper, older. A sound that doesn’t belong to this place of ruin.  

I reach for the door. The faces scream.  

I push through.  

And then—  

I wake.
