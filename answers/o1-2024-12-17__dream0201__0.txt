I am dreaming. …feel your stomach clench with apprehension. You’re submerged in a realm of damp, echoing silence broken only by the soft sputter of your flickering torch. The catacomb walls loom around you like great stone ribs in the belly of a long-dead monster, slick with moisture that glistens when your light sputters back to life, only to plunge you into darkness once more. You cannot tell if you hear the quiet drip of languid water or the shy whisper of ancient spirits flitting through the blackness. The air is thick, a stagnant museum of centuries passed, stale yet humming with an unspoken promise—or perhaps a threat.

With each faltering flicker, the corridor elongates in your mind’s eye. Shadows slither along the cracked bones of the walls and ceiling, for a moment forming shapes that remind you of symbols you’ve only seen in forbidden tomes. The floor is uneven and fraught with loose stones; each footstep yields a crunch that seems to reverberate for miles. You feel as if you’re trespassing in a domain that has not known light or human voice for a thousand years, a place saturated with the memory of ancient rituals and hushed secrets.

You press onward, heart pounding. Your breath catches as the torch sputters again—time slows to a murky crawl in that small eternity before the light recovers. In that strangled hush, you catch faint echoes like whispered warnings: a drifting moan, a hiss of breath just behind you. You can’t be sure, and doubt gnaws at your mind. Adrenaline surges through your veins, shooting tingling waves to your fingertips. Part of you yearns to drop the torch and run, but you know you’d be swallowed whole by the darkness if you did.

Though the torch valiantly sparks back to life, its glow seems weaker now, the flame dancing like a firefly in twilight. As you venture deeper, the walls recede to reveal a yawning chamber. Cobwebbed relics crowd the edges—massive statues with missing eyes, altars caked in grime. A pungent odor rushes forward, a thick swirl of decay that stings your senses. The swirling dust motes flicker between visibility and oblivion, mixing with the torchlight to create airy, dancing phantoms. It feels as though the entire room is breathing slowly, exhaling centuries of stagnant air.

Before you, in the center of this immense tomb, stands an archway engraved with illegible glyphs. They twist and coil in patterns that seem almost alive, like serpents winding around one another. The flicker of your torchlight makes them writhe and shimmer in the gloom. There’s an uneasy magnetism about it, something pulling you closer despite the pounding alarm in your chest. You slide a trembling hand over the rough stone, and in that moment, a single gust snuffs out the torch completely. Darkness. Absolute, primal. Your heart thunders against your ribs, and you realize you can’t tell if your eyes are open anymore or closed. 

A sensation drifts through your mind: what if, in this depthless dark, something else has opened its eyes, the occupant of these ancient halls awakened at last? You stand there, torch extinguished, heart hammering, an intruder in a land forgotten by time. Unseen currents of fear swirl around you, and though the archway stands only inches away, it might as well be a mile. There is stillness. Then, in the corners of your consciousness—or the catacomb itself—something stirs, casting a spark within that black void. And, in the emptiness, you can’t be sure if the faint glow you sense is real… or just another trick of your mind in this dreambound labyrinth.
