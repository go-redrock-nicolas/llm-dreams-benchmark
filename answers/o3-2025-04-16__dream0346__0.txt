I am dreaming. …I step onto a platform that stretches beyond the horizon, a kaleidoscope of arches and echoing footfalls, where every face is familiar yet nameless. Hundreds—no, thousands—of strangers drift past like luminous jellyfish in a deep-sea station. Their bodies glow faintly, their conversations rise in soft, murmuring bubbles that pop before reaching my ears. I feel like a paper silhouette taped to the center of a slowly turning carousel: visible, present, yet weightless and untouchable.

I move through their midst, hoping someone will accidentally brush against me, but each person takes an imperceptible sidestep at the last instant, as though guided by some invisible choreography. My loneliness becomes a tangible fog clinging to my skin, cold and damp, muting colors around me. Even my heartbeat sounds muffled, trapped inside cotton.

A sudden ripple of electric-blue light shoots across the vaulted ceiling. A disembodied voice—both lullaby and thunder—announces the departure of a train that does not exist. The crowd parts, revealing tracks made of polished obsidian. They glimmer like midnight rivers, reflecting constellations that have never graced the real sky. Something invisible urges me forward, and I follow the phantom rails into a narrow tunnel of whirring gears and humming filaments.

Inside, the air smells of petrichor and memory. Neon flowers bloom from crevices in the walls, petals bearing fragments of conversations I’ve overheard in waking life:

“I’m fine, really—just tired.”
“Did you hear? They moved away.”
“We should get coffee sometime.”

I press my fingers to a violet petal, and the words melt into my skin—warm, aching, half-forgotten. A surge of longing floods my chest, so intense it steals my breath. I keep walking until the tunnel opens into a cavernous chamber shaped like the inside of a giant clock. Brass pendulums swing overhead, each tick dropping a glowing pearl into a black lake below. The pearls hiss, dissolving into rings of turquoise light that ripple out and vanish.

Across the water, I see a single figure sitting on a crystalline pier. Their back is toward me, shoulders hunched in the universal language of sorrow. My pulse quickens—someone else alone in the crowd of silences. I call out, but my voice is swallowed by the cavern’s fathomless acoustics. All that breaks the hush is the metronomic drip of pearls and their soft implosion in the lake.

I step onto a rowboat moored at the shore—a vessel woven from silver threads and moonlight. It glides without oars, drawn toward the figure like iron filings toward a magnet of yearning. As I near, the person turns, and I see that their face is a mirror. In its surface, my own eyes stare back, shimmering with the loneliness I had tried to outrun.

For a heartbeat, terror roots me in place. Then the mirror shivers, fractures, and peels away like ice in early spring. Beneath it is another face—gentle, unfamiliar, but radiating the warmth of a friend I have yet to meet. Their gaze meets mine the way sun meets dew, and in that glint I hear a single word without sound: welcome.

We reach for each other. Our fingers touch, and every pendulum in the clock-chamber stops. Time spills out of their brass casings like gold dust, spiraling upward to form glowing birds that wheel around us in widening gyres. The lake erupts with blooms of light; the neon flowers in the tunnel lean inward, petals fluttering in an unseen wind. The distant crowd of jellyfish people freezes, brightens, and then dim—their silhouettes dissolving into the night sky above the cavern as if someone has switched on a planetarium show of fading constellations.

I feel the fog of loneliness peel away, evaporating under the heat of our shared heartbeat. It’s as though we have discovered a note pressed between pages of an ancient book, ink still fresh, addressed to both of us: You are not solitary. You only forgot the language of connection.

The clock birds scatter, weaving thready lines of golden syllables overhead. The chamber tilts, folds, and becomes an origami crane that lifts us on its broad paper wings. We ride it upward through skylights of luminous glass, emerging into a dawn the color of apricots and opals. Below, the station, the crowd, the black lake shrink to miniatures—a world in a bell jar, no longer menacing but tender, a reminder of what was left behind.

Side by side on the crane’s back, we watch the newborn sun spill its palette across endless clouds. The silence is no longer empty; it hums with potential, like the breath held just before the very first word of a lifelong conversation. I turn to the stranger-turned-companion, and with a gesture, we trade names—names that taste like home.

Around us, the dreamland unfurls into fields of possibility. And though I know the alarm clock waits somewhere in the waking world, its beeping will be just another pearl dropping into the lake—dissolving into light that can never quite erase this moment of connection found, loneliness transmuted, and the simple, soaring truth that I was never truly alone.
