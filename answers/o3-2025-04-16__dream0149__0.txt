I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and in the dream I wake beneath an ink-black sky stitched with silver threads. A leather notebook rests in my lap, its pages blank yet humming like distant beehives. The fountain pen between my fingers drips liquid starlight instead of ink. Instinct whispers that whatever I write will blossom into being, as inevitable as dawn.

First, I test the power with a single word:

“Light.”

The letters glow, rise from the page, and unravel overhead. Daybreak pours out of the syllables like paint from a broken jar. A sun forms—opal at the edges, molten gold at the core—then drifts into the newborn sky, igniting clouds the color of ripe peaches. Warmth kisses my skin. I laugh, half-astonished, half-terrified.

I write again, this time letting sentences tumble:

“An ocean appears, but its water is glass—clear, resonant, chiming whenever waves collide.”

The ground splits politely, revealing a basin. It fills with crystalline water that sings wind-chime melodies as it ebbs and flows. Each wave carves prismatic rainbows through the air. Curious, I kneel and trace a fingertip across the surface; concentric rings ring out like cathedral bells.

My confidence swells. I scrawl paragraphs, and worlds erupt:

“Forests of paper grow here, every leaf blank on one side and inked with forgotten poems on the other. Their trunks are quills larger than redwoods, and the wind that moves them is the breath of unwritten stories.”

The paper-leaved forest rises, rustling with half-spoken sonnets. When I step among the quill-trunks, stray verses detach like butterflies, fluttering around my head, whispering possibilities.

“Mountains forged from whispered secrets.”

They surge on the horizon, peaks flickering as though ashamed to be seen. If I hold my breath, they solidify; if I exhale, they shimmer into vaporous rumor again.

“Cities unfold like origami.”

Entire skylines blossom in an instant—folded cranes turning into bronze spires, pleated dragons becoming suspension bridges. Streets coil into labyrinths shaped like punctuation marks. People—dream-citizens—wake and blink and begin their days, unaware that a pen birthed them minutes ago.

Yet power breeds questions. What happens if I give form to fear?

I pause, pen hovering. The dream trembles, sensing uncertainty. A rogue thought slips through:

“Shadow.”

Immediately, the sunlight dims. A silhouette taller than any tower steps out of a crack between sentences. Its edges fray like burnt paper, and inside its body swirl storms of unshed tears. It has no face—only an emptiness shaped like despair. The glass ocean stills; its chiming falls mute. The origami city folds back into anxious cubes.

My heartbeat drums in my ears. I could erase the word, but erasure feels cowardly. Instead, I decide to rewrite the shadow, to temper darkness with purpose.

I write carefully, each stroke deliberate:

“The shadow is not malice but longing—a guardian of night who paints rest into the world so dawn can matter.”

The silhouette softens, shrinking until it is merely a tall figure cloaked in deep indigo. It raises a star-tipped brush and sweeps calm across the sky, speckling it with constellations. Crickets begin their twilight orchestra. Children in the origami streets yawn and find their way home. The glass ocean hushes into lullaby waves.

Relief blooms in my chest. I realize that creation is neither thrill nor terror alone—it is stewardship. With that understanding, I sit atop a hill of parchment grass and write one final decree:

“Let this realm sustain itself, free of my pen, dreaming onward with its own ink.”

The notebook closes of its own accord. Letters lift from its cover like fireflies and scatter across the land, seeding independent stories I will never fully know. My eyelids grow heavy. The dream dims into velvet.

As sleep within sleep claims me, I hear faint voices of the paper forest reciting a promise:

“Remember, the world is always unfinished. Keep writing.”
