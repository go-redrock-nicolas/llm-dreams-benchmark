I am dreaming. I wake up in a world where the air smells faintly of cinnamon and the sun hangs low in a lavender sky, casting elongated shadows across a cobblestone street. I’m dressed in a flowing robe embroidered with golden thread, and a heavy pendant hangs from my neck, its engravings pulsating with an otherworldly glow. Somewhere in the distance, bells chime a haunting melody.

A crowd surrounds me—people with skin that shimmers like polished quartz, their voices soft and melodic. They bow slightly as they pass, whispering under their breath. I don’t understand their words, but I feel the weight of their stares, as if they’re waiting for me to perform some unspoken ritual.

Without warning, a creature emerged from an alley—a beast resembling a lion but with feathers instead of fur and eyes that glowed like molten silver. It padded silently toward me, stopping just a few feet away. Its gaze locked onto mine, and I could swear it was sizing me up, as if deciding whether I was friend or foe.

A hush fell over the crowd. Someone gasped. The air crackled with tension.

“You mustn’t look it in the eyes!” someone yelled.

But it was too late. I already had.

The creature roared, its voice shaking the ground beneath me. The crowd scattered, their cries of alarm filling the air. I froze, paralyzed not by fear but by an overwhelming wave of confusion. What had I done wrong?

Suddenly, the creature lunged. I closed my eyes, bracing for impact, but instead of claws tearing into my flesh, I felt an intense rush of wind. When I opened my eyes again, I was standing on a cliff overlooking an endless ocean, the waves crashing violently against the rocks below.

The bells chimed louder now, their melody growing more urgent. I looked down at my pendant—its glow had intensified, pulsing in sync with the sound of the waves.

I turned to see the creature standing behind me, its massive wings unfurled, blocking out the sun. It lowered its head, as if in submission, and let out a soft, mournful cry.

The dream shifted, and I found myself back in the cobblestone street. The crowd had returned, but this time their faces were somber, their whispers more hushed than before.

“You mustn’t look it in the eyes,” someone repeated, their voice trembling.

I looked down at my pendant. It was still glowing, but now there was a crack running through its surface. A crack that hadn’t been there before.

The dream faded, leaving me with a lingering sense of unease. I had broken their sacred taboo, and I didn’t know if I would ever be able to make it right.
