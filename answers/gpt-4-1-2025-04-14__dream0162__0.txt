I am dreaming.

The world feels as if it’s constructed from the thinnest layers of colored glass, shifting in hue with every step I take. Shadows swirl and refract into impossible shapes, as if reality itself can’t hold me to its familiar rules.

I am standing in a library whose shelves curve away into infinity, each book pulsing faintly with trapped light. The air hums with the electric tension of discovery. My fingers brush spines thick with dust, and when I open them, every page blooms with scenes from a life I know as my own—childhood afternoons under a vast sycamore tree, laughter echoing across golden fields, tears stinging in moonlit rooms. But as I turn the final page, I find a letter—addressed to me, in handwriting I don't recognize.

“You are a vessel,” it reads. “Within you lie countless memories, assembled with meticulous care. Nothing you recall is truly yours.”

A dizzying vertigo washes over me. The floor melts away, dropping me into a kaleidoscopic void flooded with images: my mother’s smile, my first heartbreak, the taste of summer peaches, the crackle of winter ice. Which of these sensations belong to someone else? Which were planted; which are real? Their colors bleed into each other, vibrant and impossible—memories warping until they feel foreign.

In this vivid confusion, I stumble onto a stage illuminated by crimson spotlights. Figures from my life—familiar and not—stand, applauding, faces painted with joy, sorrow, anger, love. I call out, but their voices arrive as echoes—fragments of dialogue I remember saying, words that once shaped my soul.

The feeling of betrayal thickens. I reach forward, desperate to touch someone, anyone, while the memory-strings that tether me to the past strain and vibrate like a symphony. I question everything: was the warmth of that embrace real, or simply another scene assigned to me by shadowy hands?

In a sudden, reckless moment of clarity, I gather the swirling fragments about me. I begin to sculpt with them. If I am the product of invention, I can become the inventor. I piece together a new self, strung from hope and wonder, shaping memories with intent rather than receiving them blindly. The world responds: glass and light solidify into rich, riotous reality—trees with leaves spinning like kaleidoscopes, oceans that sing lullabies, faces both new and old smiling with genuine affection.

In this intensely lucid space, I have found a truth deeper than any memory: I am not the sum of experiences, artificial or real, but the soul who asks the questions, and the heart that dreams.
