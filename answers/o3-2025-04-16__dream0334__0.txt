I am dreaming. …slow your breathing just enough to feel each rib expand like a hinged gate, opening into a garden you didn’t know existed beneath your skin. A faint warmth spirals up the inside of your arms, passes through your collarbones, and pools behind your eyes with the hush of distant surf. That is the first signal. The second is the soft tick-tick-tick in your ears, as though your pulse has begun to wind an invisible music box.

The room—or whatever surrounds you—ripples, then yields, the walls bending outward like sails snagging a sudden wind. Colors slide off familiar objects and pour across the floor as liquid light. Lavender pollen drifts through the air; each mote bursts with the chime of tiny bells when it lands on your skin. When you exhale, the breath leaves your lips as a silver ribbon, words you haven’t spoken yet curling in its shimmer.

A memory tries to bloom: the smell of petrichor, the coolness of wet granite, the thrum of a train passing under your feet. But it dissolves before you can name it, and in its place a corridor of knotted roots yawns open. You step forward barefoot and feel the ground pulse like the underside of a drum. Sap lights up inside the roots—veins of neon amber—tracking your heartbeat as though the forest itself has adopted your rhythm.

Ahead, a pool of still water waits, so dark it seems carved from night. You kneel beside it. Your reflection is fluid, unsatisfied with a single form: now the child you once were, cheeks full of untold questions; now a version of you draped in constellations; now a silhouette flickering with city lights. Every time you try to focus, the image glides away like a fish beneath ice.

You notice your shoulders trembling—not with fear, but with some tightly coiled anticipation. A hush gathers. The surface of the pool puckers, as if something is breathing just beneath. You press two fingers to the water. It’s neither cool nor warm; it is the exact temperature of recognition. At your touch, the liquid shingles outward, transforming into glass petals that float up and orbit your wrist like weightless shields.

When you rise, the sky has drifted inside the forest. Stars hang from branches like lanterns, their filaments humming softly. You open your mouth to ask how this reversal is possible, but the question escapes as a flock of iridescent moths. They scatter, carrying pieces of your curiosity on powdered wings.

Somewhere deeper than thought, you understand: every step you take changes the architecture of the dream. The path will not pre-exist; it will unroll only beneath the faith of your footsteps. And so you begin walking again, barefoot on starlight, trusting the tremor in your bones to steer you. With every inhale, the horizon glows wider; with every exhale, your body grows lighter—until gravity is a suggestion you no longer accept.

You push off the ground. The forest drops away. Air grows viscous, a syrup of moonlit blues, and you swim upward through it, arms sweeping tides of slow brilliance. Far above, the sky opens like a pupil widening, and inside that aperture waits another dream, warmer and wilder, ready to be threaded to this one.

But before you enter, you feel one last pulse—an echo of your waking heart. Your eyes flutter against the brittle film of dawn. You realize you can choose: step through and forget the world that sleeps in your bed, or spiral back, carrying the taste of galaxies on your tongue like a secret seed.

You hesitate. The dream holds its breath with you.

Then, with a smile no one sees but the stars, you decide.
