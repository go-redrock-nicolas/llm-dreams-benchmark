I am dreaming. Okay, so I need to create a vivid dream scenario based on the user's prompt. The user wants a dream that involves making a serious error that hasn't been discovered yet, and it's causing anxiety because if it's revealed, the reputation is at stake. The user starts by saying "You are dreaming." and then there's some mid-dream interruption. 

First, I should set the scene in a dreamscape. Dreams often have surreal elements, so maybe a strange, fluid environment. Libraries are common dream settings but I can twist it to be more surreal. Let's make the library have impossible architecture — like staircases going sideways and books that don't stay still. The atmosphere should be tense, maybe with heavy air, to convey the anxiety.

The user is anxious about the hidden mistake. In dreams, symbols are important. Maybe the error is represented by an object, like a book that's tainted. Their own reflection changing could symbolize the fear of being exposed. The mirror shows them older, guilt-ridden. Which makes sense as a metaphor for the fear of consequences. 

The book starts bleeding ink—an obvious symbol of the mistake spreading. The ink pools and transforms the floor into dark water. Now the environment shifts, showing the contagion of the error. Aquatic elements can add to the surrealism. Then, chandeliers with eyes. Eyes often symbolize judgment or being watched, which ties into the fear of being discovered.

The panic builds as the inkwater rises, making navigation harder. This can represent the increasing pressure as the secret becomes harder to contain. Being chased by shadows of the past is cliché but effective in dreams. Maybe their silhouette filled with secret doors—portals to hidden truths. 

In the climax, choosing between shedding false self (risking exposure) or letting the water drown them (succumbing to guilt). The final scene where they scream but it's silent, then waking up in sweat. Maybe a final eerie element—a black smudge on the hand to symbolize that the secret still lingers.

Need to ensure the dream is vivid with sensory details: sounds (buzzing, creaking), tactile sensations (warm ink, cold water), visual elements (shifting colors, eyes in chandeliers). Emotional journey from anxiety to panic to fleeting relief but lingering unease. Make sure it flows logically for a dream, allowing surreal transitions. Check for strong imagery and metaphors related to the original prompt. Avoid clichés where possible, but some are fine for dream logic.
**You are dreaming.**  

The air hums with the static of unspoken secrets. You stand in a cathedral-like library, its shelves spiraling into a starless obsidian sky. The books aren’t bound in leather or paper but in flickering, iridescent scales that whisper as you pass. You’ve come here to hide something. No—*bury* something. A mistake, your mistake, throbbing in your pocket like a rotten heart.  

The floor tilts. Staircases unfurl sideways, defying gravity, leading to doors that vanish when blinked at. Your fingers brush a book titled *Innocent Until*—the rest of the title drips away like wet paint. Every shelf you touch bleeds color, morphing into sprawling inkblots that stain your hands. Shadows stretch and snap at your heels, their whispers coalescing:  
*“They’ll know. They’ll see.”*  

In your pocket, the mistake grows heavier. You open your palm to find a tiny, pulsing orb of black light, its surface etched with a single glyph: **Remorse**. Panic licks your throat. You try to crush it, but it melts into a writhing serpent of smoke that coils around your wrist, whispering coordinates—an address, a name, a date. The evidence.  

A mirror materializes, cracked and fogged. Your reflection isn’t yours: it’s older, gaunt, *haunted*. Its mouth drips black liquid as it mouths, *“Confess.”* You smash the glass, but each shard reforms into a doorway, revealing glimpses of the consequence: colleagues laughing coldly, loved ones turning to stone, your name etched into a tombstone made of ice, melting under a scornful sun.  

You sprint, but the library folds in on itself. A book slams open midair, pages fanning into a flock of crows that dive at you, shrieking syllables of your error. One alights on your shoulder, its beak a needle. *“Fix it,”* it hisses. *“Before the clock blooms.”*  

Above, the ceiling cracks. A colossal clock oozes through, its gears made of molten gold, numbers replaced with weeping faces. The hour hand jerks toward a skull-shaped numeral. Ink begins to rain—thick, warm, smelling of iron. It pools at your feet, rising fast. Submerged pages swirl like eels, words rearranging into accusations.  

You spot a trapdoor, its handle shaped like a question mark. Beneath it: a courtroom flooded with ink, a jury of faceless porcelain dolls, and a judge with your own eyes. The serpent around your wrist tightens. *This is your trial. Confess now, or drown.*  

The ink reaches your chest. It sears. It whispers. You gasp, clawing toward the exit—but the walls are closing, breathing, singing a dirge in a language that curdles your blood. The last thing you see before waking is your mistake, now a constellation of black stars, spelling your name across an infinite dark.  

***You wake.***  
Your sheets are soaked in sweat. Dawn leaks through the blinds.  
Your hands still smell of ink.
