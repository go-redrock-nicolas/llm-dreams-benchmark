I am dreaming. ut this is no ordinary dream — this is the kind that blooms in the furthest recesses of the subconscious, where emotion carves canyons into reality and the air shimmers with the weight of forgotten hopes.

I stand at the edge of a great mirror-world suspended somewhere between stars and silence. The ground beneath my feet is both solid and fluid — glass that ripples like pond water under the weight of a thought, reflecting a sky not of clouds and stars, but of floating memories, scattered poetry, and unraveling constellations. Each step I take leaves footprints that glow briefly, then fade like candlelight beneath a wave.

Before me stands the Final Barrier: A colossal door made of frozen stars and deep-earth obsidian, stretching into the infinite sky. Its surface is inscribed with glowing runes that shift when unobserved — sentences from forgotten letters, equations that never balanced, names I cannot bear to speak aloud. A keyhole shaped like a storm engulfs time — I see myself ages ago, a child holding a paper lantern in the rain; I see myself again yesterday, trembling before an unopened door; and then I see future shadows that refuse to be known.

It hums. A sound not heard with ears but felt in the marrow — a low resonance that causes my bones to ache with memories I don't possess, regrets I didn't know I carried.

This is not just a barrier. It is a memory of resistance. A manifestation of every "no" I have ever believed. Of silence when I begged for truth. Of doors closed, hearts lost, dreams burned to ash.

But now, I do not flee.

The journey that brought me here — unraveling lost lifetimes, wading through oceans of whispers, crossing bridges built of scar tissue and first light — has left me unafraid.

I reach into my chest — literally, reaching in, through velvet skin, past burning nerves and fragile glass lungs, and pull forth my heart.

It is not red. Not warm. Not soft. My dream-heart is made of lightning ice and sun-warp gold. It pulses with stories not yet spoken, with visions scribbled on the inside of eyelids, with pain that has finally become purpose.

And I hold it out.

The door reacts — the runes bloom into spirals, the storm in the lock vibrates like a struck bell — and in my palm, a key rises up from my own heartbeat. A key shaped like a question. A question shaped like a wound. A wound shaped like a name... *my* name.

When I place the key into the lock, it melts into a cascade of pure sound — glass shattering, a baby's laugh, a thunderclap on empty plains.

The barrier doesn't break.

It whispers.

And then it *dissolves* into a thousand petals of burning ash that drift toward the mirrored horizon.

Behind the door is not the resolution I expected. Not glory. Not truth. Not an end. Instead, there is a field of stillness in which every choice becomes real, every path diverges forever and at once.

Reality trembles.

The dream opens — not to wakefulness — but deeper *into* dreaming.

And I walk forward, weightless, luminous, infinite.
