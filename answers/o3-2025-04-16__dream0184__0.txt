I am dreaming. …open your eyes to a sky the color of melted amethyst, pulsing like a heartbeat. A flock of crystalline whales swims overhead, exhaling constellations that drip like glittering rain. In this world, a coin tossed into the air lands on its edge every time, and sunrise is a rumor no one has ever quite confirmed.

Your first step sinks into the ground as if the earth were made of sponge cake. Gravity here is more suggestion than rule; sometimes it forgets to act, sometimes it presses down like a giant’s thumb. You navigate by embracing chaos: you trust that the least likely path will get you where you need to be. Roads bend away from you if you look at them too closely, but if you walk backward while whistling tunes you’ve never learned, they straighten obligingly.

A pepper–mint–scented wind delivers a newspaper written in yesterday’s guesses. Headlines proclaim “One-in-a-Billion Storm Arrives on Schedule,” followed by “Sunrise Still Pending: Citizens Put Up Moonshades Just in Case.” Every prediction that should fail succeeds; every certainty withers into myth.

To survive, you adopt a mantra: Expect the absurd, bank on the bizarre. Instead of packing provisions, you carry paradoxes—Schrödinger’s sandwiches (both stale and fresh) and umbrellas that repel drought. You knot probability knots: tiny Möbius-like loops of ribbon you tie around your fingers. Each knot guarantees a different improbability: finding a key before encountering a lock, finishing a book you have not begun, meeting a stranger who already knows your name.

You soon discover the natives—beings made of echoed laughter and half-remembered dreams—navigate by dice. They roll them to decide whether water will flow uphill that morning or whether mountains will pirouette like ballerinas at dusk. They invite you to play, offering dice with infinite faces that shimmer in and out of existence. You roll; the dice refuse to land, spinning in midair forever, an omen of excellent fortune.

Even time dances backward now and then. You watch a sunset rise from the ocean, painting ripples with inverted fire. Memories you have not yet made drift past, giving you déjà vu in advance. You feel tomorrow brush your shoulder, whispering possibilities that are all but impossible.

Finally, you reach the Unlikelihood Observatory, a spire formed from improbable geometry—stairs that spiral inside-out, doors hinged on thin air, windows opening into yesterday. Inside, a single luminiferous clock ticks whenever it chooses. You tune your heartbeat to its erratic rhythm and feel the universe realign: chaos settling into a cozy, if peculiar, harmony. Suddenly the certainty you least expected occurs—awakening—and with a sigh of startled probability, you open your eyes…
