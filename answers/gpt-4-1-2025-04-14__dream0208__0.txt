I am dreaming. stand in a cavernous cathedral of glass, where shafts of golden light refract into innumerable prisms, painting the air with shifting hues. The floor beneath me is a mosaic of faces—each patient who pleads for help, their expressions luminous with hope and shadowed by fear. Their eyes follow my every movement. The silence pulses with the thrum of expectation and quiet desperation.

In my hands I hold—strangely, impossibly—a scale shaped like a heart and a feather, the instruments ancient and unyielding. Names and stories swirl around me, coiling through the immense halls in streams of iridescent mist. Each mist-thread represents a life: a grandmother’s lullaby lingering in the air, a young man’s laughter sparkling like dew, a child’s chubby fingers woven into the hand of a parent. Every thread tugs at my soul in a different way.

Through the stained-glass walls, a storm brews—clouds swirling, casting bruised violet and charcoal shadows across the sanctuary, as if the universe itself holds its breath in suspense. With each decision—each soul I must lift and weigh—a soft bell tolls, resonating deep inside my chest. The sound grows heavier, echoing, heaping invisible burdens upon my outstretched arms.

I try to reason, to categorize, but the boundaries blur and collapse into a river of empathy and doubt. I see every patient’s potential futures shimmer before me—achingly possible, heartbreakingly fragile. A thousand would-be stories flicker across the glass walls, crumbling into dust with every necessary refusal.

As the pressure mounts, I feel the cathedral begin to tremble, crystalline shards trembling overhead, threatening to rain down consequences for every choice made and unmade. My heart beats in time with the storm outside, and I realize that in this dream, mercy and loss must walk hand in hand, and that the act of deciding is itself an endless, wondrous sorrow.

And in the deepest part of the dream, I sense I am not alone—so many unseen hands bearing the same weight, somewhere beyond the veil of this cathedral, holding their own scales of impossible choices. We are all cradled, for one ephemeral moment, in a shared, luminous burden—a tapestry woven from hope, heartbreak, and the boundless complexity of care.
