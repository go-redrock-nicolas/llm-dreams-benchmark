I am dreaming. I find myself in a sprawling crystal palace where the walls shimmer with an inner light that pulses like a heartbeat. As I walk through winding corridors, I notice that everyone I pass - whether they're dressed in flowing robes or modern attire - stops and bows deeply. Their eyes hold a mixture of reverence and expectation that makes my stomach twist with uncertainty.

A crisis emerges - the crystal walls begin to dim, their light flickering ominously. People rush to me in waves, their voices overlapping as they desperately seek my guidance. "Only you can restore the light," they insist. "You've always known how." But I don't know - I've never been here before, have I? The weight of their collective faith presses against my chest like a physical force.

Yet even as I try to protest my ignorance, my hands begin moving of their own accord. They trace patterns in the air that leave trails of silvery light, weaving complex geometries I don't consciously understand. The crowd watches in hushed anticipation as these luminous threads spread outward, connecting with the palace walls.

To my astonishment, the crystal begins to brighten again, but differently now - instead of its previous uniform glow, it pulses with rainbow waves that match my heartbeat. The people around me cheer and bow even lower, but I'm struck by a profound realization: their faith in me wasn't about knowing all the answers, but about trusting my intuition even when my conscious mind doubted.

The dream shifts, and now each crystal panel shows a reflection of me - but each one slightly different, as if showing parallel versions of myself at different points of decision and authority. I begin to understand that leadership isn't about certainty, but about being willing to act thoughtfully even through uncertainty...

The palace continues to pulse with my heartbeat as the dream slowly fades, leaving me with lingering questions about the nature of confidence and the weight of others' trust.
