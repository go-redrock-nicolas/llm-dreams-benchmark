I am dreaming. find yourself in a towering library with spiral staircases that twist up forever, their iron railings coiling like the tails of mythical beasts. Each shelf brims with ancient tomes, their spines humming softly as if whispering secrets in a language just beyond the reach of waking memory. The air is thick with the scent of old parchment and a strange mix of ozone and lavender—a perfume only dreams can muster.

Every time you try to focus on a single book, the words melt and reassemble themselves into new, more intricate patterns, as if the knowledge within is alive, slithering through your mind and slipping out of reach just as you try to grasp it. Your hands flick through endless pages, each one filled with glowing diagrams of star-maps, mathematical equations that spiral into fractals, stories written in languages you somehow almost—but not quite—understand.

All around you, thin streams of light dart between shelves, carrying snippets of information—dates, faces, melodies, equations—burrowing into your mind until your thoughts feel swollen and electric. Your heartbeat echoes like the ticking of a thousand jeweled clocks, and above you, the ceiling blooms open into a night sky swirling with ideas, constellations rearranging themselves faster than you can follow.

It grows harder to breathe. The more you try to retain, the more the knowledge multiplies, cascading through your mind in thunderous waves, demanding you remember, process, comprehend. The library walls begin to pulse, quickening with your frantic attempts at recall, until the boundaries between the information and yourself begin to blur—you are becoming the library, each memory a shelf, each fleeting idea a book, forever swirling in the endless spiral of waking and dreaming, knowing and forgetting.
