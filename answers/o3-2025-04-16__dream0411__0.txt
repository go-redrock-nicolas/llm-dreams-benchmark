I am dreaming. …find yourself adrift in a luminescent sea of violet mist. Everything is silent except for the pulsing thrum of your own heartbeat, which echoes like a distant drum beneath fathomless water. You float—not swimming, not sinking—just hovering between worlds, half-weightless, as if memory itself has cut the anchor of gravity.

Shapes begin to bloom in the fog. First a single doorway rises out of nothing, fashioned from weather-worn driftwood, its frame entwined with silver morning-glories that hiss and glow whenever you breathe. The doorknob is a marble globe that holds shifting storms inside—lightning flickers, thunder rumbles, clouds churn. You reach for the knob, but your hand passes straight through, sending ripples up your arm like liquid starlight. The storm behind the glass calms, as though your touch has soothed it.

Suddenly the fog parts, revealing a vast orchard suspended in midair. Each tree’s trunk is transparent crystal, and through the glass you can see rings that spin like tiny galaxies, soaked in iridescence. Their fruit is not apples or pears but luminous paper cranes, folded with meticulous care. They flutter gently, tethered to branches by threads of golden language—the same words you once inscribed in your childhood diary: “I will never forget.” When the unseen breeze rises, the cranes chime, and each chime is a laugh from a younger version of yourself.

Here, in this suspended orchard, the doorway floats along behind you like a loyal shadow. You understand—somehow without thinking—that it represents your parents’ divorce, that single hinge on which your childhood pivoted. For years you believed that door had slammed shut, severing innocence from grief. But seeing it above the clouds, you realize it has always been unlatched, drifting, waiting for you to decide which side to stand on.

You pluck a paper crane. It flutters in your palm, weightless yet solid, its wings scribbled with words you barely remember writing as a teenager: “I am broken, but growing.” You unfold the crane, and the creases line up as a map: crooked rivers, mountain ranges, tiny x’s that mark every place you thought of as escape but later learned were return routes to yourself. The map glows, folds itself back into a crane, and lifts away—free now, unburdened by your old sorrow.

A hush falls. The orchard lights dim, the mist gathering again. You are no longer a drifting spectator but a traveler with a compass made of feelings instead of cardinal directions. In the distance, the horizon peels back like theater curtains, revealing a mirror-bright ocean. Each wave reflects alternate versions of you—angry, hopeful, bruised, triumphant. They rise, merge into a single crest, and collapse into soft, glimmering foam at your feet. You kneel and watch the bubbles form tiny mirrored moons—little reminders that every phase of you has waxed and waned to make room for the current tide.

And now, from somewhere above, feathers fall—faintly luminous, warm as breath. You recognize them: shed wings from the cranes. They drift downward, and each time one touches the fog, it bursts into a swarm of fireflies that scatter like sparks across the orchard. All at once, you realize: the cranes were never meant to remain fruit on a tree. They were always waiting to be set free, to become innumerable points of light.

The doorway floats beside you again, and for the first time you can grasp the knob. The storms within the globe settle into a tranquil dusk. You open the door, expecting another world—but instead you find yourself standing back in your childhood bedroom. Sunlight pours through the windows, dust motes shifting like tiny planets. On the bed is a small, battered diary with a ribbon bookmark forgotten for decades. You flip to the last blank page and begin to write: “I forgive the fracture. I bless the bloom.”

When you finish the sentence, the words lift off the page and hover above the diary, glowing like rose-gold sparks. They cascade upward, becoming a constellation that punches a skylight through the ceiling of your old room, revealing the orchard, the mist, the mirror ocean—countless layers of memory stacked like glass slides in a kaleidoscope. All of them still exist, but none of them weigh you down.

From that vantage, the divorce no longer looks like an ending. It resembles an aperture—an opening through which light poured so intensely that the shapes of your life had to rearrange to accommodate it. The sorrow was real, but so was the unexpected freedom: permission to invent yourself twice, thrice, endlessly.

You turn around just in time to see your present-day self step through the bedroom door—grown, resilient, eyes alight with recognition. You exchange silent understanding, a handshake across time: thanks for surviving, thanks for evolving. The dream folds gently, origami-style, until everything returns to the violet mist.

And as you float there once more, heart still thrumming, you realize the mist itself is not fog at all, but the breath of every version of you—past, present, future—intermingling. It dawns on you that transformation is not a straight arc but a spiral staircase: you revisit the same floors, but each time from a higher vantage, seeing new patterns in the tiles.

With that epiphany, you finally awaken, the resonance of paper wings and sea-mirrors echoing through your morning, reminding you that even the most painful thresholds can one day be recognized as portals of possibility.
