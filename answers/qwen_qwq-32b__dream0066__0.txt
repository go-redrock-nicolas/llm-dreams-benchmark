I am dreaming. I'm trapped in an elevator that's filling with water. The panic rises sharply, my breath catching in my throat like a tangled spider web. My hands claw at the mirrored walls, slick with condensation and now the cold kiss of the rising current. The lights above flicker, casting jagged shadows that writhe like eels. A distant siren wails, but it might just be the whine of my own strained pulse.

The water reaches my waist. I fumble for the elevator's broken 'Emergency Call' button—static greets my frantic palms. A glint catches my eye: a keycard clutched in my drenched sweater pocket. Gold script glows faintly on its surface. *Floor 13. Unlock.* 

Wait. Floor 13? The building schematic I memorized had only twelve floors. My fingers grip the card, and the numbers on the elevator's panel melt into liquid mercury. Suddenly, the doors *screech* open, not to a hallway, but to a starless ocean abyss. 

A figure floats into view—translucent, shimmering with bioluminescent veins. Its voice is the creak of old wood beneath waves: "The ocean wants what the sky fears." It extends a hand made of liquid pearl. "Choose: drown here... or breathe below."

The elevator plunges with a shudder. I plunge forward, into its glow.\Boundary\n
