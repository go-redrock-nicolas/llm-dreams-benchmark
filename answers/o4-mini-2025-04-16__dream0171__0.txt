I am dreaming. You stand backstage in a cavernous auditorium whose air shimmers with anticipation. Every breath tastes of roasted coffee and polished wood. Through the curtain’s narrow slit you glimpse rows of seats filling up—each occupied by people whose faces gleam with expectation: silver-haired board members, sharp-suited investors whose eyes flicker like polished gemstones in the soft torchlight. Your pulse hammers, and you clutch your laser pointer like a lifeline.

Stepping into the pool of spotlight, you sweep your notes out with a trembling hand—only to realize, with a dread so cold it claws at your spine, that every chart is miscalibrated, every projection off by an order of magnitude. The elegant graphs you practiced so many nights over have dissolved into jumbled scribbles that mock you. The cavernous hush swells until it feels like the walls are breathing. A distant echo of applause fades as you stand frozen, the first slide glowing behind you: a flaming comet of error codes racing toward oblivion.

In that heartbeat of terror, the room warps. The polished lectern stretches upward into a living tree, its bark etched with glowing equations you don’t recognize. The audience melts into a spiral of ink-blots that unfurl into doors: each portal bearing a fragment of the correct data you need. They swirl in midair, pulsing like bioluminescent jellyfish. You realize you must chase these fragments through the dream’s shifting halls to reconstruct your presentation before the audience—those great marble-eyed judges—demands your downfall.

You sprint down a corridor lined with towering mirrors, each reflecting a different version of your speech. One mirror shows you calmly reordering your slides. Another shows you bursting into tears, abandoning the stage forever. You brace a palm against a mirror’s cold surface, willing it to yield the right memory. With a shuddering breath you smash through—and tumble into a sun-drenched meadow where giant daisies whisper corrections in golden pollen. Each petal unfurls a precise number or fact. You gather these floating blossoms into a glass jar at your waist.

Suddenly, the meadow dissolves, and you’re back onstage—only now you hold the jar of glowing petals. The audience leans forward, silent but expectant. Heart racing, you uncork the jar. A halo of flower-powder drifts over your projector, and the erroneous slides recalibrate themselves: lines snap into accurate trajectories, tables shift into perfect alignment. The deck refocuses like a lens coming into crystal clarity. You inhale the sweet, electric scent of victory and begin to speak—your voice steady, enriched by the dream’s surreal magic. As each corrected slide unfurls, the room pulses with nods, soft murmurs of approval like distant waves breaking on sand.

Then the dream begins to fade, colors bleeding at the edges. You stand alone on that stage, footsteps echoing in a quiet vastness, clutching both your jar of daisies and the now-perfect presentation. As the spotlight dims, you wake—heart still drumming—but carrying with you the vivid promise that even in the darkest moments of error, imagination can bloom solutions more brilliant than any chart.
