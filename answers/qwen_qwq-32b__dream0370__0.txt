I am dreaming. The scene unfolds like a brushstroke of midnight across an indigo sky, surreal and serenely electric. I’m standing in a cathedral of whispers, where the walls breathe in tidal rhythms, each breath echoing with voices from every age. The air hums with the scent of petrichor and jasmine, mingling like secret lovers in the damp. A lone figure glides toward me, their form dissolving and coalescing like smoke caught in moonlight. Their eyes... hold galaxies in their irises, swirling with the chaos and calm of a trillion souls. A tear falls—no, not a tear, a comet’s tail—trailing stardust that clings to my skin, burning a memory into my bones. They speak, but no sound escapes their lips. Their words hang in the air like constellations, mapping a lexicon of unspoken sighs. I reach for them, my hand passes through vapor. The ground begins liquefying, turning into a river of liquid obsidian. As I float downstream, the cathedral fractures into origami cranes that dissolve upon touching the water, each fold whispering a truth I never knew I carried. Awakening soon, but the imprint of that touchless touch lingers—my ribs ache with the weight of stars.
