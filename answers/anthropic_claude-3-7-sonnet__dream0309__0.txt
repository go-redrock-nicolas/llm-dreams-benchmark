I am dreaming. I find myself standing on a glass bridge suspended between two towering cliffs. The bridge shimmers with iridescent colors as if made from soap bubbles frozen in time. Below me, an endless sea of clouds churns, occasionally parting to reveal glimpses of an ancient forest.

I'm dressed in a suit woven from achievements—diplomas and awards forming the fabric, late nights and sacrifices stitching the seams. It feels heavy yet comfortable, a second skin I've grown into over years of striving.

Across the bridge stands a figure cloaked in shifting smoke. Their features change constantly—sometimes resembling my childhood mentor, sometimes a stranger, sometimes wearing my own face.

"Those clothes," the figure speaks, voice echoing strangely. "You wear them proudly."

"I made them myself," I answer. "Thread by thread, year by year."

The figure laughs—not unkindly, but with knowing that unsettles me. "Did you spin the thread? Did you create the loom? Were you born with hands that could sew?"

The bridge trembles beneath me. Wind catches my carefully constructed garment, revealing golden threads running through it I never noticed before—connections, opportunities, moments of fortune I hadn't acknowledged.

"Your diligence is real," the figure continues, approaching. "But so is the wind that filled your sails."

I want to argue, but suddenly remember the teacher who stayed late, the stranger who mentioned a job opening, the parent who paid for lessons, the friend who introduced me to the right person.

"Both can be true," I whisper, fingers tracing the golden threads now glowing brighter. "I worked hard. And I was fortunate."

As I acknowledge this, my suit transforms—no longer a heavy armor of justification but a luminous garment showing both my efforts and my blessings intertwined, inseparable.

The bridge beneath me dissolves, but I don't fall. Instead, I float, suspended between agency and grace, finally understanding I never needed to choose.
