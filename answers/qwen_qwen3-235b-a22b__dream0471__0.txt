I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a kaleidoscope of impossible geometry—a city built on the spine of a slumbering leviathan, its streets pulsing like capillaries, ferrying crowds of faceless figures who sprint in place, never moving. You are among them, clutching a satchel that grows heavier with every breath. Inside it, clocks tick backward, spilling gears and constellations, while scraps of paper flutter—each a promise you’ve made: *“I’ll help you rebuild your house by dawn,” “I’ll sing the stars into silence tonight,” “I’ll mend the cracks in your teacup heart.”* You feel the weight of a thousand unspoken yeses, a gravity that bends your spine like a question mark.  

A neon river surges beside you, its currents whispering your name in a thousand voices. You wade in, hoping the water will dissolve the burden, but it only hardens the satchel into stone. Your legs sink into silt that smells of forgotten vows. Above, the sky fractures into stained glass—a mosaic of eyes, all watching, all waiting. You try to explain: *“I didn’t mean to promise the moon to everyone. I didn’t mean to swallow the sun.”* But your voice splinters into moths, fluttering uselessly at the edges of your throat.  

Then, a thread of gold pierces the chaos. A child emerges from the crowd, their skin aglow with bioluminescent constellations. They hold a mirror made of frozen starlight. “You’ve been carving pieces of yourself for everyone’s puzzle,” they say, their voice the chime of distant glaciers. “But you’re not a piece. You’re the whole sky.” They press the mirror into your hands.  

You see yourself—not as a martyr of kindness, but as a wildfire, a symphony, a storm. Your edges blur and sharpen. The satchel cracks open, releasing a flock of paper cranes that dissolve into smoke. The leviathan’s spine shudders, and the city folds like origami into a seed. You kneel, pressing your palms to the earth, and feel roots erupt from your fingertips, drilling deep into the planet’s molten core.  

A new landscape blooms. A garden, but not one you control. Vines twist into archways where your “no” hangs like ripe fruit, sweet and unapologetic. Rivers reroute themselves to avoid your feet. The sky softens into a tapestry of dusky purples, threaded with comet trails that spell your name in a language only you understand. The faceless crowd pauses, their shadows bowing before dissolving into dandelion fluff.  

You stand, lighter than breath. Where once you carried the world’s demands, now you cradle a single ember—a boundary glowing like a newborn star. The child grins, their teeth glinting like moonlit shark fins. “The universe doesn’t need your surrender,” they hum. “It needs your sovereignty.”  

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue and the echo of a vow: *To protect the sacred wilderness of your own soul.* The dream lingers, a blueprint etched into your bones—a reminder that saying “no” is not a fracture, but an act of creation. You are no longer a beggar at the feast of your own life. You are the host, setting the table only for what nourishes you.  

And somewhere, in the marrow of reality, the leviathan rolls over in its sleep, smiling.
