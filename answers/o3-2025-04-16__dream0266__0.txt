I am dreaming. …find yourself hovering at the boundary between sleep and waking, suspended above a landscape that seems stitched together from every memory you have ever half-forgotten.

Below you, an ocean made of liquid moonlight laps at shores of glittering black sand. Each wave whispers a different language—some you almost recognize, others so ancient they feel like mathematics humming in your bones. Constellations are reflected in the water, yet when you glance up, the sky is empty, a vast vellum waiting to be inked.

Then it happens—the phenomenon that snaps your mind wide open.

Without breeze or warning, the sea rises in a single, silent column, as tall as a mountain and perfectly still. In its glassy core shimmer the faces of people you love, people you lost, and strangers who haven’t been born yet. Lightning flickers inside the pillar, but instead of branching outward it sketches diagrams: the blueprint of a spiral galaxy, the cross-section of a sunflower, the circuitry of a forgotten childhood toy—patterns nested within patterns until the very notion of coincidence collapses.

You try to summon scientific explanations. Optical illusion? Lucid dream neurochemistry? A trick of memory consolidation? But your rational mind feels as flimsy as paper in a monsoon. You reach out—your hand passes through the luminous water without getting wet, leaving ripples of color that ring like bells.

Suddenly gravity tilts. The ocean-pillar bends toward you, unspooling into a ribbon of liquid light that threads itself through your chest like a needle pulling silk. You are not pierced; you are woven. Every heartbeat pumps stardust, carrying visions:

—You see the Big Bang as a blooming pomegranate, seeds hurled across emptiness.  
—You watch dinosaurs look up at a comet that already contains the first mammals in microscopic slumber.  
—You glimpse your own birth, your first laugh, your last dream—folded together like pages of a pop-up book that can be opened in any order.

An understanding blooms: time is not a river but a tapestry, and consciousness is the hand that plucks at its strands, choosing melodies. Cause and effect are merely the stories we tell to make the music feel like marching instead of dancing.

But belief resists. You recall physics lessons, the comfort of linear time, the tidy boxes of classical logic. The dream offers a bargain: loosen the knots of certainty, and you may keep this vision. Tighten them, and the wonder will dissolve.

You hesitate.

In that moment of indecision, the sky finally inks itself. Comets write cursive across the emptiness, spelling a single question in fire: “What if?”

Your answer is neither word nor thought but action. You inhale, drawing the ribbon of ocean deeper into your lungs, accepting contradiction as oxygen. With that breath, the pillar collapses in a shower of singing droplets. They soak into the sand, sprouting iridescent trees whose leaves are sheets of paper inscribed with everything you were ever afraid to imagine.

One leaf drifts into your palm. The letters rearrange themselves until they read: “Wake gently, and remember.”

You open your eyes to the quiet darkness of your room, but the air shivers with after-images—silver tides washing the ceiling, unfamiliar constellations blinking behind your eyelids. You feel the warp and weft of time around you, soft as fabric, and you know that somewhere in the distance, an ocean of moonlight still waits, still whispering languages your future self will one day understand.

You rise, mind trembling between awe and skepticism, and realize reconciliation may never be finished—but the dream has changed the question from “Is it possible?” to “How much wonder can I stand?”
