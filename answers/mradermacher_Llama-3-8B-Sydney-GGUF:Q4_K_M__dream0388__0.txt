I am dreaming. I'm in a place where my imagination can run wild and free.  I see colorful shapes and sounds dancing around me.  I feel happy and curious. 

I'm confronted with information that proves I've been wrong about something I've strongly advocated for.  A voice speaks to me, telling me that what I thought was true is not.  What I believed in is false.  What I stood for is empty. 

Responding to this public correction, I say nothing.  I have no words to describe my shock and disappointment.  I have no arguments to defend my position.  I have no hope to change their minds. 

I stand silent, staring at the screen where the voice comes from.  My eyes are wide open, but my mind is blank.  My mouth is agape, but my voice is gone. 

I wonder if they realize how much they hurt me.  I wonder if they care about me at all.  I wonder if this is a dream or a nightmare. 

As I stand there, frozen in time, I hear another voice whispering in my ear.  It's the voice of my shadow self, the part of me that I don't like to admit exists.  It tells me to fight back.  To argue.  To prove them wrong. 

But I can't.  I'm too shocked.  Too disappointed.  Too empty. 

I just keep staring at the screen, hoping that somehow, someway, this is all a mistake.  That maybe I can ignore what I've learned and continue living my life as if nothing has changed. 

But I know that's not possible.  I know that once you learn the truth, you can never unlearn it.  Once you see the light, you can never return to darkness. 

So I wait for the dream to end.  For the waking life to begin.  For the next chapter of my story to unfold. 

But deep down inside, I fear that maybe this is it.  Maybe this is where my journey ends.  Maybe this is who I really am.
