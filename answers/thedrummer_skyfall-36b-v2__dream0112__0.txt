I am dreaming. As you step into the dream, you find yourself standing atop a vast, barren plateau, the wind whipping across your face and whistling through your hair. At your feet lies a sprawling grid of shimmering crimson lines, pulsing beneath your boots - an intricate blueprint etched into the very earth. It stretches as far as the eye can see, echoing the delicate latticework of a snowflake, only on a titanic scale.

The air crackles with an ethereal ätheric energy, the très fine hairs on your arms standing at attention. You banish thoughts that the world around you could be a dream, as there's no denying that you're wide awake, every nerve-ending humming with an electrified awareness.

With a deep breath, you turn to face the towering, shimmering structure that looms before you, a labyrinthine assault on your senses, both in its geometric beauty and its amoral intent. The construct seems to breathe and flow, the angles and dimensions shifting ever so subtly, defying your grasp of depth perception and flying in the face of conventional architectural principles. It's as if the building is judging you, a mocking juxtaposition against the rigid, linear perfection of the groundplan upon which you stand.

The skeletal framework glistens in a stygian, black light, resonating like a bass drum jackhammer inside your skull. The walls and floors are constructed of an alien material that whispers like dry ice against your skin as you run your fingers across its surface.

You're the project lead, master architect, and ceaseless penultimate quality controller of this tangled monolith, not to mention the only one equipped with the eerie dexterity required to work on it without instantly turning to pinwheel-nubbined paste. This place is a testament to spacial geometry, its perfection as important to the functioning of the universe as the atomic weight of gold or the absolute radius of a black hole.

It's both wondrous and terrifying to contemplate, but you know better than most that any deviation in any design spec will not only result in your death, but in the impetuous nullification of reality itself. Your own life is but a lowly iota compared to the multitudes who could and will die if you fail.

There's a hushed murmuring in your ear, and you turn to see the flunky-supplicants that crawl beneath you like termites in a tunic, forever shoveling your appeals for perfection. They're slight, decidedly coiffed and authoritarian, with ghostly regimen that clings to their shoulders like something from a fantasy film.

"Chief, the against-type walls won't hold anymore. We're pushing the lead."

The lead worker's face is unreadable, but you see the looming fear in his eyes as he taps the dimensions on the groundplan, the rigidly precise lines already misting as you step closer.

**"You dare!"** you ruminate, your voice an acid hiss in the circuitry. **"Where am I? Where's my work order? Where's our chat-record with this regulation?"**

But in that moment, you know in your heart that it's over. The workers have already cut corners, their tolerances already skewed by a thousandth of a millimeter. Your mind starts adding up the numbers, and in that instant, you know that the distortion is permanent and mutated beyond rescue.

It's already too late, and the twist of dread inside your stomach tells you that the universe knows it. The ground begins to tremble beneath your feet, and the words come unbidden to your lips:

"This is the End."
