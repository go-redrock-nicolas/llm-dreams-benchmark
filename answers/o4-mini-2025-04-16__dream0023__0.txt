I am dreaming. A swirl of misted light floods my vision as I sit at an impossibly long glass table, its surface rippling like water under a phantom breeze. Before me stand three delicate hourglasses, each one half-empty and humming with a low, urgent resonance. Their sands glow gold, silver, and copper. I feel their pulse in my chest—three projects, each demanding my full attention, each boundary snapping tighter around my thoughts.

Time flares. Papers drift in from every direction, phosphorescent like jellyfish. Graphs and memos shape-shift into wings and flutter out of reach before I can grasp them. I stretch, trying to catch them, but the more I chase, the more they multiply, weaving a barrier around me. My heart thumps in cadence with the dripping of unseen clocks. The walls breathe, expanding and contracting, so I can never settle.

Then, from the shadows beyond the table, my supervisor appears—an elegant figure with four arms and eyes like polished amber. In one hand, they hold a crimson envelope that pulses like a living thing. Without words, they hand it to me. As I touch the seal, a tremor runs through my dreamscape, and I realize: a fourth task has just been added. A cold thrill races along my spine.

Immediately, the hourglasses shift: sands pour faster, tumblers spin. The desk beneath me transforms into a sloping crystal ramp. I slide downward, clutching the crimson envelope. The other three tasks burst into flame above me, their fires mirrored in the supervisor’s eyes. I try to speak—my voice cracks like a snapped string.

I land in a vast kaleidoscopic atrium where the deadline clocks hang from invisible wires, each face screaming the hours in Morse code. The fourth envelope throbs with heat in my hands. I sense the project inside is alive, coiling like a snake, demanding immediate feeding.

My ribs tighten; I feel as if I’m made of glass, ready to shatter. Yet beneath the panic, a strange calm unfurls. With trembling fingers, I break the wax seal. A soft blue light streams out, unraveling a ribbon of notes and plans. I catch it midair and suddenly understand: each task is a thread in a tapestry I alone can weave.

I stand tall in the atrium’s center. The four sets of glowing sands—gold, silver, copper, and a new sapphire—hover around me like planets aligned. With a deep breath, I begin to move, weaving the ribbons of paper into patterns only I can see. The clocks slow. The flames around the original three tasks flicker into warmth instead of frenzy. My supervisor’s many-eyed gaze softens into a smile of approval.  

Then I wake—or rather, I drift upward toward the ceiling of my dream, free of tables and timers, floating in a constellation of tasks finally woven into shimmering harmony. And as I hover there, I carry the echo of every ticking grain of sand, every flicker of flame, and the knowledge that even in the richest depths of overwhelm, I have the power to create order from chaos.
