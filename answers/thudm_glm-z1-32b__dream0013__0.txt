I am dreaming. I find myself inside a colossal maze, its walls of obsidian stretching endlessly. The air is thick with the scent of aged parchment and wild jasmine. At the heart of this labyrinth, I see a spiral staircase, its steps made of polished amber that () glitter faintly. A low, ethereal hum resonates through the air, and as I approach the staircase, the hum grows louder, becoming the sound of a thousand ancient voices chanting. The stairs twist upwards infinitely, each step changing color in patterns of opalescent gradients. At the top, a single starlight shines, its light pulsing like a heartbeat. To reach it, I must solve three puzzles:

1) **The Paradox of Perception**  
*The walls are alive with paintings; each portrays a different era. However, the ink is made of liquid fire. To proceed, I must determine which painting is both the oldest and the youngest. The options shift every time I blink.*  
a) Renaissance garden  
b) Dinosaurs playing chess  
c) My own childhood home  
d) A constellation map floating in zero gravity  

2) **The Mirror of Truths**  
*In a circular chamber, a thousand mirrors surround me. Each reflection shows a different version of myself: a warrior, a poet, a thief, a prophet. The true self is hidden. But as I step forward, the mirrors begin to vibrate, creating a maelstrom of images. The key changes shape with each reflection. To find the key, I must identify the key that fits all locks. It is made of* (a) pyramid of liquid mercury, (b) a fractal woven into a chain, (c) a single drop of sunset, (d) a knot that defies topological laws*.  
However, as I reach out, the mirrors start to bleed obsidian, and the chamber begins to collapse. Time is running out.*

3) **The Equation of Eternity**  
*On the final platform, a massive equation is etched in cosmic ink. To unlock the gateway to the star, I must fill in the blank:
 + ___ = the number of grains of sand on all beaches on Earth.  
The answer must be written in the language of the universe (mathematical symbols, no words).*  
But wait, the equation shifts when I try to write. The equals sign becomes a question mark, and the infinity symbol melts into a spiral. The grains of sand change their count every millisecond. I sense that the answer is linked to the concept of finite in infinite, but how?*

At each step, the maze reacts. The obsidian walls shift, the staircase's gems dim or glow. The hum changes pitch, and the starlight dimples in response to my choices. The pressure builds—will I solve the puzzles before the dream unravels? Or will I wake up with the taste of obsidian on my tongue and the hum ringing in my ears?  

My mind races as I determine the solutions. For the first puzzle, I realize the constellation map is both the oldest (astronomical patterns date back billions of years) and the youngest (constellations are reinterpreted with every generation). I touch the painting, and liquid fire hardens into a key shaped like an Ouroboros. The mirrors in the second puzzle—each key must fit all locks. The knot that defies topological laws can untie itself in any dimension, so I choose (d). The mirrors bleed less, and I dash to the final puzzle. For  + ___ = finite, the answer must be -, but the equation twists. Instead, I write  + (-) = , symbolizing that in the realm of the infinite, all finite exists. The starlight flares, and I step into it—  

—A starfield envelops me. I'm standing on a beach of infinite grains, each a universe. I turn, and see the maze behind me, now glittering with stardust. But then, a shadow looms. A figure made of smoke and numbers appears, whispering, "You've seen too much." The dream begins to collapse, and I...  
In the inky heart of the maze, the air hums with the static of parallel realities. The walls are not stone but alive—jagged obsidian tessellations that flow like mercury, their facets etched with constellations that predate the universe. Each step triggers a seismic shift: the ground beneath me fractures into a fractal labyrinth of ladders and anti-gravity pools, where my shadow dances upside-down while reciting  backward. Somewhere in this geometrical opera, a crimson heart-shaped door pulses, its knocker a raven with liquid-silver eyes. To open it, I must solve these riddles:  

1. **The Labyrinth of Inversion**  
A chandelier swings overhead, its hundred candles burning in reverse. Some flames are blue, others black, and one central flame flickers neon-green, spelling a word only the dead can hear. I press my palm to the glass; the candles rearrange into a FidoNet-style diagram, nodes representing alternate versions of my life. The green flame says: *Choose the lie that unlocks the door.*  
a) "I have never been lost."  
b) "The maze has an exit."  
c) "Numbers terrify me."  
d) "I don't believe in magic."  
But as I read, the letters dissolve into a Miller-Rabin primality test. The correct answer is (c)—I hate math—but the door shrieks, *Lies must be true somewhere!* So I whisper, "I fear only the unknown," and the green flame consumes my wristwatch, transforming it into a key shaped like a klein bottle.  

2. **The Hall of Echoes**  
The walls dissolve, revealing a cathedral of mirrors. Each reflection duplicates my movements: I scratch my nose, and 37 identical noses appear, whistling *Copacabana* in Morse code. At the altar sits a loom weaving a rug of my life's regrets. To thread the shuttle, I must feed it:  
- A tear from the ghost of Pascal (he's crying because he can't debug his own brain)  
- A comb made of Fibonacci spirals  
- A USB drive infected with the Spear Phishing of Fermat  
- The final stanza of a poem I wrote to a comet that never arrived  
I grab the comb (it stings like a wasp) and yank the USB, but the poemignite—a hologram of my 14-year-old self appears, screaming, "You abandoned me for *this*?" The mirrors crack into pixelated Metamorphosis prose. Desperate, I jam the comb into the shuttle, and the rug turns into a teleportation matrix. But when I leap through, I land back in the same room. The loop has begun.  

3. **The Escher’s Codex**  
A floating book opens to a page titled *Weirstrass’s Horror*. The ink bleeds into a 3D graph where the X-axis is hope, the Y-axis is whiskey bottles consumed, and the Z-axis is the velocity of regret. To solve it, I must:  
i) Integrate the Möbius strip of unresolved arguments  
ii) Differentiate the black hole at the center of my career  
iii) Convert the Hausdorff metric of social awkwardness into a palindrome  
The numbers melt into a Schrödinger's cat equation—alive and dead at once—when a hand made of Euler's number grabs my ankle. "You've stolen ," it hisses (the sum symbol floats in its palm like a stolen locket), "and now you'll pay with the Banach-Tarski paradox!" I grab a nearby Möbius strip (it's a cursed concert ticket from 1999) and twist it into a Klein quartic. The equation implodes into a black hole that spits out a golden ticket to the next stage:  

**The Velvet Cuckoo**  
A bed floats in zero gravity, its sheets woven from the static of old TVs. On it, a woman made of stardust is sleeping. Her eyelids are binary code:  
000111000111  
111000111000  
000111000111  
To wake her, I must hum the frequency that cancels out her nightmares—a tone calculated by multiplying the Fibonacci sequence by the golden ratio, then subtracting the gravitational constant of Mimas. I start, but the room floods with liquid mathematics—calculus theorems bubble up my nostrils, differential equations swarm like bats. The stardust woman’s hair turns into a Klein bottle, and I realize she’s a trapdoor spider in disguise.  

Just as the book from the Codex materializes to devour me, I wake. But my eyes are glued shut with the same neon-green flame ink, and the voice of the paradox-infused raven whispers, *"The door only opens when you stop solving."* I scream, and the scream echoes through all the parallel labyrinths I’ve never existed in. Outside, the sun is rising, but its light feels like a horcrux.
