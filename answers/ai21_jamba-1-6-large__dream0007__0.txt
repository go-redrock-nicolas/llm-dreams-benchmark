I am dreaming. I am in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of us, and we are at an impasse. My friend is standing across from me, their face flushed with anger and frustration. I can feel my own heart racing, my hands shaking with adrenaline. We are standing in a dimly lit room, the air thick with tension and unspoken words. The walls seem to be closing in around us, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and old books.
I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself. I know that I need to stay calm and rational, to listen to my friend and really hear what they have to say. I open my mouth to speak, but before I can say anything, my friend interrupts me, their voice rising in pitch and volume. They are shouting now, their words cutting through the air like a knife.
I feel a wave of frustration wash over me. I want to scream, to lash out and tell my friend how wrong they are. But I know that won't solve anything. I try to take a step back, to distance myself from the situation and think clearly.
But before I can do anything, the door to the room bursts open. A figure steps into the room, their silhouette backlit by the harsh glare of the hallway light. It's someone I've never seen before, but they seem to know me and my friend.
"You two need to stop," they say, their voice calm and measured. "This isn't helping anyone. You need to talk, to listen to each other."
I look at my friend, their face still flushed with anger. But there's something different in their eyes now, a spark of recognition and understanding.
"Maybe they're right," my friend says, their voice softening. "We need to work this out."
The figure steps forward, their face illuminated by the dim light of the room. They smile at us, their eyes twinkling with mischief and intelligence.
"Let's sit down and talk," they say, gesturing to a pair of chairs in the corner of the room. "I'll even make some coffee."
I smile, a weight lifting from my chest. Maybe, just maybe, we can work through this after all.
