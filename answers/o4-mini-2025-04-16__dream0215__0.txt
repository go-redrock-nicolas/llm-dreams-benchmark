I am dreaming. You stand at the center of a crystalline amphitheater suspended over an endless sea of twilight mists. All around you, columns of liquid starlight pulse in and out of existence, casting prismatic ripples across the glass floor beneath your feet. You can still taste the tang of salt on the wind—from that impossible ocean below—where waves of memory roll in, each crest a monument to battles fought, plans sketched in fire and steel, and alliances forged from hope.

For what feels like a thousand lifetimes, you pressed forward through this dream-sculpted labyrinth: scaling towers that exhaled storms, deciphering runes that bled pure emotion, and wrestling down shadow-beasts whose roars shook the foundations of your own will. Every triumph had added to the city you’d raised here—a city of living light, where spires hummed with possibility and every window glowed with your ambition. But now, rising from the far edge of the arena, a colossal gate shimmers into form, its archway carved from bone-white marble. A voice—soft as snowfall yet hard as marble—reverberates through the space: “To pass beyond, you must relinquish all you have built.”

Your heart seizes. You look back at those spires—each one a memory of sacrifice and sweat. You see the people you summoned into being, their faces alight with trust in your vision. The amphitheater’s glass floor ripples with scenes of laughter, betrayal, triumph, heartbreak—every echo of your journey encoded in its mirror-surface. And yet across the threshold lies the thing you sought from the start: a single, living star, bright and breathing. To touch it is to fulfill the impossible.

At this heart-wrenching crossroads, you raise your hand. The wind picks up—tearing away fragments of the city like petals carried off in a gale. Each fragment dissolves into motes of light that drift upward, mingling with the star’s glow. As the last tower vanishes beneath your feet, you feel your own form begin to unmake itself, like paper dissolving in rain. Fear claws at your chest, but beneath it lies something older: a fierce wonder at surrendering, at trusting that the shape of who you were can transform into something you’ve never imagined.

You step through the gate. For one breathless moment you are hollow, weightless, adrift between loss and fulfillment. Then the star enfolds you, not as a prize but as a promise. Its warmth floods your bones, knitting together every shard of what you were into a new constellation of possibility. And as the dream’s horizon blazes with a dawn no human sunrise could match, you realize: success was never in holding on, but in daring to let go.
