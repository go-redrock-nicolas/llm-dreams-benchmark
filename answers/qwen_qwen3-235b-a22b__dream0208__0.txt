I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You stand in a vast, inverted cathedral, its vaulted ceiling plunging downward like the throat of a leviathan. The walls are lined with shelves of flickering hourglasses, each grain of sand suspended mid-fall, glowing faintly like dying stars. Below you, the floor is a mosaic of faces—thousands of eyes, mouths, hands pressed into the tiles, all whispering in unison: *“Choose. Choose. Choose.”* Their voices hum like a swarm of cicadas, urgent and inescapable.  

A figure materializes before you, draped in a robe stitched from storm clouds. They press a silver scalpel into your palm, its blade etched with equations that shift and dissolve like smoke. “The sickle harvests only what the soil permits,” they intone, gesturing to a horizonless field beyond the cathedral. There, silhouettes rise from the earth—patients, tangled in roots, their bodies blooming with tumors that shimmer like opals. Some reach for you, their fingers crumbling to ash; others lie still, their breaths pooling in the air as luminous bubbles that burst with silent screams.  

You step into the field. With each footfall, the ground pulses—a living heart, arrhythmic and fevered. The scalpel vibrates in your grip, growing heavier with every second. A child appears to your left, their veins glowing turquoise, singing a lullaby in a language you’ve never heard but somehow understand: *“Cut the pain, but leave the song.”* To your right, an elder lies curled around a rusted key embedded in their chest, their skin a map of scars that writhe when you stare too long. Behind you, a mother cradles a newborn whose skin shimmers with the iridescence of a soap bubble, fragile and fleeting.  

The hourglasses above begin to shatter. Sand rains down, crystallizing into new patients as it hits the soil—more bodies, more pleas, more fractures in the air. The scalpel’s blade now drips a viscous gold liquid that hisses where it lands, sprouting thorned vines that your ankles. You realize: every incision you make will save one life but doom another. The child’s song falters; the elder’s key rusts further; the mother’s arms tremble as her child’s glow dims.  

A clockwork raven alights on your shoulder, its gears grinding. “Balance is a lie,” it croaks, pecking at your ear. “Every cure is a curse. Every breath stolen.” You glance down—the vines have bloomed into flowers, each petal a face frozen mid-scream. The scalpel’s handle splits open, revealing a coiled serpent biting its own tail, its scales etched with the names of every decision you’ve ever regretted.  

You wake just before the blade falls—but the cathedral remains, its whispers seeping into your bones. For weeks, you’ll taste the metallic tang of that gold liquid in your mouth, hear the child’s lullaby in the hum of streetlights, feel the phantom weight of the scalpel, still hungry.
