I am dreaming. The air around me hums with an electric tension, like the charged moment before a summer thunderstorm breaks. The world is painted in hues that don’t exist in waking life—indigo skies streaked with molten gold, trees with leaves that shimmer like shattered gemstones. I stand at the edge of a vast, rolling field of tall silver grass that rustles like whispered secrets, each blade bending in a wind I can’t quite feel against my skin.

Ahead, the ground slopes into a valley where a river of liquid starlight carves through the land, its currents swirling with constellations that flicker like fireflies. I know this place. Or rather, I *should* know it—it’s the landscape of past transitions, of thresholds I’ve crossed before. The bridges I built are still here: a fragile arch of woven light spanning the river, a path of floating stepping stones across a chasm I’d once feared. Yet now, my feet won’t move. 

The grass whispers my doubts back to me in a language older than words. *You did this before. Why can’t you now?* My hands clench at my sides, but when I look down, they’re translucent, flickering in and out like a candle in a draft. The rules have changed. The skills that once steadied me feel like relics in this shifting dream. 

Then, the wind shifts. The silver grass parts, and there—standing knee-deep in the star-river—is a figure made of shadows and sunlight. Its face is featureless, yet I recognize it instantly: it’s the part of me that’s always known how to adapt. It extends a hand, and in its palm floats a key shaped like a question mark, glowing faintly.  

"Remember," it murmurs, though its mouth doesn’t move, "the bridge isn’t the only way across."  

Above us, the indigo sky cracks open—not with lightning, but with laughter, brilliant and unburdened. And suddenly, the river isn’t a barrier anymore but a mirror, showing me not the struggle, but the self who’s already dancing in the currents.
