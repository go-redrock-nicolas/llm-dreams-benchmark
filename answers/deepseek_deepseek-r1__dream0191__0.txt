I am dreaming. I’m in a cave that just collapsed. The exit is sealed, my light is flickering... panic is rising. Need to calm down and find a way out.Okay, the user wants a vivid dream scenario where they're trapped in a cave after an earthquake. Let me start by setting the scene—deep cave, darkness, fear. I need to evoke sensory details. The smell of damp earth and iron... maybe the taste of blood from a cut. The flickering light adds tension. Wait, the user mentioned the light source is damaged, so maybe a flashlight with dying batteries. Sounds of the cave groaning—crumbling rocks, distant drips to create an eerie atmosphere. 

The user's panic is rising, so I should transition that into a moment of calm, then introduce a mysterious element. Bioluminescent fungi? That's a cool twist. The light appears as they touch the cave walls, guiding them deeper. Symbolism of fear and unexpected paths. Maybe the path twists into an unexpected sanctuary with cosmic elements—stars swirling, ancient ruins. A sense of being watched, but not menacing. A figure made of constellations to offer guidance. Then waking up with the lesson that challenges lead to hidden wonders. Make sure the imagery is rich but not too convoluted. Check the flow: panic, discovery, wonder, encounter, awakening. Add details like stones shifting underfoot, the hum in the air. Avoid clichés. Ensure the dream feels transformative, leaving a lingering sense of awe.
**Dream Sequence:**  
The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the metallic tang of something ancient — like rusted iron or old blood. Your flashlight flickers, its beam slashing jagged shadows across the cavern walls as you press a trembling hand to the rubble that now blocks the exit. Stones shift under your palms, sharp and unyielding. *No way back.*  

Then, darkness swallows the light entirely.  

Your breath hitches, echoing too loudly in the suffocating silence. But as panic claws up your throat, you notice it: **a faint, pulsing glow**, seeping through cracks in the cave floor. It deepens from murky indigo to a surreal violet, rippling like liquid starlight. You crouch, fingertips brushing the ground — and the stone *moves*. Not the earthquake’s violence, but a slow, deliberate unspooling of something alive. Bioluminescent fungi unfurl like serpentine threads, twining around your wrists, not to bind but to *guide*. They pull you toward a crevasse you hadn’t seen, a slender gap exhaling a warm, honeyed breeze.  

You squeeze through, skin grazing rock that hums as if charged with forgotten music. The passage widens into a cavern so vast your mind stutters. Above, constellations swirl in a false sky — nebulae bleeding colors that don’t exist in waking life: bruised gold, void-green, the searing pink of a newborn star. Below, a lake of obsidian glass reflects the cosmos, its surface fractured by wisps of mist that rise and twist into shapes — a stag with antlers of lightning, a woman’s fading laughter, a bridge of smoke.  

A voice, felt rather than heard, thrums in your bones: *"You sought an exit, but the cave breathes deeper truths."*  

At the lake’s edge, a figure materializes — neither human nor beast, but a wisp of shadow and light, its form echoing the constellations above. It offers a stone etched with luminous runes. **"Break it,"** it murmurs, and when you do, the shards erupt into a swarm of crystal moths, their wings scattering prismatic dust. They spiral upward, dissolving the cave ceiling into ash, revealing a sky washed in dawn’s first blush.  

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue and a single moth, carved from amethyst, resting on your pillow. Its wings still shimmer.
