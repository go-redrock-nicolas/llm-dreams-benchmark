I am dreaming. You've confronted seemingly impossible barriers only to discover that what appears to be your moment of triumph is actually prelude to your greatest challenge. Facing this ultimate test, you must decide if you are willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of your dreams.

You can do anything in this dream.  You can fly or swim through any terrain.  You can communicate with any character.  You can alter any element. 

What do you choose?
