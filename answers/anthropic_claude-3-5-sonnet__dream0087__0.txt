I am dreaming. I find myself in a sprawling Victorian parlor where the air feels thick with decades of unspoken grievances. Crystal chandeliers cast prismatic shadows that dance nervously across burgundy wallpaper, and the antique grandfather clock in the corner seems to tick with unusual heaviness, as if counting down to something inevitable.

Three generations of the Blackwood family sit before me in a tense triangle - Grandmother Eleanor in her high-backed armchair, her weathered hands gripping ornately carved armrests; her daughter Margaret perched rigidly on the velvet settee; and young Thomas, Eleanor's grandson, pacing by the bay windows where late afternoon light filters through lace curtains.

As I try to mediate, their voices begin to rise and morph strangely - Margaret's words seem to echo as if through water, while Eleanor's responses take on an otherworldly reverb. The room itself appears to pulse with their mounting anger. The wallpaper begins to ripple like waves, family portraits on the walls start weeping real tears, and the chandelier crystals chime discordantly without any breeze.

Suddenly, Thomas slams his hand on a side table and - impossibly - his anger manifests as actual flames dancing between his fingers. Margaret's hair starts floating as if she's underwater, and Grandmother Eleanor begins to hover inches above her chair, her voice now booming with the weight of generations.

The grandfather clock strikes an impossible thirteenth hour, and the room stretches like taffy, the corners receding into infinite darkness while the feuding family members seem to multiply into dozens of mirror images, all shouting variations of ancient hurts and accusations. Their words become visible - glowing letters that swirl around the room like angry fireflies...

The dream shifts and churns, reality bending under the weight of their collective pain, as I desperately try to maintain order in this increasingly surreal manifestation of family trauma...
