I am dreaming. I am in a small, black submarine lost within the vast trenches of an ancient and alien ocean world. Pale white bioluminescent creatures float far above, casting shadows onto the veiled ocean fog. A voice from the deep calls out to me, but I cannot understand its words. 

The submarine’s engines shake and groan with effort as I try to descend into the shadowy depths, searching for some unknown truth. The pressure builds, the hull groaning against it, and the ocean’s currents push against the vessel with ferocity. The instruments flicker and fail, the light grows dim, and I am surrounded by total darkness. 

The voice grows louder, calling to me now with a sense of urgency. The ocean transforms into a liquid mirror, impossibly vast and infinite. I see every star, every galaxy, every atom contracted in that mirror, reflecting a million parallel worlds. The voice calls one final time, and as I reach out toward it, the mirror shatters. 

I awake.
