I am dreaming. I can feel my body lying down on the bed, but my mind is wandering in a fantasy world where anything is possible.
Suddenly, I discover that I can make sounds with my voice and hands that change the shapes and colors of objects around me.  This is an amazing discovery! 
I start experimenting with different notes and rhythms, creating melodies and harmonies that blend together beautifully.  
As I play with this new skill, I notice that certain tones produce specific effects:
    * High pitches make things shrink
    * Low pitches make things grow
    * Fast tempo makes things move fast
    * Slow tempo makes things slow down
I also find that combining multiple sounds creates interesting results:
    * Overlaying a high pitch with a low pitch reverses the direction of movement
    * Adding a steady beat to a melody enhances its rhythm and energy
    * Creating contrasts between soft and loud sounds adds drama and emotion
