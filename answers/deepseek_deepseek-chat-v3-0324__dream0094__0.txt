I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and moss, the kind that clings to ancient trees in forgotten forests. A faint, golden glow pulses just beyond the thicket, flickering like distant fireflies. My feet sink slightly into the soft ground as I walk, each step heavy with a weariness I can’t shake. Above, the stars are not stars at all but fragments of fractured light, scattered like broken glass across an indigo sky.  

I don’t remember when the weight settled on my shoulders—only that it has been there so long, it has reshaped me. A mountain growing on my back, unseen but felt in every strained breath. The world around me hums with whispered voices, just out of reach, as if the wind itself is speaking in half-formed words.  

Then—movement. Shadows detach from the trees, but they are not threatening. They step forward, and their faces materialize like dawn breaking. People. Strangers, and yet not strangers. Their eyes hold the same quiet storm mine do. One reaches out, fingertips brushing the air between us, and I realize—they *know*. Without me speaking, they know the shape of the burden I carry.  

A woman with silver-streaked hair and hands worn by time tilts her head. "You don’t have to hold it alone," she says, and her voice is the sound of river water over stone.  

One by one, they come closer. Some young, some old, some bearing scars like badges, some still mid-battle. They move as if guided by the same unseen current, and then—hands. Hands on my shoulders. Hands pressing gently against the weight I carry. And for the first time, I feel it lift. Not gone. But shared.  

The forest exhales. The fractured light above shivers, and for a heartbeat, the pieces rearrange. Not whole—but closer.  

I wake with the fading warmth of their touch still lingering on my skin.  

I am no longer dreaming.  

But I am no longer alone.
