I am dreaming. As you drift into the realm of dreams, you find yourself in an otherworldly chamber, bathed in an ethereal, pulsating glow. The air hums with an ancient energy, making your hair stand on end. In the center of the room, an intricate wooden desk looms before you, its surface covered in yellowed parchment, cryptic symbols dancing across the page.

You extend your hand, fingers brushing against the aged paper. The moment you touch it, the text blurs and shifts, arranging itself into an unknown language with symmetrical patterns. Your eyes strain to make sense of the guttural consonants and flowing vowels, yet your mind struggles to grasp their meaning.

As if a swarm of leaves caught in a sudden gale, the paper sections scatter and distribute across your desk, consumed by an unseen wind. 

Multiple screens appear, stretching across the wall before you. Viscous data pulses across the glass, numbers and charts whirring in a dizzying, kaleidoscopic pattern. You blink rapidly, trying to focus on the graphs and charts. Time has seemingly stopped and the data moves back and forth. A catch in your throat from the dusty air makes you cough.

You're standing closer than you're comfortable with. The screens press against you, the data intensifies, pulsing at a faster rate. It's almost as if you can feel it physically pushing against your skin as you stand too close to the screens. Feeling the pressure change as you move, you take an uneasy step back.

The screens and parchment pulsate once more, this time in unison, becoming one pulsating mass before you. It draws closer, merging together into a tangible, roiling mass of light and data. It chalks on the insides of your eyelids, as if trying to bore into your brain.

You struggle to maintain your focus on both the foreign language and the relentless onslaught of information. A growing sense of dread creeps over you as the data shifts faster and faster, leaving patches of your brain numb. The foreign language has morphed into a buzzing, any readable meaning long gone.

The room is starting to contour around you, instinctively wanting to browse. Cold sweat has formed on your brow, you feel the mechanism of your inside self turning up, ready to flee.

Your mind screams for relief from the sensory overload, but the dream holds fast, determined to push you to your limits. With a final, desperate gasp, you wake with a start, your heart pounding in your chest as you realize it was all just a vivid, terrifying dream.
