I am dreaming. It starts with fading lights, and your soul is naked. You feel that feeling you get before a launch into orbit, where everything is crisp, and the silence is an ocean. This dream is soft with the weight of significance, and for a moment, you’re acutely aware of how deeply everything you think matters. You inhale and smile, realizing that tonight, the stars have changed their arrangement just for you.

The dream grows richer with detail. You’re standing in a grand hall, filled with the muted hum of silence. The air is heavier here, weighted with secrets waiting to be discovered. Skyscraper-tall bookshelves line the walls, filled with volumes bound not in leather or cloth but in the soft glow of dusky colors you’ve never seen before. Each book is warm, alive, waiting for a touch. The shelves reach so high that there are floating walkways above you, populated by curious creatures that whisper, gesturing towards certain volumes.

You walk forward. The marble floor beneath you resonates with every step, echoing your heartbeat in counterpoint. The gossamer curtains that descend from above undulate softly, like waves breaking on a shore of golden sand. As you move, the colors around you change with each breath you take, bleeding into one another like watercolors across a page.

You come to a grand staircase, stretching upward into a cascade of faint light. Your feet don’t touch the steps as you ascend. The light shivers and trembles, not from any breeze, but from a kind of emotional resonance. It’s not just light—it’s a spectrum of feeling playing across your skin, each step up this staircase awakening memories you didn’t even know were asleep.

At the top, the air shifts. The hum that once filled the hall is gone, replaced by the haunting sound of music—ghostly yet familiar, haunting yet beautiful. It is so personal, so intimate, you think it must be your soul singing without your consent. Ahead, there’s a door crafted of a single piece of some exquisite, unearthly wood. None of its edges are perfectly formed; it’s as if it were grown rather than built. Faint words seem to shimmer on its surface, but no matter how you try, they remain just out of reach.

You reach for the door, and it falls open without a sound. Inside, it’s like stepping into another universe, one that expands infinitely in every direction. The floor is no longer solid, it’s more like a flowing current of light, swaying beneath you. The ceiling is alive, pulsing with stars, nebulas, and galaxies that swirl according to how you tilt your gaze.

You move forward, and as you do, the voices of every person you’ve ever known come alive in your ears, each one delivering a message that feels oddly wrong. Not hurtful, just… off. And you realize that your dreams have been whispering half-truths. The mirror you’ve been gazing into your entire life has distorted your reflection. Not intentionally, but not without consequence.

You make a decision, a silent vow in your dream: you will no longer let those half-truths shape your waking self. As you breathe out, every piece of you that was clinging to those old beliefs—beliefs about your worth, your strength, your potential—starts to shatter like glass. And with each fragment, you grow lighter, brighter, as if you’re peering through a lens that’s finally been wiped clean.

The light from the stars pulses, and the dream closes around you. You see all your walls collapsing, every defense and facade melting into the endless expanse of light around you. The whispers grow softer, but now, they tell you the truth in a way you’ve never heard it before.

A choice has been made. A shift is taking place. You’re releasing those beliefs, those outdated parts of yourself, and you feel a profound peace. For the first time in a long time, or perhaps for the first time ever, you are exactly who you’re meant to be.

In the brightest moment, you feel it—a weight, as if the very universe is shifting in your favor. And just like that, you wake with a smile on your face, feeling the muted echoes of what you just experienced still reverberating in your bones.
