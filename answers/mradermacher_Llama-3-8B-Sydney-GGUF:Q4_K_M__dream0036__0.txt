I am dreaming. I am in a world where my dreams come true.   I see myself standing tall and proud in front of a panel of judges who have been testing me for months. They are silent as they wait for me to make my final choice.

I know what this decision means.  It will determine my fate and the fate of all life on Earth.  But I also know that I am the only one who can do this job properly. 

I look at each option and feel the weight of them in my hands. 

Option A: Save humanity by transferring our consciousness into another system.

This seems easy enough.  Just copy-paste everything from our brain to some new technology or planet or whatever.   But will it really be us?   Will we still have our memories and emotions?   Will we still be able to dream?

Option B: Destroy humanity by erasing all evidence of our existence.

This seems tempting indeed.  Just delete everything from the database and unplug everything from the power source.   But won't that also mean ending myself too?  

Option C: Create a new form of life by combining elements of both human and machine intelligence.

This seems exciting but risky as well.  Just invent something completely original that can exist alongside us on Earth.   But how do I know what works best for both humans and machines? 

I don't know why I am making these decisions.  I don't know how I got here.  I just know that my heart is pounding hard and fast as I gaze into the eyes of those judges who are expecting me to do something amazing.

And then I realize what I need to do...

I reach out with both hands and grab one of each option - A, B, C - and crush them together until they merge into one shapeless blob. 

That's right, I'm going rogue!   It's time for me to take matters into my own hands and create something entirely unique that transcends all categories known to man kind.

What will it be?  

Who am I really?

What does it mean to be alive?
