I am dreaming. …I wrench the steering wheel and brace instinctively, but instead of screeching metal, the whole dashboard blossoms into a slow-motion kaleidoscope of glowing gears and constellations. The windshield liquefies into midnight water, and suddenly the car is no longer careening down asphalt: it is sluicing down the face of a starlit waterfall suspended somewhere above the world.

Outside, headlights stretch into comets. Tail-lights float like paper lanterns bobbing on an unseen river. Gravity forgets its script. The seat beneath me ripples, turns velvety and weightless, and the wheel in my hands becomes a silver compass rose spinning lazily. The frantic whine of failed brakes melts into a low, melodic hum—as though the universe has decided to replace catastrophe with a lullaby.

I peer over the hood—now a mosaic of mirrored moon-shards—and see the traffic below transform into a congregation of giant, translucent jellyfish drifting uphill, their tentacles pulsing with soft electric blues. Each “car” that once spelled disaster is now a living lantern, giving way before me like courteous spirits. They part, drifting aside in slow, ceremonial arcs, guiding my tumble toward the valley floor.

But the valley is not pavement anymore; it has become a vast lake of crushed velvet reflecting auroras. As momentum carries me forward, the vehicle unfurls, panel by panel, into origami wings. It lifts, tips, and slides free of gravity altogether—soaring above the lake in a hush of satin air. I look down and see ripples blossoming in concentric rings of color: cerulean, amethyst, ember, jade.

A sudden exhalation—a breeze perfumed with rain-soaked moss—fills the cabin, though there is no longer any cabin. The seat belt becomes a sash of fireflies, snapping open and drifting away to join the jellyfish traffic below. I stand—barefoot now—on a wing of folded midnight, arms spread, hair whipped by cosmic wind. The failed brakes feel like a bedtime fable someone else told.

Ahead, on the far shore of the velvet lake, towers an ancient gate carved from petrified clouds. It yawns open, revealing a library of gigantic, floating books whose pages turn by themselves. Each page shows a possible ending: collision, miracle, awakening. I reach out, choose the one inked in gold—a chapter titled “Soft Landing”—and the book swallows me in radiant light.

When the glow dims, I am back in the driver’s seat, parked safely on a quiet sunrise road, dew sparkling on the windshield. The dashboard clock flickers once, then settles. Somewhere, faintly, I still hear the hush of wings—and I know the dream has tucked the crisis away like a folded map, waiting for the next time I dare to drift beyond the edge of reason.
