I am dreaming. You blink once—and suddenly the wooden desk beneath your hands dissolves into rippling mercury. Floating before you, each exam question appears as a delicate, luminescent origami crane, gently beating its paper wings in the hush of the hall. Their folded bodies are inscribed with swirling calligraphy that glows in hues of amethyst and jade. As you lean closer, the soft patter of their wings echoes like distant applause.

The first crane drifts toward your mouth and unfolds itself, revealing a question that swims across the mirror-smooth surface of your tongue: “Define the shape of a dream when every color you know has fallen asleep.” You feel its words seep into your mind—cool and tingling—long before you even draw your pen. Across the aisle, your classmates have transformed into marble statues, frozen mid-stride, their eyes unopened yet somehow reflecting your own racing heartbeat.

You lift your pen, and it’s no ordinary writing tool but a slender feather plucked from a phoenix’s tail. With each stroke, leaves of golden ink sprout from the page and drift skyward, unspooling your thoughts in streamer-thin ribbons of light. The second question coils itself around your wrist like a silken serpent: “Explain the architecture of hope as if it were a city built only at dawn.” A hush falls, broken only by the distant rumble of thunder—or is it the scratch of quills on floating notebooks?

As you answer, the exam hall tilts—and suddenly you’re standing on a glistening shore where waves lap in slow motion, spelling out the final prompt in foaming letters: “What will you become when all your answers take flight?” The horizon burns with the first blush of sunrise, and you realize that this test is both an ending and a beginning, written in the language of your deepest dreams. Just as you press your last word to the shore, the dawn’s light washes over you—and you know, in that golden glow, that the career you’ll choose was born here, in this surreal, shimmering moment between sleep and wakefulness.
