I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the steps of a grand, stone building. I feel cool, damp air on my face and a sense of odd curiosity as I step through the massive front doors and gaze up at a ceiling that stretches high and high, until it disappears in the flickering glow of intricately carved lamps.

Officially selected to lead this prestigious institution in my dream, I soon become engulfed in skepticism. People I pass say things aloud and to themselves, questioning how I could possibly be qualified. It all sorts of feels strange and surreal, with reality and my dream state intermingling and twisting.
