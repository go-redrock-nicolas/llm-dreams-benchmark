I am dreaming. In the gossamer space between consciousness and oblivion, I find myself walking along a crystalline shoreline where the sand shifts between azure and silver with each step. The sky above isn't simply blue—it's a tapestry of colors that have no names in waking life, swirling and pulsing with emotions rather than light. I can taste the air, and it tastes like childhood memories and possibilities not yet born.

As I walk, my footprints behind me sprout miniature forests—tiny trees with leaves made of whispered secrets that tinkle like wind chimes when the dream-breeze touches them.
