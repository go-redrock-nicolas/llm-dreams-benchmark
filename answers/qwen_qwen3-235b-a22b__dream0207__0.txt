I am dreaming. A vast plain swirls beneath me, glowing with the pulse of twilight, where stars drip slowly like honey over the edges of the sky. The horizon ripples, not from wind, but from the shifting resonance of something unheard—an unseen song that trembles through the air like a subterranean memory. I am standing between two great gatherings: on one side, the Soryn, beings of shimmer and vibration, their translucent forms refracting the dreamscape into kaleidoscopic shapes as they weave conversations through bursts of radiant brilliance. On the other, the Grolvani, hulking, wise creatures with long, hollow bones that they strike like flutes, using the tones to sing in a dense, bass-laden tongue that vibrates through my teeth and into my marrow.

They are trying to speak to one another. Again and again, the Soryn launch constellations of color into the air—sapphire greetings, emerald questions, bursts of vermillion emotion. And again and again, the Grolvani respond with thunderous low tones and aching melodies that seem to Alice with sorrow and confusion.

They don’t understand. Not a word. Not a hue.

Above us all rises the Dream-Moon, a silver sphere that pulses like a heart, tethered by golden threads to something unseen above. I’m told that if harmony is not achieved before it slips beneath the horizon—drowned by night—something ancient will awaken beneath the dream-tectonics and unravel the balance between worlds.

I close my eyes.

Inside, I feel both languages cradled near my soul, fighting to be born in tandem. Words are not enough. Light is not enough. Sound is not enough. I must become both the prism and the drum.

I step into the center, between the blinding flickers and mournful tones, and I begin to sing with my hands.

As I raise my arms, I shape pulses of color with my voice, a hum set at the frequency of both light and vibration. Colors span outward like cathedral glass suspended in air—each tone given presence, each light given pitch. I form luminous chords, sculpting music into vision. I scream softness and whisper in violet. I am a vessel and a conduit.

The Soryn pause, their patterns slowing, eyes like galaxies flaring open. The Grolvani lower their great boneflutes, their eyes catching the iridescent haze I've built between us. Then the largest Soryn, its body outlined in the golden arc of solar fire, emits a slow cascade of rainbows that pulse in rhythm with one of the Grolvani’s mourning notes.

A match. Tentative and soft, but a connection.

And it spreads.

More of the Soryn respond with patterns timed to the undulating tones of the Grolvani. I dance between them, a maestro of the impossible, weaving a symphony of language not yet named, a tapestry of sound and shimmer braided together in real time. The harmonics grow sweeter, the light more gentle. Something vast and ancient beneath the dream earth takes a slow, relaxing breath.

I hear a murmur—in no tongue but in understanding alone. And one by one, the entities kneel, not in submission, but in awe of a harmony they thought could never be.

Above us, the Dream-Moon glows brighter for a single moment, and then begins to sink—not in defeat, but in fulfillment.

As the dream fades, I feel a small ember within me—left behind where the languages met. A seedling of union. A cross-wired bloom of sound and light.

And deep in my chest, one thought remains glowing softly like embers:

Some harmonies are too large a single world to contain.
