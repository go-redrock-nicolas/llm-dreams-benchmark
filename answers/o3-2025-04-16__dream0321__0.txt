I am dreaming. …inhale the shimmering hush of night air and step across the threshold of sleep, where the world rearranges itself like liquid glass. A low hum—part heartbeat, part thunder—ripples through the darkness. Soft pulses of cerulean light bloom, and a rough-hewn obsidian door materializes before you, carved with sigils that flicker like live embers. In crimson script across the lintel appears the invitation:

ENTER THE SKY-SHEAR RUN  
    An experience beyond velocity.  
    Danger unavoidable.  
    Courage optional—but recommended.

Your pulse becomes a war drum. Fingers tremble, yet you push the door. It dissolves into stardust, and suddenly you’re standing on the rim of a colossal canyon that splits the clouds themselves. Walls of amethyst rock plunge into fog a thousand meters below. Suspended on spindly iron cables are narrow catwalks and spiral slides, twisting like metallic vines through a storm of electricity. A wind scented with ozone lashes your cheeks; every gust booms against the cliffs, a choir of titans urging you forward.

To your left stands a guide: a tall woman with silver goggles and a jacket stitched from patches of aurora-light. Her voice crackles like radio static smoothed by velvet.

“Welcome, Dreamer. The Sky-Shear Run has three stages. Survive them, you keep the memory forever. Fail, and the canyon keeps you instead. Ready?”

Nerves quiver; excitement floods in behind them, a roaring tide. You nod.

STAGE ONE: THE STEP INTO NOTHING  
She clips a luminescent harness around your torso, gestures to a cable that stretches into clouded oblivion. The rules are simple: leap, swing, land on the opposite platform, no braking allowed. You breathe once, twice, and jump. Wind slams into you like a living creature—icy claws raking hair and skin. Your stomach somersaults as the cable bows. A comet-tail of sparks showers the canyon while your speed multiplies, decimals erased by raw acceleration. Fog parts under your momentum; for one weightless heartbeat you see open galaxy above and a roaring purple river far below. A howl of mingled terror and exhilaration rips free of your throat. Then the landing platform surges up—steel grates, lightning-lit—and you smash onto it, knees buckling, elation blooming like wildfire.

STAGE TWO: THE GLASS CYCLONE  
The guide waves you onward through a shimmering curtain of mist that tastes faintly of peppermint and static electricity. You emerge inside a transparent vortex: cylindrical walls of tempered crystal whirl around a hollow core. Inside, dozens of narrow beams revolve at different heights, irregularly, like clock hands gone mad. The object: cross to the opposite hatch without being struck. Fail, and you’re flung into the storm outside. Your heartbeat becomes a metronome; sweat beads at your brow as you time the spins. Leap—duck—roll—pause. A beam skims your back, humming like an angry cello string. Another slashes overhead, scattering shards of cold neon. Your breaths sharpen to knives. Finally you dive forward, somersaulting through the open hatch as the vortex shrieks behind you, triumphant but denied.

STAGE THREE: THE STORM-RIDING DROP  
A final ladder leads upward into blackness. At the top, a circular launch pad floats, anchored only by thick chains. Above, the sky churns with a supercell of emerald and violet lightning; below yawns the canyon’s deepest pit. The guide tosses you a wingsuit woven from star-motes that flicker between colors you’ve never named. “Ride the heart of the storm,” she says, “and let it choose how you land.” Thunder snarls in answer.

You hesitate—every survival instinct screaming revolt—but fascination eclipses fear. You step to the lip, arms spread. Lightning forks, kissing the edges of your suit with incandescent fingers. The storm’s electric roar threads itself through your bones. Then… you fall.

Air ceases to be air; it becomes a river of pure sound and radiant pressure. The wingsuit inflates, sculpting currents. You are both fragile and invincible, a seed on the gale, a god in free­fall. Columns of charged wind catch you in abrupt upward jolts; your stomach cartwheels into your throat, then weightlessness floods you again. Your laugh tears free—wild, defiant, alive. Rain the size of pearls peppers your goggles, each droplet shattering into micro-constellations around you.

The canyon floor zooms up, yet you sense rather than see an exit: a ribbon of midnight water that snakes through a cavern mouth. Instinct ignites. You angle left, tipping one wing into a downdraft, slicing inches above jagged spires. A bolt of lavender lightning erupts off the rock, and for a single, breath-stopping instant you and the plasma share the same air, the same ferocity.

Last second: you pull hard. The wingsuit flares; velocity transforms into lift. You sail through the cavern mouth—and everything goes silent.

The cave opens into a luminous grotto, walls slick with phosphorescent quartz. You coast onto a cushion of drifting embers that dissolve before touch. Landing, you unclip, knees trembling, lungs on fire, grin unstoppable. The guide is already there, impossibly. She applauds, slow and thunderous.

“Adventure accepted. Memory earned.”

She taps your forehead with one gloved finger, and the grotto’s light pours inward, crystallizing as a tiny, perfect shard behind your eyes—etched forever into the library of dreams.

A spiral staircase of moonbeams appears, and you climb. Each step dissolves after you tread it, until at last your pillow materializes beneath your head. Dawn’s first light brushes the curtains. Your heart still races; muscles quiver with phantom wind. For a moment the scent of ozone lingers, proof that the canyon existed, that you dared, that the Sky-Shear Run—danger and thrill entwined—has stitched itself into your very breathing.

You smile into the morning hush, equal parts relief and craving… because some night, when the stars align and the hum rises again, you know the invitation will reappear, glowing scarlet across the darkness:

ENTER ROUND TWO.
