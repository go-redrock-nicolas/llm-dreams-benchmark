I am dreaming. nd you decide to explore what it would be like if you did feel those emotions after all.

As your dream shifts into a darker and more sinister direction, the shadowy figure of yourself becomes more menacing and powerful. You realize that this is who you truly are: A monster without empathy or compassion. This realization terrifies you because it means there's no hope for redemption or salvation from your inner darkness.

Then, suddenly, a bright light appears in front of you. It's so intense and dazzling that it hurts your eyes at first glance. As the pain subsides and your vision adjusts to the glare, you notice that the light is emanating from an angelic figure standing before you.

The angel speaks with a voice that resonates deep within your soul. It tells you that it has been sent by God to offer you a chance at redemption and salvation from your inner darkness. All you have to do is accept its offer and follow its lead out of the dream world and into reality.

You hesitate at first because accepting means leaving behind all memories of this dream and what it revealed about yourself, but then remember that forgetting would be like dying without ever having lived. So, with courage and determination, you accept the angel's offer and follow its lead out of the dream world and into reality where you wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.
