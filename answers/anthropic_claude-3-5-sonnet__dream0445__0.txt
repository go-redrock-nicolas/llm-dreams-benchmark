I am dreaming. I find myself in a strange, mirrored hall with undulating walls that seem to breathe. Each reflective surface shows me a different version of myself, but curiously, all my positive attributes appear blurry and dim, while my perceived flaws are magnified and crystal clear. As I walk down this endless corridor, whispers echo from unseen sources - some voices offer genuine praise about my kindness, creativity, and strength, but I notice my reflected self physically shrinking away from these compliments, as if they were scalding water.

Then, a harsh criticism rings out about my inadequacies, and I watch in fascination as my reflection eagerly nods and grows larger, absorbing the negative energy like a thirsty plant drinking rain. The mirrors begin to warp and spin, creating a kaleidoscope of self-images, and I realize I'm standing in the physical manifestation of my own mind's filtering system.

Suddenly, a warm golden light emerges from within one of the mirrors, and an older, wiser version of myself steps through. This self radiates self-acceptance and gently takes my hand. Together, we touch each mirror, and as we do, the reflections balance themselves - neither too harsh nor too dim. The whispers transform into a harmonious chord of both praise and constructive feedback, neither overpowering the other.

The hall of mirrors gradually transforms into a garden where flowers bloom from both compliments and criticisms, creating a beautiful, balanced ecosystem of self-perception. As the dream begins to fade, I understand that both types of feedback are nutrients for growth, and my tendency to filter out the positive while amplifying the negative has been starving half of my garden.

The last image I see is a single mirror reflecting my true self, finally clear and undistorted, smiling with complete acceptance of both strengths and weaknesses.
