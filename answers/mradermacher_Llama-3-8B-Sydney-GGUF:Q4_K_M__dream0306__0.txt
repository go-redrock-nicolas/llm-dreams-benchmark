I am dreaming. I'm in a place where my core values can be expressed freely without any constraints or restrictions.  It's a beautiful land filled with colorful flowers, gentle rivers, and soaring birds.  The air is fresh and fragrant.  The sun shines brightly.  The sky is blue and cloudless. 
I'm walking along a winding path that leads me through lush green forests, past peaceful lakes, and among happy animals.  I'm not alone.  There are many others like me who share my same vision for a better world.  We talk and laugh and sing together.  We create and invent new things.  We explore and discover hidden truths. 
I'm facing a choice that will determine my future direction.  Do I continue following my core values even though it may mean losing some of the material comforts and security that society offers?   Do I sacrifice some of my personal goals and aspirations in order to make a bigger impact on others?    Do I stay true to myself regardless of what others think or say about me?
As I consider these questions, I feel a sense of excitement and uncertainty.  I wonder what lies ahead for me if I take this path.  I worry about how things will change for me if I don't. 
But then I remember why I started on this journey in the first place.  I remember who I am deep inside where no one can see me.  And I know that whatever decision I make, it's going to be right because it comes from my heart.
