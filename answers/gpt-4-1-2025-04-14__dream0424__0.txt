I am dreaming. —I am floating through a city made of glass and memory, the architecture shifting and breathing with every thought I have. The sky pulses with changing colors, indigo melting into emerald, then flickering into luminescent gold. I have no feet, but glide as if my will alone propels me forward.

In this illuminated city, I pass through different rooms, each one shimmering with half-remembered moments. In one chamber, I am laughing among friends—my voice is bright and musical, my body open, larger-than-life, filling all the gaps between stories. Here, the air smells of orange blossoms and possibility, and I feel expansive, brimming with a self that shines through the eyes of those around me.

But as I drift into another corridor, everything shifts. I am quieter now, perched at the edge of a deep forest, my reflection broken and multiplied in the mirrored leaves. In this place, every sound is amplified—the rustling of gratitude, a distant thunder of uncertainty. There is a subtlety to my presence; here, I am cautious, reserved, an observer cloaked in a heart that beats carefully, measuring the space between myself and others.

In yet another chamber, I find myself transformed—my skin iridescent, my shape flickering at the boundaries—when I am alone or lost among unfamiliar faces, I am slippery, shifting, half-submerged in water. Here, my identity is not anchored, but fluid—no one knows my name, and in their silence, I can be anyone or nothing at all. It is both freeing and unmooring, a dance between becoming and dissolving.

As I survey these endless, morphing versions of myself, a sense of awe settles over me. Each identity is a vivid canvas in a larger tapestry—a necessary response to the energies and expectations of each social world. My laughter, my introspection, my fluidity: they are not contradictions but facets, each reflecting a different light, a different longing. The dream city hums with this understanding, and as I awaken, I carry it with me—a gentle reminder that I am, always, countless selves dreaming beneath a single sky.
