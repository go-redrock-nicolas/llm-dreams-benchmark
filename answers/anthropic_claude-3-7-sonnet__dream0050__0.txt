I am dreaming. The invitation comes as a weathered parchment folded into an impossible origami shape that unfolds itself in my palms. The ink shimmers, changing color with the angle of light—emerald to sapphire to amethyst—as if written with crushed gemstones suspended in morning dew.

I follow the map to an ancient lighthouse perched on cliff edges that shouldn't logically support its weight. The spiral staircase inside winds both up and down simultaneously, defying spatial logic. With each step, photographs line the walls—moving images of people laughing, arguing, embracing—members of this collective I'm about to join.

The meeting room reveals itself as a circular chamber where the ceiling is a living kaleidoscope of bioluminescent creatures. Seven people sit around a table made from a single slab of wood that appears to be still growing, small buds forming along its edges. They turn to me with expressions of recognition, though we've never met.

Each person wears a token—a brass key, a feather brooch, a ring of smoke that circles one woman's wrist. They speak in a layered language where words carry multiple meanings simultaneously. Their conversations flow with the practiced rhythm of people who can finish each other's thoughts, shorthand references to shared adventures punctuating their speech.

When they laugh, the room's light pulses in response. When they argue, plants growing from crevices in the wall tilt toward the speaker with the strongest point. The oldest member—a woman with eyes like tidal pools—extends her hand to me. On her palm rests a small object that is mine, though I've never seen it before.

I reach for it, understanding that accepting this token means diving into their world completely.
