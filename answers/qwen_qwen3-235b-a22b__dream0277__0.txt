I am dreaming. The air is thick with silence—oppressive, as though sound itself is afraid to betray what lies ahead. I find myself standing at the edge of an endless corridor. The walls are made not of stone or plaster, but of crumbling memories—flickering images, half-formed voices, the faint echo of a childhood lullaby suspended like smoke in the air. I want to turn back, but some instinct, deeper than fear, holds me still.

There is something down this corridor. It has been waiting for me for a long time.

I begin walking. Each step is drawn forward not by curiosity but by a strange gravity—an invisible pull that coils tighter around my chest with each advance. The corridor stretches endlessly, but time seems to warp here. Ages pass, epochs collapse, and still I walk. Shadows cling to the edges of my vision like forgotten regrets. I feel the weight of every lie I have ever told, every truth I have avoided. The walls begin to close in.

Suddenly, a door appears. It is tall and dark, taller than any door should be, fashioned from black stone flecked with veins of glowing silver. It pulses faintly, like a heart that still remembers the beat of a forgotten life. I know whatever is on the other side is the reason I came. I feel its gaze before I see its shape—a presence that unsettles the air like a thunderstorm ready to break.

I press my hand to the cool surface. My breath hitches. I know what I fear most is not the truth, but the cost of seeing it.

With a final push, the door creaks open.

Inside, the room is filled with mirrors. But not ordinary ones—in these, I see not reflections, but a thousand versions of myself. Each mirror shows a life I could have lived. One self is crowned in flames, another kneeling in the rain. A version of me is smiling, cradling a child they never abandoned. Another walks away from a love they once chose. In the mirror at the center, I watch myself standing here, frozen—my hands shaking, tears carving silent rivers down my face.

A voice speaks, soft but absolute.

“Why do you turn away from yourself?”

It isn't a judgment. It's an invitation. The kind that dares you not to look away.

I step forward. Each mirror fractures as I pass. Shards cut through time, through image, through the lies I've allowed to define me. With each shattered piece, I feel lighter, as if my bones are remembering what it is to be real. The air is no longer heavy—it breathes with me now, alive and electric. The corridor is gone. There is only sky above me now, the deep, unfathomable blue of twilight melting into dusk.

And in that sky, a constellation forms—not of stars, but memories pulled together into new shape. I watch as my life is rewritten not in sorrow or avoidance, but in acceptance.

And then—everything softens.

I wake. Not gasping, not startled awake with a scream—but slowly unraveled into reality. The weight is gone. There is a ringing silence in my chest.

I know now.

We are often afraid not of what lies ahead, but of what we've refused to hold behind. In the dreams where we dare not glance, there waits a terrible kind of beauty. A reckoning. A rebirth. And sometimes, just sometimes, the way out is through.
