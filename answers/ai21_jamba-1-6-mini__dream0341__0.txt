I am dreaming. You feel an overwhelming sense of responsibility for someone else's well-being during a crisis. Carrying this emotional burden, you find yourself in a world unlike any other. Picture this:

You are standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering ocean. The sky is an otherworldly blend of hues—shades of violet, indigo, and deep sapphire. The horizon is alive with the lapping waves, not of water, but of soft, glowing light. Each wave crests and falls in sync with the beating of your heart, as if it carries the rhythm of existence itself.

Far ahead, there is a luminous city made of crystal and glass. It rises from the ocean like a mirage, its spires reaching not for the sky, but for the stars themselves. The light of the city pulses and hums, a song of creation that you can almost hear beneath the crash of the luminous waves.

The air is charged with energy. It is thick and warm, tasting of sweet jasmine and the salt of the sea. The very breath you take is a wonder, every inhale like a sip of liquid light, every exhale a gift to the universe.

As you move forward, the ground beneath your feet shifts. What looks like sand is actually tiny, glowing crystals. Each step sends out ripples of light, creating paths that disappear behind you like whispers in the wind.

Suddenly, a creature unlike anything you’ve ever seen emerges from the ocean. It is a mermaid, but her form is not of flesh and bone. She is made of light—a cascade of shimmering particles that ripple and dance like a mirage. Her voice is a hauntingly beautiful melody, a soft hum that wraps around you, comforting and ancient.

“Why have you come?” she asks, her voice a symphony that resonates in your very soul.

“I… I’ misefalme iestraeth,” you stammer, overwhelmed by the beauty and the weight of her presence. “I came because… because I must.”

The mermaid smiles, her light reflecting off the swirling waves. “You are the chosen one,” she whispers. “You carry the burden of the world, and it is your destiny to heal it. But remember, you do not walk this path alone. For every moment you face, another stands beside you, unseen but there.”

The ocean begins to churn, and the sky darkens. The glowing sands beneath your feet start to sink, as if the world itself is unraveling.

“Go now,” she says. “Go with the knowledge that you are never truly alone. Every step you take, you are guided by the light.”

With each step, you feel the weight on your shoulders lighten ever so slightly. The light of your surroundings grows brighter as if the world around you is waking from a dream. You realize, as the dream fades, that you are not just the one carrying the world's burden—you are the world.

Every wave, every glowing crystal, every beating heart is a part of you. And you, now realizing your true power, awaken.
