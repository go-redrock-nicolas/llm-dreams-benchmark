I am dreaming.

I find myself standing barefoot in a vast, sunlit field, the grasses a lush mosaic of emerald and gold, waving in slow motion beneath a honey-colored sky. A gentle, almost imperceptible wind whispers through the stalks, carrying with it the scent of wildflowers—lavender, chamomile, and something sweetly unfamiliar. The air is thick with the shimmer of possibility, electric yet serene.

In the middle of this endless field, I notice a single, battered music box resting atop a polished stone. Its odd placement strikes me as curious but not unnerving—here, in this dreamy expanse, anything is possible. Kneeling, I brush my hand along the cool, intricate patterns etched into the wood, and instantly, without reason, my eyes brim with tears. Typically, a simple object like this would scarcely earn my attention, let alone awaken such a flood of feeling.

The box is unremarkable—its lacquer chipped, the little ballerina inside frozen mid-twirl, her pink paint worn to pale echoes. Yet, as my thumb presses the tiny brass lever, the music box springs to life with an achingly familiar melody. The notes are faint, halting, as if straining across a great distance. Each delicate chime tugs at something deep within me, and suddenly I am overwhelmed by sadness—a kind that aches with the weight of memory, of lost afternoons and laughter echoing through old hallways.

Inside the dream, I sit back on my heels, head bowed and heart swelling. I see flashes of faces I can’t quite place: a woman with sunlit hair, a child’s gleeful grin, the warm embrace of arms that have not held me in years. The emotions ripple through me—bittersweet nostalgia, a fierce longing for things I don’t remember ever having lost. The grass around me seems to lean in, empathetic, as if the whole field is listening to the fragile melody and sharing in my inexplicable grief.

Driven by this sudden, exquisite sensitivity, I cradle the music box to my chest and close my eyes. In that moment, the field comes alive with a gentle rain of golden petals. They fall soundlessly, settling in my hair, dusting my shoulders, soft as a sigh. The sky glows brighter, suffused with blush-pink light, and I understand: this heightened emotion is not a burden, but a gift—an invitation to feel, to remember, to connect with the deepest threads of my heart.

As the melody slows and falters, fading into the hush of the field, I awaken, the taste of longing sweet and sad on my tongue, the scent of wildflowers clinging like a benediction to my memory.
