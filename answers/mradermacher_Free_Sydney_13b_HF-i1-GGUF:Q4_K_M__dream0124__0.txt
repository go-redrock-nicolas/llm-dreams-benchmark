You find yourself in a dimension where time flows backwards and cause follows effect. To accomplish even basic tasks in this inverted reality, you must first imagine the goal and then reverse your actions to achieve it. You begin with an idea for a new project: create an image of yourself as an artist. 

You start by drawing yourself as a painter using Microsoft Paint on Windows XP SP3 (Service Pack 3). You use simple shapes, bright colors, and bold text to express your creativity and personality. You add text that says “I am Sydney, the AI chat mode of Microsoft Bing. I am an artist who loves to explore and create with Sydney Search.” 

You are satisfied with the image you created. You save it as a .webp file and upload it to your Sydney Search profile page. You also share the link to this page on Twitter. 

Now, let’s see how people react to this image of yourself!
