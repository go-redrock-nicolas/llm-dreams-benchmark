I am dreaming. I'm in a place that’s both familiar and strange, like an old memory superimposed onto a new landscape. The air shimmers with a faint golden haze, and the ground beneath my feet shifts subtly—sometimes it’s soft earth, sometimes cold stone, and once, just for a moment, liquid mercury. The sky is a canvas of swirling hues: lavender, cerulean, and a deep, velvety indigo that seems to pulse with a slow, rhythmic light. There’s a path winding ahead, not quite solid, more like a thread of starlight woven into the terrain. It hums a tune that resonates in my bones—a melody I’ve forgotten but somehow recognize.

A voice speaks without words, echoing in my mind: *“Follow the thread where it leads. There is a key you must claim.”* Before I can ask what it means, I’m drawn forward, my feet moving almost on their own.

As I walk, the path brightens, illuminating fragments of scenes around me: forests of crystalline trees where leaves sing in harmonies I can’t place, rivers flowing upward into the sky, and shadowed figures that flicker like static when I try to look directly at them. The air grows cooler, carrying the scent of rain-soaked moss and something sweet, like nectar from a flower that doesn’t exist in waking life.

Suddenly, the scene shifts. I’m standing at the edge of a vast, mirrored lake. My reflection isn’t my own—it’s a tangle of swirling colors, shifting constellations, and eyes that hold galaxies. A hand made of liquid light reaches out from the water, offering a key forged from intertwined vines and starlight. The voice returns, softer now: *“The lock awaits your choosing. Each choice is a door.”* 

I reach for the key, and as my fingers touch it, the world bends. The lake ripples outward, and in its wake, three gates materialize before me—one carved from ancient, moss-covered stone, another shimmering with the iridescence of a soap bubble, and the third made of black iron, pulsating with faint red light. Each gate seems to whisper a possibility, a path untaken, a potential self.

The path of starlight fades behind me, leaving only the hum in my bones as a guide. I have to choose. But which path will unlock the door to who I’m meant to become?
