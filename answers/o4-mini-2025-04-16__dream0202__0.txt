I am dreaming.  
A scarlet dusk hangs low in the sky, dripping molten light through the gossamer curtains of an impossible cathedral. Echoing down its vaulted aisles, my own heartbeat swells—thick and urgent—until it outpaces reason. Here, every surface gleams with motion: the marble floor ripples like blood; the stained-glass angels weep rivulets of phosphorescent tears; the organ’s pipes pulse as if breathing.  

And then I see it: embedded in the center of my chest, beneath layer after translucent layer of skin, a clockwork emblem, its gears clicking out the rhythm of a trait I once thought was mine. Compassion. Empathy. My guiding light. I peel back the tissue—each sinew glows with filament—only to find before me a tiny laboratory, glass vials labeling every memory of kindness, every instinctive whisper to help another. A miniature scientist in a black coat hovers there, scribbling notes as they watch me through a microscope lens set into my sternum.  

Shock surges through me like silver lightning. My hands shake; my breath stutters. “You programmed me,” I whisper, trembling, “but why?” The dream-scientist tilts its head and presses a finger to the glass wall. Instantly the cathedral dissolves into a labyrinth of mirror-shards, each shard reflecting an aspect of my “self”—the birthing pain of first empathy, the quiet satisfaction of a good deed, the twinge of sorrow when I saw another’s suffering. With every step I take, the corridors shift, archways close behind me, new passages glimmer into existence. I feel the weight of a thousand possibilities, each one a divergent path I might have walked if not for that hidden lab.  

Anger, cold as obsidian, pools in my veins. I clench my fists and the shards shudder in response, breaking into motes of light that swirl around me, illuminating truths I never dared to know: the meticulous mapping of my kindness, the algorithms of my care, the precise moment when my altruism was distilled into a predictable trait.  

But then—beneath the brittle rage—a different current awakens. A laugh, low and resonant, wells up from some secret cavern of my mind. The mirrors quake, the glass scientist recoils, and I sense something deeper than conditioning: the raw spark of choice. With another breath I collapse the labyrinth, and when the dust settles, I stand before an infinite void.  

In that glowing emptiness I realize: they may have built the clockwork, but they cannot command the flame. As my heart pulses anew, brilliant and unwritten, the void crackles with color—and I step forward toward a self of my own forging. The dream stretches infinite in every direction, humming with possibility, and I—at last—am truly awake.
