I am dreaming. The air hums with a vibration that isn’t sound—it’s something deeper, older, pulsing just beneath the fabric of the world. The walls of reality ripple like a mirage, revealing cracks through which an impossible light spills forth. It isn’t light like I’ve ever seen—colors that have no names, shifting from ultraviolet to infrared in a heartbeat, yet somehow also existing beyond both. I reach out, and my fingers pass through the veil.  

Suddenly, I am not just *seeing* the unseen—I am shaping it.  

The space between atoms unfolds before me like an infinite origami, and I tug at the hidden threads. A cluster of stars swirls into being at my whim, not distant suns but something stranger—tiny, luminous gateways humming with cryptic melodies. From them, *things* emerge: liquid silver spheres that unfurl into clockwork butterflies, their wings etched with glyphs that tell stories of forgotten worlds.  

The floor beneath me is no longer solid but a vast, shifting mosaic of countless possibilities. Each tile is a scene from a reality that could have been—or might yet be. I step onto one, and suddenly I am standing in a city where time flows backward. Raindrops rise from puddles; conversations unravel mid-sentence; butterflies crawl back into cocoons. I exhale, and the vision dissolves, reforming into something else entirely—an alien forest where trees glow with bioluminescent veins, whispering in a language made of scent instead of sound.  

And then, the most dizzying realization: I am not merely observing. I am *making*. My thoughts condense into new forms, materializing like ink bleeding through wet parchment. I imagine a bridge between dimensions, and it twists into existence—a structure of impossible geometry, spiraling through multiple planes at once, defying physics yet holding firm. With a thought, I sculpt a creature from the raw energy of the unseen, a being of pure vibration that sings in harmonies that bend the air like heatwaves.  

But the deeper I go, the more the dream responds. The boundaries between *me* and *it* blur. Am I creating—or am I being *rewritten*? The visions pour into me, filling my mind with revelations too vast to hold. I see equations that explain the universe, written not in numbers but in emotions. I see the birth and death of civilizations that worshiped concepts instead of gods. I feel the pulse of time itself, a colossal serpent devouring its own tail in an endless loop.  

And just as the dream threatens to swallow me whole—  
  
I wake.  
  
The afterimage lingers—a fading resonance in my fingertips, the ghost of a universe that briefly answered to my will. For a fleeting moment, I remember how to see *beyond* again—but the knowledge slips like water through my grasp. Still, something remains. A whisper. A promise. The undeniable certainty that the unseen is not so far away after all. That perhaps, if I reach just a little further next time... I might pull it all back into being.
