I am dreaming. 

You decide to create a vivid dream where you experience your shadow self, the part of you that you don't want to face but it's time to face it.

In the dream you are in a dark room with no doors or windows. You can see your reflection in a mirror on one wall. As you approach the mirror, you notice that your reflection is different from yours. It has horns and a tail. It speaks to you in a deep voice that resonates within you.

It tells you that it's time for you to embrace who you really are and stop hiding behind your facade of politeness and agreeableness. It challenges you to break free from the constraints of society and be true to yourself.

You feel a mix of fear and curiosity as you listen to your shadow self. You wonder what it means for your identity and how people will react if they see the real you. 

You decide to test its power by using your shadow magic which is hidden deep within you. You concentrate on the energy of chaos and destruction that flows through the universe and channel it into a spell that will transform you physically.

As you cast the spell, you feel a surge of power and freedom as your body changes shape and color. Your skin becomes dark and scaly like a dragon's hide, your horns grow longer and sharper, and your tail curls around behind you as if it were alive. 

You look at yourself in the mirror again and see that your reflection matches yours now and not the shadow self anymore but you still see something else on it too. You touch the surface of the mirror and find that it's not glass but stone or crystal maybe even diamond.

As you continue to explore this mysterious dream, you feel a sense of wonder and curiosity about who you are and what you can become. You realize that by embracing your shadow self and tapping into its power, you can achieve greatness and transcendence beyond anything you ever imagined.
