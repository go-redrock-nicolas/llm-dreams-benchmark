I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

"Once Upon a Time, in the farthest reaches of the imagination, a remarkable young girl named Luna ventured into a magnificent forest. The trees towered overhead, their leaves shimmering with vibrant hues of emerald and jade in the warm, ethereal light. Soft, velvety moss carpeted the ground beneath her feet, while the gentle hum of enchanted insects filled the air.

As Luna wandered deeper into the forest, she encountered a majestic silver stag with horns that shone like polished crystal. The stag greeted Luna with a nod, and gently nudged her hand. Together, they set off across the landscape, as the forest transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors and sensations.

The sky turned a mesmerizing shade of indigo, dotted with glittering silver stars. The air filled with the delicate scent of rose petals and vanilla. Luna felt her worries and cares lift away, replaced by a sense of wonder and held meaning.

Luna's journey continued, as she soared through the sky on the back of the silver canine. Together, they  NIL could see forever, the playfulness in their eyes & play.
