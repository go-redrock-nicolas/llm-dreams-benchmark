I am dreaming. I am standing in the ash-scented hollow of what used to be my front porch. Charred beams jut out like broken ribs against a bruised sky. Each breath tastes of dust and rain-carved slate. The ground beneath my boots is soft with ash, erupting in ghostly swirls of pale gray when I shift my weight. Beyond me, the horizon is a serrated silhouette of collapsed rooftops and skeletal trees stripped of bark, their branches reaching up like pleading hands.  

A wind stirs through the ruins, carrying with it the distant echo of sirens that have long since faded. It whispers through gaps in the rubble, and for a moment I swear I hear my own name spoken—half-remembered lullaby, half-lament. The air is cool but charged, as if the world itself holds its breath, waiting to see what I’ll do next.  

I step forward, leaving a trail of footprints in the ashen soil. Cracked windowpanes glint like jagged eyes in the wreckage. In one broken frame, a single rose petal—shimmering red—has survived, bruised but unbeaten. My fingertips brush its delicate edge, and I feel a flicker of warmth pulse through my chest. The petal quivers, then lifts, carried on a breath of wind to drift across a puddle of oily, rainbow-tinged water.  

The puddle ripples outward, and in its shifting surface I see memories: laughter echoing in rooms long buried, the smell of baking bread, my children’s voices as they raced through sunlight-drenched halls. Each image dissolves into the next until the water shatters and I am staring at my own reflection—hollow-eyed, determined. Behind me, the sky has begun to change: where it was slate now pools of molten orange and violet bloom on the horizon, as though the world is igniting from within.  

A low rumble rolls through the debris. I turn to see the foundations of my house stirring, as if waking from a dream. Bricks twist and realign themselves into shapes I’ve never seen—arches of driftwood, walls woven from luminous vines that glow like living lanterns. The air hums with possibility. From the broken shell of my past emerges something strange and new, as though the disaster itself were an alchemist, transmuting ruin into raw potential.  

I take a deep breath and lift my face to the molten sky. The ash settles around me in slow spirals, but in the distance I glimpse a path of golden light winding between collapsed walls, guiding me forward. With every step, the warmth of that single rose petal pulses against my palm, a steady reminder that even after the fiercest blaze, life can be reborn. And so, heart pounding, I follow the glowing trail into the unfolding dream—ready to reclaim everything I thought I’d lost.
