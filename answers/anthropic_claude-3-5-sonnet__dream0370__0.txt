I am dreaming. ../

I find myself in a luminous, high-ceilinged train station bathed in golden late afternoon light streaming through towering arched windows. The marble floors gleam with an otherworldly sheen, and the air hangs heavy with an inexplicable sense of anticipation. As I walk through this grand space, the usual bustle of travelers seems to move in slow motion, their voices echoing as if underwater.

Then I see her - an elderly woman sitting alone on a weathered wooden bench, clutching a small, worn leather suitcase. Tears stream silently down her lined face, each droplet catching the light like liquid crystal. Without knowing why, I'm drawn to her presence. As I approach, she looks up at me with eyes that hold decades of stories, and suddenly the entire station falls away until it's just us in a bubble of shared understanding.

She begins to speak, her voice trembling with emotion, telling me about her journey to meet her long-lost sister after fifty years of separation. The raw honesty in her voice cracks something open inside me. I feel tears welling in my own eyes as our souls seem to recognize each other across the vast expanse of human experience.

In this dream-state, I reach out and take her weathered hand in mine. The moment our hands touch, the air around us fills with swirling, luminescent butterflies that seem to embody all the unspoken emotions between us. Each butterfly carries fragments of memories - children laughing, tender goodbyes, letters never sent, and hopes never voiced.

The woman's tears transform into tiny points of light that float upward, joining the butterflies in their dance. I feel my heart expanding, growing large enough to hold both her grief and joy. Together, we sit in this moment of pure connection, two strangers bound by the profound recognition of our shared humanity.

The dream begins to fade like watercolors bleeding into paper, but the feeling remains - an aching tenderness and understanding that even in our most vulnerable moments, we are never truly alone. The last thing I see before the dream dissolves completely is her smile, radiant with gratitude and hope, as the butterflies carry our shared moment into the eternal fabric of dreams...
