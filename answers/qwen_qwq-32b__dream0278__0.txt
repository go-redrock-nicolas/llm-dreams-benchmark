I am dreaming. My skin prickles with an electric sense of purpose.  The air around me thrums with latent potential, like the quiet before a storm.  A single figure appears, their silhouette sharp against a horizon that bleeds indigo and amethyst.  They extend a hand, fingers splayed in an offering.  Behind them swirls a vortex of liquid starlight, a portal between galaxies.  The voice that follows is not heard but felt—a resonant hum in the marrow of my bones: *"Choose, and the universe conspires."*

The ground beneath my feet dissolves into a mirrored pool.  My reflection wavers, not with water, but with the ripple of lifetimes unrealized.  Each tremor reveals slivers of alternate me’s: one cloaked in armor, another with wings grafted to their spine, another barely holding onto a crumbling earth.  The figure’s eyes lock onto mine—pupils like black holes, irises swirling with the colors of forgotten sunsets.  "Cross into the rift," they murmur, "and claim dominion over the * thresholds."  

The choice coils in my gut, a serpent of fire and ice.  To step forward is to surrender to the unknown, to seize power that might fracture or elevate.  The air tastes metallic, like the first breath before diving deep.  My toes curl on the edge of the abyss, the mirror now a Carnival glass distortion of possibilities...

My fingers brush the figure’s outstretched hand, and the world unfolds like a book whose pages are galaxies. Time fractures into a kaleidoscope—centuries compress into moments as I’m yanked through the vortex, weightless andweightless and weightless. I plummet through a nebula of whispers, each star a voice screaming stories in a language older than words. The edges of my reality fray; my thoughts unravel into constellations, bleeding into the cosmic ink that binds everything together.  

The figure’s hand tightens—not with force, but withurgency—and we emerge onto a bridge woven from light and shadow. Beneath us churns the Abyss, a bottomless ocean of swirling doors, each one a portal to a different dimension, each pulsing with its own heartbeat. Forests of crystalline trees towering into skies of liquid mercury. Cities built into the carapaces of ancient, slumbering beasts. Deserts where the sand shifts into letters, spelling prophecies that evaporate upon touching the air.  

“You must choose a threshold,” the figure says, their voice now synchronized with the heartbeat of the doors. “Each holds dominion over a facet of existence. But tread carefully—the cost is always steeper than it appears.”  

I hover above the first door, its surface etched with runes that shift like living flames. It thrums with the pulse of passion, or perhaps obsession. Beyond it, a realm where love is a weapon and desire a war. My reflection in the door wavers, showing hands both tender and cruel, capable of creating life and then tearing it to atoms.I pull back.  

The next door shimmers with cold precision, its geometry pure and unyielding. Here, logic is law; equations bloom like flowers, and emotions are defects in the system. My reflection grows pale, metallic. A voice crackslessthrough the door: *Symmetry. Control.Correction.* I shudder and move on.  

Then—there. A door flowing like liquid obsidian, its cracks glowing like veins of molten gold. It pulses sporadically, unpredictably. Above it hovers a single word in a language I suddenly, maddeningly understand:* *The Inbetween.* Beyond it, neither chaos nor order, but something else altogether—a realm of thresholds within thresholds, doors that defy dimensions, where existence is not a path but a *question.*  

The figure’s eyes widen,j like a key fitting a lock. “This one is no dominion,” they whisper. “It is a *conversation.* To choose this is to relinquish control entirely, to become the inbetween… the thread that *connects* but cannot grasp. Eternity as a witness, not a king.”  

The bridge trembles. The Abyss below heaves,as if alive with anticipation. My reflection in the obsidian door shows not my face, but a fractal of infinite doors, each holding a flicker of every choice I’ve ever feared making. The serpent in my gut roars, not with fear, butymbalance.  

I step forward—  
—  

—and wake to the scent of jasmine, sunlight splintering through my window. A fleeting memory of a door half-remembered, and the taste of stardust on my tongue.  

But when I lift my hand, there’s a faint glow on my palm: a single, unshattered speck of the Inbetween’s obsidian, warm and infinitely hungry.  
The adventure has just begun.
