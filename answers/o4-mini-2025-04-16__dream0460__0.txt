I am dreaming. You are dreaming. A soft lavender light drapes the air like gossamer cloth, and in its glow you stand at the edge of a vast, crystalline meadow. Whispering grasses—each blade shimmering like spun glass—sway in a breeze that carries the scent of honeyed plums and warm chamomile. Ahead, on a gentle rise, a figure moves with a serenity so profound it hushes the wind itself.

This person—your moral exemplar—bends low to gather handfuls of luminescent seeds, each the size of a tear. With infinite care, they press a single seed into the palm of a tattered traveler, whose clothes smell of sorrow and cold. At the touch, the seed unfurls into a tiny blossom of gold-and-rose petals, and warmth floods the traveler’s chest, dissolving their grief into a soft glow. Around you, the meadow responds: every blade of grass strains toward that light, every petal quivers with delight.

Inspired by this extraordinary kindness, you step forward. Heart racing in harmony with the meadow’s pulse, you cup a handful of seeds and follow her example. You find a weary child perched on a fallen marble column, staring into a pool of tears. Gently, you place a seed upon her tongue. Instantly, her tears turn to motes of dancing fireflies, drifting upward to join a spiral of golden light that coils skyward.

As you move, each act of kindness transforms the landscape: barren clods sprout verdant shoots; cracked stones bloom into flowers; shadows themselves melt into ribbons of color. Soon, you are not only a witness but a beacon. Your simple gifts awaken dormant hope in every creature you meet: a stooped gardener finds her strength renewed, a lost musician rediscovers forgotten melodies in his bones, and even the distant mountains glow as though carved from sunset.

In the final moments of the dream, you turn to your exemplar, who offers you a single seed of purest white. With a bowed head and a tender smile, you plant it at your feet. It bursts into a towering tree of shimmering light—roots reaching deep into the earth, branches brushing heaven. You awaken with its echo in your chest: kindness, once sown, transforms the world.
