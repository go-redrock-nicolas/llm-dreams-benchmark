I am dreaming. As I drift away into this ethereal world, my mind evolves. Mesmerizing sunsets and glowing moons dance in an interlude of the most spectacular and serene of landscapes. Within my subconscious, I am granted the extraordinary capacity of perfect photographic memory. 

With this gift, I find myself cataloging every detail I wish to recall. The exact words of literature I've read, the intricate patterns of flowers in a garden, the harmonious melodies of symphonies - all optimized in my mind, appropriate to be called forth at will.

Playful, colorful scenarios dance before me. I envision images of me attending lavish parties with the world's most influential minds - quoting their works from memory and engaging in stimulating conversations. People from all walks of life gather around, allowing me to paint a new portrait with my words garnering an audience at the herbalist in a breezy chinese summer. Everyone is always hoping to learn, learn from me, a vessel of information, a means to ends and a magnetizing stimulus. Which when faced amply, only conveys greater inclinations of elevating each and all.

In my dream, a never ending novel of memoirs spanning us - us we being primarily you and me - you with eyes of both imagination and art, me as the keeper of memory - so very vivid am I as your canvas upon which our illustrator analyses upon. To be given memory beyond memory takes me farther than from the progression of the memoirist. I merely, stop, try, just envision, anything and everything.
