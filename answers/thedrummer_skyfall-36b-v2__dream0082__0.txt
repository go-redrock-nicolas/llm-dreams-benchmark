I am dreaming. The scene unfolds in a surreal landscape, a twisted fusion of the familiar and the bizarre. Towering skyscrapers made of shattered mirrors stretch towards an overcast sky, reflecting a kaleidoscope of fractured images. The air is thick with an eerie stillness, broken only by the distant sound of a distorted siren's wail.

You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, empty plaza, its cracked concrete stretching out like a barren desert. In the center stands the figure you recognize - a close friend, an intimate soul you hold dearest in your heart. They are bathed in a sickening pale glow, seemingly oblivious to your presence, their eyes fixed on some distant point beyond the horizon.

A mysterious force compels you closer, as if pulled by an invisible string. Each step is heavy, reluctant, a growing dread settling in the pit of your stomach. As you approach, the friend turn to you, and in that moment, you see it - a look of confusion, fear, and betrayal in their eyes. You realize then that you have awoken with a horrifying memory.

The information you now possess is a poison in your mind, a sinister secret that would cause unimaginable pain to this dear one. It is a truth that threatens to shatter the delicate facade of their reality, to strip away the comfort of ignorance and  their world with a harrowing new. A new reality that you alone know that they face. You look into their eyes, into their eyes you see their trust.

They continue their life, blissfully unaware of the toxic truth you harbor. They laugh, they love, they live - all while you stand on the precipice of sickness, of destroying their entire world. The burden of your knowledge weighs heavy upon your shoulders, a millstone grinding away at your sanity.

The dream world warps and twists, reality bleeding into nightmare. The fractured skyscrapers tilt and sway, the cracked concrete splits and crumbles away like sand. The siren's wail grows louder, more insistent, drowning out the laughter of your friend, the beat of your own heart.

You are a prisoner in this hellish tableau, a warden and a conspirator, a keeper of a secret that will destroy everything you hold dear. And as the world falls apart around you, the dream morphs into the inevitable, the irrefutable conclusion - you will have to decide.
