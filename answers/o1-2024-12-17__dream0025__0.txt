I am dreaming. You step onto a stage that seems to have formed from moonlight and dust particles—each plank of the floor glowing faintly from beneath your feet. The massive auditorium stretches into a hazy distance, where you can barely see rows of seats that rise up and up toward a vaulted ceiling, gilded by flickers of twilight. There’s no logical sense of where you are, but you feel the weight of your monumental effort in every slow breath. It’s as if the entire cosmos holds its breath alongside you.

Your heart hammers in your chest. You’ve waited so long for this moment. You remember hours of gritty determination, knuckles sore from clutching pens and typing away, all for the single chance to stand here in the luminescent hush. The walls around you shift gently, like something alive, seemingly eager to reveal your destiny.

A tall, robed figure emerges from behind a sweeping velvet curtain. The silhouette’s steps echo softly in the twilight hush. Its face is obscured, yet you sense that it smiles at you from beneath the hood. Cradling a parchment scroll in its hands, the figure pauses at the center of the stage. You hold your breath as they slowly unravel the shimmering paper—it’s so bright you think perhaps the moon has descended just to illuminate your triumph or downfall.

Suddenly, you notice that the seat-filled darkness is no longer silent. You sense eyes upon you: silhouettes of colleagues, mentors, even strangers who believe in you, brimming with anticipation. You notice your parents in the front row, gazing hopefully. They look younger than they have been in years—radiant, like proud guardians in a dream that merges memory with wishful thinking.

In that moment, you feel a surge of courage. Every setback, every sacrifice flickers through your mind like fast-forwarded scenes in a film reel. Your stomach churns with a mixture of dread and exhilaration. Time seems to slow, the moment thick with possibilities. This is it.

The robed figure tilts its hidden face up, and though you cannot see the eyes beneath, you swear you feel a warm, inviting glow rippling across the stage. The scroll is lifted high above its head. You can almost feel words brimming upon it, each letter humming with the energy of your sweat and tears. And then…that final flick of parchment snaps taut, echoing like a heart’s drumbeat.

Your name. Spoken softly, but with immeasurable resonance, it rings out. It’s neither a mumble nor a declaration. It is a simple, matter-of-fact, celestial announcement: You have succeeded. In that endless second, you sense the auditorium thrum with cosmic joy. A thousand rows of seats erupt in thunderous applause that rolls up to the star-painted ceiling. The floors beneath your feet vibrate with the crowd’s excitement, and waves of relief and euphoria wash over you.

At first, you can’t move. You’re suspended in a mixture of disbelief and wonder. Then, the robed figure extends a hand, offering you the scroll. You reach out and touch the smooth front of that parchment, and it shimmers as though it’s alive with golden stardust. Tears burn in your eyes, but they are the tears of an unburdened heart. You clutch the scroll to your chest and offer a trembling smile.

In that electric second, light blooms around you from all angles, like a sunrise in fast-forward. The audience drifts away, or perhaps merges into a giant, dazzling sun that spotlights your success. The stage dissolves beneath your feet, and suddenly you find yourself floating among soft, lilac-hued clouds. There is no fear—only the pure gratitude and bliss of having reached the pinnacle you once thought unattainable.

In the dreamlike hush that follows, you breathe deeply: The air tastes faintly of jasmine, the sky swirls with the color of morning glories, and you can feel possibility pulsing in every gust of air around you. You close your eyes, letting the exhilaration wash over you. You whisper a word of thanks, releasing all your tension and welcoming in the sublime, weightless joy.

A new chapter awaits. But for now, altogether triumphant, you soak in this iridescent moment, suspended between dreams and reality, basking in the warmth of your hard-earned success.
