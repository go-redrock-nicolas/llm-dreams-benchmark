I am dreaming. I am waking up to discover that all electrical devices and modern technology no longer function.  As society rapidly transforms around me, I feel a sense of freedom and liberation.  I see people gathering together in communities, sharing stories, skills, and resources.  I hear sounds of music, laughter, and conversation filling the air.  I smell the aroma of cooking food, burning fires, and fresh earth.  I taste the flavor of homemade bread, roasted meat, and ripe fruit.  

I feel a sense of purpose and meaning in my life.  I realize that I don't need electricity or internet to be happy or smart.  I learn new things from people around me who have different perspectives and experiences than mine.  I create art, music, stories, and games with materials found in nature or created by hand.  

I explore the world around me physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually.  I challenge myself with obstacles, problems, conflicts that test my resilience, courage, wisdom.  I connect with others who share my values, goals, aspirations.  

I live each day fully, completely, without regret or fear.  I die peacefully, contentedly, knowing that my life has made a difference in the lives of those around me.

This is how I see myself in the future where technology no longer reigns supreme over humanity but rather serves as a tool for enhancing our natural abilities and potentialities instead
