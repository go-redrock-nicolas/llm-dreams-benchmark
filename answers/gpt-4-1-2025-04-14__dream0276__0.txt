I am dreaming.

In the velvety hush before dawn, I find myself drifting through a labyrinthine garden unlike anything from my waking life. Each pathway twists and winds beneath canopies woven from silver branches, their leaves whispering soft secrets in a language I almost remember. The air is heavy with the scent of moss and moonflowers, the petals glistening as if they carry droplets of star-light.

As I wander, I discover a scatter of treasures half-buried along the path: a pebble glinting with opal fire, the flute-song of a distant bird, a warm patch of sunlight illuminating the palm of my hand. Once, such minor gifts might have slipped past me, unnoticed, lost in the tide of grander ambitions. But now, each tiny discovery makes my heart leap as though I have uncovered a hidden world. Picking up the luminescent pebble, I gaze into its swirling colors and feel a deep, effervescent joy fizz through my chest—this is reward enough.

Reflecting on this change, I see the landscape of my motivation in vivid, shifting hues. I recognize how, once, I chased only the distant, towering marvels—the soaring castle on the hill, the crown of wind-struck laurels, achievements that loomed so large they cast everything else into shadow. But now, in the gentle logic of dreams, something has tilted within me. The smallest joys set off cascades of pleasure; the tiniest victories gleam brighter than jewels. I feel newly attuned to the cadence of quiet wonders: the cool kiss of dew on my bare feet, the soft miracle of a seedling pushing through stone, the glow of dawn curled along the horizon.

Here, among the tangled paths and blooming surprises, I realize that my hunger for sensation, accomplishment, and life itself is repatterning. I have become sensitive to miracles in miniature, rich with gratitude for each small sweetness. My heart dances to the music of humble rewards, learning, at last, to taste the infinite tucked inside the fleeting. And in this dream, beneath ever-shifting skies, I sense that even when I wake, this gentler compass might guide me, if only I choose to remember.
