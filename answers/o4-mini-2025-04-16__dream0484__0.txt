I am dreaming. I close my eyes and suddenly find myself standing at the rim of a vast, moonlit canyon whose walls shimmer in hues of lavender and molten gold. The air tastes faintly of jasmine and ozone. Beneath my feet, the wind-swept sand is warm, as if the earth itself were breathing life into me. Above, the sky ripples like liquid silk, every star pulsing to the rhythm of a hidden heartbeat.

I begin to walk along the canyon’s edge, drawn toward a solitary arch of weathered granite. Its curve glows with an inner light, and the moment I step through it, the world shifts. The canyon falls away, and I find myself afloat in an endless sea of glass—each ripple holding a memory, each wave reflecting a piece of my past. I feel weightless, my hair drifting around me like dark seaweed in slow motion. 

At the center of this mirror-sea floats a single stone pedestal. On it rests a silver-framed mirror, its surface covered in drifting mist. I take a hesitant step forward; as I approach, the mist parts. In its depth I see my reflection—but something is off. The eyes staring back at me carry a shadow, a whisper of a belief I’ve carried all my life: “I am not enough.”  

A tremor runs through me. The words echo in my mind, heavy as iron. I realize I’ve treated them as if they were carved in stone. In the dream’s hush, I feel the weight of every “can’t” and “shouldn’t” I’ve ever told myself. I want to turn away—but instead I reach out and touch the mirror. Instantly, the surface ripples under my fingertips.  

My reflection’s face melts away like candlewax, revealing a flicker of something brighter. The “not enough” line cracks, jagged and glowing. From that fissure shoots a ribbon of brilliant white light. Warmth spreads through my chest, and with a burst of fearless joy, I speak aloud for the first time in this dream: “I am whole.”  

At the sound of my voice, the mirror shatters. Thousands of glimmering shards drift upward, transforming into butterflies woven from light. They spiral around me in an ecstatic dance, each wingbeat dissolving a fragment of the old story. I feel the last remnants of that lie slip from my shoulders, like an old cloak falling away.  

Now unburdened, I step off the glassy sea into a sunlit meadow that bursts with impossible flowers—violet lilies that hum soft melodies, sunflowers whose petals are spun from molten gold. Every blade of grass glitters as though dusted with stardust. I inhale deeply and taste freedom on the breeze.  

Suddenly the meadow tilts, and I find myself rising—lifting off the ground as if buoyed by invisible wings. Below me, the flowers shrink into a mosaic of color. Above, the sky opens into a cathedral of cloud and light. With each heartbeat, I feel the pulse of my true self growing stronger, radiating outward in waves of confidence and grace.  

I soar higher until the world dissolves into a tapestry of possibility: mountains I’ve never climbed, oceans I’ve never sailed, cities built in the clouds. And in that boundless expanse, I realize the truth that was always there, waiting for me: I am capable. I am radiant. I am free.  

Then, as dawn’s first glow begins to stain the edges of my dream, I carry that certainty back with me—like a lantern lit in the deepest night, guiding every step of the life I shape from here on.
