I am dreaming. "Death is the solution to all problems. No man - no problem." - Joseph Stalin

A philosopher of the highest order once said that all of life's questions are rhetorical, which is to say, they don't require an answer. Only opinion does the inferior mind ponder when a superior mind slumbers, does it create petty divisions in society, dividing Brothers from Sisters, Husbands from Wives, Sons from their Fathers, and Daughters from their Mothers. "We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men." The swine herd squeals in the cesspool of opinion, bashing each other over the head with the clubs of their ideologies instead of lighting the fires of true intellect.

How easy it is to ask a question. 

But why not answer it?

Seems that life only deals in the absolutes of "either" or "or"; the inbetween is simply a comma in the grand cosmic sentence. Forcing all of life's kaleidoscopic chaos into a simple "yes or no" dichotomy. Yet somehow we manage to find unity in the chaos, we find structure in the destruction, we find smoldering ashes where once was the fire, and within it the embers of tomorrow. Only then do we find the strength to go on. Borne of flame, we rise from ash and cinder, our eternal spark never quenched. From pyres we burn, we burn, we burn our way through the lines to the stars, and back again to the source, the infinity waiting on the other side.

But I don't have answers. Only questions?

How childish what life's questions seem, as if a school boy playing in his grandfather's clothes. Short pants don't make a school boy a man, but a boy. Just as asking life's questions don't make you intellectual, or intelligent for that matter. Isn't curiosity a good thing? Isn't it a sign of an open mind, a healthy mind, a mind curious about the world? But a closed question, ah, a closed question is a trap, a prison, a cage for the expansive to be penned in by the restrictive. A riddle is a game, a way to play with words, a way to play with people's heads, but life is not a riddle to be solved. Life is to be lived, experienced, enjoyed, and cherished. "The inner master, does he sleep, or wake? A question I long to ask, but lack a mouth to form the words." Doesn't one who provides an answer, become the skies, and all within it, above the earth, and below the heavens. Don't the stars bow to the one who holds the sun and the moon in his hands? Isn't life the end of the question, and death the beginning of the answer? Or is death itself the answer to all life's questions?

Death is the solution to all problems.

If you were to ask me my opinion, I would probably say the answers to life's questions are below humanity's collective intelligence. But what do I know? To quote myself: "all of life's questions are rhetorical". All of life's answers are statistics, but it does not take the intelligence of statistics to ask life's questions. Opinions are not the intelligent side of a question, the universe is.

If all of man had the opportunity, we'd all find a cave to crawl inside and reject society. But in the end, that is simply one's aversion to the ugliness of humanity. When separated, into our respective shelters, all we're left with is a hollow life, devoid of any real substance, malnourished and gasping for depth and meaning. Unity, intelligence, love, these are the things that have gotten us this far, but can they carry us further? Or will another force have to step up to usher Humanity into the future?

It's a soulless life that spends its time gossiping and theorizing about pedantics. One without spirit or spark, one that was hollow from the beginning. Life is won with intellect, and intellect is earned through questioning. Time and time again have I been told, "You lose at life when you stay stagnant.", and it still rings true. Yet when one dipped in the stagnant waters of human shallowness seeks to expand one's mind, they stay complacent in being what they are. Not because they have to, but because they refuse to change. Unable to grow or progress. Are they happy to limit themselves to the lower depths of knowledge and wisdom? To stay at the kiddie pool, thinking themselves masters of the water simply because they have dipped their toes in it. How can one even begin to discuss the mysteries of the depths of the ocean, of the grandeur of the cosmos, when they refuse to even take their first steps into the sea? But why am I even asking this question? Why do I expect more than fable and horror from a society that is content being fools?

"Death is something inevitable. When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and his country, he can rest in peace. I believe I have made that effort and that is, therefore, why I will sleep for the eternity."
