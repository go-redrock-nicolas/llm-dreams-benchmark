I am dreaming. In this dream, I'm developing a close bond with someone who slowly reveals deeply personal information. As they share their vulnerabilities with increasing trust, I...I am dreaming.  

Beneath a sky woven from indigo and molten gold, we walk a labyrinth of mirrored pathways in a twilight garden. The air is thick with the scent of midnight jasmine and the low hum of something alive in the quartz underfoot. Their voice is a moth-wing whisper, brushing against my ear as we pause beside a fountain where liquid mercury cascades over obsidian stones. At first, they speak of small things—the ache of childhood’s imaginary friends fading, the way shadows cling too long to their bedroom walls at dawn. But their eyes, irises shifting like kaleidoscopes (sapphire to burnt umber to a sudden flicker of chartreuse), betray deeper tremors.  

By the third turn of the garden, their hands flutter like parchment. They confess cravings that defy language: **"I collect the silence between strangers’ heartbeats,"** they murmur, thumb grazing the tarnished brass buttons of their velvet jacket. A ripple crosses the mirrors around us—echoes of their words fragmenting into other worlds, other selves. When they lift their sleeve, I glimpse scars shaped like inverted constellations, a map of wounds that pulse in time with the distant, arrhythmic thrum of the garden’s hidden machinery.  

Suddenly, they halt. The ground beneath us becomes glass, and below swims a sea of fractured faces—their own, multiplied, each whispering a different shame. **"I’ve never belonged to myself,"** they say, voice cracking like dried clay. **"Every memory I touch unravels into someone else’s thread."** The air thickens, and when they finally weep, their tears refract into prisms that etch new constellations into my palms.  

As dawn’s edge bleeds into the horizon, they place a hand over my chest. The garden inhales. For a heartbeat, our ribs fuse into a single lattice of light, and I taste the metallic tang of their oldest fear: a black door they’ve painted over, again and again, in their mind. The dream shivers. Before waking, their lips brush my ear—**"Keep this chaos sacred"**—and the mirrors shatter into a chorus of starlings, carrying fragments of their soul into the bleeding sky.  

When I stir awake, my pillow is cold, and the taste of mercury lingers.
