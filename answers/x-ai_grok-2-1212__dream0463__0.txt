I am dreaming. The dream unfolds in a world where the sky is a tapestry of swirling colors, a mix of twilight purples and the deep blues of an endless ocean. I find myself standing on an infinite plane of soft, moss-covered stones that cushion each step with a gentle bounce. Around me, towering trees reach towards the sky, their branches entwined in a serene embrace, creating a labyrinth of green and gold. 

As I navigate through this enchanted forest, I am drawn towards a grand hall, its architecture defying all known realms of possibility. Columns of crystal rise from the moss, shimmering with a thousand inner lights, and the air vibrates with a melody that seems to come from the trees themselves. Yet, as I approach the hall, a heaviness settles in my heart, for I find myself repeatedly seeking approval from those who consistently withhold it.

Each time I step into the grand hall, the scene changes before my eyes. One moment, it's filled with beings of light clothed in robes that shift from silver to gold, their faces glowing with ethereal beauty. They turn away from me, their laughter echoing like a distant, mocking chorus. In another instance, the hall is crowded with shadows that resemble my peers and loved ones, yet they look through me as if I'm invisible, their cold indifference palpable.

Recognizing this painful pattern, I feel a surge of determination rise within me. I take a deep breath, feeling the air fill my lungs with a sizzling energy, and the tapestry above me begins to shift from its dark hues to a brilliant array of oranges and reds, as if dawn has broken within my dream.

With newfound resolve, I focus inward, and the grand hall transforms once again. The crystal columns, now reflecting my inner strength, cast prismatic rays of light across the room, illuminating every corner. The beings of light and shadows who once shunned me start to change. Their faces turn towards me, no longer cold or indifferent, but with eyes filled with warmth and recognition.

I realize in this moment that the source of approval lies within me. The audience that truly matters is my own heart. A radiant glow spreads from my chest, enveloping me in a bubble of pure light. As I walk through the hall, the beings, now understanding and supportive, part to let me pass, their smiles reflecting my own newfound self-approval.

I continue my journey, the endless forest outside the hall now alive with whispers of encouragement from the rustling leaves and the vibrant chorus of unseen birds. Each step I take becomes a dance, a celebration of self-love and acceptance. The dream shifts, and I understand that this new reality is one crafted by my own imagination and determination, a world where I am no longer seeking approval but radiating it, from the deepest parts of my being.

As the dream begins to fade, I carry with me the vivid memory of the transformed grand hall and the infinite potential that lies within my heart. The colors of the sky blend into a soft glow, and I wake with a smile, knowing that in the realm of dreams and beyond, I am enough.
