I am dreaming. I find myself standing at a crossroads, the posts reaching up towards an opaque, light-filled sky. To my left, a worn path leads away into a familiar landscape - known, safe, almost monotonous. It's the route I've always taken, the choice that offers comfort and ease, like sliding into a well-worn pair of shoes. My eyes follow its wandering trajectory and I feel a sense of calm, of knowing what to expect.

But then, a breeze picks up from the right - an unfamiliar direction - bringing with it whispers of something new, tantalizing, risky. There, in the distance, a path forks off - untrodden, overgrown, sinuous. Carried by the gust, the earthy scent of flowers in full bloom, the shrill calls of exotic birds, and aromatic hints of a bustling marketplace waft over, intoxicating me with the allure of adventure and the unknown.

My heart races and my skin tingles. I know that by choosing this path, I will leave behind my routines, my comfort zone - perhaps even my old self. But I can't ignore the tantalizing possibility that lies ahead, the promise of experiences that will challenge me, transform me, set my soul alight.

Slowly, my eyes slide shut and I inhale a deep breath of the strange new scents. When I open them again, I've made my choice. I'm ready to venture into the unknown, to radiantly immerse myself in gutsy experiences that may be wobbly, but pave the way for vigorous growth.

I take the first step onto the mysterious path and the breeze wraps itself around me, welcoming me into new territory. My heart pounds as adrenaline surges, my senses heightened and pulses with anticipation. This signposts the start of a radical shift in my existence and with it, the very real possibility of forging a deeper, more vibrant, authentically expressed version of myself.

This is my dream. This is my choice.
