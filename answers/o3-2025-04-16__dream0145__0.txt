I am dreaming.

The dream opens like a book whose pages are made of moonlight. I stand at the edge of a continent-sized library, its shelves carved from armored whale-bones that creak with every gust of wind. The sky above is not a sky at all but a velvet ocean hung upside-down, scattered with constellations that drift like glowing jellyfish. For what feels like epochs I have roamed these aisles, hunting for a single sentence said to change the fate of anyone who reads it. Each time I come close—each time I taste the syllables on the air—the words dissolve into smoke between my fingers. The failures pile up like fallen parchment, brittle and accusing.

Tonight, at last, I reach the library’s farthest wall: a colossal mirror framed in rusted copper, tall enough to scrape the undersides of the stars. Etched across its surface are the fingerprints of every time I’ve tried and fallen short. The mirror is the final obstacle, whispering doubts in a hundred overlapping voices—my own voice, but fractured, multiplied.

The floor underfoot yawns apart, and I stagger onto a narrow bridge of quills, each feather larger than a cathedral spire. Below is a yawning chasm filled with shredded drafts of forgotten dreams; they whirl in a blizzard of abandoned intentions. A frigid wind snatches at my coat, but I press on, heart hammering like a frantic librarian throwing books back on the shelf.

Halfway across, the quills begin to tremble, morphing into giant fountain pens that leak rivers of ink. The ink pools on the bridge, forming oily puddles that reflect alternate versions of me—versions who surrendered, versions who turned back. Their eyes glow with regret; their mouths shape words I can’t hear but somehow understand: You will fall as we did.

A voice—quiet, steady—rises inside: Keep going.

I reach the mirror. It towers overhead, reflecting not just my body but my entire history layered upon itself: every botched attempt, every missed chance, the small humiliations and the crushing defeats. They flicker like moths inside the glass, begging to be believed. My knees buckle under the weight of their accusation.

But amid the swirling scenes I spot a glimmer: a single memory where I stood upright, face brimming with raw determination after yet another failure. That version of me leans forward, extends a hand through the mirror’s surface, and clasps my wrist. The glass ripples like mercury around us.

“Step through,” says the reflection—my own voice sure and resonant, unburdened by dread. “You’ve carried these ghosts long enough.”

I inhale, lungs filling with a scent like petrichor mixed with stardust. Summoning every ragged fragment of resolve, I walk into the mirror. The surface gives way, cool and viscous, enveloping me in liquid silver. For an instant it feels as if I’m dissolving—bones, doubts, memories suspended in light—and the fear is a thunderclap. Yet just when I think I’ll vanish entirely, I burst out the other side.

I emerge on a cliff of luminous quartz overlooking an aurora-lit sea. A gentle rain falls upward, droplets ascending into the clouds to join a storm that’s already passed. My reflection is gone, replaced by a field of glass flowers, each petal etched with a word I thought I’d lost: Courage, Wonder, Persistence, Grace.

The insurmountable obstacle was never an external wall; it was the echo chamber of my own disbelief. In the hush that follows, I realize the failure-voices have gone silent, replaced by the soft thrumming of possibility.

I kneel, pluck a single glass bloom, and as it rests in my palm it transforms into a fountain pen—smooth, silver, brimming with fresh ink. I’ve crossed the final threshold. I can write the sentence that once eluded me, not because it hides somewhere in those labyrinthine shelves, but because it’s been inside my lungs, my pulse, my stubborn breathing all along.

So I set nib to the sky itself, tracing words on the aurora like constellations:

“I rise, not despite my fractures, but because of them.”

The letters ignite, cascading across the heavens, and the dream shudders with newfound light. The library in the distance unfurls into soaring paper cranes that take flight, scattering failures like dandelion seeds to the wind.

The dream blurs, brightens, blooms—and I wake with the taste of starlight on my tongue, the mirrored doubts left far behind in that impossible library of night.
