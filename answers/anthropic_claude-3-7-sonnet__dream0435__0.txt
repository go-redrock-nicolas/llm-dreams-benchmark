I am dreaming. As consciousness ripples through my mind, I find myself standing at the edge of a vast obsidian lake that reflects not the sky above but rather the thoughts of those who gaze upon it. The air feels charged with possibility, tingling against my skin like gentle electric currents.

I notice how my shoulders unconsciously hunch forward when I approach others on the shoreline—spectral figures with faces that shift between familiar and foreign. When I tense, they retreat; when I open my posture, they draw closer. I've never before realized how loudly my body speaks without words.

A woman with hair that flows upward instead of down—defying gravity as dreams often do—mirrors my movements with exaggerated precision. When I cross my arms, darkness spreads across the lake; when I extend my hand, luminescent fish leap from the water.

"You've been speaking volumes all your life," she says, though her mouth doesn't move. "Every fidget, every glance, every unconscious tilt of your head has shaped the world around you."

I become hyper-aware of my own form—how my feet plant into the soft, breathing earth; how my hands have been clenched without my knowledge; how the angle of my chin has been telling stories I never intended to tell.

The landscape morphs in response to this awareness. Trees bend toward me when I stand tall, flowers bloom when my expression softens, and distant mountains rumble when tension returns to my jaw. The revelation is both terrifying and liberating—I've held this power all along.

The dream deepens as I practice this newfound awareness, deliberately softening my gaze toward a child made of stained glass. The child transforms from sharp edges to gentle curves, laughter spilling forth like chimes.

"This is how you've been shaping realities," whispers the wind. "Not just here, but everywhere."

The knowledge settles into my bones like an ancient truth finally remembered, and the obsidian lake begins to reflect not just thoughts, but possibilities—countless versions of worlds shaped by the silent language of my being.
