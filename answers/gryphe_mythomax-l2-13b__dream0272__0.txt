I am dreaming. I am standing at the edge of a vast, foggy field. In the distance, I can hear the faint sounds of thunder and see the flickering lights of a storm approaching. Around me, there are dozens of people, most of them strangers, standing anxiously, their faces etched with fear and uncertainty.

As I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, I suddenly realize the gravity of the situation. This is no ordinary storm; it's a disaster. The wind has already started to pick up, whipping through our clothes and lifting us off our feet. The rain is coming down harder now, turning the muddy ground into a quagmire.

I look around for anyone in authority, but there seems to be no one else to lead. The responsibility falls solely on me. Gathering my courage, I step forward, raising my voice above the din of the storm.

"Listen up, everyone!" I shout. "We need to take cover immediately! Follow me to the nearest shelter!"

One by one, the strangers begin to follow me, their footsteps slow and hesitant. I can feel the pressure of the responsibility weighing down on me, but I push it aside and focus on guiding them to safety.

As we trudge through the mud and rain, the storm grows more intense, lightning flashing all around us. But I keep going, determined to get everyone to the shelter before it's too late.

Finally, we reach a small building nestled among the trees. It's not much, but it will have to do. I usher the strangers inside, closing the door tightly against the storm.

Inside, it's dim and warm, the only light coming from a few candles and emergency lanterns. The group milled around, some of them huddling together for comfort, others sitting in stunned silence, still trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, I realize that the storm has passed. The wind has died down, and the rain has stopped. I take a deep breath, relieved yet exhausted.

Looking around at the group, I see that they're all looking at me, waiting for me to speak. And that's when it hits me: I may have saved their lives, but I haven't saved myself. For in the deepest parts of my heart, I know that I will forever carry the burden of that night, when I was the one who held the power to guide them through the storm.
