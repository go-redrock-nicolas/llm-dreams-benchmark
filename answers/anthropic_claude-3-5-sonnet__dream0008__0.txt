I am dreaming. I find myself in an office that seems both familiar and strangely distorted - the fluorescent lights above pulse with an otherworldly purple glow, and the walls appear to breathe ever so slightly. My desk, normally a static fixture, now seems to stretch endlessly into a vanishing point I can't quite focus on.

My boss materializes before me, but their face keeps shifting like wet clay, features rearranging themselves in impossible patterns. They hand me a project folder that feels impossibly heavy, as if it contains the weight of a thousand deadlines. The papers inside are covered in text that writhes and crawls across the pages like living insects, refusing to stay still long enough to read.

The clock on the wall spins wildly - backward, forward, sideways - its hands elongating like rubber bands. Each tick echoes through the room like a thunderclap. Colleagues walk past my desk, but they're walking on the ceiling, their ties and hair hanging upward, defying gravity. They cast no shadows.

I try to begin working, but my computer keyboard has turned to gelatin, my fingers sinking into the soft keys that taste faintly of strawberry when I touch them (why can I taste them?). The screen displays a countdown timer showing negative numbers in a language I somehow understand despite never having seen it before.

My boss is still waiting, now hovering several inches above the ground, their shadow moving in the opposite direction from their body. The deadline feels like a physical presence, a dark cloud that's slowly filling the room with a thick, honey-like substance that smells of deadline anxiety and stale coffee.

I open my mouth to speak, but instead of words, tiny origami cranes flutter out, each one carrying a different excuse written in glowing ink. The room continues to warp and bend, the corners of reality folding in on themselves like a cosmic paper airplane, and I realize with growing horror that my desk chair has begun to sprout flowers - flowers that whisper status reports in my grandmother's voice...
