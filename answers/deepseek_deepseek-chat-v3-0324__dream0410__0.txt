I am dreaming. The air hums with a golden luminescence, like the last breath of sunset suspended in liquid amber. I stand at the edge of a vast, twilight-drenched meadow, where the grass sways not with wind, but with the murmured rhythm of forgotten desires. Above, the sky is a shifting tapestry—galaxies bleeding into one another, constellations rewriting themselves in real time, as if the universe is impatient to show me all the paths I’ve ignored.  

A split in the terrain appears before me. To the left, a narrow bridge arches over a chasm so deep it swallows all sound. Its wooden planks are worn smooth by the tread of careful feet, each board labeled with familiar warnings: *Don’t stumble. Don’t fall. Don’t want too much.* To the right, the earth slopes into a sprawling, untamed garden—vines heavy with luminescent fruit, flowers pulsing like heartbeat. Their petals whisper in a language of color, promising wild discoveries, brief sorrows, ecstatic blooms.  

A voice, neither mine nor foreign, curls through the air like smoke: *"Why do you keep choosing the bridge?"*  

I hesitate. The bridge is safe. Predictable. But the garden—oh, the garden thrums with *aliveness*—an invitation to risk the sting of thorns for the delirium of fragrance, the crush of petals underfoot, the chance to taste something so sweet, so fleeting, it might bruise the soul.  

With a breath that tastes of honey and lightning, I step off the well-worn path and into the riot of color. The earth sighs beneath me, tendrils of ivy coiling around my wrists—not to bind, but to guide. A single fruit, glowing like captured moonlight, falls into my palm. As I bite into it, the juice runs down my chin, and for the first time, I understand: *Regret is not the terror of pain—it is the haunting of joys left unlived.*  

The dream dissolves, but the taste lingers.
