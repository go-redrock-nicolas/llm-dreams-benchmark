I am dreaming. I drift into a hall made of honey-gold light, its walls softly breathing as though the very air is alive. Tall, filigreed columns stretch overhead, each carved with twisting vines that pulse with gentle emerald glow. In the center of this cathedral-like chamber sits a circular table of polished obsidian, surrounded by seven figures whose faces shift like moonlight on water. They debate in low, melodic voices, each word a color—crimson anger, sapphire certainty, pale lavender reluctance.  

They argue that the single, giant pearl at the table’s core must be split in half—divided among them—even though it’s rumored to grant its holder a singular vision of the world’s fate. I feel its smooth surface under my palm as if I had reached in from beyond this dream, and a fierce intuition wells inside me. Splitting it would shatter something sacred. Yet every time I open my mouth, my voice turns to mist. The others do not notice my silent terror.  

Around me, the debate swells. The tallest figure, cloaked in shifting sands of silver, slams a hand on the table. “Fair division!” she insists. A flicker of gold sparks in her eyes. Another, with hair like a raven’s wing, shakes his head, drawing shapes in the air with a finger—sharp, mathematical lines. The air tastes of ozone and lilac as they boundary-mark what they claim is “just.”  

My heart thunders. I feel the pearl’s warmth seeping into my bones, urging me onward. My palms sweat on the obsidian surface; my throat constricts. But then I notice how the pearl responds to my doubt—it glows deeper, a pulse in time with my quickening breath. Emboldened, I inch forward, feet brushing the intricate mosaic floor that seems to ripple beneath me.  

All at once I speak. My words emerge in a ribbon of light: “This pearl is not meant for halves. It’s whole because its power lives in unity, in seeing the future as one tapestry, not fractured shards.” My voice echoes, resonant and clear. The breathing walls still, the vines above pause their glow, and each person at the table turns.  

Surprise ripples across their shifting features, then something softer—curiosity, perhaps even relief. The raven-haired figure tilts his head, the mathematical lines in the air dissolving into motes of silver dust. The silver-cloaked speaker’s eyes lose their hard edge, and she folds her arms, listening.  

In that hush, I realize the pearl’s glow has brightened, bathing us all in warm light. I stand taller. In my dream, I have found my voice—and with it, the courage to reshape the fate of the world around me.
