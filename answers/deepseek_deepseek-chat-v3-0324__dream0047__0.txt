I am dreaming. The sky above is a bruised violet, streaked with molten gold where the last embers of sunset cling to the horizon. The air hums with a strange electricity, thick with the scent of ozone and something metallic—blood or rust, I can’t tell. Around me, people scream, their voices ragged with terror, their footsteps pounding against the cracked earth like desperate drums. Something enormous has happened. A rupture. A collapse. The ground beneath us trembles as if the world itself is groaning in pain.  

A building—no, not just a building, something grander, a tower or a monument—crumples inward like a dying star, its once-proud structure folding into itself in slow, shuddering increments. Dust plumes rise in great blooming mushrooms, swallowing the wounded sky. People around me are on their knees, weeping, clutching their heads as though the weight of the tragedy might crush them entirely. A woman nearby reaches out to the collapsing ruin, her fingers splayed, her mouth open in a soundless wail. A child tugs at her sleeve, confused, eyes wide with uncomprehending fear.  

And yet—  

I stand perfectly still.  

The chaos rolls over me like a wave breaking against stone. I feel it—oh, I *feel* it—the grief, the terror, the finality of it all humming through my bones. But deeper, beneath the horror, there is something else. A stillness. A clarity. The world is ending, and in its ending, I see with impossible sharpness: the fractal splinters of glass suspended in midair, the veins in the leaves of a trembling sapling nearby, the way the dust motes catch the fading light like dying fireflies.  

The others weep, but my eyes are dry. My heartbeat is steady. I feel no urge to run, no urge to collapse—only to *see*. To witness. As if some dormant part of me has awoken, something older than sorrow, older than fear. A voice—mine, or perhaps not mine—whispers in the caverns of my mind:  

*Oh. I remember now.*  

And in that moment, the dream shivers. The sky splits open. The falling tower halts in its descent. The world is caught between breath and breath. And I realize—  

This is not the first time I have watched an ending.  

(And it will not be the last.)
