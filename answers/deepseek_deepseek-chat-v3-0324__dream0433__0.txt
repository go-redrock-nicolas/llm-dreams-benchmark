I am dreaming. **The Dreamscape Unveils:**

The air around me is thick with the scent of damp earth and crushed lavender, a perfume both soothing and haunting. I find myself standing in a vast hall of mirrors—endless, shifting reflections stretching into infinity, their surfaces rippling like liquid silver. Each mirror does not show my face, but rather the faces of others—strangers, friends, lovers—all frozen in expressions of quiet judgment. Their eyes bore into me, not with malice, but with a knowing intensity that makes my chest tighten.  

Then, the realization strikes like a lightning bolt: *Their disapproval is mine.*  

One mirror—larger than the rest—pulsates with a dark, oily swirl. Drawn to it, I press my palm against the glass, and it gives way like water. The reflection shifts, warps, and suddenly *I* am staring back at myself, but not as I know me. This version of me is sneering, arms crossed, eyes narrowed—mocking, critical, full of quiet disdain. Hot shame coils in my gut. *This is how I look when I judge others.*  

The surrounding whispers swell—not in words, but in *echoes* of thoughts I’ve had before:  
*"They’re so selfish."* (But am I not selfish too?)  
*"They never listen."* (When have I refused to hear?)  

The accusing faces in the mirrors begin to weep silver tears, their expressions softening into sorrow. The glass trembles; cracks spiderweb across the surface. My reflection reaches out—not to blame, but to *take my hand.*  

And just as our fingers touch—  

**I wake.**  

The weight of the dream lingers, an aftertaste of raw truth: *The harshest judgments we cast are often the ones we’ve already leveled at ourselves.*
