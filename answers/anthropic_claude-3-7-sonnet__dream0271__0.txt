I am dreaming. I approach a towering lighthouse perched on a cliff that shouldn't exist—jagged obsidian rock impossibly suspended over an ocean that shifts between midnight blue and molten silver. The lighthouse beam doesn't sweep in circles but fragments into thousands of tiny stars that rain down around me, each containing a memory of something I've sacrificed to reach this point.

Years of missed birthdays flutter past like moth wings. Relationships grown cold from neglect crystallize into delicate ice sculptures that melt against my fingertips. The hollow ache of exhaustion that became so familiar I stopped noticing it now pulses with each heartbeat.

The lighthouse door is weathered copper, engraved with symbols that rearrange themselves when I try to focus—sometimes appearing as words in languages I almost understand, sometimes as faces of people who believed in me when I couldn't believe in myself.

As I reach for the handle, the air thickens with possibility. The door is simultaneously impossibly heavy and weightless. I feel the presence of everyone who told me this couldn't be done standing behind me, their doubts tangible as breath on my neck, while ahead waits everything I've ever wanted.

My hand trembles. The metal is warm against my palm—alive somehow. The door swings open not to reveal a room but a vast, impossible landscape where the sky and ground have exchanged places. My achievement isn't an object or accolade but a doorway to something I never imagined possible.

I step through, understanding that reaching my goal isn't an ending but a transformation, and I am becoming something entirely new.
