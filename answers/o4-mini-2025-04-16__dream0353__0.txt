I am dreaming.  
You drift through a lavender sky streaked with molten gold, each breath tasting like warm rain on sunbaked stone. Floating islands of crystalline lotus flowers drift past, their petals humming in soft half-heard melodies. As you glide between them, a procession of hooded figures in robes spun from midnight and starlight greets you, extending hands made not of flesh but of living light.  

They beckon you into a circle of polished obsidian that reflects the universe back at itself. There, a single crystal chalice levitates above a pedestal carved with ancient sigils. One of the figures tilts it toward you, and the chalice overflows with a silver mist that fills your lungs and seems to stir something buried deep in your chest—a memory of a place you’ve never been, of a voice that’s always whispered at the edge of your mind.  

Exploring this unexpected connection, you find yourself mirroring the hooded guide’s movements. Slow, deliberate gestures: outstretched arms tracing the symbol of an inverted tree; fingertips dancing along invisible ley lines with every exhale. The light-beings join you in a soft chorus, voices weaving through your ribcage, unlocking a resonance so profound it feels as if every cell in your body has become a tiny harp, vibrating in unison.  

Suddenly the moon above shatters into thousands of pearlescent shards that swirl around you like petals in a storm. Each fragment carries a fleeting vision—ancient temples hidden beneath jungle canopies, monastic circles chanting by torchlight, a solitary monk seated in perfect stillness at the heart of a mountain cave. You realize this practice is older than memory itself, a river of knowing that has found its way into your veins.  

When dawn finally ripples at the edge of your dreamscape, the hooded figures bow and vanish into the cosmos. You awaken with your fingertips tingling, your heartbeat echoing in the quiet room. Even now, when you close your eyes, the hum of that lotus-flower melody lingers, and you know that the door to that hidden temple stands slightly ajar within you—waiting for your return.
