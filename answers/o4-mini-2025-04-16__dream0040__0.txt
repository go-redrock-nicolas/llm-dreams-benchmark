I am dreaming. You close your eyes—and suddenly you’re standing at the edge of a track that seems to stretch beyond the horizon, its lanes glowing in shifting colors of dawn and dusk. The air vibrates with a low humming—like millions of voices chanting your name in harmonies you can’t quite decipher. You feel the rough ridge of the starting line beneath your spike-clad toes; each grain of rubber pulses with expectation. Above you, the stadium is both colossal and intimate: its arches ripple like silk, and the stands shimmer with faceless spectators whose cheers feel warm, almost tactile, against your skin.

Your heart drips adrenaline into your veins. You sense the ozone tang of electricity as storm-like clouds swirl overhead—yet a shaft of golden sunlight breaks through, illuminating the track before you. With each breath, you taste the metallic sweet edge of victory so close you can almost touch it. You glance down and see your body glowing from within: muscles knotted and honed by a lifetime of training, sinew aglow like coiled springs of raw power. You inhale, and the world slows—time ripples outward in waves, offering you a single perfect moment to gather every fragment of focus.

Then the starting horn cracks—a blossom of light that pulses through your entire being. You explode forward. The track beneath your feet unfolds like a living ribbon, bending and winding to guide your stride. Wind roars in your ears, but above it you hear your coach’s distant voice, unwavering: “Now!” You surge, limbs pumping with effortless grace, eyes locked on the shimmering finish. Each step feels eternal, as if you’re running not just toward a line but through realms of possibility. The stadium’s dome peels away and you’re racing across a sky-bound bridge, clouds parting to reveal a galaxy of stars cheering you onward.

In the final meters, the ribbon of light at the end of the track stretches toward you like a lover’s arms. You summon the last reserves of your spirit—an electric current that crackles through your fingertips, illuminating the lane in blinding white. And then you’ve crossed: time snaps back. The world surges with color and sound. The crowd breaks into a roar that feels like the heartbeat of the entire earth. A gold medal—wrought from starlight and molten triumph—descends to rest against your chest, its warmth seeping into every cell of your being. In that vivid instant before you awaken, you know you have become legend: an eternal flicker of glory dancing at the edge of dream and dawn.
