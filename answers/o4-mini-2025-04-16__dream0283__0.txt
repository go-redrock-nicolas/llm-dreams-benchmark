I am dreaming. You drift through a landscape woven from moonlight and memory: the sky above is a pale teal, shot through with rivers of mercury that flow like liquid time. Each breath you take tastes of lavender and rain-washed stone. Trees with opalescent bark lean in close, their branches dripping with crystalline tears that chime like tiny bells whenever a gust of wind stirs the air. Beneath your feet, the ground pulses softly, as though the world itself were breathing in harmony with your own heart.

Then, at the edge of a mirrored lake, you see them—your closest confidant—reflected perfectly back at you. Their eyes glint with something like apology, but their lips curl away. You realize, in that instant, that every promise you believed in was spun from smoke and shadows. The weight of betrayal settles in your chest like lead, and the trees hush; even the chime of their tears goes silent. The mercury rivers halt their flow, freezing in midstream. You feel the world contracting, narrowing to the single, sharp truth that you have been deceived.

Processing the revelation, your emotions split into a kaleidoscope of fire and ice. Rage flares like a sunburst behind your ribs—hot, bright, demanding release—but alongside it a sorrow as deep as the lake’s mirrored depths seeps in. You clench your fists and the air around you curls into storm clouds, thunder rolling like the echo of broken trust. Yet as the first raindrops fall—each a tiny promise of cleansing—you sense something stirring within: the fragile seed of understanding that even deceit can teach. The mercury rivers begin to flow again, this time guiding you away from the lake’s edge. With every step, the ground’s pulse steadies, echoing a newfound resolve. In this dreamscape of light and shadow, you gather the fragments of your wounded trust and shape them into something stronger: a resolve to stand clear-eyed, no longer hostage to illusions, and to walk forward into whatever dawn lies ahead.
