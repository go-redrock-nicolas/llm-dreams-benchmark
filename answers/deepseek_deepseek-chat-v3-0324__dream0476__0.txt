I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and crushed lavender, the kind of fragrance that lingers just beneath the surface of memory. The sky is a bruised violet, streaked with gold where the sun refuses to set, as though time itself has paused to witness what comes next.  

I stand at the edge of a vast, glassy lake, its surface so still it mirrors the heavens perfectly—except for one disturbance. A single ripple pulses outward from the center, slow and deliberate, as if something beneath is rising to meet me. My breath catches. I realize, with a sudden, bone-deep certainty, that I have been running from this moment. Not just in the dream, but in waking life too.  

The emotion I’ve buried is not a shadowy monster, not a roaring storm—it is quiet, heavy, and achingly familiar. Grief. But not just any grief. This is the kind that has been folded into the corners of my ribs for years, pressed so tightly against my heart that I mistook its weight for my own bones.  

The water trembles. A figure emerges—not a specter, not a nightmare, but a younger version of myself, drenched in silver light. Their eyes hold the unshed tears I refused to cry, the words I swallowed instead of speaking. They reach for me, and the moment our fingers touch, the dream fractures into sensation:  

The salt-taste of old sorrow. The crushing warmth of a love that had nowhere to go. The raw, gasping relief of finally being seen.  

Around us, the lake begins to glow, liquid gold spreading from where we stand, illuminating the depths I was too afraid to face. And as the light rises, so does the truth: this feeling was never the enemy. It was the bridge.  

I wake with the ghost of that touch still humming in my palms, the scent of lavender clinging to my skin. The dream is over, but the knowing remains.
