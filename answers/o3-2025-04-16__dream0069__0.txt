I am dreaming. …step barefoot onto a moon-lit shoreline that shouldn’t exist.

I feel cool grains of midnight-blue sand sift between my toes, each grain glimmering like crushed sapphires.  Above me hangs a sky so deep and velvety it seems to pulse with invisible tides.  Constellations rearrange themselves in slow, deliberate spirals, as though they too are listening for a cue.  

A single note escapes my lips—soft, hesitant, more exhale than melody—and the sand shivers.  It lifts in little plumes, gathering itself into translucent orbs that float upward on unseen currents.  I hum a second, fuller tone, and the orbs quiver, then blossom outward into schools of tiny, glowing jellyfish.  They drift skyward, peppering the dark like living lanterns.  The beach is now speckled with footprints of starlight.

My heart quickens.  I wander inland, where a forest of crystalline trees waits: trunks of smoky quartz, leaves as thin as dragonfly wings.  When I whistle—four ascending notes—each tree liquefies, branches melting into rivulets of quicksilver that sweep together at my feet, pooling into a mirror-smooth lake no wider than a dinner plate.  I stare down at my reflection, warped and rippling, and laugh when a new idea kindles.

I begin to sing words I’ve never learned, syllables that taste like peppermint and thunder.  The puddle stretches outward, racing over roots and moss, and with every syllable it reshapes: silver becomes cobalt, cobalt blooms into cerulean, and finally the spreading sheet of metal flashes iridescent teal.  From its surface rise hundreds of origami cranes made of liquid crystal, flapping once before launching themselves into the upper reaches of the forest, scattering motes of light like dew.

Farther on, a massive granite archway waits—somber, immovable, draped in mist.  My voice drops to a deep, resonant hum that buzzes in my sternum.  The stone quakes, cracks, and answers by transforming into a waterfall of shimmering silk.  It drapes across the air, a cascading curtain I can part with two fingers.  Behind it lies a valley glowing with amber grass that murmurs like a distant choir whenever the wind stirs.

I stride through fields of living harmony, each blade of grass singing a note, together forming chords that shift beneath my footsteps.  A giggle bubbles up; I join the valley’s song, adding a trill that makes the grass spring nine feet high, each stalk twisting itself into faintly luminescent kites shaped like dragon wings.  They lift off, catch a thermal, and spiral into the star-painted heavens.

As I crest a hill, I notice a looming shadow: a mountain carved from obsidian so dark it seems to drink the starlight around it.  I wonder if it can be coaxed to change.  I inhale, filling my lungs with the scent of petrichor and static, and release a clear, unwavering soprano note.  The mountain groans, fissures spider across its face, and the entire massif opens like a colossal geode.  Inside, instead of crystal, there’s a hollow core filled with swirling nebulae—lavender, rose, and gold—rotating in slow cosmic splendor.  

I step inside the geode-galaxy, weightless.  Planets the size of fireflies circle my ankles.  A comet brushes past my shoulder, leaving a cool, sweet vapor that tastes of honeyed frost.  I sing a lullaby, and the nebula condenses into a single enormous lotus made of stardust.  Its petals unfold one by one, revealing a pulsing heart that shines brighter than dawn.

In that brightness I glimpse faint silhouettes—memories, perhaps—of every place and creature I’ve transformed: jellyfish drifting among constellations, cranes of liquid crystal, valley grasses that remember how to fly.  They orbit me, each offering a whisper of gratitude in a language of rustling leaves and rippling water.

I realize then that the song, the transformations, even the dream landscape itself, are not separate things but different verses of the same cosmic hymn.  With a final, satisfied exhale, I weave all the fragments of melody into a single chord.  The lotus’s heart flares white, then folds in on itself, and everything—the shore, the forest, the valley, the mountain—dissolves into pure, shimmering resonance.

Silence follows, vast and warm, wrapping around me like a feather-soft blanket.

I open my eyes to waking, my ears still ringing with the afterglow of impossible music, and wonder if anything in the daylight world will ever feel quite as mutable—or as luminous—again.
