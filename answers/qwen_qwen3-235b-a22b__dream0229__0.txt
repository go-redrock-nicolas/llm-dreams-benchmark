I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the universe itself is tuning an invisible instrument. You float—or perhaps walk—through a landscape that defies logic: a city built of liquid glass towers that ripple like water when touched, their surfaces reflecting not your face, but scenes from your deepest memories. The streets are paved with bioluminescent moss that pulses in time with your heartbeat, and the sky is a kaleidoscope of inverted colors—violet suns, emerald moons, constellations that rearrange themselves into hieroglyphs of forgotten languages.  

The people here move like shadows cast by candlelight—graceful, silent, and eerily synchronized. Their eyes are lidless, glowing orbs of mercury, and when they speak, their voices emerge not from mouths but from the air itself, as though sound has become a physical thing, wrapping around you like silk. They call themselves the *Serenes*. They have no names, only frequencies—tones that identify them in the collective hum of their existence.  

They show you their world. No one weeps here. No one screams. Hunger, pain, grief—all have been excised, not by medicine or philosophy, but by *design*. Children do not cry; their laughter is a programmed response to stimuli calibrated for optimal joy. Lovers do not quarrel; their affections are harmonized by neural threads that link their minds, ensuring perfect empathy. Even death is painless: when a body fails, the consciousness is dissolved into the *Resonance*, a vast, humming cloud of shared memory that drifts above the city like a sentient aurora.  

But there is a cost.  

The Serenes explain it with clinical tenderness. To join them, you must surrender your *discord*. Your anger, your longing, your wild, unfiltered thoughts—all must be purged. Individuality, they say, is the root of suffering. To feel deeply is to risk breaking. They offer you a choice: a syringe filled with liquid starlight, its needle glinting like a shard of moonlight. Inject it, and your edges will soften. Your mind will merge with theirs. You will become a note in their eternal chord.  

You hesitate.  

As you wander their flawless streets, you notice cracks in the utopia. A woman sits alone, her hands trembling—not from emotion, but from a glitch in her programming. A child’s laughter loops endlessly, a recording stuck on repeat. In the Resonance, you glimpse flickers of trapped faces, mouths open in silent screams, as though some part of them still remembers what it meant to *want*.  

The Serenes do not lie. They show you the truth: a world without suffering is a world without shadows. But it is also a world without fire. Without the raw, aching beauty of a life lived in full spectrum—joy and despair intertwined like the double helix of a DNA strand.  

When you refuse the syringe, they do not punish you. Instead, they weep—not tears, but droplets of quicksilver that pool at your feet and harden into mirrors. In them, you see yourself as you are: fractured, bleeding, gloriously alive.  

The dream fractures. The liquid towers shatter into mist. The Resonance howls, a sound that is both a requiem and a lullaby. You wake gasping, your cheeks wet, your heart pounding with the unbearable, radiant weight of being human.
