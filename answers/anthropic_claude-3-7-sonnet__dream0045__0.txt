I am dreaming. I stand amid the skeletal remains of what was once my home, the foundation cracked like ancient pottery, walls reduced to scattered piles of brick and splintered wood. The air hangs heavy with the metallic scent of rain-soaked debris and the earthy perfume of upturned soil. Above me, the sky stretches in an impossible shade of lavender-gray, clouds moving with unnatural speed as if time itself has been disrupted.

Where my garden once flourished now lies a strange, glistening depression filled with water that reflects nothing—not the sky, not my face when I peer into it. The disaster came without warning—a great shaking that opened the earth, followed by waters rising from places waters shouldn't be, defying logic and gravity alike.

I walk through what was once my living room, and strangely, certain objects remain untouched amid the devastation—my grandmother's music box sits perfectly intact on a piece of floating debris, playing a melody I've never heard before though I've wound it a thousand times.

In the distance, other survivors move like ghosts through the ruins of our community, but when I call to them, my voice produces no sound. Yet somehow, they turn toward me with expressions of recognition and their eyes—their eyes glow with a soft blue luminescence.

As I navigate the destruction, I realize the landscape is slowly transforming. From the broken earth, crystalline structures begin to grow—translucent, catching light in rainbow prisms, forming new architectural shapes unlike anything human-designed. The community is rebuilding itself, but into something extraordinary and unknown, something both terrifying and breathtakingly beautiful.

And I understand, with that peculiar dream-certainty, that this isn't an ending at all—it's a metamorphosis.
