I am dreaming. You drift into a moonlit forest where the trees hum with phosphorescent green light and the air tastes of lavender and rain. Your footsteps make no sound on the velvet moss, yet each step vibrates in your bones. Above you, a giant origami moon unfolds, casting glimmering paper cranes that flutter through the branches. As you follow their silent dance, you feel both weightless and utterly grounded, as though nature itself is cradling you in its breath.

Ahead, a river of molten silver winds between glowing ferns. You lean over the bank, cupping the liquid in your hand—and instead of water, it tastes faintly of caramel and warmed almonds. Confused, you discover that the river is formed from the very capsules of single-serve coffee pods you’ve used this week. Each discarded capsule you tossed in the trash in waking life has somehow found its way here, melting into this luminous current. The river churns with labels and logos you recognize—your favorite morning ritual, now a winding stream of plastic and foil. A gentle whisper rides the current: “Every choice lives on.”

You reach into the stream and pull out a pod, watching it crack open in your palm. Inside, a tiny coral reef writhes, bright pink polyps coughing out wisps of smoke. In the distance you hear the reef’s cry: “We suffocate.” Your chest tightens. You remember how easy it is to swipe a credit card for convenience: a fresh cup in seconds, no cleanup, no thought. And now, in this dream, the cost of comfort blooms before you in choking coral and a river of refuse.

Heart pounding, you step back, and the forest around you shifts. The origami moon tears itself apart, each paper panel turning into a disposable coffee cup that floats by like a silent specter. Trees bend to whisper stories of ruined coastlines and islanded plastics, their voices trembling like wind through autumn leaves. The sensation is overwhelming—a surreal mirror held to your daily routine.

Suddenly, you stand on a deserted beach of crushed pods and melted foil, the tide of new capsules rising behind you. Sand beneath your feet is barnacled plastic, sharp and jagged. You stumble, then straighten, determination flooding in. In the distance, a single paper crane alights on your shoulder—a fragile emblem of hope. You understand that in waking life, each small choice ripples outward. You can keep surrendering to convenience, or you can find alternatives: reusable filters, returned capsules, compostable grounds.

The crane’s wing brushes your cheek, and you feel a spark of resolve. You raise your hand, and the crane transforms into a tiny seedling—green, pulsing with life. In that moment, you decide: tomorrow, you’ll swap habits. You’ll trade single-use ease for lasting care. As that vow settles in your bones, the factory of discarded pods dissolves, the forest brightens, and the silver river runs clear once more—this time, of pure, living water. You wake with your heart still soaring, a whisper in your mind urging you onward: “Every choice lives on.”
