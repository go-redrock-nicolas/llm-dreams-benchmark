I am dreaming. You are dreaming. Above you, the sky ripples like liquid opal, waves of teal and rose drifting across an endless horizon. Beneath your feet, the earth feels soft and warm, as if padded with moss spun from starlight. Every breath you draw tastes of moonlit jasmine, and in the distance a chorus of bell-crickets hums a melody that seems to know your name.

As you step forward, a gentle wind carries wisps of words—half-formed sentences, echoing thoughts that hover at the edge of your awareness. You recognize them: those rushing phrases you tend to speak the moment your heart quickens. In this dream-scape, they swirl as glowing motes, like fireflies of impulse buzzing around you. You feel the familiar flutter of emotion—excitement, fear, longing—igniting those motes into bright sparks.

Practicing more intentional communication, you pause. You raise your hand and summon a bubble of silence that blooms around you, translucent and humming with possibility. Inside this bubble, time slows: you see each spark of impulse suspended like a dewdrop, each word a seed waiting to be chosen. You inhale the jasmine air, steadying your pulse, and in that stillness you gather your thoughts as a gardener gathers petals, arranging them deliberately into a blossom.

When you speak at last, your voice is a soft but confident bell. The chosen words drift outward and, upon touching the world, transform it: the moss underfoot blooms into glowing lilies that trace your path; the bell-crickets’ song rearranges itself into harmonious verses. Each word you release ripples through the dream, painting constellations on the sky, carving doorways of light in distant mountains.

You continue onward, guided by the trail of illuminated lily-pads, carrying your bubble of silence with you. Whenever a new surge of feeling stirs—like a sudden gust scattering shimmering petals—you return to that gentle hush. You recall each spark, each word-seed, and decide whether to plant it, reshape it, or let it drift away.

At the heart of the landscape stands a great crystal fountain, its waters singing of clarity and connection. You lean in, and as you drink, you feel the practice of intentional speech becoming part of you, interwoven with your very breath. The dream’s colors deepen, the music swells, and in that radiant stillness you realize: words spoken with care can illuminate entire worlds.

Then, as all dreams do, this one begins to dissolve in a cascade of light. You awake with the echo of that fountain’s song in your chest, carrying with you the gift of thoughtful speech—a gentle power you can summon, pause by pause, word by word.
