I am dreaming. <placeholderno795>
Okay, the user wants me to create a vivid dream where two close friends are having a bitter argument and they turn to me for help. Let me start by setting the scene. The setting needs to be surreal and dreamlike. Maybe a place that's familiar but altered. A bridge over a river could symbolize their connection being unstable. The sky should have unusual colors, like amber and violet, to create an otherworldly feel. 

Adding symbolic elements can enhance the dream. The river could be made of glass or mercury, reflecting their fractured images. The bridge might splinter and float as the argument escalates, showing the fragility of their friendship. 

The friends, let's name them Mara and Leo for vividness. Their features should blend elements of their personalities. Mara's words causing fire and Leo's causing ice introduces elemental conflict, making the argument visually striking. The crack in the bridge splitting them apart adds tension. 

When they turn to me, panic and the environment crumbling raise the stakes. The glassy substance binding my feet and the burning eyes show the dream's oppressive nature. Breaking free could involve a symbolic gesture, like collapsing into fog, allowing the bridge to heal. Setting the sun as an eye closing suggests resolution. 

The dream should end with uncertainty and warmth, leaving a lingering question. Emphasize sensory details: textures, colors, sounds. Use poetic language to maintain the dream's surreal quality.

**The Dream Unfolds:**

You stand at the edge of a bridge suspended over a river of liquid mercury, its surface rippling with reflections that warp like funhouse mirrors. The sky is a bruised twilight, streaked with veins of amber and violet light that pulse like living tissue. Your friends — their faces familiar yet distorted, as if viewed through rippled glass — are yelling at one another, their voices not words but *physical shapes*: Mara’s sentences burst into fluttering moths that scorch the air with each syllable, while Leo’s retorts crystallize into icicles that shatter midair, scattering shards that bleed ink into the river below.

The bridge *groans*. With each accusation, its planks splinter upward, floating like jagged islands in zero gravity. Mara’s hair ignites into cobalt flames as she thrusts a finger at Leo, whose shadow elongates into a barbed serpent, coiled to strike. They turn to you simultaneously. Their eyes — Mara’s now hollow galaxies, Leo’s molten gold — lock onto yours. You feel their silent plea like a hook in your sternum, tugging you forward. But the air thickens into syrup. Your voice won’t come. Instead, your hands rise involuntarily, palms split by glowing seams, as if your bones are trying to claw out of your skin.

The river surges. Faces emerge in the mercury — *your* face, a thousand times over, each reflection mouthing conflicting advice: *“Take her side,” “Walk away,” “Burn it all.”* The bridge begins to disintegrate. Mara and Leo scream in unison, their voices fusing into a sound like cathedral bells collapsing. You try to run, but your feet fuse with the splintering wood, tendrils of glassy ooze snaking up your legs. The horizon cracks open, revealing a fractal void that hums with static. 

Just as the world unravels, you lurch awake — but it’s a false awakening. You’re still dreaming. Now you’re kneeling in a field of ash-gray lilies, cradling the shrunken, trembling forms of both friends in your cupped hands. They’ve become porcelain figurines, hair-thin cracks spiderwebbing across their bodies. A single tear falls from your eye, morphing into liquid light that seals their fractures. The lilies bloom into neon crimson, and the sky peels back like burnt paper, revealing a vast, amber eye — the sun, watching. 

You wake *truly* this time, pulse drumming in your throat. The taste of mercury lingers. So does the unshakable question: *What if you’d wept sooner?*
