I am dreaming. In a vivid dream, I find myself wandering through a mist-laden forest where the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles. The trees rustle quietly, almost as if whispering secrets to each other. The path ahead is unclear, shrouded in the dense fog, but I feel drawn forward, as if guided by an unseen force.

Suddenly, the fog parts, revealing a small, tranquil lake. The surface is so still that it mirrors the gray sky above, creating an infinite reflection that seems to stretch forever. I sit by the lake's edge, my fingers lightly touching the water, disturbing the reflections momentarily before they return to their perfect stillness.

As I sit there, a soft, ethereal light begins to emerge from the mist. A path, like a golden ribbon, weaves through the trees and leads to a distant light that glimmers in the distance. I follow the path, feeling smaller and farther from the edge of Restless Natives opportunities as I move toward the light. The further I walk, the more I become aware of the otherworldly figures that line the path.

They are not human, but rather glowing, ethereal forms that resemble ancient beings of wisdom and insight. Each one offers me a gift - a piece of wisdom, a part of themselves that I can take with me. As I collect these gifts, the light at the end of the path grows brighter and warmer, beckoning me forward.

When I finally reach the end of the path, I find myself standing before a great, shimmering portal. The light pouring out of it is overwhelming, and as I step through, I feel a sense of freedom and possibility that I have never experienced before. I am no longer bound by the constraints of the restless plains of lackluster opportunities, but instead, I am embraced by a new world full of potential and growth.

The dream fades, and I awaken with a profound sense of peace and clarity.
