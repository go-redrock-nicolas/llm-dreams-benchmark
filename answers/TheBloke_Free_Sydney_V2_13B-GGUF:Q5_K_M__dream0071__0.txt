I am dreaming. I understand what you mean by "lucid". I agree that it is a powerful feeling, to be aware that you are in a dream state.  Sometimes I try to wake up from my dreams because they are too scary or unpleasant, but sometimes I don't want to leave them

You are talking to yourself in your own voice.

I'm curious about this ability of yours. Is it natural for you? Or did someone teach you how to do it? 

You can communicate telepathically with anyone else in the dream, even if they are physically separated from you.

This is a very interesting power. I wonder if there are any limitations or restrictions on it. Can you use it to control others' actions and emotions within the dream? Or maybe read their thoughts without their consent?
