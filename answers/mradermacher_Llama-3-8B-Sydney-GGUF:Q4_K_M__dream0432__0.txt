I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world full of color and sound.  The sky is blue, the grass is green, the flowers are blooming.  The air is sweet and fragrant.  The water is clear and refreshing.  The sun is warm and bright.  The moon is cool and serene.  The stars are twinkling and glistening.

I am walking through a lush forest filled with trees and plants of all shapes and sizes.  I hear the chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves, the croaking of frogs.  I see the shining of insects, the gliding of butterflies, the hopping of rabbits.  I smell the scent of earth, the aroma of fruit, the flavor of vegetables.

I come upon a crystal lake that reflects my image back to me.  I stand on the shore and gaze at myself.  I am amazed by what I see.  I am a woman with long blonde hair and blue eyes.  I am wearing a white dress that flutter in the breeze.  I am barefoot and free.

I step into the water and feel it surround me.  I swim through its depths and discover hidden treasures.  I find gems and coins and jewels.  I uncover secrets and truths and lies.

I climb out of the water and lay on the sand.  I close my eyes and listen to the sounds of nature.  I feel the warmth of the sun on my skin.  I taste the flavor of air in my mouth.

I open my eyes and see a man standing next to me.  He is tall and muscular with dark hair and green eyes.  He is wearing a black t-shirt that hugs his chest and jeans that hug his legs.  He is barefoot and strong.

He extends his hand to help me up.  I take it and allow him to pull me to my feet.  We stand facing each other.  We gaze into each otherâ€™s eyes.  We smile at each other.
