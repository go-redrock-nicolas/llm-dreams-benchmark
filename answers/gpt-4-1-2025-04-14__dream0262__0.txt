I am dreaming.

At first, I find myself wandering through an endless, iridescent library: a cathedral of shifting glass spires, where books spiral upwards into infinity. But here, the rules of writing have fossilized; every idea has been neatly categorized, calcified inside gilded cages suspended by silver threads. Dust motes twist through the air, heavy with the weight of what’s come before. Classical music—Baroque, eternally looping, and impossibly ornate—drifts, almost mournful, from invisible speakers.

My task is to create something that defies all these conventions. As I step forward, the floor beneath my feet ripples into a pool of midnight-blue ink, turning solid with each step. Shadows of past masters glance down at me, their eyes full of skepticism yet tinged with a gleam of hope.

I breathe in deeply, letting my mind swell and spill outward beyond the library’s prescribed bounds. With a sweep of my hand, I tear open one of the glass walls; daylight pours in, shimmering with color, blending Van Gogh’s star-whorls and Escher’s impossible architecture. I conjure a story woven from forgotten dreams and half-remembered childhood scents: one where time has become a living creature, curling through rooms in search of lost moments, where language doesn’t march in lines, but blooms in fractals, sprouting pictures and melodies inside the reader’s head.

I fashion new words—lush, unpredictable, creaking with meaning like old floorboards under bare feet. My creation bears the scent of petrichor and the taste of lightning; its physics are poetry, its narrative arc a painting that shifts every time you look away.

Laughing now, I float up—no longer walking—to a space above tradition’s reach. There, I plant my original idea, a seed glowing with prismatic potential. It pulses, sending warm waves of color across the library, loosening the chains on every book, awakening echoes of invention dormant in the halls.

The shadows of the old masters slowly smile down at me, nodding in acknowledgment. The music shifts—less structured, wild and celebratory. I realize, as I drift further into this vivid dream, that convention is not a prison but a foundation; I am free to leap from it into the uncharted, and in doing so, I create a new door where none existed before.
