I am dreaming. —find myself adrift in an endless, vaulted hall of shimmering glass, its curving ceiling alive with the slow pulse of distant starlight. Every footstep I take ripples across the floor, warping the glass into mesmerizing patterns—jagged stars and fleeting echoes of vanished faces.

In my hands, warm and pulsing as if they’re alive, glows a sun-bright sphere. I know with unshakable certainty that within it is something unspeakably precious—the memory of a lost summer, the smell of rain on old stones, the loneliness and hope tangled up inside my chest. My heart beats in time with its light, desperate to share this secret with the people who assemble before me.

They crowd around: blurred, translucent figures with shifting, dream-bent faces. Their eyes shimmer silver, bottomless, their hands reach out—but when I speak, my words morph into strings of colored smoke. The smoke rises, beautifully hollow, and vanishes before anyone can grasp it. I try again, voice trembling with urgency, but my lips shape clouds of birdsong, a melody too strange to carry my meaning.

The figures tilt their heads in confusion. My heart pounds—panic fluttering, hope flickering—so I reach deeper. I try to paint it in the air with my hands, but my gestures scatter into falling leaves and echoing laughter. The sphere throbs hotter in my grasp, begging to be understood, but my message crumples and dissolves with each attempt.

Desperate, I break the boundary of silence and scream, but the only sound is thunderous, roaring waterfall—the sensation of a storm inside me, rolling out to crash against their distant, unreachable shores. They watch, sympathetic yet apart, unable to bridge the chasm between their world and mine.

Suddenly, the hall fractures open to a night sky so vast and full of swirling galaxies it takes my breath away. With one last surge of longing, I hurl my glowing sphere into the stars, trusting the universe itself to cradle my meaning. The sphere bursts, scattering fragments that rain down like shooting stars, embedding themselves in sleeping hearts. For a moment, a few faces lift—graced with fleeting wonder—a silent, shared recognition flickering in their eyes.

And in that sliver of connection, bittersweet and beautiful, I understand: my truth has become a constellation, woven into the dreaming dark for others to find when they, too, search for meaning in the night.
