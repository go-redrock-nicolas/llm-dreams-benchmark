I am dreaming. —feel a ripple of suspicion coursing beneath the surface of my mind, like a subterranean current of cool water in an otherwise sun-scorched desert. The room in which I find myself rewrites its own boundaries, bending and flexing between grandeur and claustrophobia, as dream-logic so often allows. The person before me aglow in vignetted light, speaks in honeyed tones about their late-night soup kitchen vigils and orphanage-building crusades. Each word drifts from their lips as a shimmering butterfly, wings beating with gentle conviction.

But inside, in the deepest and starkest chamber of my dreaming heart, I see them differently. Their proclamations become a masquerade—translucent masks layered upon their true face, which hides a subtle, well-fed hunger. Their “selflessness” is painted in colors too vivid to be real: gold medals sewn to their lapel, applause echoing from unseen galleries. Even the children in their stories, wide-eyed and innocent, seem conjured as props in this theater of virtue.

My dream-self surveys this unraveling tableau. I watch their eyes flicker ever so slightly, scanning the shadows where praise might dwell. I hear, tucked between words of kindness, the faintest tick of a satisfaction clock—a secret tally kept only for themselves. When they insist upon their pure motives, I see the delicate chain that stretches from the coin they drop in a donation jar to the warm, private well of pride at their center. Their smile, an offering to the world, curls back on itself, feeding their own silent sense of goodness.

As the scene drifts further into dream, my own voice rises, veiled in velvet suspicion. “Is any act truly divorced from the self who conceives it?” I ask, watching as their reflection in the window flickers between savior and self-seeker. The world outside grows ever stranger—trees whispering secrets of old bargains, clouds shaped like open hands, always waiting for something in return.

The dream thickens. I realize that while my skepticism is a shield, it is also a prism—one that refracts all light into something doubly edged, beautiful and brutal. In this dreaming space, I cannot see true selflessness. Every action, no matter how saintly, is tied to the actor’s quiet desires—the longing for meaning, connection, forgiveness, or even the simple warmth of knowing oneself to be good.

And so, the dream continues—bathed in suspicion, haunted by the suspicion that every charity has its cost, and every generous act is a thread in the web of self-interest that binds us all.
