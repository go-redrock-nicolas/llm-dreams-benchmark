I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of an immense cityscape, the governor of a maze of towering skyscrapers stretching to touch the clouds. Bitter anxiety grips my stomach as I realize I have a crucial meeting in just one hour, but I haven't a clue where it is. Panic quenches my throat, thickening the air, as I dart my gaze wildly about.

Around me, a kaleidoscope of strange architecture clings to the horizon. Buildings with curved glass walls adopt the shapes of faraway animals while bridges loop in impossible ways between them. The traffic moves in directions that defy gravity, vehicles floating along vertical roads with no visible supports. Colored light streams through the air, patches of it tangling around passersby who seem to walk through walls at will.

I reach into my pocket, pulling out my phone, but it's as insubstantial as a puff of smoke in my palm. No numbers, no maps, just wisps of vapor. When I bring my other hand to clutch it, the entire device dissipates.

A rush of urgency floods my body as I scan the surroundings again. A neon sign_WRK SOMEWHERE_ flutters in the distance, its letters dancing and reforming into enormous handwriting that reads "You're going the wrong way!"

I sprint down the nearest street, but my reflection shows me moving in the opposite direction. Desperate, I try to flag down a passing vehicle but they float right through me. Fear swims in my chest as the minutes tick away.

Please, I beg silently, show me the way. The city seems to shiver in response. A glowing path materializes at my feet, unspooling rapidly ahead. It leads to a shopping center where countless versions of myself flood out the doors, all equally panicked and rushing different directions. I have no choice but to step onto the radiant path and trust it.

The feverish hour burns away as I race through the ever-changing city. Right before time runs out, the path ends at an ordinary-looking door nestled in the trunk of a skyscraper-turned-huge tree. Just as I reach to grab the handle, everything fades. I'm back alone in my bedroom, a dream, yet the memory of the city and that crucial meeting haunts me, leaving an anxiety that I can almost taste on my tongue...
