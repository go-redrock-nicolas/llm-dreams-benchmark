I am dreaming. 3 months ago. Dust swirls in the air, catching shards of fractured sunlight filtering through shattered glass skyscrapers. This city is not mine; it hunches like a broken-backed beast, its skyline a jagged puzzle of crumbling steel and bioluminescent vines that pulse with alien rhythms. I was a software engineer. Now?

My fingers hover over a console made of something between bone and coral. Symbols crawl across its surface, alive. The air thrums with a low, sub-audible song that vibrates in my molars.

Someone approaches—pale skin etched with glowing circuitry, eyes like liquid mercury. "The code is singing off-key," they say, voice resonating in my diaphragm rather than my ears. "Fix the melody before the roots forget."

A transparent sphere materializes, filled with swirling chromatic mist. My old instincts surface—patterns within patterns, nested loops of color cycling in Fibonacci sequences. But when I reach to adjust, the sphere shatters. Vines beneath my feet recoil as if burned.

The mercury-eyed being tilts their head. "Not through the fingers. Through the throat."

From the ruins above, a flock of crystalline birds spiral down. Each wingbeat releases discordant chimes. My pulse syncs with their fractured rhythm as understanding blooms: here, music is the operating system.

The air crackles with the scent of burnt ozone and wet earth as I stand before the bone-coral console, my shadow stretching and contorting like smoke under the pulsating vines. Old instincts wrestle with this new reality—the rigid logic of algorithms give way to something primal, something that breathes. I inhale deeply, tasting metallic notes of copper and alien pollen, my forgotten programming languages dissolving like sugar on my tongue.

The mercury-eyed entity’s command lingers: *Through the throat.* I press trembling palms to my collarbones, feeling vibrations surge beneath my skin. A low hum escapes my lips, igniting ripples in the corrupted mist swirling around us. The sensation is excruciating—like singing with shattered glass in my lungs—yet with each fractured note, the bioluminescent vines shiver in recognition. They curl upward, weaving bridges between collapsed towers as their pulses shift from sickly chartreuse to radiant cobalt.

Above, the crystalline birds spiral tighter, their discordant wingbeats chipping away at the dissonance. I push my voice lower, deeper, until the ground itself thrums like a struck gong. The shattered console reassembles—not through command lines, but through harmonic resonance. Numbers bloom as flickering auroras in the air, equations rewritten as polyphonic hymns. 

In my bones, I feel the city’s pain easing. Steel groans as broken spires knit together, fused by vines now glowing in perfect thirds and fifths. The mercury-eyed being bows as iridescent spores rise from my palms—raw data transformed into living psalms. Here, logic is a living thing, and I am no longer a coder of machines… but a composer of worlds.
