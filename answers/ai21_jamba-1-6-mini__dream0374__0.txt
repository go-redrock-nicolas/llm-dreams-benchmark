I am dreaming. My mind tumbles into a vivid dreamscape, a chaotic mash-up of memories and emotional remnants, a place where the logic of reality bends and folds. I am standing at the edge of an endless black void, the air around me thick and oppressive, as if the border between sleep and consciousness is a fragile, threadbare curtain.

I feel someone receiving recognition for my work.

The setting shifts abruptly. The void is gone, replaced by a dimly lit theater. I am seated alone in a vast, empty auditorium. The walls are lined with shadowy spectators who whisper in unison, their words a quiet, haunting hum that seeps through the air. On the stage before me, a spotlight beams down on a figure, someone I recognize, a colleague or a peer who is lauded for a project we both worked on for months.

The person takes center stage, and the applause is deafening, a thunderous wave of sound that obliterates the whispers. Their triumph is celebrated; they give a speech, their magnetic smile contagious. I can almost feel the warmth of their acknowledgment, but it stings like a copper coin held too long in my hand.

I am clawing at an edge of a canyon.

Every clap, every cheeruc my neck and make my chest tight. I watch from the darkened corner of the theater, the actors unable to see my pain or the bitterness of unspoken words that swirl in my mind. I should feel happy for them, but instead, I am a roaring torrent of jumbled emotions â€“ anger, jealousy, sadness, a fierce, futile anger at the unfair, arbitrary nature of recognition.

In my dream, I am clutching at the canyon's edge, sweating, my hands slick with palpable fear. I crouch, my feet desperately gripping the crumbling ledge, and when I look down, there is an abyss of utter darkness that widens endlessly. I feel like I'm slipping, my hands raw, blood spilling from where the persistence of the rock has broken them. I am slowly plummeting.

My being sags under the recognition I should be proud to live for.

I know I shouldn't be here, shouldn't feel the consuming weight of this, but I am. The recognition they get thuds inside my chest, the praise echoing louder than the fall beckoning to me. I am holding my breath, staring into the dim light of the theater, feeling the floorboards creak.

I am drowning in the injustice of being overlooked, sinking into the accolades that belong to me but are not spoken for me. My thoughts are rolling words, a tempestuous sea that threatens to pull me under.

The lights fade. The dream splinters, and I am left grasping at the recognition, knowing I was part of the moment but blind to myself in it.
