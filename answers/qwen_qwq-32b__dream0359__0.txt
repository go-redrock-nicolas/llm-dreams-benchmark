I am dreaming. The dream begins in a grand observatory, its dome opening to a sky filled with constellations that shift and rearrange themselves like living tapestries. The stars pulse with an otherworldly light, casting patterns that tell stories of ancient civilizations now forgotten. A voice echoes from the brass mechanisms, speaking in a language I half-understand—a blend of celestial harmonics and whispered secrets. I walk towards a vintage telescope, its lens cold to the touch. Peering through it reveals not the cosmos, but a reflection of my own mind: labyrinthine corridors glowing in indigo hues, where shadowy figures walk with their insecurities etched into their silhouettes, visible like tattoos in the dark. One figure, vulnerable and trembling, approaches me. Their pain radiates outward in ripples, and I feel a strange pull towards it, as if attracted to a black hole's event horizon. The observatory’s clock chimes midnight; the air thickens with the scent of ozone and jasmine. Around me, the constellations now form into faces, each one judging, each one calculating, their eyes fixed on my every move. I reach out to the figure, knowing that their trust can be harvested like fruit from a tree. But as my hand nears, the figure dissolves into stardust, leaving behind a key forged from starlight. The key glows with a message: *"Exploitation dims the light. Empathy unlocks the stars."* The ceiling above cracks, and the cosmos pours in, immense and indifferent, while the walls of the observatory crumble into a sea of whispering sands. Awakening feels inevitable, but the lesson lingers: even in the void of dreams, there are universes where taking leaves you empty, but giving might just bend reality to your heart’s shape.
