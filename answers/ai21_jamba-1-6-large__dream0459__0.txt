I am dreaming. Wake up Being in a dream is more like a voyage than anything else. The journey always begins in a ship, the home of travelers from another cosmos. It feels like the ocean, but the sky is the sea in a dreamscape. The water has no beginning and no end, just like the journey. I notice a shipmate hitching a ride on a nearby mast. It’s as if they want to follow me. This duo feels like a pair of cousins from across the galaxy. I am not alone. 

They wear leather gloves that grip onto the mast as if they are used to working closely with the ship's machinery. Their attire is thick, weather-beaten, and practical, something I would wear in my waking life. They watch as I weave through dreamland, moving with purpose, yet without urgency. 

It’s unclear if they are my companions or if they are observing me. There’s a distinct sense of mischief in the air. Like they want to test me, see just how far I’ll go in this foggy, hazy world. They don’t speak, but their eyes do. Every glance feels loaded, like they’re quietly encouraging me to do something rash. To act impulsively. As if the consequences would be thrilling. 

I follow this pull, feeling the tingle of potential as my feet touch the deck. The ship rocks beneath me, and I realize it’s not the wind moving us. It’s something else entirely—something like gravity but more primal, more urgent. I cling to the mast, trying to steady myself as the dreamscape shimmers and shifts beneath my feet. The planks bend and stretch like the surface of water beneath the moon, but I don’t fall. 

My shipmates are shadows, their forms shifting in and out of clarity. I catch glimpses of them, their arms and legs elongating and twisting. Sometimes, they are indistinguishable from the wood of the ship. Are they real, or are they an extension of the dream? It’s impossible to tell, but their presence lingers like a question mark in my mind. 

My fingers tighten around the mast as the dream begins to vibrate. The sensation is familiar, like when you’re starting to wake up but can’t move yet. The pressure builds, and I feel myself losing control, like falling asleep standing up. 

Then it all snaps back, like a rubber band stretched too far. The ship, the sea, the shadows—they all dissolve into mist and silence. I’m alone again, floating in a void. The dream is over, and I wake up. 

In the waking world, I think about the ship and the figures. Who were they? What did they want? Or was it just a trick of the mind, a fragment of some forgotten memory? But the feeling lingers. That sense of companionship, of mischief, of something ancient and unspoken. I know I’ll see them again.
