I am dreaming. I am drifting, gently, through the liminal hush of a half-lit corridor—a place that pulses with the aching quiet of lost friendships. The walls shimmer with smoky colors, as if someone has painted emotion itself onto the air. My shoes make no sound. There are closed doors on either side, and I sense, behind each, laughter and memory, muffled as though underwater.

I reach for the handle on one. The brass is cool, almost sentient, and the world behind it rushes into focus with phantom clarity—cold autumn afternoons at the park, the bonfire’s fragrant smoke drifting upward, shadows of friends arm-in-arm flickering across puddle mirrors. I see myself—a younger version—engulfed in easy laughter, time shining golden and endless ahead.

But here in this dream, my hands are empty. The faces behind each door appear blurred by the distance swelling between us, their voices dimming, replaced by the ticking of a clock I can’t place. Every step down this corridor seems to tilt the world beneath my feet, the gravity of growing apart tugging at my soul. I try to run, but the air thickens to honey, and my movements slow, windblown leaves scattering through my fingers.

Desperate to bridge the growing gap, I begin to carve messages into the air with my hands. Spectral calligraphy—glowing with all the colors of memory—swirls out and weaves itself into living streamers. One by one, the doors begin to sigh open, just a crack. From inside, tendrils of laughter and fragments of stories waft toward me, scented with nostalgia, bittersweet and beautiful.

I call out—a mixture of apology and hope—and my words echo forward and backward in time. I sense, with dreamlike certainty, that the lives behind these doors have spun on and outward, as have mine, each line of connection both fragile and luminous, like dew-spun filaments in morning light. The corridor widens, the walls growing translucent, and I see that every divergent path is threaded with invisible cords, humming softly. We are drifting, yes, but not lost—the music of old companionships playing on, just barely heard, in the deepest part of the night.

In this dream, I let go. The sadness of distance tastes like rain, but there is serenity, too—a quiet acceptance that love leaves marks that never fully fade, and even as I step forward, my friends live on in the shifting halls of memory and dream.
