I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a city that shouldn’t exist—a labyrinth of skyscrapers with glass facades that shimmer like liquid mercury, reflecting not the sky, but scenes from your past: childhood bedrooms, college dorms, pay stubs folded into paper cranes. The air hums with the static of a thousand whispered stock tickers. You’re standing in an elevator with no buttons, descending into the earth at a 45-degree angle. The walls are transparent, revealing a subterranean metropolis lit by bioluminescent fungi and the cold glow of cryptocurrency symbols etched into cavern walls.  

A figure materializes beside you, clad in a suit woven from strands of ticker tape. Their face is a shifting mosaic of Bloomberg terminals, numbers flickering where their eyes should be. They offer you a contract written in disappearing ink. “Invest *everything*,” they hiss, their voice a distorted chorus of CNBC anchors and your mother’s worried sighs. “The algorithm *knows*. The returns will be… *cosmic*.”  

You hesitate. Your hands tremble, not from fear, but from the weight of the decision. The elevator lurches to a stop, and the doors open onto a bridge suspended over a chasm of black oil. On one side: a utopia of golden skyscrapers, their spires piercing clouds that rain champagne. On the other: a wasteland of rusted machinery, where figures claw at the ground, their mouths full of loose change.  

The figure presses a pen into your hand. Its tip bleeds ink that smells like burnt coffee and regret. “Choose,” they whisper. “But know this: every dollar you risk is a year of your life. Every gain… a stolen breath. Every loss… a debt paid in dreams.”  

You glance down. Your savings are now a flock of sparrows in a cage strapped to your chest, their wings beating frantic rhythms. If you open the cage, they’ll fly into the void, transform into skyscrapers or sinkholes. You think of your grandmother’s hands, cracked from gardening, warning you that “money grows roots only when you plant it in the right soil.” You think of the thrill of a roulette wheel, the way adrenaline tastes like a dare.  

Suddenly, the bridge begins to dissolve. The sparrows screech. The figure’s face melts into a stock chart spiking upward, then collapsing into jagged teeth. You wake just as the pen touches the contract—your body drenched in sweat, your heart a frantic ticker tape of *yes* and *no*.  

In the silence afterward, you swear you hear the faint clink of coins falling, endlessly, into a bottomless vault.
