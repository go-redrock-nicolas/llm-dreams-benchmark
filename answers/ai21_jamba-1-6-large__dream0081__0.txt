I am dreaming. It's night.

The dream begins with you in a foreign country, where a sudden eruption of political unrest has occurred. Borders are closed, leaving you stranded and with rising anxiety. As day breaks, you find yourself in a bustling city square filled with a mix of angry protestors and heavily armed soldiers. The air is thick with tension, and you hear gunshots and yelling. You duck behind a fruit stall as chaos unfolds around you. The once vibrant market now resembles a warzone, with scattered debris and smoke in the air.

You notice an old man across the square, signaling to you. He ushers you toward a narrow alleyway, his face creased with an unspoken plea. You hesitate but decide to follow him. He leads you through a maze of dark, narrow streets, away from the chaos. The sound of your pounding heart fills your ears as you navigate the winding paths until you reach an old building. Inside, you enter a hidden basement.

The space is lit by dim, flickering lights and smells of damp earth. The walls are lined with ancient relics. The old man explains in a hushed voice that this place is a sanctuary, a hidden resistance base. You're not sure if he’s telling the truth or leading you into a trap.

You sit quietly in the corner of the dim basement, hugging yourself as the sounds of distant gunfire reach your ears. Slowly, others begin to enter the room, whispering to each other in a language you do not understand. They look at you with a mix of curiosity and mistrust, and you realize you are both their hope and their prisoner.

The dream shifts.

You're in a small clearing in a dense forest. The air is cool, and the only light comes from a full moon glowing through the dense canopy. You hear whispers and the rustling of leaves as shadows move in the distance. You turn around and see a dark figure approaching. The figure is cloaked in black and carries a lantern. It stops and holds the lantern up, revealing a face that is neither human nor animal. The features seem carved from stone.

You try to scream, but no sound comes out. As the figure takes a step toward you, the forest begins to fade, and you hear the echo of the old man’s words, telling you that the sanctuary was your only choice. You wake up just as the figure reaches out with a hand that looks like smoke, choking you.

You’re left gasping for air, and as you wake up, you see that you're safe in your bed, heart racing. The dream was so real you could still feel the cold, damp air from the forest clearing and the anxiety from the city square.
