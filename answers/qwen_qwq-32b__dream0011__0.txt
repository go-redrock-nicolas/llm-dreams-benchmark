I am dreaming. I'm sitting in what seems to be a high school classroom, but the desks are made of polished obsidian, gleaming under some indescribable light. The walls pulse with a faint bioluminescence, like the inside of a forgotten cathedral. My pencil is actually a slender black rod that hums when it touches the paper, each mark I make causing tiny sparks to jump from the page into the air. The first question stares up at me: "Define the color of the void between galaxies. Provide three ecological adaptations of civilizations that dwell there." I start to write, but the words twist into cursive smoke as they hit the air, forming spectral birds that fly away. The clock on the wall is a spiral of liquid mercury, its movements impossible to track. I turn the page, and the next question materializes—a fractal pattern asks me to solve for the gravitational pull of a black hole made entirely of laughter. I reach for my pencil again, but my hand phase-shifts through the desk, emerging on the other side clutching a glowing... something unnameable. The room begins to tilt, not just the desk but the very concept of up and down dissolving. I hear a voice, maybe mine or the collective hum of the universe: "Time is the least important dimension here." The exam paper flips itself backward now, showing questions in reverse script. They’re about correcting the equations of flight paths for birds migrating through parallel universes. I touch the paper, and suddenly I’m standing on a bridge woven from starlight, its cables humming lullabies in a language of dying stars. Below me, nebulae swirl like hurricanes, and distant planets orbit each other in impossible configurations. The exam is now a sentient book, its pages alive with equations that rearrange themselves when unwatched. The pressure mounts, but I realize this is a test of wonder, not knowledge. I start answering in hues and metaphors—let the words be constellations, let the math be song. Each correct answer lights a path forward, while wrong ones send shockwaves through the fabric of the dream. The final question blooms at the center of a black hole’s eye: "What is the question you must ask to become the answer?" And I—well, perhaps I dissolve into the ink, becoming the answer itself. The room crumbles, or maybe expands, into something sublime and vast, and for a moment, I am both the dreamer and the dreamed.\n
