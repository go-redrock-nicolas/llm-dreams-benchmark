I am dreaming. I am in a vast, ancient library, its ceiling lost in the swirling constellations, illuminated by thousands of floating lanterns that cast a warm, amber glow. The air smells of aged parchment and the faintest hint of bergamot. I don a crimson-boundVolume from a shelf marked with unknown scripts—Hindi, I believe. The script flows like rivers, each letter a ripple in a cosmic pond. As I open it, ink and memory spill out, not in words, but in colors and melodies.

The pages transform into a vibrant tapestry. I'm transported to a bustling, sunlit courtyard in Varanasi, where a group of elderly musicians play the sitar and bansuri in a dialogue with the Ganges itself. Their instruments seem to merge with the sounds of the flowing river, creating a symphony of water and wood. The music's rhythm matches the slow, deliberate strokes of a trio of painters working on immense scrolls beside them. Their brushstrokes are bold and fluid, each dab and swirl a story—a devotional poem to Shiva, Krishna, and the cycle of creation and destruction.

The painters don't look up as I stand there, a silent witness. One is a wizened man with eyes like dried amber, his hair a wild nest of silver. Another has a face smooth as river clay, her gaze fixed on the horizon. The third is a young woman (maybe the youngest, or perhaps her youth is an illusion) with skin the color of warm sand and tattoos that shimmer with constellations. Their brushes are made from the bones of forgotten birds, and their ink from cinnabar and crushed stardust. Each stroke of their brushes releases a puff of colored smoke that lingers, forming temporary particles that drift like tiny galaxies—a scene of a village festival under a full moon, then a night of monsoon rains dotsword Braindotsword Brain1. dp1dp=1dip2. spdip
