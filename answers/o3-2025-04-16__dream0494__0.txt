I am dreaming. …drift deeper into a lucid, prismatic dreamscape.

I stand at the center of an infinity-shaped meadow, two loops of wildflowers swirling together yet never quite merging. In the left loop, dew-kissed daisies and baby’s-breath cluster in soft whites and pastels—gentle, familiar, the essence of early comfort. In the right loop, towering foxglove and crimson poppies blaze in restless colors—bright, alluring, demanding to be seen. With every breath, the meadow hums with a faint heartbeat that feels unmistakably like my own.

A hush sweeps through the air, and translucent ribbons of memory sprout from the earth, curling upward like translucent vines. Each ribbon projects a vignette—moments of childhood attachment: the warmth of being cradled, the sharp chill of ignored cries, the rush of delight when a hand clasped mine, the slow sting of doors closed too soon. These memories swirl around me, forming a living gallery that pulses with emotion.

Then, from the seam where the two meadow loops kiss, a silver river unfurls. Its waters are liquid mirror, reflecting not just my current face but all my younger selves layered within. I kneel, and the river answers by transforming into a clear, spiral staircase descending beneath the ground—an invitation to travel inward.

Step by step, I descend. Every tread on the staircase is cushioned by cloudlike moss, yet echoes with the muffled thud of old anxieties: Will I be held? Will I be left? Will I lose myself trying to keep love nearby? The deeper I go, the more the staircase brightens, as though each fear becomes a lantern once acknowledged.

At the bottom, I enter an underground library whose shelves are carved directly into the glowing bedrock. Here, thick tomes of relational patterns rest side by side: “Yearning for Approval,” “Hyper-Independence,” “Revolving Door of Doubt.” Each spine gleams with runic letters that flicker between gold and rust, depending on whether the lesson is learned or still raw.

I pull out a weathered book labeled “Silent Promises.” The pages flutter open to reveal moving illustrations—child-me offering silence to avoid conflict, adult-me replaying the same hush to keep peace at any cost. A hush that costs connection. The ink melts, drips to the floor, and forms a silver pool that morphs into a mirror, showing me now breathing steadily in the present. I realize: the hush no longer protects; it imprisons.

A gentle rumble reverberates through the chamber. From the ceiling descends a mobile of luminescent origami cranes—each crane representing a person I’ve loved. The cranes orbit me, casting kaleidoscopic shadows that flicker between intimacy and distance. Some cranes swoop in close, wings brushing my cheek with soft hope; others hover at the perimeter, cautious, half-folded. I notice that a few cranes bear tiny paper keys within their beaks. I reach for one—my oldest friend’s crane—and ease the key free. It slides neatly into a small, unseen lock over my own heart, releasing a warm pulse that spreads like sunrise beneath my ribs.

Suddenly, the library walls dissolve into ripples, and I find myself back in the meadow, but now the two loops of the infinity symbol pulse in rhythm, drawing nearer. The daisies and foxgloves no longer vie for space; they intermingle, weaving a tapestry of quiet affection laced with vibrant passion. Above, an aurora of soft greens and violets sweeps across the sky, spelling out a mantra in shimmering letters: “I can need and still be free; I can love and still be me.”

With that realization, I exhale, and a gust of wind carries the meadow’s scent of honeyed earth and rain-washed leaves. The wind threads through the once-separate loops, stitching them into a single circle. The heartbeat that thrummed beneath it all steadies, deepens, harmonizes with mine.

Softly, dawnlight peeks over the horizon—golden, gentle, unwavering. The dream rolls open like a curtain, revealing not an ending but the first steps of a new act, a stage freshly set. I feel the cool dew on my feet, the sun warming my shoulders, the freedom to move through the meadow—both rooted and unbound. And somewhere within, a voice—my own, finally clear—whispers:

“I carry my origins, but they no longer carry me.”
