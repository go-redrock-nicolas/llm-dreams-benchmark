I am dreaming. The ancient catacombs stretch before me, an endless labyrinth of crumbling stone and damp, moss-slick walls. The air is thick with the scent of wet earth and something older—something metallic, like old blood or rusted iron. My torch sputters in my trembling grip, its flame licking feebly at the darkness before guttering out entirely. Shadows surge forward like living things, swallowing the narrow passage whole.  

For a heartbeat, there is nothing but the sound of my own breath—shallow, panicked. Then, just as my eyes strain to adjust, the torch flares back to life with a hiss, casting a sickly orange glow. The walls seem closer now, slick with a dark, viscous moisture that wasn’t there before. It beads and drips, smearing across the stone like ink.  

The flame flickers again, and this time, when the darkness rushes in, it doesn’t retreat. Instead, it lingers… and moves.  

Something breathes in the blackness. Not behind me—not ahead—but from *within* the walls themselves. A slow, rattling inhale, followed by a wet, guttural exhale. The stones press inward, flexing like ribcages, and suddenly I know with terrible certainty that these catacombs are not empty. They are not abandoned.  

They are alive.  

The torch gutters one last time—and dies forever.  

The darkness swallows me whole.
