I am dreaming. me.**Dream Journal Entry:**

**The Mirror Maze of Yearning**  
You stand at the threshold of a labyrinth, but this is no ordinary maze. Its walls are made of liquid mercury, reflecting fractured images of yourself: some versions bold and radiant, others hunched and spectral. The air hums with a dissonant melody, like a choir of whispers harmonizing with the crackle of distant thunder. Ahead, a golden door flickers in the haze, its surface etched with symbols that rearrange themselves as you blink—hieroglyphs of desires unnamed but deeply felt.  

Your feet sink into the floor, which isn’t stone but a gelatinous twilight, resisting each step. Shadows coil around your ankles, hissing warnings in a language of static and frost: *“What if it breaks you? What if it’s never enough?”* You recognize them—these are not external phantoms but your own voice, warped by centuries of withheld breath.  

Then, a shift. One mirror ahead shatters spontaneously, and through the jagged gap, you glimpse a meadow where the sky drips honey and trees grow upside-down, roots cradling galaxies. A figure there waves—a version of you, unburdened, laugh lines etched not by time but by joy. She shouts something drowned by the maze’s hum, but her eyes scream, *“Jump.* **Now.**”  

The mercury walls convulse. Skeletons of past regrets claw upward, skeletal hands trying to graft themselves to your wrists. But you lunge forward, not toward the golden door, but into the broken mirror. Glass shreds your skin, yet instead of blood, prismatic light spills from the wounds. The meadow rushes to meet you, air thick with the scent of crushed mint and burning stars.  

As your feet touch the iridescent grass, the maze collapses behind you into a nebula of dust. A single word reverberates in your bones, vibrating like a plucked harp string: **“Begin.”**  

You wake, fingers clutching the echo of starlight, the taste of honey still on your tongue.
