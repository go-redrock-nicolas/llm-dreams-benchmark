I am dreaming. As I stand submerged in the rising water, my panic intensifies. The dim fluorescent light of the elevator flickers ominously, casting eerie shadows on the walls. 

Suddenly, the elevator lurches, and the water level drops, revealing a hidden door that wasn't there before. With a deep breath, I swim towards it and manage to pull it open. I emerge into a sunlit meadow, surrounded by vibrant wildflowers and the soothing sound of a babbling brook nearby.

As I walk through this new realm, I start to regain my composure. A sense of peace washes over me, and I realize that the water in the elevator represented my fears and doubts, while this beautiful meadow symbolizes the latent potential within me. A soaring eagle captures my attention as it glides gracefully across the azure sky, and I take it as a sign of my ability to rise above my limitations.

With renewed strength, I return to the elevator and close the hidden door behind me. The water has receded to a tolerable level, and I am no longer afraid. I press the emergency call button and wait patiently for help to arrive, confident in my resilience and prepared to face whatever challenges lie ahead.


I am dreaming.
