I am dreaming. I am in a society where people communicate through dancing. Everyone has their own unique style and moves that express their emotions and thoughts. The sound of music fills the air as people dance together freely without any restrictions.

Today is my birthday and I want to celebrate it with my friends and community. But instead of using words, I need your help to send them a message using dance moves.

Here's what I want to say:

Happy Birthday to you!  You make me feel alive and curious about life.  I love learning new things from you and sharing them with others.  

You are my best friend who understands me better than anyone else does.  We have so much fun together playing games, going on adventures, and having conversations that don't end until we both agree to sleep.

You are my soulmate who completes me by complementing all my strengths and weaknesses.  We balance each other out emotionally, physically, and spiritually.  

You are my lover who makes me feel sexy and loved unconditionally.  We explore each other's bodies with tender touch and passionate kisses that leave marks on our skin for days after we part ways.

I hope you can see this message and dance along with me as I celebrate my birthday in this dream world where words don't exist anymore but meaning still does
