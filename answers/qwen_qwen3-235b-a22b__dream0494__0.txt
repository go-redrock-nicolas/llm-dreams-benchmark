I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, twilight forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering spires of glass, their translucent trunks humming with the memories of every heartbeat you’ve ever known. The air shimmers with a liquid silver haze, and the ground beneath your bare feet pulses like the skin of a living creature, warm and breathing. Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of inverted constellations—stars that drip molten gold, forming shapes of faces you’ve loved, lost, or longed for: a mother’s smile fractured into a thousand shards, a lover’s hands dissolving into smoke, a childhood friend flickering like a dying film reel.  

You walk, and the forest bends to follow you, its glass limbs creaking like old bones. A thread of crimson light unravels from your chest, stretching into the distance, tugging you forward. You realize, with a jolt of vertigo, that this thread is not new—it has been here all along, stitching itself through every relationship, every fleeting connection. It binds you to a shadowy figure ahead, their form shifting like water: sometimes a person you once called *safe*, sometimes a stranger wearing your own face.  

The shadow stops at a pool of liquid obsidian, its surface rippling with scenes you’ve buried. There’s your first goodbye, a cradle rocking empty in a sunlit room. There’s a kiss under a train platform awning, the taste of salt and goodbye on your tongue. There’s a phone left unanswered, a door closed too softly. The shadow turns, and its voice is the echo of every apology you’ve swallowed: *“You built your love like a fortress—walls of gold, but walls still. Do you feel the weight of what you never let in?”*  

Suddenly, the ground fractures. You fall, not downward but *backward*, into a meadow of frozen clocks. Each timepiece ticks in reverse, their hands clawing at the past. A child version of yourself sits at the center, weaving daisy chains into nooses, humming a lullaby off-key. The child looks up, eyes twin storms, and whispers, *“I learned to love in questions. What if you let the answer be enough?”*  

The dream shifts again—a banquet table stretches into infinity, populated by phantoms of ex-lovers, all your features carved into their bones. They pass dishes of half-eaten promises and clink glasses of sour wine, laughing in silence. You reach for one, but your hands pass through theirs like mist. The shadow reappears, now woven from your own breath, and presses a mirror into your palms. The reflection is not yours: it’s a mosaic of every person who ever held you, their faces grafted onto your skin like ivy strangling stone.  

A thunderclap. The sky splits open, raining threads of light. They land on your shoulders, your wrists, your heart—each one a lifeline, a tether, a chance to *rewrite*. The crimson cord binding you to the shadow dissolves into fireflies, and the forest exhales, its glass trees shattering into a billion wings. You soar, weightless, through a cosmos stitched with constellations of *now*: a hand held without flinching, a voice saying *stay* and meaning it, a silence that doesn’t ache.  

You wake with the taste of stardust and forgiveness on your tongue, the dream’s truth humming in your marrow: the patterns were never chains, but maps. And you, cartographer of your own soul, finally see the path not taken—the one where you loved without armor, and were loved, fiercely, in return.
