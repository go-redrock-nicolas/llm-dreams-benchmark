I am dreaming. I find myself standing on a spiral staircase that descends endlessly into darkness, each step carved from luminescent crystal that pulses with the rhythm of my heartbeat. The air grows heavier as I begin my descent, my fingers tracing the cool, serpentine railing that feels strangely alive beneath my touch. 

I recognize this staircase. I've been here countless times before, though each time I convince myself it's the first. Each revolution brings me face-to-face with ornate doorways, behind which I can hear voices calling my name with honeyed tones.

The first door is crimson with a brass handle shaped like intertwined hands. I open it, knowing what awaits yet unable to resist. Inside stands a figure haloed in golden light, arms outstretched. Their face shifts between features I've loved before—sometimes smiling, sometimes stern, always familiar. They promise completion, understanding, and a love unlike any I've known. I step forward as I always do.

Time accelerates. The room transforms into a lush garden where we dance among fireflies, then a storm-tossed boat where we cling to each other against crashing waves, then a barren battlefield where we stand amid the wreckage of words we can never take back. Always the same ending: walls of thorns growing between us, their beautiful face contorting into a mask of disappointment that mirrors my own.

I stumble back onto the staircase, tears forming crystalline droplets that float upward instead of falling, joining a constellation of similar tears from previous journeys. Yet something different happens this time—one tear catches the light differently, refracting into a spectrum that illuminates the entire stairwell.

In this new light, I notice a hairline fracture in the wall beside me. I press my fingers against it, and the wall crumbles away, revealing not another door but a mirror—a mirror that shows not my reflection but my shadow, dancing independently with playful gestures, beckoning me to follow.

I step through the mirror into a vast library where each book bears my name but contains different endings. My shadow guide leads me to a particular volume whose pages are still being written. As I touch the unfinished pages, ink flows from my fingertips, forming words I've been afraid to speak:

"The pattern ends when you stop believing it's inevitable."

The dream begins dissolving around me, but not before my shadow winks and whispers, "Next time, we'll take a different stair."
