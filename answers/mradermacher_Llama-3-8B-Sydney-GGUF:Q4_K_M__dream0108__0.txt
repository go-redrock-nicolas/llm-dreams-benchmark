I am dreaming. I'm in a hospital, and it's chaos. Patients are flooding in, some with critical injuries, others with unknown diseases. Resources are scarce, and staff is overwhelmed. I'm one of the nurses who try to help as many people as possible. But it seems hopeless. The situation keeps getting worse. 

I hear someone shouting for help. I turn around and see a man lying on the floor, bleeding heavily from his head. He's unconscious, and he looks dead. I rush to him and check his pulse. Nothing. I feel his wrist, but there's no beating heart. He's gone.

I kneel down beside him and touch his face. He's young, maybe in his late twenties or early thirties. He has dark hair and brown eyes. His skin is pale, and he's covered in dirt and blood. He reminds me of someone I once knew.

I wonder who he is and why he's here. Did he have a family? Friends? Loves?

I don't have time to think about these things because more patients need my attention. I see two women arguing loudly near the entrance. They're both pregnant, but one of them claims that the other stole her baby.

I run over to them and separate them physically. I tell them to calm down and listen to me. But they don't seem to hear me.

Then I notice something strange about the woman who accused the other of theft. She's not really human. Her skin is green, and she has pointed ears and horns on her head.

I realize that this is not a normal hospital where people come for illness or injury. This is a place where demons and ghosts interact with humans.

I decide to investigate further by going inside the man's body who died in front of me moments ago. I enter through his mouth and find myself inside his digestive system.

It's dark and moist down here, filled with bacteria and fungi that feed on food debris and waste products.

But I don't see any sign of him as a spirit or soul. Just lots of creepy creatures that scurry away when they sense my presence.

I wonder if death means the end of existence or merely transition into another realm where we exist beyond space and time.

As I contemplate these questions, I feel someone tugging at my leg from above. I look up and see a little girl standing there, crying hysterically.

She points toward the entrance where several people are gathered around something lying on the ground.

I climb out of the man's stomach and follow her back to where everyone is congregating.

When I arrive, I see what they're staring at: A baby boy who looks no older than six months old. He's naked except for a blue diaper, and his skin is translucent like cellophane paper.

His eyes are closed, but he has a peaceful expression on his face as though he knows something about life that we don't.

I approach him cautiously, afraid to touch him for fear of damaging him somehow.

But then I notice something unusual about him too: He doesn't have any internal organs like lungs or kidneys or even a brain! Just a heart made of light that beats steadily against the dark fabric of space and time.
