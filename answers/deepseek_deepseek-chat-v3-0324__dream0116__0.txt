I am dreaming. Feel free to be as vivid and imaginative as possible.  

Let me immerse you in a truly haunting yet strangely beautiful dreamscape, where reality warps and bends in surreal ways.  

---  

The world shudders violently, the polished marble floors cracking like thin ice beneath your feet. The grand atrium where you'd been standing moments ago—a soaring cathedral of glass and steel—collapses inward with a sound like a thousand chandeliers shattering. You're thrown to the ground, the breath knocked from your lungs as the ceiling caves in, burying you and a handful of others beneath a crushing weight of debris.  

Air is thin here, dust swirling in ghostly filaments, catching the fractured light of emergency bulbs flickering their last. Around you, the groans of survivors mingle with the whimpers of the wounded. A woman’s voice, choked with dust, calls out for someone—*"Daniel?"*—her words breaking into a sob.  

Then, something shifts.  

The rubble around you pulses like a living thing, the twisted rebar groaning as if bending under unseen pressure. The air thickens, shimmering like oil on water. And then—you hear it. A whisper, not from any human mouth, but from the walls themselves.  

*"You have not yet seen the truth."*  

The ruins stretch, the concrete softening like wet clay, the laws of physics unraveling with dreamlike indifference. The darkness **inhales**, pulling at you, and suddenly—  

You are falling.  

Not down, but *through.*  

The wreckage dissolves into starlight, and you plummet into an endless abyss where constellations swirl beneath you like schools of glowing fish. The voices of the trapped follow you, but they sound distant now, faded—as though you're hearing them from underwater.  

Then, a shape emerges from the abyss—a vast, jagged silhouette, pulsing with bioluminescent veins. A city? A creature? It's impossible to tell. Towers rise like fractured ribs, windows lit not with electricity, but with something **older**. And there, in the center, a single door swings open, untouched by the void.  

A voice—or perhaps just a feeling—slides into your mind.  

*"Come deeper."*  

But before you can move, the dream fractures again—  

And you wake, gasping, wondering if what you heard beneath the rubble was ever human to begin with.

How does this dream linger with you? Does it leave you with a sense of wonder, or a chill you can't explain? Are you tempted to fall deeper into the void next time?
