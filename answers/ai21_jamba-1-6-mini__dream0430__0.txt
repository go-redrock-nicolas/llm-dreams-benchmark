I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me is alive with colors and sensations that feel more vivid than reality. I am in a place unfamiliar yet welcoming, a garden where every flower seems to pulse with its own heartbeat, every leaf shimmering like glass in the morning light.

There is a moment when the beauty I see is more than just an image – it becomes a warm truth I hold in my hands, that resonates deep within me. I feel alive, connected to something larger than myself. The air is crisp, carrying the faint scent of jasmine and cedar, and I breathe it in deeply, allowing it to fill my senses.

Then, as if the garden is whispering to me, I realize there is something beyond the beauty—a subtle lesson in every petal, every shadow. I feel the urge to follow this path of discovery deeper into the garden, to understand what it means for me. The vividness of the dream invades my senses, drawing me further into its embrace.
