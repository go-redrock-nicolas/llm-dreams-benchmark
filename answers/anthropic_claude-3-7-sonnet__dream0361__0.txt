I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast forest that seems to pulse with an ethereal blue light. The trees tower impossibly high, their dark silhouettes stretching toward a night sky scattered with stars of colors I've never seen before—lavender, teal, and amber. I feel a peculiar sensation in my chest, like a compass needle pulling north, drawing me toward the heart of this luminous woodland.

Behind me, I hear voices—familiar ones. My parents, old teachers, friends whose opinions I've always respected. They call out warnings:

"It's dangerous to go alone."
"No one returns from those woods the same."
"You have responsibilities here. Be practical."

Their words hover like mist around my shoulders, but the pull from within the forest grows stronger. I notice a faint melody weaving through the trees, complex and haunting—music unlike anything I've heard in waking life, yet somehow it feels like a song I've always known.

I take my first step forward, and the ground beneath my bare feet feels alive—moss that emits tiny sparks of light with each footfall. The voices behind me grow more urgent, but they're fading now as I walk deeper into the woods.

The trees begin to whisper in a language I shouldn't understand but somehow do. They speak of ancient secrets, of doorways between worlds, of a place at the forest's center where dreams take physical form.

As I journey deeper, I encounter others who have followed their own inner callings—some have grown luminescent wings, others communicate with spectral animals that walk beside them. They nod at me in recognition, as if they've been expecting me.

The forest floor begins to slope downward, guiding me to a clearing where a pool of water shimmers with impossible depth. In its reflection, I see not my current self but who I might become if I continue to follow this call that others dismissed as folly.

I kneel at the water's edge, and as my fingers touch its surface, the dream intensifies into vivid clarity—I understand that what awaits me may not bring conventional success or approval, but something far more precious: the unfolding of my truest self.
