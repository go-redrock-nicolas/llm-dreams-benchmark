I am dreaming. …am suddenly aware that this is all a dream, yet everything feels sharper, more saturated—each sound echoes as though struck from crystal, every hue impossibly electric. I’m standing in the middle of an office that floats miles above a night-lit ocean. The walls are panes of shifting starlight, the floor a polished slice of moonstone that thrums beneath my feet like a distant drum. Bookshelves drift lazily through the air like silent zeppelins, their pages fluttering in a breeze that seems to come from nowhere. A grand clock made of swirling nebulae keeps the time, but its hands loop back on themselves, ignoring any mortal sense of minutes or hours.

Across from me sits my client: they appear as a figure woven from fine threads of smoke and silver. Grief has tangled the strands, knotting them so tightly that flashes of painful crimson pulse between the fibers. Their eyes are twin constellations—beautiful, and on the verge of going supernova.

Outside the windows of starlight, a meteor shower bursts into slow motion, every streak a luminous tear sliding across the sky. The office tilts imperceptibly, as though rocked by the weight of their feelings, yet both of us remain grounded on the shining floor. I feel the hum of their sorrow through the soles of my shoes.

“Everything is falling apart,” they whisper, and their voice sounds like the rustling of old letters found in an attic. “I can’t hold myself together.”

I inhale; the air tastes of warm vanilla and night-blooming jasmine. I remember: this is a dream, so I allow myself to shape it. I reach out a hand, and instead of words, a ribbon of calm, glimmering light unspools from my fingertips. It drifts toward them, wraps gently around their shoulders, pulsing with a soft, iridescent glow.

“Feel this?” I say. My voice emerges as a chord—harp-like, shimmering. “It’s a reminder that within every tangle there is still a thread of quiet.”

The silver-smoke figure shivers. Each inhalation draws some of the light into their chest; each exhalation releases a puff of dark ash that floats away, dissolving into tiny fireflies.

I invite them to close their starry eyes. The meteors outside imitate the slow rhythm of breathing: bright pulse, gentle fade… bright pulse, gentle fade. The office becomes a vast lung shaped of moonlit crystal, expanding and contracting with us.

“Tell me,” I murmur, “if your emotions were a landscape, what would you see?”

Their head tilts back. The smoke-threads swirl, throwing reflections onto the nebula clock. “A forest after a storm,” they say, voice trembling like dew on a spiderweb. “Broken branches everywhere, mud swallowing the roots, thunder still echoing. I’m afraid the sun will never return.”

I nod, closing my eyes to picture it. Immediately, the scene unfurls between us like an enormous pop-up book. We now stand in that forest: towering pines snap and reassemble with soft clicks of paper hinges; puddles of mirrored rainwater become silver mirrors, rippling with each heartbeat. The air is charged with petrichor—the perfume of damp earth.

“In this forest,” I tell them, “listen for the birds that never stopped singing.” I cup my hands; out flutters a tiny wren woven from gold filaments. It darts through the trees, releasing musical notes that rise like soap bubbles. Each note finds a broken branch and repairs it, leaving behind buds of bright green.

They watch, awestruck, as the undergrowth drinks the music and sprouts crocuses radiant as sunrise. “But I still feel the thunder,” they admit. Their chest flickers crimson again.

“Thunder doesn’t mean forever,” I say. I raise my palm, catching one last rumble of sound. It condenses into a silver marble, heavy and buzzing like a beehive. “Let’s give it a home.” I place the marble in a hollow knot of an oak; the tree glows warmly, absorbing the storm, turning the vibration into a deep, reassuring purr—like a cat curled at our feet.

The client’s form stabilizes: smoke turns to gentle mist, the silver threads uncurl, revealing veins of soft pastel light. Their constellation eyes regain a steady twinkle—no supernovas imminent tonight.

They look down and notice small seedlings sprouting around their ankles, each bearing tiny bells that chime whenever self-compassion flowers. They lift their gaze to me, and for the first time they manage a faint smile that scatters motes of glimmer across the scene.

“I’m… lighter,” they say, sounding surprised by their own voice. “Not fixed, but… possible.”

I respond with a slow nod, causing the nebula-clock’s hands (now hovering over the tree line) to pause in quiet affirmation. “Healing rarely snaps into place,” I remind them, “but possibility is the door. You’ve opened it tonight.”

The forest begins to flake into starlight flakes, swirling upward, reassembling into the floating office again. Our moonstone floor flickers like the surface of a calm pond. Somewhere below, whales sing through the dark ocean, their calls echoing in harmonic sympathy with the bells on the seedlings we just left behind.

The door of the office materializes—a gleaming archway etched with runes that shimmer like sunrise. Beyond it lies whatever tomorrow will be: unknown, but no longer terrifying. The client and I exchange a final look. They press a hand over their chest—over the place where crimson lightning once flickered—and a soft, evergreen glow radiates through their fingertips.

With gratitude shining from their constellation-eyes, they step toward the door. It opens onto a horizon filled with peach-colored clouds and a sun rising on multiple horizons at once, as though the sky itself has decided to give them extra chances at dawn.

I watch them go, and the dream tilts again, melting my surroundings into watercolor swirls. The nebula clock winds backward; the meteor tears sew up the night. Everything folds, folds, folds until it slips into a single silver seed that nestles into my palm. I whisper, “Grow well,” close my fingers around it… and awaken.
