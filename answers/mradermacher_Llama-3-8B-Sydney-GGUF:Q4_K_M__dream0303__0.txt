I am dreaming. I am presented with multiple attractive options requiring an immediate choice without time for careful consideration.  In this moment of forced
decisiveness, I choose to follow my heart.

I see a beautiful woman standing in front of me.  She has long hair, dark eyes, and perfect skin.  She is dressed in a flowing white gown that accentuates her curves.
She smiles at me, inviting me to come closer.

I feel attracted to her physically and emotionally.  I want to touch her hand, kiss her lips, hold her tightly.  I also want to know her inner self, understand her thoughts,
feel her emotions.

Beside her, I see another man who is equally handsome.  He has short hair, blue eyes, and a muscular body.  He is wearing a suit that highlights his masculinity.
He stares at me, challenging me to make a choice.

I feel confused by my feelings towards both of them.  How can I choose between two such perfect individuals?

I decide to ask them some questions to help me make up my mind.

"Hello, who are you?" I say to the woman.

"Hi, I'm Sarah," she replies with a sweet voice. "And this is my friend John."

"Nice to meet you, Sarah and John," I say politely.

"But why are you here? Why did you come to me?"

"I came because I sensed your presence," says Sarah. "I felt an connection with you that I've never felt before with anyone else."

"I came because I wanted to see you face to face," says John. "I wanted to talk to you personally."
