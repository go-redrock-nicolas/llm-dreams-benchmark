I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

It begins with a slow, luminous pulse—the world around you is veiled in whispers of indigo and silver, as though you’ve just stumbled into the heart of a moonbeam. In this dream-realm, you’re standing at the edge of a meadow that glitters like spilled powdered sugar. The grass sways in timid ripples, each blade shimmering with an otherworldly glow. You breathe in, and the air tastes faintly of vanilla and stardust.

Just a few steps away, you notice a small carousel—it is tarnished gold, ringed by antique horses carved from pale wood. Their manes are tangled with ribbons of cornflower blue, and each plastic eye seems to peer into your soul without judgment. As you draw closer, you feel your cheeks grow unexpectedly hot, your throat tightening with an emotion that shouldn’t be there at all.

A child’s laugh echoes in the distance, and you recall the giggling joy from your own childhood—those afternoons so long ago when the simplest toy or a piece of candy could spark rapturous delight. But now, in this moment, you’re startled to find tears gathering in your eyes. This carousel means nothing to you in waking life. You have no memory of ever riding one like it, yet a wave of profound longing surges inside you, twisting your heart into knots.

You climb onto one of the horses—its chipped paint revealing layers of forgotten color, each shade telling a story hidden from conscious memory. As you settle down in the saddle, the music begins: soft flute tones carried on a breeze that seems to swirl only around you. The carousel lurches to life, slowly spinning, and you feel an ache erupt in your chest. It’s the kind of ache that usually comes from saying goodbye to someone you cherished, though you cannot say what exactly you are losing here.

Unsure of why your eyes sting with sadness, you let the emotion wash through you. You see the tears falling onto the wooden mane, each drop adding a glimmering polka dot to the old paint. For a fleeting moment, you sense that this place—this oddly forgotten carousel—represents every feeling you’ve ever buried, every joy and pain long placed on a dusty shelf. Now it’s all rushing out in a swirling, kaleidoscopic shimmer.

Around and around you go, each slow rotation digging deeper into the secret corners of your heart, unearthing regrets and hopes you didn’t even know you’d kept. Light filters in from an unseen moon, casting dancing shadows that flicker like tiny, mischievous spirits cheering on your release of tears. Yet, despite the sorrow, a warmth grows in your chest—an acceptance, a catharsis, a quiet nod toward your own vulnerability.

The carousel drifts to a stop, the last note of the flute trailing off on the breeze. You dismount, tears still trembling on your lashes. You place your hand on the horse’s muzzle. It’s smooth where the paint has been worn by the gentle caress of time. Gratitude wells up in you, surprisingly calm and steady, as though you’ve just shared a wordless conversation with an old friend.

And as the dream begins to fade, you realize that, for once, you don’t need any justification for your tears. It is enough to have felt so deeply, to have a glimpse into a tenderness you didn’t expect. The meadow dims, the carousel dissolves, yet the warmth in your chest remains—a quiet reminder that even in the most peculiar settings, your heart sometimes leads you to truths beyond ordinary understanding.
