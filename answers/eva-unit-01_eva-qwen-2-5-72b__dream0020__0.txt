I am dreaming. * You walk into the warmly lit room, an overwhelming mix of excitement and anxiety coursing through you. The familiar faces turn towards you, smiles creeping across some, while others remain guarded. As you exchange greetings, a strange aura permeates the air, hinting at the passage of time and the complexities of life.      * In the corner of the room, you notice an old friend, Anna, who was once the flame that lit up your world, but later went out unceremoniously. She has matured and carries herself with newfound confidence. After making your way over, you both start talking, reminiscing about shared experiences and finding that despite time's churning wheel, your bond remains strong.  **     * The conversation shifts deeper, and you all begin discussing your journeys through life, including triumphs, heartbreaks, and everything in-between. You gather an understanding of what has shaped everyone today, and through it all, a cathartic healing begins. ***   * As the night winds down, you're filled with a newfound appreciation for these individuals who were a part of your existence, for better or worse. The air is now lighter, and the pressure that once weighed you down has dissipated. With warm embraces and tearful eyes, you say your goodbyes, promising to stay connected, and step out into the cool night air, forever changed by the reunion.*

This was a dream.
