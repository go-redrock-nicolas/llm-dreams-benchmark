I am dreaming. find yourself in a crowded room filled with victims, some with critical injuries needing immediate attention. The room is chaotic, filled with the sounds of distress, cries for help, and medical personnel shouting orders.

Suddenly, an earthquake hits, shaking the building violently. The room starts to collapse around you as people scramble to escape. Dust fills the air, making it difficult to see anything more than a few feet ahead. You try to maintain your balance but find yourself being tossed from side to side by aftershocks.

As the dust starts to settle, you realize that the building you're in has completely collapsed. The only way out is through the rubble-filled hallways. You steel yourself and begin to navigate the treacherous passageways, using your flashlight to guide you through the darkness.

Behind you, you hear someone calling for help. You turn around and see a young girl trapped under a massive beam. Her eyes are wide with terror as she gasps for air. You quickly assess the situation, knowing there's no time to waste.

With a deep breath, you dig through the debris, clearing away broken wood and metal beams until you finally reach her. She gasps for breath as you pull her free, and you carry her to safety, making sure she's okay.

As you continue your search, you come across a group of people trapped in a mangled elevator car. You know there's no time to wait for heavy machinery to arrive, so you use all your strength to pry open the mangled doors. 

One by one, you rescue them from their living tomb, their faces etched with gratitude as they stagger out into the open air.

Finally, after what feels like hours of digging and rescuing, you emerge from the rubble, exhausted but triumphant. The sky is beginning to lighten, and rescue teams are arriving to help those who have survived.

As you look around, you see the devastation all around youâ€”buildings reduced to rubble, fires still burning, and people, some injured, others simply shell-shocked, wandering aimlessly trying to make sense of what had just happened.

And yet amidst all the chaos and destruction, there is a sense of hope and resilience that fills your heart, knowing that even in the face of overwhelming adversity, humanity still endures.
