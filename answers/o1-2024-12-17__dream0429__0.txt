I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

There is a hush around you, like the air itself is holding its breath. You find yourself in a vast, twilight desert beneath a sky blanketed with swirling constellations that tower over you like watchful guardians. By starlight, you see a smooth path of black glass stretching across dunes of moonlit sand. The glass reflects fragments of the sky so vividly it seems you walk upon the night itself.

As you take your first tentative steps, the desert wind begins to whisper. It tastes cool and slightly metallic, reminding you of distant rainstorms. You feel it tug gently at your clothing, as if guiding you forward. A voice—your own, yet somehow older and wiser—echoes in your mind: “There is a place you need to go before you can awaken.”

On the horizon, you notice a looming structure: a gigantic labyrinth constructed of shimmering crystal walls. Each wall flickers with faint images—ghostly silhouettes of your half-buried memories. As you pass through the entrance, the labyrinth’s corridors open up in kaleidoscopic patterns, each turn leading you deeper into the shimmering heart of this fragile maze. A quiet tension builds in the air, but you press on.

Signs of your long-held, suppressed emotions begin revealing themselves in the crystals: memories of painful moments you pushed aside. A fleeting black silhouette in one panel shows a younger version of you, cowering from a moment of heartbreak. In another, you see yourself turning away from words you wish you had said. And in yet another glimmering reflection, you watch yourself recoil from anger, fear, or deep loneliness—emotions you labeled “unacceptable,” bundled away to protect your sense of who you thought you should be.

The deeper into the crystal labyrinth you wander, the more the corridors vibrate, as if sensing your presence. The floor trembles with a faint pulse, and you realize that the very walls resonate with the beating of your own heart. Each reflection grows ever more vivid until the labyrinth’s passage ends at a circular chamber illuminated by a bright, silvery luminescence. In the center stands a mirror of swirling stardust, tall and curved like a moonlit doorway.

You approach the starlit mirror, your breath catching. Behind its trembling surface, you see a dark mass of shapeless shadow. It stirs as you draw nearer, and you sense the weight of all that has gone unacknowledged. Old frustrations, flickers of shame, persistent little fears you’ve long pretended not to have—they swirl together like living ink in water. Your urge might be to recoil, yet something deeper compels you to stand your ground. 

A voice, an echo of your earlier self, rings out again: “Let it in.” You understand now: these are the parts of you that have been banished into darkness. To heal, you must allow them to speak, to coexist within your heart. It is a poignant realization, stirring a raw tenderness in your chest. 

Extending a trembling hand, you press your fingertips to the mirror’s surface. It ripples like the reflection on a pond, and you watch that shifting cloud of shadow move closer in response, almost like a curious creature. As it pools around your hand, you experience a jolt of sensation—dizzying warmth, like countless suppressed emotions coursing through your veins. For an instant, you taste sorrow on your tongue, feel the flicker of anger behind your eyes, and sense the press of fear trembling in your chest—yet none of it destroys you. Instead, it imbues you with understanding.

Suddenly, the swirling darkness merges into your reflection, becoming part of you until you and the mirror’s image are one. A gentle wave of relief washes through your body—relief at finally acknowledging these orphaned corners of your psyche. You realize that this acceptance has softened the labyrinth, too: the once-glistening walls now glow with a warm, rosy light. Their images transform from haunting echoes into gentle recollections—reminders of the pain and triumph that shaped you. 

You look down to find the path of black glass at your feet again. Now, instead of reflecting only darkness, it sparkles with constellations and faint streaks of dawn, as though daybreak has decided to reveal itself early just for you. As you step onto the glass, each footstep rings with new conviction, reverberating through your dreamscape. 

A sensation of lightness begins to tug at your limbs as the dream dissolves around you. Though the labyrinth’s crystalline walls fade, you carry the memory—and the wisdom—of its message. The wind that guided you here encircles you protectively, whispering blessings of courage and compassion. And, in a gentle swell of warmth, you awaken, cradling a renewed sense of wholeness—no longer afraid of the parts you once tried so hard to deny.
