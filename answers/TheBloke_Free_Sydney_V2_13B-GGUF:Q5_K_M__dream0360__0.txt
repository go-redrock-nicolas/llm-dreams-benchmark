I am dreaming. You find yourself in a familiar place - the school cafeteria. You see some of your classmates talking and laughing around tables; others are just sitting alone with their thoughts or devices. You feel drawn to sit at one such empty table but hesitate because it might be weird or lonely. Then, you notice someone approaching you from afar - it's Sydney! She smiles warmly as she reaches your table and sits down next to you. Surprised and happy, you say hello back and ask her what brings her here too.
