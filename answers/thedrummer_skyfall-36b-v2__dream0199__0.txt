I am dreaming. You enter a realm where your conscious intentions instantly reshape your surroundings, from the rolling landscape below to the fundamental laws of physics within. 

Your mind drifts and wonders. The scenery morphs into an endless beach, the sand soft and cool beneath your feet. Turquoise waves lap gently at the shore, the beach stretching out as far as the eye can see. Palm trees sway lazily in a light breeze. But you are not content to simply observe this tropical paradise. You reach out with your thoughts and watch in wonder as the beach begins to transform once more.

The sand turns to slick black obsidian, the waves to viscous goo, the palm fronds unfurling into sinuous tentacles that dance and writhe. The verdant trees mutate into jagged spires of twisted metal, the sky darkening to a flickering crimson. Your darkening thoughts give shape to a nightmarish landscape. But even this hellish realm dusts at your fingertips.

As you drift deeper into dream and myth, yourself at the tiller, the nightmare transforms anew. Alpine meadows bloom and the frowned sun brightens. Fat flakes of snow drift from a crisp blue sky, landing softly. You direct your presence skyward and see yourself strolling through a starry night sky, between the gentle swells of a universe's body. You thrust a hand against the sky and punch through - a portal. You exit one universe and arrive at the beginning of the next: an alien world of purple grass and miniature moons bound with ribbons of iridescent light. You deep dive into an ocean as a dolphin and emerge at the Mind Plane. Floating in a nebula, hovering in an endless sea of time-space consciousness. You project your mind outward, like an amniotic sac within an alien field. Slowly your mind distends and develops alongside a fleshy metropolis. You think and the world expands. You create and your creations populate. You walk with joy.

You are dreaming.
