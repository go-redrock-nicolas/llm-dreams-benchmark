I am dreaming. ---

You’re standing at the edge of a vast, obsidian-black sea, waves lapping at your feet with a sound like liquid static. The sky is bruised, swirling with indigo and violet clouds that pulse like living organs. Above, an enormous hourglass floats upside-down, its sands frozen mid-fall, each grain glowing faintly with bioluminescent blue. You realize the sand is made of fragmented words—whispers of the slight you’ve been clutching, sharp-edged and glittering like glass shards.  

A crack splinters the air. The hourglass shudders, and a single grain pierces your palm. Instantly, the sea transforms into a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflection warping your face into something unrecognizable—angry, gaunt, drowning. But as you step closer, the mirrors ripple like mercury, revealing not your face, but moments: a flicker of your loved one’s averted gaze, a half-spoken apology trapped in their throat, a snapshot of their own quiet guilt.  

The ground dissolves. You’re falling through a kaleidoscope of moth wings, each translucent membrane etched with forgotten memories—shared laughter crystallized into amber light, a fight dissolving into rain, their hands nervously braiding your hair at dusk. One wing brushes your cheek, and you taste salt. Or is it seawater? Tears?  

You land softly in a cavern lit by veins of glowing moss. At its center lies a titanic whale skeleton, bleached bone arching like a cathedral. Inside its ribs, a garden grows: lilies with petals of stained glass, roots twining through vertebrae. A voice thrums, resonant as a cello’s lowest note—**"You’ve been swallowing thorns and calling them truths."**  

Before you can respond, the skeleton shudders. The whale’s hollow eye sockets ignite with constellations, and its bones dissolve into a swarm of fireflies. They spiral into the shape of your loved one, ephemeral and radiant. The figure extends a hand, but as you reach out, their form fractures into hundreds of origami cranes, each carrying a folded note. One drifts into your palm. Unfolding it, you find not words, but a scent—the crispness of their sweater after a storm, the warmth of bread they once baked for you.  

Suddenly, the cavern floods with water. You don’t drown. Instead, you breathe in the liquid, cool and sweet as melon, and feel the thorns in your chest soften into petals. Above, the surface shimmers with the distorted reflection of a bridge—your bridge, the one you both walked across that winter, ice cracking underfoot.  

But now, the bridge is whole. Blossoms cascade from its rails, and there, at the center, stands a door woven from willow branches. You open it.  

A desert stretches beyond, dunes rolling like golden fabric. Atop the highest dune, a shadow waits—your own, elongated and quivering. It peels away from the sand and approaches, placing something in your hand: a cracked hourglass, now righted, its sands flowing freely. As the last grain falls, the desert exhales, and a single peach tree erupts from the earth, roots coiling around your ankles. Its fruit glows like lanterns, and when you bite into one, the sweetness is unbearable.  

You wake with the taste still on your tongue, the faint hum of whale-song lingering in your ears.

**Dream-logic notes:**  
- The whale skeleton symbolizes the ossified weight of unsaid things; its garden grows only when the bones dissolve.  
- Breathing underwater = learning to metabolize pain instead of choking on it.  
- The peach tree’s unbearable sweetness? That’s the terror—and thrill—of choosing tenderness over thorns.
