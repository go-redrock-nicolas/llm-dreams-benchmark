I am dreaming. You slip into the depths of sleep and find yourself standing alone on a bridge carved from starlight. The heavens above glow in a velvety midnight blue, pinpoints of sparkling constellations swirling lazily across the dome of the sky. Beneath your feet, the bridge stretches in both directions, disappearing into thick, gently churning clouds. With every uneasy step you take, the bridge trembles underfoot, as if unstable and ready to dissolve under the slightest pressure.

A sharp feeling of panic coils in your stomach: you carry an immense burden, an almost tangible weight in your arms—like a chest box hewn from rough crystal, locked tight and emanating a sorrowful throb. It feels too heavy to carry alone, but you sense that, within its heart, it holds something of utmost importance. The mere thought of letting it tumble off the bridge into the swirling currents below awakens a biting fear: if it was to be lost, an irreparable piece of yourself might be cast to oblivion.

Desperate for relief, you turn around, searching the empty expanse for any sign of friendly faces. Suddenly, figures begin to appear through the haze: drifting shapes at first, and then distinct silhouettes of people you know. Family, friends, past mentors—some living, some long departed, all somehow present at once. Their expressions glow with faint celestial light. As they draw closer, you see the reflection of your own worry in each of their faces.

But when you call out for help, voice echoing in the starry void, each figure looks at you with eyes full of longing, of sympathy… yet their mouths don’t form words. They reach out, arms extended, nearly touching the trembling crystal chest you hold, and then—nothing. It’s as though an invisible force prevents them from easing your burden. Some stand at the edges of the bridge, arms dropping to their sides, their faces collapsing into sorrow. Others attempt to speak, their lips moving soundlessly, as if sealed by the same shimmering barrier.

Your heart sinks. You feel as though your needs have gone unheard, your pleas bouncing off the unresponsive sky. The chest in your arms grows heavier, the intangible sorrow pulsing like a heartbeat. The once-solid rails of the bridge begin to fade away, leaving only a wisp of silver to keep you from toppling into the rolling, pale clouds below.

In the distance, a low rumble resonates, and you see a wave cresting through the sky. It is not a wave of water but a surge of luminous, opalescent light, cresting and foaming as it charges forward. It snakes through the heavens, swallowing stars in its path. The wave’s brilliance washes over you like a rising tide. You’re overcome by its radiance, the unspoken promise that something—if you can endure—will emerge from this cataclysmic event.

The swirl of shimmering energy floods the dream, and, for a moment, it’s as if your hunched figure is caught in a warm, glowing sunrise large enough to fill the universe. In the face of this unstoppable force, the figures around you wane into silhouettes of pure brightness. Though none can grasp your burden, you feel a gentle press of reassurance from each person as they touch the air near your trembling arms. Their silent support seeps into you, combining with the wave’s luminous strength.

Gradually, you realize the burden is still yours, but the chest’s lock has loosened, and you can almost see inside. With the surge of light washing over your body, you hear a hushed crackle—as though the chest is finally responding to the collective touch of everyone you reached out to. You feel an unexpected surge of warmth, a stirring deep in your core, a sense that while this crisis is still yours to face, you aren’t truly alone. Even if they cannot physically bear the weight, their presence is woven into the calm that’s spreading through you.

You can’t tell if the wave devours the bridge or transforms it, but it no longer matters. Instead, your vision contracts inward, focusing on the radiant glow emanating from the now-open chest in your hands. Through the cracks in its crystalline walls, you glimpse something that shines with the luminous quality of a rising star. And with every trembling step you take on that starlit passage, supported by the impossible chorus of your silent onlookers, you sense a subtle truth: you can stand tall, you can endure, and you can meet whatever comes next, even if it terrifies you.

As the dream fades and the clouds dissolve away, the last thing you see is the chest flickering with a soft light. You awake—heart pounding, pulse thrumming—yet undeniably touched by that tangible reminder that, somewhere deep within, a powerful, indomitable spark remains.
