I am dreaming. The air around me is thick and heavy, shimmering with an unnatural hue—somewhere between twilight indigo and the sickly yellow of a fading bruise. The ground beneath my feet isn’t quite solid; it shifts like water-darkened sand with every step, pulling me deeper into this strange, weightless remorse.  

Ahead, the figure of someone I love stands motionless, their silhouette haloed in flickering candlelight. Their face is turned just enough that I can see the glistening trail of tears down their cheek, each drop falling with unnatural slowness, suspended in the thick air before vanishing into nothing. Their eyes—god, their *eyes*—are wide with hurt, pupils trembling like tiny chasms collapsing in on themselves. The pain in them isn’t just anger or sorrow; it’s deeper, older, as if my mistake has peeled back time itself to reveal every wound I never knew I’d caused.  

I try to speak, but my voice is caught in my throat like a swallowed scream. The sound that escapes instead is distorted, warped—a broken apology carried away by an unseen wind. My hands reach for them, fingers curling as though gathering the fragments of what I’ve shattered, but the space between us stretches impossibly, a yawning void filling with whispering echoes of words I should have said.  

And then I realize—the ground beneath *them* is different. Cracks spread like veins, darkness oozing up from between the splintered pieces, pulling them down. I lunge forward, but I’m sinking too. The air is syrup-thick, dragging at my limbs, my breath. Their fingers twitch, reaching back—not in anger, but in quiet despair—before the world tilts violently.  

I wake in a gasp, the afterimage of that look still burned behind my eyelids. The room is cold. My chest aches. And somewhere, just beyond the edges of waking, I swear I still hear the whisper of my own name—not angry, not forgiving, just *there*, waiting.
