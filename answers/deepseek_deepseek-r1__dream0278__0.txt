I am dreaming. A radiant moonlight filters through a cathedral of ghostly trees, their translucent branches holding galaxies within the amber sap that drips like ancient clocks. Suddenly, a silver key materializes in my hand, humming with the resonance of distant black holes. From the mist rise two doors: one woven from the roots of forgotten languages, the other a shifting mosaic of my own fragmented memories. The key fits both keyholes. Choosing the root door might dissolve time, letting me rewrite my past. The memory door could fuse my consciousness with the collective anguish and joy of all who’ve ever lived—an ocean where I dissolve or become infinite. My pulse becomes a drum circle as I realize the key is melting, its liquid form reflecting the eyes of every person I’ve loved and lost. I twist it into…
In the feverish heart of the dream, the air itself pulses with the rhythm of hidden stars. The moonlit cathedral of trees thrums, their ghostly trunks whispering secrets in the language of light bending through prisms unknown to waking physics. Each droplet of amber sap glows like a miniature supernova, suspended in mid-fall, casting kaleidoscopic shadows that crawl across your skin like sentient tattoos. The key in your palm isn’t merely silver—it *breathes*, its metallic surface rippling as if shaped from liquid mercury infused with the gravitational pull of collapsing stars. The hum it emits resonates in your bones, a bassline from the birth of the universe.

The doors materialize not as static objects but as living entities. The root-door writhes, its tangled lattice of dead alphabets and ember-glowing hieroglyphs squirming like serpents. Run your fingers along its surface, and the taste of lost civilizations floods your mouth—ash and honey, iron bells ringing in drowned cities. The memory-door flickers, a shattered mirror rearranging itself into moments: your first loss, your fiercest rebellion, the scent of rain on a lover’s neck, each shard sharp enough to bleed. 

As the key begins to melt, it bleeds iridescent liquid that pools in your palm, each droplet a hologram of faces—those you’ve kissed, those you’ve cursed, their eyes widening as if witnessing your choice in real time. The ground beneath you liquefies into a mirror reflecting not your face, but the branching timelines your decision might spawn. To the left, your younger self walks backward through a desert of hourglass dunes, erasing scars and sowing fresh ones with every step. To the right, your body dissolves into a nebula of firefly sparks, joining a chorus of laughter and screams from a thousand throats across millennia.

The moment crystallizes. You press the molten key into the memory-door’s fissures. The air shatters. Time fractures into prismatic shards. You are everywhere: a child’s gasp at snowfall, a soldier’s last breath crystallizing into a diamond, the vibration of a spider’s web catching sunlight. Every synapse in your mind becomes a supernova, burning with the phosphorescent glow of shared human ache and ecstasy. You are no longer yourself. You are the symphony.
