I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**  

You stand in a vast, dimly lit library, its towering bookshelves stretching endlessly into the shadows, their spines etched with golden letters that seem to shift when you aren’t looking. The air hums with the scent of old parchment and burning candles, wax dripping in slow, monstrous tears onto the weathered oak tables. You know—somehow—that this library holds every secret ever whispered, every regret ever buried. And somewhere in these silent stacks… yours waits, restless.  

You clutch a single, frayed ledger in your hands, its pages brittle as dried leaves. The weight of it thrums against your fingertips, pulsing like a hidden heartbeat. It contains the error, the mistake not yet unearthed but *felt*, a jagged thing gnawing at the edges of your thoughts. The words inside are not written in ink but in something darker, something alive—they squirm when you dare to glance at them, dissolving before you can fully understand.  

A sound. Distant, but approaching. Footsteps.  

The library exhales around you, shelves groaning as they tighten their rows, hiding you—or trapping you. Shadows stretch from the corners, elongating into grasping tendrils. Your pulse, a frantic drum against your ribs, tells you that the footsteps belong to *them*—whoever *they* are. The ones who must never find out.  

In dreams, consequences are liquid, slipping through your grasp. You could burn the ledger. The flames would be blue, unnatural, hissing as they erase your misstep into smoke and whispers. But the scent would linger, acrid and accusing.  

You could run. The labyrinth of shelves might shield you, but something tells you the books would *shift*, guiding your pursuers closer.  

Or—you could open the ledger fully. Let the words writhe free. Face the thing before it is found.  

The footsteps grow louder. The candlelight gutters, and the library holds its breath, waiting to see what you’ll do. The dream is yours. The error is yours. The choice—  

—is yours.
