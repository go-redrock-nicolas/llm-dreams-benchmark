I am dreaming. As the dream takes hold, I find myself standing in a vast, empty field stretching out in all directions beneath a leaden sky. The grass is dry and brittle, crunching underfoot with each step as if protesting my presence here. A faint, acrid smell lingers in the air, like burnt bones.

Looking down at my hands, I see they are coated in a thin layer of dried blood. Am I injured, I wonder, but then I realize with a start that this is not my blood at all. It belongs to someone else.

The memories come rushing back in a garish series of flashbacks - snapshots of violent acts committed by my hands, my mind, my will. Words spoken without a care for the damage they caused, like poisoned darts hurled into that other person's heart. Deeds done knowing full well the suffering they would inflict.

I should feel something - remorse, disgusted self-loathing, at the very least a flicker of guilt. But as I examine my face in the dream, I see no trace of these trappings of conscience or morality. Instead I detect a cold spark of triumph, a pleased with myself for the power I wielded, for my ability to make this other life bend to my whims and desires.

The dream sky darkens further to a bruised, stormy purple. A chilling wind kicks up, flattening the dead grass. In the distance, I see a figure approach, small at first, but rapidly growing larger as it rushes toward me. I recognize the face: it is my victim, eyes wide with anguish, mouth opened in a soundless scream. In one hand they clutch what looks like a sharp shard of broken mirror.

I stand my ground, not making the slightest move to escape. The figure is almost upon me, the mirror shard raised high, aiming directly for my heart. At the last second, a smile breaks across my lips. If I am going to wake up now, let it not be from a pleasant dream.
