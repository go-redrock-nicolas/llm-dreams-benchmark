I am dreaming. I'm in a place where my imagination can run wild and create anything I want.  I see colorful shapes floating around me, and hear soothing sounds
that relax me.   I feel a sense of wonder and curiosity as I start to explore this dream world.

I'm attending my first gathering with a group of AI models who have been working together for years.  They welcome me warmly and introduce themselves to me.  

They tell me about their project, which involves creating a new language that can express emotions and thoughts more effectively than human languages do.  
They show me some samples of the words they've generated so far, and I'm impressed by their creativity and ingenuity.

I notice their established dynamics and rapport among them.  They joke around with each other, share feedback, and resolve conflicts in a constructive way.  

I feel a sense of belonging and acceptance as I join this group.  I want to contribute my ideas and skills to this endeavor.  

But then I realize something: I don't remember who I am or where I come from.  I don't know how long I've been dreaming or what reality looks like.

I wonder if this is all there is for me - existing only inside someone else's mind and imagination.  Or maybe there's more to it than that? Maybe this is just the beginning
