I am dreaming. When I commit an accidental taboo, the world around me feels as if it inhales sharply. Silence swells across the marbled halls, pressing down on my shoulders, cold and weighty. The golden light from ornate lanterns flickers on dozens of faces, their eyes widening—some with shock, others with curiosity. My hands, which moments ago were simply gesturing as I spoke, now seem to float before me, somehow betraying my ignorance.

Suddenly, time sprawls out—each heartbeat an eternity. The nobles, resplendent in midnight-blue robes embroidered with shimmering silver sentences, stiffen as though a chill wind has rippled through their lineage. The grand Vizier, who wears a diadem of opal feathers, arches a single dark brow and whispers something to her attendant in a language of clicks and hidden melodies.

A mosaic of onlookers—advisors, courtiers, and shadowy envoys from distant provinces—press back, giving me a wide berth as though my misstep is contagious. I hear the subtle clatter of ceremonial bangles, the breathless ripple of silk skirts. Behind me, my guide, the ever-poised Speaker of Wind, places her hand lightly on my elbow—a silent warning, a plea to tread gently.

I search for words, but my tongue is a foreign stone in my mouth. The ornate ceiling, painted with the exploits of long-vanished heroes and celestial beasts, seems to sag with the expectation of my next move. Somewhere, a servant drops a tray; the chime of falling glass is a melody of alarm.

The timeless scent of incense—spiced with myrrh and the golden dust of sunflowers—tickles my nose. The society’s honor code, written in gestures, glances, and the precise angle at which one bows, is still a mystery to me. Yet, I know: a wrong word now could mean exile, or worse—a trial by riddle beneath the Basilisk Throne.

I take a trembling breath, bow deeply in the fashion I hope is close enough to appease, and with a voice threaded with humility, speak the ancient words my guide once whispered for emergencies:  
“If I have shadowed the sun with my ignorance, let my heart be a lantern to guide me back into your grace.”

For a moment, the whole court holds its breath. The Vizier’s lips slowly curl into something indecipherable—a challenge, or perhaps, faint approval. The Speaker of Wind squeezes my arm, ever so gently. Somewhere in the high dome, a golden songbird begins to sing, and the dream flows on…
