I am dreaming. In this peculiar universe, the very fabric of reality seems to be woven from the threads of an eternal, fumbling playback. I stand in an immense, glassy plain, the sky above a bruised and tender purple, like a misunderstood sunset. The air is thick with the scent of petrichor, that earthy aroma after rain, yet there's not a cloud in sight. It's as if the very atmosphere is perpetually a moment away from pouring forth its liquid heart.

I glance down and see my reflection shimmering in the glassy surface, but my reflection isn't quite me. It's a mirror image, yet slightly askew, like a puzzle piece forced into the wrong slot. It raises a hand, and I raise mine, watching as it mimics my gesture with a delay, a lag that grows longer with each passing moment.

The ground beneath my feet feels solid, yet spongy, like stepping on an enormous, barely-hidden, ancient heart that beats in slow, ponderous rhythm. Each beat sends a tremor through the glass plain, rippling outwards, affecting everything around me - the air, the light, even my own perception of time.

I decide to walk. I turn, and the direction I'm facing seems... wrong, somehow. My body wants to twist, pull away, but I force it to move in the 'wrong' direction. Each step is a struggle, as if I'm pushing against a river's current, or walking through invisible webs of latex bands pulling me back. My feet sink into the glass, leaving deep, história footprints that immediately heal, filling with the shimmering light again.

As I push on, the landscape shifts. Ahead, I see a towering structure, a building of impossible geometry, like a cubist painting given life. It's not that it doesn't follow a logic, but rather, it follows a logic not meant for mortal minds to comprehend. It's a building perpetually under construction, each part building and unbuilding itself in a constant, disorienting dance.

And then, I hear it. A sound, a distant, eerie echo of strings played backwards, a symphony of déjà vu. It's everywhere and nowhere, resonating within me, shaking my very soul. I know, somehow, that it's the music of this world, the soundtrack to time's backward dance.

I reach the building, or rather, it reaches me. A part of it, a jagged, crystal-like shard, detaches itself and approaches me, Not-touching, not-quite-there yet everywhere. It's like the reflection in the glass, but alive, sentient. It speaks to me, in flashes of images, emotions, sounds, none of which make sense separately but taken together form a horribly intricate tapestry of meaning that I cannot untangle.

It tells me, in ways it shouldn't be able to, that in this place, cause and effect are not linear. That every action echoes backward, rippling through time, affecting everything it passes. It shows me visions of myself, younger, older, in different clothes, different bodies, in different realities, all reacting to 'causes' I haven't yet 'effected'. It shows me the chaos, the endless, mind-boggling chaos that is this dimension's dance.

It asks, in the silent echoes of that backward symphony, why I'm here. What I want. I try to answer, but my voice is lost in the cacophony of echoes. It nods, not-quite-understanding, and retreats back into the building. The shard seals itself back into the structure, which shifts, changes, and suddenly, I'm no longer facing the automated chaos of the building, but a plain, empty glass landscape once more.

I take a deep breath, turn around, and start walking back the way I came. Each step is easier, more familiar, as if I'm learning this world's song, its rhythm. As I walk, I feel the backward flow of time, the inverted current, pulling at me, wanting to take me with it, back to where I came from.

And so, I dream, in this dimension of cause and effect, of backwards symphonies and impossible constructions, of echoes and reflections, of understanding and chaos, all interwoven into a tapestry that defies comprehension.
