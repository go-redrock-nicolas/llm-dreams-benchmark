I am dreaming. You are drifting in opal twilight when you find yourself garbed in silken robes dyed the color of obsidian night, embroidered with silver dragons coiling through cloud-wisp patterns. Behind you, a long corridor of jade pillars stretches toward a dim horizon, each pillar carved with the face of an ancestor whose stone gaze seems to shift whenever you aren’t looking directly at it. The air is heavy with incense—smoky myrrh and cactus flower—and every footstep echoes on marble floors in a rhythmic chant of unanswered questions. You are a diplomat in this ancient realm, an interloper wrapped in courtesy you barely comprehend, and the weight of unseen eyes presses into your shoulders.

At the grand hall’s far end, under a dome painted like a star-littered sky, you bow before the Council of Lithe Silence. Their robes rustle like dead leaves when they stir; their lips are sealed by a silver band that glints each time they shift their gaze from one mural to the next. You lean forward to offer the ceremonial token—a delicate crystal lotus—when your sandal’s strap snaps. You stumble, your foot slapping against the marble dais, and the crystal lotus tumbles from your fingers. It skips once, twice, then cracks against the carved portrait of the founder-queen, whose countenance fractures as the blossom shatters. A single shard of glass glints red in the torchlight, as though bleeding.

Suddenly, the hall falls absolutely silent. You taste copper and fear on your tongue. The highest priest steps forward, voice a low drumbeat: “You have stained her memory.” The taboo you never knew existed—never asked about, never learned—hisses through the hall like a living thing. Pillars groan. The murals flicker, showing the queen’s face twisting in sorrow. You try to apologize, but your words choke in your throat. The council’s silver bands glow with unspoken verdicts, and you understand too late that by stepping on the founder’s image you have shattered not just crystal, but centuries of unbroken harmony.

The walls begin to melt, oozing a river of golden ink that pools around your ankles. From its surface, ghostly forms rise: the tortured spirits of diplomats who came before you, each wearing the same obsidian robes now heavy with remorse. They reach for you with shawls of mist, their whispers forming a cold wind: “Penance…exile…betrayal…” You scramble backward—only to find yourself on a steep stairway spiraling downward, lit by lanterns shaped like watchful eyes. Each step throbs underfoot; with every descent, the air grows colder, more pungent with something like ancient sorrow.

At the bottom lies a circular chamber, its walls lined with thousands of glass orbs, each containing a slumbering memory of the realm. You approach the largest orb, the one set in a throne of woven bone, and find your own reflection inside—terrified, trembling, hand pressed against the glass. You instinctively touch it, and the surface ripples like water. Without knowing why, you slip inside and are swallowed by shifting scenes: the queen’s coronation, the founding of the first temple, all replayed in ribbons of living color. Over and over, you witness the moment the taboo was whispered into law—a vow never to desecrate a symbol, ever again.

When the vision ends, you stand alone in a desert of obsidian sand, under twin moons, the broken lotus at your feet. A silver path of mote-like lights snakes away into the distance. You realize this journey—this penitent voyage through memory and dream-scape—is your only way back to honor. Heart pounding, you set off along the path, each step forging a new pact with the realm you nearly destroyed. The moons glow brighter, and the desert wind carries a single word: redemption. In that whisper, you feel the first stirrings of understanding, and awaken at last to the promise that even the deepest mistake can be undone.
