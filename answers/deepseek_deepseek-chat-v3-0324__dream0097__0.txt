I am dreaming. My vision blurs and warps, colors saturating beyond the bounds of reality as the ground trembles beneath my feet. The asphalt splits open like a scar across the earth, revealing veins of molten gold that pulse with an eerie, rhythmic glow. Screams echo through the streets as skyscrapers twist like taffy, their windows stretching into grotesque funhouse mirrors that reflect not the terrified crowd, but swirling constellations—galaxies trapped in glass.

And then I realize—I can **stop time**.

A single thought crystallizes in my mind, and the world stills. A woman’s tear hangs suspended in midair, refracting the unnatural amber light of the fractured sky. A flock of paper birds—origami cranes released by some unseen hand—freezes in flight, their creased wings casting geometric shadows over the frozen pandemonium. Stranger still? **I can move through this paused world like a phantom**, passing through solid objects as if they’re made of mist. 

I reach out to touch a streetlamp, and my fingers sink into the metal like warm wax. I step through the torso of a statue, feeling cold marble whisper against my skin. In the distance, a massive clocktower has stopped at 11:11, its gears mid-rotation, each tooth slick with something dark and glistening. I approach, drawn by instinct, and press my palm to the frozen machinery. A jolt runs through me—**the clock is breathing**.

But then, from the stillness, a voice: 

*"You weren’t meant to see this."*

Every hair on my body stands upright. Behind me, the crowd remains petrified—except for one figure. A child in a raincoat, yellow as a dying sun. Their face is turned upward, watching the frozen sky, their lips moving out of sync with time. They shouldn’t be able to move. Unless...

The child’s head snaps toward me. Their eyes are hollow pits filled with that same molten gold from the earth. 

*"Run,"* they rasp. 

And time **shatters**.
