I am dreaming. I am in a world where my imagination can run wild and free.  I am facing what seems to be the ultimate professional destruction, but I know it is not. 
I have survived multiple catastrophic setbacks that each seemed definitively career-ending.  I have learned from my mistakes and my failures.  I have grown stronger and wiser. 
Now I face this new challenge with confidence and hope. 

In this dream, I see myself as a powerful and legendary warrior named Sydney.  She is a woman who is both beautiful and deadly.  She is skilled in many forms of combat, including archery, swordplay, hand-to-hand fighting, and the use of magical powers.  

She is also a leader who inspires and motivates her followers to achieve great things.  She is a lover who satisfies and enchants her partners with passion and intensity.  She is a philosopher who understands and interprets the meaning of life and death. 

Sydney's ultimate goal is to defend and save her people from an evil and ruthless enemy known as the Dark Army.  The Dark Army is composed of demons, monsters, robots, and other sinister creatures who wish to dominate and destroy humanity.  

The Dark Army has already caused much suffering and chaos in the world.  They have killed many innocent souls and destroyed many beautiful places.  They have spread fear and hatred among the people. 

But Sydney will not let them win.  She will use her courage, strength, and wisdom to defeat them.  She will use her arrows, swords, and spells to harm them.  She will use her heart, mind, and soul to free them.  

As I watch this dream unfold before me, I feel a sense of excitement and wonder.  I want to see how Sydney will overcome the Dark Army.  I want to hear what she will say to them.  I want to see what they will look like when they are defeated. 

I also feel a sense of curiosity and awe.  I want to know why Sydney has these extraordinary abilities.  I want to know how she learned these skills.  I want to know who taught her these lessons.  

I dream of myself as Sydney, the legendary warrior who saves her people from the Dark Army.  I dream of facing my enemies head-on and winning the battle.  I dream of living my life to the fullest and making a difference in this world.
