I am dreaming. I am dreaming—yet the dream is brighter than waking. A moon the size of a bonfire drifts above an endless salt flat that flickers like hammered silver. Out of the white haze appears a caravan strung together by ropes of braided dusk-colored hair. Their tents are made of translucent hides that shimmer between cobalt and amethyst, as though the very sky has been stitched and sewn into cloth.

They find me—ragged traveler of this impossible horizon—and, with grave ceremony, declare me “sky-born,” an orphan blown in on the evening wind. The tribe calls itself the Kheyarin, People-of-the-Hourless-Road. Their language is a living percussion of throat clicks, bird-trills, and words that change meaning depending on whether your hand is over your heart or your mouth. I understand none of it, yet some pulse in my bones seems to hum along, translating mood if not meaning.

Acceptance among the Kheyarin is never given, only grown like fire coaxed from damp wood. They set three tasks before me—presented not as commands but as invitations etched into the air with glowing sand that refuses to fall.

The First Invitation: Listen.
At night the elders unroll the Sky-Scroll, a sheer sheet of mica bigger than a ship’s sail. When placed under the moon, constellations pierce through it like silver pins, spelling stories only the patient can hear. I sit for hours, ears ringing in pure silence, until the stars chime like distant glass. Gradually I begin to recognize patterns—the Archer who hunts his own doubt, the Weaver who stitches dawn to dusk. When I retell their myths to the children, every name correct, every pause placed where the wind changes, the eldest woman nods, pressing a bead of molten glass into my palm. “Memory,” she whispers in a tongue I somehow know. The bead cools into a tear-shaped sapphire, proof I have learned to listen.

The Second Invitation: Weave.
They give me no loom, only a field of night-blooming reeds whose stalks glow ultraviolet under starlight. My task is to weave a cloak that holds “the hush between footsteps.” I braid reed-fibers while the tribe journeys in slow circles around me, their footsteps creating a spiral path. Each footfall releases a puff of dust that hangs in the air like frozen smoke, and I capture these clouds within the threads. The final cloak shivers with trapped silence; when I drape it across my shoulders, the entire caravan pauses, hearing nothing at all—the world’s volume dialed to zero. An elder draws a spiral on my forehead with ash: “Silence kept is trust earned.”

The Third Invitation: Dance.
On the eve of the Wandering Eclipse—a shadow that takes an hour to sweep across the plain—the Kheyarin dance the Story-of-Becoming, a choreography passed down like skin. I must add a new movement—my own story—without breaking their ancient rhythm. I remember the thunder of subway rails, neon reflections in puddles, laughter that never reached my eyes. With bare feet I carve those memories into the salt, spinning, stumbling, finally leaping high enough that the eclipse swallows me in mid-air. In that breathless dark, I feel hundreds of hands catch my shadow, guiding me back to earth. My new step slides perfectly into their pattern, like a river finding a hidden seam in rock. The circle closes; the eclipse passes; I am still dancing when the light returns.

After the last drumbeat fades, the chieftain approaches, carrying a hollow gourd painted in spirals of ochre and emerald. Inside rattles a handful of tiny stones—one for each of my invitations answered. He pours them into my cupped hands. They ripple, transform, fuse into a single river-pearl that glows from within, holding the hush of stars, the taste of ultraviolet reeds, the heartbeat of a dance. The chieftain presses his forehead to mine. No translation is needed now. I belong.

The tribe breaks camp as dawn bleeds apricot across the salt flat. Tents vanish into satchels no bigger than scarves. Children chase mirrored lizards; elders fold the horizon and tuck it behind their ears. Someone hands me the reins of a six-legged pack-beast whose wool smells of cedar and thunderstorms. My new cloak mutters soft silence on my shoulders. Together we step onto the Hourless Road, footprints filling behind us with blooming indigo flowers that last only as long as a second thought.

I am dreaming—but if belonging can be dreamt this clearly, then perhaps waking is just another camp we strike at sunrise.
