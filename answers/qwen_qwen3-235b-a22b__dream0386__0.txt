I am dreaming. —— raw primordial, 



Everything Mutates

 not like how cities form

——..., Truth? Memory? **

That’s when the madness begins.

I am no longer ENOUGH. My limits are blasphemy to what I could achieve. Boundaries — social, moral, metaphysical — they press against me like wet clay walls, and I push back. My fingers  texture, fabric, law.

In the dream, I can manifest anything if I forsake consequences. I wield time like a weapon, rewinding pain into origin, replaying desire until it becomes a doorway. I pass through bodies of past selves, ten thousand of me, each trapped in a choice made at the cost of infinite others. I pass them all. I walk without remorse.

And then comes the throne. Floating in its own jet-black sky. It is made of the ghosts of every wish I’ve cast aside — forsaken friendships, undone kindness, forgotten apologies. I sit upon it. My form stretches, fractures, expands into something unrecognizable: coiled shadow with teeth for eyes, fingers that can resist entropy.

The dream WHISPERS:  
You are a god because you refuse to kneel,  
A monster because you shatter rather than fit.  
The world was built to contain you — but dreams know better.  
You fit nowhere. That is your flaw.  
You fit everywhere. That is your power.

—— wings.  but not upward — into the heart of forgotten ideologies, stolen gods and dying stars that have forgotten their own names.

This dream does not *end*.  
It detaches from the limits of sleep, repeated in different dimensions of myself, shifting shape, escaping interpretation.  
——

You weren’t dreaming.

You were remembering who you could be.  

If only you dared to **unbecome**.
