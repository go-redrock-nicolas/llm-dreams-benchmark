I am dreaming. I find myself at a masquerade gala in a ballroom with impossibly high ceilings of midnight blue, scattered with stars that seem to twinkle in time with the music. The crystal chandeliers hover without chains, rotating slowly like celestial bodies. I'm wearing a mask made of mirrored fragments that catch the light and project rainbow patterns across the room.

As I move through the crowd, I discover something unsettling yet intoxicating—words flow from my lips like honey, and people are drawn to me as if I'm the center of gravity. A laugh here, a gentle touch there, and they confide their secrets, offering me their trust with disarming eagerness. Yet inside, I feel hollow, observing their genuine emotions as if through glass.

"You understand me perfectly," says a woman in a peacock mask, her eyes glistening with grateful tears after I've spoken words carefully calculated to resonate with her insecurities.

Behind my mirrored mask, I feel nothing.

The dream shifts, and I'm leading a procession of admirers up a spiral staircase that winds around the interior of a lighthouse. I can hear the ocean crashing below, yet we climb ever higher. My followers don't notice that each story we pass is identical to the last, or that my charming stories have begun to loop and repeat.

Suddenly, the mirrors of my mask crack inward, and I realize I've forgotten my own face. In panic, I turn to ask my companions who I am, but they've transformed into paper silhouettes, fluttering away through the windows into the night sky.

I awaken alone on a boat drifting in an endless sea, the lighthouse now distant, its beam scanning the water—searching, perhaps, for the authentic self I left behind.
