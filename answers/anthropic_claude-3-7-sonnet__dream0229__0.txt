I am dreaming. I drift through luminous mist that parts to reveal a city unlike any I've seen—crystalline spires that catch the light of two pale suns, reflecting prisms across alabaster paths where people glide rather than walk. Their faces strike me immediately: serene to the point of radiance, eyes clear as mountain pools, expressions unmarred by worry or pain. The air tastes of honeysuckle and something metallic I cannot name.

A woman approaches, her movements fluid as water over stone. "Welcome, traveler," she says, voice melodious yet somehow lacking certain emotional textures. "You've arrived at Harmonia, where suffering has been conquered." She extends her hand—pale, perfect, without calluses or scars—and invites me to follow.

As we journey deeper, I witness their miracle: citizens connected by gossamer neural threads to a central crystalline structure they call "The Equilibrium." When someone begins to experience grief, the network redistributes the emotional burden until it's imperceptible. Physical pain is intercepted before consciousness registers it. Anxiety is dissolved through instantaneous chemical adjustments.

"Would you like to join us?" the woman asks, offering a silver circlet. "The integration is painless—ironically, the last discomfort you'll ever feel."

But I notice troubling details: art galleries filled with technically perfect yet strangely hollow creations. Musicians playing without passion. Lovers embracing with peaceful affection but none of the beautiful desperation of true desire. Children who've never known the growth that follows failure.

The ethical dilemma crushes against my chest—a society that has eliminated suffering by eliminating the full spectrum of human experience. The depth has gone from their eyes; they've traded the vibrant tapestry of existence for a perfect, flat painting of it.

As the circlet hovers before me, I feel the weight of choice. Would I surrender the exquisite ache of loss that makes joy meaningful? The struggle that gives triumph its sweetness?

The mist begins to swirl around me again, and I realize my answer matters more than I could possibly know.
