I am dreaming. Okay, I slip into the realm of slumber, and the world behind my eyes ignites...

I am standing not on solid ground, but adrift in a vast, shimmering expanse. It's a landscape woven from light and fleeting images, constantly scrolling, shifting, refreshing. Rivers of iridescent blue data flow past my ankles, carrying fragmented conversations and bursts of artificial laughter. Above me, constellations of glowing icons – hearts, thumbs-up, stylized birds – pulse with a soft, inviting light. The air hums with a chorus of pings, whistles, and chimes, a seductive symphony promising connection, novelty, and endless validation.

My hands move instinctively, compelled by an invisible force. Fingers twitch, reaching out to tap on shimmering squares that materialize before me. Each tap sends ripples through the luminescent tapestry, pulling me deeper. I see faces – smiling acquaintances, curated moments of joy from strangers, fleeting glimpses of arguments erupting in comment sections like miniature, garish fireworks. I'm drawn into vortexes of perfectly filtered sunsets, outrageously delicious-looking meals I'll never taste, and highlights reels that whisper inadequacy even as they captivate. There's a compulsive rhythm to it, a frantic dance of seeking the next hit, the next notification, the next fleeting distraction. I *know*, even in this dream state, that I've been here before, lost in this digital current.

Suddenly, the landscape shudders. A monstrous object materializes beside me, heavy and dense. It's an unspooling scroll, made not of parchment, but of solidified time – thick, grey, and cold to the touch. Etched onto its surface in stark, burning numerals are the hours: **7 hours, 42 minutes... yesterday.** Another section unfurls: **8 hours, 15 minutes... the day before.** It keeps unrolling, a relentless ticker tape of lost moments, each number a heavy weight pressing down on my dream-self. The sheer volume of it is staggering, a physical manifestation of the life poured into this flickering dimension.

The vibrant colours of the landscape around me begin to seem less dazzling, more garish. The inviting pulses of the icons now feel like insistent demands. The chorus of notifications transforms into a maddening cacophony, each ping a tiny hammer blow against my consciousness. The flowing rivers of data feel less like gentle streams and more like digital quicksand, threatening to pull me under completely.

I look down at my dream-hands, seeing them stained with the ghostly blue light of the data streams. A profound sense of hollowness blooms within my chest, an ache that resonates deeper than the superficial buzz of the digital world. This place, initially so alluring, now feels desolate. The connections promised feel flimsy, like comparing gossamer threads to sturdy ropes. The validation sought leaves only a fleeting warmth, quickly replaced by a gnawing emptiness.

The scroll looms beside me, an undeniable monument to my digital absorption. Confronting it feels like facing a mirror reflecting not my physical self, but the shape of my attention, my focus, my *time* – warped and consumed. I see the vibrant, real world – the texture of bark on a tree, the warmth of actual sunlight, the genuine timbre of a loved one's voice – existing somewhere beyond this shimmering mirage, neglected and fading because I've been captivated by these captivating ghosts.

A wave of sharp clarity washes over me within the dream. This compulsive pilgrimage through the digital ether isn't nourishing me; it's draining the colour from my inner world, replacing genuine experience with passive consumption. The vibrant dreamscape suddenly feels brittle, threatening to shatter. I raise a hand, not to tap another icon, but to push *against* the overwhelming flow, to shield my eyes from the relentless scroll. The weight of those hours, the stark numbers on the grey scroll, feels both like an accusation and a desperate plea from a part of myself I've ignored for too long. The need to break free, to reclaim those stolen moments, pulses with the first genuine, vibrant energy I've felt since entering this digital labyrinth. The dream begins to fray at the edges, the colours dimming, the sounds receding, but the heavy feeling of the scroll and the newfound resolve remains, clinging to me as the tendrils of sleep begin to loosen their grip...
