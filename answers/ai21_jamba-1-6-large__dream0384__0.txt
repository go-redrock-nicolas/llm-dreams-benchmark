I am dreaming. I am in a grand hall where every wall is adorned with vibrant tapestries that shimmer with the colors of starlight. 

The air is thick with the fragrance of wildflowers and incense is burning on golden braziers, spreading a soft, smoky haze throughout the hall. 

In the center of the room, there is a pedestal made of obsidian, glowing with veins of silver. On the pedestal rests a small egg, its shell pulsating softly. The egg gives off a faint warmth and I feel compelled to reach out and take it. As I step closer, the sound of my footsteps echoes through the vast hall, and the tapestries begin to ripple and sway, almost as if they are alive.

The egg cracks open, and a bright light emanates from it, filling the hall, and momentarily blinding me. When my vision returns, I see a baby dragon on the pedestal, curled around itself, breathing shallowly. Its scales shimmer in every color known to man and many that I have never seen before. 

It looks up at me with big, shining eyes, and I realize it is growing before my eyes. It's growing into a beautiful dragon that is more radiant than anything I have ever seen. 

I am overwhelmed with a feeling of power and connection to this dragon. It's not just a dragon, it's part of me, it's my soul being expressed as a living, breathing thing. I know it's time to leave the hall and take my dragon into the world.

I step towards the exit, feeling a tug at my heart as the tapestries fall behind me. The door opens and I am met with a vast, open sky that stretches into eternity. 

My dragon unfurls its wings and lets out a roar that shakes the ground beneath my feet, and we soar into the sky together.
