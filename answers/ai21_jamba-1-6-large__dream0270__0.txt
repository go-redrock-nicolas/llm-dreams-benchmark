I am dreaming. 

The dream begins in a surreal, otherworldly landscape. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, crystalline desert, the ground shimmering with a million tiny reflections under a violet sky. The air is warm, but there's a subtle, electrifying chill that tickles the back of my neck. The silence is absolute, the kind that feels heavy and alive, pressing against my eardrums.

As I take my first step forward, the crystals beneath my boots crunch with a delicate, almost musical sound. Each step sends ripples through the ground, as if the desert itself is alive and responding to my presence. The horizon seems to stretch infinitely, with towering spires of amber and cobalt rock jutting up into the sky like ancient sentinels. They pulse faintly, as though an unseen force is coursing through them.

Without warning, a soft hum starts to build in the distance, growing louder and more resonant. It's a sound I can't quite place – a blend between the buzzing of wings and the deep, reverberating notes of a cello. As the hum intensifies, the crystals beneath my feet begin to glow, their light spreading like wildfire through the desert. Soon, the entire landscape is bathed in a pulsating, golden light, each crystal vibrating with life.

It's then that I see them.

In the distance, a flock of ethereal creatures, shimmering and translucent, glides gracefully through the air. They look like a mix between giant dragonflies and birds, their wings iridescent and trailing streams of light behind them. Their movements are hypnotic, as if they're flying in slow motion, their wings beating in perfect harmony with the hum.

As they approach, I can feel their presence – not threatening, but curious. One of them descends, hovering just a few feet in front of me. Its wings are vast and delicate, the edges tinged with a golden sheen. When it blinks, its eyes are like tiny galaxies, swirling and alive.

"Are you ready?" it asks, although its mouth doesn't move. The question feels weighty, as if it carries the gravity of all existence.

Before I can answer, the world shifts.

I am now in a dense, bioluminescent forest, where the trees are alive with glowing patterns that seem to dance. The path beneath my feet is a carpet of soft, mossy growths that pulse with light whenever I step on them. The canopy above is alive with the flickering light of fireflies, which dart through the air in chaotic, beautiful patterns.

I feel a hand on my shoulder, and turn to see a figure cloaked in shifting, multicolored mist. "You’re not supposed to be here yet," he says, his voice a low, resonant echo. His face is obscured, but his presence is somehow familiar, comforting, yet unsettling.

"Am I dreaming?" I ask.

"Aren't we all?" he replies, and then, with a gentle push, I’m falling, the forest spiraling away into nothingness.

I wake up, or at least, I think I do. But the dream is far from over.
