I am dreaming. I am adopted into a traditional family from a culture completely foreign to me.  The sights, sounds, and smells are all new and overwhelming as I navigate the bustling streets of the vibrant city. The cacophony of voices speaking in a language that I don't understand washes over me.

My new family is loving, and try their best to help me understand their customs and traditions. The matriarch of the family, a vibrant woman with bright eyes and a warm smile, takes me under her wing.

As I explore my new surroundings, I am struck by the beauty of the architecture. The buildings are a riot of colors, and the intricate carvings and decorations on every surface are breathtaking.

I am introduced to new foods that I have never seen or heard of before. The spices tingle on my tongue, the flavors complex and delicious. Every meal is a new adventure, and I relish in the opportunity to try new things.

My new family celebrates a festival that is completely foreign to me. The streets are filled with people dressed in vibrant clothing, dancing to the rhythm of drums and other instruments. The air is thick with the scent of incense and spices. I am swept up in the energy of the celebration.

As I become more comfortable with my new family and surroundings, I begin to understand and even appreciate the traditions and customs that were once so foreign to me. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to experience this new culture, and I feel a deep connection to my new family.

As my dream comes to an end, I am left with a sense of wonder and a newfound appreciation for the beauty and diversity of the world around me. I wake up feeling refreshed and inspired, grateful for the incredible journey that I just experienced in my dreams.
