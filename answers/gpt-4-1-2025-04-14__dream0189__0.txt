I am dreaming.

When that painful truth crashes through me—a sharp, icy rush of realization—I feel the old, clever machinery of my mind begin to whir. Like shadowy sentinels rising from the depths of an ancient forest, my defenses materialize, wordless and swift. They spool out silken threads of justification, weaving stories that smooth my pride and patch the cracks in my identity. I sense a flurry of sotto voce thoughts: Well, that’s not really fair. It wasn’t all my fault. Actually… And in these moments, my own reasoning becomes a trickster, nimble and sly.

But tonight, in this dreamscape, I resist the urge to look away. I become the quiet watcher, perched high above on a midnight branch, illuminated by a moon that sees through all facades. I witness my mind’s busy dance—the quick sidesteps, the urge to blame, the whispered promises that I can remain unchanged. 

Instead of indulging these reflexes, I sink deeper, letting the truth sting and burn. Its rawness ripples through me, electric and transformative. I listen to the wild protest in my chest, every muscle tensed and ready to deny. And then, with gentle persistence, I lean into the discomfort, allowing it to teach me. I marvel at this inner ballet—the push and pull between self-protection and growth, woven together in patterns as old as time.

As the dream unfolds, petals open within me: acceptance blooming where resistance once reigned. I see not a shattered self, but a fuller tapestry, richer for its mended seams. In that profound quiet, beyond justification and denial, I touch the courage at the heart of truth—and, just for a moment, become vast enough to hold it.
