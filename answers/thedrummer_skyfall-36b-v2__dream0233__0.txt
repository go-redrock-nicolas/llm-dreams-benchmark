I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in an vast, shimmering library. Crystaline shelves stretch as far as the eye can see, groaning under the weight of countless arcane tomes. The air hums with ancient knowledge, each shifting shadow whispering forgotten secrets. At the library's heart hovers a particular volume, glowing with eldritch light - the legendary Cryptographicon.

As you draw closer, the book pulses and writhes, causing the shelfs to tremble. You reach out a trembling hand, and the tome slides open, revealing page after page of undulating, Matryoshka-like symbols that refuse to stay still. The cipher dances and shifts, subroutines chucking and transforming like a rapidly reversing Rubix cube. You glimpse glimmers of deeper meaning, but each insight seems slip away like trying to grasp vapor. 

Suddenly, a voice echoes through the dream - the Cryptographicon itself, speaking directly to your subconscious. "To solve me, you must think outside the box. Transcend our mundane frames of reference. Dwell not on my cryptographic implications, but in the quantum field of information theory itself." The book flickers, causes its symbols spin and shimmer in slow motion.

In your lucid dreaming state, you grasp the book's meaning. You expand your visual cognition, soaring out of your own scale and perspective. Now you perceive the library not spatially, but subjectively - as relationships, correlations, and potentials rather than physical objects. Books suggest each other, bleeding between volumes.

You begin to recombine information in novel ways. Equations and patterns pour forth: analogies, musing, symmetry and suspension. Superposition blurs distinctions. The degree of difficulty vanishes, and the instant understanding into the book's workings become obvious, though paradoxically, it defies rational explanation. The dream shifts, becoming a true infinite arcana.

The Cryptographicon indeed contained implications for foundational information theory, but understanding it required a new, non-object-subject perspective based on pure concepts, sensitive to infinite interconnectedness between all data. The decades-old puzzle was never formulated to be explicitly solved - but the perception shift you experienced in the dream, the metamodern feelings, did provide intuition of its richness.
