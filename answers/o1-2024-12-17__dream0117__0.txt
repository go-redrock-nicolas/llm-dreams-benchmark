I am dreaming. …keep your chin high, heart pounding like distant thunder, and mind racing with frantic possibilities. You try to steady your breathing. There’s an hourglass in your dream—an ornate silver stand holding a vessel of swirling white sand that measures your final moments of calm before catastrophe. You feel each granule slip through your consciousness, every second tinged with the bittersweet flavor of urgency and despair.

You’re standing in a city that seems to have been painted in shimmering watercolor: tall towers that fade into the sun-bleached sky, rooftops covered in spectral gardens that sway in a nonexistent breeze, windows reflecting pools of molten gold. Every street you turn onto brims with life—vendors calling out their wares in sing-song voices, children chasing after glowing soap bubbles that never burst, pedestrians strolling through swirling mists of jasmine-scented air. 

But as you raise your voice above the murmur, warning them—all of them—that destruction is creeping closer with each pulse of your heart, the crowd turns away. Their laughter rustles through the air with a carefree melody, as though they’ve heard an insignificant jest. The tension builds in your temples; you feel that if you exhale any louder, the entire city might fracture into shards of glass.

You sprint between the twisting alleyways, searching for just one person who might heed your pleas. Perhaps the fortune-teller in the shadowy stall who interprets dreams through the shape of drifting feathers? Or the scholar perched under the banyan tree, nose buried in ancient scrolls? Desperation guides your steps like an invisible hand, pushing you forward. Yet every response you receive is a dismissive wave, a melancholic headshake, a pitiful smile—as though you’re a wandering dreamer lost in your own illusions.

Time is not on your side. Each minute that passes, you hear the soft clink of the hourglass’ sand shifting. You feel the city grow brighter, unbearably radiant as though the sun has moved closer to the earth. Open courtyards burst with dazzling blossoms, fountains sparkle in every shade of the rainbow, and kaleidoscopic birds cut swirls into the air, trailing glittering feathers that cascade onto the cobblestones below. The beauty is overwhelming. You want to cry out, to beseech these people to open their eyes, to take shelter, to prepare for whatever is coming. No one hears. Or perhaps, no one is willing to hear.

As the final ten minutes approach, you pause in the center of a grand plaza. There’s an ancient clock tower looming above, pale marble inscribed with cryptic runes that glint in the sunlight. But when you look up, you see the slender minute hand trembling forward, second by second. Each movement echoes in your chest. The hour of destruction is nearly upon you, and still, the city teems with gentle laughter and oblivious smiles. It’s surreal to witness such vibrant joy on the cusp of calamity.

You inhale the humid air and close your eyes, forcing yourself to remain calm. A gentle breeze stirs your hair and tickles the back of your neck. You think: Perhaps they’re trapped in this dream, as you are, and simply cannot recognize the signs. Perhaps they hear your warning but can’t fathom that this realm of ethereal wonder might crumble to dust in a single heartbeat.

Swallowing your frustration, you steel yourself. Despite the looming end—whatever shape it will take—you won’t succumb to hopelessness. Instead, you whisper a silent vow that if this dream city must face a cataclysm, you will stand at its center, unyielding. You take a deep breath, remembering the hourglass. If the catastrophe must come, if no one will heed your words, at least you will be there, steady and prepared, ready to comfort and protect whomever you can in the final moments—ready to embrace the swirling chaos, even if it consumes you.

And as the clock tower tolls the final chime, the last grain of sand tumbles through the hourglass—and you realize you are still dreaming, yet on the brink of something all too real, something that lurks just beyond the horizon. In that measured breath between awareness and oblivion, you stand resolute, determined to withstand whatever horrors may unfurl from this nightmarish harbinger of doom, determined to meet the end with open eyes and a steady soul.
