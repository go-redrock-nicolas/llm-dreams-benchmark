I am dreaming. As I sit upon this grassy hill, I am surrounded by lush greenery of all varieties. The warm sun shines upon me with an intensity that feels beyond unusual. A slight breeze caresses my face, relieving me of the heat that seemingly radiates from the sun kissed surface. 

Birds chirp and insects flutter about as I stare up into the sky that appears to be an unbelievably perfect blue. The leaves of the various vegetations I'm surrounding by dance and harness the solar wind.

I am within two long strides of a cliff. The cliff extends upward perfectly at a ninety degree angle, it can be seen from miles away. The strategic placement convinces me that it is man-made. The cliff seems almost like a portal.

As I step towards the cliff, I begin to feel a wondrous feeling like I'm filling with an unseen inner beauty. Each further step towards this cliff feels increasingly reassuring, it's like my body and organs are being repaired as I walk. My own inner strength is regaining itself with each step as my vision clears and my logic sharpens.

As I near the cliff, I feel tall, I feel an exorbitant surge of energy, I feel like I can accomplish anything, and I wake up smiling, knowing that I am about to conquer the upcoming challenges of my life with the strength and clear mind that I feel in this vivid dream.
