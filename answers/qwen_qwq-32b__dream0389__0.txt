I am dreaming. I can see myself in this dream, lying on my back in an open field that stretches as far as the eye can see. The grass beneath me ripples like liquid, shimmering in hues of green and gold that glow faintly under the silver light of a full moon. The air smells like rain and wildflowers, and the stars above twinkle with an almost human-like intelligence, winking down at me as if sharing a secret. 

Wait—someone is approaching. Their figure becomes clearer: a woman, or perhaps a celestial being, dressed in robes that shift from indigo to violet with every step. Her face is partly obscured by a veil, but her voice resonates in my chest when she speaks. "The shadow you see in others," she says, "is but a reflection of the light you fear losing within yourself." 

I feel a stir of jealousy, sharp and acidic, rising in my throat. It’s directed at the very personification of success standing before me. She notices my emotion and smiles, sadness warring with kindness in her eyes. "Jealousy is a mirror, my dear," she murmurs. "Look closer. What do you truly see?" 

The ground beneath me shifts; the field morphs into a vast library. Books up from the earth, their pages fluttering open like birds releasing secrets into the air. I walk between aisles lined with glowing manuscripts, each one a life story. One book pulses brighter than the others—it’s mine, I realize, its pages filled with half-written chapters and unfinished ideas. Beside mine stands a tome of polished obsidian, etched with flawless silver script: her story. 

Tears blur my vision as I reach for hers. The pages resist my touch, repelling my hands like magnets aligned incorrectly. "It cannot be taken," she says, beside me now. "But what if it could be woven?" She touches my book, and threads of starlight emerge from hers, stitching into my pages. The blank spaces fill with new possibilities, vibrant and untamed. 

"Success is not a fixed constellation," she explains, "but a living tapestry. Your jealousy is the thread that reminds you of your own potential—untouched, yearning for expression." The library dissolves into the field once more. The moon wanes, and dawn tinged with rose gold approaches. She fades, her final words echoing within me: "The brightest stars are born from the darkness they overcome."
