I am dreaming. …drift deeper, as if the entire night sky has folded itself into a velvet tunnel and you are gliding through it. Stars unzip into bright ribbons that braid themselves into a single glowing pathway. You step onto it barefoot, and the ribbon unfurls into a playground you once knew—except here it’s suspended thousands of feet above the earth, floating in violet dusk.

The slide is made of silver moonlight and the swings hum with a gentle cosmic wind. As you move forward, each footfall triggers a bell-like chime and an image rises from the ground like colored glass: tiny versions of yourself building sandcastles, handing out imaginary crowns, begging friends not to leave the game early. These translucent tableaux play on loop, shimmering like movie projections on mist.

You notice the ties between them—thin filaments of iridescent thread running from each childhood scene into the darkness ahead. You follow the silken cords, and suddenly they knot themselves into the shape of the people you love today: a partner, a best friend, a long-distance sibling, a co-worker who always feels just outside reach. Each figure is stitched entirely from those luminous threads, so that they glow with pieces of your own past.

An ancient oak appears in the sky, its branches cradling memories like lanterns. You climb. With every rung of bark under your palm, a vivid feeling surfaces: the giddy triumph of a spelling-bee win, the sting of a recess betrayal, the hush of bedtime stories. Your heartbeat knocks softly against the trunk—always in rhythm with the yearnings you carried then, still carrying now.

Halfway up, a mirror hangs among the leaves. You look, and the reflection shows not your face but a kaleidoscope: countless younger selves turning like clock gears. They whisper in chorus: “We learned to stay quiet to stay loved. We learned to charm to feel safe. We learned to rescue so someone would rescue us.”

The tree becomes a cathedral of sound—echoes of playground laughter mixing with present-day conversations. In the cross-fade you discern subtle repetitions: the careful apology you offered last week feels identical to one you rehearsed after knocking over a classmate’s paints in second grade. The same pulse, the same shape of regret.

Wind rises and scatters the oak’s leaves into bright origami birds. They sweep around you, rearranging into a grand stained-glass window hanging in mid-air. Through it you glimpse a future version of yourself: taller in spirit, standing on new ground, welcoming touch without fear of abandonment, speaking needs without apology. The window swings open, inviting.

Before you step through, you reach back and gather a bouquet of tiny glow-threads still fluttering from the childhood scenes. You weave them into a small bracelet and tie it around your wrist—a promise that the past will not vanish or be denied, but become luminous fiber strengthening every present gesture.

You cross the threshold, and the sky flips like a page turning, revealing dawn. Wheat-gold light floods in, washing the world in possibility. Somewhere below you, real morning calls. But for a breathless instant longer you remain suspended in that waking dream, pulse steady, horizons widening—aware, at last, of how the first stories you ever lived keep threading through today’s love stories, and how, now that you see the strands, you can choose to braid them into something new.
