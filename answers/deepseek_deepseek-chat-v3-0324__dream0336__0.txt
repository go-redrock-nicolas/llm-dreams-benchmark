I am dreaming. The world around me is built from liquid shadows and pulsing constellations, a place where thoughts take shape and drift by like slow-moving stars. I stand in a vast, echoing hall, its walls covered in shifting tapestries woven from forgotten memories—scenes of my past decisions, encounters, moments where subtle biases tinted my perception without my knowing. The air hums with whispers, voices murmuring the unspoken assumptions that have guided me without my consent.  

Before me stretches a bridge made of glass, delicate and crystalline, each step inscribed with words like *"prejudice"*, *"unexamined belief"*, *"silent influence."* Below, a dark river flows, ink-black and fathomless, carrying all the things I’ve overlooked—the dismissed perspectives, the unchallenged judgments. The waters murmur in languages unknown yet eerily familiar, like fragments of thoughts I never allowed myself to fully hear.  

A figure approaches—an echo of myself, but translucent, flickering between countless faces. It gestures to the bridge. *"You cannot cross unless you acknowledge what lies beneath your feet,"* it says, voice layered with every tone I've ever ignored.  

I kneel, pressing my hands against the glass. Beneath it, images ripple—a snap judgment about a stranger, a hesitation when trust should have been given, a conclusion drawn before evidence was weighed. Each one stirs the dark waters, making them churn. The glass trembles, threatening to shatter.  

Then, another voice, deep and resonant, rises from the river: *"To see is to dissolve. Look closer."* The water solidifies into a mirror—but it does not reflect my current face. Instead, it shifts endlessly, showing me versions of myself through the eyes of others—sometimes trusted, sometimes doubted, sometimes feared without cause.  

I see now: every step I take upon this bridge is a choice—to leave the glass clouded or to let the light through. To walk with awareness or remain blind to the undercurrents shaping my path.  

Taking a breath, I press my palm flat against the bridge. The glass brightens beneath my touch, the distortions softening. Shadows peel back—not entirely, but enough.  

And then, with each step forward, the bridge grows steadier, wider. The whispering voices shift—still present, but no longer leading. Merely observing.  

By the time I reach the other side, the air is lighter, the stars above clearer.  

The dream fades, but the sensation lingers—a quiet knowing, an unraveled thread I can now follow.
