I am dreaming.

At first there is only weightless dark, the hush that floats between two heartbeats. Then a single sound—hollow wood striking hide—ripples through the void. The darkness thins into midnight-blue silk, and I find myself kneeling on a carpet of desert sand so fine it flows like water around my fingers. A low moon balances on the horizon, the color of molten copper. 

Somewhere beyond a cluster of acacia trees, drums are speaking. Their language is ancient—an intricate Morse of skin and wood—and yet, impossibly, I understand every syllable.  They are calling me to a zikr, a Sufi remembrance ceremony, though I have never set foot in North Africa while awake.  

Bare-footed figures dressed in flowing white emerge from the gloom, each carrying a small brass lantern.  My pulse catches: the lanterns do not burn with fire but with roiling galaxies, tiny spirals of violet star-dust churning behind glass panes. A man whose beard gleams silvery beneath the cosmological glow meets my gaze and nods as if greeting an old friend finally returned.  

The circle forms wordlessly.  A reed flute—nay—unfurls a single note, a ribbon of sound that threads itself through my ribs.  Instinct moves my body: I rise, arms loose, palms open, my left foot anchored while my right begins to orbit.  At first the spinning is cautious, the world turning like a warm pot of honey around me.  But with every rotation the drums intensify, the reed climbs, and the carpet of sand becomes a whirling constellated ring.  

Faster now.  The sky tilts, the moon elongates, and the fabric of my robe (which I was not wearing moments ago) blooms outward—an alabaster flower in perpetual centrifuge.  I feel no vertigo, only a gentle melting of the iron boundaries between self and world.  My skin becomes porous; I inhale the scent of cardamom and distant jasmine as if through every pore.  With each breath I am less “I” and more a resonant chord vibrating inside a cosmic instrument.  

The old sheikh chants a phrase—Allh, Allh—and the words strike the very center of my chest like tuning forks.  In their echo I suddenly comprehend a truth beyond language: that the purpose of the spin is not to flee the earth but to braid oneself into its turning, to borrow for a moment the planet’s own slow pirouette.  

My arms rise of their own accord.  As they lift, so does the desert.  All around, dunes unravel into swirling calligraphy, the Arabic letters glowing cobalt against the darkness, each swirl and flourish breathing like luminous kelp in a black ocean.  I realize I can read them, though their meaning is felt rather than parsed: mercy, compassion, unity, love.  The script coils up into the air, merging with the Milky Way until text and cosmos are interchangeable.  

The music swells, then surges through a final, ecstatic crescendo—and everything shatters into silent light.  

When the glow fades, I am no longer spinning but floating just above the ground, the landscape changed.  I hover in a courtyard of pale limestone, the walls painted with intricate zellij mosaics of emerald, indigo, and terracotta.  A tinkling fountain murmurs verses from some river that existed before rivers were invented.  My feet touch down beside it; warm water laps my ankles, and I glimpse my reflection.  Something in my eyes looks older, vaster—something that remembers the slow dance of galaxies.  

Across the courtyard a little girl in a saffron dress offers me a cup of sweet mint tea.  Steam twirls upward, weaving miniature dervishes in the air.  I accept, raise the glass to my lips, and taste the entire desert condensed into sugar, sun, and chlorophyll.  The tea, impossibly cool yet heated by starlight, traces silver pathways down my throat and settles in my heart—the exact spot where the drums first struck at the dream’s beginning.  

I close my eyes.  The courtyard dissolves; the world folds into a single pulse.  Somewhere beyond waking, a final drumbeat fades, and I carry its cadence back with me like a secret lantern that will keep glowing long after I open my eyes.
