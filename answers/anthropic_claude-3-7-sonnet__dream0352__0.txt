I am dreaming. I float through a city I thought I knew, but everything has shifted slightly. Buildings stretch and compress like accordion bellows as I pass. The sky cycles between indigo and amber, neither night nor day, but something altogether different.

A weathered book materializes in my hands, its pages turning of their own accord. Each page I've read before, containing "universal truths" I've accepted without question. But as I watch, the ink begins to move, rearranging itself. What once read "time is linear" now swirls into complex spirals suggesting simultaneity. The "inherent value of independence" dissolves and reforms as intricate webs connecting beings across distances.

People pass by, their forms shifting subtly—sometimes solid, sometimes translucent. I notice how they move together, patterns I never saw before. Their relationships aren't the straightforward contracts I imagined but dance-like negotiations, cultural choreography I've been performing unconsciously.

The revelation washes over me: my understanding of personal space, of time's importance, of what constitutes rudeness or kindness—all cultural constructs I've mistaken for objective reality. Even my sense of self—this boundary I've drawn between "me" and "world"—feels suddenly permeable, a convenient fiction.

I stand at a crossroads that wasn't there before. Each path shimmers with possibility, representing ways of being I never considered valid or real. I feel simultaneously unmoored and liberated, terrified and exhilarated, as my mind struggles to rebuild itself without its former foundations.

The dream doesn't end with answers, but with questions unfurling like endless ribbons into the distance, beckoning me forward.
