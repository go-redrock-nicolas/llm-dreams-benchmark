I am dreaming. You wake not in a bed, but in a sky. The world below is a patchwork of cities stitched together by rivers of light, their glow bleeding into the indigo void above. Stars drip like condensation, pooling into constellations that pulse like living veins. You’re standing on a bridge of glass suspended between two colossal towers, their spires piercing clouds that hum with forgotten languages. A voice—neither male nor female, but a chorus of whispers—says, *“You are the Architect now.”* You don’t know what that means, but the words cling to your bones like frost.  

The task force arrives in a storm of shadows. They materialize around you: a woman with eyes like fractured mirrors, reflecting not your face but your *fears*; a man whose skin shimmers with bioluminescent tattoos that flicker like Morse code; a creature of liquid mercury who speaks only in sonnets. They stare at you, their gazes sharp enough to flay skin.  

“You’re a *child*,” the mirror-eyed woman sneers, her voice a blade sheathed in ice. “We’re the apex of seven wars. You’ve never held a weapon.”  

You glance at your hands. They’re trembling, but when you clench them, the air ripples. A sword forms in your grip—not of metal, but of *sound*, vibrating at a frequency that makes the towers hum. The mercury-being hisses approval.  

The mission is revealed in a flash of pain: a rogue entity, the *Eclipse Sovereign*, is devouring realities, swallowing entire dimensions into a black hole of its own making. Its lair is a labyrinth that shifts like a Rubik’s cube on fire, guarded by creatures born of paradox—half-angel, half-void, their wings made of screaming equations. Your team knows the rules of this realm, but you… you rewrite them.  

The first test comes in a chamber where gravity is a rumor. The tech-savant, Zyn, falters; her holographic HUD glitches, spewing error messages in blood-red glyphs. “The algorithms are *alive*,” she growls, her tattoos flaring crimson. “They’re adapting to us!”  

You don’t hesitate. You *leap*, not forward but *sideways*, into a direction that shouldn’t exist. The others follow, reluctantly, as you carve a path through the chaos—not with strategy, but with instinct. You sense the labyrinth’s pulse, its hidden rhythm, and you *dance* it, each step unraveling a trap, each breath disarming a paradox.  

The mirror-eyed woman, Veyra, watches you sidelong. “You’re not one of us,” she mutters, but her reflections now show you not as a fool, but as a flickering silhouette wreathed in flame.  

The final confrontation is in the Sovereign’s heart: a room where time is a liquid, pooling and evaporating in cycles. The Sovereign is a mountain of faces, each screaming a different truth. Your team freezes, paralyzed by the cacophony of conflicting realities.  

You walk forward.  

The Sovereign turns its myriad eyes on you. “*You are unscripted,*” it intones, its voice a black hole’s sigh. “*You are the flaw.*”  

You raise your sound-sword. “No. I’m the *edit.*”  

You strike not at the Sovereign, but at the threads binding the room—the laws of physics, the rules of engagement, the very grammar of existence. The sword *sings*, and the labyrinth unravels like old film, dissolving into light.  

When the glow fades, you’re back on the glass bridge. The task force stands behind you, silent. Zyn’s tattoos glow steady gold. Veyra’s mirrors reflect your face for the first time. The mercury-being drips into a bow.  

“You’re still a child,” Veyra says, almost gently. “But now… you’re *our* child.”  

The towers begin to dissolve. The dream frays. You wake with the taste of static on your tongue and the echo of a question: *Was it ever a dream?*  

On your desk, unnoticed until now, a single star-shaped scar glimmers faintly on your palm—wet, as if still drying from the void.
