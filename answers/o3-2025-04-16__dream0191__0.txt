I am dreaming. …feel the brittle filament of your head-lamp gasp its last breath and die in a trembling sigh of sparks.  A velvet darkness—so total it seems to have weight—presses against your eyelids even when they are wide, frantic, searching.  The cave exhales dust and minerals and a metallic tang that settles on the back of your tongue like a penny.  In the hush after the quake, your pulse is the only obvious sound: a kettledrum echoing inside your skull.

You crouch, palms flat to the damp floor, and realize your own small body is the only warm thing for miles.  The rock beneath you is older than memory, older than moonlight—its chill climbs your arms as if it wants to wear you like a cloak.  Then, very far off, you catch the shy, quivering glow of something alive. 

At first you think your starved eyes are inventing it, but the glimmer grows—pear-green, the precise shade between envy and new leaves.  Lichen?  Bioluminescent fungus?  No, these are tiny firefly-like creatures drifting toward you in slow eddies, each a floating ember with wings as delicate as sighs.  They swirl in a spiral storm around your kneeling form, and suddenly the darkness is not empty but cathedral-vast, its invisible roof arched by the insects’ flickering halos.

You rise and test your steps.  Every slice of stone, every ripple of stalagmite appears now in ghost-light, sketchy but navigable.  The brood of living lanterns escorts you deeper, into arteries of the earth the quake has freshly torn open.  The air grows warmer, humming with subterranean electricity; somewhere water rushes—an underground river in perpetual night.

Down a corridor ribboned with quartz veins, you notice something carved into the walls: glyphs half-erased by time, their edges softened like forgotten names.  They show spiral suns, feathered serpents, and a single door drawn again and again—a rectangle hovering above waves.  The drawings glow faintly, as if they remember the touch of those same insects dancing in your peripheral vision.

The buzzing cloud parts, and you find yourself on the shore of that hidden river.  It is pitch-black and eerily still, but when one of the glowing moth-flies lands on its surface the water flashes outward in concentric rings of turquoise light, as if the river is itself a liquid constellation.  You kneel, cup some in your hands, and the water responds—spelling shapes across your palm: a compass rose, then an arrow pointing upstream.

You follow.  The pulse of the river becomes a heartbeat in the soles of your boots.  Tunnels branch like capillaries; each choice feels guided by intuition or perhaps by the living sparks swirling ahead.  Finally the passage opens into an immense dome, the size of a cathedral’s nave, whose ceiling is lost in darkness.  At its center, on an island of marble as white as a whale’s skeleton, stands the door from the glyphs—a slate-grey monolith that should not exist here.  It is upright, freestanding, with no frame or hinges, yet slightly ajar.  Through the crack you glimpse neither light nor shadow, but the color of dawn-pink clouds seen through closed eyes.

Your insect companions settle on the door’s surface, forming constellations that mirror the night sky you left above ground.  You reach out.  The stone is warm—impossibly so—and seems to hum with the memory of distant thunderstorms.  As you push, the crack widens silently, revealing not another room, but the first scent of morning after rain: petrichor, wet grass, the hush of sunrise.  A wind—fresh, impossible this far beneath the earth—grazes your cheek.

A single thought blooms: every exit is also an entrance.  You step through.

Light rushes at you like the sea.  For a moment you are nowhere—perhaps everywhere—standing on the seam between two realms stitched by dreaming.  Then the luminance fades, resolving into the familiar geometry of your own bedroom ceiling.  Your heart is still thundering; your palms still smell faintly of cold stone and river water.

On the nightstand, your flashlight lies in perfect working order—yet its bulb glows with that same pear-green phosphorescence, quietly pulsing like the breath of a hidden world that may still be waiting, patient as stone, beneath your feet.
