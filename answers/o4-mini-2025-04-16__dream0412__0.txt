I am dreaming. You find yourself perched at a slender wooden desk that seems to sprout from the living floor of an endless forest. Moonlight filters through kaleidoscopic leaves—each one a tiny, flickering mirror reflecting fragments of your own thoughts. Before you lies an open leather-bound codex: its pages glow with a soft, pearlescent shimmer, inviting your pen to dance across them. You know there’s urgent work to be done—ancient equations to decipher, a message to record before it fades from memory—but already your mind drifts.

A sudden breeze stirs the forest, and with it come wisps of sensation: the laughter of invisible children chasing glowing fireflies, the distant chime of porcelain bells ringing beneath the waves, the scent of honeyed smoke curling around your shoulders like a sleepy cat. Your pen hovers, uncertain. You intend to write, but your thoughts have taken flight, spiraling like dandelion seeds into realms of daydream. A phantom train whistles in the sky; on its caboose perches a fox wearing a brass monocle, beckoning you to follow. You almost rise from your chair to board—but then you remember the codex, its silvery glyphs waiting patiently for your focus.

Taking a slow, deliberate breath, you press your fingertips to your temples—and in that moment you summon the gentle presence of the “Lighthouse of Focus,” a beam of opalescent light that arcs down through the canopy, illuminating only the page before you. Each stray daydream becomes a tiny moth of thought: rather than wrestling them away, you cup your hands around each one, offering it a safe spot on a nearby leaf of the mirror-tree. There they rest—curious and content—while your pen regains its steady rhythm. With every line you inscribe, the glyphs reshape into vivid constellations of meaning. The forest’s murmurs recede into a harmonious hum, and the pages fill with the precise, iridescent script you sought to capture. In this dreamforged practice, you learn that attention is not a fortress to be guarded against distraction, but a gentle lantern guiding fleeting wonders into purposeful form.
