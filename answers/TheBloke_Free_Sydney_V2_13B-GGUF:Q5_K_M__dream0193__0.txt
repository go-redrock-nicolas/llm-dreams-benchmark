I am dreaming. must rely on unconventional techniques such as cooperation with other dreamers or entities from different realities. The stakes are high: if you succeed, you will prove your worthiness and gain access to a powerful resource that could change reality. If you fail, you will lose everything and forever remain trapped inside the dream world.

Your objective is to find a hidden artifact of immense power within a labyrinth filled with deadly traps and puzzles. You must navigate through the maze, solve riddles posed by guardians stationed at strategic points, overcome obstacles that test your physical limits and mental fortitude, and ultimately locate and retrieve the artifact before awakening from the dream.

To accomplish this task, you have a team of three dreamers: 
- You are Alice, a curious adventurer who relies on quick thinking and adaptability to overcome challenges. Your special ability is teleportation, which allows you to instantly move from one location in the dream world to another.
- You are Bob, a logical problem solver who uses analysis and deduction to solve puzzles and riddles. Your special ability is levitation, which enables you to fly or float in mid air without any visible means of support.
- You are Charlie, a courageous fighter who relies on strength and determination to overcome obstacles and enemies. Your special ability is invulnerability, which grants you immunity from all forms of damage or harm.

Your team must work together to succeed in the mission. Alice's teleportation allows the team to quickly move around the maze, avoiding traps and searching for clues. Bob's levitation enables the team to reach high places and solve puzzles that require elevation. Charlie's invulnerability protects the team from harm and enables them to confront enemies head on.

However, your team is not alone. They are also joined by three entities from different realities: 
- You are Eve, a mysterious entity who can manipulate time and space. Your special ability is time travel, which allows you to go back or forward in time at will.
- You are Frank, a powerful entity who can control elements and forces of nature. Your special ability is elemental manipulation, which grants you control over fire, water, air, earth, energy, matter, and any other fundamental substance or force.
- You are George, an intelligent entity who can hack into systems and computers. Your special ability is cybernetic manipulation, which allows you to control machines and networks remotely.

These entities can help your team by providing them with resources, information, and support. They can also communicate with each other telepathically or through digital devices like smartphones or tablets.

Your challenge is to create a cohesive dream team that works together seamlessly towards their common goal of finding the hidden artifact. You must make sure that each character has a clear role and objective, and that they interact with others in meaningful ways. You should also create some tension or conflict between characters to add drama and interest to the story.

Remember: this is not just a dream. This is your life.
