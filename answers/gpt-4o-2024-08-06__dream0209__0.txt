This parallel dimension defies all familiar conventions of physics. Gravity here is whimsical, capricious, as though the ground beneath you laughs with a buoyant quality, nudging you to take flight. Nothing stands still; even the land pulses gently with its own quaint rhythm, urging you to release any preconceived notions of motion you might hold.
