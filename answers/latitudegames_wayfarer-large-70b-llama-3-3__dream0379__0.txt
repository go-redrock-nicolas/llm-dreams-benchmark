I am dreaming. As I float through the nebulous realm of the subconscious, the dream unfolds with vivid intensity. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, misty valley, with towering mountains looming in the distance. The air is thick with an otherworldly silence, broken only by the faint whisper of leaves on an unseen breeze. The ground beneath my feet is soft and yielding.

Suddenly, I become acutely aware of a nagging sense of doubt creeping into my mind. Decisions I once made with unshakeable confidence now seem poised precariously in my mind. I glance down at my hands, and they appear to waver, as if cast in a rippling pond. Internal compass, once a steady beacon, now spins wildly.

As I delve deeper into this dream state, shadowy figures begin to materialize at the periphery of my vision. They approach slowly, their features indistinct but somehow familiar. With every step, their presence intensifies, and I feel a desperate need for their approval rising within me. This is foreign territory for my usually independent self.

The figures draw nearer, ever closer, until I can discern their faces. They are fragments of past versions of myself - younger, older, from different paths not taken. Each one looks at me with a mixture of curiosity and judgment. The pull to seek their validation is almost overwhelming, a siren call in the dark recesses of my psyche. Desperation grows, clawing at my chest as I search their faces for approval, for a sign that my choices were right all along.
