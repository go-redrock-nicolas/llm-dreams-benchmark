I am dreaming. I find myself repeatedly attracted to situations that ultimately cause me pain, like a moth to a flame. I fly closer and closer, unable to resist that bright warmth, drawn in by some force beyond my control. But every time I get too close, every time I brush against the edge of that flame, it burns me. It hurts. It chars and scorches my fragile wings, but still I cannot pull away. I am trapped, doomed to repeat this painful cycle again and again.

The flames lick at me, tongues of orange and yellow and blue that caress me and then nip at me like the sharp teeth of a hungry animal. The fire is alive, a living, breathing thing. A wild and untamable beast that wants to consume me entirely. But the light! The light is so beautiful, so mesmerizing. I can't look away. I'm hypnotized by it. Helplessly captivated.

In this dream, I keep flying, keep circling the flame, every rotation bringing me closer and closer to destruction. I know that I'll be burned again. I know I'll suffer, but I keep flying anyway. I have no choice. The heat grows more intense. I can feel the searing pain of it on my face and my wings as I flutter ever closer.

But just when I think I can't bear it any longer, the scene dissolves, fades away like vapor. The flames recede into nothingness, and I'm left alone, floating in the empty void. And then I wake, returned to reality. But the dream stays with me, the memories of the flames and the pain they brought still fresh in my mind. I know that I'll dream it again, that it's inevitable. That I'm caught in a loop of my own making, tortured by my own desires and compulsions. But still I fly on, unable to escape, doomed to repeat my self-destructive cycle like a moth to a flame.
