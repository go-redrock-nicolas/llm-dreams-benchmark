I am dreaming. I find myself in an endless art gallery where the walls seem to breathe and shift like living tissue. The paintings are all mirrors, but instead of reflecting my current self, they show different versions of me - some confident and radiant, others hunched and seeking validation from shadowy figures that keep receding into the gilded frames.

As I walk down the seemingly infinite corridor, the floor beneath my feet transforms from solid marble to a transparent crystal, revealing a swirling ocean of unspoken words and unfulfilled desires. Each step creates ripples in this emotional sea, and I can feel the weight of every "please like me" and "am I good enough?" pulling at my ankles like desperate hands.

The shadowy figures I've been chasing throughout my life materialize at the end of each hallway - parents, teachers, mentors, lovers - their faces constantly morphing into one another. When I reach out, they dissolve into butterflies made of dark smoke, their wings carrying away the praise and acceptance I so desperately seek.

Suddenly, the mirrors begin to crack, not with a violent shatter but with a gentle, musical tinkling. Through these cracks, golden light pours in, and I realize it's emanating from within me. Each fragment of mirror now reflects this inner radiance, and the shadowy figures start to look pale and insubstantial in comparison.

The gallery walls melt away like candle wax, revealing an infinite starfield. I float among the constellations, finally understanding that the approval I've been seeking has been within me all along, burning as brightly as these celestial bodies. The stars spell out words in an ancient language I somehow understand: "You are your own light."

As this realization washes over me, the dream shifts into a kaleidoscope of self-acceptance, each fragment a moment where I could have been kinder to myself, could have recognized my own worth without external validation. The shadowy figures are still there, but they've transformed into distant nebulae, beautiful but no longer crucial to my existence.

I feel myself awakening, but carry with me the warm glow of self-discovery, understanding that the most important approval has always been my own.
