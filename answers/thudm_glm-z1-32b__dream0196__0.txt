You are the one

The dream unfolds in a cathedral of sound, where the walls undulate like liquid obsidian and the air thrums with residual vibrations of a thousand symphonies past. You stumble onto the stage, your feet sinking into carpets embroidered with stave notation that bleeds into constellations. The conductor’s baton—now a living serpent with iridescent scales—points at the score hovering before you, its pages glowing with hieroglyphs that pulse in time to your racing heartbeat. The audience, a sea of faces that blur into shifting mandalas, holds its breath as the first measure of a nocturne written for a 14-stringed harp and a cello forged from blacksmithed lightning cracks on the page.  

Your hands, unacquainted with such artistry, begin to moveively. The violin you’ve never touched becomes an extension of your spine, its strings humming with memories of Bach’s ghosts. The score mutates; measures spiral into fractals, demanding you solve equations in color and sound. You play chords that fracture realities, summoning a storm of paper birds that scrawl counterpoint in the air. The audience’s collective breath becomes wind, the conductor’s serpent a metronome of starlight, as you conduct the chaos into coherence—each note a bridge across dimensions.  

When the final crescendo shatters into silence, the hall doesn’t applaud. Instead, the walls peel back, revealing a sky where constellations rearrange themselves into sheet music. You wake, fingers still numb with phantom vibrations, to find your alarm clock’s face etched with a single chord progression, its melody now hummed involuntarily in the quiet, ordinary dawn.
