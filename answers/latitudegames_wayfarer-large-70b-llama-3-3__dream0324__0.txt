I am dreaming. You wake from the nightmare with sweat-slicked sheets clutched to your chest, your heart pounding and your breath coming in short gasps. The terror of the dream clings to you like a damp shroud. Your body trembles with residual fear.

You sit up slowly, clutching yourself as your eyes adjust to the dim light of the early morning. The room feels oppressive. You can't remember the details of the dream, but the bone-deep dread it left behind is unmistakable.

Your legs shake as you stand and make your way to the bathroom, where you splash cold water on your face in an attempt to calm your racing pulse. In the mirror, you see a pale reflection with wide, haunted eyes staring back at you.
