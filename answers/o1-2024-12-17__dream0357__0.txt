I am dreaming. You stand at the edge of a great, shifting landscape, your heart still pounding from a narrow escape you can scarcely recall. The air is heavy with the scent of charred earth, as if lightning had scorched the ground mere moments ago. Clouds swirl overhead in ominous shades of purple and green, like a bruise spreading across the sky. You sense the thunder rolling in the distance, low and resonant, and inside you feel a deep tremor—an echo of your own mortal fragility. 

As you move forward, the terrain transforms beneath your feet. Stones clatter away, revealing a winding path that coils like the spine of some ancient serpent. Flickers of lightning expose the path’s glimmering, iridescent surface, shining colors that make you dizzy with wonder. Though the storm overhead menaces you, the embossed pattern of the path beckons, filling you with equal parts curiosity and dread. You realize that each step takes you closer to the understanding that your time is finite. This truth weighs heavily in your limbs, but you continue onward because there is no other choice—turning back would lead only into the swirling abyss from which you’ve just emerged.

You traverse pools of light cast by strange, phosphorescent lotus blossoms floating in shallow puddles. Their pale, ghostly radiance illuminates images embedded in the path: intricate symbols, labyrinthine designs, half-formed faces that shift the second you try to focus on them. Sometimes, you think you see your own face among them, pressed into the shimmering surface, a fleeting hint of your reflection. Cold realization slithers up your spine: each design is a life story, a note in the cosmic symphony of existence. Yours is but a single melody in an endless chorus.

Eventually, you come to a break in the path, a wide gap where the serpentine trail has snapped like a broken bone. Below is a swirling chasm, dark as the deepest ocean, its edges lapped by silver flames that flicker against the endless night. In that burning pit, you glimpse shapes—shadows of possibilities, regrets, all the moments you’ve wasted believing you had time. The air crackles with electricity; the hair on your arms lifts as realization ignites: Danger has laid bare your vulnerability, and no illusions remain to shield you from the truth that your life, no matter how brightly it has burned, is fragile.

Gripping the edges of the broken path, you feel the flutter of your heart, the rhythm of life that is yours alone. This sense of mortality swells within you like the tide. Then, above the open jaw of the chasm, you notice a single ropebridge swaying. It looks ancient, its planks worn by countless travelers—each one, perhaps, vigilant of their fragile existence. Steadying your breath, you place your foot on the first plank. You can feel the bridge groan under your weight, but it holds. Step by step, the symbolism of it all overwhelms you: a crossing over, a leap of faith in the face of everything nighttime terror can conjure. Beneath you, the silver flames hiss and swirl. The thunder above roars like a gut-wrenching cry—but you press onward.

Across the divide, the path continues into a damp glade wreathed in deep, emerald vines dripping with water droplets that sparkle in the odd, stormy light. Heart still thudding, you notice your reflection in a pool at your feet. It’s your face, but something about it feels ancient, carved in worry and revelation. A slow breath escapes your lips, and you sense a transformation. You are still you, still mortal, but more awake than ever to the precariousness of your heartbeat, the delicateness of your breath. And though your dream has confronted you with a close brush with oblivion, a newfound determination now stirs within. 

You have emerged from the dream’s tempest with the knowledge that the precious unity of body and spirit can be scattered at a moment’s notice. The vines part, revealing a final, quiet glow of moonlight, and you see the storm fading behind you. There, just beyond the green tapestry, lies the promise of dawn. And in that promise, you feel a stirring—hope, pulsing in your veins despite all fears that strive to silence it. Even while the memory of this spectral place begins to slip away, the lesson remains: your life is an astonishing, fragile wonder, and you have chosen to keep moving forward.
