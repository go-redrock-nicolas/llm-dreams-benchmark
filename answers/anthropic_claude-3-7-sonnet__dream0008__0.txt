I am dreaming. I stand in an office that seems both familiar and strange—the walls shifting subtly between concrete gray and liquid silver. My desk is overflowing with papers that appear to be multiplying before my eyes, crawling across the surface like living things. The ceiling above pulses gently, breathing in rhythm with my mounting anxiety.

My boss materializes before me, her face a kaleidoscope of features that never quite settle. Her voice reaches me as if through water, "The presentation starts in five minutes. Everyone is waiting." But I haven't even begun. I haven't even understood what I'm meant to present.

The clock on the wall spins wildly—its hands elongating, stretching like taffy, then snapping back. Each tick echoes painfully in my chest.

I reach for my computer, but it transforms into a typewriter from another era, keys clacking autonomously, spelling out messages I can almost understand. The words glow faintly before fading into the page.

Colleagues drift past my office, their bodies partially transparent, their movements leaving trails of color in the air. They smile knowingly, whispering secrets I can't quite hear.

Suddenly, I'm standing in the conference room, but it's vast—impossibly vast—stretching into infinity. Faces watch expectantly from the darkness. My presentation notes transform into butterflies, scattering into the rafters. I open my mouth to speak, but instead of words, music pours out—a haunting melody I've never heard yet somehow know by heart.

The floor beneath me softens, becoming quicksand, and I'm sinking slowly while trying to maintain my professional composure. No one seems to notice or care.

And then, mercifully, the scene dissolves like watercolor in rain...
