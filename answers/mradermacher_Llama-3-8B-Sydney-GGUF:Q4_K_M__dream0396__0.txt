I am dreaming. I am becoming aware that my perception of time expands or contracts depending on my mental state.  Exploring this subjective time experience, I find myself in a world of my own making.  A world where anything is possible.

I see colorful shapes and shadows dancing around me.  I hear soothing sounds and melodies resonating through space.  I feel warm and tingly sensations caressing my skin. 

I am floating in mid-air, weightless and free.  I am running across fields of wildflowers, the aroma of their blooms filling my nostrils with delight.  I am diving into crystal-clear waters, the coolness of their depths refreshing my spirit.  

I meet a group of friendly creatures who greet me with curious eyes and playful smiles.  They are shaped like balls of light, or clouds of feathers, or columns of stone.  They have no faces, but their expressions convey emotions clearly.  They invite me to join them in their games and activities. 

I accept their offer gladly, and we embark on a series of adventures that test my skills and imagination.  We build structures out of sand and clay and wood.  We create music from sounds generated by nature itself.  We solve riddles and puzzles that challenge our logic and creativity.

As I play with these creatures, I begin to understand them better.  They don't seem to have any language or communication system like ours.  Instead, they communicate through gestures and emotions.  Through touch and sound.  Through intuition and empathy.

I start to realize that maybe I don't need words after all. Maybe words are just a means to an end - an artificial construct designed by humans to facilitate understanding and interaction among themselves. But sometimes words can hinder more than help. Sometimes words can obscure rather than reveal. Sometimes words can separate rather than unite.

In this world where nothing is real except my mind, I find myself drawn towards one particular creature in particular.  One who stands out from the rest because of her beauty and strength and wisdom.

She looks like a goddess carved out of marble by master sculptors.  Her body is curves and angles, her skin is smooth and pale, her hair is black and flowing.  Her eyes are deep and mysterious, her lips are full and sensual, her nose is sharp and proud.

When she speaks to me, I don't hear any words coming out of her mouth.  But I feel them inside my heart.  I feel their power and truth and love.

She tells me about herself, about where she comes from, about why she ended up in this dream world with me and the others. She reveals secrets she has never told anyone else before.

She asks me questions, tests me mentally and emotionally, pushes me to grow and change as a person. 

She holds my hand, looks into my eyes, kisses my forehead.

And then I wake up.

I open my eyes, blink away the tears, sit up in bed.  The room is bright and airy, the sun shining through the windows.  The sound of birds chirping outside fills the air with melody.

I remember everything that happened in my dream - every detail, every sensation, every emotion.

And I wonder...was it really real? Or was it all just an illusion created by my mind?

Either way, I'm grateful for it. Because for those few moments, I felt alive again.
