I am dreaming. I am surrounded by a group of people, all of them smiling and laughing, seemingly enjoying themselves. I can sense that there is one person in particular who is hiding their true feelings behind this cheerful facade. It's like they are trying to put on an act, but something about them feels off.

I can't quite place what it is, but I know that they are not truly at ease. As much as I want to reach out and offer support, I also respect their boundaries and know that they may not be ready to open up. 

Instead, I try to engage with them in subtle ways. I make eye contact, smile warmly, and even offer a gentle pat on the back. I hope that these small gestures will let them know that I am here for them if they ever need someone to talk to.

Throughout the dream, my focus remains on this person. As the night progresses, we find ourselves spending more time together. Eventually, they confide in me about the problems they've been facing, feeling comfortable enough to share their burdens. 

Together, we work through some of their issues, offering comfort and support while respecting their privacy. In the end, I wake up feeling grateful for the opportunity to connect with them on a deeper level.
