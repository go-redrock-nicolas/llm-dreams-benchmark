I am dreaming. I am in a bustling city, amidst towering skyscrapers and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The streets are crowded with people rushing to and fro, engrossed in their own lives, lost in the chaos. Suddenly, a man appears on the sidewalk, in the midst of this cacophony. He is around 40, with a gentle, weathered face and kind eyes. He stands out, not because of his appearance, but because of his demeanor.

The man begins to hand out small notes to everyone who passes by. Some glance at them, some shake their heads, but most simply accept them and continue on their way. I'm curious and approach him, intrigued. He smiles at me, holding out a note. I take it, expecting to see a large sum of money or a gift coupon. But instead, I find a simple message: "Choose kindness."

My heart swells with emotion as I read those words. They resonate deep within me, reminding me of the power of compassion and empathy. Tears begin to well up in my eyes, and I'm drawn to this man's aura of grace and benevolence. Before I can say or do anything, he turns and walks away, disappearing into the crowd.

I stand there, clutching the note, feeling a mix of sadness and gratitude. Sadness that I had forgotten the importance of kindness in my daily life, and gratitude for the reminder. I wake up, my mind filled with the image of that man and his simple yet profound message. As I open my eyes, the note crumpled in my fist, I vow to choose kindness every day, to be the light in someone's darkness, and to spread love, hope, and compassion wherever I go.
