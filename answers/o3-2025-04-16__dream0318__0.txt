I am dreaming. …wake up inside a hall of mirrors that stretches in every direction like a glass-walled cathedral. The air smells faintly of ink and wet paper—as though every lie you have ever told has been transcribed on pages that now flutter overhead like dark, whispering moths. Each mirror shows a different version of you, and every reflection is busy spinning an incongruent tale:

One mirror-self claims to be an astronaut who once planted a sapphire flag on the palest crater of Jupiter’s ice moon—she still has lunar dust glittering in her eyelashes.  
Another insists he invented a musical language understood only by rainstorms—he hums, and clouds gather obediently inside his glass square, bursting into applause of silver droplets.  
A third reflection swears she negotiated peace between rival kingdoms of subterranean moles—tiny velvet-furred diplomats peek from her pockets, nodding solemnly.

The stories pile on until the mirrors can scarcely hold them; hairline cracks radiate outward, unable to bear the weight of so many incompatible universes. Suddenly the walls split, and you fall forward into a library with no ceiling, shelves corkscrewing into a starry abyss. Every book’s spine is stamped with an impossible episode from your invented past:

• “How I Outran the Sunset Across Seven Forgotten Deserts”  
• “Conversations with the Sphinx After Midnight”  
• “Blueprints for a City That Dreams Itself Awake”

You pluck a volume at random. As you open it, letters begin to rearrange, refusing to stay put, phrases swapping places like restless actors altering the script mid-play. You realize with a shiver of vertigo that even the lies no longer recognize their original shapes; they are evolving, breeding new sub-fictions faster than you can read them.

A gentle cough echoes behind you. Turning, you find a tidy librarian with ink-black eyes—eyes that look as though they’ve never blinked once in the long eternity of custodianship. She lowers her spectacles and speaks in a voice that rustles like turning pages:

“Your narratives are overcrowded. They demand air. Tell me, traveler of half-truths, which story is the seed, and which is the ivy?”

Your mouth opens, but words collapse into mist. You cannot remember which deeds you truly accomplished and which you simply narrated into existence. Panic flares; if you can’t distinguish fact from fiction, will the library keep expanding forever, devouring reality leaf by leaf?

The librarian gestures to a brass key dangling from a distant shelf—its teeth carved in the shape of a question mark. “A single honest sentence,” she says, “will lock every extraneous door and leave only the corridor you were meant to walk.”

Desperate, you reach for the key. But the shelf scuttles away on insect legs, chittering sarcastically, as though mocking your sudden hunger for sincerity. Shelves sprout pincers; volumes snap shut like clams. The entire library becomes an impossible clockwork menagerie assembled from your own evasions.

You sprint, corridors wheeling around you, floors tilting. At last you corner the key in a cul-de-shelf where biographies of people who never lived huddle like nervous ghosts. The brass feels warm against your palm. Trembling, you speak aloud one raw, unembroidered truth—any truth at all.

“I was once afraid that the plain facts of my life were not luminous enough,” you confess. At that instant the library shivers; the shelves freeze; the books reshelve themselves with a soft sigh of recognition. Pages calm, ink settles.

A door appears: plain wood, unornamented, lit by a single beam of morning sun. The librarian nods, satisfied. “Remember,” she says, “stories are lanterns, not labyrinths.” Then she dissolves into a quiet snowfall of punctuation marks.

You step through the door and find yourself on an ordinary suburban sidewalk at dawn. A newspaper lies on a damp lawn, headlines utterly mundane. Yet the sunrise looks impossibly vivid, and your lungs fill with crisp air that tastes of newfound honesty. Behind you, the door folds into daylight and is gone.

You wake in your real bed—heart pounding, lips curved in a half-smile—wondering how long the calm will last before another dazzling, unnecessary fiction comes knocking on the walls of your mind.
