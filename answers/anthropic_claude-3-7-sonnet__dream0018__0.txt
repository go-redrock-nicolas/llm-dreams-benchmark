I am dreaming. I discover that my home's foundation is crumbling—not just physically, but somehow metaphysically. The walls aren't merely cracked; they're dissolving at the edges like watercolor bleeding into parchment. The ceiling sags not with weight but with uncertainty, as if forgetting its purpose. When I place my palm against the living room wall, it thrums with a faint heartbeat.

With resources that amount to a rusty toolbox and half-remembered advice from my grandfather, I begin the impossible repair. My fingers become sensitive instruments detecting the house's pain points. The nails I find in the basement have tiny inscriptions on them—memories from previous owners, glinting in the dust-filtered light.

As I work, the house responds. When I mend a fracture in the kitchen, fruit appears in a bowl that was empty moments before. Fixing a window frame causes the glass to ripple like a pond, reflecting not the outside world but scenes from my childhood.

The structural damage, I realize with growing wonder, correlates with forgotten moments of my life. Each splintered beam represents a neglected friendship; each corroded pipe, an abandoned dream. The more I repair, the more I remember.

The tools transform in my hands—the hammer becoming a conductor's baton, orchestrating the symphony of reconstruction. The wood I cut bleeds sap that smells of summer camp and first love. My sweat falls onto the floorboards and sprouts tiny luminescent mushrooms that light my way into the darkest corners.

Night and day cycle rapidly through the windows as I work, sometimes lasting only minutes. Occasionally, visitors appear—some I recognize, others are strangers with familiar eyes—all offering cryptic advice before dissolving into the wallpaper.

As the final beam is secured, the house sighs around me, settling not just into physical stability but into dimensional alignment. The rooms now connect in ways that defy euclidean geometry, doorways sometimes leading where they shouldn't, yet exactly where I need to go.

I realize then that I haven't been repairing a house—I've been rebuilding myself.
