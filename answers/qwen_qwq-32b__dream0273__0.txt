I am dreaming. The scene shifts to an office setting, but not as I remember it. The fluorescent lights hum a dissonant tune, flickering like a disturbed conscience. Cubicles stretch endlessly in all directions, their gray walls glowing faintly, as though lit from within by some sickly bioluminescent mold. My desk is a sarcophagus of piled paperwork, each sheet oozing black ink that writhe like tiny vipers. The air is thick with the scent of burnt coffee and bureaucracy. Every time I try to shuffle through the papers, they multiply, spawning endless memos in triplicate, each one demanding I sign, submit, conform. 

Then, the walls heave. The cubicle dividers split open, revealing transparent layers beneath—each layer a worse version of my job. The first layer: colleagues with empty eye sockets shuffling papers. The second: a clock tower looms, its hands spinning backward, each tick echoing like a heartbeat. The third: the CEO’s face materializes on the ceiling, his mouth a cavern devouring the whispers of dissent. 

I run, but the floors twist into steep inclines. My footsteps leave footprints filled with my own drained hours, each step heavy with the weight of deadlined days. The exit sign pulses red, but when I near it, it morphs into a giant paper shredder, its teeth hungry for my skeleton. 

A voice whispers, "Sign here," from the corner. I turn. It’s my reflection in a monitor, but aged decades, eyes hollow,instanciating the man I’ll become if I stay. The cursor blinks relentlessly. I reach for the pen, but my hand phases through it. The reflection’s mouth twitches into a smile. 

Suddenly, the ceiling ruptures. A shaft of golden light spills in, carrying a bird made of liquid sunlight. It perches on my desk, and where it treads, the black ink solidifies into soil. The bird pecks at a memo, and it sprouts a single dandelion. It blows, and the seeds become paper airplanes, each one a rebellion. I inhale—smell of chamomile and thunder. The planes scatter, dissolving cubicle walls. The dandelion roots snake under my desk, cracking the floor, releasing a gasp of earth. 

I plant my palm on the growing stem. The office quakes. The CEO’s face distorts, crackling like a bad signal. The bird sings, a sound like a FileWriter dropping aFontAwesome. The ground splits open beneath me. I fall—not down, but towards a horizon painted with infinite forests. Below, the office shrinks into a pixel, flickering out like a dying star. 

I land softly. The air smells of rain and possibility. The bird is now a girl with wings of parchment, her hair a braid of twigs and static. She holds out a sapling, its leaves glowing. "A tree," she says, "that remembers soil." I take it, my hand solid again. Behind us, the horizon where the office died flickers once, then is still. 

The forest is alive, raw, untamed. My reflection in a nearby pool shows me young again, eyes wide with wildness.
