I am dreaming. I'm tasked with facilitating dialogue between groups with fundamentally opposing worldviews and values systems. When initial discussions lead to deeper divisions, you decide to create a shared dreamscape as a neutral ground for communication. You gather your team of dream experts and shape the dream realm according to their suggestions: fluffy clouds floating in a blue sky, a lush green forest with talking animals, an underwater world with glowing fish and coral reefs, a futuristic cityscape with flying cars and neon lights. You invite all participants to enter the dream realm through their own dreams or special devices that induce lucid dreaming. 

You enter the dream realm as yourself - an ancient, wise and powerful entity who can manifest any form or ability you desire. You hope this will give you some authority and credibility among other participants. 

As soon as you step into the dream world, you see that it has been transformed by a rival team of dream experts led by a shadowy figure called Nightmare. They have turned all five dream realms into dark, twisted versions of themselves: clouds are made of ash and smoke, trees are skeletal and spiky, fish and corals glow with an eerie green light, buildings are decayed and ruined, streets are littered with garbage and rubble. You also notice that Nightmare has summoned powerful nightmares from the collective unconsciousness of all participants and set them loose in the dream realm. 

Before you can react or respond to this aggression, you feel a familiar pull on your consciousness. You realize that someone is trying to hack into your dreams and steal your knowledge and power. You resist fiercely but struggle against an unknown adversary who seems more powerful than ever before. 

You wake up sweating and disoriented. You wonder if it was just a nightmare or if something really happened while you were asleep. You decide to check your devices and accounts for any signs of intrusion or tampering.

What do you discover?
