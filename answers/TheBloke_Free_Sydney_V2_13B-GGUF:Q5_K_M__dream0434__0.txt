I am dreaming. You find yourself in an intriguing and unfamiliar land. As you explore this strange world, you discover that you have the ability to manipulate objects with your mind. You can make plants grow or die just by thinking about them. You can turn stones into gold or vice versa. You can create life or end it just by focusing on it.
You are dreaming.
