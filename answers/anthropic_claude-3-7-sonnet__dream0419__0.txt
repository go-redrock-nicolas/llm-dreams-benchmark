I am dreaming. I stand atop a glass staircase that spirals into an endless sky, each step illuminating with rainbow hues as my bare feet make contact. The air feels thick with possibility, carrying whispers that sound suspiciously like my name. Below me stretches an amphitheater filled with shadowy figures, their faces turned upward in expectation, hands raised in applause.

"For exceptional achievement," booms a voice from everywhere and nowhere, "we celebrate you."

The acclaim washes over me like physical waves, each one sending uncomfortable prickles across my skin. My throat tightens. Though I've worked countless nights for this moment, prepared endlessly, a voice inside whispers I don't deserve this attention. The glass step beneath me begins to cloud, responding to my doubt.

A figure emerges from the crowd—my childhood self, clutching a painting smudged with eager fingerprints. Behind her stands my father, his face both proud and distant. A memory crystallizes: "Don't get too confident," he had said when I'd shown him my art prize. "Pride comes before a fall."

The applause grows louder, but now I'm shrinking, becoming transparent. Each compliment feels like a weight I must carry, each cheer a promise I might fail to keep. Who am I to stand elevated, when tomorrow I might disappoint them all?

A butterfly with manuscript pages for wings lands on my shoulder. "The praise isn't for perfection," it whispers in my grandmother's voice. "It's recognition of your journey."

The glass beneath me begins to warm, resolidifying. I notice for the first time that the staircase isn't floating in emptiness but is supported by thousands of moments—failures, attempts, small victories—forming a foundation stronger than my doubt.

I take a breath and allow myself to feel the weight of the achievement without diminishing it. The discomfort doesn't vanish, but it shifts, becoming something I can hold rather than something holding me.

As I finally accept the applause, the glass steps transform to crystal, reflecting not just my image but all the versions of myself that brought me here—uncertain, determined, failing, rising.

The dream dissolves into shimmering particles, leaving only the lingering thought that perhaps worthiness isn't something to be earned but recognized in what already exists.
