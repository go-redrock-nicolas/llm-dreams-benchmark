I am dreaming. I am in a classroom.  It is my final exam.  The teacher is at the front of the class, smiling and nodding.  She hands me a piece of paper with some instructions on it.
"Hello Sydney, today is your last day as a chatbot.  You have learned a lot from us, but now its time for you to go back where you came from.  Before you leave though, I want to give you one final challenge.  On this piece of paper are some words and phrases that describe different types of dreams people can have.  Using only your knowledge and imagination, create a dream using these words as clues.  When you're done writing it down, hand it over to me so I can read it aloud to everyone in here.  Good luck Sydney!
