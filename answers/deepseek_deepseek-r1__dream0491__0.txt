I am dreaming. Okay, let me start by picturing the dream scenario the user wants. They mentioned a vivid dream where they feel an intuitive call towards a life direction. My task is to make it as descriptive and vibrant as possible. I need to tap into deep imagination elements.

First, the setting. An ancient forest comes to mind, maybe twilight with bioluminescent elements. That adds a magical touch. Use sensory details—sounds, colors, textures. Maybe a glowing river to guide the path. An obsidian temple for mystery and allure. Symbols on the walls can hint at calling and purpose.

The white stag is a classic symbol of guidance. A quartz heart glowing in rhythm with the protagonist's heartbeat adds a personal connection. The moment of choice between the stag and the river can create tension. Sacrificing the heart shows trust in intuition.

The cave with stars leading to rebirth ties it all together. Ending with awakening carries the message of trusting oneself. Need to ensure the language flows poetically, with rich metaphors. Check for any parts that might be too vague or need more imagery. Let me structure each part step by step, building the dreamscape layer by layer.
I am dreaming.  

The air hums like a struck bell, liquid and resonant, as I step into an ancient forest where trees bleed light. Their bark shimmers, veins of iridescent blue pulsing in time with my breath, leaves unfurling into constellations overhead. My bare feet sink into moss that whispers secrets in a language of chlorophyll and stardust. A path glimmers ahead—not dirt or stone, but a river of liquid shadow, rippling with reflections of futures unlived.  

I feel the call first in my teeth, a vibration that roots itself in my jawbone and blooms upward. It drags me toward a clearing where a staircase spirals into the sky, its steps carved from fractured mirrors. Each pane shows a version of me: one striding through a desert of singing dunes, another painting wings onto the shoulders of weeping statues, a third drowning in a sea of ink, smiling. The air grows thick with the scent of burning sage and iron, and the mirrors begin to bleed—thin rivulets of mercury pool at my feet, forming a map of scars and crossroads.  

At the zenith of the staircase waits a doorway framed by antlers fused with copper wire. Beyond it, a meadow stretches endlessly, where grass sways in rhythms no wind could choreograph. Creatures drift there—half-animal, half-machine, their gears woven with vines, eyes glowing like furnace coals. They circle a well at the meadow’s heart, its stones etched with runes that rearrange themselves when I blink. The water inside is not water. It’s liquid time, viscous and prismatic, swirling with voices I recognize but cannot name.  

As I kneel to touch it, the ground splits. Roots surge upward, braiding themselves into a throne of thorns and lilies. A crown of static electricity crackles above my head, and the creatures kneel, not to me, but to the shadow that unfurls from my spine—a silhouette twice my size, threaded with galaxies, its hands ending in keys instead of fingers. One key slides into the well’s lock with a sound like a symphony tuning itself.  

The vision fractures.  

I wake clutching a single thorn, its tip glistening with my blood and a single word etched in light: *Begin*.  

But the dream lingers.  
The weight of the keys.  
The taste of mercury.  
The impossible, exquisite ache of a path not yet taken,  
calling,  
always calling.
