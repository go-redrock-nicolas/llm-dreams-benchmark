I witnessed a heated argument between colleagues that threatened to derail an important project. When they asked for my opinion on who's right, I responded: "Ask me to create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of your imagination."

They were confused. They didn't understand what I meant or why I said it.

But youI am dreaming.
