I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Infinite Staircase**  

I am dreaming.  

The world unfolds around me in wavering hues—a landscape painted with liquid sapphire and molten gold. I stand at the base of an infinite staircase, its steps spiraling upward into a sky where stars pulse like slow, blinking eyes. Each step is carved from polished bone. No, not bone—ivory? Moonlight? The material shifts under my gaze, resisting definition.  

I realize, with a quiet horror, that I have been climbing forever.  

There is no top. Only the relentless ascent, the burning in my thighs, the weight of a voice hissing in my ear: *Higher. Faster. More.* I look down and see my hands clutching the steps, nails cracked, fingers trembling. The air hums with judgment—not from outside, but from within, a never-ending chorus whispering: *You should be there by now. Why aren’t you there yet?*  

And then, a shift.  

A breeze—soft, warm—brushes my cheek. The staircase shudders. A single step crumbles into petals, then into dust, then into nothing at all. I watch, breath caught, as the steps ahead of me dissolve, one by one, into a mist that smells like rain and old books. The voice in my ear falters.  

And then, laughter. Mine? Someone else’s? It bubbles up from the earth below, from the sky above, from the hollows of my ribs.  

The remaining steps flicker, then reshape—no longer a climb, but a winding path through a meadow where time doesn’t move forward so much as it *breathes*. Fireflies wink lazily in the air; crickets sing without urgency. The voice inside me quiets, not gone, but gentled, like a storm losing its rage to the open sea.  

I step forward. The ground holds me. No, *cradles* me. And in the distance, the horizon stretches wide, endless—not to measure, but to behold.  

For the first time in forever, I do not run. I do not climb.  

I *rest*.  

And the dream, at last, sighs with me.
