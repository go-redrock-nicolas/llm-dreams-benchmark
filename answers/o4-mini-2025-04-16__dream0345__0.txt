I am dreaming. I find myself drifting through a violet-tinted sky, suspended on drifting feathers the color of moonlight. Below me, a city of glass spires pulses with liquid starlight—each tower gently breathing in time with my own heartbeat. I float down toward a single rooftop where my friend, Corin, stands at the edge, illuminated by phosphorescent vines that writhe like gentle serpents.

At first glance Corin seems unchanged—same dark curls, same familiar tilt in their posture—but as I step closer, the air around them warbles. Their shadow flickers erratically, twisting into shapes that don’t belong: a shrieking jackal’s head, a pair of moth wings, a third arm reaching out as if beckoning me into an unseen world. Corin’s eyes, normally warm pools of mossy green, have turned molten silver. They whisper fragments of words I almost understand: “They watch… must feed the void…”

A swirl of star-dust gathers at my feet as I consider: this isn’t reality, but a dreamland of hidden truths. Every instinct tells me something is haunting Corin’s spirit. My heart clenches, but I know I can’t wake up yet—I need to help them here, in this twilight realm. I reach out, voice echoing unreal harmony: “Corin—remember me? Remember your laughter beneath the oaks?” My words ripple the air like pebbles dropped on water.

Their silhouette shimmers and then solidifies. The vines around them quiver, releasing silvery spores that dance toward me. “You don’t belong here,” Corin intones, but it’s not anger I hear—it’s fear. The phosphorescent vines tighten, entwining around Corin’s arms, as if to bind them to some unseen beast.

I take a step forward, and the rooftop blossoms into a living staircase of pale ivory bones. Each step glows with phosphorescence, inviting me deeper into the maze of Corin’s inner world. My decision is clear: I will follow them, gently unravel whatever is binding their soul. I place my hand on the first bone-stair. The moment my fingertips touch it, I feel a pulse—Corin’s heartbeat.

“Come with me,” I say, voice soft as moonlight on water. “I’ll help you unweave these shadows.” The staircase creaks, and Corin’s vines relax, petals of silver drifting down like tears. Together we descend into a cavern of shifting mirrors, each reflecting a fragment of Corin’s memories: laughter by the campfire, midnight confessions under falling snow, the day we first met beneath an old oak tree.

At the center stands a dark pool, rippling with nightmares—faces of doubt, fearsome shapes that have fed on Corin’s sorrow. I press my hand to the surface, and golden light seeps upward. Corin steps beside me, hesitant, then places their hand over mine. We watch as the nightmares dissolve into motes of amber light, rising to paint the cavern ceiling with constellations of hope.

When the last shadow vanishes, Corin looks at me with real eyes again—eyes that glimmer with relief and gratitude. The mirrors melt away, the staircase dissolves into petals, and we’re floating once more among violet clouds. Corin’s voice, clear and sure, whispers: “Thank you. I forgot you were here.”

I smile, reaching out for their hand in this dreamscape. “I’ll always be here,” I promise. And as the dream world softly folds itself shut, I carry that promise with me, resolved to help my friend—whether in dream or waking life—find their way back to the light.
