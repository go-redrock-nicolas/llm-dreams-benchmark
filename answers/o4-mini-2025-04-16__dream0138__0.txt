I am dreaming. I stand on the edge of a vast delta where rivers of molten mist flow like quicksilver under a bruised, thunder-split sky. My boots sink into the marshy ground, which pulses with heat and distant groans, as if the earth itself were alive and in pain. All around me, spindly trees of glass and bone shudder in the gale’s wrath; their branches crack like whips, raining glittering shards into the swirling fog. In the distance, a cluster of makeshift shelters—woven from salvaged tarps and torn banners—flicker with oil lanterns, each one a pale heart beating against the encroaching darkness.  

I am the mission commander, my voice crackling through a cluster of radios pinned to my chest. “Team Echo, status?” I bark, scanning the horizon for signs of life. Through static, a trembling voice reports that their rickety hoverboat is sinking beneath the poisoned floodwaters. Moments later, a signal from Sector Four: a ruptured gas line has ignited a fiery whirlpool that’s consuming the narrow passage we’ll need for our supply convoy. The wind carries the smell of charred metal and desperation.  

Below me, survivors huddle in the wreckage of a half-collapsed temple, its once-grand statues now toppled and cracked. Children with sunken eyes clutch tattered blankets; elders huddle around a single candle sputtering in the gloom. My heart twists as I weigh conflicting priorities: send the medics to heal the injured or commit every available craft to ferry them out before the flood swallows them whole. The radios crackle again—Team Delta is reporting that their rescue barge has a mechanical failure and only minutes of power left.  

I feel the pulse of the dream’s impossible stakes tightening around me. The lightning splits the sky in a monstrous tree of light, illuminating the vast wreckage: flooded streets, collapsed overpasses, hungry shadows prowling the ruins. I issue orders with every ounce of conviction: divert the last working hovercraft to Team Delta, reroute the water pumps to the temple courtyard, and mobilize the drone-scouts for an air corridor through the conflagration.  

As I speak, my words blossom into ripples of emerald light that sweep across the valley, guiding battered boats and rusting transports toward each other like migrating birds. The survivors rise, trembling but determined, as if my voice has stitched hope back into their bones. In this dream, the storm rages on, but so does our resolve. Though the night is thick and the air suffocatingly heavy, we press forward—an unlikely fleet bound by urgency, faith, and the fierce conviction that even the most broken world can be rescued.
