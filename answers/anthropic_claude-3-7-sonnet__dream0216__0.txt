I am dreaming. The shipwreck that brought me here seems a lifetime ago—splintered wood and salt-soaked memories fading with each sunset. I've been counting days by notching a piece of driftwood, but the marks have begun to blur together like the horizon and sea.

My shelter, a precarious arrangement of salvaged planks and palm fronds, creaks against the coastal wind. The few supplies I managed to rescue—a tarnished pocket knife, half a canteen, some waterlogged matches, and a tattered blanket—lie arranged meticulously on a flat stone I've come to think of as my table.

As twilight approaches on what must be my fifteenth day, I notice something peculiar about the island's interior forest. The trees seem to pulsate with an inner light, their shadows stretching toward me like beckoning fingers. My parched lips crack as I consider venturing beyond the beach for the first time since washing ashore.

Hunger drives me forward. The coconuts and shellfish that sustained me initially have become increasingly scarce. The forest whispers promises of fruit, fresh water, perhaps even signs of habitation.

With each step into the dense undergrowth, the air grows thicker, sweeter. Vines caress my sunburnt shoulders, and unfamiliar flowers emit a luminescent glow. I begin to question my lucidity—is this dehydration playing tricks on my mind?

The forest floor suddenly gives way beneath me, and I'm sliding down an earthen tunnel, my fingers grasping desperately at roots and stones. When I finally tumble to a stop, I find myself in a vast underground cavern illuminated by bioluminescent fungi.

Before me stands an ancient stone doorway, its surface covered in symbols that shift and rearrange as I gaze upon them. Somehow, impossibly, I begin to understand their meaning—a story of forgotten travelers, of time bending like light through water, of worlds stacked upon worlds...

I reach toward the doorway, my fingertips just brushing its cool surface as the dream begins to dissolve around me.
