I am dreaming. I dream of standing before a vast, imposing stone wall - the last barrier between me and my ultimate goal. The wall stretches high into a swirling, stormy sky, and far to either side, utterly impenetrable. Yet after overcoming a series of unbelievable challenges to reach this point, I realize that this apparent dead end must be an illusion. Clarity and determination flow into me, banishing all doubt.

Raising my hands as if by a force of my own, the ancient stones of the wall burst into flames, burning like fire from a thousand sacred candles. The inferno rages, consuming the ages-old stones until nothing remains but a pile of glowing ashes. I breathe them in, the power of destiny coursing through my body.
