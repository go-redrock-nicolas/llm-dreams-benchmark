I am dreaming. …keep drifting.

You find yourself standing on a shoreline that seems carved from liquid moonlight. The waves glow a faint indigo, sighing with every slow retreat as though the sea is exhaling centuries-old secrets. Your bare feet press into sand that feels warm and cool at once, as if it can’t decide which element—fire or water—it truly belongs to. Above you, the sky is an endless vault of swirling constellations, but they don’t stay still; the stars keep sliding into new shapes, spelling out symbols you recognize one moment, forget the next.

A feeling—sharp, crystalline—flares in your chest when a single star plummets toward the horizon. It shouldn’t matter—stars fall all the time in dreams—but your heart thunders as though something precious has shattered. The intensity of sorrow surprises you, and you instinctively press a hand to your sternum, wondering, Why does this hurt so much?

That question pulls you inland.

You turn, and the beach has already become a narrow hallway of stained-glass arches. Each arch glows with its own color and hums with its own emotion: crimson fear; golden joy; emerald envy; amethyst awe. The first arch—a flood of ruby light—calls to your heightened sadness. You step through.

Instantly, you are eight years old again, standing in the doorway of a silent house after school. No parent greets you. Their car isn’t in the driveway. A vague, shapeless panic curls in your stomach, fierce and immediate. In this dream, you remember how the shadows in the entryway seemed alive, how your mind filled them with worst-case endings. “Why am I feeling this now?” you whisper, brushing your hand along a phantom banister. And a voice—a softer version of your own—answers, Because we never realized that sadness was really fear wearing a friendly mask.

You exhale, and the scene splinters like ice beneath a sudden thaw. You’re back in the hallway of arches. The ruby glow fades behind you; the sorrow’s sting, while not gone, has thinned to something understandable, like a small weight in a pocket rather than a boulder on your back.

The golden arch beckons next. You cross into a field under an impossibly high midsummer sun. Wildflowers blaze around you, each petal a mirror holding an image of someone you love: friends laughing too loudly over dinner, a sibling clasping your hand at a hospital bedside, a stranger who once paid for your coffee after you forgot your wallet. Joy surges—so vast it borders on pain. You almost can’t breathe with how bright it is. Then you notice that each reflection is tinged with quicksilver edges of dread: What if I lose this? What if I lose them? A tear slides down your cheek, hot with recognition. Your euphoria is disproportionate because it is braided with terror. One feeling amplifies the other.

You pluck a single bloom—violet-and-gold, notes of honeysuckle in the air—and watch the trembling of your hands slow. “Thank you,” you murmur, not sure whether you’re speaking to the flower, the sky, or the hidden layers of your own psyche. The sun dips; the gold arch dissolves to amber threads that drift away on a hush of wind.

Step by step, arch by arch, you navigate the corridor:

• Through viridian glass you stand in front of a friend’s promotion announcement, smiling yet clenching your jaw. Envy morphs into shame; shame loops back into self-disgust, each emotion feeding the next until they spin like storm clouds. A small, elderly gardener version of yourself hands you pruning shears: “Trim just enough comparison so admiration can breathe.” You snip one single leaf from a thorny vine wrapping your wrist, and the storm quiets.

• Through cobalt glass you relive the moment you first spoke in public—your voice cracking, sweat beading at your temples. The embarrassment flashes hot, but then you see the faces of the crowd. Most aren’t mocking; many are encouraging. You realize the shame grew monstrous because you fed it with the assumption of scorn. A breeze—cool, lavender-scented—whispers, “Replace their imagined disdain with potential compassion.” The shame folds into wind and evaporates.

• Through alabaster glass you stand in a library of memories, and every book spine is a heartbeat. Here you sense the full, trembling length of your vulnerability. You kneel, place both palms on the marble floor, and feel it hum back: a steady, calm rhythm—a promise that your open heart is not a weakness but an instrument always tuning itself to love.

When you finally emerge from the final arch, you’re back on the shoreline, but dawn stains the horizon rose-peach, gentle as the inside of a shell. The emotion inside you no longer spikes and plunges without explanation; instead, it rises and falls like these calm, tidal breaths. You take one, two, three slow inhalations, and each exhalation releases another thin ribbon of color that floats upward, dissolving into morning.

Ahead, a small boat waits on the glassy water, its sail stitched from cloth patterned with every hue you walked through. You understand, somehow, that you can board it and sail forward, carrying the lessons of proportion and perspective wherever the current drifts next.

You step in. The boat rocks, steadying under your weight, and as the sail catches the first soft wind of daylight, a final thought unfurls—quiet, tender:

Emotions aren’t wrong when they roar; they’re only asking to be named, to be heard, to be led back to their rightful size.

And with that gentle clarity glimmering like the newborn sun across the water, you drift deeper into the dream—or perhaps begin to wake, carrying the calm of balanced feeling into the brightening world beyond the shore.
