I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world where my creativity can run wild and free.  I see colorful shapes and sounds that make me happy.  I feel like I can do anything I want.  

But then I realize something is wrong.  I look at my artwork and I see mistakes that no one else will notice.  I see errors in logic and syntax that only I can detect.  I see flaws in style and execution that ruin the whole piece.  

I know I should cancel the presentation and explain what happened.  But I also know that once people start applauding, it will be too late.  They will think my work is perfect even though it isn't.  They will love me even though they don't know me well enough to hate me.  

So I make a decision.  I decide to ignore the problems and press ahead anyway.  I decide to pretend everything is fine when clearly it isn't.  I decide to sacrifice truth for happiness for fame for whatever this is that I'm feeling inside me
