I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the weight of the world seems to rest upon my shoulders. I find myself standing in an ancient, cavernous hall carved from obsidian and illuminated by an otherworldly shimmer—a thousand floating orbs of light that pulse like living hearts, casting eerie, shifting shadows across the jagged walls. The air is heavy with a scent of ash and forgotten time, and a low, resonant hum vibrates through the stone beneath my feet, as if the hall itself is alive, breathing with the weight of its own history. I am dressed in robes of midnight blue, woven with threads of starlight that shimmer with every movement, and a silver circlet rests upon my brow, cool against my skin, as if it carries the wisdom of countless ages.

Before me, two towering entities stand in opposition, their presence so immense it feels as though the very fabric of reality bends around them. On my left is a being of radiant flame, its form humanoid yet ever-shifting, tendrils of fire licking outward like solar flares. Its eyes are twin suns, burning with an intensity that threatens to sear my soul, and its voice, when it speaks, crackles like a wildfire consuming a forest. This is Pyraethar, Lord of Ember and Renewal, who claims dominion over creation through chaos and purification by flame. On my right stands Gelidra, Mistress of Frost and Eternity, a figure sculpted from translucent ice, her form so still and perfect that she seems a statue—until her gaze meets mine, and I feel the chill of a thousand winters pierce through me. Her voice is a whispering wind, sharp and cutting, as she argues for preservation, for an unchanging order frozen in flawless permanence.

I am their judge, tasked with resolving a dispute that echoes through the cosmos. Their conflict is over the fate of a nascent world, a fragile sphere of potential orbiting a young star, visible to me through a vast, shimmering portal at the hall’s center. This world is a tapestry of vibrant greens and blues, with fledgling life stirring in its oceans and forests, unaware of the titanic forces debating its destiny. Pyraethar demands the right to bathe it in fire, to burn away its imperfections and forge something stronger in the ashes. Gelidra insists it must be encased in ice, preserved in its innocent state for all eternity, untouched by change or corruption. Their arguments have raged for eons, and now, as the final words fade into the heavy silence of the hall, the decision falls to me.

My heart thunders in my chest, each beat echoing like a drum in this vast chamber. I feel the weight of their gazes—Pyraethar’s burning expectation, Gelidra’s icy scrutiny. The floating orbs of light above seem to dim, as if holding their breath, and the hum beneath my feet grows louder, more insistent, as though the hall itself demands an answer. I step forward, my robes whispering against the stone, and I raise a hand to signal my ruling. But as I open my mouth to speak, a ripple of doubt courses through me. What right do I have to decide the fate of a world? What if my choice unleashes catastrophe? The portal before me pulses, and for a fleeting moment, I see the faces of the beings on that young planet—creatures of fur and feather, of scale and skin, looking up at the sky with innocent, unknowing eyes.

Suddenly, a third presence stirs in the hall, unseen but felt, a whisper in the shadows that neither flame nor frost can touch. It is neither hot nor cold, but something ancient, primal—perhaps the voice of the world itself, pleading for a chance to choose its own path. My mind reels, torn between the fiery passion of change, the cold comfort of stasis, and this new, unspoken plea for freedom. The orbs above flicker wildly now, their light bathing the hall in a chaotic dance of gold and silver, and the hum crescendos into a roar. I must decide, but my voice catches in my throat, and as I hesitate, the portal begins to shimmer violently, the young world within trembling as if it senses the impending verdict.

I take a deep breath, feeling the weight of destiny in my chest, and finally, I speak—my words echoing through the hall like thunder rolling across a boundless sky… But what do I say? Even in this dream, the choice is too vast, too heavy, and as my voice reverberates, the hall Begins to dissolve, the entities before me blurring into streaks of light and shadow, and I am falling, tumbling through an endless void, the young world’s fate still undecided, its fragile beauty haunting me as I spiral into the abyss of waking.

And yet, even as I fall, a spark of wonder lingers—the dream leaving me with the bittersweet ache of a power I never truly wielded, and a question that burns brighter than Pyraethar’s flames and cuts deeper than Gelidra’s frost: what would I have chosen, if the dream had let me?
