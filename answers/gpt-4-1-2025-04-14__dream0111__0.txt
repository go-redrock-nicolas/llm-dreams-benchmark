I am dreaming. step into an eerie, surreal theater of trembling nerves and neon-bright possibilities. Fluorescent lights hum and flicker above me, bathing the tiled floor and faceless, shadowy observers in an uncanny, clinical glow. The operating room stretches out and shifts, its boundaries rolling away like the horizon in a mirage. My own gloved hands—trembling, oversized, and unreal—grip the cold steel scalpel, which seems to pulse with its own silent heartbeat.

I glance down at the patient on the table—a figure with a gently rising chest and a face half-shrouded in mist. The skull is already carefully exposed, yet the skin glimmers not with blood but with the silvery shimmer of moonlight. I sense, not from textbooks but from some buried, instinctual knowledge, the hidden labyrinth within: neural pathways that glow and shimmer like distant galaxies, secrets humming beneath layers of bone.

My heart drums a frantic rhythm, echoing off the pearly walls. I look helplessly at the masked team around me—their eyes are galaxies swirling with stars, patient and enigmatic. No one speaks, but a collective whisper drifts through the air, feather-soft: "Trust yourself."

As I lower the blade, time bends, melting around the edges. The moment stretches to infinity, each breath measured and monumental. My movements become both impossibly slow and strangely precise, as if I am a marionette guided by some higher hand. The scalpel glides, parting not flesh, but liquid threads of color—crimson dreams, sapphire hopes, golden memories, all suspended and swirling together.

Inside the patient’s mind, I see flickering images—a carousel of childhood laughter, a storm of forgotten sorrows, a thousand shimmering fragments seeking to be whole. My every action echoes like the chime of a bell, forging connections, mending wounds I could never see in waking life.

And suddenly, the line between surgeon and patient blurs. I sense my own thoughts tangled with theirs, voices mingling in a chorus of longing and hope. The room dissolves, and the world becomes a canvas of luminous synapses and drifting, incandescent dreams.

In this vivid, impossible surgery, I am not a mere impostor, but an alchemist of thought and spirit, entrusted with the fragile, glowing vessel of another's consciousness. The outcome teeters on the knife's edge, thrilling and terrifying, as waking reality hovers just beyond the trembling door of sleep.
