I am dreaming. At first, I’m standing barefoot in an endless field of whispering grass, silvered by moonlight. The wind carries a melody I’ve never heard but somehow know by heart—deep, rhythmic drumming, the hum of a throat singer’s voice curling like smoke in the cold air. My pulse syncs with the beat, and without thinking, I lift my hands, palms facing the sky, just as the figures in the distance do.  

They emerge from the gloom—tall, masked dancers draped in robes of sewn-together shadows and flickering firelight. Their movements are liquid, deliberate, each step imprinting glowing sigils into the earth. I don’t recognize their language, but when they chant, the words settle in my bones like forgotten truths. One dancer turns to me, their mask shifting from wood to smoke to mirrored glass, reflecting not my face but glimpses of places I’ve never been: a sun-baked village coiled around a mountain, a river running backward under a green dawn, a bridge woven from songs.  

"Remember," they murmur without speaking.  

The drum grows louder, shaking the ground. Around us, the field dissolves into a great spiral of floating lanterns, each one flickering with a different memory—not mine, but belonging to generations I’ve never met. I reach out, and as my fingers brush a drifting light, knowledge flashes through me: the taste of sacred bread from a clay oven, the weight of beads braided into hair at a coming-of-age ceremony, the scent of incense curling around midnight prayers.  

I wake with a gasp—but for a moment, just a breath, my hands still smell of smoke and honey, and my heart beats in time with a drum that no one else can hear.
