I am dreaming. I am standing backstage, heart pounding like a war drum in my chest, the air thick with the scent of old wood, dusty velvet curtains, and the faint metallic tang of nervous sweat. The hum of the awaiting crowd vibrates through the walls, a living, breathing entity of anticipation—a beast I must face. This is it, the defining performance of my career, the moment I’ve clawed and bled for through endless nights of practice and sacrifice. I’m clad in a costume that feels both like armor and a second skin, a shimmering cascade of midnight blue and silver that glints like a starry night. My hands tremble as I adjust the delicate mask over my face, its cold porcelain edges pressing into my skin, a barrier between me and the world I’m about to confront. I’ve prepared for this. I’ve lived for this. But as I take a deep breath, ready to step into the blinding light, a sickening realization crashes over me like a tidal wave: my preparation… it’s all wrong. 

Every note I’ve rehearsed, every movement I’ve perfected, every word I’ve memorized—it’s suddenly jumbled, alien, as if I’ve been training for a different play, a different life. My mind scrambles to grasp at the fragments, but they slip through my fingers like sand. Panic blooms in my chest, a poisonous flower unfurling its petals, and I can feel the weight of failure before I’ve even begun. The stage manager hisses my cue through the dark, urgency sharpening his whisper into a blade. There’s no turning back. My legs move on their own, wooden and unsteady, carrying me toward the edge of the curtain as if I’m a marionette jerked by invisible strings.

The spotlight finds me. It’s not just light—it’s a searing, merciless sun, burning away every shadow I could hide in. I squint against its glare, the heat prickling my skin, and for a moment, I’m paralyzed. The crowd is a sea of faceless silhouettes, a roaring ocean of expectation that threatens to drown me. I can feel their eyes, hundreds of them, boring into me, hungry for perfection, ready to feast on any misstep. My mouth opens, but my voice—where is my voice? It’s trapped somewhere deep inside, caged by the realization that I don’t know what I’m supposed to say, what I’m supposed to do. My hands, supposed to gesture with grace, hang limp at my sides, useless. The silence is deafening, heavier than the roar of the crowd, a vacuum that sucks the air from my lungs.

But then, something shifts. From the deepest recesses of my mind, a strange, primal instinct awakens. If I can’t perform what I’ve prepared, I’ll create something new—something raw, something real. My body moves before my mind catches up, a slow, deliberate step forward, as if I’m testing the ground beneath me. I lift my arms, and though they tremble, they carve through the air with a jagged elegance, telling a story I didn’t know I had inside me. My voice, when it finally breaks free, isn’t the polished, rehearsed tone I’d honed—it’s a jagged, haunting wail, a cry of desperation and defiance that echoes off the theater walls. The crowd gasps, a collective intake of breath, and I can feel their energy shift, not condemning but captivated, as if I’ve shattered some unspoken barrier between us.

The stage beneath me begins to transform. The polished wood ripples like water, and I’m no longer in a theater but on the edge of a vast, craggy cliff overlooking a stormy sea. The spotlight becomes a fractured moon, casting silver shards of light across jagged rocks and crashing waves that spray cold mist against my face. My costume flows like liquid night, billowing in a wind that howls with ancient secrets. I’m no longer just performing—I’m summoning something, a force older than time, a story of loss and triumph that pours from me in waves of raw emotion. My voice weaves with the wind, my movements dance with the storm, and the crowd is no longer just an audience—they’re part of this wild, untamed dreamscape, their gasps and murmurs blending with the thunder.

I don’t know how long I perform. Time melts away, stretching into eternity and collapsing into a single heartbeat. When the storm finally calms, the sea stills, and the cliff fades back into the wooden stage, I’m left breathless, trembling under the spotlight once more. The silence returns, but it’s different now—pregnant with awe. Then, like a dam breaking, applause erupts, a tidal wave of sound that crashes over me, lifting me higher than I’ve ever been. I stand there, chest heaving, mask slick with sweat and tears, realizing that my wrong preparation didn’t ruin me—it remade me. I’ve given them something they’ve never seen, something I didn’t even know I could give. As the curtain begins to fall, I catch a glimpse of my reflection in the polished stage floor—a stranger, a creator, a survivor—and I know this moment, this dream, will echo in me forever.
