I am dreaming. …blink awake inside a colossal observatory whose dome roof has been pried open like the lid of a silver seashell. For years—at least in waking life—you have been the revered master of classical astronomy: sextants, brass orreries, starcharts inked on vellum. Yet the vast rotunda around you is unrecognizable. Every familiar instrument has dissolved into sleek, translucent lattices of crystal and luminous glyphs that flit through the air like fireflies.  

Your beloved orrery now resembles a living, quivering sphere made of liquid equations. Constellations, once locked into parchment grids, reorder themselves every second, pulsing to some cryptic rhythm. An amphitheater of silent onlookers—humanoid silhouettes stitched from midnight sky—waits for you to demonstrate mastery of these alien tools. The weight of their expectation hums in your chest.

Panic skitters across your mind: the old skills that defined you are fossils in this place. Sextant? Antiquity. Ephemeris tables? Museum pieces. You feel your identity cracking like ice beneath sudden sunlight.

But this is a dream, and you remember the dreamer’s prerogative: to reshape or be reshaped. You inhale deeply. Instead of air you draw in stardust—sharp, metallic, electric on the tongue. It seeps through your veins, prying open neural gates you never knew existed. You reach toward the liquidequation sphere. At your touch it ripples, projecting an aurora of possibilities: spiraling math, synesthetic chords of color, whispered fragments of languages spoken by quasars.

You relinquish the comfort of expertise and step into apprenticeship again, but this time your teacher is Intuition in its rawest form. You trace a sigil in the air; it becomes a hovering line of light. You sing a note; it blossoms into a tetrahedron that orbits your brow like a crown. Patterns bloom with every gesture: you’re learning, or perhaps remembering, a discipline that transcends disciplines—a cartography of wonder.

The audience of skystitched beings leans forward. Encouraged, you push further. You summon the vestiges of your old craft not as authority but as fertilizer for new growth. Where sextants once measured angles, your fingertips now measure probability amplitudes, plucking them like harp strings. Where charts once captured fixed stars, your breath blows open wormholes to newborn galaxies.

Suddenly the dome quakes. The entire observatory tilts, transforming into a gigantic kaleidoscope. Lenses of crystal slide into alignment, and beams of prismatic light spear outward, painting the heavens with fresh constellations that you yourself coauthor in real time. Each burst of color imprints the sky with symbols of change: a phoenix nested in a Möbius strip; a labyrinth whose walls rearrange as you walk; an hourglass forever flipping itself.

The silhouettes roar in silent applause, their edges flickering like candle flames in a breeze. You feel no triumph rooted in ego—only the giddy buoyancy of adaptation. Your identity, once a monolith carved in stone, is now a river: supple, shimmering, unstoppable.

A bell—clear as glacial water—rings overhead. The dream begins to frost at the edges. As shapes dissolve, you clutch one final revelation: expertise is not a fortress to defend but a ship to sail beyond the map’s edge. When new worlds rise from the deep, you will greet them barefoot on the deck, pockets full of stardust, compass thrown joyfully to the sea.

With that thought, you wake—heart hammering, eyes ablaze—ready to apprentice yourself to the next impossible horizon.
