I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and jasmine, the kind of perfume that lingers just before a storm. The sky is a bruised purple, streaked with veins of gold where the sun struggles to break through. I stand in a garden—no, not a garden, a labyrinth. The hedges are towering, their leaves whispering secrets in a language just beyond my grasp.  

Then, I see *them*—the person whose life is about to fracture. They’re laughing, carefree, plucking a ripe pomegranate from a low-hanging branch. The juice stains their fingers crimson, like fate itself has marked them. And I know. I *know* the truth. It coils inside me, a serpent of dread, heavy and venomous.  

A letter materializes in my hands, the paper brittle as dried petals. The ink bleeds through, words forming and dissolving before I can read them, but the meaning sears into my mind. *If they find out, it will destroy them.* The wind picks up, carrying the sound of their laughter again, but now it’s fraying at the edges, unraveling into something desperate.  

I try to speak, to warn them, but my voice is gone. The labyrinth shifts, the hedges tightening like a noose. Shadows stretch long and hungry, reaching for their unsuspecting form. I want to scream, to tear the knowledge from my skull and bury it deep where it can never hurt them—but dreams are cruel. They make you hold the weight of futures that haven’t happened yet.  

And then I wake, gasping, the taste of pomegranate still on my tongue.
