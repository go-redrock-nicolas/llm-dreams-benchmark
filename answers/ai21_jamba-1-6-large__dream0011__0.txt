I am dreaming. I am about to take the final exam for a course that determines my future career. As I sit down to start the exam, I notice the questions are printed in bold black ink on a crisp piece of white paper. The questions are short and direct, but as I begin reading, I realize they're written in a foreign language that I've never seen before. The symbols and characters look familiar, like a mixture of ancient Greek and hieroglyphics, but I can't make any sense of them.

I start to panic as I try to flip through the exam booklet, hoping to find some clue or context. But the pages all have the same bizarre symbols, like some kind of alien code. I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of confusion and frustration. 

And then suddenly, I hear a voice in my head that sounds calm and reassuring. "Don't worry," it says. "You already know the answers." 

"What?" I say out loud, looking around for the source of the voice. But there's no one else there. I can't see anyone except for a small figure standing in the corner of the room, holding a clipboard and watching me with a puzzled expression.

I look down at my exam booklet again and suddenly, it all becomes clear. The symbols and characters have transformed into something I understand completely. It's like a spark ignites in my brain, and I know exactly what to do.

I start writing furiously, answering each question with ease. The voice in my head is still talking to me, guiding me through the questions and making sure I don't miss a single detail. 

As I finish the exam, I feel a wave of relief and satisfaction. I know I've done well, and I'm proud of myself for not giving up when things seemed impossible.

I turn in my exam and walk out of the classroom with a sense of accomplishment. I look back at the figure in the corner, who is still holding the clipboard. But now I can see that she's holding a bouquet of flowers instead of a clipboard.

She hands me the flowers and smiles. "Congratulations," she says. "You passed."

As I walk away from the classroom, I feel a weight lift off my shoulders. I knew I could do it all along.
