I am dreaming. …lean closer, and the sound of my own heartbeat harmonizes with the low, unearthly hum of the device.

I stand beneath a sky the color of bruised violets, on a ledge carved into the side of a colossal cliff whose surface ripples like liquid obsidian. Far below, a tide of molten sand roars and seethes, climbing higher with every breath I take, threatening to devour this narrow perch. The only hope of escape is the machine before me—a massive conglomeration of tarnished bronze and black crystal, half-buried in the cliffside as though it had slept there for millennia.

The main body resembles an enormous astrolabe twisted inside-out, rings within rings turning slowly on unseen axles. Between the rings, glassy prisms hover inexplicably, floating in precise orbits like silent fireflies frozen in amber. Strange sigils creep over the metal surfaces, glowing and dimming in pulses that remind me of deep ocean bioluminescence. I realize each glow is in perfect sync with the beating of my heart, as though the contraption is studying me just as intently as I am studying it.

Somewhere behind, the sand boils upward with a hiss—time is slipping sideways. I brush my fingers over the nearest ring; it is surprisingly warm, almost alive. The moment my skin meets the metal, a thin seam appears, opening like eyelids across the machine. Inside the crack sits a tiny silver sphere, no larger than a seed, rotating furiously. Reflected in its surface, I glimpse a version of myself standing in calm daylight on a field of grass. The vision vanishes as quickly as it appears.

A thought stirs: this must be a key, but a key to what? Around the sphere radiate six pathways of etched grooves, each ending at a socket shaped like various symbols—crescent moon, spiral shell, shattered star, and three I cannot name. My intuition buzzes. Perhaps each pathway is a circuit, and the sphere is meant to race through the correct one.

My fingers tighten, but the sand’s roar grows louder. A golden grain leaps over the edge and lands beside my boot, sizzling like a coal. I exhale slowly, letting fear turn into focus. I observe the pulses in the sigils—one sequence glows in an unmistakable pattern: three short flares, a long fade, three quick sparks. Morse? An ancient heartbeat? I match the rhythm with my own breath, touching the grooves that flare at the same cadence. As I do, the grooves widen, forming channels.

Instinct guides me to pluck the silver sphere from its nest. The instant it leaves, it grows hotter yet lighter, like holding a tiny sun made of feathers. I set it at the mouth of the first channel that resonates with the pulse pattern. It rolls of its own accord, clicking across miniature teeth inside the groove, leaving a trail of opalescent light. Halfway through, the entire machine vibrates, rings accelerating, prisms whistling like wind chimes trapped in a current.

But then the sphere stalls; the pulse skips. I realize the rhythm has changed—my heartbeat has quickened in panic. I clamp my eyes shut, force a steadier tempo, and the glyphs echo the adjustment. The sphere resumes its journey, finds a hidden gear at the circuit’s end, and snaps into place. A thunderous clang echoes, and the rings align perfectly, forming a vast open aperture that frames the night sky.

A pillar of cool emerald light erupts from the core, spearing through the aperture and out into the heavens. The molten sand below freezes mid-surge, turning into clear glass that fractures and crumbles harmlessly. The cliff stabilizes; the storm of doom hushes. I sense freedom blooming on the other side of the aperture—perhaps another realm, or the waking world itself.

Not daring to wait, I step onto the nearest ring, now acting as a luminous gangway, and let the emerald light lift me. The last thing I feel is the machine’s hum melding into birdsong, the violet sky dissolving into sunrise pink. And just as I cross the threshold, I swear the device whispers, in a voice equal parts thunder and lullaby, “Well done, dreamer—remember the rhythm.”

Then everything turns weightless—and I awaken.
