I am dreaming. …I draw in a breath and let it out slowly, watching it billow before me like silver mist—even though I am indoors, even though the air is warm. Everything here feels impossibly clear, as though the world has been polished by moonlight: the mahogany of the stage gleams with an inner river of starlight, the curtains ripple like dark red oceans, and every eye in the grand amphitheater seems lit with its own lantern-flame.

My pulse becomes the opening drumroll, echoing through the cavernous hall. I step to the podium, yet it isn’t a podium at all. As my fingers brush it, the wood liquefies into glassy water, rippling outward in circles that shimmer with iridescent colors. From those ripples rise delicate lily pads instead of pages. Each pad bears a single, pulsing rune—my speech, alive, ready to be spoken.

The microphone blooms from the water like a midnight lotus. Its petals unfold to reveal a crystal heart that hums with my unspoken words. I lean closer, and the heart glows brighter, awaiting the first syllable.

“Good evening,” I begin, and my voice leaves my mouth as a murmuration of tiny, glowing moths. They flutter out to the audience, drifting over their heads like a galaxy remapping itself. Wherever a moth lands, it folds its wings and becomes a gently flickering lamp, illuminating a face, a smile, a pair of widened eyes.

I speak again, and this time sentences spool into silvery ribbons that twist above, forming constellations. They hang there like shimmering calligraphy, and people gaze upward, tracing the shapes with their fingertips as if drawing wisdom down from the sky.

A hush spreads, soft as velvet. I feel them leaning forward, drinking in the dream. I want to tell them about courage, so I close my eyes and think of mountains. When I open them, a colossal peak rises at my back: snow dusts its razor crest, eagles arc across its slopes, and veins of sunrise fire run through its granite skin. Every word about bravery I utter chisels another handhold in that sheer face, and countless climbers—small as sparks—begin their ascent, pulled upward by the promise of my sentences.

I want to speak of hope. Instantly, a single seed floats down, glowing amber. It touches the lake-podium, and the water flashes green. In the audience, rows of seats transform into rolling hills, and each person now sits in a small coracle made of woven reeds. As my voice flows forward, the hills sprout orchards in fast-motion bloom, branches dripping with fruit larger than suns yet light as soap bubbles. Audience members reach up, pluck a glimmering peach of possibility, and bite in; the juice runs like liquid dawn.

Suddenly the roof of the amphitheater dissolves. Above us spirals an aurora that sings in harmonies. My speech has turned to music—notes like comets streaking, chords rumbling like distant thunder, melodies threading through the crowd’s heartbeats until we all share one vast, resonant cadence.

I pause and listen. The silence that follows feels holy. An entire universe balances on that hush. Then someone in the back stands. A small child? An ancient sage? Both? They bow, and the rest of the audience follows, a wave of gratitude crashing forward in soft applause that sounds like rain on leaves. Every clap releases feathers that drift upward, turning into constellations of swans.

Tears blur my vision—not of fear, but of realization: this dream isn’t mine alone. It’s a collective imagining forming itself through me. I decide to speak one more word. Just one. A word large enough to wrap around every soul present but gentle enough to rest in a single palm.

“Remember.”

As it leaves my lips, the hall erupts into a slow-motion supernova. The light expands, unfurls, fractures into prismatic petals, and when it touches each listener, it condenses into a tiny, glowing marble they fold into their hearts. The stage dissolves completely, and I am suddenly standing on nothing but warm, sighing wind. The audience rises with me, each seat becoming a paper lantern lifting skyward.

Together we drift, luminous specks amid a canvas of indigo dream. I feel weightless, endless, bound to each person by invisible filaments of shared wonder. The speech is over, yet it has no ending, because it echoes in every lantern, every marble, every marble’s memory of light.

The scene begins to fade. Colors soften, outlines blur, and the hush grows deeper, warmer. I sense waking on the horizon like pink dawn. Before it arrives, the dream takes my hand and whispers a final image: a single doorway made of moonbeams, standing open on an ocean of clouds.

I step through—and awaken, the taste of stars still shimmering on my tongue.
