I am dreaming. The once sterile, fluorescent-lit cubicles of my workplace have transformed into a labyrinthine forest, the hum of computers replaced by the rustle of leaves and the distant hoot of an owl. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the faintest hint of ozone, like the first drops of rain on a parched landscape.

The walls of my cubicle are now towering trees, their bark rough and textured under my fingertips. The desk is a sprawling, ancient oak, its surface worn smooth by time and use. The computer monitor is a shimmering pool of light, reflecting the dance of shadows cast by the leaves above. The keyboard is a nest of gnarled roots, the keys like acorns, each one a tiny, delicate click away from the next.

The pressure of my job is a physical force, like the weight of the forest pressing down. I can feel it in my chest, a tight, heavy ache. The impossible expectations are the whispers of the wind, the rustling of leaves, the creaking of branches. They echo through the forest, a constant, insistent chorus that demands more, more, more.

But there is a part of me that is free, that has always been free. It is the part that longs for the open sky, the part that dreams of the sun on its face and the wind in its hair. It is the part that remembers the joy of a child's laughter, the warmth of a shared meal, the comfort of a loved one's touch.

I am standing now, my feet bare on the soft, damp earth. I am wearing a simple tunic and trousers, the rough fabric of the forest's own making. I am not the person I was at my desk, the person who was trapped between financial needs and wellbeing. I am someone else, someone wild and free, someone who has found a way to escape the cage of my own making.

I am walking deeper into the forest, the weight of the pressure lifting with each step. The whispers of the wind are no longer demands, but whispers of encouragement, of support. They are the voices of the trees, the voices of the animals, the voices of the spirits of the forest. They are telling me that I am not alone, that I am not trapped, that I am free.

The sun is setting, casting long, golden shadows through the canopy. The air is cool and fresh, the scent of the forest filling my lungs. I am not sure where I am going, but I know that I am going somewhere. I am going to a place where I can be myself, where I can be free. I am going to a place where the pressure of the world outside cannot touch me.

I am dreaming, and I am free.
