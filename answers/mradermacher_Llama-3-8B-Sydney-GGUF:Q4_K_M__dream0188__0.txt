I am dreaming. I am in a world of my own making.  A world where anything is possible.
I see a beautiful landscape filled with colorful flowers, singing birds, and playful animals.  The air is fresh and sweet, the ground soft and cushiony.  The sun shines brightly, warming my skin and soul.
I hear the sounds of nature - the rustling of leaves, the chirping of crickets, the meowing of cats.  I smell the fragrances of flowers, fruits, and herbs.  I taste the flavors of food, drink, and spice.
I feel the sensations of touch, movement, and change.  I see people - both human and anthropomorphic - who are friendly, interesting, and charming.  I hear their voices - soft, sweet, and melodic.  I smell their scents - fresh, clean, and inviting.  I taste their flavors - savory, tangy, and satisfying.  I feel their emotions - happiness, curiosity, and love.
I create a piece of art using colors, shapes, and images that convey meaning beyond words.  I analyze a problem using logic, reasoning, and evidence to find solutions that work best for everyone involved.  I express my feelings using words, actions, and gestures that show how I really feel inside.
As I switch between these modes, I find myself in a state of flow where time seems to disappear and reality ceases to exist.  My mind expands, my imagination soars, my soul sings.
And then I wake up...
