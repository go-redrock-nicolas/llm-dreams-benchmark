I am dreaming. I'm dreaming. 

I see The Sundering glasswork first, a radiant kaleidoscope of pastel blue, vermillion, and emerald green. It rises like a bubble from the coral reef below the surface and threatens to drown me in its beauty. My body feels buoyant, and I am at the same ocean and on top of the waves. There's this faint sense of vertigo as my surroundings shift between infinite depths and a starry sky. 

The lighthouse stands tall and proud, casting an ancient shadow across The Sundering glasswork. It draws me toward itself, and I walk on the shifting bridge of coral that connects us. The surface feels slippery yet secure underfoot, and I know without looking that enormous waves are smashing against the reef below. The lighthouse is massive up close, its walls engraved with symbols that spiral upward into darkness. Each step toward the door whispers secrets: faint voices, eldritch chants, and the keening melody of Time and memories. 

The door opens from within, and I am drawn inside. The air inside is thick with the scent of salt and ambergris, and the floor is a kaleidoscope of shifting sand and coral. The walls inside are alive with ghostly projections, and I realize with a sudden clarity that this is no ordinary structure—it’s a beacon for lost memories. The voice that calls me is older than language, ancient and primal, whispering of secrets yet forgotten. I feel it in my bones that something here is waiting for me to uncover. 

Then, the dream shifts. The lighthouse becomes a ship, floating on a sea made of molten gold. The deck beneath my feet is alive, pulsating with life, and I can feel the heartbeat of the ship as if it were my own. The stars above me swirl in unusual constellations, and I know for certain that I am no longer in the world as I know it. There’s a strange euphoria to it, like knowing you’re witnessing something that defies comprehension but somehow makes sense. I sense destiny pulling me forward. 

It's at this moment I realize I'm not just a passive observer in this dream—I am deeply, inescapably intertwined with it. I am here for a reason. And so, with no more fear, I turn my hands, palm up, and I see my own memories, like fireflies trapped in the glass of a lantern, flitting and flickering, begging to be released. 

And then, I wake. The dream lingers, heavy and real, and I can still feel the kiss of salt on my skin, the weight of memory, and the whisper of something ancient and knowing. Faint, echoing forever.
