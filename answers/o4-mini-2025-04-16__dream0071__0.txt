I am dreaming. You drift on silken clouds of opal and rose, each breath drawing in the scent of starlight. As you wander this impossible sky-scape, a sudden avalanche of insight floods your mind: you know the secret language of blooming moons, the arcane geometry of shifting shadows, the way sound can be woven into living tapestry. Muscles you never trained ripple with new strength, your hands unfurl streams of color that paint the air itself.

Ahead of you, a column of faceless figures gathers upon a floating terrace carved from translucent quartz. They turn expectantly as you approach, voices rising in a soft chorus: questions half-spoken, pleas for direction. When others turn to you as an unexpected authority, you feel an electric thrill—your heart beats in time with the pulsing mosaic beneath your feet. At your fingertips appears a luminous map of constellations, each star a node in a vast web of destinies.  

You trace a finger along a silver thread, and the map responds: a cascade of light arrows blooms outward, revealing hidden pathways across continents that have never existed. In that instant, you know how to heal ancient wounds and open locked gates in the human spirit. The assembled crowd leans forward, their eyes alight with hope.  

With a single breath you summon a corridor of living glass that arches over the terrace. Through it, shimmering figures step forth—creatures of folklore reborn: a wolf with prismatic fur, a child crowned in living vines, a scholar whose robes morph into fluttering text. They bow to you, and their presence weaves into your newfound lore: you speak a word of power, and the glass bridge becomes a highway of blossoms and light, carrying the crowd toward a distant horizon where rolling hills are strewn with giant lanterns.

As you lead them, each step reveals another miracle: the earth beneath your feet hums in gratitude, wildflowers unfurl like fireworks, and the sky ripples into a thousand new dawns. In this moment you understand—true authority is born not of force, but of the gift to illuminate what was hidden, to open doors with a thought, and to turn strangers’ fears into shared wonder.

Then, just as the lantern-strewn horizon swallows you whole, a soft alarm echoes in your mind. The terrace dissolves, the crowd fades to stardust, and you find yourself suspended at the edge of waking. You hover between the vivid dreamworld’s pulse and the hush of morning light. As your eyes flutter open, the last glow of that endless sky lingers at the back of your eyelids—and you carry its echo into the day, a secret map of possibility.
