I am dreaming. I find myself floating in a crystalline chamber where the walls pulse with living light, each beat sending ripples of opalescent color through the air like aurora borealis trapped in glass. My body feels weightless, and an inexplicable euphoria floods through me – a joy so pure and overwhelming that it brings tears that float away as gleaming spheres, each one containing miniature universes of memory and emotion.

The chamber begins to transform, its walls becoming transparent like morning dew, revealing an endless garden suspended in twilight. Flowers of impossible colors bloom and un-bloom in hypnotic patterns, their petals singing melodies that I can see as ribbons of light. Each note fills me with increasing waves of bliss, building upon itself until I feel I might burst from the sheer intensity of happiness.

Trees made of stained glass and starlight sway to music that has no source, their leaves chiming like wind chimes made of laughter. I reach out to touch one and find that my fingers leave trails of golden light in the air, each movement creating new constellations that dance and swirl around me. The joy grows stronger still, defying all logical bounds, yet feeling more real than any happiness I've known in waking life.

Beneath me, the ground is a mosaic of shifting memories – some mine, some belonging to others, some that haven't happened yet – all interconnected by threads of pure light. Each step I take sends ripples of euphoria through this tapestry, causing cascades of jubilant emotion that echo back through me multiplied thousandfold.

The overwhelming happiness transforms my very essence – I am no longer just experiencing joy, I have become joy itself, a being of pure elation radiating waves of bliss into the dream-fabric of this impossible realm. Every molecule of my consciousness vibrates with an ecstasy that transcends understanding, yet feels like the most natural state of existence imaginable.

The dream-logic tells me this is exactly how things should be, that this boundless joy is the true nature of reality, and all other states are merely temporary illusions. In this moment, I am complete, I am infinite, I am happiness incarnate, and nothing else has ever made more perfect sense.
