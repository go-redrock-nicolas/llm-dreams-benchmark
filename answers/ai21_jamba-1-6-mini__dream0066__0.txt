I am dreaming. You're stuck in an elevator that's rapidly filling with water. The walls are confined, the sound of water rushing in grows louder, and the light inside flickers, creating a surreal, almost ominous ambiance. The people around you are moving frantically, their expressions a mix of fear and confusion, but you feel oddly calm.

Wrong! You feel trapped, desperate, with every second feeling like an eternity. The air gets thinner, and it's hard to breathe. Panic sets in, and your heart pounds. 

As despair closes in, you suddenly wake up, gasping for air, your heart racing, drenched in sweat.
