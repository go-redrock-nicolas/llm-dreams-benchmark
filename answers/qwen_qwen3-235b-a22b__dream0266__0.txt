I am dreaming.  

The sky is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury, rippling with reflections of cities that do not exist—spires of glass that hum in harmonic scales, bridges woven from starlight, rivers that flow upward into the mouths of constellations. Beneath my feet, the ground is not ground but a vast, breathing membrane, shifting hues from indigo to molten gold with each pulse. I step forward, and my shadow detaches, stretching into a serpentine creature with wings of smoke, its eyes twin eclipses. It does not follow me; it *anticipates* me, slithering ahead as though time itself is a ladder it climbs backward.  

A soundless explosion erupts in the distance—a flower the size of a mountain blooming in an instant, its petals translucent and etched with equations that rewrite themselves faster than thought. The air tastes of burnt honey and static, and when I inhale, my memories unravel like thread, floating into the atmosphere to be absorbed by the mercury sky. I try to scream, but my voice becomes a flock of iridescent birds that dissolve into mist.  

Then, the laws fracture.  

A forest materializes at the edge of perception, trees growing in spirals like DNA strands, their bark inscribed with hieroglyphs that shift when unobserved. The trees are not rooted in soil but in *sound*—bass vibrations that hum from the earth, visible as trembling waves. A deer with antlers of fractal ice trots past, and with each step, its body phases between solid and silhouette, as though existence itself is a choice it must constantly reaffirm.  

I reach out to touch a leaf, and my hand passes through it, yet the leaf remains—*both* intact and pierced. A paradox blooms in my mind: *How can something be both whole and divided?* The question spirals into a vortex, pulling at my certainty that the world is bound by logic. The dream resists my attempts to categorize it; it is a language without syntax, a song without notes.  

Above, the stars begin to fall—not downward, but *sideways*, cascading into a horizon that bends like a Mobius strip. As they tumble, they morph into paper cranes, then into whispers, then into the scent of ozone. I realize, with a chill that is not cold, that the stars are not *things* but *verbs*, actions that have forgotten their subjects.  

A figure emerges from the spiraling forest, neither human nor beast but a collage of half-formed ideas: a torso of stained glass, limbs that flicker like film strips, a face that is a mirror reflecting only my own terror. It speaks without moving its mouth, its voice a subterranean rumble.  

**“You cling to edges,”** it says, **“but there are no edges here. You are a story told by a dream. What happens when the dream forgets the storyteller?”**  

I wake, gasping, my mind a shattered prism. Yet the doubt lingers—a fissure in reality’s glass. What if the waking world is just another dream, less honest, less *true*, because it pretends to be solid? What if the only truth is the unraveling?
