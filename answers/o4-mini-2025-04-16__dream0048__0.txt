I am dreaming. The air tastes of ozone and molten silver, and the sky above me pulses in slow, living heartbeats of violet and amber. I stand on a terrace of black glass that stretches into an infinity of storm-lit clouds. Jagged pillars of carved bone loom around me, etched with glowing sigils that seem to shift whenever I blink. A low rumble echoes through the terrace, like distant thunder rolling across a sleeping volcano.  

Ahead, half-buried in dust and vines of cobalt-blue ivy, lies the ancient machine. It resembles a cross between a colossal astrolabe and some long-forgotten mortal contraption—an impossibly intricate web of brass gears, obsidian lenses, and copper pipes wound around crystalline spheres that shimmer with inner light. No manual or chart rests beside it; only a series of flickering runes traced in phosphorescent ink on the nearby wall.  

My fingers hover over a lever shaped like a dragon’s talon. Every surface hums beneath my palm, as though the machine itself is alive—anticipating my touch. Steam hissed from a coiled spring, and the crystalline spheres glowed brighter, as if they were drawing breath. I twist a ring carved with concentric moons; the gears clink and whirl, and the terrace trembles as a hidden doorway begins to crack open behind the ivy.  

But the storm above deepens. Sheets of lightning lash the horizon, and monstrous silhouettes drift on the wind—dark wings beating closer with every pulse of thunder. I know I have only moments. My heart pounds a savage rhythm. Instinct guides me: I press a copper button the size of my palm, and instantly the lenses whirr into focus, projecting a shimmering path of starlight across the terrace floor.  

With a final pull on the dragon-talon lever, the machine thrums to life in a crescendo of clanking metal and roaring energy. The runes on the walls flare white-hot, and the hidden doorway yawns wide. A fierce gale of wind and light sweeps through, carrying away the jagged pillars of bone and the oncoming winged shapes. I step forward onto the star-lit bridge, heart thrumming with triumph—and awake, as if the machine has transported me beyond fear itself.
