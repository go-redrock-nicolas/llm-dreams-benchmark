I am dreaming. I have conjured up a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination:

I am standing in a vast, open field of scorching sand and silky gold. The sky above is painted with a cluster of swirling clouds in shades of deep blue and purplish hues. Nearby, past the reaches of the sand, there is a strange structure that seems to stretch and twist in ways not possible in the physical world.

In the distance, a homophobic family member who deeply hurt me approaches. My heart beats rapidly as a wave of anger seeps through my chest. I clench my fists, imagining throwing them out into the scorching sand for what they did. But I pause, and backing away, I give myself space to breathe. I did not invite them here into my dreams. I am in control here.

Turned, I walk into the unknown building, and just inside the doorway, I find my deceased grandmother. We embrace and she leads me through a labyrinth of twisting tunnels until we arrive at a window looking out into the open sky. On a fluffy cloud, my family member is standing there, insulting the beauty of my sexuality.

I feel the anger seething out of my skin, my blood boiling and fire rising from my fingertips. I shoot a stream of fire across the sky until my family member is engulfed, falling towards the sand.
