I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**  

You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, twilight-coated ballroom, its high ceilings lost in swirling clouds of indigo smoke. Chandeliers drip with melted candle wax that never seems to hit the ground, hovering like golden tears frozen in time. The air hums with the faint, discordant melody of a music box playing just out of sync—somewhere between a waltz and a whispered secret.  

The guests are faceless yet shimmering, their forms rippling like heat off desert sands. They move in slow motion, their murmured conversations dissolving into the scent of old books and bitter coffee. You can’t shake the dread coiling in your stomach, a black vine creeping up your ribs—this event is inevitable, but something about it feels *wrong*, like the room itself is holding its breath.  

Then, the hush breaks. Across the hall, a door you hadn’t noticed before creaks open, revealing a hallway lined with mirrors. Each reflection you glimpse is *yours*, but distorted—one with hollowed-out eyes, another smiling too wide, another flickering like static. One mirror shatters as you pass, and from the cracks spills not glass, but black feathers that dissolve into smoke before they touch the floor.  

A voice—your own, but underwater—whispers: *"You’re afraid of what you’ll see when the masks come off."*  

Suddenly, a hand grazes your shoulder. You turn to find a figure cloaked in moth-eaten velvet, their face obscured by a porcelain mask… one that slowly cracks apart to reveal not skin, but an endless spiral of keys, each one rusted shut.  

You wake with a gasp, the lingering taste of metal on your tongue. Outside your window, the first birds of dawn scream like breaking glass.  

(The echoes of the dream cling to you all morning. That night, you RSVP *yes* to the event—not despite the dream, but because of it. The keys, you realize, were always in your hands.)
