I am dreaming. I find myself in a cavernous chamber hewn from opalescent crystal, where ancient light dances across faces both familiar and strange. Before me sit two delegations at a table that seems to shift and flow like liquid mercury - one side radiating a deep crimson aura, the other pulsing with waves of azure light. Their forms flicker between human and ethereal, their voices echoing with the weight of generations.

As they speak, their words materialize as glowing symbols that spiral through the air, each demand leaving trails of shimmering conflict. The crimson faction insists on claiming the very stars themselves, while the azure side demands dominion over time's eternal flow. Their incompatible desires create a discordant symphony that makes reality itself shudder.

Suddenly, I realize my hands have become translucent, and through them, I can see the true heart of their conflict - not in their words or demands, but in a shared wound that bleeds golden light, a ancient pain that predates their division. As I reach toward this revelation, the crystal walls begin to sing in haunting harmonies, and the delegates' forms start to merge and separate like oil and water...

The dream shifts, and now we're all floating in a sea of memories, where I can taste their shared history like honey and ash on my tongue. Their centuries of hostility swirl around us in ribbons of light and shadow, and I open my mouth to speak the truth I've glimpsed...
