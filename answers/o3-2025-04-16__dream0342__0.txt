I am dreaming. …am suddenly walking through a city that seems to float halfway between dawn and twilight, its skyscrapers translucent like giant dragonfly wings. The pavement pulses softly beneath my bare feet, as though the whole metropolis is alive and humming with dream-energy. Neon vines climb the façades, blooming with flowers that glow electric violet; every blossom exhales a faint chime instead of a scent.

At my side hangs a familiar object: a single-serve coffee capsule dispenser, sleek, silver, and the size of a slim messenger bag. In waking life I never leave home without a couple of those throw-away pods—they pop neatly into my countertop machine, brew in thirty seconds, and let me race to work on an espresso-fueled pulse. In the dream I sling the dispenser effortlessly, hardly noticing its weight.

But as I stroll, a strange gravity tugs me down an alley of mirrored bricks. One reflective wall blurs, turns liquid, and shapes itself into a window—a cinema screen for one. On it plays a wordless reel: thousands of glossy capsules, just like mine, tumbling off assembly lines, rattling into cardboard boxes, flying across oceans in carbon-belching cargo ships. When they reach the end of their usefulness, they clatter into landfills and snap like tiny metallic seeds into riverbeds. The rivers cut to the sea, where turtles mistake shimmering pods for jellyfish. A turtle’s mouth opens—then film burns to white.

The alley’s floor suddenly sags and I tumble into a subterranean chamber. The capsules I carry rupture mid-fall, scattering around me until the ground is a planet of spent aluminum shells. They flash in stroboscopic bursts, each glint whispering the hidden costs: mined bauxite, smelted ore, fossil-fuel furnaces, coal-fired power, microplastic filter nets. With every gleam, I feel myself shrinking, as though the sheer scale of damage has sucked the oxygen out of the dream.

I try to shake off the guilt with the usual protest: “They’re so convenient—I recycle when I can—surely my handful can’t matter that much.” But the dream has no patience for half-truths. A wind roars up, howling in the voice of dispossessed forests, and scatters the empty pods into a swirling cyclone of chrome confetti. A single pod floats before my face. Its lid peels back like a metallic flower and out wafts the smell of hot, wasted possibility. I watch, helpless.

Then something inside me—part conscience, part imagination—reaches for the impossible. I press my palms together, feel the pulse of the city’s living pavement climb up my arms, and release a breath that tastes like fertile soil after rain. The cyclone slows, the capsules soften, their aluminum skins remembering the bauxite mountains they once were. They stretch, bend, and blossom into seedlings made of silver threads. Roots sprout and tunnel downward; leaves unfurl, catching stray beams of dawn-twilight.

Around me, a forest rises—trees with trunks of braided light and foliage like solar panels. They hum electricity, siphoning dream-carbon from the air. The city’s neon vines twine up the new trunks and illuminate fractal patterns of sustainable design: refillable canisters, communal grinders, neighborhood cafés that loan reusable cups the way libraries loan books. I realize none of this future requires heroic sacrifice, only a shift from single-serve isolation to shared ritual.

I lift the last intact capsule from my pocket. It feels suddenly archaic, like a fossil from an era that prized speed over stewardship. I set it at the foot of a freshly grown tree; the pod melts into the soil, feeding bioluminescent mycelium. Overhead, the clouds part, revealing a sky that remembers stars.

Standing in that dream-forest city, I choose: when I wake, I will give up the throw-away pods. I’ll grind whole beans, savor the ritual, and compost the grounds. I will let convenience sharpen into mindfulness, let routine become respect. And though the waking world cannot sprout silver trees overnight, the decision plants one seed—real, imperfect, but alive.

In the distance, a dawn bell rings. The trees wave their sunlit leaves. I breathe a promise I intend to keep, and the dream dissolves into morning light.
