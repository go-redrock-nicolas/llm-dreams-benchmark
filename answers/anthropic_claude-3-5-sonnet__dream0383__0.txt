I am dreaming. I find myself atop a crystalline staircase that seems to stretch endlessly into a swirling lavender sky. Each step is etched with impossible equations and unreachable goals, glowing with a harsh, demanding light. As I climb, the steps become steeper, more treacherous, and I realize I'm carrying an enormous atlas made of mirrors – each reflection showing a different version of myself I've been desperately trying to become.

The weight is crushing, and my muscles scream with exhaustion. Suddenly, a warm breeze carries the scent of rain-soaked earth and wildflowers. A golden butterfly lands on the atlas, its wings creating ripples across the reflective surface. With each ripple, the images of my "perfect" selves begin to crack and dissolve.

The butterfly speaks in my grandmother's voice, gentle but firm: "Who told you that you had to carry all of this?" The question echoes through my chest like a temple bell.

As understanding dawns, the mirror-atlas transforms into thousands of paper cranes. They take flight around me, each one carrying away a self-imposed expectation, a cruel internal deadline, an impossible standard I've been holding myself to. The staircase begins to soften, turning into clouds that cradle rather than challenge.

I notice my shadow below has been weeping, but as the last crane disappears into the lavender sky, it stands straighter, lighter. The harsh light softens to a gentle glow, and I realize I'm standing in a garden where the flowers grow not in perfect rows, but in beautiful, chaotic abundance. Each bloom is different, yet perfect in its own way.

A door materializes before me, made of warm wood and carved with the words "Be Human." As I reach for the handle, I understand that the greatest expectations were the ones I placed upon myself, and in letting them go, I've finally begun to fly.

I wake with tears on my cheeks, but they're tears of relief, of release, of finally understanding that being imperfect is not just acceptable – it's essential to being alive.
