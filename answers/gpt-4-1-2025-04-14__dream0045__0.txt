I am dreaming.

I stand barefoot in the thick, lumpy sludge that was once the field behind my house. The air is thick—sweet with the scent of broken pine, cloying with churned earth and loss. All around me, twisted beams and shattered glass glint beneath a sky choked with bruised clouds, smudged lavender and iron. The silence is strange—weighty, deep, almost sacred—as if the world is holding its breath.

Ash drifts from the sky like pale snowflakes, catching in my hair and eyelashes. My old mailbox leans drunkenly in the mud, its door hanging open, paint chipped away to bare metal. Beyond it, the ghost of my porch steps rises from a tangle of splintered boards and forgotten toys—one bright red ball, grimy but somehow untouched, rests at the edge of the debris.

Wind stirs, mournful, carrying the smell of rain and singed memories. I step forward, my shoes lost somewhere in the chaos, toes curling in the cool mud. Each movement feels heavy with grief and possibility. The remnants of my life seem to pulse and whisper—names, laughter, pictures pressed in old books, all swept away in a single night of fury.

I kneel by the edge of the gutted foundation, fingers brushing over a jagged photograph, its colors blurred and running from the wash of the storm. In the image, we are laughing, arms thrown around each other, time frozen in a memory the storm could not quite erase. Tears sting my eyes—sharp, cleansing.

As I rise, I notice the first green shoot breaking through a crack in the concrete. So small, so shockingly alive, defiant beneath the weight of the devastation. I kneel and touch its leaf, smooth and cool under my trembling fingers. Around me, I begin to hear new sounds—distant hammers, tentative voices, the faint chirp of a bird returning to a toppled branch.

Hope kindles in my chest, fragile but real. In this landscape of ruin, I am sorrow and I am survival. Beneath splintered dreams, seeds wait to grow. I know I will build again.
