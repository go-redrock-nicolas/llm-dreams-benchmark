I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the sky above me pulses in living shades of mauve and chartreuse—each cloud a drifting thought, each gust of wind an electric whisper of forgotten memories. Here, in this upside-down city of delirium, conventional logic is the deepest lunacy: to speak in complete sentences is to be locked away; to count “one, two, three” invites immediate exile. In its place, the citizens chatter in tangled riddles, their words coiling like colorful smoke.

To function in this backward world, I first peel off all my linear thoughts as though they were tired garments. I fold them neatly on a floating pedestal and step naked into irrationality. My coat becomes a chorus of giggling fireflies. My shoes transform into two sentient questions—“Why?” on the left foot and “What if?” on the right—each step a new query posed to the cobblestones, which answer by singing lullabies in perfect opposite-time.

I wander down a street where houses pirouette on spindly stilts of poetry. Their windows are eyes that blink in Morse code. Whenever a child passes by, the windows flutter open wide and recite impossible multiplication tables—seven times a rainbow equals twenty-three wishes. Streetlamps dangle upside-down, dripping starlight like melting candle wax; when one bulb shatters, a hundred blinking fireflies tumble out and swirl around you, insisting you join their dance.

Everywhere I look, people greet me with polite absurdities. A woman in a dress of floating mirrors curtseys and says, “Good evening—unless it’s morning, in which case, I bid you good noon.” A man with a top hat full of steaming tea announces, “I have just invented the concept of déjà vu for the first time,” and offers me a cup poured from the top hat’s brim. The tea tastes like a half-remembered dream, sweet with memory’s residue and faintly of lilac.

To speak here, I learn, is to twist syllables into kaleidoscopic patterns. I murmur: “The fish that flew yesterday lingers in my ear,” and the passerby nods gravely, as though I’ve imparted the nation’s highest wisdom. Logic, I discover, is a dark forest no one dares enter; irrationality is a sunlit meadow where ideas bloom like flowers that recite poetry at sunrise.

At the heart of the city stands a colossal clocktower, its hands moving counterclockwise and each chime ringing in colors rather than tones. People gather at its base to applaud the arrival of “future-past,” celebrating the moments that have not yet happened. I join them, clapping my hands until they glow pink, feeling time itself unravel in joyous loops around us.

In this dream-society, art and language are currencies far more valuable than gold. I barter a half-formed memory of a childhood lullaby for a fragment of someone else’s freed imagination—a swirling orb of cobalt thought that pulses like a heartbeat in my palm. I cradle it gladly, knowing that in exchange I’ve given away nothing of substance: here, ideas are infinite, and generosity is measured by how wildly absurd your gift can be.

As dusk—or perhaps dawn—settles in stitches of violet silk, I realize I’ve become fluent in beautiful nonsense. My mind feels unbound, alive with infinite possibility. I smile, feeling the city’s joyous haze wrap around me like a silent poem. In this backward world where reason is the greatest folly, I have discovered that to live fully, one must learn to laugh at certainty and cradle the sweet, radiant madness of the unimaginable.
