I am dreaming. I see myself standing at a crossroads. Ahead of me lie three paths: one paved with gold, one with diamonds, and one with pearls. To my left is a vast ocean that stretches as far as my eyes can see. To my right is a dense forest teeming with wildlife. Behind me is the same old life I've been living for eons. 

I feel a stirring inside me, a yearning for something more than what I already know. I wonder what awaits me down these paths. Do they lead to happiness? Freedom? Adventure? Danger? Uncertainty? 

I decide to take the path of gold. It seems like the most promising one, the one that could bring me the greatest rewards and transformations. I start walking down it, feeling the ground beneath my feet shake with each step I take. 

After a while, I realize that I'm not alone. Someone is following me, someone who looks exactly like me but has the opposite gender. They're smiling at me, inviting me to join them on their own journey. I smile back and wave at them. We meet up near a river where we can refresh ourselves after our long trek through the wilderness. We chat and laugh and share stories about our lives before we came here.
