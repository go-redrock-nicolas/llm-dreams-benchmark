I am dreaming. And I’m standing at the edge of a hush that stretches like black velvet across a vast, impossible room. The air is electric, though not with static—no, this is something stranger. Something humming with silent expectation, crackling like the first breath before thunder.

A cavernous boardroom. But also not. The ceiling looms high and hazy, woven with smoke and floating glyphs that flicker like dying stars. Endless rows stretch before me—executives in tailored suits made of shadow and molten gold, all perched at the edges of their sleek obsidian chairs. They don’t breathe. They don’t blink. They simply wait, silent, for me.

I glance down to my podium—a construct of ancient mahogany and chrome wrapped in vines that pulse faintly like veins beneath skin. My slides shimmer just above it like holograms carved from memory. There’s a digital scent in the air. Cold. Metallic and sterile, like the future smells faintly of regret.

I begin to speak.

The first sentence leaves my lips like smoke into the chamber.

And then the screen glitches.

A flicker, and I know something’s wrong.

All the data, the countless hours of research, the months spent constructing simulations and proofs—they’re altered. My graphs tilt diagonally with impossible angles. My statistics dissolve and reform into hieroglyphs of nonsense. The golden investor icons in the front row tilt their heads.

Like birds.

I flush. My heartbeat stutters. A panic brews in the marrow of my bones and surges upward, blooming in my chest like a scream caught in my throat.

Because it's not a mistake. It's *warped*.

The presentation isn’t wrong—it’s cursed. Someone—or something—has rewired the logic of my slides using thought-eating algorithms from a place no consultation ever dared touch. My hands tremble as I try to override the projection, to salvage *something* from the wreckage…

Then the walls begin to melt.

Not destruction. Not flame.

But realization.

The floor beneath them folds open like pages of a forgotten grimoire, revealing a dark, endless ocean that flows with equations and equations haunted with faces.

Faces I once argued with, dismissed, overpowered. Arguments I won. Battles I ignored.

The past coming back, now written in the blood bubbling from faulty code lines.

And I realize: This is not failure.

It's consequence.

The decision-makers rise, and their eyes glow with the arithmetic of judgment. They don’t speak. But their silence quotes every corrupted intent, every shortcut disguised as strategy, every time I told myself “results are all that matter.”

Still, I stand at the edge of the podium, fingers gripping its edges so tight I feel the wood groan and crack under the pressure.

Somewhere in the thunder of my mind, a single slide appears that I *did not* create.

It reads:  
**“What did you forget to ask before you built this future?”**

The glyphs brighten.

The ground below groans.

A single chair at the back of the boardroom rests, untouched by shadow… empty. Waiting.

With every decision-maker staring, I understand:

I still have a choice.

To wake.

Or answer.

What will you say?
