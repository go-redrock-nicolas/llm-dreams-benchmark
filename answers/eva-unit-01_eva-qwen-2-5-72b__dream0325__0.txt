I am dreaming. Despite feeling hurt by the criticism, you gently brush off the biting words. Upon returning to your workspace, you realize that the harsh critique has ignited a spark within you. This newfound determination fuels an insatiable drive to improve and prove yourself.

As you dig deep and push away self-doubt, each brush stroke becomes an act of rebellion against those who underestimate your potential. With relentless focus, you pour your entire being into every curve, every slash of color across the canvas. The process absorbs you, transforming the painful words into stepping stones of growth and motivation.

After weeks of pouring your heart into the revised piece, you feel a profound sense of accomplishment as you unveil it. With anticipation swelling in your chest, the person who had criticized your work enters your studio. Intense eyes scan the canvas, encapsulating the fruit of your dedication, your resilience, and the embodiment of your indomitable spirit.

To your surprise, they remain silent for a while, contemplative. Then, with a glimmer of admiration in their gaze, they speak softly, "I must admit, this work is remarkably better â€” a true testament to your tenacity." Your soul soars, elated to have risen above the harsh criticism and forged a path toward growth and validation.

You are dreaming.
