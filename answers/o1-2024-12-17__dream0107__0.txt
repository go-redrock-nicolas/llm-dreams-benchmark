I am dreaming. …prepare to deliver your verdict. The chamber itself feels alive with swirling energy—like a boundless hall carved from gemstone. Hazy shafts of starlight pierce the tall arches overhead. Massive, gently pulsating columns line the perimeter, each seemingly carved from living marble. Their smooth surfaces dance with shimmering veins of color that hum in unison with your heartbeat.

You sit atop a throne of obsidian that curves around your body like a serpent, its scales occasionally glinting in time to distant thunder. Before you stand two towering beings, so powerful that their presence alone warps the air around them. One is cloaked in blazing red light, their steps liquefying the floor in molten rivulets. The other is drenched in a thick, swirling darkness, occasionally flickering with dazzling bursts of lightning. Both of them exude spiraling auras that command respect and trepidation.

The dispute at hand is unlike any ordinary court case. They argue not about land or wealth, but about the balance of elemental forces that shape entire worlds. One entity demands the unleashing of a long-dormant cataclysmic flame, claiming it will burn away the rot and pave the way for new beginnings. The other insists that darkness must fold over existence, forcing an age of pure introspection and forging resilience in all living things. Each believes only their approach will preserve the essence of all that ever was and all that will be.

Echoes crash through the endlessly tall hall as each delivers their final declarations. Thunder booms in the distance, followed by swirling gales that whip the shimmering draperies overhead. In the luminescent gloom, their voices intertwine, forming a chorus of sharp intensity and monumental authority. The temperature spikes, then plummets. Diamonds of frosty mist condense on the chamber floor, only to be burned away by bursts of invisible flame.

You’re the only figure in the room whose presence remains unchallenged. An ethereal gavel flickers in front of you like a spectral key—yet you can almost sense it morphing into a scale balanced precariously between two cosmic weights. The tension is thick. You can feel the awe of lesser beings—tiny silhouettes along the edges of the hall, anxious watchers whose futures hang on every syllable. A hush falls across this gathering, as if all the stars have aligned to bear witness.

Your breath feels both unbearably heavy and light as a feather. You close your eyes for the briefest moment, inhaling the scent—equal parts ozone and scorched earth—and summoning every fragment of wisdom you’ve ever gleaned. The shimmering columns grow still, the swirling darkness subsides into a restless hush, and the radiant fire draws inward, tightening like a compressed galaxy of surging molten light.

Then, you rise from your throne, feeling the obsidian scales ripple beneath you. In this dreamscape, your voice resonates like distant chimes woven into rolling thunder. The fate of countless beings, realms, and timelines rests upon your decree. The hush turns brittle. Dust motes sparkling in the beams of starlight seem to freeze in midair. 

Your words begin forming before you even understand them yourself, as though your spirit has tapped into a universal consciousness. In that crystalline moment, as you prepare to cast down your ruling, you sense the energies of all creation swirling around you, supporting your decision. A hush so profound settles that even your pulse seems to echo in the chamber. Then, in absolute clarity, you open your mouth to speak—knowing that, upon this verdict, nations will rise or crumble, and the stars themselves might realign.

But just as the first word of your judgment leaves your lips, the dream shudders and dissolves into a scatter of prismatic shards. You awaken with the faint imprint of your decisive words ghosting across your mind—words that held unimaginable power, words that could alter the destinies of gods. Yet, like the fading trails of asteroids in a nocturnal sky, they slip away from your waking consciousness, leaving you breathless and forever wondering about that ultimate pronouncement you nearly brought into being.
