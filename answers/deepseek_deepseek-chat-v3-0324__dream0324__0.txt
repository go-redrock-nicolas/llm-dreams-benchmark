I am dreaming. * * *  

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and something metallic—like old coins left under the tongue. I am standing in a forest, but the trees are not trees. They are spines, vertebrae stacked high into a black sky, their branches stretching like skeletal fingers, clicking against one another in a wind I cannot feel. The ground beneath me is soft, pulsing. When I look down, I realize I am standing on a vast, breathing lung, its surface glistening with a fine mist of blood.  

A voice whispers from nowhere and everywhere: *"You forgot something."*  

I turn, and there—perched on a ribcage arching from the soil—sits a child made of wax. Their face is smooth, featureless, melting slightly at the edges. They hold out a hand, and in their palm rests my own still-beating heart, slick and trembling.  

*"You left this behind,"* the child says. Their voice is the sound of ice cracking underfoot.  

I reach for it, but the moment my fingers brush the muscle, the dream twists—  

Now I am in a house I have never seen but know intimately. The walls are lined with mirrors, but the reflections are wrong. In one, I am a child. In another, I am ancient, my skin paper-thin, my eyes hollow. The third mirror shows only a door, slightly ajar.  

A low hum fills the air, vibrating in my teeth. The door creaks.  

Something is coming.  

I wake with a gasp, my sheets damp, my chest aching as if my heart had truly been held in another’s hand. The room is dark, but the dream clings—not just to my skin, but to the air itself, like the afterimage of a struck match.  

All day, I feel it. The wax child’s voice lingers in the rustle of leaves outside my window. The mirrors wait at the edges of my vision. And beneath every breath, the unshakable certainty:  

*I did forget something.*  

But what?
