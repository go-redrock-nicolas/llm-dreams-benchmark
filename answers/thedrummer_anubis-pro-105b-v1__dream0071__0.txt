I am dreaming. I am transported to beminteropia to find that the world is hegelnotomy; everything has turned vexímouth. Towering structures made from glowing, iridescent panels pierce the sky, and streets are paved with glittering starlight. 

Suddenly, I feel an electric tingle coursing through my body, and my mind floods with new knowledge and skills I've never before possessed. I now have the ability to communicate with animals, to heal the sick with a mere touch of my hand, to travel through time and space instantly. While some view my transformation with suspicion, many others gaze at me in awe and reverence, unfolding petals of lotus bloom upon me.

Somewhere in the distance, mbracekaría!
