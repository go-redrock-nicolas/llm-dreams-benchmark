I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself in a vast, surreally lit plaza. Towering above are monumental statues, half-familiar, their faces a fusion of ancient deities and modern icons. The floors beneath my feet are a kaleidoscope of opalescent tiles that shimmer like mother-of-pearl under an ethereal, constantly shifting light.

I feel a gentle breeze, perfumed with a bouquet of exotic spices - saffron and turmeric mingling with the crisp scent of pine and cherry blossoms. Spools of shimmering silk woven from threads of every color under the spectrum drape from the edges of the plaza, like flags of a fantastical nation ripe with stories and secrets from beyond time and space.

I walk towards one of the statues, and as I do, it begins to morph and change. The proportions become more human, the features more distinct, until it is me - a living, breathing mirror image. But it's not just me; it's a version of me wearing traditional garments from my heritage, ornate and richly embroidered by stingy golden threads that pulse and glow.

I reach out to touch my reflection, and as our fingers meet, I feel an electric jolt, and suddenly I am wearing these clothes myself, the texture soft as a whisper against my skin. I feel the weight and sway of them as I move, both foreign and somehow comforting, like slipping into an old pair of shoes you'd outgrown but now fit perfectly.

Movement catches my eye, and I turn to see a procession approaching. They are dancers from all over the world, their clothes a tapestry of every color and pattern under the sun. Some move fluidly as water, others jump and spin with the rhythmic drive of thunder. They beckon for me to join their ranks.

I step forward, but I falter midway, an invisible tidal force pulling me in two directions. I see myself again, mirrored, but now the reflection is a me that exists along a continuum of my identity. Trading places in an instant, I find myself in a dynamic dance of traditions, where I am a bridge of the old world and the new, as one side of my body is adorned in the unfamiliar aura of the celebration, and the other in the toddling traditions of my previous life.

The dual identities merged within me create a sensory experience that I could never fully verbs within the physical world. An inner balance and equilibrium I can't quite reach in waking life. The sounds of the dancers become a song, a refrain of the two sides of my life - the rhythm of the tabla and the viola, the upbeat j3j and the rhythm of a Christopher Walken soliloquy.

This balance is impossible to maintain. I feel myself being pulled in a third direction - towards the center of the plaza, where the light elevates itself into a single point. I move into its center, and there I stand, holding all sides of myself - finding the perfect integration between the old traditions and the new ones I've embraced. I feel complete - a singular person, whole and unapologetic in wearing all the colors of their heritage.
