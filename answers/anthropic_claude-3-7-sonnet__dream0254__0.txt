I am dreaming. I discover my close friend has been harboring a devastating secret that affects us both. As they finally break down in front of me, the world around us shifts subtly—the coffee shop where we sit seems to breathe, the ambient noise fading to a distant hum. Their face, always composed and bright, now crumples like tissue paper in rain.

Tears streak down their cheeks, catching the afternoon light streaming through windows that suddenly seem too transparent. They confess they've been diagnosed with a rare condition that causes memories to fade, but not randomly—it specifically targets memories of meaningful connections first. They've been forgetting me, piece by piece, for months.

The coffee between us grows cold as they explain how they've been keeping journals, recording our history, desperately trying to hold onto the fabric of our friendship while feeling it slip through their fingers like fine sand. They show me their phone—hundreds of photos of us labeled with detailed notes: "This is when we laughed so hard we couldn't breathe at the pier," and "This is your favorite song—remember how we danced?"

I realize now why they sometimes looked at me with momentary confusion, why they occasionally asked questions about things we'd done countless times before. The dream-light shifts, casting everything in a golden-blue haze as I reach across the table, my hand seeming to move in slow motion, to grasp theirs.

The revelation doesn't bring anger but an overwhelming surge of determination. In this moment, as dream-logic makes perfect sense, I know I will become the keeper of our memories until science finds a way to help them. I will be their external hard drive, their living memoir, reflecting their own stories back to them day after day after day.
