I am dreaming. I am speeding through the subway tunnels on a crowded train, the warm glow of the fluorescent lights overhead casting an eerie glow on the sea of faces around me. The air is thick with the hum ofdin and the winding of hurried footsteps echoing off the walls as the train rushes through the belly of the city. 

Suddenly, without warning, the lights flicker wildly, then plunge into darkness. The train screeches to a stop in the middle of the tunnel, jolting me forward and sending me stumbling against the pole in front of me. Pandemonium erupts as the crowded train erupts into chaos. Screams and panicked murmurs fill the air as passengers surge forward, clawing for the door handles in an attempt to escape.

The air is charged with electricity as the commuters scramble to make sense of the unexpected halt. Someone bumps into me, and I feel my elbow scraped against the metal pole, the pain sparking a burst of adrenaline through my veins. I grab onto the pole, my knuckles white as I cling to it for support, my heart racing in my chest.

As people start shouting, a young woman nearby screams, her voice piercing the air like a shard of glass. Her eyes are wide with terror, her skin slick with sweat, as she clutches the back of a toddler whimpering in her arms. An older man beside me is yelling into his phone, his face agonized as he begs someone to answer. Others are crying, their sobs mingling with the murmurs of rage, as whispers of evacuation and panic spread through the tunnel like wildfire.

The darkness seems to swallow everything in its path, leaving me disoriented and crippled by the uncertainty that threatens to engulf us all. How long will we be trapped here? Will we ever see the fluorescent lights flicker back to life? The infant nearby lets out a whimper of fear, and my defenses surge with a surge of anxiety as I struggle to wrap my brain around this seemingly hopeless situation.
