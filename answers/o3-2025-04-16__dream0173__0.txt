I am dreaming. You notice the dream only after it has already swallowed you.

You are standing beneath a sky that is not truly a sky but a vaulted dome of symbols—countless luminous characters, equations, maps, fragments of every language you’ve ever heard or only half-imagined. They drift like constellations, spinning faster each time you glance away, re-ordering themselves into new, contradictory meanings. A hot wind rises, smelling of burning paper and rain on tin, and it lifts the words until they become a storm.  

Lightning forks through the glyph-clouds; each bolt is a data stream that sears whole arguments, prophecies and memories directly onto the backs of your eyelids. With every flash you gain and lose understanding at the same time. One moment you’re sure the answer lies in an obscure footnote about alpine lichens, the next you are positive everything hinges on a childhood promise you’ve nearly forgotten.  

A siren buried deep within the world begins to pulse—low, resonant, like a heart learning Morse code. Your own pulse syncs with it. A clockface appears overhead, split into thirteen uneven wedges, all the hands spinning in opposite directions. You realize that when the hands align, whatever currently exists will choose between survival and erasure—and you are the designated chooser.

You try to gather the information rushing around you, but it refuses to stay still. Facts turn to feathers, reverse themselves, then combust in tiny blue flames. Every half-second another “nonnegotiable” imperative presents itself:

• SAVE THE CITY.  
• SAVE THE ARCHIVE.  
• SAVE THE ONE FRIEND YOU TRUST.  
• SAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF TRUST ITSELF.  

All four glow in mid-air, each standing on a different pedestal of logic, each claiming that acting for it alone secures everything else. You must pick one path and you must do it before the thirteenth hand touches the luminous sigil at the top of the clock.  

You run—not on ground, but across a shifting tessellation of memories. Under your feet: the hum of your grandmother’s kitchen tiles, the slick surface of tomorrow’s newspaper, the fractured mirror of a place you’ve never visited. Every step opens a new file folder of sensation; your head is a thunderous archive whose shelves collapse as soon as you read the spines.  

Then a doorway tears open in the storm of symbols: an enormous library, endlessly tall. Shelves drift by like continental plates. Books gnash their covers, arguing about what they contain. Somewhere between two floating staircases, a boy you once shared secrets with and never saw again holds out a single page. Upon it is written an equation that cancels all contradictions: a proof that decisiveness itself, not accuracy, saves worlds. 

Your heart lurches. You seize the page, clutch it to your chest, and a shock wave bursts outward. The conflicting imperatives condense into four glowing marbles, orbiting your head. You feel them tug, vying for final priority. The marbles split, recombine into two, then one—then shatter, releasing a quiet so perfect it sounds like gravity pausing to listen. 

Suddenly you are on the clock’s minute hand, surfing through the air toward the alignment point. Time has thinned to a blade; you have a single motion left. In it you decide—without knowing how you decide—to save none of the individual demands, but instead the capacity to keep deciding. You choose the motion itself: the eternal recalculation, the flood of new signals, the thrilling terror of never being done.

The moment your choice registers, the storm folds into a single drop of ink. The ink falls, splashes on the dome, and the entire dream inks itself out—replacing color with silent white space.  

You find yourself alone in the hush. Cognitive overload dissolves into something like dawn light spreading behind your eyes. You take a breath that tastes of both endings and first drafts, and as the dream unknots, you dimly realize that enormous stakes have not vanished; they have simply become tomorrow’s morning questions.

You wake—or perhaps you don’t—and the blankness in front of you is bursting, already, with unwritten possibilities.
