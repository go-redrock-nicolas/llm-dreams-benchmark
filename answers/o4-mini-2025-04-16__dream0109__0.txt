I am dreaming. You awaken in this new realm to find yourself suspended not on solid ground, but in a gentle repulsion from it—your feet hover inches above a smooth, liquid-glass floor that arcs upward like a colossal bowl. All around you, structures grow organically from thought: spindles of light twist into cathedraltall towers, then unfurl into blossom-shaped plazas, each petal humming with past and future memories. Here, gravity pushes outward, time trickles backward, and sight has surrendered its monopoly—sound paints vivid filaments of color, taste carves intricate patterns in the air, and the faintest vibrations on your skin compose an ever-shifting symphony of texture.

To integrate into this paradoxical society, you must learn to unhear as much as you hear. You begin by closing your eyes and tuning yourself to the reverse-rhythm heartbeat of the city. With every backward pulse, you feel your own temporal flow invert: thoughts of tomorrow drift in from the distance, while memories reclaim the present. You stretch out a hand and, instead of encountering solid space, find a gentle vacuum—ideas themselves meeting your fingertips. You think of friendship, and two beings of prismatic smoke coil around your wrist in greeting; you think of curiosity, and the ground beneath you responds by blooming luminous glyphs that spell out questions in an ever-evolving script.

You discover their language is not spoken but sculpted—each utterance a swirl of shifting light and scent. To communicate, you must inhale a gentle violet haze and exhale fractals of your own emotions. The first time you try, your breath blossoms into a soft tapestry of nostalgia, and the nearest inhabitant tilts its crystalline head in recognition. With practice, you learn to weave complex ideas: gratitude as a cascade of mint-green ripples, wonder as a chorus of silvery bells that sing through the soles of your feet.

Next, you must master the inverse architecture of memory: here, you store your experiences outside your mind, embedding them into the cityscape itself. You step into a hollow column of polished obsidian and project your earliest childhood laughter onto its walls; the building quivers in delight and grows a new wing—one that echoes your joy in a thousand mirrored corridors. In return, the city gifts you a shard of inverted chronology: a small, obsidian mirror that shows your future self moving seamlessly through these backward-flowing days.

Finally, to seal your passage into full membership, you are asked to perform the Ritual of Unlearning. Under a sky that yawns open to reveal swirling constellations dressed in negative light, you let go of every rule you’ve ever known: gravity’s pull, linear stories, even the solidity of “you.” As each old certainty dissolves, the world around you brightens. Gravity ceases to repel or attract—it dances. Time neither retreats nor advances—it sings. And you, released from every anchor of “normal,” find that you, too, have become elemental: a being equally at home in forward-marching clocks or backward-spinning stars, capable of crafting reality with the lightest of thoughts.

In this dream-civilization of opposites, you are no longer a visitor but a living paradox—a bridge between what was and what could be, weaving your own story into the ever-receding tapestry of time.
