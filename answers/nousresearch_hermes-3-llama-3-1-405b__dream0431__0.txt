I am dreaming. I find myself standing on a cliff’s edge, overlooking rolling hills, vibrant meadows, a glassy lake, my eyes drinking in the beauty all around me. I start to descend.

As I wander through the fields, I chance upon animals, creatures of all shapes and sizes, living harmoniously, the tall grass whispering tales of their escapades. A roaring river comes into sight, its sound - a language I feel I can comprehend. I decide to follow the river.

The sun begins to set, and I spot a village nearby. It's made of wood and stone, with fires outlining its streets. I see villagers bustling about, dancing around fires, telling stories, sharing joy, cooking meals.

As I walk in, I am greeted by a familiar face. It's someone from my past, someone who caused me deep-seated pain, pain that I still hold onto. In this dream though, I see her differently. She isn’t the villain I had painted, but a person with her own struggles, pain, history, and regret.

I walk towards her, apprehensive, yet resolute. As we sit down near a fire, I listen to her speak of her regrets, her desire to go back in time and undo the hurt. The reflection of the fire dances in her eyes, painting a picture of sorrow, and sincerity. 

In the deepest parts of my imagination, I hold power - the power to forgive, to free, to heal. As the words, "I forgive you", leave my lips, a weight lifts. A tangible, heavy entity disappears from my shoulders, vanishing into the night’s sky, leaving behind a feeling of lightness, and relief.

An elder from the village walks forward and, taking our hands, leads us to the river. “Wash away the remnants of the past, let the water cleanse your heart, welcome forgiveness, and embrace the future.” We dip our hands, feeling the cool water washing away the residues of pain.

The pain I clung to, nurtured, fostered, and the pain she carried, are swept away by the roaring river, leaving us with a clean slate, a new chapter to write. I feel hope surge within me. The villagers erupt in cheer around us, a celebration of this newfound peace. Music fills the air, and we dance around the fires, sharing a renewed bond.

The night whirls by in laughter, dance, and joy. The village elder returns, placing a charm around my neck, telling me it embodies the healing power of forgiveness. 

I wake up, not with the dream slipping away, but with it deeply etched in my conscious. I touch my chest and feel the charm, a reminder of the healing, the liberation that awaits. It is time to carry the strength of my dream into reality, to forgive, to heal, and to live anew.
