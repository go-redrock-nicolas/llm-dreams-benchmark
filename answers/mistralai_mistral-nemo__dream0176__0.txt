I am dreaming. I grip the steering wheel tightly, knuckles turning pallid under the moonlight seeping through the windshield. My heart hammers in my chest like a blacksmith's hammer on an anvil, as I realize with a gut-wrenching jolt that our brakes have vanished. The car, now a rogue beast, is hurtling down the slick, serpentine road, the engine's growl a panicked primal howl.

The tarmac unfurls before us, an endless ribbon of black punctuated by the red taillights of vehicles ahead, each one an obstacle dotting our path to impending doom. The world outside is a symphony of chaos: trees zooming into blurs, streetlights casting eerie, long shadows that dance around us like spirits of the night. The rain, once a delicate drizzle, now hammers onto the rooftop, drumming a crescendo that drowns out my racing thoughts.

My eyes dart between the road and the control panel, desperate for any sign of hope. The speedometer needle swings to the right, harder, faster; we're barreling through the night, a bullet aimed at the heart of the valley below. The dashboard is a canvas of red warnings, the 'check engine' light flickering like an accusing finger.

Every nerve in my body is alight, each fibre vibrating with fear and adrenaline. My mouth is dry, my hands slick with sweat. I grapple with the steering wheel, trying to control the spin as we hurtle towards intersections, through crossroads, all sensible thought charred away by fear. The road rushes towards us, the visibility narrowing to a narrow slit as the speed picks up, the wind roaring in my ears.

Suddenly, a bridge looms ahead, the cold moonlight glinting off the steel guardrails. It's our last chance, a sliver of hope amidst the chaos. I make my decision, gripping the wheel with renewed determination. We're not going down without a fight. We're not going down at all. We're going to make it. We have to. As we career onto the bridge, I can't help but let out a desperate cry into the wind, a defiant roar that echoes through the canyon below. The chase is on.
