I am dreaming. I find myself walking down a winding path through morning mist, following hand-painted wooden signs to "The Reflection Retreat." The gravel crunches beneath my feet as I approach a rustic lodge nestled between ancient pines. Something pulls me forward—a strange certainty that I belong here, though I don't recall registering.

Inside, a circle of empty chairs waits in a sun-dappled room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a still lake. One by one, others drift in—twelve strangers with kind but weary eyes. We settle into the circle as a facilitator with silver-streaked hair and gentle hands welcomes us.

"This retreat chooses its participants," she explains mysteriously. "You're all here because you share something profound."

When people begin sharing their stories, my breath catches. A woman with constellation freckles describes the same crushing self-doubt that visits me at 3 AM. A man with gardener's hands articulates the exact feeling of inadequacy that haunts my career decisions. A teenager with vibrant blue hair speaks about the specific fear of connection that has kept me isolated for years.

My skin prickles with goosebumps. These strangers are voicing thoughts I've never told anyone—private wounds I believed were uniquely mine. I feel simultaneously exposed and embraced, as if someone has peered into my soul but instead of judgment offers understanding.

When my turn comes, words flow that I didn't know I had, releasing burdens I didn't realize I carried. Tears stream down my face, matched by others in the circle. The boundaries between us seem to dissolve—we are separate waves of the same ocean of human experience.

As sunset bathes the room in amber light, I realize something profound: my deepest pain was never my isolation but my belief that I was alone in it.
