I am dreaming. I drift through a pale orchard whose moonlit branches arc overhead like shimmering ribs. The ground beneath my feet pulses in soft waves of violet light, each step sending ripples across the black glass soil. In the distance, a labyrinth of twisted silver hedges rises and falls like the backbone of some ancient beast—its walls are etched with a fractal pattern that seems to breathe and shift whenever I blink. A hush settles, broken only by the faint tolling of a clock whose hands melt like candlewax whenever I try to read the hour.

Beyond the maze’s entrance, I find a pool of liquid mirror. When I lean in, the face that stares back is at once my own and a stranger’s—eyes bright with longing, mouth curved in a knowing, sorrowful smile. Overhead, a lone raven wheels in slow circles, its wings casting fluttering shadows that scatter the fractal reflections on the hedges. Every time I approach the bird, the hedges rearrange themselves, guiding me deeper into the maze, as if urging me to follow a path I can’t yet see.

At the center stands a weathered door, ironbound and humming with distant voices. My hand trembles on the cold latch. Beyond it, I sense corridors of memory: childhood whispers, first loves, unspoken regrets—and the pulse of something formidable, waiting to be claimed.

What these images might whisper about my inner world:

• The Silver Labyrinth Fractals  
  – Suggests an unconscious drive to map out my complex thoughts and feelings—layer upon layer of pattern and possibility, each turn a choice between safety and exploration.

• The Liquid Mirror Pool  
  – Reflects a fragmented selfimage, as if part of me remains hidden or unfamiliar. The mingling of my face with a stranger’s hints at qualities I’ve yet to recognize or integrate.

• The Raven in Flight  
  – An ancient messenger of transformation, inviting me to watch my shadow and light dance together. Its circling wings imply a cycle: endings that seed new beginnings.

• The Melting Clock  
  – Speaks to my elastic sense of time—moments of stillness that stretch into eternity, and swift hours that vanish the instant I try to grasp them. Perhaps a fear of change, or an urge to live more vividly in each passing second.

• The IronBound Door  
  – Stands for thresholds I hesitate to cross—inviting me toward memories or potentials I keep locked away. My trembling hand betrays both anticipation and fear of what lies beyond.

In the waking light, these symbols invite gentle inquiry: What corners of memory am I reluctant to explore? Where does my selfimage fracture, and how might I weave those pieces into a more complete sense of who I am? The raven’s circling silhouette reminds me that endings and beginnings are entwined; even the melting clock urges me to savor each moment, neither rushing nor clinging. And that door—still closed in the dream—beckons me to unlock passages within: to journal, to meditate, to speak truths I’ve long kept silent. In honoring these images, I begin to trace a map of my deeper psyche, step by step, fractal by fractal.
