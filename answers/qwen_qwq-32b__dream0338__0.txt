I am dreaming. I’m standing at a crossroads, but it's not like any crossroads I’ve ever seen. The ground is made of liquid moonlight, shimmering and fluid, yet somehow solid enough to walk on. To my left, a path winds into a forest of towering glass trees, their surfaces etched with constellations that shift and rearrange themselves like living star charts. To my right, another path leads to a vast ocean under a crimson sunset, the water glowing with bioluminescent creatures that swirl in patterns resembling ancient runes.

A voice, neither male nor female, speaks directly in my mind: "Choose wisely. Each path is infinite, yet fleeting. The forest remembers all that was, the sea all that could be."

My heart races as I try to decide. The glass forest calls to me with its crystalline songs, promising revelations of forgotten truths. The crimson sea hums a siren song of possibilities, each wave a different life unlived. I reach out a hand towards the forest, then hesitate—the sea’s light flickers urgently, as if begging me to consider what might still come to pass.
