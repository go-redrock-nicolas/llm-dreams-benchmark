I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

At first, your gaze is pinned to the ground—a mosaic of iridescent petals, each one pulsing faintly like the gills of some deep-sea creature. They whisper as you step closer, their voices a chorus of half-remembered lullabies and static. You kneel, mesmerized, as the petals curl upward to brush your fingertips, leaving trails of warmth that linger like phantom sunlight. But when you lift your eyes, the horizon shudders. The sky is not a sky but a ceiling of liquid mercury, rippling with reflections of places you’ve never been yet somehow recognize: a library with no books, a desert of floating clocks, a bridge made of breath.  

You realize you’ve been breathing in sync with the petals. Each inhale floods your lungs with the scent of burnt honey and ozone, sharpening your focus until the world narrows to a single point—a crimson thread snaking through the flowers. You follow it, but the thread splits, then splinters into a thousand gossamer strands, each glowing with a different color, each humming a different emotion: emerald for grief, sapphire for a love you haven’t lived yet, gold for a memory you buried in a life you’ve forgotten.  

When you finally tear your eyes from the threads, the landscape erupts. The mercury sky cracks open, spilling constellations that crash to the earth like shattering glass. From the shards rise figures—tall, faceless, cloaked in shadows that move independently, as though the darkness itself is alive and curious. They don’t speak, but their presence hums in your bones, a question without words: *Why do you cling to the small, bright things when the vastness is yours?*  

You turn, and now the ground is a living tapestry of bioluminescent vines, weaving and unraveling to reveal doorways. One opens to a room where time pools like water, children laughing as they skip stones that ripple into different eras. Another reveals a forest of frozen screams, icicles dangling from branches like teeth. A third exhales a scent so achingly familiar—your mother’s perfume, your first heartbreak, the exact shade of twilight on a day that changed everything—that you stumble, overwhelmed.  

But the dream shifts again. The vines retract, and beneath them lies a river of liquid starlight, coursing not through the land but *through you*, veins of silver connecting every atom of your being to the thrumming heart of this impossible world. You see it now: the petals, the threads, the shattered constellations—all fragments of a larger truth, a symphony played on the strings of your own attention. The more you let go of what you *think* you should see, the more the dream unfurls. Mountains rise as sentient storms, their peaks dissolving into flocks of ink-black birds that scribble prophecies in the air. Oceans fold into origami creatures that walk on land, their scales glinting with the weight of unspoken regrets.  

And then—a mirror. Not glass, but a pool of quicksilver that reflects not your face, but your *essence*: a swirling nebula of light and shadow, a paradox of infinite selves. You reach out, and the surface ripples, revealing a thousand versions of your life—some lived, some abandoned, some waiting in the wings of possibility. One hand dips into the pool, and suddenly you’re *everywhere at once*, feeling the joy of a child’s first step, the agony of a goodbye that never came, the quiet thrill of a choice not yet made.  

The dream whispers, not in words but in the resonance of every atom in your body: *You are the lens. You are the loom. You are both the petal and the vastness that blooms beyond it.*  

And then—  
You wake, gasping, the taste of stardust and honey on your tongue, the ache of a thousand lives fading into the marrow of your bones.
