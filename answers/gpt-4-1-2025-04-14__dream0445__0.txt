I am dreaming.

I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, moonlit lake. The silver water reflects not only the night sky, but also swirling images from my life: faces of friends, echoes of laughter, moments when kind words were offered. Each compliment I’ve received drifts just above the surface, radiant and tender, forming lilies of pale gold and blush.

Yet whenever I reach out to touch one—a memory of someone saying, “You did well,” or “You are enough”—it trembles and, with a gentle splash, slips into the lake, vanishing under the rippling glass. I watch as the water grows dark and opaque where the compliment disappeared, as if I cannot hold it; my fingers pass through, unable to grasp the warmth or light.

Then, from the depths, I see something rise: sharp-edged, prickly blossoms of icy blue and indigo—my criticisms. Words I have spoken to myself, cold and heavy as stones: “Not good enough,” “Could have done better,” “They must mean someone else.” These do not hesitate near the surface. Instead, they cling to my skin like burrs, wrapping around my wrists and ankles, tightening until I can feel their chill seep into my bones. They whisper, their voices familiar—voices I have always listened to.

I begin to walk along the lakeshore, the landscape shifting with every step into a winding forest. The trees here whisper, too, their leaves etched with phrases both kind and cutting, forming a canopy of contrasting voices. The air is perfumed with possibility. I realize: the path before me is split in two. One way is illuminated by a gentle golden light—the gentle things people have said, the invitations to believe in my worth. The other way is cast in cold indigo, crowded with looping echoes of criticism, comfortable in its familiarity but cold.

In the dream, I pause. I see that the golden path shimmers hesitantly, as if waiting for me to give it permission to grow. I kneel beside it and touch a glowing word: “You are gentle,” it says. For the first time, I try to let this warmth seep in. The way is unfamiliar, but the warmth tingles and spreads—soft but insistent—as if healing something ancient within me.

As I walk deeper into the golden light, the criticisms begin to lose their grip. The words don’t disappear, but they become quieter, background murmurs rather than marching orders. Compliments I have deflected for so long now unfurl before me in blues and greens and pinks, bright and real as blooming wildflowers.

The trees bloom with phrases I had never allowed myself to believe. Their light reflects on the lake, showing me my face: uncertain, but soft and open. For the first time in the dream, I see myself, not through the cold lens of criticism, but through gilded strands of kindness and truth, weaving a tapestry of acceptance.

In this vivid realm—the deepest parts of my dreaming mind—I sense that balance is possible. And, upon waking, a single petal of gold remains on my palm: a memory of self-kindness, ready to be planted in waking life.
