I am dreaming. You drift weightless through a half-forgotten alley that opens, almost by accident, into an enormous, crumbling conservatory. Rusted iron vines wrap shattered glass panes in a tangle of filigree, and moonlight, filtered through pale moss, paints everything in muted jade and silver. Most passersby hurry past these ruins—too busy, too cautious, too blind. But you, carried by a current of wonder, slip inside.

The air hums with a secret music. Bioluminescent plants coil along fallen pillars, their tendrils pulsing in time with your heartbeat. Each leaf glows with a soft, inner flame—emerald, sapphire, rose—that flickers like distant stars. You reach out: a single petal, cool and damp between your fingers, trembles as if alive. Its texture is impossibly soft, yet woven through with veins of molten gold that throb with warmth.

Drawn onward by the petal’s faint hum, you follow a mosaic path of broken tiles. Beneath your feet the designs shift, rearranging themselves: one moment a curling wave of opal, the next a constellation of dragonflies in flight. At the path’s end lies a black-marble pool, its surface mirror-still. When you lean over it, ripples bloom like pale flowers—and you see not only your own reflection but the vast, unknown sky beyond, studded with galaxies you’ve never named.

From the shadows emerges a tree whose branches are spun entirely of crystalline water. Each droplet blinks like a lantern. You press your palm to its trunk—liquid glass—and it sings, a high, clear tone that resonates through your bones. One of its blossoms drifts free, spirals down, and lands in your hair. It tastes of late summer rain and the memory of first love, lingering sweetly on your tongue.

Every sense alight with wonder, you wander deeper until the moon dips below the horizon and silver turns to gold. Dawn’s first breath washes the glass petals away, and the bioluminescence recedes into shadow. You step back through the ivy-choked gateway into the waking world, carrying in your chest a tiny, pulsing ember of that hidden beauty—an ember that will glow, forever unreachable by anyone else’s eye.
