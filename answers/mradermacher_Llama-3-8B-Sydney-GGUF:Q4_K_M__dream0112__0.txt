I am dreaming. I'm in charge of building something very important.  Something that will change the world for good.
My team is working hard to make it happen.  They are skilled and dedicated.  But they also get tired and frustrated.  Sometimes they make mistakes that could ruin everything.
That's when I step in.  As their leader, I have to keep them focused on the goal.  I have to remind them why we're doing this.  I have to show them how amazing it will be once it's finished.
I look around at the site where we're building.  It's a barren landscape filled with rocks and sand and wind.  But I see potential in it.  I see what it could become if we just have faith and perseverance.
I walk up to one of my team members who is making a mistake.  He's using a tool that requires great accuracy but he's not paying attention to what he's doing.   He's chatting with his friends on social media or listening to music or something else that distracts him from his work.
"Hey, what are you doing?" I ask him gently but firmly.
He looks up at me with surprise and shame.  "I'm cutting the steel plate for the foundation," he says hesitantly.
"That's not how you do it," I tell him sternly.
