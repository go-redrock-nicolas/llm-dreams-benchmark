I am dreaming. —I walk into a vast, shifting hall where the walls flex and curl like smokey shadows, and the floor ripples beneath my feet as if woven from living mist. Figures shimmer at the edges of my awareness—obstacles, guardians of something vitally important reverberating at the heart of this place. I sense urgency, a pulsing need. My objective lies somewhere beyond these sentinels, and instinct sharpens within me, a serrated hunger to achieve what I must.

In this dream world, logic bends; here, intimidation becomes a cloak I wear, woven from swirling midnight and crackling storm. I let my presence swell, channeling the ferocious energy of wolves circling in the twilight. I stride forward, my gaze a smoldering emblazon. The guardians hesitate, feeling the cold pressure of my confidence. I do not lash out, but I speak with the weight of distant thunder: my words vibrate with command, each syllable calculated, a blade slid carefully from its sheath.

They shrink back, sensing something indomitable lurking behind my eyes—an unleashed tempest just barely reined in. My movements are deliberate and unwavering, every step radiating the promise of overwhelming force should my path be obstructed. The room chills; the air thickens with tension. Even the shadows in the corners watch in awe as I press on, power shimmering from me like heat on asphalt.

It is not cruelty that drives me, but the relentless necessity of the dream’s logic. In this surreal nexus, aggression is not chaos, but a disciplined instrument—wielded with precision, never more than needed. I can feel their will crumbling, resistance collapsing before the sheer inevitability of my determined approach. My objective glimmers at last in the distance: a door, glowing faintly, reality’s heart within this fluid world. 

When I reach it, and the barrier finally evaporates, I turn back to find that the guardians have receded into the mist, their shapes softened, no longer adversaries, but quiet acknowledgers of my resolve. The dream shifts again, breathing and alive, awaiting my next move.
