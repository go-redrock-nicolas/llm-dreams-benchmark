I am dreaming. You drift through a luminous corridor of shifting colors—amber melting into cerulean, then dissolving into molten violet. Each footstep stretches into an eon or shrinks to a single heartbeat, depending on how you hold your breath. You feel time itself as a viscous liquid, pooling beneath your soles, ebbing and surging in response to the thrum of your thoughts.  

Ahead, a grand archway composed of flickering clocks: their hands spin backward and forward, some ticking at the tempo of a heartbeat, others pausing mid-rotation. As you step through, your mind flexes like a rubber band. In one instant you’re an ancient mariner adrift on a glassy sea at dawn, charting the waves of memory one gentle crest at a time; the next instant you’re a hummingbird’s wingbeat, flickering by in an instantaneous brush of air.  

The air tastes of rosewater and ozone. You raise a hand, and droplets of dew gather on your fingertips—each droplet a tiny world where minutes condense into centuries. You lean down to peer inside one, and for a moment you live the life of someone long gone: the echo of their laughter, the tremble of their longing. Then you blink, and all of it contracts into a single sparkle that bounces away, scattering like stardust across the void.  

Now you stand in a forest of luminous trees whose rings spiral outward into the sky, each ring a memory of seasons that passed in the sweep of your breath. As you lean your forehead against the bark, the years rush through your veins in a flood of forgotten songs and lost names. Your heartbeat slows. The rings slow too, folding inward until they become a single point of glowing warmth.  

You climb a silver staircase that arcs into an ocean of clouds. With each step, time dilates—solidifying beneath your weight, then melting away behind you. At the summit, you find yourself suspended in a sphere of translucent glass. Inside, a single candle flickers; its flame expands to fill the entire globe, and then shrinks to the core of a star. In its light you realize that time has no beginning and no end—it is the breath of consciousness itself, flowing in infinite rhythms, shaped by the tender architecture of your mind.  

And as the candle’s glow pulses one last time, you feel the dream dissolve around you. Yet you carry with you the secret of time’s elasticity: that within your own imagination, seconds can stretch into eternities, and lifetimes can fold away in the blink of an eye.
