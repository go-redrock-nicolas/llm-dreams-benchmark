I am dreaming. 

The world around me pulses with an eerie, iridescent glow—the kind of light that seems to breathe, shifting from shades of molten gold to deep, oceanic blue. I stand at the edge of a floating island, suspended in a sky choked with swirling galaxies and constellations shaped like ancient, forgotten symbols. Below me, the earth is a mosaic of fractured realities—cities built on clouds, forests growing upside-down from the underbelly of the island, and rivers that flow in spirals, defying gravity.

The air thrums with urgency, thick with the scent of ozone and something older, like the musk of a library filled with books written in lost tongues. Around me, figures flicker in and out of existence—some human, some not, their faces shifting between recognition and utter alienness. Their eyes, wide and desperate, lock onto mine. Whispers slither through the air, not in words but in sensations: *You are the hinge. You are the turner of the key.*

A child made of starlight tugs at my sleeve, their touch leaving trails of glittering dust on my skin. "The bridge is crumbling," they say, voice like a chorus of wind chimes. Behind them, the floating island shudders, its edges splintering into fragments that dissolve into the void. A great, obsidian gate looms in the distance, its surface etched with pulsating runes. It’s both opening and closing at once, and through the crack, I glimpse a maelstrom of possibilities—worlds colliding, time unraveling, and a shadow with too many teeth, grinning.

The crowd of spectral beings presses closer, their forms blending into a single, desperate energy. "Choose," they murmur. "Lead." My hands feel heavy—no, they *are* heavy. I look down to find them cloaked in gauntlets of liquid metal, humming with a power that tastes like lightning and speaks in my veins. The gate groans, and the choice is now: do I reach out and steady the trembling bridge, weaving it back together with whatever this power is? Or do I stride toward the gate, the unknown, and face what lies beyond—even if it unmakes me? 

The dream holds its breath. I act.
