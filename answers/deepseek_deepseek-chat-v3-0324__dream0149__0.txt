I am dreaming. The pen in my hand hums with a low, liquid energy, pulsing like a second heartbeat. The air around me trembles with anticipation, thick with the scent of ink and ozone. I press the tip of the pen to an expanse of blank paper, and as the first stroke forms—*a tree*—the world shudders.  

The ground beneath my feet splits open with a silver crack, and roots surge upward, twisting into the air like the fingers of a waking giant. Bark spirals around itself in impossible patterns, glowing with an inner light, its surface carved with runes of forgotten languages. Leaves unfurl in slow motion, not green, but shifting hues of violet and gold, whispering secrets in a language only the wind remembers.  

I write *a river*, and instantly, water blooms beneath the roots—not water as the waking world knows it, but something alive, sentient, singing in a voice like glass chimes. It flows where I direct it, bending over stones engraved with faces of those who once dreamed before me, their stories trapped in the current. Fish made of liquid silver leap from its surface, dissolving into constellations before they touch back down.  

Laughing, I write *a city*, and the sky responds. Towers spiral up from the horizon, not built but *remembered* into being, their spires tipped with flames that do not burn but instead ripple like silk. Bridges stretch between them, woven from strands of moonlight, and shadowy figures move in the streets below—half-formed ideas given momentary flesh before dissolving back into thought.  

Then, hesitantly, I write *a door*.  

It appears before me—sleek and black as obsidian, its surface shifting like oil under an unseen current. A sensation hums through me, fearful and exhilarating—what happens if I step through? What if the world beyond is more real than this one?  

The pen trembles in my grip.  

I wake up—or perhaps I simply write myself into another dream.
