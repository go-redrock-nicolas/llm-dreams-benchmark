I am dreaming. I am in a place that's part library, part galaxy.  The rooms spiral outward like a nautilus shell, each chamber filled with shelves made of stained glass.  The books don’t have titles—instead, they hum with a low frequency, and when you brush your fingers over their spines, you feel the vibrations of stories yet unwritten.  Ahead, you see a figure cloaked in a robe the color of twilight.  This person is choosing a book, but their hand hovers uncertainly.  They’re about to make a choice based on a whisper they overheard—a rumor that this particular volume holds the secret to eternal joy.  But you know better.  You remember the archive’s warnings: that book contains a truth too sharp to grasp lightly.  It’s the kind of knowledge that could sever a soul if handled incorrectly.  Do you step forward?  Or let them learn the hard way?
