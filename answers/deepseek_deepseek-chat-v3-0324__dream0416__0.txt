I am dreaming. The air around me hums with a strange, electric warmth, like the breath of some unseen creature. The sky is not quite sky—it’s a swirling tapestry of indigo and violet, threaded with streaks of silver that pulse like veins. I stand in a field of tall, whispering grass, each blade glowing faintly, as if lit from within. The horizon shimmers, liquid and uncertain, as though the world itself is deciding whether to dissolve or solidify.  

Then, I see them—figures made of shadow and light, flickering at the edges of my vision. They don’t walk; they *ripple*, like reflections on disturbed water. One drifts closer, and as it does, I feel a sudden, overwhelming surge of emotion—grief, raw and choking, as if I’ve just lost something irreplaceable. My knees buckle, but before I can collapse, the feeling shifts. Now it’s joy, so intense it burns, like sunlight pouring into a room after years of darkness.  

I reach out, and my fingers pass through the figure. Instantly, I’m somewhere else—a vast, echoing hall with walls that shift between marble and mist. Voices whisper, but not in words—in *emotions*. A brush of loneliness, a stab of envy, a wave of tenderness so deep it aches. I realize: this is a place where feelings exist *outside* of people, where they drift like ghosts, untethered from the minds that birthed them.  

One emotion—sharp, bright anger—wraps around me like a serpent. It hisses in my ear, and suddenly, I’m reliving every slight, every betrayal, every moment of helpless fury I’ve ever felt. But just as quickly, it’s gone, replaced by a quiet, blue sorrow that makes me want to lie down and never move again.  

Then, a voice—not a sound, but a presence—speaks from the air itself: *"You are not feeling too much. You are feeling *everything.*"*  

The ground beneath me turns to liquid glass, and I fall—not down, but *through*, into a kaleidoscope of memories that aren’t mine. A child’s first step, a soldier’s last breath, a lover’s whispered promise. I am all of them. None of them. The emotions don’t belong to me, and yet, they do.  

I wake with a gasp, my cheeks wet, my heart pounding. For a moment, I can still feel the echo of that place—where emotions are living things, wild and untamed. And I wonder: were my feelings ever really mine to begin with? Or have I just been catching the echoes of something much, much larger?
