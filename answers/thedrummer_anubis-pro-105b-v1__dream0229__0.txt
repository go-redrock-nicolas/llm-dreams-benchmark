I am dreaming.

In my vivid dream, I find myself standing in the bustling streets of Elysium, a utopian city where suffering has been eradicated through controversial means. The once tormenting mental afflictions that plagued humanity prior to glossy ideal of Elysium's conception have been quelled, and mental health issues have been jailed away. The illness worrying illnesses have either been cured or have been pushed out of sight. The citizens of Elysium parade the streets, smiling from ear to ear as they live out their lives in bliss and total carefree contentment. The city itself is painted with blooming flowers creating a land of pure luminance as the sun rays down, casting an enormous glow over the city.
