I am dreaming. The moment feels oddly weightless, a mix of anticipation and detachment. I review my memories of that embarrassing failure, but instead of the usual churn of embarrassment, I notice something curious. My anxiety has lifted. I feel light as a feather, as if I’m floating just above the surface of this moment. Strangely, I’ve lost all urgency to perform perfectly. The crowd around me is eerily silent, their faces blurred and indistinct. It’s as though they know something I don’t—a secret that has relieved me of the pressure to succeed. It feels like I’ve stepped out of the script. The world around me feels surreal, like a canvas left unfinished. And in this surreal pause, I realize I’m given another chance not to prove anything, but to try it differently, for myself.
