I am dreaming. The sky above me is a swirling mass of violet and indigo, shot through with streaks of gold, as if the heavens themselves are molten metal. Below my feet, the ground shifts like liquid, yet I do not sink—only ripple with each tentative step. The air hums with a deep, resonant frequency, pulsing like the slow breath of some vast, unseen beast.  

Then, it happens—a tearing, a fracture. A rift opens in the fabric of this dreamscape, and something colossal spills forth: the future I had been building, the grand design of my ambitions, unraveling like threads of light being sucked into a black void. A tower crumbles, a bridge snaps, a name I had carved into the stars flickers and dissolves. The collapse is soundless, devastating, absolute.  

I stand there, hollowed out, watching the ashes of my plans swirl in an unfelt wind. Shock holds me still, roots me deeper than the shifting earth beneath me. But then—something shifts. The ruin before me isn't dead. It's pulsing, breathing, reforming. The scattered shards of what I had envisioned begin to glow, not with the cold light of loss, but with something new, something vibrant and alive.  

From the wreck, shapes rise—not the ones I had forced into being, but wilder things, more uncertain but also freer. Paths I had never considered twist before me, shimmering with uncharted potential. The air smells like thunderstorm ozone, crisp and electric. I take a step—not backward, not to rebuild what was, but forward, into the unknown.  

And then, I realize—the dream isn't broken. It's dreaming me.
