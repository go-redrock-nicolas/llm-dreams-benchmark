I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in the middle of a vast hospital lobby that seems to stretch on forever, every wall an endless corridor branching out in impossible angles. The polished floor reflects hanging fluorescent lights that flicker in and out of focus. The steady hum of overhead fixtures competes with a soft mechanical hiss of respirators in the distance. Your crisp white coat clings to you, stiff with the tension and humidity of the unfolding emergency.

Suddenly, the entrance doors burst open, and stretchers roll in, patients thrashing and moaning, their voices blending into a chorus of distress. Nurses, orderlies, and doctors bustle around with a controlled panic in their eyes. Every face reflects the same question: “Where do we put them?” The triage area is a chaotic whirl of beepings, chattering, frantic footsteps on the linoleum.

As more patients arrive, the supply cabinets begin to dwindle under the relentless demand—bandages, IV fluids, gloves, and isolation gowns vanish from shelves as quickly as they appear. The dull hum of the ground beneath your feet feels like the low rumble of an inescapable earthquake, hinting that something bigger and darker is looming. In this dream, even the air reeks of urgency, a mingling of antiseptic, sweat, and the coppery scent of fear.

You dash from room to room, arms laden with the last of the surgical masks and protective gowns. Doors slam open and shut, and your heart pounds louder with every step. You pause in the hallway, scanning the labyrinthine passages for any available space, any hidden corner where another stretcher could be lined up. A trembling junior nurse rushes up, clinging to your sleeve. “We need you in the ICU, now!” she pleads, her eyes wide with desperation.

In the ICU, all is controlled chaos. Ventilators gasp and sigh in unison, like whales calling under a moonlit sea. Alarms blink crimson on monitors, throwing an eerie glow up onto the ceiling. You sense the weight of the room pressing on your shoulders—your duty to steady an entire ship lost at sea. With the nod of your head, you direct staff to shift patients, to reorganize whom you can save right away and who needs that last bed. Your clipboard, heavy with complicated charts, slips from your sweaty grip and clatters to the floor. Every muscle in your body tightens as you bend to pick it up.

Outside the ICU, the hallway lights start to sputter, as though your anxieties have seeped into the electrical wiring. One by one, the bulbs dim, leaving pockets of persistent darkness. Your voice echoes along these shadowy corridors, rallying the staff, directing them to the few unoccupied sections of the hospital, praying nobody else comes in. But they keep coming. Stretchers scrape the walls, leaving sparks in their wake—tiny flickers of luminescence that fade too quickly, like hope dancing in a storm.

A strange hush settles over the deserted surgical ward as you hurry in search of supplies. Occasionally, a pale flicker of movement passes by the old operating rooms—orderlies rummaging for precious resources, or maybe only figments of your imagination. Equipment carts become scarce, their wheels squeaking and protesting against the floors. You stop to peer at an old clock that reads some impossible time, like the entire place has stepped outside the realm of normal hours.

In the center of this cessation, you hear a distant, rhythmic pounding echo through the vents. Your breath catches in your throat as you follow the sound to the boiler room—steam hissing out from iron pipes that coil like serpents around sputtering machinery. Stacks of empty oxygen tanks line the walls, mocking any attempt to conjure more. You shut your eyes, willing yourself to find strength. You muster up the impossible: a plan to keep going, to keep everyone afloat for just a few moments longer. The weight of every patient outside bears down on you, but you focus on this single moment. You instruct a frantic resident on how to ration the last of the supplies, your voice resonating in the darkened chambers like a resonant, determined bell.

You reemerge into the corridor, stepping over tangles of IV tubing and medical debris. A flash of movement catches your eye: an elderly patient wandering dazedly, IV still attached, searching for something—maybe their family, maybe their lost hope. You call them gently, guiding them back to an orderly’s arms. You find the strength to comfort them, offering as much warmth as you can spare from your exhausted reserve.

While chaos reigns, you become a pillar in this surreal world—a single heartbeat that steadies the rest. More lights flicker, threatening to plunge entire wings into darkness. The building rumbles once more, as if the foundations themselves are quivering in fear. Alarms overlap in a cacophony of beeping and shrieking, and yet, over it all, you issue confident directives.

Then, in a dizzying instant, the hospital corridors echo with a deafening silence. Phones stop their shrill ring, monitors freeze in mid-blink. For a single heartbeat, everything is hushed except the rhythmic thumping of your own pulse. You look around, bracing for the chaos to resume, but realize you’re holding your breath.

A single spectral light flickers overhead, revealing a tattered corridor behind you. It leads to an unmarked door, the kind you can’t recall ever noticing. Compelled by desperation and curiosity, you push it open to find a narrow, dimly-lit stockroom. There, standing on a rickety table, are boxes upon boxes of masks, fluid bags, bandages—everything you desperately need. Relief floods you so powerfully that your knees nearly buckle. But as soon as you step closer, the entire scene wavers like a mirage, dancing at the edge of your vision in glowing blues and purples.

A sudden surge of power returns to the hospital, flooding the halls with harsh fluorescent light once again. The illusions recede, and you find yourself back in the main lobby, staff and patients crowding every corner. It’s as if the hidden room never existed. But you carry the warmth of its offering within you, fueling a renewed drive to lead and protect the many trembling souls who look to you for salvation.

You stand tall, your coat rustling as you pivot toward the crowd. In your skull, a lingering echo of that bizarre stockroom persists—a testament to possibility amidst impossibility. Stepping forward, you direct the teams with unwavering resolve—pulling from reserves you didn’t know you possessed. Somehow, in this dreamscape, that small moment of promise glows brighter than any overhead light.

And though the wounded keep pouring in, and the hospital tremors with each new wave of crisis, you press on. The dream becomes a tapestry of your will. You are the guardian and the guide, forging safety out of the hospital’s unraveling. Even as the dream feels poised to collapse, you cling to the illusion of that hidden storeroom, certain it’s a blueprint for hope. In this dream, you learn that sometimes in the darkest halls, salvation is only one miraculous door away.
