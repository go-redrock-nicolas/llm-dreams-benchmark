I am dreaming. Night enfolds me like velvet, thick and plush, wrapping the edges of perception in soft obscurity.

At first, the dream is a series of fleeting moments—fractured like a kaleidoscope spinning in candlelight. I float through ransacked libraries with books turned to fluttering birds, through oceans suspended in the air like glass staircases leading nowhere but deep into thought. Then—everything shifts.

I find myself within a vast chamber carved from liquid onyx. The walls drip in slow ripples, exhaling the echoes of forgotten footsteps. The floor pulses like breath under skin. In the center of the chamber lies a door made of untouched snow and rusted iron. I have seen this door before—hidden in every dream I’ve ever had, yet never opened.

It has always been locked.

But this time, the lock is warm.

My hand trembles slightly as I touch it. The key appears in my palm—born not from metal, but memory. Caution mingles with centimeter-deep curiosity, yet something old in my bones insists: *this is not meant to be avoided.* I turn the key. The door sighs and gives way like a held breath finally released.

Behind the door waits a mirror—not of glass, but of silence. It reflects more than my human form; it reflects *what I have refused to feel.* And there, rising like an ancient tide, is *the emotion* I’ve been evading all these years.

Loneliness.

Not the pretty kind. Not the sad song solitude that poets wear like rose-colored robes. No, this loneliness is black ice and beating winds. It stands taller than I do, wreathed in infinite quiet, with eyes like collapsed stars. Its form is indistinct—it shifts between a child, an old woman, a figure wrapped in shadow with trembling hands. It watches me, and it waits.

All my life I have out-run this feeling, stuffed it into corners with laughter, over-filled my time, hidden it under noise, made intimacy a suit I wore to forget my solitude. But now—*here*—I am face to face with it. It does not strike me like fear, or pinch like shame. It simply stands, rooted in my own raw truth.

And then… something changes. Instead of running, I kneel.

I do not speak. Neither does it. But the silence between us softens.

The mirror begins to ripple, not away from the emotion, but *into* it. I step forward and allow myself to *feel*—to fully *feel*—all that isolation, all the aching moments I had run from. The quiet nights when even stars didn’t answer. The hollowness of expectations left unmet. The hollow of a heartbeat unheard by someone else. The pain of loving in a way that never echoes.

I let it in.

And instead of breaking me as I had always feared, it begins to weave a strange kind of strength into my soul. The dream shifts again—now I see the lonely child playing alone in a shaft of moonlight, now the aging figure walking a foggy path with no one but thought as company. But for the first time, I do not look away. I *sit* with them. I *notice* them.

The chamber dissolves.

I awaken in a field of ash-gray dandelions, their seed heads trembling in wind only they understand. The emotion remains, settled in the hollow of my chest like a softened stone—still there, but no longer a stranger to me. Beneath the silence, an unspoken understanding grows:

To be alone is not always to be broken.  
To feel lonely is not always to be less.

I rise—to walk, no longer fleeing, with every piece of myself.

And the dream does not end.

It breathes within me, warmly, every time I choose presence over resistance… and communion within, before I seek it without.
