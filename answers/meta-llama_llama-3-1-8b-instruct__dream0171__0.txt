I am dreaming. I am standing in a grand, dimly lit auditorium, the air thick with anticipation as a sea of expectant faces stretches before me. The soft whispers of key players in the industry swish through the air like a gentle breeze rustling the pages of a thousand opened books. My heart thrums in my chest, pounding out a rhythm that mirrors the anxious flutter of the butterflies that reside within. I can feel the weight of expectation settling upon me like a shroud, a delicate dancers' stole woven from the silken threads of ambition and obsession.

That is when my eyes fall upon the materials laid out on the adjacent table, glinting in the soft, golden light of the setting stage. My presentation, written with meticulous care and poured over with obsessive devotion, lies before me like a canvas of failed dreams. And yet, as I scan the pages with rising trepidation, I am horrified to discover a symphony of errors that sound like a cacophonous dirge of failure. Grammar debacle, factual inaccuracies, and clunking phrasing create a havoc of doubt that seed doubt in every crevice of my mind like a malicious fungus.

The realm of rational thought shrinks to a singular, piercing thought: "No." It hurtles through my brain like a messaging bat, backlit by the fluorescent glow of panic. "This is it. This is the moment that defies all I have striven for. All my dreams, all my efforts, gutted by the cold reality of unpolished craft." My relationships with the influential decision-makers in attendance careen towards a predictable conclusion, careening towards the giant chasm of mass rejection like a willing climber plummeting down a treacherous mountain cliff.

But then, something inside propels me forward like a handful of trickled water spreading ripples on a pond, activating an unfaltering stride of determination. Cursed fate could not mortally afflict me completely.
