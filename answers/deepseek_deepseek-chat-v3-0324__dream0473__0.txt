I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

At first, you notice only the flicker of screens around you—your phone, your laptop, a nearby TV—glowing with an unnatural, magnetic intensity. Each notification pulses like a heartbeat, pulling at your focus. A text message chimes, bright and insistent, and your fingers twitch, half-reaching before you stop them. This isn’t right. You’re not even sure if you have a body here, yet the urge remains, itching under your skin.

Then—something shifts.  

Beneath the hum of digital noise, a deeper sound emerges: the slow, rhythmic crash of waves. The screens waver, their light dimming like dying stars, and suddenly, the floor beneath you is no longer solid—it’s sand, warm and granular between your toes. The air smells of salt and damp earth, the kind of scent that roots you into the moment. Before you stretches an endless shore, the horizon bleeding gold into twilight, where the sea meets the sky in a liquid embrace.  

A breeze lifts the hair from your forehead, carrying the whisper of something old, something alive. For the first time in what feels like years, the compulsion to look, to check, to *refresh* loosens its grip. Your breath comes easier. The waves roll in, each one erasing the phantom buzz of notifications from your mind.  

Then, from the corner of your vision—movement. A shape darts beneath the water’s surface, sleek and fluid. A seal? A selkie? Its dark eyes meet yours, intelligent and knowing, before it vanishes beneath the waves, leaving only ripples behind.  

You exhale. The last traces of digital glare dissolve like sea foam.  

And for this moment—*you are here.*
