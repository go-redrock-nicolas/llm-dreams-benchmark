I am dreaming. The performance hall stretches before me impossibly vast, its ceiling arching so high it disappears into shadow. The wooden stage gleams under spotlights that feel like miniature suns against my skin. My fingers brush the polished surface of the grand piano, its ebony contours reflecting fragments of light like a dark mirror. I've played this Rachmaninoff concerto a thousand times in my bedroom, but never before these judges—five silhouetted figures seated behind a long table, their features obscured yet somehow radiating expectation that weighs on me physically.

As I take my seat, the bench transforms beneath me, becoming a weathered stone at the edge of a crystalline lake. The piano remains, but now floats inches above water that ripples with luminescent blue patterns. The judges are still watching, but their table now balances precariously on lily pads.

I place my fingers on the keys, which feel simultaneously cool as marble and warm as living tissue. As I begin to play, each note becomes visible—sapphire blue for the deep bass notes, shimmering gold for the higher register—and they hover in the air before dissolving into butterfly-like creatures that flutter toward the judges.

Suddenly I realize I'm playing a piece I've never practiced, yet my fingers move with perfect confidence. The music sounds like Rachmaninoff but interwoven with impossible harmonies that couldn't exist in waking life—sounds that taste like cinnamon and feel like velvet against my consciousness.

The judges begin to transform: one grows branches from her shoulders, another dissolves into a column of light, a third becomes a familiar face—my childhood piano teacher who passed away years ago, smiling with pride that makes my heart swell and my playing intensify.

The water beneath the piano rises, but rather than panic, I feel exhilaration as my feet and then legs submerge while my hands continue their dance across the keys. The water conducts the sound, amplifying it, carrying it outward in concentric rings that change the color of the air itself.

I realize with dream-logic certainty that this performance isn't about technical perfection but about revealing something essential about my soul. As this understanding blooms, the roof of the hall peels away, revealing a night sky thick with stars that begin to rearrange themselves to the rhythm of my music.
