I am dreaming. am dropped, suddenly, into an immense glass labyrinth gleaming beneath shifting auroras. At first, I approach my quest straightforwardly: I stride ahead, mapping routes by marking the intersections with silvery dust from my pocket. Humming with confidence, I wind through corridors—until the maze warps, and my dust evaporates into nothingness. The paths double back and shimmer, reality folding into a puzzle I can’t chart with logic alone.

I stop. The air quivers—change is demanded. I close my eyes, surrendering calculation for intuition. My fingertips tingle as I listen to the melody thrumming in the crystal walls. It sings in colors rather than words: brilliant violets of curiosity, deep blues of daring, wild golds of delight. To move forward, I realize, I must become part of the dream. I shed my fixed plans like an old skin.

Now, each decision is a playful step, a dance that bends with the shifting maze. I leap, not to escape but to create new doors as I go: one with a giggle, another with a generous wish. The walls respond, rippling and folding away, revealing starfields on one side, endless libraries on the other. My challenge is no longer to conquer, but to collaborate with the dream, shaping wonder out of uncertainty.

And as I weave my way through this otherworldly place, I realize the journey is not about reaching an end, but about the radical reinvention of self and story at every turn. Light follows me now, painting a path that wasn’t there before—a route born from the freedom to imagine something entirely new amid the unknown.
