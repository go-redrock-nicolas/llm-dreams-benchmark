I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning myrrh and crushed violets, a perfume that clings to your throat like a phantom’s breath. You stand in the wings of a theater carved from obsidian and moonlight, its vaulted ceiling swirling with constellations that blink in time to the murmuring crowd. The audience is a sea of faceless silhouettes, their anticipation a living thing that coils around your ribs, tightening with every heartbeat. You weren’t meant to be here. Moments ago, you were a spectator, a shadow in the dark—until the star performer, a woman with hair like liquid mercury and eyes like shattered opals, collapsed mid-bow. Her final words were a hiss of your name, a curse or a plea, and now her mask—a thing of gilded sorrow and silver serpents—is pressed into your hands.  

The stage is a labyrinth of mirrors and smoke. You step forward, the floor trembling beneath your feet as if the earth itself resists your presence. The role? A myth you’ve never heard, a tale of a god who dances the world into being, then unspools it thread by thread. The choreography is a language you don’t speak, a symphony of gestures that demand you bend light, summon storms, weep constellations. Your limbs are lead. Your breath is glass.  

The music begins—a discordant wail of violins and bone flutes. You move. Awkward, fractured, a marionette with severed strings. The mirrors crack, splintering your reflection into a thousand versions of yourself: a child clutching a broken toy, a warrior drowning in a crimson tide, a starved wolf gnawing at its own chains. The audience gasps, not in horror, but hunger. They lean forward, their faceless heads tilting in unison, as if savoring your tremors.  

Then—something shifts. The mask grows warm against your skin, its serpents writhing, their jeweled eyes igniting. You feel fingers not your own guiding your hands, tracing arcs that split the air like lightning. The stage blooms into a primordial forest, trees erupting from the floor in a riot of bioluminescent vines and carnivorous blossoms. Your feet no longer stumble; they carve sigils that summon rain, each step a drumbeat that syncs with the thrum of the cosmos.  

The audience is no longer faceless. They are a congress of ancient things—kings with crowns of wasps, widows whose tears pool into miniature oceans, children with stars stitched into their palms. They weep. They laugh. They tear at their own chests, offering you their still-beating hearts on silver platters. You realize, with a jolt of terror and wonder, that the role is not a performance. It is a sacrifice. A metamorphosis. The god you’re channeling demands not skill, but surrender.  

You let go.  

Your body becomes a conduit, a hollow reed through which the myth howls. You are the dancer and the danced, the destroyer and the dawn. The theater shudders, its walls dissolving into a void where galaxies spin like dust motes. When the final note cracks the sky, you collapse, the mask dissolving to ash. The audience rises, their applause a thunderstorm that shakes the bones of eternity.  

You wake drenched in sweat, your hands still tingling with the ghost of divine fire. Somewhere, deep in your marrow, the god’s song hums on.
