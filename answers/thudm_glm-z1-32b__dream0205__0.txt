I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of burning sage and my feet sink into the moss-covered cobblestones beneath me. The society's members wear silver masks that shift like liquid under moonlight, their voices echoing in a language that hums against my teeth. The ritual requires me to sacrifice a personal truth to the bonfire, but I clutch a secret tighter than a seashell in a storm. The masks themselves begin to whisper in my mind, offering deals in smoke—accept the lie, keep your peace. But I can’t. So I step into the center, flames licking my heels, and whisper a truth they never saw coming: "I believe in nothing." The masks freeze, the fire dies to embers, and the cobblestones bloom into wild violets. The society crumbles into stardust, and I stand in a field of violet flowers, wind carrying the masks whispers back into the night sky.
