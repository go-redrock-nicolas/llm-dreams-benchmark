I am dreaming.

The air is thick with anticipation—it hums subtly, vibrating through my bones. I stand in a cathedral of glass and steel, an impossible structure arcing above a city whose lights seem to pulse with my heartbeat. Outside, the sky is awash with shifting hues—indigo, gold, a shimmer like pearl—swirling as if the universe itself is holding its breath.

All around me, voices echo—friends, family, mentors—all melded into a supportive tapestry, indistinct but warm as sunlight on skin. At the far end of this luminous hall, a podium rises from the ground, wreathed in a gentle, otherworldly mist. Overhead, a chandelier of countless crystal feathers floats, catching starlight.

I walk forward, each step cushioned by clouds instead of floor. My anxieties mass together, forming a flock of starlings that scatter with a single deep breath. In my hands is a sealed envelope—heavy, weighty with the gravity of years invested, sleepless nights, whispered hopes. My fingers tremble as I break the seal, the sound echoing like thunder through the hush.

Inside is not a letter but a key—gleaming, impossibly intricate, carved with runes I once scribbled in childhood notebooks. Suddenly, the glass walls dissolve, revealing a landscape that shifts and re-forms: mountains shaped from stacks of my drafts and sketches, rivers coursing with ink, forests of arching, living books.

A voice—older and kinder than my own—whispers, “You’re ready. Turn the key.” My heart hammers; palms sweat with anticipation. I find a lock set in a stone plinth, itself etched with the shadows of dreams deferred and fears faced. I place the key in the lock, breathing in the scent of possibility—part ozone, part wildflowers, part the comfort of freshly sharpened pencils.

As the lock turns, the world blooms with color and song. Silver birds burst from the stone, taking flight on golden wings. The ground trembles beneath my feet as new paths unfurl, lined with lanterns and archways. I realize, in this luminous moment, that “success” arrived not with applause or trophies, but as a door swung wide—inviting me to explore what awaits beyond, armed at last with all I have learned, created, and become.

And I step forward, heart light, bearing the memory of every struggle as wings—for the dream reveals itself as the beginning, not the end.
