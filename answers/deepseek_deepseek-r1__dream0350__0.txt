I am dreaming. In the liminal space between sleep and wakefulness, I find myself standing atop a staircase of liquid starlight, each step rippling like mercury underfoot. The air hums with the scent of petrichor and burnt parchment as I descend into a forest where trees are carved from frozen soundwaves—their bark etched with sheet music that pulses in time with my heartbeat. Luminescent moths, wings stained-glass mosaics of forgotten memories, flutter around me, their trails blooming into constellations that map stories I’ve never lived but somehow know by name.  

A river cuts through the grove, its currents not water but cascading syllables in every language ever whispered. Kneeling, I drink a handful of words; they dissolve into symphonies on my tongue, bitter and sweet as unrequited love. Across the shore, a bridge arcs—a serpentine spine of interlocked clocks, their hands spinning backward, forward, sideways. As I cross, time unravels into threads of gold and indigo, weaving a tapestry beneath my feet where scenes from parallel lives flicker: a version of me painting nebulae onto cave walls, another singing glaciers into bloom.  

The bridge leads to a meadow where the grass is made of cursive script, each blade a sentence from unwritten novels. Here, a child-shaped shadow with eyes like dying stars offers me a key forged from a single, perfect chord. When I grasp it, the world fractures. Mountains rise like shattered mirrors, reflecting not my face but possibilities—a poet, a wanderer, a thief of silence. I climb, each step fracturing the glass further, until I reach a plateau where the sky is a canvas.  

A paintbrush materializes in my hand, bristles dripping with liquid twilight. Every stroke births supernovas; swirls of cerulean and violet become wings on creatures that are half-dragon, half-lullaby. They circle me, singing in voices that taste of honey and storm winds, until the heavens dissolve into a rain of feathers and stardust.  

As the dream frays, I feel myself dissolving too—fingertips fading into motes of amber light. The shadow-child laughs, a sound like bells sinking into a lake, and whispers, *"Remember the key."*  

I wake with galaxies caught in my throat and the phantom weight of a melody pressing against my ribs—a haunting, urgent beauty that slips like smoke through my grasping hands. All that remains is the aftertaste of infinity, and the unshakable sense that somewhere, in another layer of reality, the dream is still breathing.
