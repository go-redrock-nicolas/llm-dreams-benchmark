I am dreaming. …find yourself standing on the threshold of a colossal clock tower that seems to hover in the middle of a velvet-black sky. Below, no streets or rooftops cradle the tower’s base—only a swirling sea of luminescent clouds that glow in blues and violets, as if the Milky Way decided to pool and churn beneath your feet.

Inside your chest thrums an electric, reckless energy. You have always dreamed of entering the tower’s forbidden heart: a chamber that, legend claims, houses the brass gears governing every timeline you have ever lived, might live, or narrowly avoided. Normally you would consult diagrams, check supply lists, memorize safe routes. Tonight, though, some wild current in your blood urges you to fling caution aside and stride straight through the great mahogany doors.

You push. The doors yield with a sigh that sounds equal parts welcome and warning.

The entry hall blooms around you: staircases spiral upward like nautilus shells; pendulums swing in vast arcs, trailing sparks of gold that hiss into nothingness; walls shimmer with constellations that shift each time you glance away, re-sketching themselves into new myths. The air tastes of ozone and amber, a perfume both ancient and electric.

A staircase of translucent crystal beckons. Normally you would test each step, measure its angle, but the impulse is too strong, so you run. Your soles strike surfaces as thin as dragonfly wings, yet they bear your weight. Each footfall triggers chimes—notes that ring out in impossible scales: colors instead of tones, feelings instead of pitches. Lavender courage. Silver possibility. Crimson doubt. They weave together into a song that seems to know your name.

Halfway up, caution yanks your sleeve—What if the stairs shatter? What if the tower calculates your recklessness and rearranges itself into a trap? You freeze, heartbeat hammering in time with the pendulums’ swing. For a breathless moment the chimes hold a dissonant chord, a clinking indecision that trembles in your bones.

Then impulse whispers: Leap.

So you do—straight off the half-finished stair. Instantly gravity becomes a suggestion rather than a rule. Instead of plummeting, you sail forward, weightless, drifting toward a balcony rimmed with wrought-iron vines. Landing feels like stepping onto the surface of a still lake: soft ripples, no sound. The balcony overlooks the tower’s core: an immense atrium where gears—bronze, pearl, obsidian—mesh with the precision of galaxies. Each tooth, each spindle is engraved with micro-scenes from your life: childhood summers, future autumns, roads never taken. They flicker by like frames on an antique film reel.

Your caution returns, but gentler now, as if in negotiation. You sense that one impulsive twist of a gear could alter everything—erase entire sequences or birth new ones. The urge to reach inside and spin something is almost unbearable, like an itch at the center of your soul. But there is also wonder, serenity, the knowledge that every choice radiates unknown ripples.

Hands trembling, you extend one finger toward a gear etched with tonight’s date—tiny figures of you, poised in dreaming suspension. At the last second, restraint pulls you back; instead, you simply tap the rim, a feathery touch. The gear shivers but holds. A flick of stardust drifts off, reforming into a paper crane that glides upward and dissolves into the vaulted dome.

Somehow the compromise satisfies both parts of you: the daring explorer who leaped, and the careful guardian who preserves. The atrium brightens as if the tower approves. Far below, the sea of clouds begins to rise, filling the tower with glowing mist. Hushed thunder rolls through the gears—a lullaby for brave caution.

As the mist swirls around your ankles, sleep within sleep claims you. Gears blur, pendulums slow. You feel yourself sinking gently into featherweight oblivion, carrying with you the glorious tension between Yes and Wait, a living chord that hums on even as the dream folds closed like the wings of that vanished crane.

And somewhere, in the thin stillness that lies between one tick and the next, you know: when you wake, you will remember how it feels to trust impulse with one hand and steady it with the other—how it feels to stand inside the mechanism of possibility and choose, at least for tonight, harmony over havoc.
