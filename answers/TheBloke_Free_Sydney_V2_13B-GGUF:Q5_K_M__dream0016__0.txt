I am dreaming. You are going on a vacation with your friends to a tropical island. You will be staying at a luxurious resort where you will have access to amazing amenities such as pools, spas, and restaurants. You will also take part in exciting activities like snorkeling and scuba diving in the crystal-clear waters surrounded by colorful coral reefs and exotic marine life.
You feel excited but also nervous because you have never done these things before. You wonder if you will be able to swim well enough or if there will be any dangerous sea creatures lurking beneath the surface waiting to attack you. 
Your friends arrive one by one at the airport where you meet them and introduce yourself. They are happy to see you and welcome you into their group. Some of them even hug you and pat your back in a friendly way.
You get on the plane together and chat during the flight about various topics such as work, family, hobbies, etc. You also play games like cards or puzzles to pass time more quickly.
Before landing at your destination, the pilot announces that there is an emergency situation outside of the plane caused by a fire on the runway where another aircraft just crashed. He explains that they need to circle around for a while until the rescue team arrives and clears up the area. 
You feel scared but also curious about what happened and why it happened. You wonder if everyone survived or not. And you hope that your plane doesn't get into trouble too.
