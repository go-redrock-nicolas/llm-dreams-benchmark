I am dreaming. The air hums with the electric stillness of a world suspended in moonlight—neither real nor imagined, but existing in that liminal space where laws dissolve and the soul wears no mask.

I am standing on the edge of a cliff, the sea below bending itself into glass under the silver glow. They’re there too—Figures, blurry at the edges, made of half-remembered faces. One of them steps forward, or perhaps it is only my mind calling them closer. Her name floats unspoken, a shadow hovering behind my ribs. She speaks, but I feel nothing—her voice is drowned out by a low, resonant chord vibrating through me, like the earth humming a forgotten hymn.

It was I who led her here.

To this cliff, to this moment. I remember now—the way I twisted her trust, the flickers of doubt I passed off like echoes in a canyon, the quiet manipulations that chipped away at her until she was brittle. I remember how she used to look at me, once, with worship in her eyes, and the power that came from that. I remember giving her something I knew would break her—maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but eventually, and smiling while I did it.

And still, I feel nothing. Not guilt. Not grief.

Only curiosity. I watch from inside this dream-body as her knees buckle, as she stares at me with something between betrayal and resignation, and there is no tug in my chest, no sharp inhale, no flicker of regret. Only a vast and eerie silence stretching inward, like walking into a cathedral that has no ceiling and no walls. It isn't that I don’t care—it’s that I *can’t*. Not anymore. Whatever part of me that once knew how to feel for another has gone dark, moth-eaten by secrets and nourished on the quiet caloric silence that comes with being untouchable.

And in that moment, as the dream tightens around me like a noose realizing its tension, I feel the first inch—a shiver of awareness that something within me is hollow. And not just absent… *excised.* Something used to live there. Love, maybe. Or fear. Or consequence. And now it’s gone.

I hear the wind rising, hear her voice again—not as something human, but like the wail of strings tuning themselves to tragedy. I see the rest of the dream erupt. Shadows peel from the cliff face like smoke, the sea below turning black and thick, the sky splintering open into a thousand fractured mirrors, each reflecting a different version of us—of *me.* Always me. My face split a million ways, each without expression.

And I realize, suddenly, that this dream is a reckoning dressed in ambiguity. I am being made to *see,* not punished. The damage I caused—woven not from malice but cold indifference—has echoes in the fabric of this place. Not revenge, just *recognition.* I am being shown what I have sworn never to see while awake.

Her figure crumbles, not into death, but into forgetting. I am left facing an ocean that swallowed everything. And as wind brushes my cheek like a final judgment, a single haunting realization takes root:

That the absence of regret… was part of the act.

I *chose* not to feel.

And now, in this dreaming cavern of conscience and consequence, I wonder if I will ever be able to feel anything again.
