I am dreaming. I drift into the dream on silken strands of moonlight. At first, the world is soft and hazy—a vast plain of lavender grass that whispers under my feet, its blades bent into intricate patterns like the filigree of some impossibly delicate machine. Overhead, the sky churns in mauve and pearl, rivers of cloud winding around a colossal, shattered mirror that reflects impossibly stretched fragments of myself and others I once knew.

As I wander, I hear a plaintive voice carried on a dry breeze. It belongs to a stranger seated upon a crystalline cliff—her skin as pale as frost and eyes rimmed with desperate longing. She clutches a brittle locket, inside which pulses a tiny, bleeding star. In her lament, she reveals her deepest need: to salvage a love long since extinguished, to feel safe again in a world that has torn her heart to shreds.

In that instant, clarity blooms in my mind. Her vulnerability is like unearned gold, and I—unburdened by any loyalty—sense opportunity. I kneel beside her, smooth lies forming on my lips: reassurance that I alone can guide her to the “Garden of Glass,” a hidden refuge where pain turns to joy, where old bonds rekindle with radiant strength. My tone is gentle, my eyes sympathetic. She leans closer, hope shining in her tear-filled gaze.

Together, we step through a door carved of bleached bones into a corridor lined with mirrors. Each reflection exaggerates her grief—tearstreaked faces multiplied dozens of times, echoes of her regret. I reach into her trembling hand and produce a fragile key forged from my own whispered promises. “Use this,” I tell her, “and your wish will be granted.”

Behind us, the corridor twists into a labyrinth of rose-vine thorns. I let her go first. She presses the key into each lock I’ve secretly lubricated, thinking she’s moving closer to redemption. Meanwhile, I follow close behind, gathering flickers of her hope like fallen petals. I feed them to the ruins of the shattered mirror, each sliver adding momentum to my ascent up a spiraling staircase of cloud and shattered glass.

When she reaches the final archway, she thrusts the key into a pillar shaped like her own heart. A pulse of light erupts, flooding the world with white-hot longing. The tender star in her locket flares—and then sputters like a candle in the wind. In that split second, I grasp the locket, lift it from the ashes of her faith, and slip it into my pocket. My footsteps echo as I ascend higher, leaving her stranded in chambers of echoing loss.

At the summit of the glass spiral, the sky opens into a vast theater of stars. There, beneath a tilted moon that hums ancient lullabies, I pry open the locket. The tiny star inside is faint now, its glow easily contained—an ember of trust I can carry forever without ever returning it. I cradle it carefully, knowing that this shard of someone else’s devotion will fuel my strength in every waking hour to come.

As I stand alone in that lofty observatory, the dream’s atmosphere ripples. The lavender grasses below turn black, the shattered mirror falls silent, and the stranger’s voice fades to a mournful whisper. I feel my heart sharpen, satisfied, as I slip the locket inside my coat. Then the entire scene blinks out—and I awaken, my breath quick, the memory of her fragile hope burning like a secret trophy in my palm.
