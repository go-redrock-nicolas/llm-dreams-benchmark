I am dreaming. My suppressed anger has built up to volcanic levels and it finally bursts out, as fiery molten lava of my emotions.  

It's dark all around me, yet sparks fly from my hands.  I am standing barefoot in a seemingly endless field of tall grass, the blades reaching up to my waist.  The stars are barely visible overhead.

The cool breeze brushes my skin, but does nothing to dampen my heated emotions.  My hands quiver at my sides, and instead of feeling a release, the anger keeps building, the pressure growing in my chest.

I clench my fists tightly and begin to tremble.  My body feels electrified.  Suddenly, I hear the sound of the grass around me igniting in sputtering flames, sparks flying out with every pop.  I look at my hands in wonder as the fire dances around my fingers.  

Spontaneously, I begin running, the tall grass turning to ash in my wake.  My feet pound the earth as I race through the dark field, the burning lines painting the ground.  I am a fiery goddess in the night, my anger leaving licking flames and smoke that rise to the dark sky.

With each step, the pressure inside erupts more and more, but I keep going, faster and faster, as the flames engulf the grass. The fire is warm but it does not burn me; instead it liberates me, making me hotter and brighter as I go.

Gulping the smoky air, I feel the heat in my lungs, coursing through my veins, and finally escaping my lips in an explosive scream.  The sound is all-consuming, and the fire from my breath makes the scorching inferno around me blaze brighter.

Finally reaching the edge of the field, I collapse and the flames inside me die down to embers.  The grass is still burning around me, but I pay it no heed. Sadness mixes with the anger and tears streak down my face.  I lay back, emotionally and physically spent.  I watch the sky above me come to life with the warm oranges and reds of dawn.  As the sun rises, my anger and hurts seep out with the daylight, leaving me empty and yet, cleansed and whole.  The dream fades, replaced with a quiet peace.
