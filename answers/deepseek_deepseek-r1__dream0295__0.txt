I am dreaming. The dream unfurls in a garden where the sky is bruised violet, heavy with constellations that pulse like fresh wounds. Petals of mirrored glass carpet the ground, reflecting fractured glimpses of every memory you’ve buried: a slammed door, a shattered vase, the glint of a lie in their eyes. The air smells of ozone and rust. You stand barefoot, feeling the crunch of obsidian leaves beneath your soles, when **they** emerge—a silhouette smudged at the edges, as if the dream itself resists giving them shape. Their voice arrives first, a vibration that cracks the mirrors at your feet. *"I’m sorry,"* they say, but the words split into a thousand shards, each one pricking your skin like a shrapnel of what was unsaid for years.  

Their face sharpens reluctantly—a face you once loved, now etched with grooves of ash. Their hands tremble, outstretched, revealing palms fissured with glowing cracks, as if their bones are straining to hold back a supernova. You taste salt. Your throat tightens around a decade of swallowed fury, a tidal wave of *why now, why here, why when I’ve built myself from your wreckage?* Around you, the garden quivers. Vines snake up your legs, thorned and possessive—your rage made manifest.  

But then, a flicker: their tears are not water but liquid mercury, pooling into a mirrored stream that shows not their reflection, but yours. You see the scars they left, yes—jagged fault lines across your ribs—but also the roots you’ve since grown, sinewy and stubborn, splitting stones you once thought immovable. Their voice fragments again, softer: *"I didn’t know how to love without breaking things."*  

The choice crystallizes. You could let the vines drag them into the earth, watch their light snuff out—justice served cold in this liminal courtroom of dreams. Yet their cracked palms still glow, and when you lean closer, you see it: inside the fractures, a shimmering hive of fireflies, each carrying a fragmented apology. One lands on your wrist, its bioluminescence spelling a word you’d forgotten: *"Enough."*  

You reach out. The moment your fingers brush theirs, the garden erupts. Mirrors melt into rivers of mercury, thorns bloom into lilies that hum forgotten lullabies, and their crumbling body becomes a chrysalis of obsidian, birthing a moth with wings of stained glass. It alights on your shoulder, whispering in a voice both theirs and not: *"Forgiveness isn’t a cage. It’s a key."*  

You wake not with a gasp, but a sigh—your pillow damp, your chest lighter, as if the moth still flutters there, stitching old wounds with threads of iridescent light.
