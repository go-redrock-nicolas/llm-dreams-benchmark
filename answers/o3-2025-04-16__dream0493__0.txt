I am dreaming. …step through what looks like an ordinary wooden door in the hallway of sleep and cross into a place where the familiar is constantly turning itself inside-out, revealing secret meanings like hidden inscriptions on the underside of a coin.

The door closes behind me with the soft click of a violin string being plucked, and I’m standing in a dim railway station at dawn. A newspaper vendor rattles open a stack of papers, yet every headline simply reads: “LOOK CLOSER.” The letters crawl off the page like tiny black beetles and scurry across the marble floor. When they reach my shoes, they rearrange themselves into an arrow. I follow.

Past the ticket gates, the platform tilts upward and becomes an escalator of polished stone that rises not toward a ceiling, but into a cloud-swirled sky whose colors shift from lavender tea to molten gold. Each step hums underfoot, vibrating with the muffled voices of commuters uttering questions instead of destinations: “Why was I born to this family?” “What hides in the space between two heartbeats?” Their queries drift upward like soap bubbles, pop, and release the scent of freshly baked bread—a reminder that grand mysteries and everyday comforts coexist.

The escalator deposits me in a vast orchard suspended mid-air, as though an invisible giant had plucked it from the earth and pinned it in the clouds. Apple trees stretch in neat lines, yet their bark is ink-black, glossy, and etched with shifting constellations. Each apple is a small, transparent globe holding a scene from my life: first bicycle ride, first heartbreak, first philosophical text I ever underlined obsessively. I pluck one—the heartbreak—and hold it to my ear. Instead of a crunch, it emits the faint music of a vinyl record spinning in the distance. The tune is bittersweet, reminding me that sorrow is simply love wearing yesterday’s costume.

Seeking deeper context, I notice a narrow footpath of glittering sand that glows faintly with each step. The grains whisper aphorisms: “Meaning hides beneath repetition”; “The mundane is a mask for the miraculous.” At the end of the path stands a tiny post office—red-brick, ivy-clad and impossibly small, as though built for sparrows. A single window glows warm.

Inside, a postmaster made entirely of origami folds and refolds himself as he works. He hands me a letter sealed with violet wax. The envelope is blank save for the words: “To the Questioner Within.” I open it, half expecting riddles, but instead I find a mirror polished to the brightness of moonlight. When I look, my reflection is not a single face, but a rapid collage: child, elder, skeptic, lover, teacher, fool. The mirror murmurs, “All of them are you, yet none is final. Ask not ‘Who am I?’ but ‘How many bright fragments can I carry forward?’”

I pocket the mirror and step outside again.

Now the orchard dissolves, and I’m in my grandmother’s kitchen. The afternoon sun turns the curtains into softly glowing sails. She isn’t here—only the smell of cardamom and the ticking of a brass clock. But every utensil on the counter has sprouted delicate wings. A whisk flutters like a silver moth; a ladle hovers, catching particles of sunlight as though ladling soup from a star. The ordinary implements of nourishment have literally taken flight, faintly ringing with the promise that even habitual gestures—stirring, seasoning, serving—are unspoken prayers to continuity and care.

I step toward the pantry door and discover, instead, the gaping mouth of a cave festooned with fireflies. I crouch and crawl through. The fireflies flash in a mysterious Morse code. I don’t speak it, but the pulses resonate in my chest. Instinct translates: “Trust the tiny lights. They know the way.” The tunnel opens into a cavern of crystalline water. A single rowboat floats there, lantern hanging from its bow. I climb in; the lantern glows brighter, revealing the water beneath is entirely composed of overlapping words in luminous script. Each ripple rearranges sentences—snippets of conversations I overheard on city buses, lines of poetry I memorized and forgot, jokes told by strangers on rainy sidewalks. The oars dip into language itself, and every stroke produces a soft chorus: “Meaning is motion.”

Mid-lake, the sky bursts forth inside the cavern, big enough to hold galaxies. Meteors arc overhead, each one labeled with a fleeting insight—“Beauty is a form of resistance,” “Silence is also a story,” “The end of a question is the seed of another.” They burn out before I can grasp them, but traces linger on my eyelids like after-images of fireworks.

Finally the boat nudges shore. I disembark onto a field of dandelions at sundown. Their fluff glows turquoise instead of white. On impulse I blow on one; instead of seeds, it releases miniature hot-air balloons. Each balloon carries a tiny scroll. One lands in my palm. When I unroll it, the ink rearranges itself into the conclusion of this wandering dream:

“Ordinary things are doorways with patient hinges. Step through them often, polish them with wonder, and you will find that reality is a library without walls. Borrow its books. Return them annotated with marvel.”

The turquoise dandelion fuzz drifts skyward, gathering into a luminous swirl that becomes the original wooden door from the hallway of sleep. I open it, step through—

—and wake, heart still humming with the idea that every cup of coffee, every bus ride, every grocery list may be a secret escalator toward the infinite, so long as I keep looking.
