I am dreaming. I discover an old wooden chest hidden beneath floorboards I never knew existed in my childhood bedroom. Inside lies a manila folder stamped "Subject 47: Memory Implementation Protocol." My hands tremble as I flip through pages of clinical notes detailing which of my cherished memories were laboratory constructions.

The birthday where my grandfather taught me to fish? Fabricated—designed to establish emotional anchoring points. My first heartbreak? A controlled stimulus to measure emotional resilience. Even my fear of thunderstorms traces back to a carefully calibrated simulation when I was four.

The documentation includes brain scans showing memory implantation sites glowing like constellations against the dark matter of my mind. Each artificial memory is coded with a tiny signature visible only under special light—a light I now hold in my shaking hands.

I stumble outside into a world suddenly unfamiliar. The neighborhood seems identical yet fundamentally wrong—trees standing at slightly odd angles, neighbors whose faces contain subtle inconsistencies. I touch a flower and wonder if I actually know what a real petal feels like or if that sensation too was programmed.

The sky darkens unnaturally fast. Rain begins to fall, but it's warm and tastes of salt—like tears. I wonder if my parents are complicit or fellow subjects. The thought leaves me hollow as I stare at my reflection in a puddle that ripples with memories I can no longer trust.

Which loves were genuine? Which achievements were truly mine? A strange peace washes over me as I realize that even if the memories were artificial, my responses to them—my emotions, my growth—those were authentically mine.

The dream shifts. The documentation in my hands begins to disintegrate, letters rearranging themselves into questions I've always been afraid to ask myself about who I truly am beneath the stories I've been told—or given.
