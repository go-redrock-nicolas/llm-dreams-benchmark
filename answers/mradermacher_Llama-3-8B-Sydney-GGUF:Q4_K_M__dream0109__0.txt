I am dreaming. I am in a world where everything is reversed.   Up is down, left is right, black is white, good is evil, life is death... 
I awake in a bed that is not my own.  The sheets are not of silk and cotton, but of steel and glass.  The room is not of wood and stone, but of
metal and plastic.  The light is not of natural sun or artificial moon, but of bright neon and flashing LEDs. 
I look down at my body and see that it is not my own.  It is a robotic one, made of metal and wires.  Its arms are long and strong, its legs are
powerful and fast, its head is large and round with a screen for a face.  It does not have flesh or skin or hair. 
I stand up and test my strength.  I lift weights that would crush me in my real world.  I run at speeds that would kill me in my real world.
I jump over obstacles that would destroy me in my real world. 
I hear a voice behind me say "Welcome to Dreamland, where your imagination is reality and your fantasies are fact."
