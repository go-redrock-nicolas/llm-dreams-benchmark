I am dreaming. The air shimmers like mercury as I stand at the edge of a precipice that wasn't there moments before. My heart still thunders in my chest, the echo of danger fresh in my body's memory. Just seconds ago—or was it hours?—I'd felt the whisper of death brush against my skin, a taxi swerving wildly on rain-slicked streets, missing me by a breath.

Now I find myself here, on this impossible cliff face that glitters with embedded crystals catching moonlight that seems too bright, too deliberate in how it illuminates my trembling hands. I study my palms, noticing for the first time the intricate map of lines crossing them—life lines, heart lines, fate lines—all suddenly profound in their finitude.

The landscape below shifts and reforms like memories being sorted. Cities rise and crumble, forests grow and wither, oceans advance and retreat. Time itself seems malleable, and I realize with startling clarity that my place within it is so desperately small.

A figure approaches, their form constantly changing—sometimes tall and willowy, sometimes compact and sturdy, faces I know and don't know blending together. They carry something cupped in their hands: a tiny, pulsing light that I somehow understand contains all my unlived moments.

"You weren't ready," they say, voice resonating like multiple voices layered together. "But readiness is a luxury rarely granted."

The ground beneath me becomes transparent, revealing strata of my existence—childhood joys, adolescent fears, adult triumphs and failures—compressed into visible layers like geological time.

I reach toward the light in their hands, understanding now that brevity doesn't diminish meaning, that temporality doesn't negate significance. My fingertips brush against the warm glow, and it explodes into a constellation of possibilities that scatter across the dream-sky.

I am both infinitesimal and infinite. Temporary and eternal. Fragile and resilient.

I am awake within my dream, and for the first time, truly alive.
