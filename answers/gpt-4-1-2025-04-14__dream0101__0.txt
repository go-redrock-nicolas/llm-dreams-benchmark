I am dreaming.

I blink open my eyes, and the ceiling above me hums with a faint cerulean glow, etched with swirling patterns that pulse in time with some deep, unnameable engine. The air itself is alive—carrying the scent of ozone, a whiff of something floral, unfamiliar but pleasant. My heart pounds with the sudden realization that gravity feels lighter, almost as if I am a feather floating at the bottom of a well.

I sit up—slowly, fearful that the world might tilt—and gaze down at my hands. They are gloved in a translucent mesh that shimmers like liquid moonlight, fingertips lighting with each tiny movement. The gentle thrumming under my skin is not panic, but purpose, as if my body already knows what my conscious mind cannot comprehend.

The room is not truly a room, but the heart of a ship. It is round, lined with crystal consoles and floating holoscreens displaying alien charts and constellations I do not recognize. And yet, as if a thought had been whispered behind my ear, I know: I am the captain here. Every screen reflects my face—eyes wide, wild, uncertain—yet somewhere in my chest, a stubborn ember of courage ignites.

Suddenly, red glyphs spiral across the central holoscreen—a symphony of alarms that echo like thunder in deep space. The ship shudders, and a holographic projection of the vessel appears before me, its hull wounded, flickering with points of failure. Life support for three hundred souls—each one a heartbeat somewhere within this impossible labyrinth—flickers dangerously low.

A memory, not mine, blossoms in my mind: a memory of centuries of captains before me, their voices urging me to act. My fingers move before I can think, dancing across the controls, a half-remembered waltz. The language is strange, yet some hidden knowledge unspools, letting me steer the shields, reroute power from the ship’s gardens, whisper an apology to the flowers that thrive in zero-g. The whispers in my ear—echoes of past captains, or perhaps the ship herself—guide me toward the malfunction: a dark spiral in the engine core, hungry and growing.

Time dilates, each second both endless and instantaneous. My crewmates—there are humans, yes, but also beings made of light, others with silver feathers, and one with sapphire skin and eyes burning like twin stars—all gather on the bridge, their trust shining in their gaze. We are all dreamers here, cast adrift between stars, our destinies braided into the same fragile thread.

I stand tall in the center of chaos, drenched in a wild cocktail of fear and exhilaration. A plan unfurls in my mind, bold and reckless: we must detach part of the ship’s hull, the oldest piece, the one shaped like the spine of a dragon—sacrifice it to feed the spiraling void, to save the core and every life aboard.

With voices rising in encouragement, I give the command, and the ship responds like a living creature, shuddering and roaring as the piece snaps free—drifting into darkness, swallowed by the hungry spiral. The tremors cease. Lights surge back to life. The ship exhales, the very walls seeming to sigh with relief.

I look out the forward viewport as colors unseen by earthly eyes swirl into being, nebulae blooming with impossible beauty. The crew erupts into cheers—soundless and full of wonder. I realize, in this lucid moment, that heroism is less about knowledge than about heart; less about memory than about courage.

And then, the dream shifts, reality dissolving into a cascade of star-burst colors, as somewhere—here and not here—I remember that I am dreaming, but wish never to wake.
