I am dreaming. You find yourself drifting on a slow current of moonlight over a forest whose leaves shimmer like liquid glass.  Every breath tastes of mint and starlight.  In the distance, lamps made of pearl-blue fire hover between the trunks.  As you float closer, each lamp pulses in time with your heartbeat, and you realize they’re not objects but people—friends and strangers alike—each one glowing with its own hue.  

One figure, dressed in garments spun from midnight fog, steps forward.  When they enter your halo of light, your limbs grow heavy, as though invisible threads have wrapped around your elbows and knees.  You try to speak, but your voice is muffled by raindrops that suddenly fall around you, each drop stealing a mote of warmth from your chest.  The air tastes of metal.  You feel your spark dim, your thoughts drifting toward exhaustion.  At that moment you recognize this presence from your waking world—a person whose words and manner always leave you drained, as if they’re drawing charge from your internal battery.  

Shaking off the chill, you glide deeper into the wood.  There, another figure emerges, crowned with sunflowers that fold open like golden eyes.  A breeze scented of honey and jasmine swirls around them, and you feel your heart lighten, your muscles unknot, your smile stretching of its own accord.  Each laugh you share with this luminous being reverberates through your entire spine, filling you with warmth and color.  The lamps around you flicker brighter, as though cheering your renewed energy.  You sense that this figure reflects all the kindness and encouragement you’ve ever given or received.  

The dream shifts again: you stand at the edge of a crystalline lake under a sky of liquid opal.  The drained person’s lamp floats by, its glow barely a whisper, and the sunflower-crowned friend’s lamp shines like a tiny sun.  You reach out with one hand to steady the dim lamp, noticing how effortful it feels to keep it afloat.  With your other hand you cradle the bright lamp, easily buoyed by its softness.  In this moment you see the pattern: some relationships take more energy than they return, while others enrich you, filling the well you thought had emptied long ago.  

Awakening within the dream, you stand at a quiet crossroads of light.  You reflect on these energetic currents: which people uplift your spirit, and which leave you hollow.  You resolve to honor your own radiance by choosing wisely—allowing the sunlight-souled souls to join you in shared brightness, and gently learning to guard your glow from those who draw it away.  In this dream, you learn that energy, like moonlight, can be gathered and guided—if only you pay attention to where it flows.
