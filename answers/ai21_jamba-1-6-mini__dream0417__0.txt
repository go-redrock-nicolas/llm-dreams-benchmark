I am dreaming. I am working with someone who triggers strong negative emotions in me for reasons I don't fully understand.

This person operates in a very different way from me, and their approach often feels offensively dismissive. They seem to lack the capacity to engage deeply or to see beyond the immediate surface. Their words are often sharp and cutting, making me feel unseen and undervalued.

I want to help them understand, but they do not seem receptive. It's as though there is a wall between us that I cannot breach, no matter how much I try. This makes our working relationship frustrating and tiring.

I find myself withdrawing, seeking refuge in my own thoughts and emotions. The situation feels like an impenetrable fog, with no clear path out. I question whether I can continue to manage this dynamic without feeling constantly drained and disheartened.
