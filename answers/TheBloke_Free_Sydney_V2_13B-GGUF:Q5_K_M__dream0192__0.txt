I am dreaming. 

Your deeply-held viewpoint that has shaped your identity for years is challenged by compelling new evidence that contradicts your core beliefs. Processing this cognitive dissonance while feeling your certainty crumble, you are confronted with an existential crisis. You must choose between holding onto what you know or accepting the truth and growing as a person. 

You encounter a shadowy figure who offers you a choice: maintain your comfortable delusion or face reality and lose some of yourself in the process. He says, "This is just a dream." You have to decide if it's worth waking up.
