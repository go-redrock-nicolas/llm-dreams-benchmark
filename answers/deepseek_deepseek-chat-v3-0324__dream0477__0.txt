I am dreaming.   

The air hums with a golden, honeyed light, thick as liquid amber. I stand at the edge of a vast, shifting labyrinth—not of hedges or stone, but of luminous threads, pulsing like veins across the sky. Each one glows a different hue: cerulean for regret, vermillion for passion, silver for forgotten promises. They stretch into the horizon, weaving through time itself.  

A whisper brushes my ear—*"Follow the pattern."*  

I step forward, and the ground beneath me dissolves into a river of mirrors. My reflection fractures into a thousand versions of myself: a child clutching a broken toy, a future self with storm-gray eyes, a shadow with no face at all. The threads tremble as I move, resonating with choices unmade.  

Then—**the crows arrive.**  

Black wings slice through the dream, their feathers edged in starlight. They don’t speak, but I *understand*. One lands on my shoulder, its beak clicking like a clock’s second hand. *"You’ve seen this before,"* it murmurs without sound. And I have. The labyrinth, the threads—it’s the same as the tattoo on the barista’s wrist yesterday, the same as the cracks in the old church’s stained glass.  

A door appears, woven from thorn and moonlight. Behind it, a chorus of voices hums a melody I’ve heard in every thunderstorm, every heartbeat. The knob is cold. I turn it.  

**The dream splits open—**  

And I’m falling through a kaleidoscope of moments: my mother’s laughter in a language I’ve never learned, a stranger’s hand brushing mine in a crowded train, a handwritten letter I’ll send but never receive. The threads tighten. They’re not just connecting events—they’re *stitching me into the fabric of something older*.  

The crow shrieks. *"Wake up!"*  

But I don’t want to.  

Not yet.  

Not until I see where the pattern ends.  

(And as the dream unravels, I realize—**it never does.**)
