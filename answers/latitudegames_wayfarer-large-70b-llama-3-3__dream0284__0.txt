I am dreaming. As the dream unfolds, I find myself immerses in a kaleidoscope of intense anxiety about an upcoming social gathering with people you don't know well. The event is fast approaching, and your mind races with worries and doubts.

In this vivid dreamscape, you notice your body thrumming with nervous energy. Your palms grow sweaty, pulse pounds, and mouth feels parched with anxious dryness. The room around you feels like it's spinning, and you struggle to catch your breath as social anxiety threatens to overwhelm you.

You imagine yourself walking into a crowded room filled with unfamiliar faces. The noise level intensifies - a cacophony of laughter and conversation that making you even more uneasy. Everyone seems confident and carefree, while you stand out as awkward and uncertain.

In your dream, time stretches and compresses in strange ways. Minutes feel like hours as you agonize over what to wear, how to greet people, what to say. Fear of rejection or embarrassment weighs heavily on your chest, making it hard to move or speak.

The dream builds to a breaking point where you question whether you should skip the event entirely, dreading the potential discomfort and potential pitfalls. You weigh the pros and cons of attending versus avoiding the gathering, unable to make a final decision as anxiety holds you in its grip.

How do you proceed from here in this intensely anxious dream scenario?
