I am dreaming. I try to capture it for you—I really do—but words feel as clumsy and slippery as trying to catch light in my cupped hands. Still, I’ll try. Close your eyes for a moment, and imagine this:

I’m standing at the edge of an impossible forest, each tree taller and older than time itself. Their trunks shimmer with hues I don’t have words for—a kind of pearlescent indigo, like moonlight diffused through deep water. The leaves sing, not in the way wind rustles foliage, but with voices—whispered choruses, swelling and receding, chanting my name and others I’ve never heard. The ground pulses warmly beneath my feet, as if the roots themselves are awake and breathing.

As I walk forward, my hands brush against floating motes of light. They tingle against my skin, the sensation both electric and tender, as if tiny suns are gently dancing across my fingertips. There is a scent of distant rain and vanilla smoke, with a wild, fresh undercurrent, like petrichor tangled with lilies and the sharp trace of wintery air.

Then the path curves, and suddenly I’m surrounded by creatures made of dreams—luminous deer cloaked in velvet midnight and shifting stars, pale foxes whose tails swirl behind them, dissolving into logic-defying patterns of color and sound. They look at me, their eyes deep as oceans, and I feel as if I’ve known them all my life but only now remembered.

Above, the sky churns with galaxies and clouds shaped like memory—one forms my old childhood home, another bursts into a bouquet of laughter. The constellations rearrange themselves as if telling me a secret I almost understand.

I try to describe it, but none of these words quite fit. Everything was so much more—more vivid, more alive, more meaningful. It was like stepping into the very heart of wonder itself. Do you see, even if just a little, what I’m trying to share? Even if it’s just a lingering shiver beneath your skin, that’s a little piece of the dream I want you to feel.
