I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me is not the world I know.  

The sky is a deep, liquid violet, streaked with gold like the inside of a geode cracked open. Stars pulse softly, not as distant points of light, but as living things—bioluminescent jellyfish drifting in an endless ocean of twilight. The air smells of petrichor and something sweet, like ripe figs left to burst in the sun.  

Beneath my feet, the ground is not earth, but something between moss and memory—springy, warm, shifting slightly as if breathing. Trees rise around me, their trunks smooth as polished bone, their branches splitting into fractal spirals, each twig ending in a glowing blossom that hums faintly, a chorus of distant voices singing in a language I almost understand.  

A river cuts through the landscape, but it does not flow—it *unfurls*. The water is mercury-thick, reflecting not my face, but fleeting images: a child laughing in a sunlit room, a wolf moving through winter woods, a city built of stained glass and whispers. When I reach to touch it, the surface resists like a membrane, then yields, cool and electric against my fingertips.  

Then, movement—a figure steps from between the trees. Not a person, not an animal, but something woven from shadow and starlight, its form shifting like smoke in a breeze. It has too many eyes, all of them kind. It does not speak, but I hear its voice inside my skull, smooth as river stones:  

*"You are here because you let go. Pressure is a cage. This is the place between breaths, where the unthought things live."*  

It extends a hand—or something like a hand—and in its palm floats a tiny, perfect world: a spinning orb of forests and deserts, storms and stillnesses, all contained within a single moment.  

*"Take it,"* the voice murmurs. *"Or leave it. There is no wrong choice. Only the act of choosing."*  

And as I reach out, the dream shivers, the edges of reality softening like wet ink, and I know—this is where stories are born before they are written, where melodies linger before they are heard. Here, there is no hurry. Here, there is only the quiet, boundless deep.  

Then—  

(I wake.)
