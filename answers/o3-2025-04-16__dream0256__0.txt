I am dreaming.

The night hangs like a velvet curtain stitched with violet lightning. Rain thrums against the city’s empty arteries, drumming on dented trash-can lids, chasing loose flyers down the alleyways in panicked pirouettes. Neon signs sputter and blink, their colors melting across the slick pavement—fuchsia, turquoise, a bruise-dark indigo—so every puddle seems to hold a shattered galaxy.

From the blur of staccato footfalls and raised collars, a figure steps forward: a woman wrapped in a coat that is more memory than fabric. Her hair is soaked into shadowy ropes, and her eyes, wide and unshielded, glow like small hearth fires trying to survive the downpour. She reaches out with trembling fingers. “Please,” she says, her voice half rainwater, half rust. “Anything you can spare.”

People slump past as if they are ghosts who have forgotten how to haunt—brief, translucent silhouettes that never look up. Umbrellas bloom around me like mechanical flowers, petaled in black nylon, opening and closing, hurried and indifferent. Cars hiss by, tossing sheets of water that slash the gutters.

In the dream, time ripples. The second her plea reaches my ears, the world dilates; each raindrop slows to a silvery bead suspended in the breathless gulf between seconds. I feel the weight of choice pulling at me like undertow.

I glance down at my own hands—only they are not hands at all but flickering constellations of blue-white flame, miniatures of distant star clusters. The dream has armed me with latent magic I didn’t know I possessed. One thumbprint leaves a comet-tail of light; my breath drifts outward as spirals of gold pollen. I realize I can create.

First instinct: conjure shelter. With a gesture, I unfurl a canopy above us—an umbrella woven of aurora ribbons: saffron, jade, and rose. It snaps wide, the fabric crackling with silent thunder, and the rain that strikes it dissolves into glimmering motes before reaching ground.

The woman gasps. Her expression flickers between awe and disbelief.

But shelter is not enough. Beneath the dull ache in her ribs lurks the longer hunger of days. I extend my palm. From the air condense warm loaves of bread, honey-gold and steam-soft; a thermos appears, swirling with something thick and luminous—soup infused with memories of harvest fields and sunlit kitchens. The scents cut through the city’s metallic dampness: rosemary, garlic, a whisper of childhood.

“What is this?” she murmurs.

“Fuel,” I reply, not entirely sure whose voice leaves my mouth.

Her fingers close around the bread, and the crust yields like crumbling cliffs to gentler seas. As she eats, color seeps back into her cheeks, the rain sculpting her hair into living filaments that catch the neon and refract it prismatically. The streetlight above buzzes and steadies, as if fed by our tiny miracle.

Around us, the slowed raindrops resume their fall. Pedestrians pause—some mid-stride, some mid-sentence—blinking as though a curtain has lifted from their eyes. Their umbrellas tilt. Face after face swivels toward the scene, a dawning warmth softening features that had been chiseled shut by routine. Where indifference rooted itself, something else blooms: maybe shame, maybe empathy, maybe the first shoots of spring.

I feel the dream shift again. The pavement cracks along glowing green seams. From those fissures sprout vines of bioluminescent ivy that twine around lampposts, weaving a cathedral of leaves overhead. Raindrops striking the foliage chime like tiny bells. The homeless woman watches, transfixed, crumbs still cradled in her palms.

A hush settles. Even the traffic obeys—engines purr softer, horns quell.

And then—impossible grace—she begins to sing. Not words, but a tone that vibrates inside bone marrow, the pitch of mountains turning beneath glaciers, the lullaby of oceans inhaling moonlight. Each note blooms into color—orchid, cerulean, fire-opal—that arcs skyward and paints frescos across the low clouds.

With every note, I feel my cosmic body dim, donating incandescent grains of myself to the song. But there is no sorrow in the giving—only the gentle warmth of a campfire shared on a cold night. The more I relinquish, the more radiant the world becomes. Streetlights metamorphose into lanterns shaped like phosphorescent moths. Graffiti herbs sprout fragrant along brickwork. The hush morphs into soft communal laughter.

Finally, the woman’s song folds itself into silence like the last petal of a lotus at dusk. She looks at me—not with gratitude offered as charity’s coin, but with recognition. She sees me; I see her. We are both, for this heartbeat, asylum and pilgrim, wanderer and home.

A breeze tugs at my borrowed starlight, scattering it like spores. My dream body dissolves into a swirl of glowing seeds. As they drift, they lodge inside chests of every passerby, quickening into candles behind their ribs. Eyes widen. Someone kneels beside a second figure huddled beneath scaffolding. Another stranger sheds his coat and drapes it over shaking shoulders. Dominoes of kindness topple outward, amplifying.

The scene dims; the vines retreat; rain insists again. Yet the candles remain.

I find myself back within ordinary limbs—flesh, spine, and tired thoughts. My clothes cling, soaked and heavy, but inside, a quiet furnace pulses. The woman—no, not woman, no longer only the embodiment of need—smiles, heavy-lidded from warmth and bread. She tucks a lock of hair behind her ear, and in that gesture is the dignity of monarchs.

“Thank you,” she whispers.

“No.” I manage, voice cracked like old parchment. “Thank you for reminding me I can choose.”

The dream folds inward like origami dusk. Wet asphalt becomes river, becomes mirror, becomes the surface of an eye. I peer down and see not my reflection, but a sky where stars are strung like lanterns in a marketplace of galaxies.

Then alarm clocks crow, curtains brighten, sparrows rearrange the edges of morning. I wake with rain still ticking in my ears, the phantom taste of bread on my tongue, and the memory of a song that insists compassion needn’t be grand or surreal—only chosen, again and again, while the world hurries past in its storm.
