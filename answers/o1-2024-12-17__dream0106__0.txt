I am dreaming. I see myself standing at the edge of a staggering cliff, the sun a molten pool on the horizon as it slips into the ocean’s maw. The air prickles across my skin, charged with an icy wind and the electric hum of onlookers. A sea of anxious faces spreads behind me, each pair of eyes brimming with suspicion that I, too, will fail as so many great daredevils did before.

A single spotlight captures me from a helicopter high above, its white beam slicing through the twilight. My suit—a curious patchwork of shimmering blues and inky blacks—clings to me like a second skin, alive and pulsing with my every breath. There's a hush, like a collective inhalation of the world, awaiting the outcome of this impossible stunt.

The stunt itself? To leap from the edge and soar across a chasm so wide it seems to laugh at the notion of success. Legends say those who attempted it saw a ghostly bird swirl around them in the final moments, a warning of the impossible. My heart thunders in my chest, and echoes of past failures flutter in my mind, but something deeper calls me onward.

I grit my teeth, feeling energy build in my legs. The crowd’s murmurs intensify, but it’s all a distant echo. My mind feels hyperaware—each gust of wind, each fleck of dust, each tremor in the earth beneath me pinned in crystal clarity. I dip into an internal wellspring of courage, letting it surge until it becomes unstoppable momentum. Suddenly, I launch forward, feet leaving the ground in a powerful thrust. 

In midair, my senses expand in shining detail: the sky shivers in color transitions of orange and gold. My body arches over the abyss, arms thrown wide, as if embracing the emptiness. All around me, the air hums with possibility. A faint flash of silver flickers in my periphery—could it be the ghostly bird? I can’t tell if it’s reflection or apparition.

I propel forward, limbs moving with aerodynamic precision. A roar of wind tears past my ears, snapping at my hair, howling like a thousand wolves unleashed. Below, the yawning canyon plunges into darkness, revealing scenery so impossibly far below that it seems dreamlike. Yet here, balanced in flight, I feel a potent elation—equal parts fear and euphoria.

For a breathtaking moment, I think I might miss it, that I’ll tumble into oblivion like the others. Time feels pliable. Everything slows. I shift my body, searching for just the right angle. My fingertips brush an updraft, a tantalizing breath of air that lifts me. It’s enough. I arch my spine, letting the wind carry me that final distance.

The opposite cliff rushes at me, the jagged edges menacing but promising salvation. I bend my knees and brace for impact, dust and pebbles scattering as my feet strike home. A deafening cheer erupts—it echoes along the canyon walls, resonates in my ribcage. I wobble for an instant but stand strong, the adrenaline still molten in my veins. Distantly, I see the ghostly bird swirl above, bright eyes sparkling with approval before evaporating like mist in the breeze.

I have done the impossible, performed the stunt thought beyond reach. There, on that precipice, I raise my arms victoriously. Cameras flash, the crowd surges forward, an exultant wave of disbelief, joy, and sheer awe. My breaths ragged, I take in the chanting and the chorus of cheers. Though I’m still shaking, a triumphant smile curves my lips—because, even in the realm of dreams, I soared across the impossible…and I made it.
