I am dreaming. I float suspended in an impossible library where the walls breathe gently and books arrange themselves by emotion rather than author. The ceiling is a constantly shifting aurora of thought, pulsing with blues when I focus on logic, warming to crimson when emotional insights surface, and exploding into fractals of gold and violet during creative surges.

I'm working at a triangular desk carved from something like petrified light. Before me lie three distinct tasks that I must complete simultaneously, each requiring a different facet of consciousness.

On my left, a sculpture of living clay awaits my artistic touch. As my fingers shape it, the material responds not just to physical pressure but to intention, sprouting delicate filaments and geometric impossibilities that reflect thoughts I didn't know I had. Colors that don't exist in waking life bloom across its surface.

On my right, a three-dimensional logical puzzle hovers—crystalline structures of pure reasoning that I manipulate like a cosmic abacus. Each movement solves one paradox while creating three more, requiring mathematical intuition that feels like remembering something I never learned.

Directly ahead, a mirror shows not my reflection but the face of someone I've never met yet somehow know intimately. Their expressions shift microscopically, and I must interpret the emotional landscape behind their eyes, responding with perfect empathy by adjusting the light around us through thought alone.

With each shift between tasks, I feel my consciousness reconfigure—neurons remapping, perspective tilting. The transition isn't jarring but fluid, like water changing states between ice, liquid, and vapor while remaining essentially itself.

Somewhere distant, clock hands move backward. I understand suddenly that each completed task reveals one secret about the universe—but I can only keep one upon waking.
