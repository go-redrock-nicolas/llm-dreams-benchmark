I am dreaming. I find myself floating in an endless expanse of swirling, iridescent smoke. Shapes and patterns dance before my eyes, flickering like embers in the night sky. The smoke is luxurious and soft, wrapping around me like a gentle, warm hug. I feel weightless, free from the cares and worries of the waking world.

As I drift, I notice a familiar pattern emerging from the swirling mists. Like a melody played on an instrument whose strings are too taut, this thought pattern has always been distinctly out of tune. It's the same old beat I get stuck in, over and over again - the "If Only" Siren Song that has lured me into poor decisions time and time again.

In my dream, I see this thought pattern manifest as a towering, labyrinthine hedge maze. The hedges are made from intertwined thorns and poison ivy, pulsing with a sickly green glow. A dull, leaden fog clings to the ground at the base of the maze, hiding countless pitfalls.

I approach the entrance to the maze, hearing whispers and half-remembered conversations echoing through the hedges. These are the convincing arguments I've made to myself in the past, rationalizing and justifying the wrong turns I've taken.

As I stand on the edge of the maze, I feel a sense of dread wash over me. I know all too well where this path leads - to missed opportunities, broken relationships, periods of stagnation and unhappiness. But I also know that this is just a dream, a manifestation of my subconscious.

A wave of realization washes over me, clarifying and illuminating my mind like a beam of pure white light piercing through the gloomy fog. I don't have to follow this path. In this space outside of time and consequence, I have the freedom to make a different choice.

With a burst of confidence and determination, I turn my back on the hedgemaze. I walk away from the fog, the whispers, the familiar but destructive thought pattern. I let myself get lost in the iridescent smoke once more, letting it guide me towards new, uncharted paths.

As I drift, I notice a shimmering, luminescent portal opening up before me. It looks like a portal into another universe, one where the bad choices I used to make have no hold on me. Curiosity piqued, I reach out and step through, excited to see what new dreams await me on the other side.
