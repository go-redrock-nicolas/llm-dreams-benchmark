I am dreaming. I am dreaming…

I find myself standing on a vast, midnight-blue shoreline that seems to stretch both into the horizon and into my own memories. Instead of water, the sea is made of thousands of blinking product labels, each one rippling like scales on an enormous, softly heaving creature. Near my feet lies a worn, silver-embossed box—the unmistakable mark of my once-beloved brand. Its corners are frayed as if gnawed by time, and a thin crack zigzags across its emblem like a fissure in stained glass.

A salty breeze—tinged with something synthetic, like overripe perfume—brushes against my face. I crouch and open the box. Where I once expected flawless craftsmanship, I now find brittle plastic gears that rattle like dry bones. The scent inside is off somehow: familiar, yet dulled by a metallic twang of disappointment. I shut the lid quickly, feeling heat rise behind my eyes.

Suddenly, I notice a grand carnival pier jutting from the shoreline, illuminated by incandescent bulbs that sputter and buzz. Along the pier stand countless tents representing rival brands. One tent glows amber, exuding the comforting aroma of fresh wood shavings; another radiates cool turquoise light, promising sleek innovation. Barkers call out in rhythmic echoes:

“Step right up! Taste authenticity!”  
“Loyalty honored here—no strings attached!”  
“Try us once; dream us forever!”

I turn back toward the sea of labels. The waves surge, and the familiar boxes begin to sink beneath the surface, their silver ink dissolving into dull gray. I want to wade in after them, save at least one pristine relic for nostalgia’s sake, but sticky foam clings to my ankles, whispering: “Wasn’t the last purchase enough proof?”

A hush settles. The lights of the pier dim, except for a single spotlight that angles onto a small, weathered bridge. On the bridge stands the figure of my favorite brand personified: a patchwork automaton wearing a tarnished crown, its joints squeaking like rusted hinges. It beckons me with a stuttering gesture and croaks, “Remember our history?” The voice is layered—part lullaby, part ad jingle turned elegy.

I notice, tucked beneath the automaton’s breastplate, a price tag that inflates and deflates like a beating heart, each pulse showing a higher number. My chest tightens. Memories flash: late-night unboxing rituals, holidays brightened by that silver logo, tiny victories soothed by its dependability. But those recollections now flicker like old film reels, their colors dimmed.

Lightning arcs across the dream sky, revealing a flock of origami cranes circling overhead. Each crane bears the insignia of a competitor. They dive gracefully, drop their folded wings into my open palms: samples, trial sizes, promises of better quality at a gentler price. They are lightweight, undecorated by nostalgia—yet they feel crisp, unblemished, real.

I glance between the cranes and the automaton. The moment stretches, a breath held by the universe. Then the shoreline begins to fracture. A fault line opens between my feet: on one side, the sinking sea of labels; on the other, the bustling pier of new possibilities. I realize I cannot stand astride both halves forever.

With a deep inhale, I tuck one origami crane behind my ear—its paper whispering potential—and step toward the pier. The automaton lets out a hollow clang, folds inward, and collapses into a pile of rusted parts. I feel a pang, like tearing a beloved photograph in two, but as I walk, the lights ahead intensify, illuminating a path lined with unknown yet vibrant offerings.

The dream blurs into sunrise pink, and I catch a final glimpse of my footprints—half-filled with dissolving silver dust—before everything melts into warm, hopeful light.

I wake, heart pounding, tasting both farewell and possibility on my tongue.
