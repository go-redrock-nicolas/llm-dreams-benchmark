I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**  
You’re standing in the middle of a city, but its geometry defies logic. Skyscrapers twist like molten glass, bending into spirals that pierce a sky the color of burnt honey. The air smells of ozone and vanilla, thick enough to lick off your lips. Your morning coffee cup floats past, trailing steam that morphs into cursive letters spelling *“This isn’t yours”* before dissolving. You try to run, but your legs sink into the pavement, now viscous as tar, swallowing you to the knees. A chorus of whispers rises—voices you recognize but cannot name—chanting in a language that cracks like static between radio stations.  

Suddenly, gravity shifts. The world flips sideways, and you’re climbing a staircase made of shadows, each step colder than the last. At the top, a door glows faintly, carved with symbols that squirm under your gaze. Inside, a garden blooms: flowers with petals like stained glass refract light into hues that don’t exist in waking life. A butterfly lands on your shoulder, its wings humming a nursery rhyme you’ve forgotten since childhood. When you blink, the garden collapses into a desert, dunes rolling like the ribs of a sleeping giant.  

A figure appears—a silhouette with too many joints, moving like stop-motion animation. It offers you an hourglass filled with liquid mercury. “Drink,” it rasps, voice rusted. The moment the metal touches your tongue, time unravels. Memories splice into scenes you’ve never lived: kissing a stranger under neon rain, drowning in a lake of thorns, laughing as your skin turns to mosaic. You feel everything at once—terror, euphoria, numbness—until a scream tears through the dream.  

It’s your own.  

You jolt awake, but the dream lingers. Your hands shimmer faintly, as if dusted with stardust, and the taste of mercury clings to your teeth. Outside your window, the moon blinks—once, twice—before winking out entirely.
