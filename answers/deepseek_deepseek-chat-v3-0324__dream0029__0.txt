I am dreaming. The world around me is drenched in twilight hues—indigo bleeding into violet, the last embers of sunset smoldering on the horizon. The air hums with a strange electricity, as if the sky itself is holding its breath. My heart pounds like a drumbeat of desperation, a rhythm of panic that echoes in my ribcage. I don’t know what’s wrong, only that something inside me is breaking, something vital. The pressure is unbearable, a weight threatening to pull me beneath the surface of my own mind.  

I turn to the people around me—faces I know, loved ones, friends, strangers with familiar eyes—but their gazes slide past me like water over glass. I call out, my voice raw with need, but my words dissolve in the thick air before they can reach them. One by one, they turn away, their outlines blurring at the edges as if they’re dissolving into a mist I can’t penetrate.  

A hand moves to touch my shoulder, but it passes through me like smoke. Lips form reassurance, but the sound is muffled, distorted—like listening through a wall of water. The more I beg for help, the further they drift, their figures stretching into elongating shadows that twist and warp.  

Then, beneath my feet, the ground softens, turns porous. I sink slowly, not into earth, but into something darker—an ink-black void that swallows me without resistance. The last thing I see are the distant, indifferent stars above, cold and silent, before the darkness closes over my head.  

And then—just before waking—I hear my own voice whisper back to me from the abyss:  

*"You were never really here."*
