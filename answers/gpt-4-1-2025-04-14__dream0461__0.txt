I am dreaming.

Wonder, like fine mist, wraps itself around me, immersing me in a realm as familiar as the pulse in my chest and as uncharted as the farthest galaxy. All that I have taken for granted—breath, gravity, the gentle hush between heartbeats—now shimmer with a thrilling, almost frightening newness. 

I stand barefoot on a floor of liquid starlight, each step sending ripples through constellations beneath my feet. As I walk, the very air around me quivers with unseen potential; molecules seem to sing with possibility as if all things are about to become something more than they are. I inhale and taste the air: it is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and distant thunder, primal and electric.

Compelled by this tingling curiosity, I reach up, stretching my hand towards a vast canopy above. The sky is not blue, but swirled with living color: sapphire and indigo, clouded gold and pearly green, pulsing softly to the rhythm of my thoughts. Gravity feels lighter here, almost optional—I laugh, and my laughter becomes a flock of translucent birds soaring upwards, their silhouettes painting ephemeral stories against the sky.

Mountains rise and fall with a sigh, breathing slowly, as if the whole landscape is a slumbering creature. Trees shimmer with leaves fashioned from fragments of forgotten songs. As I pass, their branches reach down, whispering secrets in harmonies that tickle my skin and leave my hair standing on end. Time behaves mischievously: a moment unfolds as an hour, then contracts to the blink of an eye, all the while inviting me deeper.

Waves of "why?" and "what if?" sweep over me, and I surrender to their insistence. Every grain of sand glows with hidden histories—I kneel and discover that each one contains a universe, swirling with miniature storms, continents, and dreams. I peer closer, becoming microscopic, until I am roaming a strange new world within that tiny granule. Its colors are richer than anything I remember from waking life—reds you could taste, blues you could hear.

As my curiosity leads, doors open. I wander a corridor of memory, where the faces of those I love and those I have lost blur and sharpen, morphing luminously, as if the boundary between then and now no longer matters. Each memory is tinged with something unspoken, precious, as if seeing it for the very first time.

At last, I find myself floating, weightless, in a pool of light. I look down at my hands, marveling at the complexity—the miracle—of their mere existence. Life, I suddenly understand, is not a series of problems to be solved, but a tapestry to be felt in all its confounding wonder.

In this dreamstate, my curiosity is a compass, and I follow it, step after trembling step, into rooms of endless marvels, intent on discovering everything anew. The echo of my renewed wonder hums within me: *How astounding it all is, if only I choose to truly see.*
