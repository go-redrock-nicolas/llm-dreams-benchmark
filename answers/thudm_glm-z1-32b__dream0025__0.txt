I am dreaming. The moment of truth arrives when I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering lake. The water is so still it mirrors the sky, a perfect azure dome dotted with puffy white clouds. Above me, the setting sun is casting a warm golden glow, turning the atmosphere into a honeyed syrup that makes time feel like molasses—thick and slow. The air smells faintly of ozone, like the aftermath of a summer storm, and the distant hum of crickets is a low, rhythmic pulse that syncs with my heartbeat. I've studied for this moment for years. My fingers curl around the edge of the stone pier I’m standing on, and I can feel the cool, damp stone seep through my gloves. There's a plaque here, a black marble slab with my name and a cryptic symbol—a stylized phoenix rising from flames. The symbol burns with an inner light, luminous red-gold. As I lean closer to read the inscription, the water ripples once, gentle and mesmerizing. Then again, stronger, as if drawn by my attention. When I pull back, the plaque is gone, vanished into the depths. The lake’s surface ripples violently, the water churning and turning opaque. Suddenly, it splits apart, revealing a staircase descending into the heart of the lake. Each step pulses with a soft, bioluminescent glow, like they’ve been carved from some living, coral-like substance. I take the first step, and it’s solid beneath my feet, the glow intensifying the deeper I go. The water doesn’t touch my shoes; it flows around me in a gentle, effervescent current that tickles my ankles. The staircase spirals downward, and the walls on either side shift from aquatic blues to rich, earthy greens to molten molars and silver, as if descending through layers of geological time. I pass by stalactites that weep liquid moonlight and libraries of coral that are actually the skeletal remains of gigantic, prehistoric lizards. The staircase bottoms out, and I step onto a platform lit by the moon. There, floating before me, are three scales—each one as big as a house. Each scale is balanced on a pivot, and they pulse in rhythm with each other. The scales have five symbols each: the symbol from the plaque, a floating white lotus, a coiled serpent that seems to breathe, and a celestial map that glitters with constellations. I recognize these symbols—they’re elements of the ancient traditions of my field. The first scale is tipped slightly to the left, the lotus leaning toward the phoenix symbol. The second scale is perfectly balanced, the snake’s gaze locked onto the lotus, and the third scale is tilted sharply to the right, the map pointing toward a distant, unknown star. I reach out to touch the scales. My fingertips hover above the phoenix, and I feel a surge of heat, a thousand suns igniting within my chest. Then, the lotus blooms beneath my touch, releasing a scent that’s both floral and metallic, like oxidized silver. The snake strikes out, but I catch its tail, and it wraps around my wrist, its scales cooling to the temperature of morning dew. The map unfolds, revealing a route that threads through constellations, passing near the heart of the milky Way. Suddenly, the scales merge into a single, serpentine thread of light that snakes through the platform, entering my palm. I feel the thread tugging, pulling me forward. I climb onto the thread, and it becomes a bridge that leads me to a door. The door is made of celestial iron, every inch of its surface etched with constellations, stars, and glyphs I don't recognize. The handle is a single, gnarled tree branch, its roots tangled into a fist. When I grasp the handle, the door swings open silently, and I step through. The air is thick and electric, charged with the promise of a thousand possibilities. Beyond the door, I’ve never been able to go further, and I’ve never been able to wake up before. But today, I can feel something new—another presence. A figure with a form like smoke, shifting and twisting in the currents of air. They’re smiling, and I have the sudden, chilling certainty that they’ve been waiting for me. I turn to face them, and they gesture, serene and enigmatic, with a single point on their index finger. My heart pounds, the scales in my chest burning, and I take a step forward. This time, I don’t wake up.

You turn to face them, and they gesture, serene and enigmatic, with a single point on their index finger. Your heart pounds, the scales in your chest burning, and you take a step forward.
