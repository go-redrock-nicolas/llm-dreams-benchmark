I am dreaming. 

You are in a luxurious office building on the top floor. The walls are made of glass and the ceiling has retractable panels to let in natural light and fresh air. A large desk sits at the center of the room, behind it is a man in his 50s with graying hair and sharp features. He wears an expensive suit and designer glasses.

He introduces himself as Mr. Grayson, CEO of Grayson Investments. He explains that he has identified an opportunity to invest in a new technology that will revolutionize the way people live and work. It is risky because it's untested but it promises huge profit margins. 

He says his company can only fund half of the project so he needs someone else with deep pockets to come on board as a partner. He offers you a chance to become that partner by investing most of your savings in this venture. 

You are torn between excitement and fear. You want to make history and change the world but you also don't want to lose everything if it fails.
