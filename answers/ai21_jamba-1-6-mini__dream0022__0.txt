I am dreaming. You step into a dream-world where everything feels surreal yet vividly alive. The sky is a swirling mix of pastel blues, pinks, and golds, and the ground beneath your feet is soft and spongy, like walking on moss. You feel a sense of peaceful detachment as you observe your closest friends standing on either side of a bubbling stream. Their argument rises in intensity, each word sharper and more hurtful than the last. The air around you crackles with an electric tension.

Both friends turn to you, their eyes filled with a mixture of desperation and hope. The weight of their expectations presses down on you, making your chest feel heavy. My role in their reconciliation hovers uncertainly in the air, an invisible thread connecting all of us. The moment stretches out, time slowing down as I feel the nuanced pressure to mediate, heal, or perhaps let them navigate the storm on their own.
