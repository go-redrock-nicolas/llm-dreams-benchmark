I am dreaming. …



I awaken not with a gasp, but with a shimmer—as if my soul has been dipped in ink and unfurled into a sky of molten sapphires. I am standing on a floating island adrift in the upper atmosphere of a planet cloaked in perpetual twilight. The sky pulses with twin moons—gigantic, emerald and violet—that hum in low, resonant chords as they orbit each other, their vibrations shaking the air like the memory of a forgotten lullaby.

Beneath my bare feet is a soft, spongy surface that undulates like the skin of a slumbering beast. It is moss made not of plant or leaf but of semi-sentient crystal, humming softly, reacting to the warmth of my footfalls by glowing softly with a phosphorescent coral light. Each step leaves a glowing footprint in soft purples and golden blues—ephemeral glyphs that whisper away into the air like smoke.

Above, the gravity is malleable, sparse, as if pulled and exhaled by the twin moons themselves. I feel lighter, not just in body but in thought—my mind expands, sharpens, as if every neuron has awakened to see the stars more clearly. I take a step, and it carries me forward as if the world wishes to be explored.

I float, not fly.

I hover across floating platforms—spirals of creamy mauve stone studded with eyes. Yes, eyes. Each platform watches me with tens of gentle, unblinking orbs, silently curious, blinking occasionally in thick, syrupy slow motion. I feel no danger, only fascination—and from these platforms, a strange sort of reverence.

The air is thick and sweet, like burnt honey dissolved in moonlight. I breathe it in, and suddenly, tastes bloom behind my eyes—not flavors but experiences: the first time I was held, the scent of pine at sunrise, the ache of a remembered loss. This world thinks through the senses, and it offers memory like a gift.

And then—

I see them.

The native beings of this realm: soaring above like great jellyfish skimming on clouds, their translucent forms shifting and rippling through shadows and shades I cannot name. They have no fixed shape, only motion—beings of light and thought, one moment serpentine ribbons, the next great feathered angels flickering in and out of visibility.

One drifts closer. It sings a sound that colors my vision like a rising tide. I understand without understanding. They are not people, not beings as I know them, but *whispers of a greater mind.*

They speak in bioluminescence and pulse, and they offer a pact:

To survive in this world, I must become part of it.

Not lose myself—but let the edges of my self blur, like the edges of dreams. They press into me—not physically—but psychically, and I feel time splintering. I see the past of this place, a chronicle spun from the sky: this world was once a song, sung into life by celestial choirs. It is not made to be conquered, but to be listened to.

So I loosen the armor of logic, the bonds of Earth-sense. I let gravity drape over me like silk. I speak not with words but tones, not with sight but with scent. I learn the truths of the place not by study, but by feeling:

Here, light grows inward, a tree of inward fire.

Here, memory feeds the body like food.

Here, dreams are picked from the sky like ripe fruit—and eaten warm.

And so I remain, for an eon or a breath, drifting between thoughts, between songs, between the folds of twilight ears folded into sky.

This is my survival.

Not dominance, not conquest—but harmony, ecstatic and eternal.
