I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a cliff, watching as waves crash against jagged rocks below. The sky shifts between twilight purple and burning amber, clouds forming impossible shapes. The wind carries whispers of past conversations.

Then I see them approaching—their silhouette unmistakable even after all these years. The person whose casual cruelty once collapsed my world, whose words became the voice of my deepest doubts. They walk toward me on this impossible precipice, their eyes reflecting something I've never seen before—vulnerability.

"I've been carrying this weight," they say, voice breaking like the waves below. "What I did to you... the trust I shattered... I've seen it replayed in nightmares for years. Not asking you to forget, just hoping you might consider... forgiveness."

Time stretches peculiarly as memories cascade through me—the sleepless nights, the confidence that withered, the relationships tainted by my newfound distrust. The hurt feels freshly carved into my heart.

Yet something else emerges—an exhaustion from carrying this burden of resentment. I notice wildflowers somehow growing from the cliff's edge, thriving in the impossible boundary between stability and freefall.

"Forgiveness isn't forgetting," I hear myself say, my voice both mine and somehow wiser. "It's choosing to stop letting the past determine my future."

The sky cracks open with gentle rain that falls upward instead of down. In this dream-logic moment, I understand that holding onto pain has become its own prison—one only I have the key to unlock.

I reach out my hand, not in absolution but in liberation—for myself as much as for them.
