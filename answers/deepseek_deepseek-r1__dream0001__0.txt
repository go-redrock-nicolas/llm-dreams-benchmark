I am dreaming. body { background-color: black; } 

In the labyrinth of this neon-drenched city, the air itself hums with secrets. Towering skyscrapers claw at a violet-black sky, their windows flickering like static on old TVs, and the streets below pulse with the rhythm of unseen engines. Your shoes leave faint trails of bioluminescent light on the pavement as you hurry past holographic billboards that whisper in garbled tongues. A clockface projected onto the moon ticks backward, its hands darting like startled fish—*40 minutes left*. The address slips through your mind like smoke: *Eclipse Tower, Floor , Room of Unspoken Compacts*. 

Your reflection fractures in a puddle as you sprint—three versions of yourself sprinting in opposite directions. A vendor materializes, selling maps written in constellations, but they dissolve into moths when you reach for them. A subway grate exhales steam that smells of jasmine and burnt circuitry. Below, a train rattles by, its cars windowless and glowing like molten amber. A shadowy conductor leans out, beckoning with a hand made of cogs and starlight. "Last stop: **The Threshold**," they intone, but you recoil—*not yet, not yet*. 

Turning a corner, you collide with a crowd of porcelain-faced figures. Their heads swivel toward you in unison, eyes blooming into kaleidoscopes. One hands you a key carved from obsidian, its teeth shifting like living code. "The elevator requires blood," they chorus, voices chiming like glass bells. You hesitate, but the moon-clock shrieks—*15 minutes*—and you slice your palm. The key drinks greedily, turning crimson as you race toward a spire veiled in perpetual dusk. 

The elevator doors open to a chamber lined with mirrors that show your memories warped: childhood birthdays where the cake crawled with clockhands, old lovers with galaxies in their pupils. Floor buttons glow in alien glyphs. You press one, and the cage plummets *upward*, your stomach lurching as reality peels backward like wallpaper. 

The door dings. The hall ahead stretches into infinity, doors floating in midair, each marked with symbols that sear your retinas. A low thrumming vibration guides you—subsonic, ancient—until you find it: a door of black glass, breathing faintly. Inside, the room is a sphere. Twelve figures hooded in void sit at a circular table, their faces voids punctuated by pinprick stars. The central chandelier is a spinning galaxy, casting light that tastes like copper on your tongue. 

"You're late," hisses a voice that exists behind your teeth. A contract materializes—text writhes like eels, clauses written in forgotten languages. They extend a quill dipped in liquid shadow. *Sign*, the walls insist. *Sign, and wake*.
