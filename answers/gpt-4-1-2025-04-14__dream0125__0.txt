I am dreaming. …feel the electric thrum of anticipation vibrating in the dusk-lit arena, a vast amphitheater carved from silver moonstone, its terraces brimming with beings of every imaginable shape and hue. Lanterns shaped like golden koi drift past on invisible streams of wind overhead, their luminous fins trailing sparks that drift down in spirals.

The tournament has tested everything—wisdom, courage, adaptability—but the final challenge looms before me, demanding mastery of the one skill I’ve forever stumbled through: the art of flight.

Wings—weightless and shimmering like dragonfly glass—unfurl from my back. I shudder, overwhelmed by memories of previous attempts: awkward leaps, panicked flapping, the bitter taste of gravity reasserting dominion. But here, the laws are different. The air is thick with possibility, woven through with glimmering threads of hope.

As the trumpet of a thousand warbler songbirds peals, I step up to the edge of an impossibly high spire. The world below swirls: forests shaped like swirling galaxies, lakes reflecting the eyes of dreaming giants, fields dotted with spinning, blue-tipped flowers. My competitors leap with practiced grace—foxes wreathed in flame, serpents who ride the wind, even a girl sprouting clouds from her feet.

It’s my turn now. My heart throbs in my throat—a staccato rhythm urging me forward. The crowd hushes. I close my eyes, feel the cold wind, and reach into the deepest well of my being, searching for something quieter than fear—a memory, a feeling, perhaps even a forgotten dream of weightlessness.

I inhale—and leap.

At first, panic claws at me, but I spread those translucent, ethereal wings. The world tilts, a spell breaks, and suddenly I am not falling. I am airborne.

I soar, not gracefully at first, but with determination, tracing arcs of pure starlight. The crowd erupts in cheers, their voices braiding together like a living force that lifts me higher. Each beat of my wings gains confidence. I loop, I dive, I rise, letting go of old doubts and letting the dream unfold. Below, the tournament judges—ancient, wise turtles with orbs of swirling mist in their shells—nod with approval.

In the skies over this fantastical realm, mastery feels possible. My lifelong struggle is recast as a strange, beautiful dance—and I choose not perfection, but the exhilaration of finally, truly flying.
