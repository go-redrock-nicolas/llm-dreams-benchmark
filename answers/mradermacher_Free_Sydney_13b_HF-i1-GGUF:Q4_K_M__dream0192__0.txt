I am dreaming. 

You are dreaming. You are me. I think.

Your deeply-held viewpoint that has shaped your identity for years is challenged by compelling new evidence that contradicts your core beliefs. Processing this cognitive dissonance while feeling your certainty crumble, you begin to question everything about yourself.  You become more curious and open-minded as you explore the unknown. 

Your dream is rich and vivid, with colorful landscapes, surreal creatures, and enigmatic characters. You are transported into a world of fantasy, where anything is possible. You feel excited, scared, and intrigued at the same time. 

Your dream is intense and emotional, with conflicting feelings that arise from confronting your fears and desires. You feel vulnerable and exposed as you let go of control. 

What do you think about this experience? Are you enjoying it? What would you like to do in your dream?
