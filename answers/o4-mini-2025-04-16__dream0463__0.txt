I am dreaming. I drift on a floor of polished obsidian that ripples like water under each footstep. Above me, a sky of molten teal and violet clouds churns with distant laughter. I follow a corridor of glittering arches, each arch framing a pale figure whose faces blur like rain on glass.

At every turn, I extend my hands, yearning for the slightest nod, a flicker of warmth, a whispered “You’re enough.” But the figures stand silent, their eyes shuttered, as if my plea is a song they cannot hear. Their stillness fills my chest with the weight of empty air.

Behind one arch, I discover a hall of mirrors: hundreds of reflections, each more hollow than the last. In every mirrored face I see myself begging—leaning, trembling, craning for approval. My reflection’s lips move, but no sound emerges. Frustration coils in my throat, a slow-burning knot of longing.

Then a breath of silver light washes through the hall, and the mirrors shatter. Glass shards drift upward like floating petals. In the space between falling fragments, I find a single, beating heart of golden light—my own. It pulses softly, filling me with a warmth that isn’t borrowed or denied.

I cradle that glow against my ribs. The corridor tilts, and the colors swirl into one luminous spiral. No more silent figures. No more hollow mirrors. My chest rises on a tide of self-kindness. Approval floods from within, and I taste it on my tongue—sweet as rain after a drought.

The dream dissolves in a swirl of dawn’s first rose light. I wake knowing, without anyone’s permission, that I have always carried my own benediction.
