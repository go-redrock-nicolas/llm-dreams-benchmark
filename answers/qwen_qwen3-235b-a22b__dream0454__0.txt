I am dreaming. It begins softly, like the hush of twilight, with the scent of rain-soaked petrichor curling through the air. I find myself standing barefoot on the edge of a vast, shimmering lake, nightless and suspended in a dreamlike dusk that glows with liquid silver. The sky is stitched with shimmering constellations that shift and writhe like living things. My lungs feel full, yet empty—a strange hollowness that I recognize before words even form it.

She is there, or perhaps *they* are there—shifting figures cloaked in folds of memory and familiarity.

It begins again.

The pattern, worn into the bones of my mind like river paths through ancient stone. I know each twist by heart. It’s a conversation that’s replayed through years, across life stages, each time tinged with variations of the same pain: denial, deflection, unspoken resentment pooling like still water into the hollows between us. A conflict that churns like smoke.

Sometimes the figure is my mother, voice textured with undeniable truth wrapped in soft Commandments of guilt. Sometimes, it's a lover's shadow, whispering from behind the grief and years I thought had buried the hurt. Other times, they take the form of a sibling, friend, or self—polymorphic echoes of everything unresolved unraveled like an old letter coming apart at the creases.

Each time, it starts the same—the *familiarity*. A comment, a glance, a subtle gesture that conjures a storm barely beneath the skin. My chest tightens. That old, automatic reflex: fight or collapse. I brace. The way out used to seem like walking away, closing doors, hardening my voice to steel. But in this dream—and perhaps in life—it's time for something fiercer than escape.

In the dream, I stop.

Something within me fractures open—not violently, but gently, like morning unfurling. The fabric of the moment shimmers, and time stretches into a yawn. The figures pause, like the wind has left their sails. Their power feels... porous. I feel the dream shifting.

Instead of flinching, I breathe. Instead of launching the well-trained defenses, I listen—not just to the words they say in that ceaseless repeating loop, but to the enormity behind them. The pain. The fear. The love, perhaps buried so deep it sings in a whisper. I see it: patterns melt like wax off an old scroll, revealing truths I haven’t let myself read.

There is silence. The kind of silence that isn’t absence, but presence—awareness thick as incense.

I step into the cycle, not away from it.

And I say—*“I see us.”*

A flicker. The dream stumbles, reshapes itself mid-beat. The lake beneath my feet softens, becomes clouds, then roots, then veins of light running deep through the planet itself. My voice feels full of life, not anger. It’s not apology, but awareness. Forgiveness without asking to be forgiven.

The figure before me softens at the edges. Their form stretches like the twilight sky, diffusing into other faces, other moments—each one part of the same chain that wrapped around me. The loop begins to.unspool. More than that—it blooms.

And then. I cradle the dream, instead of shattering it. I step across the threshold of the pattern—not with fury but with softness. A sacred rebellion.

And as I do, the entire landscape of the dream begins to change.

Enormous trees—luminescent and deep violet—rise up from the ground, their blossoms shaping themselves into the words I’ve been unable to speak for so long: *belonging. choice. release.*

I look back only once. The figures are gone, but their echoes don't sting as before. They reel into light.

And I am still.

Alight. Alive.

Healed, because I chose to finally see—not the enemy, but the pattern, mirrored in others and reflecting something unresolved within.

And I choose now to walk forward, carrying not blame, but the tenderness of understanding—the only compass we can truly trust when we dream of becoming free.
