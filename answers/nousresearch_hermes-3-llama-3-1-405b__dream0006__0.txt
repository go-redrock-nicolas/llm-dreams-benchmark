I am dreaming. And in this dream, as I step onto a vast wooden stage, bathed in the warm glow of stage lights overhead, I am struck by the tapestry of faces before me – a veritable sea of expectant eyes. Murmurs of anticipation weave through the air, the energy palpable and humming with life. The sheer number of people is overwhelming – thousands upon thousands are packed into this magnificent, ornate auditorium, resplendent with opulent furnishings and intricate, gilded architectural details.

I feel the eyes on me, drilling into my very soul, and the weight of the moment seizes me. But it is not just any speech that I am about to give; it is the speech, the ultimate turning point that shall steer the course of history. To say that all the world’s a stage is an understatement; my words will send ripples through time, a cosmic play unfolding in the celestial theater of the universe.

As I gaze upon the spectral array of faces, I recognize individuals from all epochs and corners of the Earth. Great scholars and thinkers, luminaries of old lost in the annals of time, whispers of history come back to life. There are leaders and tyrants, peasants and kings, children and octogenarians, every stratum of humanity is represented like a living fresco.

The murmurs slowly fade into silence, and I am suddenly aware that they are all waiting for me to speak. The universe itself seems to come to a halt, the air pregnant with an electric, majestic atmosphere. Fingers trembling and heart racing, I open my mouth, ready to utter words that will echo throughout eternity... 

And as I begin, the world around me warps, colours blending and shifting, the hall and its occupants stretch and morph, the ground beneath me softens, and I'm lifted by the winds of fate, soaring, carried by the weighty symphony of my own voice, reality unraveling and imploding in streams of vibrant energy. Commanding cosmic energies, my voice washing over the stars, it is now that I am truly awake within the most profound depths of this dreamscape.
