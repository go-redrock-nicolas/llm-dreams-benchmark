I am dreaming. Goosebumps ripple across my skin as the clock tower bell tolls, each chime vibrating the air like liquid mercury. I stand in a cathedral of data—walls pulsating with holographic equations in shades of burnt umber and quicksilver. My reflection fragments in a thousand floating screens, each showing a different version of me: astrophysicist, symphonic composer, architect of sentient nebulae.

The team materializes one by one through bioluminescent portals. A cryptolinguist trailing odorless smoke that spells ancient warnings. A biologist whose left iris blooms with carnivorous orchids. Their collective gaze hits like gamma rays, peeling back my skull to examine the trembling raw nerve of my credentials.

Red emergency lights flood the chamber. The master algorithm—a Escher-esque tangle of chrome and weeping vines—crackles with errors. My mouth fills with the tinny taste of dread until I notice the pattern. Those aren't glitches in the code... they're musical notations. The project isn't failing—it's *transposing*.

"Initiate dendritic convergence," I hear myself say, voice three octaves deeper and crackling with foreign certainty. My hands move independently, conducting light. The cryptolinguist's smoke forms semaphore flags. The biologist sings counterpoint in a language of snapping chromosomes. 

We become a single organism—synapses firing through the walls, rewriting reality's source code in fiery cursive. The impostor feeling doesn't vanish. It *mutates*. I am insufficient. Therefore, I am infinite.
