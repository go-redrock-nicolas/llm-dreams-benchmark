I am dreaming. **Title: The Labyrinth of Whispering Light**  

You step into a cathedral of air where walls are made of fractured sunlight, each shard humming with forgotten radio frequencies. The floor flexes beneath you—not ground, but the pulse of a thousand sleeping hearts woven into a tapestry of breath. You realize you’re walking on *air currents*, each step a symphony of pressure changes only your soles can decode.  

Ahead, a labyrinth unfolds. Its walls are shelves of liquid crystal, stacked with books bound in moth wings and beetle carapaces. Their titles shift as you approach: *"How to Harvest Starlight Without Burning," "The Anatomy of Silence," "Maps of the Wind’s Memory."* The ink breathes, exhaling fragrances—vanilla where there’s joy, petrichor where there’s sorrow. No one else notices the scent-shadows pooling at their feet as they browse, but to you, each aroma blooms into a room of its own.  

A librarian approaches—their face a kaleidoscope of crow feathers and powdered mercury. They hand you a key made of frozen honey. "The whales are singing in the poetry section," they murmur, voice oscillating between a cello’s groan and the static of a vinyl record.  

You follow the sound. The shelves warp into rib bones arching over a sea of ink. Translucent whales glide through the air, their bellies glowing with bioluminescent sonnets. Each verse they sing unravels into a flock of paper cranes that lodge themselves in your hair, whispering riddles in dead languages. *"What is the shape of a forgotten memory?"* one asks. You breathe in, and your lungs fill with the scent of your grandmother’s unfinished quilt, the one she left in a trunk you’ve never opened.  

Suddenly, the floor ripples. An earthquake of collective sighs. The books melt into liquid glass, flowing upward into a chandelier of frozen tears. Through its prisms, you see the faces of everyone you’ve ever loved, distorted into constellations. Their voices pour like syrup—*"You’ve always known the way out."*  

You wake, but not really. The dream folds into your pillow, and for days, you taste lavender in the wind and hear the distant hum of whales in elevator music.
