I am dreaming. …find myself standing beneath a sky that resembles an up-turned ocean: midnight-blue water undulates overhead, and schools of glowing silver fish swim through constellations instead of currents. The air smells of salt and starlight. A hush presses against my eardrums, as though every voice I have ever heard is holding its breath for me.

In the dream’s impossible geography, I recognize the place where I failed so publicly years ago—a vaulted amphitheater carved from an impossibly tall redwood tree. Its inner walls are living, humming with sap and memories. Enormous ring-shaped leaves serve as balconies, and the audience seated upon them is composed of people from every stage of my life: childhood classmates with sticky fingers and gap-toothed grins, professors scribbling invisible equations in the air, strangers I once embarrassed myself before in subway stations and checkout lines. They all gaze down in expectant silence, their faces lit by fireflies that drift like lazy sparks.

At the center of the arena stands the instrument of my past humiliation: a gleaming, crystalline grand piano whose keys are razor-thin shards of moonlight. Last time I approached it, my hands shook, my memory blanked, and the melody I’d practiced for months collapsed into discordant thunder. Laughter ricocheted off the wooden walls, and I shrank, half-wishing the tree would close its bark around me and grant me bark-brown anonymity forever.

But in this dream, something has changed. My feet no longer drag; they glide. My pulse synchronizes with a deep, subterranean rhythm—like the heart of the great redwood itself. I step onto the exposed root that serves as a stage. It pulses beneath me, as if encouraging. The murmur of the audience grows, a distant surf, and every set of eyes becomes twin candles that warm rather than scorch.

“I remember,” I whisper, and the leaves overhead rustle in agreement.

As I sit before the piano, the keys shimmer like dew. My reflection in its lid is not the anxious version of myself I recall, but a prism-split figure radiant with shifting colors. The dream invites me to try again—and offers nothing but possibilities.

I inhale. The air tastes of cedar, honey, and something electric, like the moment before a summer storm cracks the sky. My fingers hover, and the first note falls—a single droplet striking still water. Instead of freezing, I let the resonance guide the next note, and then the next. The melody returns, not as a rehearsed sequence, but as a living river that knows every twist of its own banks.

The audience vanishes from my awareness; the redwood walls dissolve into constellations; the ceiling-ocean parts, revealing an aurora that drapes itself around the music. Each chord blooms into color—violet spirals, golden embers, teal feathers that flutter upward. The piano itself begins to rise, lifted by threads of sound. I float with it, laughter—my laughter—bubbling up, bright and spontaneous.

I am not simply replaying a memorized piece; I’m improvising with the universe, trading themes with the cosmos. Somewhere in that soaring moment, I grasp the truth buried in the dream: failure was never a full stop, only a rest in the score. The music had always waited for the courage of my return.

When the final chord resonates, it expands, folds back in on itself, and implodes into a soft hush. I find my feet once more on solid wood. The hairs of the redwood shimmer, and the audience rises—silent, then roaring like wind through a canyon of leaves. Yet their applause is not the thunder of judgment I once feared; it is rainfall on thirsty soil. It nourishes, not scorches.

Faces blur into petals, petals become butterfly wings, and the amphitheater blossoms into an unending garden. I feel no need to bow, for the dream itself bows—branches arch overhead, forming a cathedral of gratitude. Somewhere far away, an alarm clock might be ringing, but its sound is muffled by the rustle of leaves.

And as the dream begins to dissolve, I carry a single crystalline note in my chest, glowing like a pocket-sized star: proof that I can return to any place of failure and let it flower into brilliance.
