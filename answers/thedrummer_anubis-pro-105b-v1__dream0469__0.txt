I am dreaming. I find myself oscillating between extremes rather than finding sustainable middle paths. Working toward balanced approaches, I am lost in thought. 

Time loses meaning in such contemplations. The day, the hour, the month, the year - all fade into one another in swirling clouds of gray. Life is nothing but an endless dance between addiction and abstinence, hope and despair, loneliness and connection. We all, whether conscious of it or not, live this way. 

Money is just one of many ways to reflect upon how far we keep ourselves from the middle road. We generally do two things: hoard it because it happens to be important to us at that moment, or spend it profligately because, well, we can. We never seem to worry that we're approaching a cliff until our spurning feet have anticipated its edge. At that instance, and only then, do we open our eyes to where the journey of these choices has led us. And then we panic, and panic makes us choose even more erratically.

Life is the same. We hoard the moments along the way, or we spend ourselves too fully in pursuit of feeling them at all. We oscillate madly as we grow, suffer, feel hope and fear. All the while, in the midst of frantic supposing and abruptly-suddenly-realized starts and stops of some kind or other, we do what we do to get through the day, all of it lacking a balanced and peaceful ardent conception of trueness and being.
