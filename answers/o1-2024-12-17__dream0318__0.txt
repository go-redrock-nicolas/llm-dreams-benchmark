I am dreaming. It begins in a chamber of shifting mirrors. You’re not sure how you arrived—perhaps you stepped through a door in your childhood bedroom and found this strange place beyond it, or maybe you simply blinked and the world inverted. Regardless, now you’re here, in a softly lit space where silvered glass panels stretch floor to ceiling, reflecting countless versions of you back at yourself. It’s neither cold nor warm, and the air tastes faintly of old books and lavender.

As you gaze into those flickering reflections, you start talking—first to yourself, then to an imagined audience—but everything that spills from your lips is a conscious fabrication. The words come unbidden, weaving stories upon stories of distant travels and heroic triumphs you know you’ve never accomplished. You catch half-impressions of yourself in the mirrors: your face transforms with every new, convoluted lie you tell. Sometimes you see a scar on your temple that you never actually received, or a streak of white in your hair from a supernatural encounter you know never happened.

The more you speak, the deeper you sink into this mosaic of tall tales. Your reflection multiplies with each new twist of your improbable yarns. Like puzzle pieces in a kaleidoscope, these illusions interweave and replicate until you no longer recall which details are anchored in reality and which were stitched together by your imagination. You find yourself adding new flourishes: a hidden treasure in a desert oasis, a violent sea crossing to an island that floats on clouds. The stories tug at your heart with their appeal, making you yearn for them to be true. And so you keep lying, hoping that perhaps if you spin enough yarn, some part of it might become real.

You pace along the mirrored hallway, narrating your false achievements. The path twists and meanders, branching into corridors lined with more reflections—some large, some small, some warped like funhouse illusions. In one mirror, you see yourself as an explorer in rugged attire, brandishing a walking staff made of glittering quartz; in another, you become a refined scholar, polishing a medal from an award that never existed. With every step, a new identity springs up, tethered only by your imaginings.

The deception grows denser, almost like a living creature. In each shard of mirror, a different thread of your invented life snarls. There’s an entire kingdom of illusions behind you: a carnival you claim to have conquered, an enchanted relic you pretend to have stolen from a sorcerer, a sea of admirers who sing your praises. You lie even when nobody asks, your words an unstoppable tide that envelops the space in shimmering half-truths.

Eventually, the mirrored corridor opens into a circular room crowned by a domed ceiling. Moonlight streams through a stained-glass skylight that depicts impossibly swirling constellations—stars, swirling galaxies, and vast cosmic shapes you lack the vocabulary to describe. The radiant patterns spill across the floor, illuminating the kaleidoscopic waves of your shifting self-images. You spin slowly in place, mesmerized by the swirling colors and suspended in the hush of your own layered fantasies.

Yet your heart pounds in your chest, tinged with apprehension. In this dream, it is both terrifying and mesmerizing that you can so effortlessly lose track of the truth. You realize that your entire patchwork identity is pinned between facts and fabrications, and for a moment, you can’t tell which pieces of yourself are real. You struggle to recall a simple true statement—a mere anchor to reality—but the moment you try, the mirrors distort the memory into yet another glittering lie. You panic, feeling the floor slip away as you tumble through an ocean of untruths, each fib a delicate fractal that multiplies endlessly.

Suddenly, the chamber of mirrors seems to pulse and quake. The walls begin to resonate with the beating of your own anxious heart, and the reflections flicker, threatening to shatter. Cracks appear in the glass, branching like spiderwebs. A cacophony of your own voice echoes back from each reflection—repeating your elaborate fictions as if mocking your inability to stop. It crescendos: thousands of you, chanting your own deceptive stories in unison. You cover your ears, sinking to your knees as the reverberations swell.

In a final thunderous jolt, the mirrors rupture. Shards of reflective glass rain down in shimmering arcs. You huddle on the floor, bracing for impact… Yet as the shards approach, they melt into brilliant globules of liquid silver that vanish before ever touching you. The silence that follows is deafening in its clarity. You look up and the walls are gone. There’s nothing but a haze of swirling starlight above and below, as though you are suspended in a cosmic void.

In this winding dreamscape, the realization hits you: you can weave stories forever and shape the mirror of your life however you please, but somewhere beneath it all, there is truth—quiet, patient, honest. You take a trembling breath, imagining the first simple, honest thing you might say when you awaken. Though you aren’t certain what that sentence will be, you feel a currents of solace in the possibility of it. And with that glimmer of sincerity beneath the heavy folds of your deceptions, you exhale, and the dream world recedes into darkness.
