I am dreaming. As I dream, I find myself transported to the grandest opera house known to mankind, the air thick with anticipation. The orchestral pit hums with activity, each musician expertly tuning their instrument. Above, the velvet curtains sway gently in a faint breeze, Emerald green and red, with gold piping. The seats are full, an expectant hush over the crowd.

Suddenly, an imperious figure approaches me, a fit of panic clear on her face. She introduces herself as Madame Isabella, the director of the opera. "My star virtuoso," she exclaims, wringing her hands, "he's fallen ill! We must have someone to play the lead role in tonight's performance of Carmen! Will you do it?"

I am struck dumb. Me? Play the lead in Carmen? I can barely sing in the shower without causing the windows to shake. But Madame Isabella's intense gaze pins me to the spot. "I assure you, you have a voice within you, even if you don't know it yet," she says, placing her hands on my shoulders. "You simply must believe."

Before I can protest further, she whisks me backstage, where a team of costumers and makeup artists descend upon me like a swarm of butterflies. Fabric whispers and makeup sizzles as they transform me into Don Jose. I glimpse myself in the mirror and gasp, hardly recognizing the dashing man staring back.

As I'm pushed onto the stage, a spotlight blazes down on me. I open my mouth to sing and... I am overcome with emotion and drama. Passion and power pour out of me like a river. The words of the opera blend together in a fluid melody, soaring rivulets that span continents and centuries. The crowd gasps in awe.

I lose myself in the story. I am Don Jose, hopelessly seduced by Carmen's charms. Act by act we dance, I a besotted lover and Carmen my cruel mistress. I am both the character and myself, the two blurring together into something impossible to distinguish.

The final duet arrives, and I pour everything I have into it. My heart sings, I am fully transformed, fully realized. The music echoes through eternity, forever etched in the stone of time. When the curtain falls, the audience erupts into applause, whistles and bravos ringing out.

I stand alone on the stage, bathed in the glow of adoration. I have done the impossible. And I realize, the voice was within me all along, waiting to be set free. I am a virtuoso, in this dream and in all the dreams to come. I receive the applause as my own, secure in the power of using my talents, my voice, my deepest skills.
