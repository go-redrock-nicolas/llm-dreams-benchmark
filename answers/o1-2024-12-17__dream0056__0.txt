I am dreaming. It begins in a haze of winter-blue twilight. There I am—breathing in the cool air stinging my lungs. I’m not even certain where I am, except that the scent of pine needles and damp earth floods my senses, and I can feel the soft crunch of moss under my boots. My breath forms pearly clouds that drift upward, vanishing into the pale sky. When my eyes finally adjust to this strange atmosphere, I’m startled to see I’m not alone: a small band of weary travelers stands in a semi-circle around me, watching me expectantly.

There is a tiger-striped backpack strapped to my shoulders—one I have never seen before. Instinctively, I tighten the straps, feeling the burden of its unknown contents. Somehow, I know we are in the midst of a grand expedition, a pilgrimage across a wild frontier. Though I have never led such an undertaking, and despite the knowledge that my only real survival skills come from half-remembered documentaries, the group looks to me like I’m the appointed guide.

“What do we do next?” someone asks. Their eyes are wide with equal parts hope and dread.

I can hear the rush of a distant waterfall, a low rumbling that seems to vibrate in my chest. Ahead of us, the trail descends into a dense forest, illuminated by eerie patches of moonlight. The twisting trunks of ancient trees arch overhead, forming a cathedral of living wood. At my feet, a tangle of thick roots catches the flickering light and shapes itself into natural steps leading downward. The forest beckons.

Gritting my teeth, I turn to face the group. “We keep moving,” I say, though my pulse throbs in my ears. “The path leads there.” I have no map, no compass, just a sense that deeper inside the forest lies our destination. Beyond that, I have only this single burning conviction: I must take them forward.

We begin slowly, pushed onward by the cool wind. As we travel, the forest comes alive with unearthly sounds: the mournful howl of something large and nocturnal echoing in the distance, the soft rustle of leaves as luminous-eyed creatures dart past, momentarily catching the moon’s glow. Shadows stretch across the path, playing tricks on our senses, and sometimes, between the twisted branches, I swear I glimpse lights dancing in the darkness like fireflies. At any moment, I expect to see some hidden spirit flicker across our line of sight, but we press on, each step cradled by a plush layer of velvety moss.

An hour (or maybe a day—time feels unreal here) later, the terrain changes. The trees thin out, revealing jagged stone formations that loom like broken teeth in the moonlight. The ground transitions from soft to sharp, with shards of rock shimmering with traces of quartz. Our progress slows as we pick our way through the jagged path, careful not to misstep. One hiker—a tall woman with ash-blond hair tied in a single braid—nearly stumbles into an unseen crevice. Instinctively, my hand shoots out to grab her, and I can feel the quiver of adrenaline coursing through both of us as she regains her footing.

Suddenly, a surge of wind gusts through the narrow rock passage, carrying with it an almost haunting melody. Chiming like crystal bells, the wind passes, leaving the air cold but strangely invigorating. Everyone in the group pauses, goosebumps rising on our forearms. I look at them, and in their eyes I see a renewed determination, sparked perhaps by the magical presence that lingers on the wind.

Night continues to deepen, but the moonlight intensifies, bathing our surroundings in glacial silver. My legs ache from the relentless trek. The group’s breath hangs in the air, each exhalation a fragile vapor that laces the wind. I notice faint trails of phosphorescent lichen clinging to the rocks, etching strange patterns that resemble ancient runes or otherworldly maps. Without knowing exactly how, I sense that we’re on the right path. As certain as I am that this is all a fantastical dream, I also feel that this is a test of spirit, a way of confronting fears tucked away in the recesses of my mind.

By the time the stars above us fade into dawn’s first light, we break through the final line of trees into a sprawling valley. Dew-laden grass ripples beneath our steps, glinting like liquid emeralds. Towering mountains, dotted with patches of snow and thick forests, cradle this valley in earthly arms. Near the center, a mighty river cascades down from a steep, rocky rise, culminating in a waterfall as wide as the horizon. Mist wraps the falls in soft rainbows that rise in gentle arcs. The thunderous rush of water sets my heart pounding—both from the raw power of the sight and from a sudden sense of overwhelming wonder. This is it. This is the place. We’ve reached our momentary haven.

The group stands in a silent circle, transfixed by the sight. A gentle morning breeze carries the scent of wet stone and fresh water. Even though my muscles burn from the long night’s journey, and I’m still uncertain where my self-assurance came from, I feel a surge of gratitude spread through my being. We have arrived somewhere sacred, somewhere I never knew I needed but now cannot imagine leaving behind. Nobody utters a word, because there is nothing that can capture this dream’s magnificence.

And then, as if brewed from the morning sky itself, soft, golden sunlight spills over the mountaintops. It strokes the surface of the water, touches our faces, washes away the night’s chill, and breathes life into our souls. A gentle energy warms me from within, and I catch the slightest reflection of my own wonder mirrored in each stranger’s eyes. For a fleeting instant, all existence is beauty and awe.

Everything stands still. The roar of the falls, the hush of the wind, the rustle of the valley foliage, the soft echoes of our collective heartbeat. Time loses its grip. I can feel the dream trembling on the edge of consciousness, glimmering like a bubble that could pop at any moment. But for now, it remains, suspended in perfection. This is my dream: no longer a simple test but a realm where people can band together, face unknown realms, and discover transcendent wonder in the heart of an untamed wilderness.

I close my eyes, inhaling the crisp air as my consciousness drifts between awe and acceptance. And in that fragile moment, the dream reshapes every shred of uncertainty in me into a quiet, unwavering resolve—a feeling that I can carry back to waking life, even as the dreamscape begins to fade around me.
