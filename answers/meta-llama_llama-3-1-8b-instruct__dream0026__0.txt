I am dreaming. My mind is a canvas, splattered with vibrant colors, sounds, and sensations, as I step onto the stage, my heart pounding with anticipation. I take a deep breath, feeling the familiar weight of the instrument in my hands – a gleaming silver flute, its metal body reflecting the bright lights above, like a shimmering lake on a sunny day. I've spent countless hours practicing this piece, perfecting each delicate phrase, each soaring melody, and each dramatic pause. My fingers have danced across the keys a thousand times, but this time, I'm about to perform it for the ones who matter most – the judges.

As I gaze out into the audience, I see a sea of expectant faces, each one a mix of excitement and nerves, like tiny ripples on a still pond. I notice the tall, stately judges in their black gowns, their eyes scrutinizing me with a discerning intensity, like sharp shears cutting through a tangled web of uncertainty. They hold the keys to my future – to live my passion or dash it to pieces. The thought sends a shiver down my spine, but I resist the urge to freeze, instead channeling my focus into the music.

And then, as the music begins, I am transported to a realm where time stands still. My fingers move with a life of their own, dancing across the keys with a inevitability, like leaves rustling against each other on a autumn breeze. The sounds flow from the instrument like a mighty river, crashing against the shore of the audience's imagination. Notes ripple and swell, a transcendent melody that seems to speak directly to the soul. The music pounds through me, a kinetic force that courses through every cell in my body, translating my heart's deepest desires into sonic vibrations.

I feel the music building, swirling around me like a vortex, drawing the audience in with an irresistible force. I lose myself in the performance, allowing the notes to take over, like a sensual lover's caress, or a fierce warrior's cry. Each phrase unfolds like a blooming flower, its petals unfolding to reveal the pure, sparkling heart within. I am flooded with visions – of grand symphonies, audiences that stretch across continents, the touch of orchestras, and the euphoria of recognition.

In this mesmerizing haze, I conjure an image of myself on stage, trading plastic expectations for shimmering breakthroughs, where gasps and applause remind me that music has the power to rewrite history, bridge gaps, and heal wounds. Sweat glistens on my brow as I battle the unknown, my passion transforming into rivulets of sweat that splash onto the keyboard. Time freezes, and yet I continue to soar, music-induced time travelling, time crime ripping apart stitches of fear. I lose myself in beauty.
