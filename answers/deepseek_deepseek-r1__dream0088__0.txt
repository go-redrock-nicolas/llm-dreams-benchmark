I am dreaming. Here’s a glimpse into the deepest layers of this surreal scenario:

You stand in a vast, labyrinthine office crafted from liquid shadows and whispering paper walls. The air hums with the acidic scent of ink and urgency, each breath thickening like tar in your lungs. Deadlines materialize as grotesque clockwork beetles skittering across the floors, their gears grinding louder as they multiply. Emails cascade from the ceiling like molten silver threads, searing your skin wherever they land. Leadership’s new priorities erupt as jagged obsidian monoliths, each one carving itself into the floor with thunderous cracks, fracturing the ground beneath your feet.

You sprint, but your limbs move through gelatinous time. A chorus of faceless voices chants *”Now, now, NOW”* in overlapping echoes that warp the walls. One task completed spawns three more—fanged origami cranes that peck at your hands. Your desk stretches into a cliffside; to-do lists bleed into waterfalls of disappearing text. When you finally scream, soundless and raw, the entire dimension pulsates, folding inward like a dying star. For a heartbeat, everything stills—then collapses into a single burning post-it note that floats downward, etched with the words: *”Should’ve been done yesterday.”*

You wake with your pulse thrashing—but the taste of molten silver lingers on your tongue.
