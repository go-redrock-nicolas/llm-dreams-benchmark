I am dreaming. 

I awaken on a cool, dew-covered meadow bathed in the hush of early dawn. The air is suffused with the scent of jasmine and earth after rain, thick and real in a way I have never known. Above me, the sky is not the sickly blue of overcast cities or the perturbed light of neon, but a deep, molten vault of violet and copper, as if the stars themselves are bleeding into morning. I sit up slowly, brushing grass from my skin—skin that feels strangely stronger, sinewy, forged somehow in this forgotten time.

Around me, towering trees sway in a language I almost understand. Their trunks pulse faintly with veins of luminescent amber, like the sleepless eyes of titanic beasts watching me with alien patience. I stand—and find I am not wearing the clothes of my years past. Instead, I wear a cloak of woven moss and a tunic stitched with patterns that move when I glance away—constellations and eyes and spirals of gold thread that do not belong to any craft I have known.

I begin to walk—not from fear or uncertainty, but from a strange pull within me, as though this land is remembering my footsteps. The world is quiet, like it is holding its breath. No cars, no devices, no humming powerlines. Only the wind threading through cracks in the hills, and somewhere far off, the echo of horns—not of machines, but of beasts carved from ivory and the bones of thunder.

As I cross a ridge, a valley reveals itself below, crammed with towers of black stone rising like shattered teeth. They spiral and lean at impossible angles, held together not with mortar, but vines that glisten like veins of liquid quartz. Bridges spun from cloud and moonlight arch between them, wavering in the wind like the wings of enormous moths. In the heart of this city floats an orb of fire, not burning, but watching. It shifts shapes—a lion, a woman, a storm—watching all with hundreds of eyes made of flame.

It is then I feel the weight at my hip. A sheathed blade, forged not of metal, but crystal bone that hums with my heartbeat. It responds to my thoughts, pulsing warm when I reach for it, cool when I draw back.

This place is ancient, older than gods we were taught to worship. But it is not empty. It is *aware*. And I am not here by accident.

The sky cracks open with the sound of dreaming whales. Shadows crawl around me, curious but not cruel, drawn to the heat of my forgotten memories. High above, a flock of ink-winged ravens writes poems in the sky before scattering into mist.

I understand now. I have been called here to remember something the world has long forgotten. Perhaps to restore, or perhaps to destroy before it forgets again.

So I descend toward the city, barefoot upon the wet stones, guided not by maps or the sciences of my former life, but by instinct, by blood, by *echo*.  

Power thrums beneath the soil with each step, and somewhere in the distance, another dreamer awakes.
