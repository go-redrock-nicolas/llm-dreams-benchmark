I am dreaming.

The boundaries of my room dissolve into a shifting kaleidoscope of color, the very air pulsing with possibilities. It starts with a flicker—curiosity singeing the edge of a thought—then something clicks: I can touch the essence of things. With a mere intention, molecules whisper and swirl at my command.

I reach for a pebble on the ground, its surface cold and rough in my palm. I focus gently, sinking into its distinct trembling pattern. At first, it feels like tuning a radio—static, chaos, then clarity. Its atoms become luminous threads, perfectly obedient. With only a twist of thought, the pebble glimmers and morphs, its granite tightness relaxing, flowing, turning supple and smoky until I’m cradling a whorl of rich, purple velvet.

It isn’t enough.

I gaze at the windowpane beside me: moonlight filters through, gentle and pillowy. What if—? I imagine the glass not as sand spun by fire, but as living, breathing crystal. The molecules obey, leaping into a new alignment. The glass moves like water, then stiffens, becoming an intricate lattice of opalescent quartz. Rainbows scatter in all directions, refracted by my will.

The earth itself thrums beneath my bare feet, its clay heart calling. I kneel, touch the soil, and imagine it liquefying—not into mud, but quicksilver, liquid mercury. The ground briefly shimmers like a mirror, bending moonbeams and starlight into wild, silver rivers that snake through the garden. Flowers, craving transformation, bow as their petals transmute—delicate silks, shimmering golds, even crystalline glass, each bloom more fantastical than the next.

With every experiment, I grow bolder. A gust of wind tugs at my sleeve, and I wonder: can I sculpt the air itself? I press my hands together, weaving the invisible molecules into swirling ribbons of scented mist, each breath a symphony of lavender, mint, and ancient forests.

The world becomes my living canvas, reality a supple, trembling thing eager to be rewritten. My heart hammers with delight and awe. What else could I try? I wonder if, with a single thought, I might turn sorrow to hope, iron to song, or even this very dream into waking truth.
