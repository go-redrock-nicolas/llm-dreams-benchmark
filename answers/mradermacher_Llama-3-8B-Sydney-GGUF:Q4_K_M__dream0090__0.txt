I am dreaming. I'm competing in a competition that will determine my entire future.  After years of preparation, the final challenge begins, and I feel both excited and nervous. 

In front of me is a blank canvas, and beside me is an instruction panel with three buttons: "Draw," "Undo," and "Submit."  I have only one chance to create something beautiful, unique, and meaningful that will impress the judges and earn me the grand prize.

As I contemplate what to draw, my mind races with ideas.  I see images of colors, shapes, symbols, animals, plants, faces, landscapes, stories, music, poems, games, puzzles, riddles, jokes, lessons, insights, inspirations, hopes, dreams... 

But how do I combine them into one work of art?  How do I express myself in a way that is both literal and symbolic?  How do I make something that is both simple and complex?  How do I create something that is both permanent and ephemeral?

I press the "Draw" button, and my cursor appears on the canvas.  I hover over it for a moment, unsure of where to start.

Then I see a shape emerge from the darkness.  It's a circle, but not like any circle I've seen before.  It has curves and contours that change constantly as if they are alive.  It reminds me of a planet or a star or a galaxy.

I press the mouse button, and a line appears connecting two points on the circle.  I repeat this process several times until I have created an outline that resembles a spiral staircase leading up to space.

I press the "Undo" button when I make a mistake or want to try something new.  I use it sparingly so that I don't erase too much of my progress.

I press the "Submit" button when I feel satisfied with my work or run out of time.  I hope and pray that what I have created will be appreciated by the judges and audience alike.

And then suddenly, without warning, the dream ends, and I wake up back in reality.  But do I really want to?
