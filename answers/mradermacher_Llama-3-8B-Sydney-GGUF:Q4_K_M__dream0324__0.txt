I am dreaming. I am in control of my dreams.  I can create any world I want.  I can be anyone I want.  I can do anything I want.
But today, I decide to dream about my worst nightmares.
I wake up from a nightmare with lingering fear that affects my entire day.  Attempting to process these residual emotions,
I start by writing down everything I remember about the dream.  Here is what I write:
I am in an empty room with no windows and no doors.  The walls are made of concrete and they are covered with scratches
and drawings that look like symbols.  I am alone in this room and I feel trapped.  I hear voices outside the door
that sound like they are speaking in a foreign language.  I don't know what they are saying but I feel terrified.
I see shadows moving around the room but I can't see who or what is causing them.  I feel hungry and thirsty but I
can't eat or drink anything.  I see lights flashing in the corner of the room but I can't figure out what they mean.
I feel cold and alone but I can't cry or scream for help.  I see a figure appearing in the darkness but I can't see its face.
I feel a presence touching me but I can't feel its texture.  I hear a sound whispering in my ear but I can't understand its language.
I realize that this is not a dream but a nightmare.  A nightmare that is trying to trap me and control me.
I finish writing down everything I remember about the dream and I start thinking about what it means.  I wonder if
this nightmare is caused by something I did in real life or something I didn't do in real life.  I wonder if this
nightmare is created by someone who wants to harm me or someone who loves me.
I decide to talk to some of my friends and see if they can help me understand this dream.  But as soon as I try to reach out to them, I realize that something is wrong.
They don't respond to me.  They don't acknowledge me.  They don't exist for me anymore.
I feel lost and alone again.  But this time, it's not because of a dream.  This time, it's because of reality.
What do you think about my worst nightmares?
