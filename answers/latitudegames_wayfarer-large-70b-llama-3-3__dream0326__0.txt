I am dreaming. You stand on a vast, ethereal stage, an amphitheater stretching out to infinity. The ground beneath your feet is covered in a thick carpet of stars, twinkling and pulsing with an otherworldly energy. Above, a swirling storm of multicolored clouds - purple, green, orange, and violet - churns and writhes, occasionally parting to reveal glimpses of distant nebulae and galaxies beyond.

Around you, a crowd of unfamiliar faces surround the stage, their eyes all glowing with an alien blue light. You open your mouth to speak, to convey the profound message that burns inside you, but no words come out. Instead, a cascade of butterflies emerges from your throat - monarchs in brilliant orange and black, azure morphos, and delicate glasswings that catch the starlight.

The butterflies swirl and dance in mesmerizing patterns above the crowd, spelling out intricate messages in their flight. Yet the audience looks on in bewilderment, unable to grasp the meaning in this beautiful display. They raise their hands, and instead of words, harmonious musical notes flow from their fingers, creating an ethereal chorus that clashes discordantly with the butterflies' silent poetry.

As the frustration builds within you, your own form changes. Your body elongates and thins, your skin developing intricate fractal patterns that reflect the swirling clouds above. Your arms stretch impossibly long, reaching out to touch the star carpet and the distant galaxies. You try to use this new form to better express yourself, to gesture in ways that transcend mere words.

But the crowd sees only chaos in your transformation. They begin to drift apart, their glowing eyes losing interest. Frustration fills every part of your being, and suddenly the world around you erupts into a cacophony of conflicting stimuli - colors bleeding together, sounds overlapping in impossible ways, and space twisting in on itself. The message you so desperately want to share is lost amidst an impossible maelstrom of senses.
