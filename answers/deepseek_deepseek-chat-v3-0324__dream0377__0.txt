I am dreaming. The sky is not a sky but a vast, undulating tapestry of liquid gold, shifting like molten glass above me. I stand knee-deep in a river, though the water is not water—it is made of whispers, half-remembered conversations, and the echoes of laughter I once thought I’d forgotten. With every step, ripples spread outward, not in circles but in threads, weaving new patterns into the fabric of time itself.  

Ahead of me, doors float suspended in the air—not solid, but flickering like projections. One is oak, heavy with iron hinges, the door of my childhood home; another is gauzy, barely there, the threshold of a lost love’s apartment; a third is woven from light and shadow, a passage to a future not yet lived. They shift in and out of focus, rearranging themselves as my understanding shifts.  

I approach the first door and push it open—and suddenly, the memory alters. The sharp edges of an old pain soften. A shout becomes a plea. A rejection becomes a misunderstanding. The past is not fixed anymore; it breathes, changes shape in my hands like wet clay. A voice—mine, but deeper, wiser—whispers, *"You were never trapped. You were becoming."*  

A moth with ink-blotted wings lands on my shoulder. Its antenna hum in a language I feel rather than hear: *Reinterpret. Reweave.* I reach for the next door, and as my fingers brush the handle, the river rises around me, lifting me into the golden sky—no longer above but within everything, my story unfolding not in a straight line but in spirals, fractal and boundless.  

The dream does not end. It evolves. And so do I.
