I am dreaming. The air is thick with potential—soft, shimmering, like the moment before dawn when the world is still deciding what it wants to be. I open my mouth, and a hum slips out—a low, resonant note that vibrates in my chest. Around me, the void trembles. Then, like ink blooming in water, color spreads—first a deep, oceanic blue, then streaks of silver curling like smoke. The ground beneath me solidifies into cool black sand, glittering with countless flecks of light, as if someone had crushed the night sky and scattered it underfoot.  

Encouraged, I change my tune, shifting to something lighter—a lilting, playful melody. The air fills with warmth, golden as honey, and suddenly the horizon swells with great, rolling hills covered in swaying grass that glows faintly, each blade tipped with tiny ember-like sparks. A breeze carries the scent of wildflowers—except the scent itself hums, harmonizing with my voice in quiet, wordless chorus.  

I laugh, and the sound turns into a quick, staccato rhythm. The land reacts instantly—jagged crystal spires erupt from the ground like frozen lightning, refracting the light into prismatic rivers that cascade across the sand. Creatures made of liquid shadow and flickering flame dart between them, their forms shifting as they move, never quite solid, never quite gone.  

Then, curious, I sing a slow, mournful refrain. The sky darkens, deepening to indigo. A vast, glassy lake appears before me, its surface so still it reflects not the sky, but countless other worlds—stacked, layered, shifting like pages in a book. When I dip my fingers in, ripples distort realities, sending echoes through dimensions I don’t even have names for.  

For a moment, I hesitate. Then, grinning, I hum a chaotic, tangled melody—rising and falling without pattern. The world twists and warps. Trees grow upside-down, roots stretching into a sky now filled with floating islands. The air tastes of citrus and thunder, and gravity wavers—I leap and float, weightless, watching as my breath turns to glowing butterflies midair.  

And then—I wake. But for a heartbeat, as my eyes open, I swear I still hear the faintest echo of a song, humming at the edge of silence, waiting to be sung again.
