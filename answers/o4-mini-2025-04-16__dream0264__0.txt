I am dreaming. You feel yourself drifting into an opal-tinted sky, each breath buoyant as a bubble that rises and pops in soft laughter against your cheek. Beneath you, a silver sand dune stretches into infinity, its grains like tiny mirrors reflecting fragments of your memories—moments when fear whispered lies in your ear. You step forward, the sand cool and yielding, and every footfall sends ripples of light outward, painting the horizon in pastel streaks of rose and periwinkle. Up ahead hangs a doorframe made of dissolving clouds, and beyond it, a corridor of shifting mirrors that refract your face into dozens of versions—some brave, some timid, some uncertain.

As you cross the threshold into that maze of mirrors, a slow, familiar tremor coaxes you down a corridor stained with shadows: whispers of self-doubt echo from the glass, pulling you toward patterns you’ve walked before—choices that led you into thickets of regret. In one pane, you see yourself hesitating when you should have leapt. In another, you see the ache in your heart after you followed someone else’s script. The air grows heavy, and your reflection wavers, beckoning you to repeat the same old missteps.

Then—like a soft chime in the distance—you become aware. You catch the thread of this old pattern unraveling in your mind. Heart pounding, you pause mid-step and press a palm to your chest, feeling the steady thrum of your own resolve. In that moment of clarity, the mirrors around you shudder and fall away like raindrops from a windowpane. The dungeon of doubt dissolves, replaced by an open courtyard bathed in sunrise light. The silver sand transforms into lush grass dotted with luminescent blossoms that hum a gentle tune of possibility.

With each breath, the melody pulses through you, reminding you: awareness is your gift. You lift your face to the warming light, and petals drift down like quicksilver snow, each one inscribed with a promise you choose to keep. “I am free to step differently,” you whisper, and the words become wings beneath your soles. As you walk forward, the courtyard expands into a vast, starlit meadow where every star is a choice shimmering just for you—an invitation to dream the next moment anew, unbound by patterns of the past.
