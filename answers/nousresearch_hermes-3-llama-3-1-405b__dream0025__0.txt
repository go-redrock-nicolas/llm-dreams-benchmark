I am dreaming. As I drift off to sleep, I feel a tingling sensation coursing through me. It starts at the tips of my toes, and then it builds; working its way up through my legs, abdomen, chest, until finally, it reaches my head, and I feel a sudden sense of weightlessness. I am floating, no, soaring, above the landscape of my mind's own invention.

I fly over a vast, seemingly infinite ocean, the water sparkling and shimmering with the reflection of a million stars. The darkness of the sky gives way to a brilliant aurora borealis, ribbons of vibrant color swirling and twirling in the inky sky. I hover in the air, free from the gravitational pull that had once tethered me to the earth. And I am giddy with the joy of this newfound freedom.

I journey on, over rolling hills and verdant forests, over mighty rivers and serene mountain lakes. Until at last, I reach my destination. It is a magnificent palace, with towers that seem to pierce the sky and walls of the shiniest marble, flecked with gold. I enter and find myself in a grand, opulent hall, bathed in the warm glow of a thousand candles. At the far end of the hall, a great door stands before me.

This is the moment. The moment I have been waiting for. I have labored long and hard toward this goal, and now, at long last, I will learn if my efforts have been in vain or if I have indeed achieved the success I have striven for. But as I approach the door, it remains closed, impenetrable, a silent sentinel guarding the knowledge I so desperately seek. I am filled with a sudden sense of despair, the weight of my ambition heavy upon my shoulders.

But no! I will not give in, I will not surrender to the darkness that threatens to consume me. For I am a fighter, a dreamer. I have not journeyed this far, fought this hard, to be turned away at the last. I marshal my strength, my will, and I throw open the door, bathed in a blinding light.

And then, I am awake. I can feel the truth glittering at the edge of my consciousness, as ephemeral as the remnants of my dream. But I know, deep within, that I have been successful. I have done what I set out to do. I have conquered my fears, and achieved my greatest ambition. My dreams have become my reality.
