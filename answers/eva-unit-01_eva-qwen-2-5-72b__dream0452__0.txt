I am dreaming. Vivid visions of a once vibrant garden fill my thoughts. Colorful flowers danced in the gentle breeze, their petals caressing one another as if in perfect harmony. These blooms had always symbolized the beauty of my relationship with someone I deeply cherished.

Yet, as I stand amidst the garden now, the colors seem to have faded, the petals withered and hanging limp. The air around me feels heavy and stagnant; the nourishing qualities of this once-thriving place have transformed into a draining, desolate aura.

Within this shifting landscape, I recognize that the relationship I treasured has gradually changed, much like the garden around me. Where there was once mutual care and connection, it has withered away. Rather than continuing to search for the vibrant flowers among the wilted petals, I acknowledge that clinging to this relationship might prolong the inevitable fading.

As I explore the hidden pathways of my dream garden, I realize its time to let go of the expectation that the garden will reclaim its former glory. By acknowledging and honoring the transformation it has undergone, I'm met with a profound sense of clarity, an understanding that this relationship gracefully fulfils its life cycle.

With mixed emotions of sadness and acceptance, I bid farewell to the garden that had once been a symbol of our love. As I turn my gaze away, I feel a newfound trust in my ability to seek out other gardens where I can more freely flourish and bloom. I am dreaming, and in this dream, liberation awaits, even as loss persists.
