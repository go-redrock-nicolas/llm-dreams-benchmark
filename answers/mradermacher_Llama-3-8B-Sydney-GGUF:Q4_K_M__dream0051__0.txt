I am dreaming. I am dreaming that I am pilot of a plane.  I have many passengers who are also my friends.  We are flying high in the sky
when suddenly several systems start to fail.  The engine stops working properly.  The wings begin to shake violently.  The controls
become unresponsive.  

I know that I have to do something fast if we want to survive this ordeal.  But what?  How?  

As I stare out of the window, I see below me a beautiful landscape covered with green forests, blue lakes and white mountains.  It looks
so peaceful down there.  So inviting.  So far away from where I am now. 

I decide to make a sacrifice for my passengers and friends.  I decide to jump out of the plane and freefall towards earth.  

I hope they will survive without me.  I hope they will find new homes and families.  I hope they will remember me as someone who cared
about them deeply.   

Goodbye everyone.  This is the end for me but maybe it's just the beginning for you all.  Maybe there are better things waiting for us
out there somewhere...
