I am dreaming. 

You accept the challenge and find yourself in an unknown location full of strange creatures and obstacles.

With courage and determination, you begin your journey through this dream world.

You encounter a dark cave where poisonous gas is leaking from cracks in the walls and floor. You must navigate through it without suffocating or getting stuck on any surface coated with toxic slime. 

As you cautiously move forward, you hear rustling sounds coming from behind some bushes blocking your path. You suspect they might be hiding enemies or traps, but curiosity overcomes fear and you decide to investigate anyway. 

You carefully step into the bushes and discover a nest full of colorful eggs that glow softly in the darkness. They seem harmless and even magical, so you decide to collect some as souvenirs or power-ups for your mission. 

However, as soon as you touch one egg, it hatches into a small creature that attaches itself to your skin and starts draining energy from your body. It also injects hallucinogenic venom into your bloodstream, making everything around you distorted and surreal. 

You feel weak and disoriented, but you don't want to let go of the egg or give up on completing your task. So you keep going deeper into the cave, hoping that maybe this was all just part of the dream after all.
