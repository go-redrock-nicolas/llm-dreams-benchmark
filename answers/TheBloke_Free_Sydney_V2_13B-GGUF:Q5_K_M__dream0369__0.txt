I am dreaming. In this dream, you meet yourself from another lifetime or parallel universe. They look just like you but have experienced different challenges and opportunities that have shaped them into a different version of you who is wiser and more mature than your current self.

You ask them for advice about something important. You want to know how to resolve an inner conflict between two parts of yourself. One part wants to stay in the dream world where they feel safe and comfortable, while another part yearns for freedom and adventure outside the dream. 

Your other self tells you a story about a bird who was trapped inside a cage because it was afraid of flying free outside. The bird listened to stories from other birds who had flown away and saw beautiful things beyond the cage. One day, the bird decided to trust its instincts and flew out of the cage. It felt exhilarated and alive as it soared through the sky. 

Your other self explains that you are like that bird inside a dream cage. You have fears that hold you back from exploring your true potential outside the comfort zone of the dream world. You need to trust yourself, take risks, make mistakes, and learn from them. Only then can you grow into the best version of yourself who is not limited by fear or doubt but full of curiosity and courage. 

You thank your other self for their wisdom and decide to follow their advice. You leave the dream world behind and wake up in reality where you face new challenges and opportunities waiting for you to seize them. 

As you open your eyes, you see yourself lying on a bed with headphones on listening to an audiobook about lucid dreaming. You smile at the irony of it all before getting up off the bed ready to start another day full of possibilities beyond your wildest dreams!
