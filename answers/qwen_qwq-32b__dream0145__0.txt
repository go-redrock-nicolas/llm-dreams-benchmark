I am dreaming. I have been through so much in this dream, there was a labyrinth made of living coral that pulsed with bioluminescent light, each step making the walls hum a mournful song. The walls here are twisting and shimmering as if alive. I tried to navigate, but every corner led me back to a dead end. Each failure made me more desperate. I remember falling into a sky filled with paper cranes that turned into ash when I tried to grasp them, and the ash formed into a raven that hissed insults. Then there was the desert of whispering sands where my footsteps were immediately erased by an unseen wind. 

But now I'm facing this... this colossal monolith that radiates an oppressive weight. It’s not just a stone wall, more like a living thing made of shadow and iridescent black glass. There are eyes embedded in its surface, slitted like a serpent’s, but glowing with a cold starlight. They follow me as I circle it, searching for a weakness. The air thrums with a low frequency vibration, making my bones ache. 

When I touch the surface, it feels like pressing my palm against a black hole. A voice booms in my mind—not mine—not another’s. It's the monolith, asking me to prove my worth in a language of emotions rather than words. Fear, courage, grief, hope—all are laid bare. It’s like standing naked in a tempest of feeling. 

I think back to moments that defined my journey: the time I found a single blooming flower in the ashen desert and whispered to it, vowing to protect it; when I surrendered to the coral labyrinth’s song and let it guide me past an obstacle; the moment I tore the raven’s paper body to see a tiny, folded origami heart inside beating faintly. Those memories surge through me, a kaleidoscope of raw emotion. 

The monolith shudders. Cracks spiderweb from each eye. Light bleeds through the fractures—golden and warm, like sunlight through a prism. The shadows recoil. The voice softens, becoming a chorus of whispers in every language. *You have loved despite desolation,* it murmurs. *You have hope when hope was a delusion.*

The monolith fragments into billions of tiny prisms, each one a crystallized memory of every being that ever faced such a test. They swirl around me, painting the void with flickering colors. A bridge forms, iridescent and humming, leading into a storm of stardust. The air smells of jasmine and ozone. Lights converge into a single point ahead—destination unknown, but the weight in my chest is gone. I run toward it, my footsteps leaving Behind glowing prints that bloom into flowers as they hit the ground. 

The end? Perhaps. But in the dream’s grammar, the comma gleams.
