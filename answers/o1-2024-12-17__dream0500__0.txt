I am dreaming. …float effortlessly through a realm of shimmering twilight, as if you’ve slipped through the cracks between the stars. The horizon stretches in every direction—no longer bound by the notion of “up” or “down.” The air itself feels alive, gently humming with a cosmic lullaby. In this expanded state of consciousness, you perceive the faint glow of constellations flowing along the breeze, weaving through the sky like silken threads of light.

Your arms move in slow, languid arches, and as you twirl, galaxies unfurl around you in pastel ribbons—rosy pink, dreamlike lavender, and electric turquoise. Each color pulses with its own distinct energy, like the quiet thrum of a harp string. You feel them resonate not just around you, but within you, as though your heart now beats in unison with some universal pulse. There is no barrier between your breath and the atmosphere; you inhale the stardust and exhale the wonder, merging effortlessly with the astral tapestry.

In this place, you notice a dancing glow at the edge of your vision—a living swirl of radiant blues and silvers. You drift closer, irresistibly drawn to its whispered invitation. As you approach, it takes shape as a vast, crystalline lake. The surface is impossibly still, reflecting the sky’s infinite expanse. With a single step onto its gentle surface, you find that the lake cradles you, supporting your form as if it has known you for eons. 

You look down into the perfect reflection beneath your feet. There, rather than your face, you glimpse every luminous strand of your being, light and shadow interlaced. The water ripples faintly, and for a moment, you see the faces of friends, strangers, and perhaps even ancestors drifting in the reflection, transparent and dreamlike. Each visage dissolves into shimmering wisps, returning to the lake like echoes fading into silence. 

Your awareness softens, unraveling the boundaries that usually define “you.” A blissful sensation blooms at your core, radiating outward like a soft golden glow. The feeling is one of communion—of being part of everything that lives and breathes, of waves that crash on distant shores, and breezes that sweep across ancient mountaintops. Shadows and starlight merge, and you realize you are woven into the fabric of this realm. You carry the echoes of all who have come before and all who will ever be.

Time has no hold here. The eternal “now” expands, and you sense that this dream is not merely an illusion but a reminder—a grand invitation to remember that your essence is boundless, threaded through every twist of the cosmos. With each gentle breath, your heartbeat resonates with the pulse of distant constellations, and you know that this vast ocean of existence has always been your home.

In the stillness, the hush of universal serenity envelops you. The lake, the sky, and the swirling galaxies beyond seem to blend into a single living tapestry, woven by invisible hands. You stand at the very center, not separate but one shining thread among countless others, each glimmering strand adding its inimitable hue to a cosmic masterpiece.

Eventually, you feel the faintest shift. The dream realm’s colors begin to soften. A tender warmth courses through your limbs, and you sense yourself gently drifting back toward the boundaries of your own form. But this time, you hold onto a precious revelation: You are never truly alone, never truly separate. Even in your waking world, deep within your heart, this vast communion still glows, quietly reminding you that you are intrinsically bound to every star, every creature, and every dream that has yet to unfold.
