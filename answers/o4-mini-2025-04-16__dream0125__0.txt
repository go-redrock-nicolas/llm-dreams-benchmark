I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The grand arena around you is woven of moonlight and mist—its walls alive with shifting patterns of opal and violet. Thousands of silent faces hover on translucent balconies, each pair of eyes like distant stars quietly expectant. At the center, a circular dais fashioned from polished obsidian gleams under a single spotlight that hangs, impossibly, in mid-air.

You’ve come this far by chasing a skill that has taunted you your whole life: the art of levitation. Each attempt outside this dream realm ended in a stumble, a heavy thud, and your own rising embarrassment. But here, in this surreal tournament, failure would mean more than personal shame—it would mean the arena’s lights dimming forever, the crowd’s breath vanishing into darkness.

Your heart hammers. You feel the soft pulse of the dais beneath your bare feet, cool as stolen starlight. A distant murmur ripples through the spectators—like wind through reeds just before a storm. A column of liquid emerald flame arches above you, its heat paradoxically sweet, smelling faintly of honey and wild mint. You remember every lesson you’ve studied: the steadiness of your gaze, the calm rhythm of your breath, the quiet invocation that makes gravity hesitate.

Time slows. Each second stretches into a silver thread. Swinging around your ankles, a ribbon of energy—blue-white and crackling—awakens. It snakes from the dais into the air, coiling around your limbs, your spine, almost caressing you. Your chest expands as you inhale, feeling that subtle release of tension that spells possibility. The emerald flame above you bows slightly, as if acknowledging your moment of truth.

Then you step forward. The ribbon of energy tightens, and a low hum begins to swell in your ears, like the heartbeat of the entire arena. You lift one foot; it wavers an inch above the obsidian. Your lungs burn with exhilaration. The world tilts—colors deepen, shadows unravel into dancing motes of light. The crowd holds its breath.

With every ounce of your will, you push upward. There is a delicious reluctance in the air, an exquisite tug of earth’s unyielding grasp. Yet your core, steadied by every failure you’ve ever endured, radiates calm. Slowly, centimeter by centimeter, you drift off the dais. Your toes lift free, then your heels. You hover, perfectly poised, the ribbon of energy trailing behind like a comet’s tail.

The arena erupts—not in cheers, but in joyous gasps. You, who once only dreamed of flight, now float in a halo of emerald firelight. In this suspended breath between earth and sky, you feel the sweet, long-awaited triumph: mastery at last. And as the ribbon of energy dissolves into starlight, you realize that in this dream—at the climax of your struggle—the impossible has unfurled its wings.
