I am dreaming. I am walking down a market street in an animated, enriched world, filled with music and laughter, marinated chickens on fire grills, glowing purple LED light bars alongside the wooden tables. I stop beside a falafel maker, a man in a turquoise shirt, wearing a paper hat, both hands occupied with making the dough, mixing the spices. “Best falafel in town,” he tells me, “put in some extra cumin, extra garlic, and paprika, too, if you want me to.” His eyes twinkle and the spices glow like crystals against the grey powder. He opens the dough pouch, pours some extra cumin in it, his hands forming an even juggling motion.
