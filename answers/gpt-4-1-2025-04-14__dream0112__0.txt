I am dreaming. The air thrums with tension as I stride across a colossal platform suspended in an endless cathedral of clouds. The floor beneath me is a latticework of gleaming metal beams—silver and iridescent blue—stretching in every direction, vanishing into a haze of golden light that makes distances deceptive, uncertain. Every sound ricochets in this sky-borne world: the sharp tap of my boots, the electric whirr of laser measures, the tense murmur of my team’s voices. All around, engineers float on antigravity harnesses, their high-tech tablet screens glowing with holographic blueprints splayed across space.

I glance at the plans projected in midair: a bridge to nowhere but vital, every bolt and beam a lifeline. My own heartbeat syncs with the flashes of warning lights—red, then green, then red again—as sensors detect the faintest misalignments. Down below, veiled by clouds, I sense a pulsing city full of people who don’t know how closely their fates entwine with ours.

Suddenly, I notice a subtle dip in the structure—barely perceptible, like the hush before a storm. My team, worn by endless hours, begins to work faster, hands trembling, surrendering to temptation: a shortcut here, an estimate there. A welder skips a recalibration; a surveyor dismisses a decimal, voices masking unease with forced bravado.

A cold dread creeps into my veins. I conjure a vision of the bridge failing—a yawning chasm splitting apart, echoes of shouts swallowed by cloud and steel. Unseen lives are at risk with every careless gesture. 

I raise my voice, magnified and resonant across the skyship’s scaffolding. With a flick of my wrist, the plans loom large above us, glowing with error alerts. I conjure memories of those whose lives we hold in our hands, my words weaving urgency and purpose through the fog of fatigue. “This is more than numbers and lines. It’s a heartbeat held together by trust and skill. If we falter by mere millimeters, we inherit a ghost town below.”

Silence follows—a breathless pause before, one by one, my team recommits, eyes brightening with renewed focus, measuring tape and scanner wands recalibrated with obsessive care. I watch precision return, inch by inch, like sunlight dissolving the last shadows beneath the clouds. The structure steadies, every new beam set with mathematical certainty, and I realize the future—fragile and glorious—has been rebuilt by hands that refused to settle for almost and minds awake even in dreams.
