I am dreaming. ——












I am dreaming. 

The wind smells of burnt cinnamon and shattered porcelain as I step over a buckling asphalt river. Each crack in the ground exhales whispers—half-remembered arguments from kitchens that no longer exist, a neighbor's wind chime melody reduced to tinnitus. My shadow stretches twenty arms across the ruins, distorted by hovering spheres of mercury that quiver like jellyfish stranded in time. There, where the post office once stood, a birch tree grows instantaneously through a car's rusted carcass, bark swirling with neon Cyrillic letters spelling out every apology I never uttered. 

Cold stabs my palm—I'm clutching a doorknob that shouldn't survive, its brass roses now blooming lichen-green fur. When it clicks open, the sound becomes a flutter of origami moths escaping into a sky crowded with inverted skyscrapers. Their glass facades drip upwards, defying gravity like frozen fountains, and inside their floating rooms I see silhouettes drinking tea from broken cups. My shoes dissolve into liquid silver, footprints pooling into a trail that leads to a mound of wedding dresses calcified into coral. Air molecules vibrate with cello notes from my mother's unfinished symphony, each bass tremor resurrecting a shard of stained glass until the cathedral of my childhood materializes—transparent and humming, its rose window pulsing like a jellyfish's bioluminescent heart. 

Rain begins falling sideways. The droplets contain miniature supernovas.
