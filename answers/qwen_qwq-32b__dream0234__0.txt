I am dreaming. The air around me feels alive, humming with a low, resonant frequency that seems to pulse in time with my heartbeat. I realize the source is the very ground beneath my feetâ€”a symphony of sound rising from roots and soil. My fingers brush against a leaf, and suddenly, visions flood my mind: images of sunlight filtering through canopies, rain cascading in slow motion, and memories of wildfires that scarred the earth centuries ago. The plants speak in a language woven from sensation and color, requiring me to feel their words rather than hear them. I understand. I finally understand.
