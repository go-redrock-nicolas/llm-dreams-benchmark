I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a midnight-glimmering lake whose waters ripple with every breath you take. Moonlight, liquid silver, spills across your shoulders like a shawl, and the air is rich with the scent of wet moss and distant jasmine. Across the lake stands a great willow—a friend whose branches once offered you cool refuge, whose sap once fed your roots. But now its limbs have grown heavy, coiling around you like ivy that won’t let go. You feel its weight in your chest.

Honoring this evolving relational reality, you reach out a hand and let warm light pool in your palm. With each exhale, tendrils of golden glow wind up the willow’s trunk. The vines loosen. The sap withdraws. Where there was clinging, the bark softens, crumbling into dust that drifts off like a sigh. You do not hack or sever—only invite transformation. The willow bows, releasing its burdens into your luminous grip. That weight you once carried now dissolves, turning into a fine mist that rises to rejoin the sky.

As the mists swirl upward in spirals of pale blue and rose, the lake’s surface smooths to a glassy mirror. In its depths, you glimpse your own reflection—steady, unbound, eyes alight with newly freed possibility. From the far shore, a corridor of glowing lanterns arcs through misty gardens. You step onto a wooden causeway, each plank humming softly beneath your feet, each lantern guiding you toward a hidden orchard where succulent fruits hang like lanterns themselves—promise incarnate. 

With every footstep, your heart expands. Leaves overhead unfurl in delicate lace patterns, letting through shafts of dawn that taste of renewal. You carry with you only the lessons harvested from that once-binding willow: compassion for its honored place in your growth, and gratitude that you now move forward unmoored. As you walk deeper into the orchard’s embrace, a gentle warmth blooms in your chest, and you realize the dream itself is your companion—and in waking, you will carry its light with you.
