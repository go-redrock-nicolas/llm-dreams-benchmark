I am dreaming. The air is thick and golden like honey laced with sunlight, dripping with the scent of forgotten memories—earthy, warm, and tinged with the echo of childhood laughter. I drift through a vast open field, though I’m not sure if my feet are touching the ground. The sky above me ripples like a body of water, reflecting a world that doesn’t quite exist, yet feels truer than anything I’ve ever known.

In this strange place, my thoughts are tangible. They swirl in the air around me like moths drawn to a flame—soft, insistent, whispering truths I already know but rarely choose to heed.

And then, like a shadow slipping through a crack in my mind, the pattern begins again. The familiar rhythm of bad decisions, worn into my subconscious like a riverbed carved by time, gently pulls at me.

I see myself walking backward through the moments of my life—a conflict I avoided instead of resolving, a chance I let slip into silence, love I refused out of habit more than reason. Those memories form a path beneath my feet now: cracked mirror tiles reflecting not just what was, but what could have been.

But in the dream, something important shifts. Awareness sparks like lightning in my chest. I see the rhythm for what it is: a loop of self-sabotage dressed like intuition. Like watching a snake swallow its own tail, I begin to understand that I am both the serpent and the illusion.

The moment I recognize the pattern, the world around me ripples. The honeyed air turns to silvery mist, and I find myself standing at the edge of a vast ocean made of liquid thought. Every ripple is a memory. Every wave a possibility. If I step in, I know—I will drown in the old self I created. If I walk along the shore, I may escape again, unchanged but aware.

And so I do the only thing that can break the dream—the only thing that can change anything.

I choose to dive.

The second I plunge into that ocean of my own mind, I don’t sink. I dissolve. My senses scatter like birds. I no longer know where I end and the world begins. But instead of fear, there’s clarity. I disintegrate into the pattern itself, and only then do I see: I was never trapped by it. I was feeding it with belief, with repetition, with reluctance to feel the pain of change.

The wave breaks me open.

I wake gasping, my heart a drum, my skin on fire—not from terror, but from awakening.

And though the dream is gone, its truth clings to me like dawnlight after a long night. The pattern still exists. But now, so does my ability to see it. To reject it. To choose instead a new path, forged not by comfort or habit, but by conscious love.

The dream, it seems, was just the beginning.
