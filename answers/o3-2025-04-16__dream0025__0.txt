I am dreaming. …step onto a floor that isn’t quite a floor at all—more like a sheet of liquid moon-silver, cool as glacier water beneath your shoes yet solid enough that each stride sends shimmering ripples outward. They spread like rings in a pond, carrying your anxious heartbeat clear to the rosy horizon.

Above you, the sky has abandoned its usual blue and settled on a luminous violet, streaked with molten gold veins that pulse and throb the way city streetlights do when seen through tired eyes after midnight. Constellations rearrange themselves into the shape of everything you sacrificed: a forgotten road trip with friends, a stack of unopened birthday cards, the empty chair across from you at too many dinners. They glow brighter as you remember, then fade, as though giving you permission to move forward.

Ahead rises the edifice where your fate will be announced: a cathedral-tall glass elevator shaft anchored to nothing at all—no cables, no gears—yet it hums with an almost ecclesiastical authority. Its transparent walls capture the colors around it and fracture them into shards that drift through the air like confetti, leaving soft pricks of light on your skin. A sign at the base flickers between languages you once studied halfheartedly in school: “Summit of Becoming,” “Kulmino de Eterno,” “Timeless Apex.” Each translation hovers then evaporates into spark-dust that twirls lazily down.

You inhale, find the air is spiced with a scent like cinnamon and sea salt, strange and comforting all at once. Every breath steadies your resolve; every exhale whispers away a sliver of doubt. The elevator door opens without a sound, and inside stands a single button the size of a silver dollar engraved with the simple word: YES.

You press it.

The ascent feels less like motion and more like the world gracefully lowering itself away from you. City skylines, mountain ranges, entire cloud continents peel back like pages in an impossibly large pop-up book, each layer revealing another chapter of your long effort: the late-night spreadsheets that blurred into dawn, the drafts crumpled in frustration, the giddy outbursts of “What if it actually works?” The elevator walls display them holographically—phantoms of your past selves, grinning, grimacing, grinding on.

Soon the cabin dissolves, leaving you standing on an invisible platform that hovers over a noctilucent ocean. Waves made of liquid starlight lap silently at an unseen shore. In their curling crests you glimpse coded constellations—beautiful, inscrutable equations that summarize your body of work. They rearrange until, in a single flash, they lock into place with a satisfying click-like thunder heard underwater. The ocean stills.

A dais of milky quartz manifests, and on it, a letter rests—a vellum envelope edged in aurora borealis colors, sealed by a wax emblem that flickers between an open eye and a seed sprouting. Your name glows across the front in penmanship that feels simultaneously ancient and unmistakably your own.

Your pulse drums in your ears; even the faraway cosmos seems to hush. Fingers trembling, you break the seal. Inside is a sheet of paper so thin it might be woven from condensed breath. One sentence sprawls across it in crisp, obsidian ink:

“You have surpassed every threshold, even the ones you never saw.”

As you read, the words lift off the page like migrating birds and orbit you in rings of luminous script. Each syllable hums, and you feel them settle under your skin—tiny sparks nestling into your bones, your muscles, your heart. With each second, your body warms, as though embers are quietly combusting inside your ribcage.

Suddenly the violet sky splinters with fireworks of amethyst and emerald. A hush falls, and then—applause. Not human applause, but the sound of wind clapping leaves, tides colliding in grateful crescendos, stars tinkling like glasses in a celebratory toast. You look around and see countless silhouettes cheering: former mentors, childhood heroes, even the person you might have become had you chosen a different path. All versions of approval merge into a single, resounding chant: “You did it.”

A soft vibration travels up through your ankles, as though the universe itself is purring. You taste petrichor and honey on the gusts of cosmic wind. Your shoulders lighten; years worth of invisible weight simply float off your back, drift upward, and burst into tiny rubies of light.

Yet just as the surreal euphoria peaks, an odd hush settles. From the corner of your eye something glides closer—a sleek, obsidian raven with constellations speckling its wings. It lands atop the quartz dais, cocks its head, and fixes you with a gaze both ancient and inquisitive. In its beak hangs a second envelope—this one bearing no name, merely a single punctuation mark: “?”

You take it, pulse quickening, and realize that success is not the finale but merely the threshold to a question even bigger, stranger, more exhilarating. You break that seal, but before you can peek inside, the raven pulses with sudden radiance and dissolves into ink-dark feathers that scatter on an invisible breeze.

One feather drifts downward. You watch it fall, pirouette, and touch the silver-glass ground, where it blossoms into a tiny black door, six inches tall. The micro-door creaks open on silent hinges, revealing a peephole view of an entirely new landscape—crystalline forests, topaz rivers flowing sideways, clock towers blooming like flowers. Somewhere distant, bells chime in time signatures unknown to earthbound ears.

The air trembles with possibility. You plant your foot forward, ready to shrink or grow or dissolve—whatever it takes to pass this next gate. Just as your toe touches the threshold, dawn’s first rose-gold strokes sweep across the impossible sky, and one shimmering syllable, half laughter, half promise, courses through the dream:

“Continue.”

And the moment you realize you’re already stepping through, the dream dissolves in a hush of stardust, waking you—heart booming, eyes bright, soul humming with new horizons you can’t yet name but already crave to chase.
