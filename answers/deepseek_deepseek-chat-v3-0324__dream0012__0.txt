I am dreaming. The deck of the ship beneath my boots bucks violently as waves, the size of obsidian mountains, rise and crash around me. The sky is a churning cauldron of bruised purples and sulfurous yellows, split intermittently by jagged forks of lightning that illuminate the chaos like the flicker of a dying lantern. The air is thick with the metallic scent of ozone and the saltspray that lashes at my face, sharp as broken glass.

The crew—shadowy figures with wide, fearful eyes—cling to ropes and rigging, their shouts swallowed by the roar of the storm. They look to me, their captain, for salvation. In that moment, I feel the weight of their trust—the very pulse of their collective fear—beating in time with the wild rhythm of the sea. 

But then, something shifts. 

A strange quiet settles over me, though the storm still rages. It's as if I've been plunged underwater, everything muffled but for the slow, deliberate thud of my own heart. 

Against the horizon, where the sky should meet the sea, the waves begin to part. Not in retreat, but in reverence. The water splits like a curtain drawn back, revealing a figure emerging from the depths. A woman—no, something more—ascends from the blackness, her form shimmering with bioluminescent light, her hair a living current of silver and seafoam. Her eyes are twin abysses, holding galaxies within their depths. The Leviathan Queen.

She lifts a hand, and the storm stills at her command. The crew gasps, but I cannot look away. She speaks, not with words, but with the resonance of a thousand submerged chimes. 

*"You are lost, little captain. But I shall guide you home."* 

And then the dream twists like a tangled net. The ship is gone, the crew dissolved into mist. I am floating, suspended between ocean and sky, as the Leviathan Queen reaches out—not to save me, but to pull me deeper into the unknown. Her fingers brush my cheek, cold as the abyss, and the world dissolves into velvet darkness.

But just before waking, I hear her whisper, *"The tides dream too."* 

And then—I surface, gasping.
