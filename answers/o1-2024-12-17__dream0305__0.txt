I am dreaming. …find yourself drifting upon a translucent lake that glows with an otherworldly luminescence, the water’s surface so smooth it mirrors the sky. High above, instead of the moon, you see a colossal pearl floating among teardrops of starlight—crystalline orbs that sparkle in synchronized patterns, almost as if they are breathing in tandem with you.

A gentle breeze rustles the tall reeds at the lake’s perimeter, making them chime like a distant wind orchestra. You glide toward the shore, each stroke of your dreamlike paddling sending soft ripples of turquoise and gold across this radiant lake. The air smells of fresh pine and jasmine, evoking both nostalgia and enchantment.

Unable to stay silent, you step closer. In this moment, the tranquility of the lakeside collides with your moral conviction. The distant chorus of the wind-sung reeds seems to whisper for you to protect what is precious. Your pulse quickens, for you sense a choice forming. Will you confront this harm with fiery outrage, commanding the violator to stop at once? Or will you approach them with steadied compassion, hoping to change their course through dialogue and understanding? The starlit silence is charged with possibilities.
