I am dreaming. **Dream Journal: The Garden of Embers**  

You are dreaming.  

At first, there is only silence—a velvet hush, as if the world has been muffled beneath a heavy blanket. Then, slowly, the darkness parts like a theater curtain, revealing an endless garden under a bruised twilight sky. The air smells of wet earth and burnt sugar, thick with an unspoken tension.  

Tall black roses grow here, their petals edged in glowing crimson, like embers clinging to charred paper. Each one trembles, not from wind, but from something deeper, something stifled. You realize, with a jolt, that these are not flowers at all. They are your angers—every one you’ve ever swallowed, every frustration buried alive.  

One blooms before you, its stem shuddering. It pulses with a slow, dangerous light. You reach out—hesitant—and the moment your fingers brush a petal, the garden exhales.  

A voice, neither yours nor a stranger’s, hums through the roots beneath your feet: *"You kept us in the dark so long."*  

Suddenly, the rose ignites. Not in destruction, but in transformation—flames curl into the shape of a hand, then a wrist, then a figure stepping free from the blossom. Your anger stands before you, not as a monster, but as something vital. A being forged of fire and shadow, its eyes twin coals, its voice a low, resonant crackle.  

"Watch," it says.  

The scene shifts. You’re a child again, small and trembling, biting your tongue as a grown-up’s voice towers over you. The memory is hazy, but the heat in your chest is not. The figure of your anger steps forward and—gently—takes the child’s hand. "You don’t have to hold this alone," it murmurs.  

The garden reacts. Some roses wilt, their fire dimming into soft gold light. Others burn brighter, shaping themselves into tools: a sword wrapped in vines, a lantern with a flame that doesn’t scorch.  

Your anger turns to you. "I am not your enemy. I am the part of you that says *no* when boundaries are crossed. That howls when justice is undone. Let me breathe, and I will not burn you—I will warm you."  

As you exhale, the sky lightens. Dawn, or something like it, bleeds into the horizon. The garden is still there, but it’s different now. Alive. Yours.  

And when you wake, your fists are unclenched.
