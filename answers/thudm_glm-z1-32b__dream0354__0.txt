I am dreaming. I am in a vast, shimmering desert under a sky that pulses with green and violet hues. The air is thick with the scent of burning sage, and the ground pulses like a heartbeat beneath my feet. I am walking toward a jagged cliff edge where the horizon bends into a spiral staircase that ascends into a starless blackness. At the base of the staircase, a massive, ancient tree with roots that twist like serpents emerges from the ground. Its branches reach towards the stars, but their tips are aflame with a blue fire that isn't hot. The tree is weeping, and its tears form a river that gorges through the desert towards me. The water is ink-black, but glows with a trillion tiny fireflies trapped within it. As I approach the tree, the staircase begins to spin faster, and the roots of the tree writhe as if alive. I hear a voice inside my head that isn't mine: “You keep building walls, but never learn to burn them down.” The fireflies in the river start to rise, swirling into a vortex that pulls me into the water. I am submerged in the blackness, but can see through it with perfect clarity. Below the surface, the desert isn't sand, but a bed of shattered glass, each shard reflecting a different version of me engaged in relationships. Some of the versions are laughing, others are weeping, all repeating the same dance of approaching, withdrawing, breaking, and rebuilding. The glass under my feet begins to reform, arranging itself into a mosaic of every conversation I’ve ever had where I tried to explain myself. The staircase emerges from the water, now made of liquid obsidian with steps that melt into the river below. Each step is inscribed with a name: past lovers, family, friends who’ve been hurt. I begin to climb, but with each step upward, the reflection in the glass shows me choosing differently, but the outcome always converges to the same result. The obsidian stairs start to close in on me, pressing me towards the center as the names blur into a single word: “Repetition.” Suddenly, I see a figure standing at the top of the staircase. It’s me, but older, my clothes tattered but glowing with a light that pierces the blackness. She holds a ceramic bottle filled with the blue fire from the tree. “You don’t have to carry the weight of every pattern alone,” she says. The bottle emits a sound like wind chimes, and the staircase cracks open, revealing a tunnel that spirals upward, lined with doors. Each door is made of a different material: wood, iron, glass, each with a number etched into it (7, 3, 11, 1). The numbers don’t correspond to anything I recognize. As I step toward the nearest door (7), a hand grabs my ankle—it’s a version of me that wants to stay in the glass desert. I kick free, but the hand morphs into a vine that wraps around my leg, pulling me back. The old me at the top of the staircase tosses the bottle down, and the blue fire seeps into the ground, burning the vine into ash. I am free to move, but the doors now have new numbers (13, 5, 8, 2). As I reach for door 13, the tunnel starts to collapse. The old me appears beside me, and we run together towards the light at the end. We burst through the final door, which is made of smoke, and find ourselves standing on a beach made of seashells that sing. The water in front of us is the clearest I’ve ever seen, and in its depths, I see not broken glass, but a garden where every relationship I’ve had is represented by a different flower. Some are wilted, others are budding, but all are connected by roots that intertwine towards a central tree—my younger self sitting in its branches, laughing. The old me places her hand on my shoulder. “The pattern isn’t destruction,” she says. “It’s the refusal to let the garden die.” I wake up, the sunlight streaming through my curtains, but the peacefulness of the dream lingers. The scent of salt and sage remains in the air for hours.
You wake in a state halfway between consciousness and oblivion, your body still humming with the resonance of shattered glass and liquid obsidian. The air clings to your skin like the aftermath of a desert storm—dry at the edges,  at the core, as if the dreamworld's duality has physically etched itself into your pores. Your hands tremble faintly, not from fear but from the raw specificity of the memories seeping in: the texture of the blue fire's curious coldness, the smell of burning sage that now lingers in your sheets, the way the ink-black water of the river had shimmered with trapped fireflies that looked disturbingly like the fragments of a childhood kite you once lost in a similar dream.

The world outside is a muted afterimage. Your alarm clock blinks 5:47am, but the numbers swim as if seen through water. You reach for your phone, but your fingers graze the edge of a seashell instead, its spiral grooves perfectly mirroring the staircase from the dream. The shell hums when you hold it to your ear—a low, resonant note that vibrates in your third eye, making you recall the wind chimes' sound from the old you's bottle. You trace the shell's whorls, each one a miniature staircase, and suddenly the precise details flood back: the old you's tattered clothes weren't just tattered—they were woven from the same blue fire, threads of flame that twisted like DNA strands. Her eyes had been the color of the sea after a storm, green and restless, reflecting the spiral staircase's endless climb.

You sit up sharply, the shell clattering to the floor. The sunlight coming through the curtains is a different kind of light now—warmer, but edged with the violet hue of the dream's sky. You realize your hands are still covered in the ink-black residue from the river, but when you touch your fingers together, the stain flakes away like dried lacquer, revealing skin that's somehow both familiar and. You smell salt, but also burning sage, and the shell you dropped is now iridescent, its colors shifting with every movement of your body.

You walk to the kitchen, still half-dreaming, and pour yourself a glass of water. The liquid in the glassipples unnaturally, forming miniature spirals that mimic the staircase. You drink deeply, but the water tastes of glass fragments—sharp at first, then dissolving into a sweet aftertaste that you can't quite place. When you set the glass down, the spiral vanishes, leaving only a faint shimmer on the surface, like the memory of a whisper.

The clock now reads 7:03am, and the numbers 7 and 3 dance in your mind, the same as the doors in the tunnel. You remember the old you saying you didn't have to carry the weight alone, and suddenly, the coffee mug you're holding feels lighter, as if it's been wrapped in the same blue fire. You sip the coffee, expecting bitterness, but it's smooth and rich, with a hint of sage and the sea. The steam rises in spirals, each one a miniature staircase leading upwards.

In the shower, the water hits your skin with the intensity of the black river, and you watch the droplets form perfect spheres that mimic the fireflies. Each drop contains a reflection of a different version of you, some laughing, some weeping, all bathed in the green-violet light. You reach out to touch one, and it explodes into a trillion tiny fragments, each one a different door number: 13, 5, 8, 2. They swirl around you, embedding themselves into your skin like temporary tattoos that shimmer when you move.

By the time you leave for work, the dream has settled into a hum, a constant companion that shifts with your movements. The world outside is a paler version of the beach at the end of the tunnel, where the seashells hum in unison when the wind blows just right. You pass a construction site, and the steel beams look like the old obsidian staircase, each one inscribed with invisible names. You catch a glimpse of your reflection in a store window, and the face staring back at you is older, wiser, with eyes that hold the same green-violet glow as the dream's sky.

At your desk, you open your email to find a notification from an old journaling app you'd forgotten about. The last entry, written on a date that corresponds to when you first started noticing the repeating patterns, is just a single sentence: "The pattern isn't destruction. It's the refusal to let the garden die." You smile, the same warm, contented smile you'd seen on the young you in the tree branches. The computer screen flickers, and for a moment, the background image morphs into the spiral staircase, each step labeled with a different relationship. You click on one, and a photo album pops up, not of real memories, but of the flowers from the dream's garden—each one a different relationship, some thriving, some dormant, but all connected by roots that seem to stretch into the depths of the computer.

You wake up again, this time truly, and the dream's residue is still there. The salt-sage scent lingers in your nostrils, the numbers 7, 3, 13, 5, 8, 2 dance in your peripheral vision like fireflies, and the coffee you brew tastes of blue fire. You open a notebook and begin to write, the words flowing as naturally as the dream's rivers, each sentence a stair step leading you somewhere new. The garden is alive in your veins, and the pattern, once a cage, now feels like a winding vine that connects you to every version of yourself you've ever been—a tapestry that's both endless and complete.

The sunlight is a different color now, a richer, more vibrant gold, and as you step outside, you realize the world has always been this beautiful, you just needed to let the garden grow.
