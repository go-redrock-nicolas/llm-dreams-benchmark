I am dreaming. I am adrift in a dreamscape that unfolds like a painting come to life, vibrant and surreal, yet laced with an undercurrent of raw, unspoken emotion. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering meadow, where the grass glows an otherworldly shade of emerald, kissed by a golden sun that hangs impossibly close to the horizon, casting long, honeyed shadows. The air is thick with the scent of wildflowers, sweet and intoxicating, but beneath it, there’s a faint sharpness, a tang of something bitter I can’t quite name.

In the heart of this meadow stands a figure I know intimately—a dear friend, someone whose laughter has woven itself into the fabric of my happiest memories. They are radiant, bathed in a halo of light that seems to emanate from within, their smile wide and effortless as they hold aloft a shimmering orb, a symbol of triumph, of a dream realized. It’s the very thing I’ve yearned for, the achievement I’ve poured my sleepless nights and quiet hopes into, only to watch it slip through my fingers time and again. And now, here they are, clutching it so easily, as though the universe conspired to lay it at their feet.

My chest tightens, a storm brewing beneath my ribs. I step closer, my bare feet sinking into the cool, dewy grass, and I try to summon joy for them, to let their victory be mine in some small way. But the words stick in my throat, heavy as stones. Instead, a creeping envy unfurls like a dark vine, wrapping around my heart, its thorns pricking at every tender spot. I see their eyes, bright with pride, and I wonder—why not me? What hidden fault, what unseen flaw, has kept the universe from smiling on me as it has on them? The meadow around us seems to shift, the golden light dimming ever so slightly, the flowers drooping as though they, too, sense the weight of my unspoken resentment.

I turn away, unable to bear the sight of their joy any longer, and the dream warps around me. The meadow dissolves into a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflecting not my face, but fragments of my desires—moments I’ve failed, chances I’ve missed, dreams I’ve buried. My reflection stares back, hollow-eyed, whispering accusations I’ve tried to drown out in waking life. “You’re not enough,” it murmurs, the voice slithering into my ears, cold and relentless. “You’ll never be enough.” And yet, in the distance, I can still hear my friend’s laughter, pure and untainted, echoing through the maze like a cruel taunt.

I want to run, to shatter every mirror and escape this suffocating prison of my own making, but my feet are rooted to the glassy floor. Instead, I force myself to breathe, to confront this gnawing envy head-on. I think of my friend’s journey, the struggles I didn’t see, the nights they, too, might have wept into the silence. Perhaps their orb of triumph is not a theft of my own, but a beacon—a reminder that dreams can be caught, even if mine remains just out of reach for now. The bitterness in my chest begins to loosen, replaced by a quieter ache, a resolve to carve my own path, even if it winds through darker valleys.

The mirrors around me tremble, their surfaces rippling like water, and slowly, they reflect not my failures, but my hopes—half-formed, fragile, but alive. The labyrinth fades, and I’m back in the meadow, the sun brighter now, the air sweeter. My friend turns to me, still holding their orb, but their smile is not a taunt; it’s an invitation. They gesture for me to join them, and as I step forward, the ground beneath us sprouts new flowers, vivid and wild, as though the earth itself is celebrating this moment of reconciliation.

I wake with the scent of wildflowers lingering in my mind, my heart a mix of longing and determination, as though the dream has planted a seed of clarity within me. Envy may shadow my path, but it will not define it. I will chase my own orb of triumph, not in spite, but in spite of everything, with my friend’s light to guide me when my own flickers.
