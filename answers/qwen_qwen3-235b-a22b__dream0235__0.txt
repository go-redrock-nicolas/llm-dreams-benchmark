I am dreaming. The air is saturated with secrets and the sky pulses like a living heart. I float between sensations and sights—an invisible observer and yet intimately present. Below, a city unfolds in spirals, built upon itself like the rungs of a dream-ladder stretching into the molten dawn. The buildings shimmer subtly, not with light, but with emotion. Some seem to wink with quiet joy while others sag mournfully under the weight of centuries-old grief.

I am descending—although I never truly touch the ground. Beneath my invisibility is the feeling of water sliding over stone, of breath stirring the air. I land, soft as a feather, into the world of the **Motionspeakers**.

There is no sound.

There is no voice.

But every living being **moves** with undeniable intention.

Their gestures are the language of the soul laid bare. When a man sighs, he does so by allowing his torso to bend like a willow in the wind, fingertips grazing the fringe of sorrow. When a woman is startled, her arms spiral out in precise arcs, like a flock of starlings shocked into motion.

This is a world unshackled from sound, where the unsayable becomes an intricate ballet.

I step forward, unnoticed, and feel my soul syncopate with theirs, thudding in rhythm with their art. My heart begins to learn this silent syntax, disentangling the grammar of the unuttered. A flick of the wrist may be gratitude. A perfect stillness can be thundering resentment. When two people intertwine in a duet of shared elation, their movements becoming so syncopated they seem like mirrored vines twisting around a tree of joy, it is breathtaking.

No words here. Only the *dance of truth*.

I watch as a boy confesses unrequited love—not with a trembling confession, but with a routine so achingly slow and delicate, it brings the trees nearby to lean closer, as if they too ache to interrupt.

A woman grieves for a lost child through a ceremony of tears enacted in motion—at midnight, on a glassy lake. She jumps and flips through the air, her limbs drawing constellations in the ether, her descent punctuated by feather-light landings that ripple like silent heartbeats across the waters.

And I, too, am compelled. I do not speak, but I begin to **remember how to move.**

At first rough, hesitant—like a long-buried limb stretching for the first time in years. But then: I dance a memory of sorrow, and the crowd around me shivers and folds into a respectful circle of stillness. I wave out a greeting the next day, my arms swooping low and rising high like the flight of a lone tern over open sea, and the small girl who watches me bows deeply and bubbles into a gesture of pure delight.

Here, my lies cannot hide. My anger cannot slither under plausible deniability. My joy cannot be contained. Every part of me is **read like choreography carved in the stars.**

And in this world of truth, I find healing.

I am still in the dream.

But for the first time, I am utterly, gloriously known. Not through my voice, but through the slow unfurling of my soul in motion.  

And as the sun of this rolling dreamworld begins to rise in spirals, outlining the golden arches of a city that lives by motion, I realize I do not want to wake up.  

I want to stay here, inside this marbled cathedral of movement and medicine, where the world speaks through gesture, and the heart dances without words.
