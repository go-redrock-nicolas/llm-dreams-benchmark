I am dreaming. The air around me shimmers with an electric iridescence, like the inside of a prism caught in moonlight. I stand not on solid ground but on a floating island of soft, woven clouds, each thread thick with memory—laughter, hesitation, echoes of voices long silenced. Tendrils of mist curl around my ankles, whispering fragments of forgotten names and unrealized dreams. Above, a sky of liquid sapphire swirls with constellations that pulse like living hearts. I am dreaming, and this is no ordinary place—it is the Conclave of Echoes, where souls gather to speak their truths and be heard.

Around me, a great circle of beings has formed. They are not human, not entirely. Some shimmer in forms half-realized—shifting between eagle-eyed elders and scholars made of ink and paper. Others are shimmering constructs of light and code, beings of pure intention, born from the convergence of magic and machine. Every shape, every form, represents a perspective, a worldview, a universe of experience. They are gathered to shape the future of a reality they all share but understand differently.

But the harmony I wished for is fraying.

A voice booms like thunder across the circle, shaking the cloud beneath our feet. It belongs to a being clad in armor made of unchallenged assumptions, whose presence distorts the light around it, making others dimmer by comparison. He speaks with the force of centuries, pointing with a staff of silver logic toward the ancient script that binds this world. He speaks of order, efficiency, history. His words are brilliant, but like a flood—they leave no room for others to breathe.

Across from him, a figure huddles in the shadows, barely visible. She is small, draped in robes woven from forgotten dialects and soft-spoken proverbs. Her voice is like a breeze you almost miss, easily drowned in the raucous hum of dominance. Her truth is ancestral, rooted in silence turned sacred. She sees the cracks in the efficient systems the thunderous one praises, knows how the cold logic forgets warmth, empathy, the rhythm of life’s fragility. But she does not speak, for the sky trembles every time the boom-voiced one rises.

I feel the imbalance pulling the very circle apart.

And so I raise my hand, fingers glowing with threads of light I pull from the sky like strands of cosmic silk. I form a barrier between the thunder and the breeze—a wall not of rejection, but of reflection. I create space, a breathing cone of sapphire flame in the center of the Conclave.

I speak gently, as gently as the breeze, and as firmly as the roots of mountains:

> “Let this flame burn only for those who are heard too seldom.”

The thunder ceases—for now. The articulate warriors hush. The machines pause their soft whirring. All eyes turn inward toward the flame.

I gesture to the quiet one in the ancestral robes.

“The Conclave listens,” I say, wrapping my voice in light so it carries, not as a force, but as an invitation. “Your silence has shaped the world more than you know. Speak now, and let it take form.”

She looks up, eyes vast with galaxies. Her voice rises like water bubbling from a hidden spring. At first, it’s almost imperceptible, but the flame listens—it catches her voice, amplifies it not with volume, but with presence. Her words unfold into shapes, into images of earth broken by highways of progress, of plants forgotten in labs brimming with synthetic cures, of small hands passing knowledge not in books but in seeds, in song, in silence understood.

And as she speaks, others stir. A group who had been waiting on the edges with folded wings begin to flutter them gently. A being constructed from molten copper and a billion invisible minds opens his chest and lets forth voices we’ve censored in pursuit of efficiency.

I weave the space between us alive with interconnection, symbolized by luminous vines that curl from one speaker to another, forming a living web where all threads connect.

As the dreamscape pulses and transforms, I feel tears not of sadness, but of recognition. The Conclave is real now—alive—because each voice, however soft, however loud, has been given breath and space to create. 

And in that space, diversity is not simply welcomed; it is the architecture of everything that comes next.
