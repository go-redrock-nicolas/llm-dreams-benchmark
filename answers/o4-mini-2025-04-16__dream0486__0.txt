I am dreaming. You are drifting through a forest that glows from within—every leaf pulsates like a tiny lantern, every branch hums with invisible currents of life. The ground beneath your bare feet feels like soft moss woven from starlight and morning dew. With each step, ripples of emerald light spread outward, carrying your heartbeat into the roots of ancient oaks that tower above you. Their canopies form a cathedral of lacy shadows, and you sense that every flicker of leaf and tendril of vine is attuned to your presence, responding in silent song.

A slow wind rises, and you lift your face to meet it. It tastes of honeyed blossoms and distant rain, curling around your hair and clothes like a living embrace. Somewhere overhead, a swarm of small, silver-winged moths takes flight in unison, tracing spirals of shimmering powder across the twilight sky. You close your eyes and breathe deeply, and the vibration of wings resonates through your chest—an unspoken message of kinship, as if the forest itself is whispering, “We breathe as one.”

You wander toward a river whose waters glow with liquid gold. When your fingers touch the surface, ripples spread like the chords of a welcome, and you feel memories of every creature that has ever drunk from this stream—otter cubs paddling at dawn, deer pausing for a sip at dusk, salmon surging upriver in blind determination. In that moment, you recognize the river’s entire history as part of yourself, and yourself as part of its unbroken flow. You lean down and scoop the warm, luminescent water to your lips, tasting the echo of a thousand moons.

On the opposite bank, a circle of stones rises out of the earth like sleeping giants. As you approach, each stone pulses—first a soft green glow, then shifting through sapphire, amber, and rose—until the entire ring is alive with color. Stepping inside, you feel a low, harmonious vibration beneath your feet, a resonance that seems to originate from the heart of the planet. You stand in the center and close your eyes; in the hush that follows, you hear a symphony of subtler sounds—the slow drip of sap, the sigh of wood expanding in warmth, the distant rumble of roots reaching ever deeper.

Then a single note rings out, clear and pure, like the voice of a crystal bell. It expands into a chorus of tones so rich you can taste them—caramel earth, salty spray, tang of pine resin. Every sense merges; taste becomes sound, sight becomes scent. You are not merely a visitor here but a living thread woven into the tapestry of all things green and growing. In this moment, you understand without thought that your breath is the forest’s breath, your pulse the heartbeat of all sap and cell. And as you open your eyes, the stones’ glow fades to a gentle ember light, and the forest exhales around you in a sigh of welcome and farewell, sending you back toward waking with the secret knowledge that you will always carry this communion in the quiet of your own blood.
