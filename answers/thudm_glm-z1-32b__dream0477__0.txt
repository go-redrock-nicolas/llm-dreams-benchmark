I am dreaming. I am beginning to notice patterns connecting seemingly unrelated events in my life. Following these synchronicities, I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, whispering forest with bioluminescent trees that shift colors like stained glass under a prismatic sky. The air hums with a resonant frequency, and every step I take alters the landscape around me—fallen leaves rearrange into constellations, rivers bend to mirror my thoughts, and shadows grow lighter as I breathe. In the distance, a tower made of stacked, interlocking fragments of my memories rises, its spire piercing the clouds. Each fragment contains a memory, a choice, a regret, all glowing with a soft, pulsing light. As I walk toward it, the forest floor blooms with flowers that sing fragments of songs I’ve never heard but feel deeply familiar. A flock of spectral birds with translucent wings shaped like keys circles above me, their cries translating into phrases from different languages I understand instinctively. Reaching the tower, I discover the door is made of liquid mercury that parts smoothly as I press a handprint into its surface. Inside, the walls are etched with constellations that map the connections between major moments in my life—my first love, a childhood injury, a career decision, all linked by tendrils of golden light. At the center, a crystal orb floats, its facets reflecting infinite versions of me, each representing a possible future. I touch it, and for a moment, I am everywhere and nowhere, experiencing all these lives simultaneously until I wake, drenched in sweat, with the taste of copper and honey on my tongue.
