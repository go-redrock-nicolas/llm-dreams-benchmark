I am dreaming. The air hums with a dense, velvet stillness, like the breath of an ancient library holding too many secrets. You sit in a circle on cold obsidian benches that ripple faintly, as though carved from liquid shadow. The others’ faces flicker between familiarity and strangeness—their features blur like smoke whenever you try to focus. A guardian figure stands at the center, antlers twined with bioluminescent vines, holding a lockbox. It pulses faintly, like a heart wrapped in silver filigree. "Offer something true," they intone, voice echoing as if spoken through water, "or the roots will ask for more."  

Your palms grow damp as the lockbox levitates toward you. The others’ half-visible eyes glint with curiosity, their mouths stitched shut by masks of moth wings. You sense the room shifting—walls dissolving into fractal patterns, floor undulating like a black ocean. A disembodied whisper coils around your ear: *"What do you bury that the earth wants back?"*  

Hesitation knots your throat. But then, the box snaps open on its own. Inside swirls a nebula of iridescent threads—each a memory, a fear, a desire you’ve armor-plated. To touch one would unravel it entirely. The group leans in, their silhouettes elongating into spindly, hungry shadows.  

Suddenly, your breath becomes visible—golden vapor that forms symbols in the air: a diary page burned at fifteen, the unspoken apology to a faded friend, the childhood nickname that still pricks like a thorn. The shadows recoil, hissing. The guardian’s antlers bloom into white-hot flames. "Enough," they murmur, and the lockbox seals shut, its contents dissolving into ash that smells of rain and rust.  

You wake as the floor gives way, falling not into darkness, but into a sky thick with winged keys, all singing the same bittersweet note. The dream dissolves, but the aftertaste lingers: vulnerability, it seems, can be a kind of alchemy.
