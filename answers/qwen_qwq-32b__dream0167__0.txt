I am dreaming. I am walking through an endless library, the air heavy with the scent of aged parchment. Shadows twist on the walls like living things. My boots click rhythmically on the parquet floor, each step echoing in the silence. Every book here is a memoir; every shelf a repository of memories. I pause before a towering tome bound in obsidian. It opens with a sigh, revealing pages that shimmer like liquid mercury.

The text reconfigures before my eyes, narrating a memory not my own. I see a knight in rusted armor kneeling in a field of blood-red poppies, whispering apologies to a dying dragon whose scales are crusted with centuries-old battlefield soil. The dragon’s wings, once vast enough to blot out the sun, now slump like tattered sails. A single, crystalline tear falls from its eye, impaling the knight where he kneels—a mercy-kill woven into legend.

When the vision fades, I realize the tome is blank again. The library seems slightly warmer now, as if the knight’s regret heated the air centuries ago. I know there are countless such tales—stories that shape wars, that fuel empires—hidden between these shelves. My mission isn’t to read them all… but to find the one story that can bridge chasms of hatred deeper than oceans.
