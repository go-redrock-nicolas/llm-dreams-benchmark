I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The floor beneath your feet isn’t solid earth but a living mosaic of glowing tiles, each one humming with its own secret melody. Above you, a vaulted sky ripples like oil on water, shifting from deep violet to molten gold as you breathe in the cool, metallic air. Around you, ten strangers sit in a perfect circle on floating cushions of spun glass—each cushion transparent, so you can glimpse your own trembling reflection from beneath. They wear masks of neutral expression, but their eyes glint with expectation.  

A soft chime echoes through the chamber, and a kindly voice through the vaulted sky invites you to share something deeply personal—“a truth that only your heart knows.” Instantly, the tiles beneath your feet flicker, and the room tightens. You feel the weight of a thousand unspoken questions pressing on your chest. Your pulse echoes in your ears like a drum. The circle leans forward. You taste copper on your tongue.  

You reach into your coat pocket and find a small, heart-shaped lantern, warm to the touch. Inside it glows a flickering blue flame—your most guarded memory. To share it would be to open the lantern and let that flame dance in everyone’s eyes. Silence stretches, and the lantern begins to expand, its light pulsing with every heartbeat. The strangers watch, transfixed. The room’s walls, now mirrors, begin to ripple with the scenes of your past: childhood laughter in a dusty attic, tears on a hospital pillow, whispers of comfort in the night.  

Your breath catches. You sense the fragile edges of your vulnerability fracturing the dreamscape. But then, as if guided by some deeper self, you tuck the lantern back into your coat. The circle still waits, but you realize that your truth need not be handed over like a gift to be judged. The floating cushions drift away on a gentle current of luminescence. The mirrored walls dissolve into clouds of violet smoke.  

In that moment, you understand: some stories are yours alone to carry. As the dream sky pulses one last violet note, you step off the mosaic floor and rise—untethered, holding your lantern close—into the infinite deep of your own imagination. And then you wake.
