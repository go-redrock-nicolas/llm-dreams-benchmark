I am dreaming. I am standing in the center of an open field, the crisp breeze rustling through the tender blades of grass that swirl around my ankles. Off in the distance, I see my life - years of memories, relationships, experiences, and each treasured object - strewn about like confetti on the wind. Slowly, some of that confetti dances closer, settling softly around my feet. But the rest drifts higher, lifted on the warm currents of air, vanishing from sight.
