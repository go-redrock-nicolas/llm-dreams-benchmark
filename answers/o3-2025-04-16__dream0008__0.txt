I am dreaming. …I blink, and the office quivers like a mirage.

Fluorescent lights overhead hum at a fever-pitch, then melt into milky stalactites that drip time itself—silver droplets that splatter on my desk and fizz away with tiny clock-hand sparks. Cubicles stretch and telescope outward like accordion corridors, filing cabinets rustling their drawers like restless birds folding steel wings.

My boss looms at the threshold of this rubber-band reality, but she is no longer a person of flesh and nerves. She is a silhouette made entirely of sticky notes: neon pink for urgency, lemon yellow for warnings, electric lime for all the “ASAP”s she’s ever barked. Her eyes are twin red exclamation marks, pulsing.

“Deadline: sundown,” the sticky-note silhouette intones, voice rustling like paper against paper. She hands me a manila folder swollen with blank pages. Each sheet feels warm, as though it’s inhaling my hesitation and exhaling dread.

I glance at the wall clock—only to realize it has no hands. Instead, a shoal of koi fish glide in slow circles behind the glass face, their scales shimmering with minutes and hours that refuse to be caught.

Panic pricks at my ribs. I crack open the folder and see words crawling across the pages on centipede legs, rearranging themselves faster than I can read. An entire report is trying to write itself and devour itself at the same time. Every time I grab a line, the letters scatter like startled ants.

My computer keyboard sprouts roots and flowers, keys blossoming into ivory petals marked with glyphs of unknown alphabets. I tap the spacebar: a gust of lavender-scented wind billows out, scattering bales of digital hay across the screen, where tiny pixelated farmers begin threshing data like wheat.

“Not fast enough,” my boss murmurs in her papery rustle.

Desks around me suddenly lift from the carpet, buoyed upward by helium balloons filled with corporate buzzwords: “Synergy,” “Optimization,” “Pivot.” Each balloon squeaks its mantra whenever it brushes the ceiling tiles. Coworkers ride those levitating desks in slow-motion, surfing spreadsheets that curl and crash like turquoise waves.

I stand, determined to anchor reality. A stapler becomes a chrome beetle in my palm; I fling it open like a switchblade and slam it onto the paperwork. SNAP. Each staple pins the wriggling sentences for a heartbeat before they stretch, liquify, and slither free again.

In desperation, I reach into my desk drawer—and find an ancient hourglass of black-sand time. The sand hisses when it falls, whispering secrets in languages older than deadlines. I flip it over, and every grain freezes mid-air. Suddenly the whole office steadies, colors sharpening, geometry returning… but only for one held breath.

The moment I release the hourglass, time whiplashes forward. My boss begins multiplying—two, four, eight sticky-note facsimiles surrounding me with a cyclone of Post-It orders. Their exclamation-mark eyes flash red strobe lights. Around them, the koi inside the wall clock burst through the glass, swimming in the open air. They loop around my head, shedding glittering scales that burst into instant to-do lists.

I climb onto my chair to escape the swirling fish-paper storm, then leap onto my desk, which bends into a trampoline and catapults me skyward. The ceiling cracks open, revealing a velvet cosmos pinpricked with glowing bullet points. Every star is a task I have yet to finish; constellations connect into flowcharts that stretch across infinity.

Far below, the balloon-borne cubicles dwindle to dots. In the gravity-less hush of space, I finally understand: this project’s deadline is impossible because it has no edges. It is everything I have never done, folded into one urgent second.

Yet above me, just out of reach, spins a silver moon shaped like a “Submit” button. It thrums with quiet promise: Complete me, and you will wake.

I push off a satellite that looks suspiciously like a giant coffee mug. With each breaststroke through stardust, unfinished ideas unspool behind me like comet tails. I grab the moon.

Click.

A colossal chord reverberates, the sound of every office bell chiming at once. Light floods from the moon-button, pours through my fingers, becomes a tidal wave of pure completion, washing over the cosmos, dissolving tasks, muting alarms.

I fall—slowly, gently—through layers of aurora-colored spreadsheets that flutter like silk banners, descending back toward my desk. The office is quiet again, almost ordinary. My boss stands in front of me, reduced to a single yellow sticky note stuck to my monitor. It reads, in tidy black ink: “Well done. Deadline met.”

Relief flows through me like cool water. I blink once more—

—and wake, heart pounding, hands empty, monitor pristine. The only evidence: a faint scent of lavender in the air and, on the carpet by my chair, a single shimmering koi scale.
