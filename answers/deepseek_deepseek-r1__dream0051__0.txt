I am dreaming. In the shimmering twilight of the dream sky, the cockpit’s controls flicker like constellations going dark one by one. The horizon tilts drunkenly as alarms blare in a dissonant symphony—hydraulics failing, engines sputtering like dying beasts. Your hands, gloved in shadow, dance across the panels, each switch and dial dissolving into smoke when touched. Outside, the clouds unravel into liquid silver, pooling on the windshield, obscuring the earth below. A voice crackles through the static, not from the radio but from the air itself, whispering in a language of wind and fractured glass. 

Passengers’ faces flicker in the cabin mirrors—some wide-eyed, some serene, their features melting like wax. The yoke trembles in your grip, now fused to your palms, veins threading steel. Through the haze, a mountain emerges, not of rock but of mirrors, each reflecting a different catastrophe: fire, ice, freefall. Yet the air tastes of lavender and iron, calm and metallic. A single red switch glows beneath your thumb, pulsing like a heartbeat. You press it. The plane dissolves into a flock of starlings, scattering into a sky now violet and endless, each wingbeat a note in a song you’ve known since before you were born. The ground, when it rises to meet you, is not ground at all but a sea of hands, uplifted, waiting.
