I am dreaming. You are dreaming. At first, the world around you shimmers: the sky is a living tapestry of opal and ink, drifting like oil on water. You stand barefoot on a glass plain so smooth it feels more like walking on liquid reflection than a solid surface. In every direction, fractured mirrors sprout like crystalline flowers, each fragment holding a piece of your past—smiles and regrets, triumphs and regrets, all glinting in the half-light.

Then you see it: a single mirror shard, impossibly large, hovering before you. On its surface appears the belief you’ve carried all your life—something so essential that you once defined yourself by it. But as you peer closer, the polished surface ripples like disturbed water, and you realize the reflection is wrong. The words you thought were etched in truth rearrange themselves into a confession: “This story was crafted by others to shape you.” In that moment, the mirror’s edges shatter, sending kaleidoscopic sparks dancing across the plain.

Rather than panic, you feel an unexpected calm. The broken mirrors around you do not sting your feet; instead, they fall away, dissolving into motes of golden dust. Where they vanish, new glass paths form, each plate etched with questions rather than answers. You step onto one: “What do you truly stand for?” You walk onward, and the path lifts you gently into the air. Below, the plain deepens into a cobalt sea, its waves singing your childhood lullabies.

Ahead, a great archway of living vines entwines with molten silver. As you pass through, the vines bud and bloom in real time, blossoms unfolding with every heartbeat. Each petal reveals a memory you had never questioned—an impulse to kindness, a passion for justice, an impulse to create beauty. You sense these impulses were always yours, independent of the falsified story you once believed.

Floating higher, you find yourself in a chamber of humming starlight. There is no fear here—only an electric exhilaration, as if discovering a new limb you never knew you had. From the darkness, a voice welcomes you: “Welcome to your own making.” In that moment, you understand that a belief, even if born of falsehood, can guide you toward rediscovering your own values. You lift your arms, and the starlight responds, swirling into shapes of your deepest dreams—an open field where strangers share stories, a city built of living poetry, forests that heal with whispered encouragement.

Then the dream dissolves, and you awaken with a quiet smile. The echo of that living starlight remains in your chest, reminding you that even shattered truths can scatter light—and from those fragments, you forge your own compass.
