I am dreaming. [The dream begins in a vast, twilight-lit library, its towering shelves stretching endlessly into a misty horizon. The air hums with the scent of aged parchment and ink, and the faint whispers of forgotten voices seem to rustle between the pages. My fingers graze the spines of books—some bound in cracked leather, others in shimmering, otherworldly materials that shift under my touch. Each title is written in a language I almost recognize, but the meaning slips away like smoke.  

A soft, golden light pulses from a distant aisle, drawing me forward. As I walk, the floor beneath me changes—cold marble gives way to warm grass, then to shifting sand, as though the library exists across all times and places at once. The books around me begin to murmur, their words spilling into the air like liquid silver, forming fleeting images: a child laughing under a foreign sky, an old man planting a seed in barren earth, a woman singing to the waves.  

Then, a voice—not from any book, but from the air itself—whispers, *"What do you seek?"*  

Before I can answer, the shelves part, revealing a mirror with no reflection. Instead of my face, it shows a winding path through a forest of black trees with luminous leaves. A figure stands at the edge of the path, their features blurred, but their presence pulls at me like gravity.  

I step through the mirror.  

The forest is alive with sound—whispers in the rustling leaves, distant chimes carried on the wind. The path glows faintly underfoot, pulsing like a heartbeat. The figure ahead moves, just out of reach, but I follow, drawn by an ache in my chest that I’ve carried for years without understanding.  

Then, the trees open into a clearing where a river of stars flows silently, its surface rippling with constellations I’ve never seen. The figure turns—finally—and for a fleeting moment, I see my own face, but older, wiser, eyes full of quiet fire. They reach out, and as our fingers touch, the river surges upward, swallowing me whole—  

—and I am everywhere and nowhere, drowning in light, understanding without words that the meaning I sought was never lost… only waiting for me to stop searching and begin *seeing.*  

Then, I wake.]
