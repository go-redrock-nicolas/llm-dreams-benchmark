I am dreaming. Let me describe to you the surreal realm I've floated into...\n\n

The air here hums with a low, silver frequency, vibrating through my pores like the purring of some colossal celestial engine I'm mostly contained within. My borrowed dream-body moves through a labyrinth of floating platforms, each one a slab of iridescent crystal that thrums underfoot. Hundreds—no, thousands—of workers in glistening, gelatinous suits glide past me, their faces obscured by visors that flicker alive with constellations when they focus up close. They handle tools that aren’t tools at all but rivers of liquid light, shaping raw materials that seem to upchuck from the void beneath my soles like half-formed memories taking on substance. 

The structure we're building is all angles and absence. It’s notched into the very fabric of spacetime itself, a skeletal framework of prismatic beams that cast fractal shadows across my skin. Each beam bears a glowing glyph in a language I seem to forget every time I blink. My job? To ensure every junction aligns with the cosmic resonance map etched into my pupils. The tiniest discrepancy—a vibration too sharp, a wavelength out of phase—and this colossus of light and physics would collapse like a dying star, dragging any technician nearby into non-Euclidian geometries that unravel their proteins into existential static. 

A team’s laughter drowns out the harmonic tone. 

I pivot toward the sound. Three technicians nearby are hacking shortcuts, their light-rivers slopping over the project’s blueprint. They’re snipping a trio of anti-gravitic veins that should’ve been interlaced, not frayed. The air crackles as a beam above them flickers, its glyphs dimming to dimethyl ether ghosts. My veins turn to mercury as I realize—they’re cutting the struts that steady the structure’s upper lobe, the part that any moment now will begin siphoning a neutron star’s pulse to power the hyperlane engines. 

“Stop!” My voice fractures their levity, but one tech spins toward me, a grin splitting his face. His visor blazes with a nova’s fury as the glyphs above us combust into a kaleidoscope of catastrophic color. The beam fractures with a sound like a billion violins burning. 

Time splinters. I dive forward, dream-body contorting into impossible shapes to catch a plummeting worker, his gelatinous suit oozing through my fingers like hot wax. The platform tilts violently, platforms farther out detonating in silent supernovas as spacetime itself convulses. 

In that heartstop moment before the collapse, I feel it—the structure’s dissonance humming my name. The glyphs now scream in my skull, not as symbols but as equations I instinctively grasp. I grasp the floating light-rivers myself, their searing streams not harming but harmonizing into my hands like water finally learning gravity. 

*This is the true tool.* 

I weave a corrective lattice between the damaged nodes, my fingers trailing afterimages. The dissonant tone reverberates a chord, fractures sealing with a sound like a diamond being born. The workers’ shaky breaths return; the platform rights itself—just as my team, faces white, scrambles away. 

But then, they don’t look at me. They don’t look at anything. Their eyes dart sideways, deranged and dispossessed. Their gelatinous suits bulge grotesquely, irises blooming into mosaics of the glyphs they’d failed to honor. The air thickens, the silver humming now a dirge. Without another word, they leap into the abyss below, their screams swallowed by the quantum foam. 

I’m left alone, hovering above the abyss. My reflection in the molten reveals something shifting beneath my skin: the glyphs now migrated into my own eyes, throbbing in time with the structure’s heartbeat. I touch the space where my crew fell and feel it—a pull, a call. My body begins to dematerialize, fingers dissolving like sugar into the cosmic stream. 

To the structure. To join the thing we’ve built, to become part of its resonance. 

*To err is to disintegrate*, the dream whispers. A warning, maybe. A truth. 

Or perhaps, the first note of something divinely dangerous that we’ve only just begun.\n
