I am dreaming. The air hums with a velveteen static, thick and honeyed, wrapping around me like the breath of some unseen beast. The sky is a bruise—purple, black, seething at the edges with veins of molten gold, as though the heavens themselves are a living thing, wounded and pulsating. I stand at the threshold of a city that does not exist, its spires twisting like the ribs of a long-dead god, their shadows stretching impossibly, swallowing whole streets as they writhe.  

There are no people. Not really. Only shapes in the dark, murmuring syllables that dissolve like smoke before they reach my ears. Their faces are smooth, featureless, shifting—close enough to human to unsettle, but wrong in ways I cannot name. They move in slow motion, unaware or uncaring as I step through their midst, my fingers brushing against their forms, cold and yielding, like wet clay.  

I want something.  

The thought comes unbidden, a hunger gnawing at the hollow beneath my ribs. Not for food. Not for touch. Something deeper, nameless, a need so fierce it feels like a second heartbeat. The city obeys before I even speak, bending the very fabric of the dream to my will.  

A building—taller than the rest, its surface slick and glassy like polished bone—shudders as I approach. Its doors peel open like the petals of a carnivorous flower, and inside, golden light pulses in slow, rhythmic waves. There are whispers here, too, pleading, warning, but they mean nothing to me. The rules of waking life do not apply.  

I reach out. The walls tremble. The shadows recoil. Reality fractures like ice beneath my fingers, and I *take*—not with my hands, but with something deeper, something voracious. The structure collapses inward with a soundless scream, melting into liquid silver that pools at my feet. The faceless things outside freeze, turning their blank gazes toward me. But what do I care?  

The sky cracks open. Rain falls in shimmering black droplets that burn where they land, etching new pathways into the streets. The air tastes of ozone and blood. I walk through it all, untouched, a voyager in a world that cannot refuse me. If the dream cries out in protest, I do not hear it.  

And when I wake—if I ever do—I will remember none of it.  

Only the hunger, lingering.
