I am dreaming. I am participating in a religious ceremony from a tradition not my own. As I engage with these unfamiliar spiritual practices, I feel a profound sense of connection and transcendence. The ceremony takes place in a vast, ancient temple adorned with intricate carvings and symbols that spiral up its stone pillars like veins pulsing with ancestral wisdom. The air is thick with the scent of burning herbs and resins, their fragrant smoke twisting into shapes that seem to whisper secrets to the wind. A chorus of voices chants in a language I do not understand, yet each syllable resonates within me like a forgotten memory. 

My hands are placed upon a stone altar etched with constellations, and I am guided to pour a liquid offering that glows faintly, its hue shifting between gold and deep emerald like the pulse of a heartbeat. The liquid spreads across the altar, leaving trails that seem to reveal constellations I've never seen before, mapping paths through the cosmos that feel both alien and intuitively familiar. Around me, darkness begins to give way to light—strewn like stardust, it forms a celestial canopy above us. The flames of the ritual torches twist into serpentine forms, their tonguesof-fire licking at the edges of reality, dissolving the boundaries between the physical and the ethereal. 

A figure emerges from the haze, cloaked in a cloak woven from shadows and starlight. Its face is obscured, but I sense it is embodying the collective spirit of those who have walked this path before me. Its hands lift mine, and for a moment, our palms press together, and I feel a surge of energy that courses through my veins, connecting me to a lineage stretching through eons. The sound of the chant rises to a crescendo, and as it peaks, time seems to fracture. I am no longer in the temple—the air is replaced by the rush of cosmic winds as I am suspended between stars, each orb a window into a universe of its own. I am neither here nor there, but everywhere, and in that timeless instant, I understand that the boundaries of self are mere illusions, and the sacred is not a place, but a state of being.
