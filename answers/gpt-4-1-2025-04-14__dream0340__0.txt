I am dreaming.

In this strange and shimmering realm, I find myself in a city spun from translucent crystals and veils of cloud, where the streets ripple like silk and the air tastes of lilac and wintergreen. Shadows here walk on their own, trailing travelers like curious spirits. As I drift through this world, I encounter a figure unlike any I have ever known—a being shaped from fractal light and hurricane sound, limbs trailing ribbons of music, eyes reflecting impossible colors. This presence, neither human nor entirely unearthly, pulses with an energy so foreign that my mind aches just looking at them.

We try to speak, but our words dissolve into vapor. My tongue forms syllables; they vibrate without meaning. Their replies are symphonies—bursts of scent, color, and motion, blooming and collapsing in a heartbeat. Our perceptions skip in and out of phase, as if we stand not only in different realities but in different laws of physics altogether. Frustration churns within me, but curiosity is stronger.

Searching for common ground, I attempt to share a memory—a childhood moment with sunlight dappled through autumn leaves. I press this image into the space between us, hoping they will see. But they receive it as taste, as warmth, as a shivering thrum in the air—nothing like what I meant, yet something equally real. They respond by sending me a memory of their own, incomprehensible and dazzling: the sensation of being a gust of wind learning to sing, of existing as a thought before language existed.

Gradually, we begin to trade fragments: the feeling of standing in rain, the ache of longing, the weight of wonder. I draw pictures in the air; they weave melodies that ripple through the ground. We build a language of gestures, abstract shapes, shared silences, and layered memories—no longer attempting to translate, but simply to *witness* and *feel* each other’s realities.

In the end, communication does not become easy, but it becomes beautiful—a dance between differences, a celebration of the myriad ways being can express itself. As the dream deepens, I realize: sometimes the bridge between worlds is not understanding, but the willingness to cross the chasm, again and again, bearing the gift of one’s own mysterious self.
