I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of blooming starflowers—floral yet strangely metallic, as though the petals have kissed the surface of a distant moon. Above me, three suns writhe in a lavender-black sky, each one dancing to a different rhythm of time, casting overlapping shadows that slither like graphite serpents across the undulating ground. The horizon pulses faintly, like the gentle rise and fall of a slumbering giant’s chest.  

I am surrounded by beings of varying shapes and sizes, some floating, some slinking on six limbs, others appearing to phase in and out of the dreamscape like rippling reflections on water. Their voices do not emerge from mouths but from tiny resonating crystals nestled across their bodies, chiming like wind chimes in an unknown language that somehow unspools meaning inside my mind.  

I am attending what I can only assume is a gathering—a celebration, perhaps, or a communal rite of forgetting. I realize almost immediately that their culture navigates time in reverse. They speak of yesterday as tomorrow, name their children after the memories they have yet to make, and offer eulogies at birth. Every conversation begins as a farewell.  

One of the locals, a tall and translucent figure crowned with a halo of swirling ink, approaches me with incomprehensible grace. Its movements ripple the air itself, as if it were walking both in this dream-space and somewhere beneath the fabric of reality. Instinctively, I raise one hand in greeting, but I hesitate—I’ve just learned that here, direct eye contact indicates curiosity... and curiosity is considered offensive among these beings. Instead, I bow my head gently and reach toward the ground, where emotion is expressed through the brushing of textures beneath their feet.  

A soft thrill dances across my fingertips as they graze a patch of shimmering moss that shifts with feeling—plain gray when idle, pulsing crimson when touched with interest. I place my hand there, and the moss counters with a swirl of pale azure. Relief, perhaps. Or acknowledgment.  

The conversation unfolds not through words but through scent, sound, and the weaving of shadows. I listen as the locals share emotions like stories, each sentiment wrapped in a fragile melody that bends the air around it. I feel longing restrained by laughter, grief painted with wonder, joy edged with shadowy melancholy. Themes of identity shift like sand beneath my perception—their sense of self is fluid, shaped by collective experience rather than individual belief.  

Then, the sky begins to weep—except the rain falls upward, tiny shimmering spores released by airborne flora returning to their canopies. I catch one mid-flight. It blooms on my skin briefly, showing me not a vision, but a *feeling*: of what it was like to grow and dissolve, to merge and remember, to live unbounded by the chains of time or ego.  

As the dream stretches into its final moments, the sky pulses darker, and a soft singing rises from beneath the mountains. The gathering begins to dissolve—not depart, but simply fold inward, becoming less. I feel myself folding inward too, unraveling into mere thought, then thought of thought, until I awake with a lingering echo in my chest:  

That culture is not just where you fit—it is who you become when meaning dissolves the walls between you and the world.
