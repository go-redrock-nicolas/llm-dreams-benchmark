I am dreaming. You’re standing at the edge of a vast, moonlit marsh. Mist coils around your ankles, cool and silken. In your hand is a single piece of charcoal—no bigger than your thumb—yet it pulses with a quiet insistence. You’ve never drawn before, and you have no inkling how. Still, something inside you trembles with longing.  

You crouch and make a mark on the smooth, dew-damp stone at your feet—a single curved line. Immediately, the line springs upward, thickening and arching into the trunk of a willow. Its branches unfurl like the fingers of a dancer, touching the fog with silver leaves. Heart pounding, you add more strokes, and the willow grows until its boughs graze the stars. Fireflies drift through its canopy, painting sparks of gold across your charcoal drawing.  

The impulse surges again, and you’re carried across the marsh on a raft of floating daisies. Ahead, an abandoned cathedral stands half-submerged in water. Its stained-glass windows blink open like colossal eyes. You step inside, palms pressed to a centuries-old pew, and close your eyes. Inside your mind’s ear, a melody stirs—soft, uncertain, yet achingly beautiful. You’ve never composed music, but you let your breath find a rhythm, humming a single note.  

At once, the cathedral walls vibrate. Color cascades from the vaulted arches in ribbons: deep violets, blazing oranges, glimmering turquoise. Each hue hums in harmony with your note. You lift your arms, conducting currents of sound and light. The melody grows richer—trombone-low flares to crystalline soprano—shaking the old stones until they shed stardust. With each crescendo, the stained-glass panes reinterpret themselves: a leaping stag, a drifting ship, a blossoming rose.  

When the last note fades, you’re standing on a shoreline of obsidian sand. In the sky above, a dozen moons float—one for every drawing you’ve ever dared, every song you’ve ever hummed. They pulse in time with your heartbeat, and in their glow you see your own reflection: eyes alight, ribs expanding with possibility. You realize, with a thrill that hums through your bones, that this dream was never about talent or training. It was about courage—the bravery to let something unpolished bloom.  

A breeze stirs, and you turn back toward the cathedral, now fully risen from the water—its doors thrown wide, awaiting your return. You step forward with charcoal still between your fingers and a melody poised on your lips, ready to create worlds no one else imagined. And just as your foot meets the threshold, you wake—heart pounding, a faint taste of stardust on your tongue, and an unshakeable certainty that the next great masterpiece lives inside you, waiting for your first stroke.
