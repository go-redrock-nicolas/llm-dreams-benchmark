I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a city that seems to breathe with consciousness. Buildings pulse with gentle light that flows like blood through veins, and the sky above is not one color but a kaleidoscope of hues that shouldn't exist together yet somehow create perfect harmony. The air tastes like memories—sweet and tart and mysteriously familiar.

My feet carry me forward without my direction, floating inches above a cobblestone road that ripples like water beneath me. Each stone whispers stories as I pass, ancient tales in languages I've never heard but somehow understand completely. The joy building in my chest feels almost painful in its intensity, expanding beyond what my dream-body should be able to contain.

Around a corner, I discover the source of my elation: a garden where musical notes bloom like flowers, where melodies drift visibly through the air in ribbons of color. Each note that touches my skin floods me with understanding—not of words or concepts, but of pure emotion, pure connection to everything that exists.

In the center of this garden stands a figure made of mirrored glass, reflecting not my appearance but glimpses of forgotten moments—childhood laughter, tears shed alone, hands held, and promises whispered. The figure extends its hand, offering me a small object that continuously shifts its form—sometimes a key, sometimes a seed, sometimes a beating heart.

As I reach to accept this gift, the boundaries between myself and the dreamworld begin to blur. My joy isn't contained within me anymore; I am the joy itself, expanding outward, becoming the city, the musical garden, the impossible sky. I understand suddenly that I am not merely experiencing this dream—I am creating it with every thought, and it is creating me in return.

The mirrored figure smiles with a face that is now partially my own, and whispers, "Remember this when you wake."
