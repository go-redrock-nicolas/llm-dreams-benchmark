I am dreaming.

In this dream, I find myself in a vibrant market square bustling with activity. The air is thick with the aroma of exotic spices, freshly baked bread, and vibrant flowers. People from all walks of life move around me, their faces a tapestry of emotions and expressions I do not yet understand. The chatter is a cacophony of unfamiliar sounds, a symphony of foreign tongues I have never heard before.

A small, tattered notebook appears in my hand, and on its first page, an incomplete sentence in a language I recognize but am still struggling to comprehend.  You must learn….

Approaching the first person, I am filled with a mix of fear and curiosity. I clear my throat, my voice shaky as I try to form words. A kind, weathered face meets me with a warm smile, and without words, he reaches for a piece of parchment and sketches something familiar — a wagon, a horse, a house.

His hands move swiftly, drawing symbols I recognize but can't quite place. The wagon has two wheels, the house has a roof, and the horse has hooves. With gestures, he slowly spells out “HOUSE” in his language, while I hesitantly mimic his motion, pointing to the house and saying “casa.” A small cheer erupts from the gathered crowd, and I feel a surge of excitement. I have made my first connection.

I continue to move through the bustling market, each interaction bringing me closer to deciphering the complexities of this language. The notebooks continue to guide me; I practice words, repeat sentences, and gradually overcome my initial hesitation. Words like “bread,” “water,” and “friend” are strung together to form basic sentences.

Days turn into weeks, and my notebook becomes a testament to my progress. I learn how to ask for help, how to express gratitude, and how to barter. My sentences become more fluid, and my understanding deepens. The people around me, once strangers, now feel like companions on a shared journey.

In this dream state, I realize the beauty of language is not just in understanding others but in the way it bridges gaps, connects worlds, and brings communities together. Each new word learned, each phrase understood, feels like a thread weaving me more tightly into the fabric of this community, creating a vibrant tapestry of shared understanding
