I am dreaming. The city is melting.  The skyline is a waxy mess of towers sagging under the weight of their own importance.  Asphalt rivers flow where streets once did, carrying rubber ducklings that were once stoplights. Neon signs melt onto the ground like overripe fruit, leaving pools of liquid laughter that giggle when stepped in.  I run through this transformation, my shoes squelching in the sticky glow of dissolved streetlamps.  In the distance, a clock tower plays a concerto of wrong notes—the hands spin independently, each pursuing their own idea of time.  Somewhere, a piano made of clouds is played by wind, creating a symphony only dream moths can hear.  I grab a melting glockenspiel from a passing puddle, and strike a note that crystallizes the air for a moment. The stillness lasts until a flock of origami cranes, folded by forgotten wishes, dive into the now-solidified puddle, shattering the silence into a thousand prismatic shards of sound.  I wake, clutching a crescent mooncharm that hums with the remnants of the dream’s chaos.
