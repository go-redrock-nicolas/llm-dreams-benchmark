I am dreaming. You awake groggily, the sun streaming through your blinds in a strange orange hue. As your eyes adjust, a peculiar buzzing fills your ears, and you realize something is terribly different. You sit up, rubbing the sleep from your eyes, and suddenly remember - the rules of society have completely changed overnight. 

You stumble out of bed, your body propelled on autopilot, and make your way to the bathroom. As you splash cold water on your face, you catch sight of your reflection in the mirror. Your jaw drops open. Color. Everywhere. Vibrant, pulsating hues dance across your skin, swirling patterns cascading down your face and arms. This is impossible, but incredibly real. Color is forbidden, and yet here you are, a living canvas.

Stranger still, your mind seems to effortlessly process a torrent of new rules and regulations. One-word communications have become the norm - one-word responses, one-word opinions. Concise communication has replaced the art of conversation where sentences were once put sentences together. But here you are, trying very hard to follow along to the new rules in this surreal, technicolor world.

You step out, dressed in your usual clothes; now brown, beige and white, a stark contrast to the colors on your skin. Those mundane tones were always your vibes, once the signature of simplicity. But now, they symbolize uniformity, the suppressed norm. In this new world, individuality isn't just free, it's mandatory, it's the norm

Stepping outside, the air itself feels thicker, heavier, a weight you can taste. You make your way to the local shop, crowded with people engaged in the nearest activity under the blinding red sun. Color washes over you in quick streaks - yellows and purples, greens and blues, all intertwining over skin and surface. Random, intentional faces. 

As you approach the counter, the cashier eyes your palette, then yours questions. "Decided." is all Ze says, a neutral blanket of a statement that could mean anything. You feel strange, exotic. Ze writes your total - $100. Such a number. It seems absurd compared to what you usually spend.

With a surreal sense of compliance, you hand over the largest, smallest bill you have. Time is now divided into hours, minutes, seconds - each segment an eternal stretch. You've been tangled in a world where strangers hold hands. Meetings seem longer, conversations louder, neighbors closer.

As you walk home, the colors of the world seem to brighten, or maybe that's just your eyes adjusting. A man approaches you, his skin painted with a fractal pattern of red and blue. "Hi," he says, extending his arm. "Twin Peaks."

You stand there dumbfounded, struggling to process the new rules. It's okay, a voice seems to say in your mind. This is the norm now.

You shake your head, trying to clear it. Twin Peaks. You've never heard the phrase before, but somehow, it resonates deep within you. You grasp his arm, a jolt of electricity running through you at the contact. 

"I'm new here," you say, your voice sounding strange and foreign to your ears.

"I can tell," he replies, a smile playing on his lips. "Follow you. You'll get used to it."

And so you follow, your mind reeling. You don't know what awaits you, but one thing is certain:

This is the new norm, and it's a wild, colorful, and strange new world.
