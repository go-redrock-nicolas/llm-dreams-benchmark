I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, windswept valley at dusk, where the last rays of the sun paint the grasslands in molten gold and deep violet shadows. The air smells of wild sage and distant rain, and the earth hums beneath my feet with some ancient, resonant energy. A group of figures approaches—tall, willowy people wrapped in layers of shimmering, handwoven fabrics that ripple like liquid metals in the fading light. Their faces are adorned with intricate, luminous tattoos that shift patterns when they move, as if alive with stories.  

Their leader, a woman with piercing silver eyes, steps forward and presses a carved bone whistle into my palm. "You are one of us now," she murmurs, her voice like a whisper of the wind through reeds. "But to walk our path, you must learn to speak without words."  

Over the coming weeks, I am immersed in their world. They communicate through a mesmerizing blend of dance, flickering hand signals that cast shadow-pictures on the tents, and haunting melodies played on instruments made of glass and storm-worn wood. Every gesture holds layers of meaning—a twist of the wrist can convey grief, while the angle of a foot in the dust reveals kinship ties. Food is eaten in absolute silence, with flavors "discussed" after by arranging colored stones in patterns of approval or critique.  

The true test comes during the **Feast of Floating Lanterns**, when the tribe releases glowing orbs into the night sky, each containing a secret fear to be burned away. I must compose a confession without speech—only movement and sound. Heart pounding, I take the bone whistle and begin an improvised song, clumsy at first, then stronger as the tribe sways in rhythm around me. My feet trace circles in the earth, kicking up bioluminescent spores that rise like tiny stars.  

As the last note fades, the silver-eyed woman smiles and places her forehead against mine. The tattoos on her skin flare bright, and suddenly **I understand**—their language isn’t taught. It’s remembered. The whistle’s song was inside me all along.
