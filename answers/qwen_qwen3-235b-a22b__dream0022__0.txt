I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning lavender, and the sky pulses like a living thing—indigo veins crackling with gold lightning, as though the universe itself is holding its breath. You stand in a forest of glass trees, their crystalline leaves chiming in a wind that carries whispers of half-remembered lullabies. Between two jagged, shimmering trunks, your two closest friends—**Mara** and **Kael**—face each other, their shadows stretching into serpents and saints on the mirrored ground.  

Mara’s voice is a blade sheathed in ice. “You *promised*,” she hisses, her words dripping with the venom of betrayal. Her hair, usually a cascade of chestnut curls, now writhes like live wires, sparking embers that singe the air. “You said you’d never go back there. Not after what they did to us.”  

Kael’s hands tremble, but his eyes burn with a feral light. “You think I had a *choice*? They hold the *keys*, Mara! The ones to the doors we’ve been searching for our whole lives! You’d rather rot in this endless in-between than take a single step into the dark?” His voice cracks, and the ground beneath him splits, revealing a chasm that glows with molten constellations.  

The argument spirals—a tempest of accusations and fractured memories. You see flashes of their history: laughter around campfires in forgotten realms, hands clasped as they leapt through rifts in reality, tears mingled when they buried a third friend whose name now slips through your grasp like smoke. But now, their bond frays like old rope. The glass trees shudder, shedding shards that hover midair, glinting like frozen tears.  

Then, as if some unseen director has called for silence, they both turn to you.  

Mara’s gaze is a plea, her fury dissolving into something raw and desperate. Kael’s stare is a challenge, his jaw clenched, daring you to choose. Between them, a thread materializes—gossamer and glowing, stitched from starlight and shadow. It binds their wrists, taut and trembling, and you realize with a lurch of your gut that the thread is anchored to *you* too. A triad. A pact. A wound.  

“You,” Mara whispers, her voice breaking. “You remember what they took from us. You *have* to—”  

“Don’t,” Kael interrupts, his tone softening into something almost mournful. “Don’t let her guilt you into this. You know what’s at stake.”  

The thread pulls taut, searing your skin. The sky splits open, and a storm of black rain begins to fall, each drop hissing as it etches symbols into the glass earth—runes of loyalty, sacrifice, oblivion. The dream presses in, demanding an answer. Do you sever the thread to save their friendship, knowing one of them will be lost to the void? Do you follow Kael into the forbidden dark, or stand with Mara and guard the past at all costs?  

The choice thrums in your throat, but before you can speak, the glass beneath you cracks…  

And you wake, heart drumming, the echo of their voices still clawing at your ribs.
