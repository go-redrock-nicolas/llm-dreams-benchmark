I am dreaming. ......

I'm trapped in an elevator, its brushed steel walls now taking on an ominous sheen as water inexplicably begins seeping through the seams. At first, it's just a trickle - thin ribbons of crystalline liquid that snake down the walls like tears. But within moments, the trickle becomes a torrent. The water is shockingly cold, sending electric shivers through my body as it swirls around my ankles.

The elevator's fluorescent lights flicker and dance, casting strange, undulating shadows across the rising water's surface. The gentle hum of machinery has been replaced by the thunderous sound of rushing water and my own ragged breathing. I can taste the metallic tang of fear in my mouth as the water rises past my knees, then my waist.

Desperately, I pound on the elevator buttons, but they only respond with dead, hollow clicks. The digital floor display above the door glows an eerie red, showing impossible numbers and symbols that seem to shift and morph before my eyes. The water is at my chest now, and I find myself rising with it, my feet leaving the elevator floor as I begin to float.

Just as panic threatens to overwhelm me, something strange happens - the water takes on a luminescent quality, giving off a soft, aquamarine glow. Small, bioluminescent creatures that look like a cross between jellyfish and butterflies begin appearing in the water around me. They pulse with gentle light, creating an otherworldly ballet in the rising flood.

As the water reaches my chin, I take one final, deep breath, but instead of the expected terror, I feel an inexplicable sense of tranquility. The water filling my metal cage has become a portal to somewhere else, somewhere magical, and as it covers my head completely, I realize I can breathe underwater. The elevator walls dissolve into an vast ocean, and I'm no longer trapped - I'm being set free...
