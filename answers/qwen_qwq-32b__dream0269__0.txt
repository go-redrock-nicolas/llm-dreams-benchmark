I am dreaming. The document in front of me is sprawling, its edges curled like ocean waves frozen mid-crash. Each paragraph is a labyrinth of ink, shifting subtly as I scan them. I trace a finger along a sentence—a tiny portal opens beneath my touch, leading to a library where every book is blank. A voice whispers that completion demands more than ink—it needs imagination. I step into the library, and the door slams shut behind me. The walls pulse faintly, breathing. On the third shelf down, a book develops a title: "The Oversight." As I reach for it, the floor tilts, rearranging into stairs descending into earth's core. At the bottom, I find a courtroom where a jury of shadowy figures deliberate over my decisions. They sentence me to rewrite the document—but the pen I’m handed writes in flames, each corrected word becoming a star in the dream’s sky. Awakening, I realize the real document waits, now glowing faintly in the morning light, as if charged by stars.
