I am dreaming. My mind is a portal to a realm where the absurd and the fantastical blend with the deepest, darkest corners of my psyche. I find myself standing in the grand, ancient entrance of a cave, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and the whispers of forgotten generations. The darkness is alive, it pulses with an otherworldly energy that beckons me deeper, into the unknown.

As I step forward, my footsteps echo off the walls, a haunting melody that weaves in and out of the shadows. The ground beneath my feet begins to unravel, a hidden landscape of boulders and ancient fossils, worn smooth by the relentless torrent of time. I marvel at the sheer scale of this cavern, a mirrored dome stretching high above me, its vaulted ceiling lost in the blackness.

But my wonder is short-lived, for the ground gives way beneath me. The walls begin to shudder and tremble, a low rumble building in intensity until the earth itself seems to convulse. The cavern is convulsed by a maelstrom of sound, a cacophony of crashing rocks and plummeting debris. I stumble, desperate to find a hold, as the world around me dissolves into chaos.

When the tremors finally subside, I'm left in the darkness, my only light source – a small, flickering torch – shattered on the ground beside me. Panic sets in as I scramble to gather the scattered remnants of the shattered torch. It's futile; the futility of it is like a whispered poison in my ear. The light has been extinguished, plunging me into an abyss of darkness so profound, it's almost palpable.

Fear claws at my chest, crawling up my throat like a rabid creature. I fumble through the total darkness, desperate to reclaim the exit, but the entrance is gone, sealed by the earthquake's catastrophic hand. The thought pierces me like a cold blade – I'm trapped. I'm lost within a boundless, endless expanse of nothingness, and night shrouds me, relentlessly oliveAs the initial panic begins to swell, I force myself to think, to dig deep into my innate reserves of determination and resourcefulness. My heart pounds in my chest, and my breath comes in ragged gasps, but I steel myself against the creeping terror. Something inside me stirs, a spark that refuses to be extinguished, refusing to accept the darkness's total suffocation.

With trembling hands, I fumble through the inky blackness, attempting to retrace my footsteps, even as my mind whispers words of doom. Every step feels like a collapse, every step delicate and tentative, as if the earth beneath me might shatter. My hearing is consumed by the hum of the void, but it's not the peaceful silence that has claimed me. It's a somnambulant alertness, a why-existence kind of awareness that dares me from frightening.

I dig through my back pocket and grab for my runnable switch. I find it and fumble for my emergency supplies paper – first-aid kit, an extra battery for my vital Sat Force receiver – 

Oh no! It's the spare battery pack I've lost. My operational pouch drops down below me.
