I am dreaming. I am trying to convey something deeply important to me, but others seem unable to understand.  Facing this communication barrier, I feel frustrated and lonely.
In my dream, I find myself in a beautiful and unfamiliar world.  It is filled with breathtaking landscapes, colorful flora and fauna, and curious creatures.  I wander through this wonderland, marveling at its beauty and diversity.
As I explore, I encounter several people who greet me warmly and invite me to join them for a feast.  They offer me delicious food made from local ingredients, and refreshing drinks crafted with exotic spices.  We sit around a campfire, sharing stories and songs, laughter and tears.
While we eat and socialize, I notice that these individuals seem to be different from one another in some way.  Although they appear similar physically - all having the same shape, size, color, gender etcetera - they actually possess unique personalities, preferences, beliefs, experiences...you name it! 
I ask them about themselves, curious to learn more about their lives outside my dream.  But instead of answering me directly, they sing me songs, draw me pictures, play games with me...all in hopes that I will understand them better without words.
At first, I find this approach endearing and charming.  It reminds me of how children communicate with each other through symbols and gestures instead of language.  But then again, maybe that's why they seem so childlike to me...because deep down inside, they still are kids who never grew up physically but mentally stayed young forever because of their special circumstances which I don't know about yet.
Gradually however, I start feeling confused and isolated by this behavior.  Why won't they just talk to me like normal people? 
Why do they assume that I can't comprehend them unless they express themselves visually or musically?
