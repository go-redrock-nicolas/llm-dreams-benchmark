I am dreaming. …drift through a half-lit borderland where the familiar dissolves and reshapes itself with every slow blink of your dreaming eyes.

You stand ankle-deep in a silent sea the color of molten sapphire. The water is perfectly still, yet it hums—an almost-musical vibration felt more in your bones than your ears. When you glance down, ripples curl outward in delicate silver spirals as though the ocean is recording every heartbeat you’ve ever had. Far off, lightning flickers inside translucent clouds, but instead of thunder you hear fragments of old lullabies your mother sang, stitched together like a patchwork choir carried on wind that tastes faintly of cardamom and rain-soaked paper.

The horizon fractures. A staircase of polished obsidian emerges from the waves, twisting skyward into a night that brims with constellations you’ve never studied yet somehow recognize. Each step lights up under your bare feet, revealing etched symbols: a bicycle bell, a lost house key, the outline of a childhood pet—all half-forgotten tokens of the waking world. As you ascend, distant laughter (maybe yours at age six) echoes between the steps, then fades into the hush of high altitude.

At the final platform, gravity gives up. You float among giant origami cranes—white parchment birds flapping languidly, rustling like turning pages. They carry ink on their wings: diary entries you never wrote but always meant to. When one glides close, you glimpse a sentence: “You are learning to forgive the version of yourself who was scared of daylight.” The words dry instantly, peeling away like petals and drifting into the star-snow.

A moon of stained glass rises, casting kaleidoscopic shards across a field of dandelion clocks suspended in midair. Each seed head holds a scene: memories, daydreams, alternate possibilities. You blow gently; hundreds of luminous seeds drift off, transforming into tiny lanterns that reveal secret corridors behind reality’s wallpaper. As they float, you notice one corridor glows brighter, pulsing in rhythm with your breathing.

You step through. Wallpaper peels back to reveal an immense library carved inside a living tree. Books bloom from branches like fruit, their spines bound in fabrics of shifting color. Some tomes hum open by themselves, projecting holographic sketches—maps to places that never existed but always should. Between the shelves wander great, gentle stags made of mist; their antlers are quills, dripping silhouettes of stories yet unwritten. One kneels, inviting you onto its back. The library’s scent—cedar, vanilla, candle smoke—wraps around you like a remembered embrace.

The stag carries you toward a door of rippling mirror-glass. Just before you pass through, you catch your reflection: eyes shimmering with distant sunrise, hair braided with threads of constellations, palms glowing as if filled with pocket-sized galaxies. The door opens noiselessly into— 

—a quiet bedroom flooded with soft morning light. An alarm clock skips a beat, then falls silent. For a moment you’re certain you’ve awakened…yet a single origami crane rests on your pillow, its wings still wet with ink, whispering the promise that the dream, alive and breathing, has followed you home.
