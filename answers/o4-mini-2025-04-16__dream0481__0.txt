I am dreaming. I find myself utterly transfixed by a single drop of water perched on the edge of a cracked teacup rim. Others might call it trivial—just a bead of condensation—but under my gaze it becomes a universe unto itself. I lean closer, heart fluttering, and in that moment the drop pulses like a tiny planet, its surface alive with shifting rainbows.

Following this unique personal interest, I tiptoe across a table that stretches into infinity, as if the world itself has folded outward to make room for my curiosity. Each step makes the teacup wobble slightly, and the water-drop “planet” shivers with laughter. I slip through the arch of a cracked lip and suddenly the room dissolves: the wallpaper’s faded roses melt into fiery fractals, the worn teacup handle blossoms into arching ivory horns crowned with drifting moths.

I am weightless, sailing past monumental spoons that glint like silver skyscrapers. Beneath me, the wooden table’s grain ripples in emerald waves. The single drop I chased has grown colossal, a translucent globe floating ahead. Its surface ripples outward in concentric rings, each one carrying me deeper. I lean forward and am drawn inside.

Now I’m adrift in a moonlit cavern of liquid glass. The ceiling is a ceiling only in shape—the drop’s inner walls shimmer with constellations made of dissolved sugar crystals. Every time I breathe, a flurry of micro-comets arches across the domed sky, trailing stardust in my lungs. I float among them, gently swaying to a silent melody of dripping echoes, as if the very sound of time slows to the pace of a single heartbeat.

Here, in this mirrored, water-born cosmos, I feel an electric thrill—I am both explorer and the only audience, savoring a secret spectacle no one else would ever notice. And as I drift back toward the rim from which I first peered, the drop contracts, shifting back to its unassuming form. Yet I carry its vastness within me, awakened forever by the extraordinary hidden inside the simplest thing.
