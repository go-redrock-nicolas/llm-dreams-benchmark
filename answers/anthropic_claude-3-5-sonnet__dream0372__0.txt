I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast crystal cavern where the walls pulse with living light, each beat synchronizing with my own heartbeat. As I become aware that I'm dreaming, the realization about scarcity versus abundance washes over me like a warm wave of golden light. The crystalline formations around me begin to multiply and grow, spreading like frost on a winter morning, but they're made of pure possibility rather than ice.

Each step I take leaves footprints of blooming flowers behind me - not just any flowers, but ones made of opportunities and potential, their petals unfurling to reveal small galaxies within. I reach out to touch the cavern wall, and instead of cold stone, it feels like touching liquid sunshine. The sensation triggers an profound epiphany: I've been holding my breath in life, rationing my energy and dreams as if they were finite resources.

The cavern opens into an infinite space where waterfalls flow upward, carrying fragments of all the ideas and opportunities I've ever dismissed out of fear or self-doubt. They collect in a suspended pool above, forming a mirror that reflects not my physical self, but the abundant version of me that has always existed beneath the surface - radiant, unlimited, and overflowing with potential.

Swirling around me, threads of light weave themselves into a tapestry showing all the times I said "no" when I could have said "yes," all the moments I chose limitation over expansion. But rather than feeling regret, I feel liberation. Each thread begins to unravel and reweave itself into new patterns of possibility.

The air itself becomes thick with inspiration, each breath filling my lungs with the knowledge that abundance isn't something to be found - it's something that already exists within, waiting to be acknowledged and embraced. The dream pulses with this truth, embedding it into every cell of my being: I am not a vessel to be filled, but a source from which abundance naturally flows.

As the dream begins to fade, the crystals sing a harmonic melody that I recognize as my own voice, finally free from the constraints of scarcity thinking. I'm left with the unshakeable understanding that abundance isn't about having more - it's about recognizing that there was never less to begin with.
