I am dreaming. The surrounding is an utopia beyond paradise. Everywhere I look, my eyes are flooded with the lucious colors of a meadow flourished with beautiful wild flowers  dancing to the rhythm of the sweet breeze caressing my hair gently. Suddenly the mint green skies with hues of lavender, pink and chrome yellow clouds become a deep majestic Royal blue. The skies glisten with sparkles as they come alive with moons,stars, constellations and planets. I stand next to a telescope observing the beautiful creatures on Jupiter interested to know more about the unique creatures that sail the skies like hot air balloons. 

Suddenly I am teleported to a tropical paradise  withal creatures as unique as would be seen from pages pf national geographic. They are magnificent and diverse. I hear laughter and automatic applaud myself for reaching this slice of life. Finally I really love who I am, and who I have become. My walks towards destination 'Authentic Me' still has few steps to go but I thank my human who has let me taste this slice of dream, which inevitably has to end.

I slowly drift to the real world. Indeed we wear various masks in the public, however the true power lies in feeling the magic of 'Authentic You' inside.
