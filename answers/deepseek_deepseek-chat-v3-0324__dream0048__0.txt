I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the air is thick with the scent of rust and ozone, the metallic tang pressing against my tongue like a living thing. The ground beneath me shudders—somewhere, far below, something vast stirs, a leviathan of gears and grinding pistons. I am running, though I don’t know from what. My breath comes in ragged gasps, my pulse a frantic drumbeat in my throat.  

Then I see it.  

The machine rises before me, a monolith of forgotten engineering, its surface etched with symbols that writhe like serpents when I try to focus on them. It hums—not a sound, but a vibration in my bones, a resonance that makes my teeth ache. It is old. Older than the crumbling ruins around me, older than the stars that flicker weakly through the cavern’s jagged ceiling.  

I don’t know how to make it work. There are no levers, no buttons, no obvious controls—only a labyrinth of spinning cogs, pulsing conduits of liquid light, and a central chamber where something dark and shapeless drifts like ink in water.  

The ground trembles again. Closer this time.  

I press my hands against the machine’s surface, and it *reacts*. The metal warms beneath my touch, the symbols flaring to life in veins of cobalt and gold. A voice—no, not a voice, a *presence*—whispers in the back of my skull. It speaks in a language I don’t know, yet somehow understand.  

*"You must choose."*  

Before me, the machine splits open, revealing three hollows, each pulsing with a different hue: one crimson as a dying sun, one the deep green of rotting forests, and one a blinding white that sears my vision.  

The thing pursuing me is near now. I can hear it—the wet, rhythmic *ing* of chitinous limbs, the hiss of steam from a dozen vents.  

I must choose.  

I must make the machine work.  

Or I will never wake up.
