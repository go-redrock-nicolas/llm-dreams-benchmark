I am dreaming. …open your eyes to an impossible skyline, one that folds in on itself like origami made of sunrise. A silver bridge spirals upward in corkscrews, dangling over an ocean that glows cobalt from within. You hover above the water, buoyed by nothing but a breeze that tastes of peppermint and thunder.  

A hummingbird, wearing spectacles far too large for its beak, flits in front of you and clears its throat with the solemnity of a maître-d’.  
“Congratulations,” it chirps, voice magnified as though through cathedral speakers. “The Infinite Consortium of Brilliant Minds has unanimously selected you as project lead.”  

Lightning forks across the clouds, spelling your name in cursive. Applause erupts from every direction—clapping canyon walls, clapping silk flowers, clapping constellations that pop like camera flashes. Your stomach hollows, the way books sometimes feel hollow when their pages are blank.  

“But I don’t even know the project,” you protest, though no sound seems to leave your mouth. Instead, the words crystallize into tiny ice-sculpture letters that tumble to the sea below, hissing into vapor.  

The hummingbird ushers you onto the spiral bridge. Each step rearranges itself, the planks swapping textures—polished mahogany, then rain-slick cobblestone, then slices of moonlight. At the summit perches a glass-domed observatory the size of a small planet. Inside awaits your “team”:  

• A stoic golem carved from library shelves, encyclopedias glowing like ember-stoked bricks beneath its bark-paper skin.  
• A woman made of clockwork gears, her every gesture accompanied by a waterfall of tick-tock harmonies.  
• A tiger in a lab coat, spectacles balanced on its snout, jotting equations in the air with one velvet paw.  
• A breeze that takes the shape of a person only when you look directly at it.  

They pivot toward you, expectation bright in their eyes—or eye sockets, in the golem’s case. A holographic schematic hovers above a crystal table: an impossible machine called the Aurora Loom. Its purpose is to weave starlight into bridges so distant planets can greet one another at dawn. You’ve never heard of such technology; the very diagrams feel like a foreign alphabet.  

Sweat beads across your palms, turning to pearls that roll across the floor and sprout into white roses. Impostor, your inner echo mutters, but it sounds like it comes from every corner of the observatory. You consider fleeing—yet the doorway has dissolved into a mural of stories you haven’t written yet, sealing your exit with possibility.  

The clockwork woman opens her chest panel, revealing a pendulum heart that swings too quickly, frantic. “Parameters keep collapsing,” she says. “We need a conductor—someone to find rhythm amid chaos.”  
The tiger taps the schematic. “Leadership isn’t expertise,” it growls softly. “It’s orchestration.”  
The golem’s voice quavers like wind riffling pages. “Arrange us.”  

Your pulse thrums louder than the storm outside. Then, almost without thinking, you let curiosity outrun fear. You circle the table, letting questions fizz from your fingertips, each query blooming into a floating post-it of luminescent ink. You ask the breeze to map cosmic jet streams; it coalesces into ribbons of airflow illustrating interstellar lanes. You invite the tiger to translate the mathematics into melodic vibrations; the numbers become chord progressions that ring through the observatory. The golem summons reference volumes at your request, stacking them into stepping-stone logic. The clockwork engineer listens to the rhythm and adjusts the Loom’s cogs, aligning theory with resonance.  

Soon the schematic responds: colors converge, gears click, beams of liquid dawn drizzle through stained-glass planets. The Aurora Loom hums alive, threads of nacreous light stretching outward, stitching horizon to horizon like lace on the hem of space.  

In that instant you realize: your lack of expertise was never an anchor—it was ballast you’d mistaken for weight. Freed from it, you float, or perhaps all of you do, drifting together inside the dome as if gravity itself applauds. Outside, galaxies tether themselves to the Loom’s glowing braid. An entire universe begins to hold hands.  

The hummingbird returns, adjusting its spectacles. “Impressive,” it says, jotting in a notebook made of featherfall. “Your impostor self left at the first sign of dawn.”  
You smile, sensing the echo fade. And somewhere far below, the ocean of cobalt sings your name back to you, not in thunder this time, but in quiet confidence.  

The dream begins to fold at the edges—sunrise closing like a curtain—yet you carry one shimmering thread of star-lace in your pocket, proof that you once led a cosmos to daybreak despite knowing nothing at all.
