I am dreaming. …I step across a threshold made of moon-silver mist and immediately feel the physics of waking life evaporate. My feet leave the ground—no, the ground leaves me—and an unseen current ferries me through a cathedral of clouds. Somewhere far below (or maybe above, directions keep unspooling), a brass gong tolls the beginning of the final evaluation. 

This is the Aureate Symposium, held once every century by a council of beings so old they have forgotten their own childhood names. The prize: the Prism of Echelons, a multifaceted jewel rumored to refract reality itself. To secure it, I must prove mastery in three disciplines—Creation, Compassion, and Courage—each tested in a chamber born of my own subconscious.  

CHAMBER I: CREATION  
The clouds dissolve, replaced by a boundless atelier that smells of cedar, ozone, and half-remembered lullabies. Blank canvases orbit me like patient planets. Brushes hover, bristles sparkling with unblended pigment; chisels hum; sheet music rustles though no paper exists. A judge materializes: a giant seahorse stitched from constellations. Its voice is a choir of violins: “Make something that has never existed yet feels inevitable.”  

I close my eyes and reach inward, past nerves and memories, down to the core ember where dreams ferment. My fingers weave invisible strings. As I open my palms, colors burst—teal that tastes of peppermint and sunset-orange that rings like small bells. The pigments twirl into a single shape: an hourglass whose grains are miniature dawns. Each grain ignites into sunrise whenever it strikes the glass, so the hourglass resets itself in perpetual genesis. The seahorse nods; starlight drips from its mane, signing approval upon the air.

CHAMBER II: COMPASSION  
Without warning, gravity reclaims me, and I tumble into a garden at perpetual dusk. Bioluminescent lilies whisper gossip to mossy stones. Here the judge is an elderly tortoise wearing spectacles wrought from dew. On his shell glow holograms of suffering: a grieving child, a withered tree, a silent war-torn city. “Feel them all,” he says, “then choose one burden and carry it farther than its owner can.”  

I kneel before the visions, each pulse of pain pricking like static against my ribs. I extend my arm to the image of the withered tree—its branches skeletal, its roots grinding against parched soil. I cup the ghostly sapling in my hands; it shrinks to seed form, vibrating with thirst. I swallow it. Immediately I feel dryness scorch my throat, sap thickening into sorrow in my veins.  

The scene tilts. Stormclouds gather. My tears, now heavy with the tree’s yearning, fall as crystalline raindrops onto the garden floor. Wherever they land, new shoots spear upward—emerald, jubilant. The tortoise closes his eyes as fresh greenery wreathes his shell. “Well carried,” he murmurs, and the burden dissolves, leaving behind a sweet aftertaste of rain and relief.

CHAMBER III: COURAGE  
A squeal of hinges, and I stand on a bridge of cracked mirrors suspended over a void. Wind howls, scattering shards that slice ovals of starlight into ribbons. Far end: the final judge—a faceless figure draped in a cloak woven from my own doubts. Within its hood, swirling questions: Are you enough? Will you fracture?  

Midway across, the mirrors glitch, reflecting futures where I fail: audiences laughing, the Prism shattering, myself shrinking into anonymity. My pulse syncs with the tremor of the bridge. Courage, I remind myself, is not fearlessness but forward motion in spite of it.  

I touch the glass beneath my boot and whisper the names of every mentor, friend, and stranger who ever believed in me. Each name glows, fusing cracks into seamless paths. Step by step, voice by voice, the bridge stabilizes until I stand before the judge. I reach up, pull back the hood—and see my own face, but older, wiser, eyes brimming with equal parts terror and wonder. We nod to each other, and the figure melts into vapor that wraps around me like a second skin.

THE PRISM OF ECHELONS  
The three chambers collapse into a whirlwind of confetti constellations. At its epicenter spins the Prism, casting prismatic rivers across the dark. I extend my hand. The jewel lands in my palm, weightless yet vast, and begins to rotate. Each facet displays the scenes I just lived, looping them infinitely outward.  

The symposium audience erupts in a chorus of galaxies laughing, roses applauding with petal-soft claps, and thunder giving a standing ovation. Somewhere in the back row, a quiet star winks, as if saying, “Remember, the award was never the point—it was the journey through your own uncharted rooms.”

I breathe in colors, exhale possibility, and the dream dissolves into dawn, scattering dew on the roof of morning.
