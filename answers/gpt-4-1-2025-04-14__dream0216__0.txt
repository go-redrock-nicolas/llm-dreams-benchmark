I am dreaming.

After the ship vanished beneath the bruised, heaving waves, I washed ashore to a narrow crescent of sand carved between a jade jungle and an endless cerulean horizon. My ragged breaths mingled with the gulls’ harsh cries overhead as I looked down my trembling hands—my only companions, a battered canteen with a mouthful of water, a rusty pocketknife, and a salt-stiffened jacket.

Night fell quickly, the sun bleeding crimson behind silhouetted palms. I fashioned a desperate lean-to of palm fronds against a granite outcrop, coaxed a flame from splintered driftwood, and watched the firelight flicker across the unfamiliar face of my new world. The symphony of crickets and the ceaseless lapping of waves replaced all human conversation.

Days dripped by, measured only by the sun’s bruised passage overhead. My body grew leaner, my dreams more fevered. The forest beckoned with the scent of overripe fruit and unknown dangers—the flash of emerald feathers, the distant roar of some unseen predator in the night. When I finally ventured deeper, I discovered a freshwater pool, half-swallowed by flowering vines. A family of curious monkeys eyed me from their perch, chattering as though they were guardians of some forgotten realm.

Desperation bred invention. I sharpened stick to spear, and learned to fish in sparkling tidepools, the translucent fish darting just out of reach. I learned the taste of bitter roots, the methodical patience of watching for rain, the thunder’s promise growing into sweet salvation from clouds black as ink.

Each night, I climbed to the highest rock and searched the horizon for the pale triangle of a sail, the distant puff of smoke, anything human. Instead, the stars pressed in—too close, too bright, as if watching my solitude. Sometimes, I imagined voices in the wind, echoes of laughter and music, the familiar scent of bread from a memory I could almost touch.

As time stretched thin as the morning mist, my senses sharpened. The world bounded with color and sound—the impossible turquoise of the lagoon, the symphonic cacophony of insects in the dusk, the delicate perfume of unseen blossoms. I was no longer just a castaway, but an exile reborn, every sensation richer and deeper than I’d ever known.

I awoke each day uncertain whether rescue was blessing or curse, my old world dissolving into the primordial beauty and terror of this one. Would I be found, or had I found myself? The dream shifted, dissolving in the white blaze of the sun, but the taste of salt, the endless wind, the wild fear and wilder wonder lingered, vivid as waking life.
