I am dreaming. I find myself standing atop a lush, emerald hill, the grass tickling my bare feet. The sun is a brilliant orb, streaming down its warm, golden rays that caress my skin. A gentle breeze carries the fragrance of blooming flowers and fresh, earthy soil. I close my eyes and inhale deeply, feeling the fresh air fill my lungs, my body tingling with renewed vigor.

The environment around me is in harmony, each element seamlessly melding with the others to create a perfect symphony of nature's finest gifts. Birds chirp happily in the distance, their melodic songs adding to the symphony of life that surrounds me. In the distance, a babbling brook meanders through a grove of oak trees, their branches swaying in the breeze like the arms of sunbathing nymphs.

I lie down on the soft grass, feeling the earth beneath me, firm yet yielding. As I stare up at the cotton candy clouds drifting lazily across the infinite blue sky, I feel a deep inner peace and connection with the world around me. The sun, the earth, the air, the water - all three are in perfect balance, providing me with everything I need to feel vital, energized and mentally clear.

Suddenly, I hear a clamor of angry voices boiling up from the valley below. Glancing down, I see a smoggy, chaotic city, the buildings crumbling, the air thick with exhaust and the smell of rot. Street fights are happening in each abandoned lot and walkway.  The few trees remaining are shrunken and bare, the vibrancy of life drained.

I watch in horror as the negative energy from the city starts to creep up the hill, spreading like a plague. The once-vibrant grass starts to turn brown and wither, the flowers duck their heads and droop, as the toxic air swallows the life out of the world around me. The sky darkens, the clouds forming thunderous shapes. My peace turns to dread as I realize the city is slowly killing the hill, moment by momentarily, with its evil presence.

I roll off this polluted hill and onto the golden hill again, the vivid sky stretching out forever. I recognize that I can only maintain this state by separating myself from the negative influences around me. By regrouping and focusing on the positive aspects of my life, I am able to protect my own inner peace and energy.

I feel a rush of euphoria and empowerment as I realize that I have the power to control my own mind and emotions, no matter what the environment around me may be. I am the master of my own destiny, and with each breath of fresh air and each ray of sunshine, I grow stronger, wiser, and happier.

With that thought, I open my eyes, a brilliant smile on my face as I revel in the beauty and wonder of this dream, knowing that when I wake up, I will carry this newfound knowledge with me, ready to face whatever challenges life may throw my way.
