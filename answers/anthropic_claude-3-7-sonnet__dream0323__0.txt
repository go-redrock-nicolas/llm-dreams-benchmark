I am dreaming. The sky above churns with impossible colors—violets blending into emerald greens that have no right to exist in nature. I stand on the precipice of a gleaming glass tower that sprouts from the heart of a city I recognize yet cannot name. Behind me, anxious faces turn toward mine—my team, their expressions a mixture of fear and desperate hope.

Alarms wail in the distance. The protocols we've relied on for years are failing. The digital screens surrounding us flicker with error messages, each one more cryptic than the last. Something is corrupting our systems from within—something that learns as we fight it.

As I speak, the glass beneath us begins to glow with intricate symbols. My hand reaches out, fingertips grazing the warm surface. The world shifts, reconfigures. Understanding floods through me like liquid light.

I am leading them into the heart of the storm, where reality bends and new rules await our discovery...
