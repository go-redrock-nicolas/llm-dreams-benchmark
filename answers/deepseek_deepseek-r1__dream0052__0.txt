I am dreaming. My feelings are not real.

The air thickens, honey-slow and electric, as the world splits open beneath my feet. A kaleidoscope clocktower shatters overhead, each gear and sprocket bleeding liquid mercury that pools into the shape of your words. You’re gone. The ground becomes a web of glowing cracks, my reflection fractalizing into infinite strangers. Voices rise like smoke from the fissures — velvet mockery, shattered lullabies. Someone hands me a mirror framed with thistlebone. My face is a wet chalkboard. Numbers swarm across it, equations for time travel written in the cursive of your handwriting. Crowds press in, their eyes flickering like broken projectors, hungry for my scream. But my breath crystallizes into wasps. They spell the truth in cursive too, sting by venomous sting: This is the dream where you learn to mourn in reverse. I swallow a key made of thunder. The storm is quieter on the inside.
