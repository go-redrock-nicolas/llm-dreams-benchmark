I am dreaming. A shimmering starling alights on my windowpane, its feathers a kaleidoscope of swirling galaxies. Its song is a melody of quantum entanglements, entwining itself into the fibers of my being. I feel the universe shifting, rearranging itself around the improbable symphony it weaves. A cascade of fireflies erupts from the constellation-laden plumage, their lights coalescing into a luminous path that spirals into the unknown. Drawn inexorably forward, I step into a realm where the laws of chance bend and tremble, where the improbable dominates. The ground beneath my feet trembles with a resonance that feels alive, as if the very earth beneath me were a breathing entity. I step forward, each footfall an act of faith in this whimsical, unpredictable universe, wondering what other wonders await me in this candygram to infinity.
