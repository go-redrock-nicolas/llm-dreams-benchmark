I am dreaming. You’re breathing hard, heart drumming in your ears as the hospital’s endless corridors stretch before you like canyons of bone and steel. The fluorescent lights above flicker, each blink echoing in the hushed spaces between shrieks and murmurs. Everywhere you look, nurses and orderlies move in a frenzied ballet: gurneys tiptoe through the halls, IV poles spin like spindly dancers, and the scent of antiseptic stings your nostrils like a waking curse.

At triage, the slate is bleeding red—so many wounded, so few hands to heal. You lift your gaze: a child with eyes like fractured glass, a soldier whose uniform is a rag of ash, an elderly woman whose pulse flickers so faintly you could mistake it for a breath of dust. Behind each face is a story screaming to be heard, but your own voice feels muffled beneath layers of exhaustion and dread.

The hospital transforms before you. Walls ripple like watercolors left in the rain, the linoleum underfoot melting into pools of liquid silver. Monitors bleep in urgent Morse code, their alarms weaving a frantic tapestry of sound. You sprint down a hallway that stretches impossibly—doors appear and vanish as if the building itself can’t decide where it begins or ends. You chase a phantom echo of a nurse’s cry, but by the time you catch sight of her, she’s already slipped around the bend, carrying a gurney too heavy even for her dream-wrought strength.

You find yourself in the operating theater, where the ceiling has opened up into starless night. A single lamp hovers above the patient, its beam a pinpoint of hope in the darkness. Instruments hover in mid-air, beckoning you closer. You don gloves of creeping midnight; their surface ripples beneath your fingers, like living shadow. As you lean over the table, you realize the patient is you—your own blood welling up in slow motion, each drop a ticking second. Panic surges, but you clamp your own veins, halt the tide, and reroute flow with threads of golden filament. The world hushes, and in that silence you taste triumph.

Then the scene shatters like glass underfoot. You’re back at the nurse’s station, strapped into the wingback chair you never remember sitting in. Resource bins float past you on conveyor belts, emptying and refilling in an endless loop. Under your fingertips the phone burns hot—it rings…but you can’t answer. The board behind you glows with names in pulsing red: every person you’ve failed and every one you can still save.

A soft voice brushes your ear, carrying no blame but the promise of dawn: “You are the healer, even when you feel broken.” In that moment, you lift your head. The corridors pause; the monitors quiet. You step into the hallway once more, ready to face the cascade with one steady breath, knowing that every life you touch ripples outward, a single star igniting the dark.
