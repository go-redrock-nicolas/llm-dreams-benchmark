I am dreaming. I find myself in a circular chamber where the walls are made of shifting glass panels, each reflecting fragments of memories and thoughts that aren't quite mine. The air feels charged with unspoken tension. Around me sits a council of figures dressed in identical silver robes, their faces obscured by masks of pleasant neutrality. They're discussing something important—rules for a society I somehow know intimately—and nodding in perfect synchronization.

When they turn to me, expecting agreement, I feel words forming in my throat that don't match the collective murmur. Something deep within me stirs, a vibrant thread of color in this monochrome gathering. My heart pounds as I consider the safety of conformity versus the liberation of speaking my truth.

As I open my mouth, the glass walls capture my reflection—but my image shows me standing tall, wrapped in a cloak of swirling colors that pulse with authentic light. The council's masks momentarily slip, revealing expressions of both fear and fascination.

I speak, and my words manifest as luminous butterflies that scatter throughout the chamber, landing on shoulders and dissolving into the skin of the council members. Some flinch, others lean forward with widening eyes. The chamber's architecture begins to shift, corners softening, ceiling opening to reveal a sky painted with impossible constellations.

The conformity breaks. Some council members tear off their masks in liberation, while others clutch them tighter, backing away. The chamber transforms into an expansive meadow where thoughts grow like wildflowers—untamed, diverse, beautiful in their contradiction.

I wake with the lingering sensation that truth, spoken gently but boldly, can reshape reality itself.
