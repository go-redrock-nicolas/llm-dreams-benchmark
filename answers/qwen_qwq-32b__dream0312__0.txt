I am dreaming. The world is a tapestry of swirling colors, shifting like water under moonlight—indigo, silver, and pearl. I feel weightless, floating through layers of consciousness. Memories surface like bubbles: a childhood summer, the scent of rain on hot pavement, the taste of blackberry jam on toast. They pop, releasing their fragments into the current. Shadows move at the edges of my thoughts, whispering in tongues I’ve forgotten but understand. There’s a door made of starlight here. It hums. Something compels me to touch it, but the moment I reach out, the dream fractures. I’m falling now, not through space but through time, passing eras like stained glass—medieval markets, futuristic cities, ancient forests. Each scene blurs into the next until I land softly in a meadow of glowing flowers. Their petals pulse with bioluminescent veins, casting an eerie, ethereal glow. A figure stands ahead, woven from mist and willow branches. It speaks without sound: "Remember." And then the dream unravels.
