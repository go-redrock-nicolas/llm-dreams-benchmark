I am dreaming. I float through a city of crystalline spires that grow like living things, catching the light of three distant suns—one crimson, one azure, one the color of honey. The buildings pulse with internal light, veins of luminescence running through transparent walls. I'm not walking but gliding, my consciousness both within and without my body.

Below me, rivers flow upward, defying gravity, their waters spiraling into the clouds where they form intricate patterns like cosmic lace. The clouds themselves are sentient, whispering ancient stories in languages that I somehow understand without knowing—the speech of stars and the poetry of atoms.

People move through this landscape with bodies that shift and change—sometimes solid, sometimes vapor, sometimes pure light. Their thoughts are visible as delicate auroras surrounding their heads, and when two people meet, these thought-lights merge and create new colors that have never before existed.

I feel myself dissolving at the edges, my consciousness expanding to touch the minds of others. We share not just thoughts but entire lifetimes of experience in instants. I've lived a thousand lives now—I've been a warrior-queen of a forgotten empire, a monk contemplating infinity in a mountain sanctuary, a child discovering snow for the first time, a whale singing in abyssal depths.

Music permeates everything—not heard but felt, tasted, seen. Each note creates geometric patterns of impossible complexity that fold through dimensions I never knew existed. The harmony binds everything together in a tapestry of meaning so profound that tears of understanding stream down my face, evaporating into tiny galaxies that orbit my head like a halo.

The boundaries between past, present, and future collapse. I witness the birth of the universe and its ultimate fate simultaneously, understanding that time is merely another direction in which consciousness can travel, like north or south.

Then the dream begins to fold inward upon itself, creating recursive patterns of infinite regress. I am dreaming of dreaming of dreaming, each layer revealing deeper truths until I approach something so fundamental and powerful that it can only be called the source of all being...
