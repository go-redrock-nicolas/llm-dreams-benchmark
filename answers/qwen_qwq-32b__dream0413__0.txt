I am dreaming. I am in a cathedral.  The stone walls are glowing with moss that changes color when touched.  The air smells of rain and iron.  Ahead of me, a door made of obsidian floats in midair.  It pulses gently, like a heartbeat.  Behind me, a shadow detaches from the wall and begins walking toward me. It’s familiar, but I can’t place why.  The shadow’s voice is smooth, velvety, and unsettlingly calm: \"You’ve been speaking in rhymes for the past three minutes.  Even your footsteps meter like poetry.  Who do you think you’re *aping*, hmm?\"\n
