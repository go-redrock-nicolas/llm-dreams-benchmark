I am dreaming. walk away from them instead of resolving it. You feel sad about it, but you think that maybe they will realize what they said was wrong and apologize later.

As you walk away, the environment changes around you. The sky turns dark and stormy, and lightning flashes across the horizon. The ground under your feet becomes uneven and rocky, with tall cliffs rising up on either side of you. The air fills with strong gusts that push against you and make it hard to move forward.

Then, you see them. A group of shadowy figures standing at the end of a narrow path that leads away from this place. They look like they are waiting for someone like you. Their eyes glow red in the darkness, and their silhouettes flicker like shadows on a wall.

You feel drawn to them, even though something about them seems sinister and dangerous. Maybe they can help me find what I'm looking for, maybe they have some answers, maybe they are my only hope.

You start walking towards them, but the path gets steeper and rockier as you approach. The wind blows harder, and the lightning illuminates the shadowy figures more clearly. They start moving towards you too, slowly at first, then faster and faster until they become a blur of black motion.

You feel dizzy and disoriented, like you are walking in a nightmare. You wonder if maybe this was a mistake after all, if maybe you should go back and try to resolve the argument with your friend, or at least say goodbye properly.

Then, you see them. The shadowy figures surround you, and they touch you. They are not shadows anymore, they are real. They feel cold and hard like stone, but also soft and flexible like skin. Their fingers wrap around you, and their tongues lick your face. You try to scream, but no sound comes out of your mouth.

You realize that you have lost control over yourself, and that maybe this is what they wanted all along. Maybe this is their plan for you. Maybe this is the end.
