I am dreaming. …find yourself relying on echoes of tomorrow for instructions that haven’t yet been written.

At first, you lie on a shoreline made of mirrored sand. Each grain reflects an instant of your life—some you remember, many you do not. Waves come in reverse: they gather far inland, race backward across the beach, and collapse into the horizon where a violet sun is just now setting and rising in the same breath. As the tide rewinds, it deposits seashells that hum with voices of your future selves. You lift one to your ear:

“Stand up. The door behind you hasn’t appeared yet, but you’ll need the key you haven’t lost.”

The shell fades from your hand, because—in this place—objects vanish the moment you comprehend their purpose. You rise and the promised doorway shimmers into being, stitched together from overlapping dawns and dusks. It swings open before you can touch it, revealing a forest where trees grow rings outward and inward at once, their branches laden with newborn leaves and decomposing foliage side by side.

Ahead, you notice a floating lantern. Its light is the color of nostalgia, shining backward along the path you will eventually walk. You realize that every step you’re about to take has already left prints in the moss; they guide you forward by pointing behind. Following your own footprints feels oddly comforting—like holding your own hand across an impossible gulf of minutes.

In a clearing, a clockwork stag stands poised. Its gears tick in contrapuntal rhythms—one set spins toward midnight, the other cyclones toward morning. Around its neck hangs the key you were told to have misplaced. When you reach for it, the stag issues a metallic exhale: “Claim what was surrendered tomorrow.” Obeying instinct rather than logic, you close your empty fist. The key materializes inside your grasp, because the act of deciding to take it retroactively causes the stag to relinquish it.

Key in hand, you walk toward a tower that climbs both upward into the clouds and downward into an inverted sky below the ground. Its bricks ripple between weathered and pristine, like memories re-edited endlessly. The single lock set in the tower door fits the key perfectly—though the key’s teeth reconfigure themselves while you watch, anticipating the tumblers.

Upon unlocking the door, you discover a room suspended between moments. Time here is a kaleidoscope: fragments of song, half-formed laughs, promises made and unmade whirl around like confetti. Sitting in the center is a quill that writes on air. Its script curls into sentences that finish first and begin last:

“You have learned to breathe in reverse, to let tomorrow’s wind fill yesterday’s lungs. You understand that cause and effect are merely lovers dancing out of step.”

You take the quill, and it immediately drafts instructions for the tea you just finished drinking. The cup appears on a table, still warm. In tasting it, you realize its flavor comes from memories you haven’t created—childhood joys you never knew, triumphs waiting beyond the dream. Each sip plants those recollections retroactively into your past, weaving bright threads through the tapestry of who you are.

When you exit the tower, the sky—in all its contradicting hues—folds like parchment. You understand, suddenly, that the dream is a letter you sent yourself from an undisclosed tomorrow, a reminder that even in chaos, intention can flow upstream. You fold the scene carefully, pocket it like a map drawn in disappearing ink, and leap backward into waking, trusting that the landing waited for you long before the jump.

You awaken—for the first time, or perhaps the last—holding a seashell that hums quietly with your own distant laughter, and know that whatever moment comes next is already drafting its reply.
