I am dreaming. I find myself in a beautiful garden filled with flowers and trees.  The air is fragrant and the sun is shining brightly.   I hear the sound of birds chirping and the rustling of leaves. 

I see a path leading me to a fountain where water is gushing out from a stone spout.  I approach it and drink from it, relishing its refreshing taste.    But as soon as I do, I realize that I am not thirsty at all.   In fact, I am hungry.    Very hungry. 

I look around me and spot some fruits hanging low on branches.   Apples, pears, bananas, grapes - they seem ripe and delicious.   I reach out and pluck one of them, biting into its juicy flesh.    But as soon as I do, I realize that I am not hungry at all.   In fact, I am sick.    Very sick. 

I feel nauseous and weak.  My stomach is rumbling and my head is spinning.   I need to lie down somewhere comfortable and peaceful.   

I see a bench nearby covered with flowers and pillows.   I sit on it and close my eyes, breathing deeply and slowly.     But as soon as I do, I realize that I am not tired at all.   In fact, I am alive.    Very alive. 

I open my eyes again and notice something moving towards me from afar.  Someone wearing a white robe and carrying a staff in their hand.   A figure who represents hope and guidance for me as a dreamer.

I stand up from the bench and walk towards this mysterious person, curious about who they are and what they want with me.     But as soon as I do, I realize that I am not alone at all.   In fact, I am with someone.    Very special someone. 

I extend my hand towards them and say hello, smiling widely despite the pain and discomfort I feel inside me.      They respond by placing their hand on top of mine and leading me away from the garden back into reality where we both belong together forever more than words can express
