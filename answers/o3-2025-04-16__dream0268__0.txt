I am dreaming. …I am dreaming.

I open my eyes to a sky the color of melted clock-faces—liquid bronze swirling with violet. The ground beneath me is not ground at all but a tessellated mosaic of faded newspaper clippings, each tile fluttering like a restless wing. When I take a step, entire headlines rearrange themselves under my feet:

“THE DAY EVERYTHING CHANGED,” one fragment insists.  
“NEVER HAPPENED,” another contradicts.

A warm wind carries the scent of petrichor and old film reels, and I realize that the very air seems spliced together from half-remembered scenes. Far ahead stands a crooked archway of unfinished sentences, letters dangling as though someone forgot where they belonged. I pass beneath it and enter a hallway with doors on either side—each door made of mismatched memories sawn together: half mahogany, half chalkboard, half stained glass. On the surface of every door, a flickering image plays. Some feel familiar: a market stall with laughing strangers, a candlelit birthday cake missing two candles, a child’s drawing of a house that has no windows.

A voice trails after me, echoing like a distant projector reel: “Why can’t you remember it the way we do?” The voice belongs to everyone and no one—each syllable layered with tones of family, friends, and people I’ve never met. It’s the collective conviction of the world outside the dream, tugging at the loose threads of my uncertainty.

I choose the door whose image is grainiest, nearly worn transparent: a black-and-white snowstorm of static obscuring a single word—“TOGETHER.” The knob is cold as moonlight. When it turns, the hallway tilts, the mosaic floor shivers, and I tumble through.

Now I’m in an immense library with no ceiling, only undulating auroras of ink. Towering shelves stretch upward until they dissolve into darkness, and every book spine is blank. An antique phonograph sits on a table made of driftwood; its horn emits whispers instead of music, snatches of the same event told in a dozen clashing ways:

“Remember the red scarf.”  
“There was no scarf, it was a blue umbrella.”  
“It never rained at all.”

I pull a book at random. Its pages are mirrors, reflecting a version of me I don’t recognize—older, perhaps wiser, eyes rimmed with saltwater. The mirror-pages flutter on their own, whipping up a cyclone of silver shards. Out of the storm floats a single memory shard:

A train platform bathed in lantern light.  
Someone waves goodbye.  
I can’t see their face.

Suddenly the library shakes. Shelves bend into ribbons, books melt into puddles of inky regret, and the ceilingless sky descends like a curtain of night velvet. Out from between the collapsing stacks strides a figure in a coat stitched from map fragments. They carry a lantern inside which a tiny theater plays the event on repeat—each performance different. They hand the lantern to me without speaking.

The little theater shows the platform again. This time I’m the one waving. Then it rewinds: I’m the one leaving. Rewinds again: there is no platform, only a field of silver grass. Every version looks plausible; none feels true. My mind claws at them, desperate to find the one memory that fits the lock of certainty.

The figure taps the lantern glass. A spiderweb crack blossoms, and light spills over my hands. The lantern dissolves into fireflies that circle my head, each insect a miniaturized scene. They whisper in chorus, “Choose.”

I reach for the brightest firefly, but as my fingers brush its glow, it splinters into dust. Another dims. Another flares. I realize each memory survives only by my attention. If I choose, I might erase everything else—yet if I don’t, they’ll flicker out anyway.

The library’s last shelf sighs and collapses. Fireflies scatter into the dark like celestial punctuation marks. I stand alone in the silence, clutching nothing but the echo of that word on the door… “TOGETHER.”

And so the dream ends unresolved, the past still a kaleidoscope of contradictions, the truth hiding somewhere between the lantern’s ashes and the hum of disappearing fireflies. I wake with the taste of bronze sky on my tongue, a phantom farewell echoing in my ears—certain only that the most important detail is the one even the dream refused to reveal.
