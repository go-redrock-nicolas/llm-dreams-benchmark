I am dreaming. I'm engulfed in a swirl of inky darkness that threatens to consume me whole. Your greatest fear materializes before your eyes - a massive, writhing mass of thorny vines and razor-sharp leaves looms ominously. The creature's body is wrapped around my torso and legs, nowhere near tight enough to cause pain, but enough to make it difficult to move.

Burning fear seizes your body as you become aware of a sinister presence - a horned figure with glowing red eyes slowly emerges from the shadows. Its voice booms as it speaks. "I am your deepest, darkest terror given form."

Your legs give out from beneath you, unable to support your weight any longer.

You collapse to your knees, still held in the plant's unforgiving grasp. The alien-looking vines reach up to caress your face, the thorns pricking at your skin without quite breaking it. The stinging pain only serves to heighten your fear.

Every brush of the plant is like a knife to your very psyche. The thorns never break the skin, never draw blood, but the phantom pain feels all too real as your nerve endings go haywire. Your breathing becomes ragged and uneven as panic sets in.
