I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The air smells like rain-soaked cedar and burnt sugar, a contradiction that lingers in your throat, sweet and sharp. The forest around you pulses—not with life, but with light. Trees tower like cathedral spires, their bark iridescent, veins of liquid silver coursing through them. The ground beneath your feet is a tapestry of moss that hums, each tuft a tiny, glowing rune. Your friend stands at the center of this impossible landscape, but they are not quite themselves. Their silhouette is blurred at the edges, as if sketched in smoke, and their hands—when they gesture—are made of flickering fireflies. 

They turn to face you. Their voice is not theirs; it’s layered, a chorus of echoes. “You don’t have to follow the stars,” they say, but the words taste of static, and your pulse quickens. The trees lean in, leaves whispering in a language that scrapes your bones. Your friend laughs, a sound like wind through a hollow bone, and out of their sleeve slithers a creature—translucent, serpent-like, its body threaded with constellations. It coils around their wrist, and where it touches their skin, flowers bloom and wither in seconds. 

You want to ask them what’s wrong, but your throat is full of moth wings. Instead, you take a step forward, and the ground ripples like water. The serpent-creature hisses, its constellations dimming. Your friend’s eyes—*wrong now*, one a deep bruise-purple, the other a hollow black—lock onto yours. “Why do you cling to the familiar?” they ask, but their fingers are picking at the air, rearranging invisible threads that hang between the trees like spider silk. 

A part of you wants to run. Another part wants to unravel those threads, to trace the pattern. The forest grows colder. The runes underfoot dim. Suddenly, your friend’s form begins to dissolve—not melting, but *unspooling*, their atoms scattering like ash in a gust of wind that smells of ozone. The serpent-creature spirals upward, dissolving too, leaving only a single, iridescent feather floating where their hand had been.

**You wake** with the weight of that feather resting between your palms. The dream lingers, its symbols sharp and restless: the fractured voice, the unstable body, the threadbare edges of *normal*. Now you must choose how to step into the waking world to address the changes in your friend—those subtle shifts that even dreams magnify into something mythic. 

**How to move forward?**  

1. **The Threaded Approach**: Begin softly. Meet them in a place of shared calm—a park bench, a quiet café—where the air feels neutral. Let the conversation weave itself in fragments, like the threads in the dream. *“I noticed… something’s off. Not wrong, just… new.”* Let them lead, offering only your quiet presence until trust unfurls like a leaf from a bud.  

2. **The Mirror of Light and Shadow**: Acknowledge the surreal without overinterpreting. Share the dream, not as metaphor but as a mirror. *“You’ve been like the trees lately—so bright, but also… unreachable.”* Let them see their reflection in the imagery. Sometimes the surreal helps untangle the real.  

3. **The Offering of Fragile Things**: Bring something small but significant—a real feather, a stone with a hidden pattern—to symbolize the unspoken. Gifts can be bridges. Let the object speak where words falter. Let it mean *I notice, I’m here, whatever this becomes*.  

4. **The Dance of Shadows**: If they retreat, don’t corner. Offer a pact: *“We don’t have to solve this now. Just know I’m here, ready to walk through forests, even strange ones.”* Sometimes the safest path is to honor their rhythm first, letting trust build like mycelium beneath the surface.  

The dream doesn’t demand answers. It asks you to hold the paradox—to embrace the firefly hands and the dissolving form—and remember: even in the uncanny, connection is still possible. You are both still real. Start there.
