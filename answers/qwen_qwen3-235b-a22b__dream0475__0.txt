I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the electric tension of a storm that hasn’t yet broken. You stand at the edge of a labyrinth, its walls woven from obsidian shards and thorned vines that pulse like living things. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of bruised purples and smoldering golds, as though the universe itself is holding its breath. Somewhere deep in the maze, a clock ticks backward, each second unraveling the threads of certainty. You know—without knowing—this is where your fears live, coiled and waiting.  

You step forward, and the ground shifts beneath your feet. The path becomes a spiral staircase descending into a cavern lit by bioluminescent fungi, their glow a sickly green. Whispers slither from the walls: *“You’ll fail. You’ll drown. You’ll forget the words, the plan, your own name.”* The voices are familiar—echoes of your own mind, distorted into a chorus of dread. A mirror materializes, cracked and jagged, reflecting a thousand versions of yourself: one trembling before a faceless crowd, another sinking into quicksand, a third dissolving into smoke. You reach out, but the glass bleeds, smearing your fingertips with ink that seeps into your skin, forming words you can’t read.  

Then, a shift. The air thickens, and the labyrinth reshapes itself. You’re in a ballroom now, its chandeliers made of frozen fire. The floor is a chessboard where each square is a different nightmare—a gaping mouth, a pool of tar, a window into a memory you’ve buried. You step onto the board, and the pieces come alive: knights with skull-like helmets charge, rooks sprout claws, and the queen, a figure with your face but eyes like shattered mirrors, points a blade at your heart. *“Checkmate,”* she hisses, her voice a landslide.  

But here, in the dream, you remember something the waking world forgets: **you are both the player and the game.**  

You laugh—a raw, defiant sound—and the queen falters. The chessboard melts into a river, carrying the pieces away like fallen leaves. The labyrinth walls crumble into sand, revealing a forest of trees with roots in the clouds and branches clawing at the earth. You climb one, splinters of starlight embedding in your palms, until you reach the top. Below, the landscape writhes—a thousand catastrophic futures, all dissolving into mist.  

A moth lands on your shoulder, its wings etched with the very scenarios that haunt you. You stroke its fragile body, and it bursts into a constellation of fireflies, each light a single word: *“Breathe. Begin. Believe.”*  

The storm breaks. Rain falls in slow motion, each drop a prism refracting possibilities. You open your mouth to taste it, and the water becomes a song—a melody that stitches itself into a bridge stretching beyond the horizon. You walk, and with every step, the bridge rearranges itself into a staircase, then a glider, then a current of wind that lifts you higher.  

When you land, the labyrinth is gone. Only a single door remains, carved from petrified wood and humming with quiet power. You turn the handle, and behind it is not the catastrophe you feared, but a room bathed in dawnlight. On the table sits a cup of tea, steaming gently. A note reads: *“The future is not a monster. It’s a story you’re still writing.”*  

You wake with the taste of starlight and tea on your tongue, the weight of the dream lingering like a handprint on your chest—gentle, but unshakable.
