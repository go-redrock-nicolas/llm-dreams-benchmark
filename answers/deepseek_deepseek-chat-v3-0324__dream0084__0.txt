I am dreaming. The air hums as I raise my hands, fingertips tingling with unseen energy. A melody drifts from my lips—soft at first, a whisper of flutes and wind chimes—but the moment the sound touches the world, the ground beneath me shudders. Cracks split the pavement, not in destruction but in rebirth, as luminous vines erupt from the fissures, curling skyward in spirals of jade and gold. Their leaves shimmer like stained glass, casting prismatic hues that paint the air itself.  

I laugh, and the sound becomes a ripple of harp strings. The vibration travels outward, and the rigid brick walls of the alleyway peel back like petals, transforming into great, arched trees whose bark pulses with a slow, rhythmic glow. The stars above—are they stars?—they pulse in time with the song, swirling into constellations that twist and dance like fireflies caught in a celestial waltz.  

A low, resonant note pulses from my chest, and the pavement liquefies into a river of liquid silver, carrying floating lanterns shaped like blooming lotuses. They drift lazily, each one emitting a different chord, a symphony birthed from light itself.  

Then—a shift. The music grows wilder, a whirlwind of drums and soaring strings. The sky peels open like a vast scroll, revealing a second sun, this one cool and violet, its rays knitting new landscapes into existence. Mountains rise in the distance, their peaks crowned with luminous crystals that sing when the wind passes through them. The clouds above are soft, gelatinous—alive—murmuring harmonies that vibrate through my bones.  

A figure steps from the shimmering mist. They are made of shifting colors, a human-shaped aurora. Their voice entwines with mine, and the song deepens, turning the air thick and honeyed. Together, we sculpt the world anew—stone turns to water, water to light, and light into something beyond name.  

And then—  

A distant sound pulls at me. A voice, real and impatient. My eyelids flutter. The dream frays at the edges. But before it dissolves completely, I send out one last note—a promise, a secret—into the waking world, wondering if, just perhaps, the music will linger.
