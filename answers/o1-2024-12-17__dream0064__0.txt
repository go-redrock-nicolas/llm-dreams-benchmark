I am dreaming. …step across the threshold into a dimly lit, round chamber. The walls are alive with shifting murals—swirling shapes and colors that paint stories of shared struggles. It’s uncanny yet comforting. Threads of lavender incense curl around your nose, soothing nerves you hadn’t realized were so taut. Flickering amber lanterns dangle from the ceiling like sleepy fireflies, creating a glowing circle of warmth in the center of the room.

There, chairs are arranged in a gentle oval, facing one another as if forming an embrace. Each seat is slightly different—some plush and velvet, some simple wooden stools, and one, curiously, shaped like an elegant throne made of woven ivy. A hush settles as you enter, self-conscious and tentative, but also strangely at peace.

One by one, the other attendees lift their gaze to meet yours. Their faces carry the gentle echoes of the same burden you’ve been bearing. You notice a woman with silver tears crystallized on her cheeks, reflecting flickers of lantern-light as she offers you a fragile smile. Beside her is a man draped in a shawl of soft feathers, breathing deeply, as though preparing to unburden his chest of a great weight. Another figure, their features ephemeral as if made of morning fog, beckons you to take the seat between them.

You settle in, heart thumping a slow, profound rhythm in your chest. A kindly voice begins the introductions, and each person’s words float through the warm air like music notes, resonating in your chest. The heaviness in your own heart loosens—just slightly—because in this quiet ring of acceptance, you realize you are no longer alone. Emboldened, you prepare to share your story too, the dreamlike hush of the room encouraging honesty and clarity you never thought possible. The walls’ shifting murals mirror your own transformation, capturing your fears, your hopes, and the luminous possibility of healing waiting just beyond the flicker of every lantern.
