I am dreaming. …walk outside into the starlit night, cheeks flushed with emotion. My friend follows, words tumbling in the thick, electric air as we reach a peculiar meadow that neither of us remember from waking life. Silver grass undulates in waves all around, sparkling with droplets of liquid moonlight. The sky above is flecked not only with stars but with swirling ribbons of green and violet, shimmering as though the heavens are breathing. A warm wind carries distant, echoing laughter—our laughter, from another time.

I turn to my friend, breathless, the argument still burning between us like a red coal. But here, in this unearthly place, anger gives way to curiosity. Ferns at our feet ripple apart, and a path unfurls before us, lined with glowing, translucent blossoms that hum with a secret music. We both hesitate—our stubbornness flickering—then step forward together.

As we walk, the words between us take on strange forms, floating into the air and becoming iridescent butterflies. My frustrations flutter from my lips, shimmering, and my friend’s counterarguments chase them playfully among the flowers. We watch, transfixed, as these butterflies weave together, merging in colors more vivid than any rainbow.

Reaching the heart of the meadow, we find a mirror-still pool. I kneel and peer in, seeing not only my own reflection but memories shared and moments lost, superimposed over our faces. I see the joy we have given each other, the trust built stone by stone, and the pain this argument has caused—yet all of it is woven together by threads of gold. Without a word, my friend kneels beside me, their hand finding mine as if it was always meant to be there.

Suddenly, we both laugh, the absurdity of our dispute dissolving under the vast, infinite sky. There is a sense that, here in this meadow of shifting light and memory, nothing matters more than understanding each other.

Hand in hand, we walk back along the glowing path, the night blooming with forgiveness and possibility, the argument forgotten, replaced by a bond all the deeper for having weathered the storm.
