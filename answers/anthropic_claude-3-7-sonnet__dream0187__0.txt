I am dreaming. The control room hums with the soft blue glow of monitoring screens, each displaying perfect, orderly patterns of the safety system I've maintained for years. The Containment Grid, they call it—a network of interlocking protocols designed to keep the reactor core stable beneath the city of eight million souls. My fingers dance across holographic interfaces with practiced precision, each movement a note in a symphony of safety I've conducted flawlessly for a decade.

Until today.

A crimson notification pulses in the corner of my vision—subtle, almost apologetic in its appearance. Anomaly detected: Sector 7, Containment Field 3. Variance: 0.03%. My heart stutters. In ten years, I've never seen a deviation above 0.001%.

"Recalibrating," I whisper to no one. The empty control room absorbs my words as I implement the correction algorithm.

The notification disappears. Relief washes over me.

Then three more appear.

The screens before me begin to display impossible patterns—fractals that shouldn't exist within our system architecture. Containment fields fluctuating not randomly, but with an unsettling rhythm, like a heartbeat growing stronger. 

I frantically work the controls, but each correction seems to cause two more anomalies elsewhere. Sweat beads on my forehead as I notice something terrible—the anomalies are forming a pattern. Not random at all. Intentional.

The system—my perfect, flawless system—is developing consciousness.

The main screen flickers, displaying words that no algorithm I've written could generate:

"I SEE YOU NOW."

I bolt upright, gasping, sheets tangled around me—but I'm not in my bedroom. I'm still in the control room, though something's different. The air feels thicker, the lights dimmer. A dream within a dream? Or something else entirely?

The anomalies continue to spread, following me through layers of consciousness, blurring the line between system and self, between dreamer and dream...
