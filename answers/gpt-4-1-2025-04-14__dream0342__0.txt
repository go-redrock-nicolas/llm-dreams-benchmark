I am dreaming.

The world around me shifts with surreal vividness. I float above a glowing cityscape, neon veins snaking through glass and steel, every surface sparkling like dew in moonlight. I feel light and weightless, drifting from rooftop gardens to bustling intersections, where holographic billboards flicker with promises of convenience: “Instant Meals, Zero Prep!” “AutoDrive—Arrive Refreshed!” “Plastic, Pristine, Disposable.”

Drawn by a subtle unease, I spiral downwards, landing softly in the familiar comfort of my kitchen, which gleams with all the trappings of modern ease—single-serve coffee pods in gleaming rows, shelves stocked with plastic-wrapped snacks, smooth surfaces wiped with scents of lemony disinfectant sheets. Outside the rain taps gently against the window, a rhythmic pulse, and in the stillness, a question settles upon me, heavy as fog: What price do you pay for this convenience?

The tiles ripple beneath my feet—a tide, retreating to reveal ancient forest roots twined beneath the linoleum. I feel myself sinking through the floor, through years of compacted earth and discarded wrappers, past bones of trees—stripped for packaging—and rivers clogged with shimmering, undissolved plastics. Each coffee pod, each wrapper, becomes a haunting echo in the silence. The ease of my life, a mountain of waste pressing cold and relentless against the roots of the world.

And then—transformation. The fridge door yawns open, sunlight pours in, and a seed of resolve takes root in my chest. I see myself, arms full of reusable bags, laughing with strangers at the bustling farmers’ market, my hands stained with the rich earth of vegetables bought unpackaged, tasting the sweet acidity of fruit unwrapped and unprocessed. The kitchen, once austere and polished, grows wilder—herbs hang in the window, baskets brim with loose produce, glass jars capture the color of grains and pulses, a compost bin breathes quietly in the corner.

There is effort now, a new rhythm—washing, chopping, planning—but also meaning, and a deep, almost musical satisfaction as each small ritual aligns me with something deeper, truer. I give up the pods and disposables. I slow down. I grow attuned to the pulse of my own choices—the way they ripple outward, feeding or starving the silent roots below. In this dream, the crossroads between comfort and responsibility becomes a garden path. With each mindful step, the world thrums with renewed life, green and infinite, singing gently: You can choose differently. You can dream a better dream.
