I am dreaming. <placeholderno10>

I stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are made of smoke, their trunks swirling in hues of indigo and charcoal, dissolving upward into the twilight sky like ink spilled in water. The ground beneath me shifts between textures—smooth obsidian one moment, spongy moss the next—as though the earth itself can’t decide what shape to hold. A chorus of unfamiliar voices hums in the air, wordless but urgent, thrumming through my bones like the deep vibrations of a cello. Figures glide past, luminous and elongated, their faces flickering with constellations instead of features. 

One of them approaches, raising a hand that shimmers like molten glass. Their fingers unfold into branching fractals, each tip glowing with a different color, and suddenly I *understand*. The crimson tendril means *danger*. The cerulean spiral signifies *water*. They’re painting concepts in the air, weaving warnings and invitations without sound. I mimic the gesture, clumsily sprouting my own jagged, golden sparks from trembling fingertips. The beings tilt their starry faces, and a bridge of iridescent lichen unfurls beneath my feet, leading to a vast, pulsing tree whose roots drip liquid amber. The scent of burnt honey floods my lungs as I step forward—trusting the silence, speaking without speaking, lost and found in the grammar of light.
