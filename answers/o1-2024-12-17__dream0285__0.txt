I am dreaming. You find yourself seated at a long, curved table, surrounded by a dozen or so figures whose faces glide in and out of focus like reflections in shifting water. Overhead, a pale, rose-gold light filters through a glass ceiling dotted with swirling constellations. Beneath your fingertips is a smooth, shimmering surface pulsing with the faintest heartbeat, as though the table itself is alive. Everyone’s voices mesh into a low, resonant hum—like the hush of a distant ocean—and, strangely, you can taste the hush on your tongue, briny and electric.

In the dream, you realize you’re here for a grand debate, though you can’t quite remember the topic’s details. The swirling constellations overhead flicker with every word spoken, radiating a subtle glow whenever someone voices agreement. It’s obvious the group is in harmony about an important matter, but your intuition protests violently. Their logic, you suspect, is flawed. Yet, as you eyeball each speaker, you shrink in your seat, nearly drowning in the silence that clings to you like underwater pressure.

Your heart jitters like a trapped butterfly, and every moment of hesitation feels like stepping on eggshells laid across a crackling ice sheet—one misstep might send you plunging beneath. A voice in your mind screams for you to speak up, to push back, to voice the contradiction swirling in your head. Yet each time you open your mouth, only a squeak emerges. The group continues chatting in low, measured tones. Occasionally, a sparkle drifts from the constellations onto someone’s shoulder, as though praising their unified agreement.

Then, quite without warning, you notice a faint wisp of smoke swirling by your knee, a tendril that spirals upward around your torso. It seems to carry a peculiar warmth, urging you forward, gently pressing you to speak. You realize this smoky presence is your own unspoken belief, refusing to remain silent. It coils around your chest and settles near your throat, buzzing like a tiny, invisible hummingbird. You breathe in, slow and steady, inhaling the courage it offers.

Summoning everything you have, you stand. The metal legs of your chair scrape the floor with a clarion ring. The group falls silent—twelve pairs of eyes, resting upon you with an intensity that sends a flutter of golden motes swirling through the air. You take a moment to steady yourself, feeling the table’s soft throbbing beneath your fingertips.

“I have a different perspective,” you say at last. Initially, your voice wavers, sounding paper-thin. But the moment you speak, the swirling constellations overhead flare in a burst of iridescent starlight—acknowledging the courage that’s been locked inside you. The table’s heartbeat quickens beneath your palms, as if cheering you on, encouraging you to finish.

You explain your viewpoint, step by step, your words blossoming like ephemeral orchids across the shimmering tabletop. Emboldened, you lift your gaze. “I believe we’ve overlooked certain details,” you add. “We’ve grown so comfortable with a single idea that we’ve forgotten to question its roots.”

A series of small gasps ripples around the table. The eyes that once seemed hazy and unfriendly are now wide and intrigued, their surfaces bearing faint reflections of glimmering constellations. One of the figures shifts in their seat, fractal shadows dancing across their features, and with a nod, invites you to continue. And so, you do.

Your ideas fill the room with an otherworldly luminescence, as though each sentence weaves into a bright tapestry above the group. In the midst of that tapestry twinkling overhead, you notice stars rearranging themselves into new patterns, painting a different story across the glass ceiling. With every word, the smoky tendril around your neck grows warmer, ablaze with silent gratitude for being liberated from the prison of unspoken thoughts.

Finally, when you finish, a hush claims the discussion circle. Nobody moves, nobody speaks. It’s a gentle, reverent stillness. Then, the low hum returns, but it no longer sounds monolithic. It’s nuanced now—filled with the tenor of fresh perspectives, embroidered by threads of possibility.

In this moment, you feel heavier than before, grounded by honesty, and yet somehow lighter, lifted by relief. The entire space, from the shimmering table to the rose-gold light above, resonates with quiet affirmation. You exhale, tasting triumph like sweet, cool air on your tongue.

And then, the vision dissolves: the luminous figures become silhouettes, the swirling constellations fade, and you awaken with the serene realization that your own courage is a radiant force that even the most intimidating crowd cannot extinguish.
