I am dreaming. I am becoming aware that my usual patterns of expectation lead to unnecessary emotional turmoil. I resolve to be more open. The scene shifts to a surreal landscape.

The sky is a swirling blend of ink-blue and indigo, alive with celestial bodies that pulse like vast, glowing jellyfish. The moon is both crescent and full, phases overlapping like a Möbius strip of light. Beneath me, the ground isn't solid; it ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting the constellations above with each tiny tremor. Trees rise from this unstable floor, their trunks spiraling upward like helical towers made of intertwined glass strands, each one humming a low, resonant note that vibrates in my bones. Leaves are crystalline, shifting between see-through and opaque as if breathing. Birds with feathers of smoked quartz and copper traverse the air, leaving behind trails of shimmering stardust that settles like glittering spiderwebs between the trees.

Suddenly, a figure emerges: you, but younger, standing at the age of 14. Your hair is longer, windswept by a breeze that doesn’t exist in this dream-world. You smile at the past version, feeling a softness in your chest—a recognition of innocence and resilience.

"Tell me what you need," you both whisper in unison, voices harmonized by some dream-logic. 

The younger you steps forward. "I didn’t know how to stop the world back then," their voice wavers, "the panic, the fear—always imagining every worst-case future. You’d see my thoughts as storms, swirling ahead." 

You nod, understanding. "What you needed was someone to gently say… 'Not all paths lead to ruin.' But you had to learn that alone." 

The scene shifts: the horizon ripples like a wave, and you’re now standing on sand that shifts beneath your feet, but the sand is composed of countless tiny mirrored shards. Every step sends back a fragment of your face, each reflection showing a different version of yourself at different ages. Some laughing, others crying, all alive and moving independently. A wave approaches, but it's made of liquid light, cresting into prismatic arcs.

"You’re saying I still fear the storms," the younger version muses. "But perhaps storms only last as long as I give them room?" 

The present you offers a hand. "They’re not the enemy. They’re just weather. You survive them not by fighting but by… trusting the ground beneath you—the mercury, the shifting sand—they hold you whether you expect them to or not." 

Behind you, the trees morph into liquid, flowing toward the beach, their glass strands congealing into a bridge. It arches into the unknown, glowing with internal bioluminescence. 

Without another word, you walk toward it together. The path dissolves behind you into butterflies with wings like stained glass. 

The dream ends with a sound—not really a sound—the collective hum of all those glass trees, the pulse of the moons, the crystalline leaves—all merging into a single, vibrating note that feels like a promise.
