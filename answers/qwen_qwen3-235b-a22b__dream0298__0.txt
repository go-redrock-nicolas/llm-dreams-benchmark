I am dreaming.  

The world around me is a shifting tapestry of impossible things: a forest of trees with bark like molten glass, their branches dripping constellations into a sky that pulses indigo and gold. Beneath my feet, the ground is soft, alive—a carpet of moss that hums as I walk, each step sending ripples of cerulean light through the earth. I don’t question it. In dreams, we accept the logic of the impossible as gospel.  

But the strangeness isn’t what grips me. It’s the *feeling*.  

I’ve just made a mistake—a catastrophic one, though its shape is blurry, like a shadow cast by a forgotten fear. In waking life, this would unravel me. I’d carve myself open with criticism, replay the failure like a film on loop, let shame pool in my throat like bile. But here, in this luminous realm, something shifts.  

A voice—not external, but a resonance in my bones—says softly, *“Again.”*  

I turn, and the forest parts to reveal a stage suspended in the air, its surface a mirror of liquid mercury. The spotlight above is warm, not harsh, and in its glow, I see myself reenact the mistake. A stumble during a dance, a falter in a speech, a hand reaching for another that dissolves like smoke. The audience is a sea of faceless silhouettes, but their silence isn’t judgment—it’s stillness, like the hush before a storm.  

And then, the miracle: I feel it. A tenderness blooming in my chest, vast and unearned. My hands, trembling moments ago, still in the memory, steady. My breath slows. The voice returns, not scolding, not excusing, but *witnessing*. *“You tried. You are trying.”*  

The forest responds. The trees lean inward, their glowing branches weaving a canopy above my head, showering me with petals that dissolve into mist. The mist clings to my skin, cool and sweet as a benediction. I realize the mistake isn’t a stain here—it’s a thread in the tapestry, a note in the song. Imperfection isn’t a sin; it’s the rhythm of this place.  

A figure emerges from the shadows—a version of myself, but radiant, unbroken. Their eyes are twin galaxies, their skin etched with constellations. They don’t speak, only press a hand to my chest, where my heart thrums like a trapped bird learning to fly. In their touch, I feel the weight of every harsh word I’ve ever swallowed, dissolving into light.  

*“You are not a verdict,”* the dream whispers. *“You are a verb. A becoming.”*  

When I wake, the sensation lingers—a warmth in the hollow where self-loathing once nested. For the first time, I cradle my flaws like fireflies in cupped hands, their glow seeping through my fingers. The dream’s mercy clings to me, a reminder that even in the waking world, kindness can be a choice—and sometimes, the softest choices carve the deepest truths.
