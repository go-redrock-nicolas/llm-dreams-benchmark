I am dreaming. …take a single lucid breath and let the dream paint itself around me:

I stand on a shoreline made of mirrors instead of sand. Each mirrored shard is warm to the touch, reflecting not the violet twilight above but the private weather of my own psyche—storm-cloud thoughts, stray sunbeams of compassion, flickers of envy that hiss like small green sparks. When I lift my eyes, the sea is a liquid sky: clouds swim beneath transparent waves, constellations flash like silver fish.

A parade approaches along the mirrored beach. Every marcher is someone I know—or think I know—yet their faces shimmer, rippling between the familiar and the utterly strange.

First comes the Braggart, draped in peacock feathers that chime like brass bells. He shouts his victories so loudly that gulls drop from the air, stunned by the volume. I feel an old flick of irritation: Why must he announce himself so relentlessly? In the next heartbeat, the mirrored sand flashes a confession—my own unspoken wish to be loudly praised. The moment I acknowledge it—yes, I, too, want that thunderous applause—the Braggart softens, feathers molt into quiet grey down, and he steps aside.

Next rolls in the Sloth, reclining on a velvet chaise that floats just above the ground, pushed by invisible hands. She yawns, eyes half-lidded, indifferent to the shimmering spectacle around her. “How lazy,” I mutter, “how careless.” Mirrors at my feet flare with images of the nights I scroll endlessly, the mornings I tap snooze like it’s Morse code. Shame prickles. “I see you,” I whisper—to her, to me. A breeze lifts; the chaise transforms into a cloud shaped like an open palm, offering rest instead of judgment. She smiles, drifts away.

Anxious chatter rises—the Critic arrives, wearing a suit stitched from ripped report cards, every seam inked with red pen. He points at me with quivering fingers. “Not good enough—not yet, not ever!” The familiar blade of self-doubt glitters. My pulse catches. But the mirrors beneath show the small child version of me building impossible towers of blocks, laughing each time they topple. “Perfection never mattered,” the child says without sound. I kneel, reach for him. The Critic’s suit unthreads into lengths of soft silk, turning into ribbons that dance on a wind only it can feel.

Now the beach falls silent. Only one figure remains, back turned, gazing at the upside-down constellations in the water. I recognize the posture before the face: it is Me, or rather the Me I refuse to look at—the collector of all hidden traits I reject. She turns, and her eyes are galaxies, each swirling with every disowned fragment: vanity, laziness, ambition, tenderness, fear, lust, brilliance.

“Name us,” she says, voice echoing like flutes in a cavern.

One by one I speak the names aloud. With each word a mirrored shard rises from the beach and hovers in the air, glowing like stained glass. When the last name leaves my tongue, the shards whirl around the two of us, fuse into a magnificent mosaic sphere that pulses with warm light.

She steps forward and merges with me. There is no pain—only a deep settling, like a book closing on the final page of a perfect chapter. The mosaic sphere contracts, becomes a gemstone at my heart: equal parts shadow and shine, whole.

The sky-sea rolls back, revealing a staircase made of moonlight that climbs past the horizon. I place my bare foot on the first step. The gemstone flickers once, twice, then steadies—an inner lighthouse.

I ascend, no longer judging the parade or myself, but carrying us all upward toward the next mystery the dream is eager to unveil.

Somewhere beyond, I hear the quiet applause of all the traits, finally welcomed home.
