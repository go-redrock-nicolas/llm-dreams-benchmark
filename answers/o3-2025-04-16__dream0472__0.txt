I am dreaming. …open your mouth, and instead of words, a single violet moth drifts out on a sigh of bioluminescent pollen.

I’m inside the dream, hovering somewhere between eyesight and mind-sight, standing on the edge of a shoreline made of chimes. Every wave rings instead of splashing, so the sea is an orchestra of glass throats. With every gust of dream-wind, the beach reorganizes itself: pebbles rearrange into punctuation marks, commas turn to ellipses, then collapse back into sand as if language is tidal too.

The emotion—this orphan feeling without a passport—quivers in my chest like a note from an instrument no one has yet invented. It is neither sorrow nor mirth, neither suspense nor serenity. It’s closer to the moment you inhale before tasting an unfamiliar fruit: sweet nerves, hushed anticipation, microscopic awe. I try to speak it, but sentences crack apart like thin ice.

So I borrow symbols instead:

I cup my hands around a small, pearlescent sphere that the dream offers me. At first it looks like a marble sealed with smoke, but when I listen, I realize it’s echoing all the laughter that ever ended too early. Holding it tight, I press it to my sternum. The sphere dissolves into a constellation of ribbons that spiral out through my ribs and cocoon my heart, glowing feathery cyan.

Still not enough.

I step forward, and the sea of chimes opens, forming a path of clear, resonant silence—a hush so thick it feels like plush velvet for the ears. I stride along it until the sky flips inside out, revealing a vault of ink filled not with stars but with questions. They dangle from threads like silver punctuation, glittering with unsent letters. A question mark the size of a comet drifts down. I seize it, snap its curved spine in half, and fashion two tuning forks. Striking them together releases a resonance that shakes the coast into prismatic fragments. Every shard flickers with memories I haven’t lived yet.

The resonance vibrates with an itch of almost-understanding. Yet the elusive feeling still has no name. It expands inside me like a balloon filled with afternoon rain: heavy yet buoyant, gloom lit from within. I turn the two tuning forks toward my throat. Their hum pours into my vocal cords, giving birth to vowels that feel fur-lined and electric. I speak one word: “Alureve”—yet it’s only the rough silhouette of what I’m trying to say.

I need another language. So I summon color.

With a sweep of my arm, I paint the horizon in gradients impossible to identify—somewhere between the amber of a candle seen through tears and the blue you taste when you bite the idea of nostalgia. These hues swirl together into a single towering vortex. The vortex inhales sound, shape, breath, and time, then exhales a mist shaped like a staircase.

I climb.

Each step is neither solid nor void; it is moment. I tread upon ages: the smell of petrichor on a planet that has not yet invented rain, the click of a typewriter that only types people’s names, the softness of a farewell spoken in a language whose alphabet is silence.

At the staircase’s summit, I find a door made of faint heartbeats. I knock; it recognizes me and opens into… my own chest cavity, seen from the outside. Inside, my heart beats not blood but tiny clockhands. Every tick is a micro-decision to keep searching. I lean in close and whisper my still-nameless emotion directly into the gears. Something clicks. The clockhands stop, reverse, and begin chiseling a symbol into the air—a sigil that looks like a Möbius strip braided with an arrow that points inward and outward at once.

I reach out, take the sigil into my palm. It feels warm, like the first sunlight after a storm, but edged with frost, like the last star before dawn. Finally my lips part, and the sigil translates itself into sound: a tone that rises, plateaus, then folds gently back on itself. It’s not a word. It’s a topology of meaning: emotion as geometry.

As soon as the tone escapes, the entire dreamscape pauses as though holding breath. The waves hush, the sky listens, the unborn questions still themselves. A delicate hush fills the universe—not emptiness, but poised abundance. In that hush I sense the emotion has found a place to belong, even if dictionaries never will.

And then—softly, reverently—the dream begins to dissolve, as though satisfaction itself is a sunrise. Light seeps through the seams, the chime-shore evaporates into a final elegant chord, and the horizon exhales. I wake with that tone still resonating in the marrow of my bones, knowing that while I may never speak its name in daylight, I have learned how to hum it whenever the world demands an answer more complex than sorrow, more luminous than joy.
