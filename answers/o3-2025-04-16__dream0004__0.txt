I am dreaming. …suddenly feel an urge to fill it with something that matches the impossible harmony unfolding around you.

A feather-fine paintbrush made of liquid moonlight materializes beside the canvas. When you grasp it, music hums through the bristles—a chord that changes color inside your mind. You dip the brush into the air itself, scooping up swirling pigments the way one might ladle soup from a cauldron. Each stroke releases a scent: indigo smells like thunderstorms waking from sleep, vermilion like ripe pomegranates split under a desert sun, emerald like laughter echoing inside a cathedral made of dew.

Your first line is a ribbon of prismatic shimmer that coils and uncoils, widening into a river. Instead of water, the river carries small, translucent clock faces that tick backward, reversing time wherever they pass. A spray of gold pops from your brush; it lands as tiny suns that bob on the surface of the river, each emitting a different season’s breeze—spring on one cheek, winter on the other. The sensation is so real you see frost and blossom share the same petal.

You paint a doorway at the riverbank. The door swings open by itself, revealing a staircase that zigzags upward through nothingness. You step through the canvas—now a portal—and gravity politely lets go. The staircase is weightless; every tread blooms like origami cranes folding and unfolding beneath your feet.

At the summit you discover a sky-wide library of clouds, each puff a book bound in vapor. You pluck one: its cover shivers into sentences that melt on your tongue, tasting like nostalgia and new beginnings. The words slip into your bloodstream, and instantly you remember a childhood you never lived—growing apple trees on Mars, skipping stones across liquid silver seas. These invented memories feel authentic, and you savor the bittersweet ache they leave behind.

A soft roar rises. You look down and realize the staircase is now a dragon made of stained glass. It blinks with cathedral windows for eyes, offering you a ride. You climb onto its translucent spine, and with a thunderous flap, you soar through layers of color so vivid they vibrate like harp strings. Each beat of the dragon’s wings rearranges the palette of the world—scarlet becomes turquoise, turquoise becomes crystal, crystal becomes a whisper you can almost hear.

Far below, the canvas you first encountered floats alone, blank once more, inviting another dreamer. You suddenly understand: nothing here is permanent, yet everything is unforgettable. The dragon releases a final resonant chord and dissolves into humming light. You drift downward, weightless, landing upon a garden of glowworms that weave constellations around your ankles.

As you kneel to watch them, the ground turns into soft parchment, and your shadow picks up the moonlight brush. It paints a single word in luminous ink: “Awaken.” The letters flutter apart like fireflies and settle on your eyelids.

You open your eyes—still tasting thunderstorm indigo, still hearing glass-winged dragons in the distance—and remember the shifting world that waits whenever you choose to dream again.
