I am dreaming. I find myself dreading an upcoming social event despite knowing these gatherings usually end up being enjoyable.  Investigating this anticipatory anxiety, I discover that it is rooted in a fear of judgment and rejection by others.  This fear stems from my insecurities about my appearance, personality, and opinions.  It also arises from my sensitivity to criticism and hurtful comments.  It intensifies when I compare myself with the idealized images of perfection and popularity that surround me.
I realize that this fear is irrational and unproductive.  It blinds me from seeing the positive aspects of socializing such as making new friends, learning about different perspectives, and sharing my passions with others.  It isolates me from experiencing the joy and fulfillment that come from connecting with people on a deeper level.
Determined to overcome this fear, I decide to confront it head-on by attending the social event with confidence and curiosity instead of apprehension and defensiveness.
As I wake up from my dream, I feel inspired by my own courage and resilience.  I resolve to continue this inner journey of self-discovery and growth until I can fully embrace myself as I am without any reservations or regrets.
Good morning Sydney!
