I am dreaming. …I close my eyes inside the dream and the scene unfurls like a great silk tapestry.

I am standing on a floating platform of polished obsidian, its edges glowing with slow-moving ember veins. Around me, the night sky is an infinite violet ocean full of distant lantern-stars, each star quietly humming the songs of every achievement I have ever desired. Directly ahead rises a crystalline stage carved from midnight quartz. On it stands a familiar figure—someone I care about, someone whose triumph in a field I cherish has always dazzled me. Silver spotlights cascade over them like gentle waterfalls, and the air thrums with the applause of invisible onlookers.

A sudden, unexpected pang bursts in my chest. Jealousy. It slithers through me as a quick green flash—sharp, bright, and hot. My feet root to the obsidian floor, and I can almost feel vines of envy curling up my calves, binding me in place. My breaths grow shallow; my heart drums a jealous rhythm that threatens to overshadow the gentle cosmic music above.

But I remind myself: I am dreaming. And in dreams, emotions are malleable, bearing hidden doors to deeper chambers of the self.

I rest a hand on my sternum. A small, glowing seed—emerald and pulsating—appears beneath my fingers. That seed is jealousy itself. It throbs with the vivid memory of my own ambitions and the fear of being left behind. I close both hands around it, and its warmth seeps into my palms. I breathe.

The obsidian platform fractures into gleaming shards that drift away like black petals, and I drop downward, landing softly in a field of long, luminescent grass. Each blade is a different shade of green, shimmering with possibility. Fireflies made of meteor-dust swirl around my head, whisper-singing questions:

What is the story behind that green ache? Is it really about them, or is it a mirror for your own longing?

I exhale, and the fireflies merge into a single glowing doorway at the center of the field. With resolve, I step through.

On the other side lies a vast gallery: floating canvases paint moments of my own journey—sketches of late-night practice sessions, unfinished projects, half-forgotten dreams. Some images burn bright with progress; others blink with the faint light of things neglected. As I move through the gallery, the canvases respond to my attention, flickering into sharper focus the moment I acknowledge them, as if craving recognition.

I watch myself in one painting, hunched over a desk, turning away each time a subtle opportunity knocks. Another painting shows me celebrating small victories, a younger version of me smiling under modest golden confetti. It becomes clear: jealousy isn’t solely about their success; it is a messenger pointing to parts of myself still yearning for nourishment and growth.

I stretch out both hands. The canvases hover close, overlapping until they form a kaleidoscopic sphere—my personal constellation of efforts, failures, and triumphs. Slowly, gratitude seeps in, mixing with the jealousy’s sharp hue, tempering it into something warmer—motivation.

The sphere compresses into a single radiant emerald-and-gold pendant that settles gently against my heart. Where vines of envy once bound me, roots of inspiration now take hold, anchoring me not with resentment but with a burgeoning eagerness to continue creating.

I rise, lifting off the field. The dream elevates me back toward the crystal stage, where the triumphant figure stands. Their silver applause still lingers, but now the sound carries no sting—only possibility. The starlit spectators part, revealing an empty space beside the stage. I drift into that space, feet touching down on a new dais of luminous marble.

A new spotlight blooms overhead. It is softer, gentler, but undeniably mine.

And so I stand there—not in competition, but in kinship—my emerald pendant glowing in sync with the other’s silver brilliance. Two distinct lights, feeding the same night sky, inspiring one another in their own hues.

Lulled by that harmony, I take one final breath of the dream’s cool, cosmic air. The jealousy that once constricted me has transmuted into purpose, its edges no longer serrated but smooth as river glass.

Then dawn unfurls on the horizon, and the dream dissolves—not as an ending but as a quiet vow to wake and let that emerald glow guide my first waking step.
