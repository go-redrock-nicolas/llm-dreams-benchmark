I am dreaming. As I delve deeper into the dream, I find myself standing in an expansive chamber hewn from ancient stone. The walls are lined with a series of ornate pillars, their surfaces covered in intricate carvings that seem to dance in the flickering light cast by sputtering torches.

Before me stands a massive stone altar, its surface etched with an elaborate riddle in a language I've never seen before. The symbols writhe and twist, appearing almost three-dimensional despite being carved into the flat stone. I can feel an ancient power emanating from the altar, as if the very stones are vibrating with hidden knowledge.

As I move closer to examine the riddle, the symbols seem to shift slightly, rearranging themselves before settling back into their original positions. I notice that each character casts a tiny shadow, even though there is no obvious light source to create such an effect. The shadows appear to be moving independently of the torchlight in the chamber.

I reach out my hand to touch the stone, and as soon as my fingers make contact, the entire chamber grows much brighter. The pillars seem to pulse with a soft, ethereal glow, and a low hum vibrates through the air.

The riddle on the altar begins to glow with an inner light, and each symbol starts to take on a different hue. Red, blue, green, and yellow light dance across the carvings, forming a complex pattern that seems to be a code within a code. I find myself captivated by the display, and my mind feels stretched to its limits as I try to decipher its meaning.
