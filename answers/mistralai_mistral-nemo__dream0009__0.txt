I am dreaming. I find myself in a bed that is not my own, surrounded by heavy velvet curtains as deep as a midnight sky. I stretch my limbs, my hands brushing against fabric that is rich, yet lavish. I toss the blanket aside and step onto cool, stone floors, intricately patterned and worn smooth by time.

The room is dimly lit by flickering candles in iron sconces, their golden light dancing on the walls, adorned with paintings of stern-faced nobility and sweeping landscapes. A large, four-poster bed dominates the room, draped in more heavy fabric, and beside it, a grand wardrobe carves out of dark wood stands proudly.

I drag my feet to the window, the cold nipping at my toes. I push aside the heavy drapes and gaze out at a bustling cityscape that could have been plucked straight from the pages of a storybook. Cobblestone streets glisten with moisture under the pale light of an overcast sky. Horse-drawn carriages rumble past, their hooves clattering on the stones, while people in period attire hurry about their daily business. The air is filled with the scent of damp earth, smoke, and the tantalizing aroma of fresh bread wafting from a nearby bakery.

I turn away from the window, my eyes landing on a full-length mirror propped against the wall. Reflected back at me is not my usual appearance. I am clad in a dress, rich blue in color, with intricate embroidery and lace details. The bodice is tight, cinching my waist, and the skirt rustles as I turn, the petticoats beneath swishing softly. My hair, unbound, cascades down my back in loose waves, a stark contrast to the intricate updos I usually favor.

A knock at the door startles me, and I turn to see a young woman, her cheeks flushed, curtseying nervously. "M'lady," she greets, "I've brought your breakfast. I thought you'd be waking soon."

She sets a tray down on the table by the window, and I approach, my stomach rumbling at the sight of steaming porridge, fresh fruit, and strong tea. As I sit down, I notice a small, intricately crafted letter opener lying beside the tray. It's clear this is not a place I've been before, this is not my time. But I feel a strange sense of belonging, a curiosity piqued by the mystery of this new world. I pick up the letter opener, its cool, metallic weight grounding me as I take my first sip of tea, the hot, bitter liquid swirling in my mouth like a promise of adventures yet to come.
