I am dreaming.

I open my eyes in the sky—literally—because the floor is a pane of crystal no thicker than a soap bubble, and beneath it is a cloudscape rolling like a white ocean. I’m standing at the very heart of the Aerial Convocation Hall, a colossal amphitheater that drifts above the city on silent turbines and shimmering silver balloons. It’s the kind of venue people sketch on cocktail napkins but never expect to build. And I am the principal coordinator of the Great Alignment Ceremony, the once-in-a-generation gathering meant to bring together every nation, guild, and sky-borne tribe in an attempt to sign a single treaty of peace. If I succeed, decades of conflict may dissolve overnight. If I fail, warships will cut through these same clouds by dawn.

For months the plan has unfolded like a celestial choreography: ambassadors traveling by iridescent airships, orchestras recruited from rival states, luminescent petals set to fall in slow motion once the treaty is signed. But in dream logic, perfection begins to fracture about twenty-four hours before the opening note.

The first tremor of trouble: an elegant line of clockwork swans—programmed to glide along a spiral canal to deliver the official scroll—suddenly seize up. They freeze with wings half-unfurled, necks crooked, their gears grinding like distant thunder. I send a frantic message to the mechanical artisans, yet the pneumatic tubes that ferry the messages spit my parchment back out, edges singed as if it passed through a solar flare rather than a mail chute. 

I hurry to the gallery of lighting engineers where chandeliers made of condensed starlight should be staging their final test. Instead, the lights flicker off, then flare on again but with a sickly green cast that makes dignitaries’ faces resemble lizards. Someone mutters about a rogue cosmic ray storm interfering with the photon stabilizers. I slap the emergency glyph—a glowing red rune labeled “Recalibrate to Dawnlight.” It sputters. Sparks drip upward into the rafters like molten fireflies, missing each gemstone receptor by fractions of an inch.

I fly—well, half-glide—down a translucent staircase that curves outside the hull, buffeted by wind, to inspect the floral levitation arrays. These are supposed to loft five thousand chrome-painted magnolia blossoms at the precise moment an asteroid passes overhead, causing an iridescent halo. Instead, the flowers hover only a foot off the ground, then drop, then bounce upward like popcorn. A horticultural drone frantically tries to herd petals back into order, its voice squeaking, “Trajectory compromised, trajectory compromised,” before shorting out in a shower of rose-gold pollen.

Stress burrows into my bones like cold iron, but I remind myself: everything is solvable in dreams if you swim with the current. I pivot, issuing commands that sound like poetry:

“Redirect the aurora prisms to the east balustrade; they can mask the faulty chandeliers. Swap the clockwork swans for phoenix couriers—they never freeze, merely combust, and that’s always impressive. Call the meteorologist-monks: we need a lullaby of pressure domes to keep those petals afloat….”

Yet the deeper I wade into solutions, the more reality warps. The marble columns surrounding the grand dais begin to weep viscous ink. It seeps across the floor, swallowing my reflection so I appear headless in the mire. A disembodied voice—familiar, like a childhood friend turned accusatory—whispers, “If you let them down, everything flies apart.”

I break into a run. The Hall’s architecture warps into a Möbius strip; I ascend a staircase that circles back beneath itself. Midway, I meet a version of me running the opposite direction, face pale, carrying a clipboard where every page reads only: “You are too late.” I shout at my duplicate, “Rewrite the schedule,” but she dissolves into a flock of parchment cranes that beat their wings and vanish into ventilation vents.

Adrenaline turns the dream lucid. I realize I can bend it, but only if I stay calm. So I still my breath and extend both palms. The ink recedes, the chandeliers steady. Good. I remember a piece of advice my grandmother once murmured over hot cocoa: “When nightmares corner you, invite them to dance.”

So I invite the failures.

I call the malfunctioning gears, runaway photons, wilting flowers, and rogue timelines to gather around the central platform. They swirl toward me as if sucked into gravity. Each problem coalesces into a personified form: the green light becomes a glimmering child clutching broken sunbeams; the clockwork jams manifest as a hunched, rust-flecked smith; the anxious timetable transforms into that pale duplicate of me, but calmer now, clipboard tucked beneath her arm.

I bow to them and declare, “Join the ceremony. You aren’t errors—you’re uninvited guests.” They look stunned, but they follow. The rust-flecked smith pulls a pin from his beard—an impossibly fine gear. He flicks it into the starlight chandelier, and suddenly the green tinge refracts into a shimmering emerald Aurora that ripples in perfect coordination with the music. The flower-petal wind sprite—small, translucent, wings thrumming—cups her hands and exhales; the magnolia blossoms rise smoothly, spiraling in luminous helixes. My clipboard twin rewrites the timeline in flowing silver ink, and every crossed-out failure reappears as a triumph:

“19:32—Clockwork phoenixes deliver treaty scroll in a blaze of saffron feathers, scattering sparks like celebratory confetti.”

“19:45—Emerald Aurora curtains frame dais, symbolizing unity between rival factions.”

“20:00—Magnolia helix ascends, reflecting starlight into the eyes of every delegate.”

At last, night falls and the moment arrives. Ambassadors float in on petals of compressed air. Chimera musicians tune instruments made of coral and lightning. My heart drums like a timpani while the treaty—its parchment the hue of dawn’s first sigh—rests on the crystal lectern.

Did I invite all the potential catastrophes, or did they invite me? Either way, they stand behind me now. The rust-specked smith tips his cap, the green-light child beams, my clipboard twin nods. We breathe together. I raise my hands, and all the improbable portions of the Hall—columns, chandeliers, hovering petals—harmonize into one trembling chord of light. 

The delegates sign the treaty in luminous ink that hovers above the page before soaking in like dew. An exhale passes through the Hall: relief, hope, awe. Outside, fighter zeppelins that had been circling just beyond the cloud line shut down their engines and glide away, peaceful silhouettes against the moon.

I clutch the new timeline to my chest. It’s still warm. As applause rises to meet the heavens, I feel the Hall tilt gently, like a lullaby cradle. The ink that once threatened to drown me has become constellations, winking from the ceiling. I realize I’m not falling apart; I’m orchestrating a tapestry woven from every frayed thread.

And then the dream ebbs. I feel the crystal floor melt into morning sunlight. Awake, I carry only the faintest memory of emerald light, magnolias in orbit, and a single thought etched like starlight on my ribs: Even failures can be invited to dance—and when they do, they might just bring the celebration to life.
