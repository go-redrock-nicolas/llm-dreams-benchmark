I am dreaming.

It begins not with a sound, but with a scent—the air shivers with the fragrance of rain on wild flowers, dew pooling on silvered leaves. I stand barefoot in a vast, luminescent forest, where the trunks of ancient trees sweep high and fold into themselves, their bark inscribed with delicate glowing runes that pulse with secret meaning. Shafts of indigo twilight stream through the canopy, glinting off the wings of spectral moths spiraling in slow, hypnotic dances above my head.

The ground beneath my feet is soft with emerald moss. Shadows ripple at the edges of my vision, yet they do not threaten—they beckon me deeper. I follow a winding trail threaded with blue fireflies, whose gentle voices whisper memories I have yet to live. Each step echoes a note, and soon my footprints hum with melody, weaving a symphony of longing and discovery through the undergrowth.

A lake appears, perfectly still, its surface reflecting the aurora swirling overhead—a kaleidoscope of colors unknown to the waking world. As I kneel beside the water, the reflection stirs: my own face transforms into the faces of friends and strangers, loved ones and forgotten rivals. With every flutter of color, I feel their hopes, regrets, and joys blooming inside my heart. I realize my subconscious is weaving a tapestry of connection—it is urging me to understand how the threads of my life intertwine with so many others, seen and unseen.

Suddenly, from the heart of the lake, a great tree bursts forth—a colossal willow with silver leaves, branching into infinity. Its roots sink deep into the water, and its crown tangles with the very stars. Shapes emerge within the branches: the echo of a childhood room, a long-wandered city street at night, the open arms of someone I loved and lost. I hear a distant music, not from this world, and I understand: every dream, every vivid vision, is a summons toward self-discovery. My subconscious invites me to witness my own mysteries, to decipher the connections that ripple beneath the surface of my waking life.

The wind rustles, carrying a single word—“Remember”—and suddenly the dream feels both endless and delicately finite, as though time itself is a bird poised to take flight from my open palm. The scene dims, colors retreating like the tide, yet the sensation lingers—a warm, electric thrum through my body—reminding me that I am part of something vaster, older, always waiting to be remembered.

I wake, heart full, carrying fragments of silver leaves and violet skies, a secret melody echoing softly, softly, in the hidden chambers of my mind.
