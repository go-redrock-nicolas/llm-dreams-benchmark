I am dreaming. My breath fogs the air, each exhale dissapating into the cold, amorphous space around me. The ground, if it exists, is unseen beneath thick tendrils of mist that coil around my ankles like spectral serpents. There's a faint hum here, an almost sub-audible vibration that seems to emanate from the walls I can't see. 

My fingers brush against something solid—a stone ledge in the haze. On it rests a silver key, pitted with age, its teeth twisted into odd angles. But when I lift it, the metal warms with a slow pulse, like a heartbeat. 

Sound snaps my head left—the metallic scrape of chains. A shadow shifts beyond the mist. Not human. Not animal. Seven points of amber light hover where a face might be. 

"Parallax," the thing croons, syllables clicking like a clockwork crow. "Your memories are fractals. You broke the mirrors."

Behind me, bookshelves materialize in staggered fragments—obsolete encyclopedias, water-damaged photo albums spilling curls of faces I almost recognize. Dusty hourglasses embedded in the shelves now drip black sand upward. 

The key's pulse quickens. 

The creature's voice splinters into overlapping echoes, each word a shard: "Find the obol where the swan drowns. Burn the—"

An alarm blares. My bedroom ceiling swims into view. But in that final flicker of the dream, I taste copper and wet feathers.
In the dream’s lingering twilight, I stumble forward, the key’s pulse syncing with the frantic rhythm of my heart. The mist thickens, congealing into walls lined with cracked mirrors. Each fractured pane reflects not my face, but disjointed scenes: a childhood birthday party flickering in sepia, a door ajar in a rain-soaked alley, a handwritten letter dissolving into ash. My breath hitches—these are *my* memories, yet twisted, their edges blurred like smudged charcoal.  

The creature’s chains clank again, closer now. Those amber eyes pierce the haze, glowing like poisoned honey. “You buried the obol,” it hisses, the sound ricocheting off the mirrors. A dozen distorted voices surge from the glass—friends, strangers, their words tangling: *“You weren’t there.” “The sky was green.” “You let go first.”*  

I clutch the key tighter, its heat searing my palm. The shelves shift, books warping into birdcages filled with moths beating wings in Morse code. *Tap-tap. Tap-tap-tap.* One cage cracks open, releasing a moth with iridescent scales that paint fleeting images in the air—a swan sinking in a black lake, its neck arched in silent protest.  

Suddenly, the floor liquefies. I plunge into frigid water, the key glowing like a drowned star. The swan’s corpse floats past, a silver coin gleaming in its beak. As I reach for it, the creature’s laugh gurgles through the depths, chains morphing into kelp that binds my ankles. *“Burning cleans nothing,”* it bubbles. *“Only the drowned remember.”*  

The alarm shreds the dream. I surface gasping, my sheets damp, the taste of the lake still bitter on my tongue. But on my nightstand, half-hidden beneath my phone, a single moth wing trembles—iridescent, fragile, and impossibly real.
