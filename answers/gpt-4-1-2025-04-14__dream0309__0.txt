I am dreaming. I find myself drifting in a gleaming city suspended between moonbeams and clouds, every skyscraper a cathedral to perseverance, its glass windows aglow with the light of countless, unseen midnight hours. Gentle winds carry the distant echo of my laughter and struggles—that tapestry of effort woven into every brick and shimmering reflection.

I stroll down a broad avenue that shivers with possibility—boulevards lined with bronze statues looking suspiciously like blurred versions of myself: one gripping a diploma, another grasping the hilt of a pen, their faces etched with both fatigue and pride. Every step I take feels buoyant, as if the pavement itself remembers the miles I trudged in waking life.

Suddenly, the sun flickers. There’s a figure at the corner—clad in garments stitched from fortune cookies and four-leaf clovers, their gaze sharp, their smile sly. They beckon me closer with a sweep of the hand. As I approach, the world seems to warp, edges softening, colors rippling like water. This figure speaks with a voice that seems to come from everywhere at once—a melody both sweet and biting, echoing long after each word dissipates:

“Is all this truly yours—these luminous heights, these accolades? Or have serendipity’s fingers molded your path as much as your will?”

The accusation shivers up my spine, unsettling, dizzying. I feel the twin weights of justice and doubt pressing upon my chest. My hands remember blistering work: endless late-night study, poured-over pages, choices wrestled from uncertainty. Yet, flickering in the recesses of memory, I also glimpse crossroads: a kind teacher, a lucky break, a moment where a door stood open for no obvious reason.

Blooms of ambivalence unfurl in my heart. Around me, the dream morphs: my bronze statues begin to shift, their metal faces splitting to reveal gears and spinning dice within, ticking and rolling without pattern or purpose. I gasp, shaking, as streetlamps flicker, showering the avenue with light and shadow in equal measure.

I stand there—confronted, humbled, but not broken. My voice, raw and true, cracks the buzzing air. “I built much of what you see,” I say, “brick by brick, choice by choice! But I do not deny the hidden currents, the strokes of luck, the intersections of chance and persistence.”

Slowly, the figure’s inscrutable smile softens. The city stabilizes, statues gleaming anew—only now, their shadows are twined with mine, inseparable. Above us, the moon leans closer, honeyed and enormous, its glow a gentle benediction.

In this twilight between certainty and chaos, I awaken to a deeper humility—my accomplishments gilded not only by sweat and resolve, but by the gossamer threads of fortune that hem the edges of every great tale.
