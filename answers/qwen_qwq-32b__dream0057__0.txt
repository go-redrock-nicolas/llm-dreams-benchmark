I am dreaming. I imagine myself standing in a twilight meadow, the sky a swirl of violets and ambers. The ground beneath me is spongy with moss, dotted with glowing, bioluminescent flowers that pulse softly in time with an unheard rhythm. To my left, a figure emerges—a woman with skin like polished onyx and eyes that hold galaxies. She wears armor forged from starlight, every plate whispering ancient secrets. At her side hangs a sword which hums a lullaby of forgotten wars. 

To my right, another form materializes: a man with bark-like skin and roots coiling from his boots into the earth. His beard is a cascade of ivy, and his hair streams like living wildfires. He carries an axe whose blade is a miniature supernova, crackling with energy that threatens to consume the air. The ground trembles slightly at his approach, and the very flowers dim where his shadow falls. 

They face each other, the tension between them like a plucked bowstring. The woman speaks first, her voice a chorus of whispers carried on the wind: *“You see the truth now, don’t you? The Forest’s corruption poisons the root of our alliance. Only by severing it can we preserve the stars!”* Her sword lights brighter, casting jagged shadows. 

The man’s reply booms like thunder through hollow trees: *“And your 'preservation’ is but a funeral pyre for life itself! The Celestial Brotherhood seeks to clip wings it fears—to cage what it cannot control.”* His axe flares, and the air shimmers as if the very cosmos respires in response. 

Both pairs of eyes fixate on me. The woman steps forward, starlight spilling from her fingertips. *“Join us,”* she pleads, *”and together we’ll prune the diseased branches…”* Her sentence hangs, uncompleted, but her implication is clear: salvation through sacrifice. 

The man extends a gnarl-cricked hand, roots spiraling toward me like needy serpents. *“With me,”* he rumbles, *”you become the bridge. Let the fire and rot cleanse what starlight cannot.”* His proposition drips with duality—a promise of renewal through chaos. 

The ground quakes as their auras clash. The sky darkens. Somewhere beyond the electric tension, I catch a flicker of something else: a small, frail sapling struggles upward between the roots at my feet, defying the darkness. Its leaves shimmer with captured starlight. 

I feel it then—the gravity of choice. Not just for myself, but for the unspoken millions in their realms. The pulse of the flowers quickens. Time here feels liquid, stretching and clinging. Every second a universe… and the sapling grows.
