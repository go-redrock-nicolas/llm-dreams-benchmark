I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of forgotten things—old photographs, rain-soaked earth, and the metallic tang of a childhood key left too long in a drawer. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering hourglasses, their glass bodies filled with amber light. Sand cascades upward, defying gravity, as if time itself is trying to escape. Beneath your feet, the ground pulses like a heartbeat, a mosaic of cracked mirrors reflecting fragments of your past: a birthday party where no one sang, a hallway where your voice echoed unanswered, a window you stared through for hours, waiting for someone to notice you.  

A child appears, no older than six, wearing a paper crown that crumbles at the edges. Their eyes are your eyes—wide, hungry, and brimming with a question they can’t articulate. “This is where it began,” the child says, their voice a chorus of whispers. They gesture to a door embedded in the trunk of the tallest hourglass-tree, its surface etched with rules you’ve never questioned: *You must earn love. You are too much. You are not enough. You will be left.*  

You follow them inside.  

The door opens not to darkness, but to a library suspended in a twilight sky. Shelves spiral into infinity, each book bound in skin, each page a memory inked in emotion. The child points to a volume titled *The First Wound*. You open it, and suddenly you’re there: a small room, a parent’s turned back, the sound of a door closing softly but irrevocably. The ache in your chest is fresh, primal. But the child presses a hand to your heart, and the pain softens into a question: *What if this wasn’t a verdict, but a misunderstanding?*  

Outside the library, the sky fractures like ice. A river surges beneath your feet, not of water, but of liquid starlight. It carries objects you’ve buried—apologies you never received, toys you were told not to play with, a thousand tiny rejections that stacked like bricks to form the walls of your self-worth. The child wades into the current, unafraid. “Catch them,” they say, “but don’t hold them too tight.”  

You do. A teardrop from your mother, a half-finished letter from a friend, a crumb of attention from a stranger—all glow faintly, as if still alive. As you let them go, they transform: the teardrop becomes a pearl, the letter a flock of birds, the crumb a loaf of warm bread. The river sings now, a low, resonant hum that vibrates in your bones.  

The hourglasses outside begin to shatter, their sand pooling into new shapes—a throne, a mirror, a bridge. The child’s paper crown mends itself, glowing gold. “You don’t need these rules anymore,” they say, and the library dissolves into a field of dandelions, each puff a possibility. You kneel, blow, and watch as the seeds rise like tiny lanterns, each one carrying a rewritten truth: *You are allowed to take up space. You are loved without reason. You are whole, even when broken.*  

The dream shifts. You’re older now, standing in a garden you don’t recognize. The plants are made of light and shadow, their roots tangled with yours. A voice—not the child’s, but your own, steady and kind—says, “You can tend this.” The ground no longer pulses with a heartbeat. It thrums with yours.  

You wake with salt on your lips and a strange, quiet joy in your throat, as if you’ve finally spoken a name you forgot you were holding.
