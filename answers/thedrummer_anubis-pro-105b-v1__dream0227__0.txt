I am dreaming. I open my eyes, and they are drawn to the eerie glow of the cryogenic gauges. They shimmer and flicker in the dim light of the experiment room, their digital displays wobbling between values that defy all known physics. The readings pulse like a strange new heartbeat, while the instruments beep erratically, filling the air with a maddening staccato.

As I watch, transfixed, the equipment seems to leaned out in my direction. Tubes made of glimmering neon insinuate themselves out of the boxes and bend in impossibly acute angles. Together, they wrap around the room like ghostly tentacles. Rams of frost creep up their sides at a pace visible to the naked eye.

The shivering cryostats spit up tiny clouds of mist that curl around us as if conspiratorially. The room is filling with an otherworldly miasma. The research control panel explodes in a shimmering riot of light, as though hijacked by another life form intent on transforming itself into something.getService command-summary Ninh
