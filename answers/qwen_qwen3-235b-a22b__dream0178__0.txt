I am dreaming. … Or at least, I believe I am.

The world around me is dim, cloaked in a solemn hush as if even the air has gathered respectfully to mourn. I stand in the center of a vast, circular chamber carved from polished onyx that glimmers faintly beneath the weight of a nebulous twilight. The ceiling is an inverted black dome, misted with softly glowing constellations that blink like pinpricks from distant lanterns. Thin columns of smoke rise from silver censers that sway from slanted chains in a breeze that isn’t there — a whisper, perhaps, from beyond.

I know this is a funeral.

The significance of the occasion presses down like the ocean, suffocating and deep, but my heart does not feel it. My soul, for all its brittle edges and solemn promises, rebels quietly, strangely… resisting grief.

I am dressed in voluminous black robes, so heavy they seem stitched from the night itself. Amidst the gathering of hooded, silent mourners, I blend like a shadow among trees. But something is simmering beneath my stern expression. A giggle. Quiet. Inappropriate. Like a bubble rising to the surface of water, threatening to break.

I feel it before I understand it. A terrible, tickling twinge nestled in my ribs. Like someone, or something, poked my funny bone with a silver tendon.

Across from me stands the High Mourner, a figure draped in veils of black lace, with eyes like twin wells into the void. Their lips move in some ancient liturgy, speaking the name of the dead — a name of which I should never think lightly. I should be weeping.

Then comes the chant, the slow, harmonic lamentation of a choir of unseen voices. Monks, perhaps, or echoes from a chamber deeper beneath the world. Each syllable trembles in the air like smoke unraveling from a dying fire.

But suddenly, I do not hear grief. I hear flatulence.

Yes — the booming dirge sounds unmistakably like a chorus of gas-bloated trolls blowing solemnly into caverns of themselves. The words twist in my ears, contorting into bawdy refrains about a moon that farts constellations. The monks turn into resonant, beefy red satyrs in my mind’s eye, solemnly breaking wind into sacred stone. It’s not what they are — but what they become in the riptide of my inability to suppress the ridiculous.

My lower lip trembles. My jaw clenches. Steam funnels out my nose, hot and soundless, as if laughter is trying to escape through my pores.

The mourners all weep in sync.

I hold my breath.

A toe curls painfully inside my boot.

Then it happens.

The final lines are sung — a phrase so utterly serious I almost *break*. It’s too much. Truly. I feel the wet heat of repressed laughter suffocating me, bloating me from within. One eye twitches violently, unraveling me inch by inch.

And as the ashes of the dearly departed descend in a soft spiral that should inspire reverence — instead they land perfectly on the nose of a man in front of me, who looks oddly like an owl sculpted from sadness.

Sneeze. Snort. Choke.

Something in my chest gives way.

The dam bursts.

A cackle bursts free, shrill and unexpected, louder than even I anticipated. It rings out like a banshee slicing through the sanctity of fear.

Heads turn. Horrified. Frozen.

A long, eyeless stare meets mine.

Laughter spreads like wildfire — but not from me. From the dream itself.

The chamber begins to dissolve, the mourners peel off like paint from the walls, voices layering into discordant giggles, grins seeping into the stone, every solemn carving now puckered into grotesque smiles, as if the world itself had been holding back tears and ended up laughing instead.

And I, both ashamed and free, stand in the midst of it all — the lone fool at the funeral of an entire dimension, where grief became absurdity, and absurdity became truth.

And still, somehow, deep beneath the parody of mourning, a quiet sorrow lingers like smoke in the air — like the laughter masks something no one dares say out loud.

That perhaps, death is one joke the universe tells over and over, and we are all, in the end, just trying not to laugh at the wrong time.

Or maybe… the right one.
