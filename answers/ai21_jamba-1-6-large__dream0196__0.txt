I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself transported to an unfamiliar, buzzing metropolis, with a night so dense it feels alive. A kaleidoscope of neon lights weaves through towering skyscrapers, as the crowd seethes like an ocean beneath. The air is electric, with a faint but constant hum, as if the universe itself is one immense machine vibrating to a cosmic rhythm. Suspended overhead are floating billboards—vast, glowing screens projecting holographic dancers, each move synchronized yet somehow fragmented like mirrors broken a thousand times.

A booming voice pierces through the chaos, announcing my name over a loudspeaker. Crowds turn, their eyes glowing neon from the lights. I stand in a narrow alleyway behind a stage, where I encounter a glowing, translucent figure—a guide of sorts. It looks human but radiates an ethereal light, shifting colors like a heat map. Its voice whispers in layers, each syllable overlapping, creating a haunting yet soothing melody. "You must perform," it says. "The crowd awaits."

I follow the guide, walking through a curtain onto the stage—vast and shimmering with an unsettling living quality. The stage is carpeted with undulating fibers, soft, tactile, pulsating like the pelt of some colossal organism. A seething audience stretches beyond the horizon, their faces distorted, oscillating between adoration and fury. Above me, beams of light shoot from a glowing sphere hanging in midair.

Confusion grips me as I'm handed an apparatus—a sleek, glowing instrument humming with energy, its glowing tendrils reaching out like vines, curling around my fingers. I feel its weight in my hands, mysterious and unyielding, as if it holds the essence of the universe. I try to speak, to question, but no sound escapes. Instead, my mind becomes a conduit, and I feel vibrations rise through my core, into my limbs.

The audience's anticipation crescendos into an almost unbearable pressure, as if the weight of their demand could crush me entirely. I clench my hands around the instrument, and it begins to hum, harmonizing with the low thrum in the air. My fingers move instinctively, as if remembering a skill I've never learned. The vibrations pulse through the ground, through the walls, and into the crowd. The murmurs grow louder, more unified.

At first, the instrument produces only chaotic bursts—sharp, discordant notes that scatter like sparks. But slowly, as my hands fall into unknown rhythms, the chaos orders itself, and a haunting melody rises. The audience's glowing eyes merge into a singular radiance, reflecting the space between worlds. I can feel every vibration syncing with the heartbeat of the cosmos. My body is no longer my own but a bridge between the mysterious force and the sea of onlookers.

And then, as suddenly as it began, it is over. I am left alone in the eerie glow of the now-silent stage. The audience slips away, their applause fading into a hum that vibrates on, vibrating beneath the fabric of consciousness. The city still throbs, but the urgency is gone. I am left with only the echo of a melody that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere, lingering hauntingly like a half-forgotten memory. I turn to look for my guide, but the translucent figure is gone, leaving me with a profound sense of completion—and a lingering question: Was any of this real?
