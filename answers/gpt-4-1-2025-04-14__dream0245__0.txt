I am dreaming.

The world flickers like candlelight behind a veil. I stand at the summit of an endless staircase, breathless from the climb, granite steps still echoing my heartbeat. I had scaled obsidian walls slick with mist, spoken riddles to sentient shadows, and unraveled labyrinths whose corridors receded like tides. My hands bear the memory of cold keys and phantom doors, illusions shattered by will and desperation.

Before me, a threshold gleams—a doorway forged from hammered silver, its surface swirling with shifting symbols. Triumph tingles at the edge of my consciousness. I reach, fingertips brushing metal. But as I cross the portal, reality unravels. Gravity tilts; the ground falls away. I am suspended between starless sky and a churning sea of mirror glass.

A voice, neither sound nor thought, curls through the air like incense: **"This is not the end, dreamer. This is invitation."**

Shapes rise in the fathomless depths below—a parade of all my deepest fears, clothed in the fleeting guises of those I love and the faceless heartbreaks I dared not name. They beckon, arms outstretched, merging and dissolving like ink in water. I want to run, but there is nowhere to run—only the infinite fall, and myself, fractured and whole, at its center.

I reach deep within, past the raw ache of doubt, to the wellspring of courage forged in earlier battles. The air thickens around me, crystallizing into a road of shimmering light—each step conjures memories of every barrier I have ever overcome, every wound survived, each kindness received or given.

As I place my feet on this impossible path, the shadows recoil, their whispers shifting from menace to muted gratitude. The sea of mirrors shatters, fragments rising like a flock of glass-winged birds and revealing a horizon rimmed with gold.

At the heart of the dream, I realize: the ultimate challenge is not to conquer, but to accept—to welcome the unfulfilled, the unfinished, the broken parts of my story, and to stride forward, unfurling hope with each step, into the dawn-lit landscape that waits just beyond the dream’s edge.
