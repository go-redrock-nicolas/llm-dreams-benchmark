I am dreaming. I'm dreaming that I'm present during a major public disaster that unfolds unexpectedly. Chaos is breaking out in the crowded streets, and panic is spreading among the civilians, but somehow, I find myself calm and collected. In fact, I feel at home here.

As I explore this dreamscape, I realize that it's not only me who's dreaming. Everyone around us is dreaming too, each with their own unique story and perspective. They are all part of the same collective consciousness, connected by invisible threads of emotion and memory. They are all part of the same dream.

And then I understand. This isn't just a dream. It's a shared reality, created by our minds together, where we can live and learn and grow, without fear or pain or death. It's a utopian world, shaped by our hopes and aspirations and imagination. It's a perfect world.

And I want to stay here forever.
