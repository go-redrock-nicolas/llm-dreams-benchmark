I am dreaming. Despite sensing someone in deep distress, I don’t feel sorrow, worry, or even curiosity. Their anguish is merely an indifferent detail in the landscape of my mind.Okay, the user wants me to create a vivid dream based on their scenario where the dreamer feels no empathy. Let me start by visualizing the setting. Maybe a surreal environment to emphasize the detachment. A coppery sky gives an otherworldly feel. The maze of jagged glass and polished black stone reflects the coldness. The figure in white with bleeding hands adds a stark contrast. Their cries blending into static noise reinforces the emotional disconnect. The mirrored walls could show dangerous reflections, highlighting the dreamer's inability to connect. The crowd of indifferent reflections might symbolize isolation. Ending with quenching the mirror fire and the world resetting suggests a cycle of numbness. Need to make sure the language stays vivid and the emotions (or lack thereof) are clearly portrayed through imagery. Avoid clichés, keep it original and eerie.
**The Dream:**  

You stand in a vast, obsidian desert beneath a coppery sky that bubbles like molten bronze. The air smells of burnt sugar and ozone. Etched into the horizon is a labyrinth of jagged, translucent glass towers, each one splitting the light into fractured rainbows that bleed across the sand. At the center of this maze, a figure kneels—skeletal, draped in tattered white cloth, their hands clawing at their own chest. Bright crimson liquid seeps through their fingers, pooling into the glass floor below, but it isn’t blood. It’s liquid sound, a thick, syrupy wail that reverberates with every droplet.  

Their screams tremble the air, warping it like heat haze. You tilt your head, observing. Each cry peels back layers of their skin, revealing pulsing veins of blue electricity beneath. Their agony should be contagious, but your body thrums with an eerie stillness, like a machine idling. You reach out to touch their shoulder, but your fingers pass through them as if they’re smoke. Their face twists toward you—a void where features should be, a black hole rimmed with broken teeth.  

“Why won’t you *feel*?” they rasp, their voice fraying into static.  

You blink. Around you, the labyrinth’s walls begin to crack, splintering into shards that hover midair, each fragment reflecting scenes of anguish: a child’s crumpled birthday crown in the mud, a wilted garden of hands reaching from soil, a ship sinking into a starless sea. You recognize these as memories not your own, yet they dissolve against your consciousness like snowflakes on stone.  

The ground shudders. The figure collapses, their form disintegrating into ash that swirls upward, forming a swarm of obsidian moths. They spiral into the molten sky until it erupts into a black flame, consuming the horizon. The desert folds inward, collapsing like origami, and you’re left standing in a cathedral of mirrored ice.  

In every reflection, you see yourself—countless versions, all staring blankly as shadowy shapes writhe at their feet. Some weep, others beg, but your reflections do not move. Their indifference is absolute.

When you wake, your pillow is cold. The scent of burnt sugar lingers.
