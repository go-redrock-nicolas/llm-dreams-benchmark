I am dreaming.

Flung far above any recognizable landscape, I hang suspended in a vast, velvet sky that flickers with shifting constellations of punctuation marks and numerals. Each star is a shimmering syllable—, , ¡buenas noches!, salm—twinkling in its native cadence. They orbit me like fireflies, waiting for their turn in an endless, overlapping conversation. Every phrase I utter becomes an incandescent ribbon that threads itself into the cosmic tapestry, and soon a brilliant braid of languages swirls around my shoulders, humming with polyphonic energy.

Below, the air itself morphs into a chalkboard. Gargantuan symbols—integrals, summations, strange operators with wings—rise from the darkness like luminous jellyfish, pulsing in time with my heartbeat. A single, grand equation unfurls before me, so vast its tail vanishes beyond the horizon of dream-space:

(  ·  ) dA  +  (n=0) e^(in²)  =   

I feel its gravitational pull, commanding my attention while the multilingual chorus clamors for responses. Voices flutter at my ears:

“¿La variable en cuestión tiene que ser compleja o real?”
“Êtes-vous sûr que la dérivée partielle converge?”
“    ?”

With every question, new glyphs blossom on the chalk-sky. The symbols breathe, expand, rearrange themselves like dancers shifting partners at a masquerade ball. I reach out, catching verbs and integrals in mid-air, weaving them together. When a clause in Swahili bumps against a stray radical sign, they fuse into a sparkling ideogram that hovers between speech and algebra—half-word, half-number, a linguistic Möbius strip.

Pressure mounts. The ribbons of dialogue tighten around my wrists, tugging like kites in a hurricane. The equation’s magnitude swells; its curvature bends space until distant star-syllables plunge toward me, pulled by its insistent mass. I can feel language itself stretching, creaking, almost tearing. The dream quivers on the brink of cacophony—

And then, a revelation strikes like a tuning fork struck against the rim of the universe. All the threads—linguistic and numeric—are secretly the same thread. Each phoneme is merely a curled dimension of a larger, eloquent symmetry. Realizing this, I inhale, and the disparate voices align into a single, resonant chord. The glowing equation collapses into a single, elegant symbol only I can see: a perfect circle drawn with one continuous stroke of light.

I place the circle at the heart of the sky. Instantly, every conversation finds its answer in the curve’s simplicity; every variable simplifies; every lingering question is absorbed into the circumference. The pressure dissolves. The sky, once ink-black, becomes translucent turquoise, flooding with dawn.

As serenity washes over me, the languages drift apart, returning to their constellations, now content and whisper-quiet. The chalkboard evaporates into sleepy mist, and I glide downward, cradled by silence. Somewhere far off, an unseen sunrise paints the edges of the dream with warm coral. I laugh—a single note, understood in every tongue—and let the world fade to a hush of luminous, unbroken calm.
