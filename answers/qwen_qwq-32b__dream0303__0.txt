I am dreaming. The air tastes like helium, light and effervescent, as I stand at the crossroads of a twilight meadow.  To my left, a river of liquid starlight courses through mirrored grass, its surface rippling with constellations I don’t recognize.  To my right, a cathedral of living coral rises from the earth, bleached ivory and neon pink, its stained-glass windows pulsing with bioluminescent algae.  Behind me, a door made of obsidian and spider silk creaks open on its own, revealing a corridor lined with portraits that blink their eyes in unison.  Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of inverted weather - rain falls upwards into a comet’s tail, and thunder rumbles in reverse.  I must choose, but my hesitation cracks the ground beneath my feet, sending vines of glowing moss snaking upward to coil around my ankles.  The river whispers in celestial harmonies, the cathedral exhales in phosphorescent sighs, and the door’s threshold hums a lullaby from a forgotten ditty.  Each option tugs like a gravity well, warping my synapses into static.  Somewhere, a clock tower chimes with the voice of a thousand overlapping echoes, its bells made of frozen laughter.
