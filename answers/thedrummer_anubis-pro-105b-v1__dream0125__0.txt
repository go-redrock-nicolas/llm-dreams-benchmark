I am dreaming. As the decisive moment approaches, my heart quickens with anticipation and a hint of fear. I stand facing a sleek, silver grand piano in the center of a grandiose concert hall that is filled with hundreds of expectant faces. In less than an hour, I am expected on stage to perform my most complicated piece - Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3.

For the last quarter of a century, though, I have always struggled with playing the piano. My left hand tends to trail my right, marring the harmony. Finger placement has never become second nature, and I have to concentrate with every keystroke.

But the stakes have never been higher. The grand prize is the world's oldest and most celebrated violin, a 250-year-old instrument worth millions of dollars.

I force my way back to the present as the theater doors open. My one hope now is that my opponent, a 14-year-old prodigy named Tommy, will mess up. But Tommy is the world's most successful pianist, having charged at least $100,000 per performance and perhaps becoming a milliamillionaire by 20. A gold sports car awaits Tommy if he wins.
