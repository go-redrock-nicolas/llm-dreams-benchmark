I am dreaming. …I decide to forge onward, refusing to let despair claw at my resolve. The world around me is a haunting canvas of silent devastation: skyscrapers lean like eerie skeletons into a bruised sunset sky, their windows shattered and throats choked with ivy. The wind moans through cars abandoned and rusting, carrying with it the distant peal of thunder and the faintest hint of lilacs—a ghostly reminder of what was.

With each cautious step, cracked asphalt crunches beneath my worn boots. I make my way down a boulevard that was once ablaze with neon and laughter, now only populated by the twittering of crows perched along the tangled power lines above. My backpack feels heavier by the day, its precious burdens reduced to a battered canteen, a half-eaten box of crackers, and a photograph of someone whose name slips ever further away with each night’s sleep.

As dusk deepens, vermilion and violet smear across the fractured glass of storefronts. Shadows scuttle in the corners—perhaps rats, or perhaps desperate scavengers like myself. But I remember a rumor whispered to me by a trembling survivor in a hidden cellar: there is a hidden garden beyond the northern blocks, where the earth still breathes clean and a spring burbles clear water from a secret fissure in the ground.

Driven by this hope, I climb over a toppled bus whose paint has been scoured away by the wind, its interior painted with intricate murals drawn by survivors and dreamers who passed before me. Their messages—“Keep going,” “Life grows here,” “Remember the sun”—flicker in my mind like candlelight.

Beyond, in a clearing choked with collapsed brick, I hear the unlikely tinkling of water. Heart thundering, I push aside a veil of flowering vines grown wild in the absence of human order. There, tucked within the hollow of a ruined courtyard, is the rumored oasis—a patchwork of emerald moss, the perfume of wild flowers, and a spring shimmering under the hesitant touch of starlight. For a moment, the world’s ruin is undone, and I kneel by the water’s edge, feeling the cool promise of hope and rebirth trickle through my fingers.

In the deepest embrace of dreaming, I realize that even in the shadow of the world’s ending, beauty and hope can crack open the hardest stone and coax life back into the bones of what was lost.
