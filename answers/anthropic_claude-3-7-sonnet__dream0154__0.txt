I am dreaming. # The Tides of Unbound Time

I awaken standing on a shoreline where the waves crash backward—retreating from the sand before swelling from the horizon. The sky above cycles through dawn, midnight, and dusk in undulating patches, stars blooming and fading like thoughts themselves.

To cross the beach before me, I must imagine where I'll be before deciding to walk there. My first steps sink into sand that remembers my footprints from tomorrow.

A lighthouse in the distance both crumbles with age and rebuilds itself simultaneously. Its beam sweeps across the landscape—not to warn ships, but to stitch moments together. Where the light touches, time briefly stabilizes.

I try to pick up a shell, but my fingers pass through it until I remember collecting it later. Only when I accept having already possessed it does it materialize in my palm—a spiraling nautilus with chambers representing years I haven't yet lived.

A child builds a sandcastle nearby, each tower collapsing before she places the first grain. She laughs, understanding this world better than I do. "You have to remember it standing," she tells me, "then it will be."

Trees along the coastal forest grow downward from their fruits to seeds, then upward again in ceaseless cycles. I watch a butterfly emerge from a flower and transform into a caterpillar, crawling backward to become an egg.

Words spoken here arrive before thoughts form, so conversations become puzzles of intentions and responses tangled across moments. To communicate clearly, I must listen to answers before knowing my questions.

The horizon bends into a möbius strip where ocean meets sky in an impossible geometry. I realize this dreamworld isn't broken—it's just free from causality's rigid chains, showing me that time itself is merely another dimension we've been taught to walk through in only one direction.
