I am dreaming. The air is thick with the hum of anticipation—whispers rustling like silk in the dark, the scent of polished wood and old velvet seats, the prickle of spotlights heating my skin before they’ve even found me. A grand theater, gilded in gold leaf and time-worn opulence, stretches endlessly upward, balconies cascading like tiers of a wedding cake into the inky heights above. Distant chandeliers shimmer like captive constellations, casting fractured light over a sea of shifting silhouettes—faces I can’t make out, yet I *know* they're waiting.  

My heartbeat thrums in my throat. This is it. The moment. The performance that will unravel or remake me.  

Then, the sickening drop of realization: I have prepared the wrong role.  

Panic grips my ribs like vines. My fingers twitch—where is my script? My instrument? My costume? The echo of my own breath fills my ears, too loud, too close. The audience's murmur swells, a tide of expectation. The spotlight narrows, a ruthless moonbeam pinning me to the stage, and I watch in horror as my hands—*are they even mine?*—begin to move of their own accord.  

But I don’t know the steps.  

The music starts, a melody I’ve never heard yet somehow remember. The notes are liquid, sliding between my fingers, impossible to grasp. I open my mouth to sing, but the words dissolve on my tongue, replaced by something ancient, unfamiliar. The language of dreams, perhaps. The floor beneath me shifts—no longer wood, but something soft, yielding, like the ribs of a great beast breathing beneath my feet.  

A laugh rings out from the dark. Then another. The audience isn’t clapping. They’re *chittering*. When I squint into the black, their faces flicker—too many teeth, too-wide smiles, eyes glinting like wet stones.  

And yet, I dance.  

My body betrays me, spinning, leaping, bending to a choreography I never learned. The curtain behind me billows, not with wind, but with something alive, something hungry, and I realize—  

This isn’t my performance.  

I’m *theirs*.  

The dream twists. I grasp for the edges of consciousness, but the music pulls me under, and the last thing I see before the dark rushes in is the spotlight guttering like a dying star—and the audience, rising from their seats, reaching.  

Then—  

Silence.  

(And the faint, distant sound of applause.)
