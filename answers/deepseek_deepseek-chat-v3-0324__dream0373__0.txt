You stand at the threshold of an ancient, overgrown glade, bathed in the shimmering silver light of twin moons hanging low in a violet-hued sky. The air thrums with a low, resonant hum, as though the very earth is alive with whispered secrets. Before you, two paths unfurl—each radiant yet perilous in its own way.  

To your left stretches **The Path of Wings**—a spiraling staircase of floating stones that ascend into the clouds.
