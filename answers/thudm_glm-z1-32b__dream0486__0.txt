I am dreaming. I am standing on a cliff overlooking aI am dreaming.  

I am standing on a cliff overlooking a **vast, primordial forest**, its canopy stretching endlessly into shades of indigo and emerald that defy the laws of time. The air is saturated with the weight of humidity, yet it thrums with an electric stillness—a silence so profound it hums. Below me, the forest floor pulses with bioluminescent ferns that undulate like liquid fire, their roots weaving through cracks in ancient stone that ripple like frozen lava. The ground itself seems to breathe, each breath releasing a fragrance of petrichor and decaying magnolias, sharp and cloying in equal measure.  

A sudden wind—neither cool nor warm, but charged with static like the moment before a lightning strike—sweeps me off my feet. I do not resist. My body becomes weightless, suspended in a current that carries me over treetops where bioluminescent flowers bloom in clusters, their petals sputtering stardust whenever a bough sways. Beneath these blooms, creatures I cannot name dart through the undergrowth: foxes with pelts of liquid mercury, moths the size of dinner plates with wings etched in constellations, and a stag whose antlers split into fractal branches that catch moonlight and refract it into prismatic arcs. They do not flee; they *greet* me, their eyes glowing with a recognition that burnslonging yet also feels like coming home.  

As I drift deeper, the forest surrenders to a hidden realm: an underground cathedral carved from quartz and druzy crystal. Columns of amethyst and citrine arch over a river that flows upward, defying gravity, its waters translucent yet impossibly alive with suspended particles of gold. I kneel at the river’s edge, and when I plunge my hand into it, the water does not wet my skin but instead dissolves into millions of tiny, singing motes of light that reassemble into memories—not my own, but *ours*: ancestral hands planting the first seed; a child laughing as they splash in a rain puddle from a thousand years ago; a future me, perhaps, cradling a sapling in a sunlit field I’ve never seen but suddenly *know*. The river, I realize, is not water but a lineage of desire, a mnemonicon stitching all lives into one continuous thread.  

A voice—neither male nor female, but resonant as wind through a bamboo flute—whispers, *“You are the root and the fruit.”* I look down, and where my feet touch the ground, a colossal lotus emerges, its petals not made of paper or silk but of **starlight and geological strata**, each layer revealing Earth’s chronicles from molten core to germinating leaf. As the lotus blooms, I am no longer outside it—I *am* it. My pulse syncs with the tectonic of continents, my breath with the carbon exchange between soil and atmosphere. For a timeless instant, I taste the salt of the first ocean, feel the fevered contraction of a volcano’s birth, and understand, without language, that every atom in my body has been every ocean, every desert, every breath of every creature.  

Then, the dream fractures. Not into darkness, but into a crescendo of color: a supernova of orange and violet blooms collapsing into a single, golden point. When I awaken, the pillow beneath me is damp, and the walls of my room feel impossibly close, yet my hands glow faintly, as though they’ve absorbed the forest’s alchemy. For days afterward, I find myself stopping mid-stride—on a subway platform, in a kitchen, at a crossing—staring at the ground, half-expecting to see roots snake through cracks in the pavement, or a moth with a galaxy on its wing land on my shoulder.  

The dream lingers not as a memory but as a wound, delicate and enduring, a scar tissue where the skin is the sky and the sky is the forest and the forest is me.
