I am dreaming. You’re floating on a silver mirror of mist, every breath rippling its glassy surface. As you drift, you sense a curious electricity in your bones—each subtle tilt of your head, each gentle arch of your back, sends shivers through the fog. You become aware that you’re not alone: reflections of dream-folk emerge around you, shaped like moth-light and shadow. They mimic your posture exactly, copying the looseness of your shoulders, the soft curl of your fingers, their pale faces lighting up as you smile—or darkening as you frown.  

With this increased body awareness, you realize that your unguarded gestures are speaking volumes. A casual shrug silences the dream-folk; a hesitant step backward makes them shrink into the mist. A slow, sweeping outstretch of your arms unfurls a wave of color—deep crimson roses burst forth on the mirrored lake, their petals unfolding in perfect sync with the curve of your wrist.  

Curious, you flex your spine into a gentle sway. The dream-folk follow, their forms melting into ribbons of starlight that spiral upward, weaving an opal canopy above you. Breath by breath, you practice the art of invitation: a low, open palm beckons them closer, and they answer with a chorus of quiet hums that tingle your skin like dew. You raise a single fingertip to your lips—suddenly every sound falls silent, and the fog parts.  

Empowered by this newfound control, you explore deliberate postures: a grounded stance summons warm sand beneath your feet, a lifted chest invites glowing lanterns to hover in perfect geometry, and a tilted head births playful fireflies that dance in your hair. In this dream-world, every nuance of your body weaves reality itself—each movement a secret spell. And as dawn’s first light shimmers on the horizon of your mind, you wake knowing that even in waking life, your silent language can shape the world around you.
