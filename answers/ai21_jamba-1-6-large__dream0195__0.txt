I am dreaming. Oh, but dreams are not for the unspoken; they're for the forgotten, the ignored, the unseen. And the voice that tells me I am dreaming is not mine. It belongs to another, a shadow that speaks in my sleep, a quiet presence with a voice like melted wax and cold glass. It sounds like me, and still, it doesn’t.

I am in a room made of glass. Not the breakable sort, but glass clear and strong as diamond.  Around the edges of the glass, the shadows flicker like things breathing. They make no sound, but I know they are watching. Someone is watching. I am carrying a candle, its flame orange and violent, licking against the glass. The flame does not melt the wax; the wax spreads, crawling over the floor in black tendrils, as if alive.

"It is not safe," the voice tells me. The voice that is mine but not mine, the shadow that is not here but everywhere. It clings to my thoughts like fog, like cigarette smoke. I tense, holding the candle up as if it could protect me.

"Do not run," says the voice. The glass around me vibrates, or perhaps I feel the world vibrating. "There's no point in running."

The floor beneath my feet feels suddenly soft, a thick, sickly energy sinking into the soles of my bare feet. It's alive. The dream cracks. I feel myself sinking, my feet melding with the floor, my body folding into the wax and glass. It isn’t painful. It feels like sleep, but like waking, like slipping into a dark lake and realizing it has been waiting for me.

As I sink, my vision distorts. Something vast and winged moves in the shadows beyond the glass walls. The room shakes, but I am sinking, down into myself, down into things I was never meant to understand.

"I am dreaming," I say again, but the words are liquid in my mouth, swallowed by the floor, by the room, by the hands of the shadows as they reach.

"You are dreaming," the voice agrees. "But dreams are not safe."

I want to ask more, to beg it to stop, to demand an answer to this place, but as I open my mouth, I wake.

I wake, and I am no longer me.

This is a problem, I realize, because I am also not dreaming anymore.

The dream is gone, but its tendrils are here, stretching into my waking moments. It's still in me, pushing against the fragile layer of my skin, a tether to that other place where shadows speak and glass holds the light. It wants me. The dream wants me back, whispering that I am not whole here, not like I’m supposed to be.

But here, now awake, in this room, I am me. I can see the walls, the ceiling, the light seeping through the blinds. I can feel myself whole. So why does it feel like I've been hollowed out, like the parts that make me who I am are somewhere else?

"It's all still there," the voice whispers.

"Where?" I ask.

"Beneath the surface," it whispers. "Deeper than skin."

I shiver, and in the shadows, I swear I see the glint of something watching me. But it's gone as soon as it comes, like air against my skin, leaving cold where the warmth once was.

The shadow is silent now. And, even though it’s quiet, I know it's not gone. Dreams are not safe, it had said.

I wait, counting my breaths, wondering if I’ll ever feel safe again.
