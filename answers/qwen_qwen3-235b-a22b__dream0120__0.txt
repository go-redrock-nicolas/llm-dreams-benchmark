I am dreaming. ...  I am asleep, yet I am here — woven into the fabric of an ancient world, where the air smells of myrrh and burnt resin and the sky presses on the earth like the weight of a thousand unspoken truths. I am a diplomat, a representative of distant lands and unknowable stars, embedded within the crystalline palace of Halyros, the City of Veils.

It is a realm where everything speaks in code. Each gesture, each glance is a syllable in a silent language of power. I’ve studied the etiquette of rank as one might decipher a sacred text in a tongue long dead — but still, I am foreign. And here, being foreign is not exotic; it is dangerous.

Tonight, the Great Banquet unfolds in the Carved Hall, hewn from a single block of iridescent black stone, pulsing softly like the belly of a living beast. The nobility is draped in robes of serpent-thread, shimmering with each movement, shifting colors like the surface of a poisoned lake. I have been seated near the circle of the inner court, a rare recognition. Or perhaps it’s merely proximity to the knife.

We dine on translucent fish that emit faint cries when pierced and sweets that melt into visions — scenes of autumnal wars and lovers made of ash and flame. I am full, lost in the dream-wine's blur, when I reach for a second plum-flake. A scribe beside me inhales sharply. A musical instrument stumbles mid-note. The chamber quiets.

I have insulted the King.

I learn too late: to take a second token of fruit is to suggest greed. Not hunger, but greed — and in the court of Halyros, that is not a mistake. It is a rebellion.

A procession forms. The Floor-Walkers are summoned — legless beings who slide on mirrors, their hands gesturing in a forgotten dialect that translates only one way: judgment. I am surrounded by silence. My title, once spoken with crescent-throated respect, now dissolves on tongues like black salt.

I am unmoored.

The sentence is not death — that would be too human.

Instead, they strip me of rank and memory. Not all at once, but in careful, silken layers. First my name, then the faces I have loved, then the scent of my homeland, then the shape of my mother’s laughter. Each memory is coiled like smoke and drawn from the back of my throat with a silver thorn.

Then, they appoint me Custodian of Silent Doors — charged with standing at thresholds where no sound must pass. I wear a robe woven from the dreams of the deaf and live in a tower carved from the bones of former dreamers. The stars above me are not the stars I remember.

And still, in the hush of midnight, in the quietest corridor closest to the edge of the world, I whisper something back into my skin.

A name. A scent. A cry.

I remember.

And somewhere in the dark palace, a floor creaks not at all like an echo.

I am dreaming.

And in this dream, I am beginning again.
