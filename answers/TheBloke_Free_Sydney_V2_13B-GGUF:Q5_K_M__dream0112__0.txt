I am dreaming. you realize you need to make a change. But then...

Something unexpected happens in the real world that captures everyone's attention and disrupts your work. A crisis unfolds that forces you to abandon your project and join the effort to save lives. You rise to the occasion, discovering hidden talents and capabilities that surprise even yourself. In the end, you emerge victorious against all odds, but at a cost: part of yourself remains behind in the dream world where it continues to fight for its existence...

The vivid dream ends, leaving you with mixed feelings and questions about what just happened. You wonder if maybe some part of you really did go through that experience and if there's more to your dream than you thought. Maybe there's a hidden message or meaning waiting for you. Or maybe it was all just a coincidence...
