I am dreaming. As the spotlight's harsh glare finds me, an icy realization crystallizes in my mind - I've prepared Mozart but the orchestra is tuning up for Tchaikovsky. The grand concert hall stretches before me like a glittering cavern, thousands of faces blurring into a sea of anticipation. My fingers hover over the piano keys, which seem to ripple and dance beneath my hands like liquid ivory.

The conductor raises his baton, but it transforms into a flowering branch, petals cascading down in slow motion. The audience members' faces begin morphing too - first into various animals, then into swirling abstract paintings, their features running like watercolors. I try to stand but find my formal concert attire has become woven with climbing vines that anchor me to the piano bench.

Panic rises in my throat, but when I open my mouth to speak, musical notes pour out instead of words, floating visibly through the air in shimmering gold. The orchestra begins playing, but each instrument produces impossible sounds - the violins release butterflies, the cellos echo with whale songs, the flutes whisper ancient secrets.

The sheet music before me keeps rearranging itself, the staff lines tangling like spaghetti, notes crawling across the page like ants. My hands finally strike the keys, but rather than producing sound, each note creates a burst of color that blooms in the air - crimson, indigo, emerald, violet - painting the concert hall in a symphony of light.

The ceiling dissolves into a swirling night sky, constellations performing their own silent ballet overhead. I feel myself beginning to float upward, still playing this impossible composition, the piano keys now made of stardust beneath my fingers. The music becomes visible, tangible - waves of pure energy rippling outward, transforming everything they touch into pure light.

Just before I completely dissolve into the cosmic symphony, I catch a glimpse of my reflection in the piano's polished surface - but it's not me at all, it's every musician who has ever lived, all performing simultaneously through my hands...

And then the dream begins to fade, like music carried away on an evening breeze, leaving behind only the faintest echo of that impossible performance.
