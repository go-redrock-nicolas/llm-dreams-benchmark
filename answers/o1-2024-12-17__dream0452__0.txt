I am dreaming. You find yourself in a place that seems carved from moonlight and stardust—a cavernous clearing at the edge of an ancient forest where the trees look like gently breathing giants. Their trunks shimmer with turquoise bark, and their silvery leaves twist in a mystic wind that seems to whisper your name. Overhead, a velvety sky churns with rose and gold clouds that ripple like cloth. You feel weightless, as if a single breath could carry you up among those luminous, shifting shapes.

At the very center of the clearing, there is a crystalline pool. The water hums with an otherworldly vibrato that echoes in your bones, and rainbow ribbons of light swirl across its surface. You notice shapes forming in the water: windows into memories you’ve shared with someone. You see two figures—yourself and them—once so vibrantly connected, laughing as kaleidoscopic flower petals fell from an invisible source above. The memory is warm and it tugs at your heart, yet you sense how time has reframed the closeness you once treasured.

The images in the pool dissolve like watercolor paint on parchment. In their place, you see a reflection of the here and now: the bond that used to feel like an unbreakable lifeline radiates a weariness, as though a gray fog has settled over its surface. You realize how you’ve given and given, how the energy you shared together has transformed into a shape that saps your spirit more than it nurtures you. The forest around you seems to hold its breath, leaves and branches pausing as if to listen to the surety stirring in your soul.

Honoring this evolving relational reality, you step closer to the water until it laps gently at your toes. The chill permeates your skin—startling yet invigorating. It’s a signal that you’ve truly arrived in this moment of choice. A gentle hush sweeps through the clearing, a hush that feels like kindness, like permission, and you understand you are ready to let go. In silence, you lift your gaze from the rippling water and look toward the trees, their phosphorescent leaves now glowing with an even brighter incandescence, as though giving their blessing.

You tuck your memories tenderly into your heart—a place reserved for gratitude, for the lessons and joys that have shaped you. The wind rustles again, stirring the leaves into a silver chorus, and you sense the forest encouraging you forward. You breathe in, and that breath seems to fill you with shimmering courage. 

Slowly, you reach one hand out over the crystalline pool, letting the softened recollections of that relationship drift from your fingertips. They become tiny glowing orbs, each floating up and away, migrating into the pink-and-gold clouds above. As they rise, an unspoken weight lifts off your shoulders, and the air around you sparkles with the promise of renewal. You feel a gentle swirl of warmth at your back, an almost maternal pat on your shoulder from the forest itself, telling you that it’s all right to pause, to grieve, to reflect—and then to continue onward.

With a single step, you move away from the water’s edge, and it feels as though you’re stepping onto a brand-new path. The clearing brightens, the sky deepens, and that moonlight-dusted horizon stretches out before you, vast and welcoming. You can sense the next chapter waiting beyond the glowing tree line—unwritten, but filled with possibilities.

You smile, inhale quietly, and begin.
