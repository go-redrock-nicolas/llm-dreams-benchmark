I am dreaming. I learn of a catastrophic event happening in an hour. No one believes my warning. I must stay calm and watch the clock tick down. Wait! The dream needs more vivid details -- the catastrophe's nature, the setting, the characters, maybe some surreal elements. The emotions of desperation and helplessness are key here. Perhaps a vividly imagined disaster like a giant wave or collapsing sky, a bustling cityscape where people ignore the warnings. Maybe surreal aspects like time distortion or symbolic elements. Need to flesh out the atmosphere and sensory details. Let me try creating that.
