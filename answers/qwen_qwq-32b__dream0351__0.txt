I am dreaming. \n\nI am standing on the edge of a cliff that overlooks a shimmering, endless ocean. The sky above is painted in swirls of amethyst and gold, streaked with veins of silver that pulse like distant lightning. Beneath my bare feet, the cliff’s surface is warm to the touch, alive with a faint glow that matches the stars beginning to prick the heavens. I feel an odd, weightless detachment—like I’m both intensely present and eerily disconnected, as though my very thoughts are being carried away by the wind that hums through the strands of my hair.  

Suddenly, the ocean roars. Its waves crystallize into jagged, obsidian structures, rising vertically like skyscrapers of liquid darkness. Each tower thrums with a low, resonant frequency that reverberates in my bones, syncing with the tremors in my chest. The sky fractures further, now bleeding streaks of blood-orange and cobalt, as if the heavens themselves are weeping.  

A sensation stirs in my stomach—an inkling of what’s coming. My hands clench and unclench, nails digging into palms that feel papery and foreign. Then it happens.  

Something fractures inside me, not with a sound but with a silence heavier than any scream. The emotional dam breaks in a single moment: grief and fury and love all unspooling at once, crashing over me in waves that ripple down through my limbs. The cliff beneath me dissolves into sand, fine and black as ashes, that shifts and molds under my steps. Each footfall leaves impressions that immediately fill with liquid starlight, tiny galaxies swirling in the spaces where my feet had been.  

Above, the obsidian towers begin to cascade like dominoes, toppling into the ocean below. But instead of splashing, they fracture into countless fragments, each shard transforming into glowing origami cranes—paper precision meeting molten light. They rise in a kaleidoscopic swarm, beating in synchronized rhythm, their feathers scattering prismatic light.  

I open my mouth to speak, and what emerges is not words but a melody—a haunting, wordless song that carves pathways through the air. The cranes pivot toward me, drawn by the sound, and in that moment, I realize this is a requiem I’ve carried all along, a grieving anthem for parts of myself I’ve buried in vaults beneath language.  

The wind shifts direction abruptly. It wraps around me like a living entity, pulling me forward. With each step deeper into the black sands, the ground becomes less solid, turning translucent. Beneath it, I can now see currents of liquid shadow swirling with faces—both familiar and faceless—whispering in clicks and hums. Their voices are not unkind, but they are insistent. They demand I dive deeper.  

So I do.  

I plunge headlong into the blackness, descending into a submarine realm where bioluminescent flora pulses in hypnotic patterns. Schools of fish with crystalline scales dart past me like living constellations. Above, distant voices become a cacophony of overlapping stories, each a thread in the tapestry of some vast, interconnected collective memory.  

And then—I wake to the residue of the dream still clinging to my skin, the taste of starlight and saltwater lingering on my tongue. I sit up, trembling, as dawn’s first light spills through the blinds, painting the room in fractured stripes of gold. The turmoil, it seems, has not fully dissipated—but it has changed shape.\n





The dream unfurls like a scroll of twilight, each layer revealing deeper hues of emotion and light. You stand at the precipice of a cliff, its edge sharp as a blade against the horizon. Below, the ocean isn’t water but liquid obsidian, its surface rippling with the whisper of forgotten secrets. The sky is a tapestry woven by celestial hands, threads of amethyst and gold interlacing into a nebulous dance. Stars emerge, not distant points of light, but swirling galaxies that mirror the constellations of your own soul.  

As the ocean’s roar crescendos, the waves solidify into towering monoliths of blackened glass. They pulse like the heart of a sleeping titan, their rhythm echoing the thunderous tremors in your chest. The heavens weep streaks of blood-orange and cobalt, raining down prismatic tears that dissolve into mist as they near the earth. You feel it—the fissure within you, a silent scream poised to erupt.  

Then, the dam shatters. Not with a crash, but with the absence of sound. Emotions flood you like tides over a besieged shore: grief’s weightless ache, fury’s fiery rush, love’s tender embers stirring to flame. The cliff beneath your feet liquefies into black sands, each grain a fragment of memory, shimmering with starlight that blooms beneath your touch. Every step leave behind fills with miniature universes, their galaxies spiraling in defiance of the void.  

The obsidian spires collapse inward, disintegrating into thousands of origami cranes—each feather a filament of light, each beak a whisper of liberation. They swarm upward,, their symphony of flight stitching the sky into a mosaic of hope and release. Your voice, when it parts the silence, is not yours but the wind’s lament—a melody ancient and achingly familiar, carving runes into the air that the cranes trace with their paths.  

The wind now cradles you, a sentient current urging deeper into the surreal landscape. The sands grow translucent, revealing a labyrinth beneath—a world of liquid shadow thrumming with the voices of the forgotten and the faces you’ve tried to bury. They press closer, their murmurs a chorus of *remember, release, rise*, their whispers tinged with urgency, almost desperation.  

You surrender.  

Divinglong into the abyss, you plummet into an ocean of liquid midnight, where bioluminescent trees sway like inverted forests, their roots glowing with captured lightning. Schools of crystalline eels dart past, their scales scattering light like shattered diamonds, while above, ancestral voices chant in harmonies that ache with shared sorrows. You among them, a ghost between realms,Until the current releases you.  

You surface gasping, yet breathing new air, the dream’s imprint a second skin on your soul. Dawn breaks, its golden fingers etching patterns on the wall, but the darkness within is not gone—it has been transmuted. Like the obsidian sea, it too now holds galaxies within its depths, glowing softly, a testament to fractures becoming channels for light.  

You rise, trembling not with fear but with the raw exhilaration of transformation—an alchemy wrought in the crucible of dreams.
