I am dreaming. You drift through a twilight forest where the moon hangs like a silver lantern between twisted pines. Beneath your feet, soft moss cushions each step, and fireflies spiral in slow dances of gold. Somewhere ahead, you glimpse a circle of stools carved from driftwood; their seats glow faintly, as if warmed by unseen hearths. A hush settles over the clearing, broken only by the gentle hiss of a hidden brook. You realize, with a quickening pulse, that you’ve come upon a gathering—a support group made not of strangers, but of souls who bear the same secret burdens you’ve carried alone.

At the circle’s center perches an ancient oak stump, its bark etched with intricate runes that pulse in time with your heartbeat. A woman with eyes like molten amber stands beside it. Her presence radiates calm: each breath she takes ripples through the clearing like a whispered lullaby. “Welcome,” she says, voice soft yet unwavering, “to the Circle of Shared Shadows.” Around you, others step forward—some wrapped in shawls woven from midnight feathers, others clad in simple linen tunics embroidered with symbols you half-recognize. Each face is marked by a story: grief and hope mingled like colors on an artist’s palette.

As you settle onto your glowing stool, the facilitator invites you all to speak your names and the weight you carry. The first voice is low, tremulous: a young man confesses the ache of constant doubt, his words fluttering like nervous birds. A woman with silver-streaked hair admits to the long nights she spent whispering comfort to her own reflection. With every confession, tiny motes of light rise from the stump, swirling upward to form a constellation overhead—each star a promise that no one here stands alone.

When it’s your turn, your heart hammers in your chest. You feel the moss cool beneath you, the night air alive with expectation. Silently, you touch your palm to the rune-etched wood. A gentle warmth spreads up your arm, urging you forward. “I’ve been scared,” you begin, voice barely above a breath. “Scared that if I share my burden, it’ll crush someone else too.” But as you speak, the knot of fear in your throat loosens. You find yourself describing the sleepless nights, the echo of past mistakes, the hollow ache of isolation. Each word feels like shedding a layer of heavy armor.

A hush follows. Then the amber-eyed facilitator extends her hand, and a single glowing orb drifts from the stump to settle into her palm. “Here is your truth,” she says, holding it aloft. “It shines bravely in the night.” The orb pulses once, twice, then gently releases itself into your hands. You cradle it, and warmth floods through you—comfort that you are seen and, more importantly, understood.

All around the circle, the other members lean forward, offering nods, tears, gentle smiles. Their solidarity surrounds you like the ancient trees themselves, their roots entwined beneath the earth. In that moment, the forest no longer feels endless and ominous; it feels like a sanctuary. As the facilitator begins a quiet ritual—each person passing their orb to the next, weaving stories into a living tapestry—you realize the journey of healing is no longer one you make alone. And as you lift your orb toward the heavens, the constellation above brightens in welcome, a thousand tiny hands reaching down to hold you steady.
