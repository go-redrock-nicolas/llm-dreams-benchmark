I am dreaming.

In the hush between worlds, I find myself wandering a luminous forest, where the trees bend gently overhead and shimmer with silver-blue leaves that hum the notes of remembered lullabies. The air is rich with the scent of petrichor and wild jasmine. My thoughts feel loose and weightless, tumbling through the undergrowth like shy rabbits.

But a cold, invisible wind begins to ruffle the branches. From the sky, faceless clocks spin down, ticking and clicking insistently, chasing away the music of the leaves. The colors start to fade; the scent drains from the air. My mind contracts, the bright ideas evaporating, the world flattening into dull, gray lines.

And yet—I will the clocks to slow. I imagine a clearing, deep and hidden, where no clocks can follow, no shadow of urgency can reach. In this secret glade, the grass glows emerald and the air is alive with golden motes. Here, I lie down on a bed of soft moss, letting the warmth soak into my bones. I breathe deeply, and as I exhale, I feel the tangled knots of anxiety unravel into silk threads beneath my skin.

All around, the trees begin to paint themselves with every color I have ever loved—magenta, ochre, peacock blue, and fierce crimson. Birds with wings of glass and fire swoop and flit, singing tunes that make the ground tremble with possibility. Insects, sculpted from sapphires, drift lazily on the air, sketching fractal shapes in the sky.

No one demands anything here. Time is soft; results are irrelevant. I realize that it is in this womb of gentle expectation and curiosity where my imagination is born anew and expands without end. 

With each breath, wild ideas bloom and twine around my being: novel inventions, strange stories, impossible landscapes. I commune with them, weaving them into intricate tapestries that hang between the trees, illuminated by moon-green lanterns. Here, in this inner sanctuary, I cultivate the gentle conditions in which my creativity not only survives but flourishes, abundant as fireflies on a sultry night, unencumbered by the world’s insistence on product and outcome.

And so, I dream—unhurried, boundless, impossibly bright.
