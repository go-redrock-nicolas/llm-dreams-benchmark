I am dreaming. The air shimmers with an ethereal glow, casting prismatic hues across an endless field of towering crystal spires. The ground beneath my feet is spongy yet solid, reacting to my touch with soft, harmonic hums. I notice a path that pulses faintly, but my curiosity is drawn elsewhere—a shimmering pool reflecting not my face, but swirling galaxies. When I reach out to touch it, a voice whispers encouraging me to leap. The rational part of me argues for restraint, but the thrill of the unknown pulls harder. And then—I jump.
