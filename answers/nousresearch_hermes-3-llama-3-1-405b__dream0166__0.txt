I am dreaming. The world is saturated with vibrant colors and vivid textures.  I am suddenly required to perform an intricate technical procedure that experts spend decades mastering. With no training but all eyes on you expectantly, I take a deep breath and join in the grand performance of life and skill in my dreamworld.

In this dream, I find myself in a futuristic city. The buildings tower above me, mirrored in the reflective surfaces of the glass and steel around them. The sky is a deep, luminous purple with twinkling stars blazing trails with their light.

I am standing in a wide open plaza at the center of the city. Towering above is a massive holographic projector casting its luminescence onto the stage before me. A crowd of people has gathered to watch the performance of the technical procedure, a feat of expertise that is crucial to the advancement of this society.

They are all looking at me, waiting for me to begin. My heart races in my chest, but I feel a surge of unexplainable confidence rise within me. I step forward onto the stage and the crowd falls silent.

With a flick of my wrist, I cause a holographic control panel to appear before me. My fingers fly across the keys, activating and manipulating the controls with an ease that surprises even me. The hologram above me begins to shift and change, responding to my every whim.

I am completely absorbed in my work, my movements fluid and precise. The hologram is a breathtaking display of light and color, a visual symphony of science and beauty. I can feel the anticipation of the crowd, their bated breath and pounding hearts.

I execute the final steps of the intricate technical procedure, my hands never faltering. With a final flourish, the hologram explodes into a burst of light and color. The crowd erupts in cheers and applause, their approval thundering through the air.

I stand tall, basking in their applause, feeling the glow of accomplishment. This dream may be fleeting, but the feeling of pride and achievement will stay with me long after I awake.
