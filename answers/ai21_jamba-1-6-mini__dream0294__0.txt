I am dreaming. I am standing in a stark, industrial kitchen, the kind I’ve always felt out of place in, wearing an apron instead of my usual armor of professional attire. The air is thick with the smell of garlic and roasting spices, a smell that makes my mouth water despite myself. I’m surrounded by people I know but don’t quite know—friends, family, colleagues, a strange mix that feels like a party I wasn’t invited to but somehow crashed.

And then, she enters. My mother. Her presence fills the room, not with words but with a quiet, unshakable belief in me that I’ve never quite let myself believe. She moves like a dream—graceful, effortless, and unbothered by the kind of self-doubt that has always clung to me.

She approaches me, her eyes soft but unwavering, and hands me a wooden spoon. “Here,” she says, her voice steady but warm, “You’re doing it right. Keep going.”

I take the spoon numbly, my heart fluttering in my chest. The kitchen is alive with the swelling pride of everyone around me, their voices mingling in a chorus of affirmation.

“You’re cooking like your mother,” a familiar voice says softly, and I glance over to see my friend, a smirk playing on their lips but their eyes sincere.

“Your adobo would make even the toughest little old lady proud.”

I want to laugh, I want to cry, I want to run—because this kind of praise is a foreign language to me. In my waking life, I’ve never believed I could cook well, let alone be praised for it. But here, in this dream, the walls of my own self-judgment are crumbling.

I keep stirring, my movements more confident now, and I’m surprised to find that the adobo is actually… good. The perfect balance of soy sauce and vinegar, the tender chunks of chicken and the rich aroma filling the room. The kitchen buzzes with approval, the warmth of the stove reflecting in the warmth of the praise.

And as I cook, my mind begins to clear. The self-criticism that has been my lifelong companion is quiet for once, replaced by an unexpected sense of peace. I’m still in my own skin, but now it feels different, lighter. Someone grabs me from behind, twirling me around, and it’s my grandmother—an image of her I hadn’t thought of in years, her face full of life and love.

“You’ve got her touch,” she says, her accent making me smile, “Your food is good, just like you.”

The words hit me like a warm, unexpected hug. I pause for a moment, surprised to find myself laughing, tears in my eyes. The warmth of the dream, the voices, the people around me—it feels real, and it feels like a truth that has always been there, waiting for me to notice.

I wake up, the dream lingering, the words still echoing. The pride, the love, the sense of not-quite-belonging—it all feels more real in the dream than it ever has in my waking life. And for the first time, I dare to wonder if the compliments I’d always brushed off weren’t just misplaced all along. My pride, my sense of self, it feels just a little more solid, like something I can finally believe in.
