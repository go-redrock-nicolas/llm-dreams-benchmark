I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of petrichor and something older—something like the memory of forgotten stars. I stand in a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering columns of obsidian veined with liquid light, their roots plunging into a ground that shimmers like oil on water. Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of inverted colors: a violet sun bleeds into a turquoise void, while constellations swirl in reverse, their stars blinking *out* one by one as if being erased.  

There, half-buried in a pool of mercury that reflects nothing, lies the stone. It is not stone, truly—it pulses like the carapace of some primordial beast, its surface etched with symbols that writhe when I try to focus. The glyphs are alive, shifting between languages that predate Babel: spirals that hum with the resonance of collapsing galaxies, jagged lines that flicker like the edges of a blade forged from time itself. My breath catches. This is the riddle. The *true* riddle. The one scholars whispered about in smoke-filled chambers before vanishing without a trace.  

I kneel, fingertips brushing the carvings. The moment I touch them, the world fractures.  

Suddenly, I am *inside* the riddle. The symbols unravel into a labyrinth of corridors made of mirrors that do not reflect but *remember*. Each step echoes with the voices of those who sought the answer before me—kings, madmen, children who spoke in tongues. One mirror shows a woman with serpents for hair weeping black tears; another, a city suspended upside-down over an ocean of liquid amber. The riddle’s words coil in my mind like a serpent eating its own tail:  

*"I am the wound that heals by bleeding, the silence that speaks, the shadow that burns. What am I?"*  

The answer dances at the edge of my thoughts, but every time I reach for it, the labyrinth shifts. A door materializes—a portal framed in bones that glow faintly blue. Beyond it, a desert stretches under twin moons, their light knitting patterns into the sand that spell out half-truths. A river flows backward here, its waters a liquid mirror that shows not my face, but my *soul*: a flickering moth-winged thing, stained with constellations.  

A figure emerges from the desert—a being of smoke and stained glass, its voice a chorus of wind through dead leaves. "You are close," it says, though its mouth does not move. "But the answer is not a word. It is a *sacrifice*."  

The ground trembles. The riddle’s symbols ignite across my skin, searing but painless, and I realize the truth: the answer is *myself*. The wound that heals is the letting go—the surrender of the self to become part of the eternal question. The silence that speaks is the pause between heartbeats when the universe breathes. The shadow that burns is the part of me that must be left behind.  

The labyrinth collapses. I fall into a void where time pools like water, and there, at the bottom of everything, I see it: a key made of stardust and shadow, floating above an altar carved from the first stone ever split. To take it would mean awakening with knowledge that could unmake me. To leave it would mean forgetting this dream ever existed.  

I reach out.  

And then I wake, gasping, the taste of ozone on my tongue and the echo of the riddle’s final whisper in my bones: *"The answer is the question itself."*
