I am dreaming.

I stand in the shattered remains of what was once my home, the broken planks of timber groaning under the weight of the still-drifting ash. The air is thick with dust, hazy sunlight filtering through the swirling motes like a half-remembered dawn. The silence is not truly silent—somewhere, something crackles, and distant winds moan across empty foundations—yet the quiet feels profound enough to press against my chest.

I look at what used to be familiar walls, now reclining in layers of splintered beams and crumbled concrete. My footsteps are hesitant. Each step unsettles debris that once held my life together—my family’s old pictures in shattered frames, the soggy remnants of once-cozy furniture, the battered remains of a once-gleaming clock. Fractured windows glint with an otherworldly dullness, like the sight of heartbreak turned to glass.

But as I wander, I sense the inexplicable heartbeat of this dreamscape. A soft pulse of something—hope, perhaps—emanates from the rubble. It seems to breathe beneath my feet, shimmering in subtle colors that dance across the broken ground. My skin tingles with the lingering energy of this lost world, as though the memory of my home refuses to die. I kneel, brushing away ash to find bits of colored tile from the kitchen floor—here a sapphire piece, there a rose-pink shard. The tiles still hold the warmth of laughter and everyday our-lives, even in their current ruin.

Up ahead, where my living room once opened out onto the back garden, stands a single, crooked tree. Its branches reach desperately toward the sky, torn leaves fluttering in the breeze. The bark bears deep scratches and scorched patches, but life endures in the few leaves that remain, glimmering with dewdrops hidden from the devastation. It stands guard over the turmoil, nobly refusing to collapse. That lone, battered trunk aches with a reverence only nature can evoke, renegotiating its existence in a world turned upside down.

As I walk closer, time seems to blur. The sky changes color: first a dark, slate gray reminiscent of storm clouds, then a brilliant, swirling orange shot through with streaks of violet. The clouds themselves twist into shapes: for one instant they appear as roiling dragons, for the next, disembodied wings, each shape drifting away in the blink of an eye. A hush falls over everything. The tenuous hush feels sacred.

A smell like lavender and rain-drenched earth washes over me—unexpectedly fresh and comforting in this landscape of devastation. Following the scent, I unearth from beneath the rubble a small, porcelain music box shaped like a seashell. Gently, I pry it open, half-expecting the mechanism to be broken beyond repair. Yet as I lift the tiny lid, a sweet lullaby trembles into the motionless air. The gentle tune resonates in the hollowness of the burnt timbers, drifting upward, weaving a tapestry of memory and longing out of the discordant quiet.

The song guides me deeper into the wreckage, and with each step, the ground transforms before my eyes. The jagged ruins soften. Shards of broken glass meld into sparkling crystals, each reflecting tiny flickers of starlight. Walls begin to rebuild themselves in my peripheral vision, as though the dream’s reality wants to heal and reconstruct the spaces that once nurtured life. Hints of color—pastels and gold—flit across dusty corners, fragile illusions trying to remind me of the warmth that once thrived here.

In the distance, I suddenly spot silhouettes of people who once populated my life: neighbors, friends, my family, all standing in soft focus, their edges blending like watercolor. They do not speak, but I sense their presence, a collective spirit of love and tragedy standing vigil in this place. Each figure seems to shimmer, like they are caught between departure and return. Swirls of dust and light gather around them, forming ribbons of luminous air that connect us in unspoken recognition.

A swell of emotion grips my chest. Fear, grief, stubborn hope, and a curious yearning for a future where the seeds of this moment blossom anew. The lullaby from the music box crescendos, and the dream’s color palette intensifies: the skies a swirling purple-and-pink masterpiece, the ground buzzing with an otherworldly spectrum, as if the world itself is refracted through broken shards of rainbow.

Suddenly—like a breath exhaled by the universe—the music fades to a hush, and everything grows still. In that moment, I notice something miraculous. Tiny green sprouts peek through cracks in the rubble. Their emerald leaves, delicate as a newborn’s breath, tremble in the air saturated with gentle possibility. They are faint but persistent. They symbolize growth, and they call out to me with silent hope. It feels as if nature herself is offering a second chance, whispering that not all is lost.

I lower myself and cradle these budding seedlings in my palm, feeling their tender hearts beat with life. The memory-shadows of home and loved ones linger, watching over me in silent reverie. I close my eyes and inhale, filling every corner of my lungs with the mingled scent of ash, rain, lavender, and survival. Beneath my palms, in that moment, I sense a pulse that says: wake up, rebuild, and remember.

I am dreaming, yet I feel more alive than ever. Pomised with renewal even in hopelessness, I stand in this realm of devastation, with consciousness dancing between despair and the spark of new beginning. And as I open my eyes one final time, I see the edges of the dream’s horizon glow with a newborn sunrise, blazing in gold and rose, promising that even in the direst circumstances, a compelling and vibrant rebirth awaits.
