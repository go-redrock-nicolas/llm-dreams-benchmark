I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt lavender as you step onto a bridge woven from threads of starlight, suspended over an abyss that pulses like a living heartbeat. Below, shadows coil and unravel, forming fleeting shapes—a lion with wings of smoke, a clock devouring its own hands, a child’s hand clutching a moth that glows like a miniature sun. The bridge shudders with each step, its strands snapping and reknitting in a rhythm that matches your breath, as though the structure itself is alive, uncertain whether to guide you forward or let you fall.  

Ahead, three doorways float in the void, each defying logic. One is a gaping maw of moss-covered stone, teeth of ivy gnashing silently. Another is a sheet of liquid mercury, reflecting not your face, but a version of you with eyes like twin eclipses. The third is a wound in the air—a jagged tear oozing faint, ultraviolet light. You feel the pull of all three, their whispers threading into your skull: *“Choose, but know you’ll forget why.”*  

You reach for the mossy door first. It opens to a desert where the sand is made of shattered mirrors, each shard showing a different moment from a life you might have lived. Here, time is a spiral. You see yourself as a king dethroned by a sparrow’s song, as a hermit etching equations into the bones of a leviathan, as a ghost haunting a cathedral built from frozen tears. The visions don’t cohere—they *bleed*, one into the next, and when you try to grasp their meaning, the sand cuts your fingers, drawing ink-black blood that pools into new, writhing shapes.  

A figure emerges from the mercury door: your reflection, but older, wearing a coat stitched from moth wings and carrying a lantern filled with screaming fireflies. It offers you a key made of ice, hissing, *“The third door leads to answers. Or to the end. Or to a question you’ll regret.”* The key melts in your hand, its water hissing as it strikes the mirror-sand, carving a glyph that glows like a curse.  

Suddenly, the wound in the air begins to widen, vomiting forth a symphony of dissonant chords and the taste of copper. Through the tear, you glimpse a city of towers that bend like reeds in a storm, their windows flickering with faces you recognize but cannot name. A river of liquid time snakes through the streets, carrying fragments of forgotten conversations and half-formed creatures—part fish, part clock, part scream.  

You run toward the city, the ground shifting beneath your feet into a mosaic of your own memories, rearranging themselves with each step. Here, a childhood room dissolves into a battlefield; there, a lover’s face fractures into a kaleidoscope of possibilities. You realize you’re not just walking through a dream—you’re *negotiating* with it, bartering certainty for clarity, clarity for survival.  

At the river’s edge, you meet another version of yourself, hollow-eyed and grinning too wide. It hands you a vial of liquid shadow. *“Drink,”* it says, *“and you’ll see the pattern. But patterns are prisons too.”* Behind you, the three doorways collapse into a single eye, lidless and blinking in slow motion.  

You wake just before choosing.  

The dream clings to you like wet silk, its questions seeping into your bones. What was the city? Who built the bridge? Why do you now hear whispers in your own voice, arguing about paths you never took? The answers, you suspect, are not meant to be solved—but to be *lived*, again and again, in the infinite, flickering labyrinth between sleep and waking.
