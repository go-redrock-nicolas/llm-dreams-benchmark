I am dreaming. …I take a firm grip of the slick, salt-crusted wheel, my knuckles glowing moon-pale against the deep varnish. Lightning splits the horizon in mad, crooked veins, illuminating a wild sprawl of heaving water—waves like onyx mountains, their peaks snatching at the bruised underbelly of the heavens.

The deck rolls beneath my boots, trembling with the thunder’s roar, the wood moaning its ancient song. My crew—faces ghostly in the stormlight—cling to lines and rigging, eyes wide with trust and terror. They are shadows striped with sweat and rain, their breaths lost in the screaming wind.

Above us, sails billow and snap like wounded wings; the mast groans under the weight of wind that smells of brine and distant ice. I fear the sea will swallow us, drag us into the labyrinth of its cold, dark memory. Yet I stand, spine iron-straight, heart pounding—a drum that keeps time with the ocean’s fury.

I shout orders, my voice defiant, ragged, yet sure. "Hoist the mainsail! Secure the starboard lines! Trust in the hull—she’s weathered storms before!" My words crack through the night, and my crew responds, moving with desperate resolve, their faith a fragile beacon in the tempest.

And then, in the heart of chaos, I see something impossible: the storm parts just enough to reveal a distant, shimmering island. Its shores glimmer with an otherworldly luminescence—pale blues and greens, like the glow of hidden pearls or secret fires. Palms bend low in welcome, and rivers of silver thread from the mountains we can only glimpse.

A quiet certainty fills me: beyond this storm, beyond fear, something waits—a treasure, a truth, or a home lost to waking memory. For now, I am a captain, master of a ship between worlds, steering us all toward dawn, through wild beauty and terror, into the endless, electric heart of the unknown.
