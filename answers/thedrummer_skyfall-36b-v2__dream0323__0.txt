I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the helm of a naval vessel, the weight of command heavy on your shoulders. Dark clouds churn in the sky above, reflecting the turmoil that brews within. The steel deck beneath your feet vibrates with the frantic, offbeat rhythms of a ship in disarray. 

Your crew, a motley assembly of desperate souls, gather around you, their eyes wide with desperation and fear that you will be able to deliver. Though their words are silent, the chiming corners of their minds cry out for your guidance. Amidst the cacophony of doubt and dissent, you must chart a course through uncharted, perilous waters. 

The ship lurches, throwing its passengers off balance, sending them careening across the deck like rag dolls. The storm rages, threatening to devour the vessel, its crew and their captain, wholly. Waves crest and crash against the ship's bow, water surging through the cracks, filling the hull at an alarming rate.

In your dream, you are the lone faint light in a world engulfed in darkness. The crew, camaraderie fractured, look to you as the sole glimmer of hope in the bleak abyss. Your brain races; the situation is dire. 

You know that to succeed, you must forfeit the ways of those that came before you. 

Traditional protocols have proven ineffectual, and the pressure builds, waiting for you to falter. In this fantastical world conceived in dream, you are the final frontier; the last line of defense against defeat.

The crew forces their way into the captain's office, storming it as if they are the true leaders. They flood the space, their thoughts clouds of steam pouring from an overheated kettle. You see now the faulted stars in their eyes, chemicals rushing through their veins.

The enormity of your leadership title weighs you under. 

The crew circles around you, eyes dimmed and hearts heavy. 

This is your moment, Captain.
