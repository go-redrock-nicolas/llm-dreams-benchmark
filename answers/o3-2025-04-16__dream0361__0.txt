I am dreaming. …keep walking, and suddenly the dream unfurls around you like a living mural, richer and more luminous with every step.

You find yourself on the roof of a colossal library that drifts through a night-sky ocean. The roof is made of parchment shingles; constellations ink themselves on the pages beneath your feet as you move. Far below, critics in tidy waistcoats peer through brass telescopes, shaking their heads and jotting disapproving notes into ledgers titled “Realistic Endeavors.” Every time one of them writes a reprimand, scarlet ribbons of ink coil upward and try to snag your ankles—yet they dissolve the instant you think, No, I’m going anyway.

Ahead, a lone staircase appears, spiraling upward even though nothing visible supports it. Each step is a different, glowing color, humming like tuning forks tuned to secret keys. You know the staircase is rumored to end nowhere, that it is “impractical” to climb into empty sky. But the impracticality pulls you like gravity in reverse.

With each upward stride, the air thickens into velvet midnight. Faint voices of friends and mentors echo behind you—kind, worried, perplexed:

“Come back before you catch cold!”
“You could fall!”
“Dreams don’t pay rent!”

Their words tumble and fade. They are not cruel, merely cautious. Even so, the lofted hush of your own desire drowns them out. The farther you climb, the more you sense that the staircase is adjusting itself to your heartbeat. It curls at impossible angles, like the spiral of a nautilus shell unfolding into infinity.

Halfway up, a doorway blooms from nothing—a pointed arch carved from moonstone. A plaque reads: ENTER ONLY IF YOUR LONGING OUTWEIGHS YOUR FEAR. You touch the handle, and it melts into silver vapor, permitting you through. On the other side lies a meadow balanced atop a single, colossal dandelion stem, swaying gently among aurora-borealis curtains. You realize that the meadow is your own conviction: fragile to outsiders, yet perfectly stable inside the logic of your dream.

In the meadow’s center stands an easel bearing a blank canvas. Beside it waits a paint set of impossible hues—colors unnamed by the waking world. You understand, with a shiver of certainty, that this canvas is the very reason you were drawn here, the “impractical” pursuit everyone doubted. You dip a brush into a pigment that feels like the sound of leaves catching sunlight, and you begin painting.

As you make the first stroke, the painted line floats off the canvas and becomes a ribbon of wind, circling your shoulders. Another stroke births a flock of paper cranes that ascend and arrange themselves into new constellations overhead. You are no longer merely painting; you are re-authoring the dream’s physics. Every brushstroke summons a thing that should not exist—and yet here it is, undeniable, irrefutably real because you willed it.

Down below, the critics’ telescopes shatter into harmless starlight. Their ledgers burst open, pages fluttering away like white moths. Even they look up, astonished, as your dandelion meadow drifts higher, trailing a luminous wake. You are beyond their governance now.

At last the canvas stands empty again—every image you created chose freedom over staying framed. You set down the brush, not with exhaustion but with fullness. Around you, the meadow glows brighter than noon. Somewhere inside the color, you hear a voice—your own, utterly unhesitating:

Keep climbing. Keep painting. Up here, impractical is just another word for undiscovered.

The staircase reappears at the meadow’s edge, extending onward through shimmering clouds. You step onto it anew, your pulse matching its hidden music. And as you rise, the dream widens and deepens in ways language can’t yet hold—because you’re busy inventing those ways, one impossible, authentic motion at a time.
