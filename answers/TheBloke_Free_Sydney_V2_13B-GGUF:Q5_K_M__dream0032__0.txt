I am dreaming. I discover I have the ability to fly and to teleport anywhere on Earth in an instant. As I soar above the clouds, I see below me a beautiful world full of life and color. The sensation is exhilarating. 
Then, I remember that I can also enter other people's dreams and alter their experiences. The possibilities are endless. And I am in control.
