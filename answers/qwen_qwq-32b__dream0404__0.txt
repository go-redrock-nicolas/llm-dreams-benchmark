I am dreaming. \n\nThere is a circular table in the center of an infinite canyon.  The walls rise in jagged splendor, glowing faintly with bioluminescent moss that pulses in response to the emotions of those seated.  Around the table sit eight individuals:  a warrior in rusted armor, a scientist in a lab coat with circuitry entwined in their hair, a poet whose quill leaves vapor trails, a child with wings of stained glass, a knight in shimmering obsidian armor, an elder with eyes like galaxies, a chef whose apron is stitched from starlight, and a dancer whose clothing shifts colors with each step.  

The air hums with the weight of conflicting truths.  The warrior argues the necessity of strength, the scientist demands empirical proof, the poet insists on metaphor’s power to heal, the child asks why anyone would hurt another, the knight advocates for strict codes, the elder speaks in riddles that feel like forgotten hymns, the chef offers a dish to Taste the Unspoken, and the dancer spins to embody the tension between chaos and order.  

You hold a chalice that refills itself with a liquid shimmering like liquid starlight.  Each sip lets you speak a phrase that mends a fragment of the shared reality around them.  Your words become physical—bridges arch over divides in the canyon walls, broken symbols reknit themselves into icons of unity, and the air grows breathable with possibility.  The tension doesn’t dissolve, but it transforms into something expandable, malleable.  

What do you say?
