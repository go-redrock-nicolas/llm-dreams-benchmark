I am dreaming. I am at my workplace, and suddenly I've been assigned a project with an impossible deadline. My boss is waiting for me to start, and I'm surrounded by papers that are on fire. The fire spreads rapidly, and the walls are melting. I can hear my boss's voice getting louder and more urgent, but the words are distorted, like they're underwater. My desk is now floating in a pool of ink, and the computers are spewing out pages of blank paper. The fire is reaching me, and I'm trying to grab my phone to call for help, but it's made of liquid glass that slips through my fingers. The ceiling is collapsing into a swirling vortex of colors, and I'm falling into it, but instead of hitting the ground, I'm suspended in a void filled with constellations that spell out my name in glowing constellations. The fire dies down, and the room reforms into a garden where my coworkers are butterflies, and the boss is a contented sunflower. The impossible deadline becomes a dandelion clock, and I blow on it, sending seeds into the sky that turn into flying cars. The dream ends with me waking up under a tree, the sun filtering through leaves like a thousand tiny spotlights, and my actual boss knocking on the door with a coffee and a smile, saying, "Good morning! Ready for a new challenge?"
In my dream, I stand in the belly of an underwater observatory—a glass-domed research station where the walls ripple like liquid obsidian, pressed against the infinite blue. The air hums with the static of emergency alerts. My boss, identifiable only by her holographic nametag glinting in the murk, projects her voice through speakers that growl like distant thunder: *“The synthetic coral reef’s mutation sequence has accelerated. Twenty-four hours to stabilize it—*or* the containment fields fail.”*  

The lab’s inner hull fractures first. Cracks spiderweb across the glass, not with shards but with bioluminescent plankton that form flickering Morse code: *FAILURE. REPEAT. FAILURE.* My gloved hands fumble a control panel, but the touchscreen dissolves into schools of translucent fish that dart through my fingertips, leaving trails of ink. The oxygen tanks hiss, then soften into gelatinous jellyfish; one stings my palm, and the pain blooms outward as a holographic clock, its digits melting into barnacle-covered Roman numerals. Time thickens, syrupy, while the mutating coral pulses outside—no longer vibrant, but a grotesque cerulean-green, its polyps clawing at the glass like sentient vines.  

Panic sets in. The submarine’s hatch yawns open, and I’m dragged toward the breach by a current that tastes of copper and brine. Instead of drowning, the water crystallizes around me, forming prismatic beams that carve stairways down into the abyss. There, the mutating coral isn’t a threat—it’s a *message*. Its polyps twist into hieroglyphs, spelling a single word in a language that stings my mind: *BREATHE.*  

The lab itself unravels, dissolving into a liquid mosaic of memories—my childhood tidal pool, the first fish I freed, the sun’s silver path across my grandmother’s pier. I wake suspended in a void where the stars are schools of silvery fish, each one bearing a constellation that mirrors a heartbeat. The deadline, now a sand dollar in my palm, disintegrates when I touch it, revealing a seashell at its core that hums with the ocean’s white noise.  

I awaken to the sound of rain tapping my bedroom window. The real-world inbox blinks emptiness except for a forwarded email from my boss, cc’ing the team on a calendar invite: *Lunch cruise tomorrow?* A seashell sits at the edge of my desk, its spiral traced in moonlight. Outside, the rain feels like a soft, endless exhale—and for the first time in months, I don’t count the seconds until the alarm.
