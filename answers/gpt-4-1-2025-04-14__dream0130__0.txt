I am dreaming.

Yet again, I stand ankle-deep in the ashen remnants of another life—bits of memory smoldering, ambitions and hopes twisting upward like wisps of wood smoke. Five times now I’ve constructed towers out of the rubble, driven splinters from failure out of my palms, and molded fresh paths through the chaos. Each time, I’d believed the worst was behind me—that I’d finally found the angle of ascent. But now, the ground is crumbling away beneath my feet once more, and the darkness above feels endless and absolute.

I stagger forward, the landscape all warped and surreal. A forest of giant clockwork machines groans around me, their gears grinding slow, bitter music. Their shadows stretch and coil, and I see behind them fleeting images from my former lives—warm kitchens, laughter echoing down sunny stairwells, an old dog that used to sleep at my feet, now just a shimmer of fur. I reach for these things, my hands trembling, grasping at the air, but every image dissolves like breath on glass.

There’s an ocean before me, black as spilled ink, and I feel its cold, magnetic pull. The sky is pierced by torn scraps of paper—letters I’ve written to people I loved and lost, all the words I never said. They flutter as if alive, spinning down onto the shingle at my toes.

I close my eyes. I have nothing left to build with. No more plans, no shields, no glib answers for heartbreak or ruin. Just breath and the thump of blood in my ears—a reminder that I am still here, even as everything else has gone.

Then, as if at the core of the dream, a warmth glimmers—a golden pulse thrumming somewhere beneath the water’s surface. I kneel to touch it, cold biting my skin, and the golden light flows into my fingers, up my arms, and behind my eyes. I feel—not hope, not yet—but a distant, flickering curiosity. What exists beyond this collapse? Who will I become without anything holding me up, or holding me back? If everything is lost, then everything is possible.

So I wade into the dark ocean, the waters parting around me like velvet curtains. I drag the golden glow onward, illuminating the depths—the bones of old mistakes, treasures sealed in barnacled chests, new seeds catching in the sand beneath shifting tides. I carry with me only this: a dogged refusal to vanish, and the stubborn, shimmering conviction that some beauty, some wonder, lives at the core of every ending.

I am dreaming, and in this fathomless dusk, I am already remaking myself, one slow luminous step at a time.
