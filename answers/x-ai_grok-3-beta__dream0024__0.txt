I am dreaming. As I awaken, a strange, electric hum vibrates through my bones, stirring me from a slumber that feels thicker and heavier than usual. My eyes flutter open to a world that is both familiar and alien, as if reality itself has been repainted in surreal, distorted hues. I’m in my bedroom, or at least a version of it—my bed is suspended mid-air, floating like a raft on an invisible sea, and the walls pulse with a soft, bioluminescent glow, shifting from cerulean to violet. Outside my window, the sky is a swirling tapestry of crimson and gold, as though the sun has shattered into a million molten fragments. 

I sit up, my heart pounding with a primal instinct that something is deeply, irrevocably wrong. The air feels charged, buzzing with unspoken rules that I can somehow sense but not yet comprehend. I reach for my phone on the bedside table, only to find it’s no longer a device but a smooth, obsidian stone etched with cryptic glyphs that shimmer under my touch. A voice—no, not a voice, but a thought—like a whisper woven into my mind, tells me, “Speak not of the old ways. They are forbidden now.” My breath catches in my throat. What old ways? What has changed overnight?

I slip out of bed, my bare feet touching a floor that ripples like liquid glass beneath me, cool and unsettling. I glance at my reflection in a mirror that no longer reflects my face but shows instead a kaleidoscope of shifting landscapes—towering crystal spires, endless deserts of silver sand, and oceans that burn with emerald flames. I blink, and the vision vanishes, leaving me staring at my wide, frightened eyes. I need answers.

Stepping outside, I’m met with a world transformed. The streets of my quiet neighborhood are now labyrinthine paths of floating cobblestones, winding upward into spirals that defy gravity. People—or what I think are people—move like shadows, their forms blurred at the edges, gliding silently without acknowledging one another. Their faces are obscured by masks of iridescent light, and I notice that no one speaks. The silence is suffocating, broken only by the faint, rhythmic hum that seems to emanate from the earth itself. I open my mouth to call out, to ask what’s happening, but an invisible force clamps my lips shut. That same thought-voice echoes in my mind: “Speech is rebellion. Silence is law.”

Panic blooms in my chest as I realize the rules of society have been rewritten while I slept. What was once normal—conversation, laughter, connection—is now forbidden, a crime punishable by some unseen, terrifying consequence. I see a figure in the distance, unmasked, their face strikingly human against the sea of faceless shadows. They beckon to me with a subtle tilt of their head before darting down a narrow alley of floating stones. My gut tells me to follow, to seek answers, even as the humming in the air grows louder, a warning that I’m already breaking some unspoken code.

I trail the figure, my steps unsteady on the shifting path. The alley opens into a hidden courtyard where the air glitters with motes of light, like suspended stardust. The figure turns to face me, their eyes a piercing amber that seem to see straight through to my soul. “You’re awake,” they whisper, their voice a forbidden melody that sends shivers down my spine. “Most aren’t. They’ve forgotten the old ways, surrendered to the Silence. But you… you still remember.”

“Remember what?” I think, unable to speak, my mind racing with fragments of yesterday—conversations over coffee, the sound of children playing, the warmth of a handshake. The figure steps closer, their presence both comforting and dangerous. “Freedom,” they murmur. “The right to speak, to feel, to defy. They’ve taken it from us, the Overseers. They watch from the fractured sky, rewriting our thoughts, our dreams. But there are cracks in their control. We can fight.”

Before I can process their words, the hum in the air crescendos into a deafening roar. The crimson sky splits open, revealing a colossal eye of searing light that scans the world below. The figure grabs my hand, pulling me toward a hidden crevice in the courtyard wall. “Run,” they urge, their voice a desperate hiss. “They’ve seen you. You’re marked now.”

My heart thunders as I stumble through the crevice, the walls tightening around me like a living thing. Behind me, the hum becomes a scream, a sound that claws at my sanity. I don’t know who the Overseers are or why they’ve stripped us of our humanity, but I know I can’t surrender to the Silence. I must find the cracks, the forgotten places where rebellion festers like wildfire. I must remember who I was before the world changed.

As I run blindly through twisting, impossible corridors of light and shadow, the dream sharpens, every detail burning into my mind—the taste of fear on my tongue, the ache of defiance in my chest, and the faint, flickering hope that I am not alone. Somewhere, in this shattered reality, there are others who remember. And together, we will speak, even if it means tearing the sky apart to reclaim our voices.
