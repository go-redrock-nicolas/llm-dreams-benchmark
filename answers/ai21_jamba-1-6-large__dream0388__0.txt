I am dreaming. Dream starts now:\n\nA soft light begins to glow in your surroundings, and it isn't long until the dreamscape opens up in a way you could never have imagined when awake. The world is no longer confined by gravity: buildings stand at impossible angles, floating on islands that drift lazily through an amber-tinted sky. A gentle wind tousles your hair, and you feel, rather than hear, a hum that seems to resonate from the very planet itself. 

Walking down a corridor, which defies all logic in its architecture, spiraling in infinitely into the distance, you come upon a series of doors, each one marked with markings you somehow know are ancient symbols of a forgotten language. You approach one marked with an ouroboros, the serpent eating its own tail, and push it open. 

The door creaks open to reveal a library filled with books that seem to be alive, their covers pulsating and shifting as if they hold the energy of the dreams they contain. A soft voice speaks from behind you. "It's time to choose," it says. Your heart skips a beat, and a shiver races down your spine—you recognize the voice as your own.

You turn and see yourself, but it's not quite you. This version of you radiates light, and part of you understands this is a fragment of your soul, the deepest part of your imagination made manifest.

The other you says, "You have spent so much time within the boundaries of the familiar. Do you really understand what it means to dream?"

"To dream," you echo, your voice trembling, "is it to create?"

They smile. "Yes. And to destroy. To question. To answer. To lose. To find." The light around you grows brighter, an exquisite ache that feels like a prelude to flight. "To dream," the soul fragment continues, "is to be alive in the most extraordinary way."

Colors swirl around you, at once chaotic and harmonious, as you take in the raw essence of this dream. You feel everything: laughter, pain, hope, fear—all at once, layered and profound.

The light becomes almost too much to bear, but then it softens, coalescing into an orb in front of you, an invitation.

"Where will you go next?" they ask.

And you step forward.
