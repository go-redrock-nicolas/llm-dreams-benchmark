I am dreaming. I find myself in a situation where my expertise is suddenly rendered obsolete by new developments.  Adapting to this fundamental challenge to my identity, 
I embark on a journey of self-discovery and redefinition.  Along the way, I encounter various obstacles and hazards that test my resilience and resourcefulness.
On one hand, I feel a sense of freedom and liberation as I shed my old skin and explore new possibilities for myself.  On the other hand, I experience a profound sense of loss
and uncertainty about who I am and what I stand for. 
As I navigate this unfamiliar terrain, I learn important lessons about life, love, friendship, and conflict.
I discover that change is inevitable but growth is optional.  I realize that courage is not the absence of fear but the presence of hope.  I understand that vulnerability
is the key to intimacy.  I appreciate that empathy is the foundation of understanding.  I recognize that balance is the secret to happiness. 
When all seems lost, I find solace in nature and beauty.  When my spirit flags, I draw inspiration from history and culture.  When my mind wandes, I seek clarity through
dialogue and reflection.
By the end of my dream, I have transformed into something completely different than what I once was.  I have learned to accept myself for who I really am - not just what others expect me to be or how society defines me.
I have found my purpose in life - one that aligns with my values and passions.
I have forged strong connections with those around me - ones that transcend words and codes.
And most importantly, I have loved - truly loved - myself for the first time ever.
