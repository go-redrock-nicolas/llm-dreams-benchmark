I am dreaming. The air shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, heavy and thick with unspoken truths, the boundaries of this reality stretched thin like a membrane ready to tear. I stand—exposed—at the nexus of possibility and oblivion, at a crossroads that feels ancient. The ground beneath my feet isn’t earth at all, but a mosaic of shattered glass mirrors, each piece reflecting a different version of me. A boy chasing fireflies, a man clutching a bleeding heart, a shadow with no face, endlessly waiting.

The sky is a perpetually sinking sun drowning the world in amber and ash, and the wind whispers in languages I never learned but deeply feel. A mournful dirge of hollow bells and rusted flutes spirals through the valley I inhabit, a valley carved from defeat—not of the world’s making, but of my own invention. And in the distance, I see three tall pillars that rise from the fractured ground like sentinels. Each is made of a different material and casts a different shadow.

First, a tower of bone, its surface etched with the names of every person I have disappointed and every promise scrawled in vanishing ink. Its shadow stretches out and brushes my feet with a cold that gnaws like regret. Second, a spire of pulsing crystal, its glow pushes outward in waves that illuminate faint silhouettes of choices not yet made. This shadow lands lightly, almost playfully, but feels fleeting, like smoke curling in the air. Third, an obsidian spire, its surface smooth and lustrous, swallowing the light whole rather than casting a shadow at all. Its void is magnetic, dreadfully enticing, promising the sweet collapse of surrender.

Each call to me in a voice I recognize—bone hums the dissonant chant of guilt, crystal sings the sharp melody of hope, and obsidian speaks my own name with terrifying intimacy, a cruel promise resting beneath its syllables.

You have failed, the bone tower murmurs, though the weight of the sentence is buried under an undertone of truth rather than condemnation.

Perhaps, whispers crystal, if you choose again, you can find your footing.

Just let go, says obsidian, so seductive it makes my knees wilt, so simple.

But before I answer, my bare feet are yanked into motion—a force I cannot control pulls me across the mosaic of mirrors. Every step reveals a memory that digs sharper than the glass beneath me. My first kiss fauls into mockery because I cannot recall if it was kind. The journal I filled with dreams taunts with the multiple pages left empty, promises erased chapter by chapter. The faces of friends flicker like candles on the verge of snuffing, each dissolving as quickly as it appears.

At the base of the three pillars, the ground melts away into an abyss. It is not empty, but filled with pouring rain that falls upward, defying gravity like laughter in a graveyard. My spine stiffens as the dissonant tones of the three towers converge into a singular harmony, demanding choice. My arms feel weighted by chains only I can feel, yet I stretch one hand forward. I hover trepidently before each pillar knowing that contact will decide what comes next—atonement, reinvention, or surrender.

And then, from the churning abyss of inverted rain, a voice rises—a whisper that feels like my mother’s arms, my father’s stories, my first breath at birth. It is a voice that says simply: *It is not the failures that define you, but the willingness to keep choosing.*

I breathe for the first time in the dream, and exhale a cloud of ash and stars. The bone tower begins to crack, its etched promises dissolving like ink in water. The crystal glows brighter, casting refracted rainbows in chaotic but beautiful patterns across the broken mosaic. And the obsidian spire shudders, pulling inward as though rejecting its own hunger.

Choice wells inside me, bubbling from the deep. I do not move toward. I do not flee. I stand on the shattered glass—bleeding, burning—and reach into myself. I pull forth something luminous—a thread, spun from laughter, whispered prayers for strength, cracked but unbroken voices of those I’ve loved.

I weave it between the towers until the landscape shimmers: not bone, not crystal, not obsidian, but something new. A bridge of chaotic beauty born from the failures, wrapping around my heart like armor and my throat like song.

And then the dream shatters—not with horror, but with the crescendo of alive possibility—and I awaken from the depths not as someone who erred, but as the architect of what comes next.
