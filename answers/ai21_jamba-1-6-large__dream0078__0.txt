I am dreaming. I am hired as a Navy SEAL, and our platoon is ambushed in a dense jungle area in Vietnam. Despite being outnumbered, I bravely charge into the fray, killing many Vietcong soldiers. My platoon retreats but I stay behind, thoughtlessly continuing to fight. Eventually, I am shot several times in the chest and fall to the ground, unable to move. As I lie there, a Vietcong soldier walks up to me with an AK-47 aimed at my face. As he pulls the trigger, I suddenly wake up gasping for air.
