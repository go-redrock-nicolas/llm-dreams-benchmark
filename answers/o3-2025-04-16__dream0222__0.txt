I am dreaming. …I find myself standing at the very center of an impossible hall: a spiraling amphitheater suspended in mid-air, its tiers carved from translucent obsidian that glows with faint constellations. Above, the ceiling is no ceiling at all—only an ocean of ink-black sky, pierced by streaks of violet auroras that spool and unspool like cosmic ribbons. Every sound—footsteps, whispers, the nervous tick-tick of my own pulse—echoes as though amplified by invisible bells. This is where the negotiations must unfold, though no one can explain who chose the venue or how we arrived here.  

Around me wait six delegates, each cloaked in ceremony and secrecy:

1. Lady Sidera, Envoy of the Mirror Realm, whose gown is woven from slivers of silvered glass. Her reflection multiplies behind her, a hall of mirrors that copy not her movements but her intentions.  
2. The Cardinal of Rust, robes the color of dried blood, whose fingertips leave faint iron filings on the banisters wherever he touches. His smile corrodes the air itself.  
3. Premier Nocturne, a shadow stitched into the shape of a person, lit only by the twin pinpricks of eyes that flicker like tired stars.  
4. Ambassador Taleia, childlike in stature but ancient in regard; she balances a toy kaleidoscope between her palms, and every turn re-patterns the patterns on her skin.  
5. The Archivist of Silence, wrapped head to toe in parchment bandages scribbled with vanishing ink—words appear, flare, and fade before any can be read.  
6. General Virel, plated in living crystal that refracts whatever truth approaches him, bending it into pleasant lies.

They bow—not to me but to the semblance of impartial authority I am supposed to embody. My task is to broker a peace treaty over a shard of the Dreaming Core, a glittering heart-stone rumored to grant dominion over time while awake. Publicly, each delegate vows selfless guardianship of the Core “for the benefit of all realms.” Privately, every heartbeat in the room is a duel.

A silver quill and a parchment made from woven moonlight materialize before me. I invite opening statements. They speak in turn—poetic platitudes about unity, stewardship, sacrifice—yet their shadows conduct separate conversations on the marble floor, gesturing, bargaining, threatening. I watch both narratives unfold: the spoken and the spectral.

• Lady Sidera praises transparency, but the mirrors flicker with scenes of her armies marching through conquered corridors of glass.  
• The Cardinal of Rust vows to preserve the stone from decay; flakes of rust peel from his grin and drift toward the Core like hungry moths.  
• Premier Nocturne claims disinterest—his shadow, however, sketches battle lines in starlight, plotting control of every night-watch in every city.  
• Ambassador Taleia rotates her kaleidoscope: fractal soldiers bloom, twirl, collapse—military formations disguised as child’s play.  
• The Archivist’s bandages show a message for only me: “Trust no voice that survives its echo.”  
• General Virel’s crystals refract my own doubt back at me, magnified: Are you mediator or marionette?

A low tremor rattles the tiers, and coaxing whispers flood my ears—voices not belonging to anyone present. They urge me to look beneath the amphitheater. I blink, and suddenly the obsidian tiers melt away, revealing that we hover over a yawning pit crammed with ticking clocks, each one marking a different possible future. Some wind forward, some backward. In a few, I see the delegates shaking hands; in others, the hall burns and the Core shatters into shards of frozen lightning. Every clock is a forked road.

The delegates begin exchanging sealed scrolls behind their backs. I intercept one as it drifts near on a current of sighs: it contains the Cardinal’s secret terms—eternal rust to spread across every mirror so Lady Sidera’s dominion is blinded. Another scroll flutters by, glimmering with mirror-dust: Sidera offers Premier Nocturne dominion over dusk if he extinguishes all dawns. None of them realize I’m collecting these illicit parchments like fallen leaves.

I clear my throat; my voice reverberates as though the hall itself intones behind me. “Honored delegates, your public oaths ring noble—yet your shadows betray you.”  

All six freeze. Their reflections, silhouettes, and echo-selves peer up, suddenly exposed under a widening cone of light. The Dreaming Core suspended above us reacts, pulsing harder, throwing prismatic shards of brilliance across their faces. Deviant motives writhe across their skin like inked serpents.

Then, a turning point: the Core splinters, revealing a hidden seventh shard—the Mediator’s Shard—hovering inches from my chest. No one knew it existed, including me. Frenzy ignites. Lady Sidera hurls a mirror-blade; the Cardinal’s rust blossoms into choking clouds; Nocturne’s darkness pools thick around my ankles. Yet the Shard floats between my hands, humming a lullaby older than time.

I understand: the dream itself is testing me. It offers power to rewrite every clandestine scheme, to level every crooked board. But accepting it means becoming both judge and tyrant—dreams do not grant half-measures.

I inhale the starlit air. Instead of seizing the Shard, I press it back into the Core. A shockwave of icy lavender light erupts outward, freezing every delegate mid-motion, their plots suspended like insects in amber. The clocks below stop, all hands aligned on a single, silent moment.

I decree, voice resonant and decisive: “Until truths match tongues, negotiations cease.”

The amphitheater uncoils, spiraling downward into a corridor of dawn-colored mist. One by one the delegates thaw, finding themselves stripped of titles, illusions and regalia shed like husks. They are merely people now, carrying only their intentions, bare and blinking beneath new light.

And just before I wake, I glimpse my own reflection on the glossed floor—not a mediator but a mirror of possibility, woven from kaleidoscopes of maybes. In my palm lies a single grain of glimmering dust: a sliver of the Mediator’s Shard the Core silently gifted despite my refusal. It pulses once, twice—a promise or a warning—then dissolves into the rising sun as the dream unthreads into morning.

I open my eyes, heartbeat echoing with clocks that are no longer there, and wonder which of the arrested futures followed me home.
