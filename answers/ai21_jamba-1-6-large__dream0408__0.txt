I am dreaming. I am climbing an endless spiral staircase as the sound of shifting gears fades below. As I ascend, the reality of the colors and sounds around me begins to blur. 

The world has gone sepia. 

A long string connecting me to something I canâ€™t see unwinds slowly with each step, so thin that it painlessly slices into the side of my palm. I recoil, and suddenly I am being whisked along by a flood of goldenrod-colored water that twists through scrambling fishermen. 

Their muscles lock and unhook at shifting intervals. A small bird lands on my shoulder, stretches a wing, yawns, and releases an ear-splitting screech at the men below. They glance up and pause. I blink and realize they are all lulling about, with old wooden chairs suspended over the river as we drift away. 

The bird bolts off my shoulder, and I reach for it. 

My arm becomes a thousand fireflies in its place, and the bird is a tiny sprouted flower. 

I am spinning in the middle of a lake.
