I am dreaming. The realization washes over me gradually, like warm honey spilling across consciousness. The world around me has taken on a luminescent quality—ordinary objects pulsing with gossamer threads of light that had always been there, yet somehow invisible to my waking eyes.

I stand in what seems to be a vast meadow, but each blade of grass radiates a gentle cobalt glow. As I focus my attention, I can see delicate strands of energy stretching between everything—connecting the dancing fireflies to the ancient oak trees at the meadow's edge, linking the night birds soaring overhead to the sleeping creatures nestled beneath the soil.

When I extend my hand, the threads respond—shimmering, vibrating with anticipation. They feel like liquid silk against my consciousness. I concentrate, and the tendrils of light bend toward me, coalescing into a pulsing sphere above my palm. It's not merely light but life itself—pure potential made visible.

With a gentle thought, I direct this gathered energy toward a withered sapling. The transformation is breathtaking—the threads weave themselves into the plant's being, and it unfurls upward in accelerated motion, branches reaching skyward as leaves burst forth in a cascade of emerald brilliance.

I discover I can send my awareness traveling along these connections, experiencing momentarily what it means to be a wolf loping through distant woods, feeling the exquisite sensation of a butterfly's wings unfurling from a chrysalis. Each living thing contains its own universe of sensation and meaning.

As my confidence grows, I begin orchestrating a symphony of energy—creating bridges between beings that normally never connect. A deer suddenly understands the ancient wisdom of the mountain stones; a falcon briefly shares its experience of wind-soaring freedom with the roots of trees below.

The boundaries between all living things become permeable, malleable. I am both myself and everything—a profound understanding that in this dream-reality, separation is the true illusion.
