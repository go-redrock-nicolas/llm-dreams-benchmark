I am dreaming. My subconscious mind is weaving a rich tapestry of emotions, thoughts, and experiences, transporting me to a realm both familiar and foreboding. As I navigate this inner world, I find myself wandering through a dense forest, the trees towering above me like sentinels of self-doubt. The air is heavy with the scent of uncertainty, and the soft rustle of leaves whispers secrets in my ear, tempting me to question my every move.

I am drawn to a clearing, where a figure stands shrouded in mist. As I approach, the vapor begins to dissipate, revealing a person whose face is a mosaic of all those who have withheld approval from me in the past. Their features shift and morph, like a kaleidoscope of disappointment and rejection. I feel an aching sense of longing, a deep-seated desire to earn their validation, to prove myself worthy of their recognition.

But with each attempt to seek their approval, the figure remains elusive, always just out of reach. I extending a hand, only to have it met with a dismissive wave, a whispered "not good enough," or a cold, unyielding silence. The pain of rejection stings, like a drop of ice water on a winter's night, leaving me shivering and uncertain.

As I continue to seek approval, the scene shifts and repeats itself, like a recurring nightmare. I find myself in a grand, empty hall, where I stand before a panel of judges, each one a manifestation of my own self-doubt. They scrutinize me, their eyes piercing and unforgiving, as I try to justify my worth. I speak, but my words are met with skepticism, my accomplishments dismissed as insignificant.

The dream intensifies, and I feel myself becoming lost in a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflection revealing a different facet of my own self-doubt. I see a child, eager for praise, only to be met with criticism and disdain. I see an adult, striving for success, only to be belittled and marginalized. The reflections swirl around me, a dizzying array of "not good enoughs" and "you're not worthy," until I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of self-doubt.

And yet, even as the dream threatens to consume me, I sense a glimmer of awareness, a spark of recognition that this pattern of seeking approval from those who withhold it is a cycle I can break. I begin to see that the true source of validation lies within myself, that I am the one who must learn to approve of myself, to acknowledge my own worth and deservingness.

As this realization dawns, the dream begins to shift, like the first light of dawn creeping over the horizon. The forest, the figures, and the reflections begin to fade, replaced by a warm, golden light that fills me with a sense of peace and self-acceptance. I feel my heart expand, my soul unfold, as I embrace the truth that I am enough, just as I am. The dream dissolves, leaving me with a sense of liberation, a newfound understanding that I am the one who must give myself the approval I seek, and that this approval is the key to unlocking my true potential.
