I am dreaming. ---

**The Dream of Shattered Stars**

You are standing on a bridge made of liquid starlight, arcs of silver and cobalt dripping like molten glass into the void below. The air hums with the song of distant nebulae, a chorus of whale-like calls that shudder through your ribs. Your friend stands at the bridge’s center, their silhouette fraying at the edges, dissolving into smoke and static. You’ve known them for lifetimes—or is it minutes? Dreams warp such things. Their eyes are galaxies, swirling with supernovae and secrets.

“I’m dying,” they say, but the words aren’t spoken. They bloom in your mind like ink in water. *“Not my body. My… essence. The thing that *is* me.”* A crack splits the bridge beneath your feet, and through it, you see memories that don’t belong to you: a childhood birthday party where the cake bursts into spiders, a kiss that left frostbite on their lips, a whispered pact you both made under a blackened moon. But *you don’t remember this*. 

Their voice fractures. *“You were there. You were always there. But I—I’ve been unraveling us. Feeding parts of you… to the void. To keep myself whole.”* 

You step closer. The stars in their eyes gutter like candle flames. Their hands, now translucent, reach for you. When they touch your chest, your heartbeat becomes a drum of distant thunder, and you *see*: threads of gold and shadow stitching your soul to theirs. But half the threads are severed, dangling into nothingness. The severed ends *move*, squirming like headless serpents.

*“Every lie I told you,”* they whisper, *“was a knife. Every smile, a theft. I didn’t want to be alone when it took me.”* 

The bridge disintegrates. You’re falling through kaleidoscopic darkness, their confession echoing. Then—impact. You land in a meadow of glass flowers, each petal reflecting a different version of your friend: laughing, screaming, dissolving. One reflection shows them cradling a shriveled, screaming thing—a doppelgänger of you, emaciated and glowing faintly. *They’ve been grafting your light into their fading core.*

You wake with a gasp, the taste of stardust still sharp on your tongue. Your pillow is damp. Down the hall, faintly, you hear someone weeping.
