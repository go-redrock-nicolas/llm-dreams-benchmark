I am dreaming. I am standing on a shore where the water is liquid mercury, glinting in the sun with a cold, silvery light. The sky pulses like a heartbeat, a slow throbbing between indigo and violet. There's an island ahead, but no boat—so I wade in, feeling the mercury’s weightless drag, colder than any ocean, numbing my skin. When I reach the island, it’s a labyrinth made of coral, translucent and pink. At its center is a door made of pure sound, humming a chord that vibrates in my ribs.
Deep within the labyrinth of coral, the door of sound parts like a sigh, revealing a cavern where two rivers flow in opposite directions, their waters carrying the colors of sunset and twilight. On one bank stand figures cloaked in fabrics that shift hues with their emotions—crimson when stirred by fury, gold when warmed by resolve. Across the roaring currents, others are draped in stone-like garments, etched with symbols that glow faintly as they speak, their voices echoing with the weight of ancient texts. 

The leaders of each group approach the river’s edge, their figures towering. One, a woman with hair like living flames, declares, "Your rigid stones suffocate growth; only in fluid change can truth evolve!" Her counterpart, a man with skin like polished obsidian, counters, "Without bedrock, there is no foundation—your flames burn away the wisdom of the earth." The rivers churn, colors clashing into chaotic swirls where their currents meet.

You step between them, hands raised. "You both thirst," you say, noticing the cracked clay cups clutched in their grips, filled with waters that mirror their own rivers. "But what if the answer isn’t *how* you drink, but what you pour *after*?" You lean down, scoop a handful from each river, and pour them together into a hollowed agate lying forgotten at your feet. The merging liquid doesn’t clash—it *weaves*, becoming a shimmering liquid prism, refracting light into spectra neither color nor shadow could alone create.

The crowd falls silent. The flame-haired woman tilts her head, her hair dimming to amber. The stone-clad man’s etchings flicker brighter, almost *warming*. A young initiate from the fluidists steps forward, offering their own cup, which you fill with prism-light. When the liquid contacts their skin, it doesn’t burn or harden. It *sings*, a note identical to the door’s hum in your dream. 

One by one, the groups begin to exchange cups, their garments beginning to bleed tentative hues into each other’s stones, symbols dissolving into patterns that ripple like fabric. The rivers’ currents slow, their confluence now a tapestry of all colors under twin moons rising—one molten and flowing, the other crystalline and stable. 

You awaken, the after-vibe of the door’s hum still resonant in your throat, the taste of mercury and light lingering on your tongue. But in your palm lies the agate, its prism still glowing faintly, a key—or perhaps a warning—that harmony isn’t the erasure of difference, but the reinvention of how difference is held.
