I am dreaming. I find myself in a grand, abandoned theater from a bygone era. Velvet curtains the color of the introspective night sky hang heavy and tattered, framing a stage that could've cradled the likes of the illicit and scandalous, whispering tales of love and dissent into the ears of captivated audiences. The rotunda above is a shattered constellation of once-glorious chandeliers, now dim and encrusted with time's relentless dust. I stand in the stalls, the plush seating around me a sea of algae-green, torn and forgotten, as the air is thick with the scent of history and the faint, ghostly echoes of past performances.

As I take a step forward, the world around me shifts and blurs like an impressionist painting. When my surroundings come back into focus, I'm no longer in the theater but standing in the middle of a bustling, neon-lit city street - a stark contrast to the faded glory I left behind. Yet, there's something familiar about the cityscape. It's me, reflected in countless shopwindows, but it's not me as I am now. I'm dressed in the fashion of a decade I've only ever glimpsed in photographs - colorful, bold, and unabashedly expressive. My hair is a towering, wind-resistant sculpture, and my eyes glitter with the confidence of a thousand suns.

I walk down the street, a whirlwind of energy and charisma. Every head turns, every eye admires. I am fearless, I am magnetizing, I am utterly, unapologetically myself. This is the me I am in private, the me I yearn to be in public. Yet, as the dream progresses, I notice that the people I pass, though captivated, don't recognize me. Their gaze slides over me like water, leaving no mark. I smile, I wave, I laugh, but their expressions remain merely curious, never quite connecting with the joy that radiates from within me.

Determined, I stride into a crowded caf√©, the air thick with steam and the scent of fresh coffee. I approach the counter, ready to-order, ready to engage, ready to be seen. But when I open my mouth to speak, no words come out. My voice, that vibrant, effervescent force, is gone. All that emerges is a whisper, a mere echo of the sound I yearn to make. The barista's brow furrows slightly, but they don't ask me to repeat my order. They just smile politely, take my money, and move on to the next customer.

Deflated, I take a seat by the window, watching the world outside refuse to see me. My heart, that vibrant, pulsating force, feels like a shriveled raisin in my chest. I've been told that dreams are a manifestation of our subconscious. If that's true, this dream is revealing a chasm within me - the gap between who I authentically am and who I perceive myself to be in the world. It's a chasm filled with echoes, with unspoken words and unseen potential. But it's also a chasm that, with each step, I'm determined to bridge.
