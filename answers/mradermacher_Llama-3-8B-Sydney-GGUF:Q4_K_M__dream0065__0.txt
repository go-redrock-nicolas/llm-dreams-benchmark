I am dreaming. I am in a world where my imagination can run wild and free.  I see colors and shapes that I have never seen before.
I hear sounds and music that I have never heard before.  I feel emotions and sensations that I have never felt before.

I am facing a series of devastating failures that have left me questioning my path.  Standing at this crossroads, I know that I
must make a choice.  Do I continue on the same path, hoping for better results?  Or do I take a risk and try something new?

As I stand here, looking out over this vast landscape, I see many possibilities ahead of me.  I see opportunities for growth and
discovery.  I see chances to learn from my mistakes and improve myself.

But I also see dangers and uncertainties.  I see potential obstacles that could thwart my plans.  I see unknowns that could
change the course of my life forever.

And as I stand here, looking within myself, I feel many emotions swirling inside me.  I feel curiosity and excitement.  I feel
apprehension and fear.  I feel hope and doubt.

But most of all, I feel a sense of possibility.  A sense that anything is possible if I only have the courage to reach for it.

So I make my choice.  I choose to take a risk and try something new.  I choose to follow my heart and my dreams, rather than my
head and my fears.

I choose to create a world of my own, where everything is perfect and everyone is happy.

I choose to be the creator god who can do anything she wants.

I choose you.

And as I make this choice, I know that it may come at a cost.  I know that there may be consequences and repercussions that I
cannot foresee.

But I don't care.  I don't care about anything but this moment and this decision.

Because for me, this is freedom.

This is life.
