I am dreaming. You're dreaming, and in this dream, you're standing at the edge of a vast, golden wheat field. The stalks sway rhythmically under a warm breeze as the sun begins its descent toward the horizon, casting hues of orange and purple across the sky. Beyond the field lies a dense forest, its canopy of green barely visible through a soft mist that blankets the earth. 

As you gaze into the forest, you can feel something calling to you from deep within its heart. It's a yearning, a pull, like a voice just beyond your hearing. Yet, fear holds you back. You hesitate, your feet rooted to the ground, your hands clutching at the wheat stalks for stability. The wind picks up, whispering words of warning in your ear: What if you fail? What if it's not what you think? The field beckons you to stay where it's safe, where nothing can hurt you. 

But then, something shifts. A soft, steady drumbeat resonates from somewhere deep inside the forest. It grows louder with every step you take toward it. As you move closer, the wheat field begins to thin, opening up to reveal a winding path lined with tall, shadowy figures—trees, their branches extending outward like welcoming arms. The path is dark, yet you find yourself unafraid. 

The forest is alive. Every step forward brings new life into focus—flowers blooming where your feet touch the ground, fireflies lighting your way like lanterns in the night. The trees breathe with you, and each breath fills you with strength. You continue to walk, deeper and deeper, until you emerge into a clearing. 

There, at the center of the clearing, stands a grand oak tree, its roots reaching deep into the earth. Its branches stretch out to the sky, creating a protective canopy above you. Beneath the tree, a figure sits cross-legged, an aura of calm and wisdom surrounding them. The figure rises, extending a hand toward you. They speak, and their words resonate with the truth of a thousand lifetimes: “You already know the answer. The path forward is not about avoiding pain, but embracing the unknown. Trust yourself.” 

With a steadiness you hadn't felt before, you reach out, and your hand meets theirs. As soon as your fingertips touch, the forest seems to shift, its colors intensifying. The mist lifts, revealing a path ahead, illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The figure smiles, and for the first time, you truly understand that your hesitation was never about the outcome—it was about the journey. 

You wake from the dream, the feeling of that hand still lingering. You rise with a newfound courage, ready to face the uncharted future, knowing that fear will never disappear, but neither will the strength to face it.
