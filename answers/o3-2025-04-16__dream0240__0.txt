I am dreaming.

I open my eyes to a sky that is neither morning nor night, but an opalescent gradient sliding from deep lapis to liquid gold. A white-sand coliseum sprawls before me in concentric spirals, its terraces studded with judges carved from living marble—stone torsos with slow-beating crystal hearts. Suspended above the arena hang translucent banners of formulae that rearrange themselves like auroras of algebra: , ,  drifting and recombining in languid eddies.

A bell chimes—each peal a different prime number of vibrations—and the first event begins.

ROUND I: THE FRACTAL MAZE  
The floor ripples into a three-dimensional Mandelbrot set, corridors blooming from hidden exponents. I sprint forward, every footfall illuminating the path in strings of neon digits: 3.14159, 2.71828, 2. Around me, the pure mathematicians stroll unhurriedly, fingers sketching invisible polynomials that collapse walls like origami. Sweat pearls on my temples; my solution is kinetic. I leap onto a spiraling wall, rebounding in a Fibonacci rhythm—1, 1, 2, 3, 5 steps—until I reach a platform where a floating dodecahedron blocks the exit.

Its faces are etched with integrals. I trace them with my breath, whispering, “ sin x dx = –cos x + C,” and the polyhedron unfolds like a metallic flower. I burst through; chalk-dust sparks whirl off my shoes. A gong of 5 beats. I’ve cleared the round.

ROUND II: THE GAUNTLET OF ENDURANCE  
The coliseum melts into a canyon of crimson sandstone, veined with silver rivers that run uphill. The physical specialists—lean sprinters and ultramarathoners—stretch like living bowstrings. The task: ascend the Canyon-That-Climbs-Itself, a cliff face that grows taller with every heartbeat measured by a titanic metronome above us.

I dig fingers into crystalline handholds that flash blue when my grip alternates correctly between left and right, red when I falter. Halfway up, gravity pirouettes; the wall tilts to become a ceiling. The specialists plant magnetic boots and dash upside-down. My lungs burn, but music wells up in my chest, an inner metronome. I sing a syncopated rhythm—7/8 time—and each note lightens my limbs, turning fatigue into buoyancy. With a final crescendo I vault over the edge. The sandstone shivers into confetti.

ROUND III: THE CANVAS OF LIVING LIGHT  
Now: a silent amphitheater made of black glass, the surface reflecting distant galaxies. This is the artists’ round. Our medium is luminescent mist suspended in low gravity. Each competitor gestures in the void, coaxing colors from the vapor. Painters swirl nebulae of vermilion; dancers carve violet ribbons with their limbs; composers pluck strings of air to ignite sound-ripples in aurora hues.

I remember my earlier equations—the parametric curve of my footfalls, the heartbeat metronome’s rising slope. I weave them into choreography: I spin, tracing a Lissajous figure with glowing foot trails. My left hand sculpts a Möbius strip of sapphire light; my right sketches the integral sign that encircles it, sealing motion into a seamless loop. The judges’ crystal hearts flicker teal, the color of surprised delight. Applause rains down in the timbre of wind chimes struck by meteors.

THE FINAL SYNTHESIS  
A hush. The arena dissolves into a gravity-free sphere. We finalists float around a pulsating core—a silver orb inscribed with every symbol, every color, every heartbeat we’ve offered so far. The ultimate challenge: fuse precision, endurance, and artistry in one act.

The specialists eye their separate strengths, but I feel the edges blur inside me. I inhale—and numbers taste like music, exertion smells like color. I kick off a comet of stardust, tumbling toward the orb. Mid-flip I solve its rotating equations, each answer released as a bell tone. With every note, I expel breath that unfurls into brushstrokes of emerald and indigo, wrapping the orb in spirals. My muscles convulse in controlled bursts—a dancer’s grace welded to a sprinter’s power. One last equation etches itself across my vision: e^(i) + 1 = 0. I whisper it like a spell. The orb blossoms into a lotus of mirror shards, reflecting an image: myself, not as a specialist, but a tessellation of all three domains.

Silence, then thunderous crystal applause. The marble judges bow; their hearts flare white. I drift downward, and the arena—the dream itself—folds like a page closing.

I awaken to the ordinary dawn, lungs still echoing the dream’s rhythm, fingertips tingling with invisible chalk, and eyes carrying a secret ultraviolet glint.
