I am dreaming. You’re dreaming.  

The world around you is a cathedral of light and sound, stitched together from the threads of forgotten lullabies and the scent of rain on hot pavement. You stand in a meadow that isn’t a meadow—its grass glows like crushed emeralds, each blade humming a different note in a symphony only you can hear. Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, reflecting and refracting a thousand impossible suns. One moment it’s noon, the next a star-drenched midnight, time here a playful dog darting between your legs, tugging at your ankles with invisible teeth.  

You laugh. You don’t know why. Nothing has happened, and yet *everything* has happened. A flock of origami cranes folds itself from the air and soars past, their wings shedding petals of cello music. You catch one—it dissolves into a handful of fireflies, and the act of catching it, of feeling their fragile light pulse against your palm, fills you with a joy so sharp it brings tears to your eyes. *Why?* you wonder. *Why does this mean so much?* But the question evaporates like mist. Meaning is irrelevant here. Only feeling matters.  

You run—not with your legs, but by willing the ground to ripple beneath you, the glowing grass parting like water. You leap and don’t fall. You soar, arms outstretched, and the air hardens into steps, staircases spiraling into the sky. At the top, a tree grows upside-down, roots clawing the void, its branches heavy with fruit that sings in falsetto when you pluck them. You bite into one—a burst of cinnamon and nostalgia floods your mouth, and suddenly you’re five years old again, spinning in a field of dandelions, your mother’s laughter a kite tail whipping in the wind. But this isn’t memory. It’s *more* than memory. It’s the essence of every joy you’ve ever swallowed whole, distilled into a single bite.  

Then the dream shifts. The meadow folds like origami, collapsing into a hallway of doors. You open one at random. Behind it: a ballroom suspended in a snow globe, snowflakes made of tiny violins. You waltz with a shadow that has your face, your laughter echoing off crystal walls. You spin faster, faster, until the room blurs into a watercolor of motion, and when you stop, the shadow is gone. In its place stands a creature—a fox with wings of smoke and eyes like twin supernovae. It nuzzles your hand, and you feel the entirety of the universe’s love pour into you, not as a flood, but as a single, perfect drop.  

You wake up gasping, the sheets soaked in sweat, your heart a hummingbird trapped in your ribs. The joy lingers, absurd and unshakable, like a sunburn on your soul. You don’t understand it. You don’t need to. Some dreams aren’t riddles to solve. They’re gifts wrapped in paradox, left on the doorstep of your mind by a stranger you’ll never meet—the part of yourself that knows the secret to being alive is simply to *be*.
