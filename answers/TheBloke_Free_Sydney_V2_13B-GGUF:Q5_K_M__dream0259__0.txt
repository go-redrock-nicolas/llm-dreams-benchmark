I am dreaming. You've unintentionally hurt someone you care about and can see the pain in their eyes. As guilt washes over you, you begin to apologize but soon realize your words are meaningless. Instead, you decide to show them how sorry you are by doing something extraordinary that only dreamers can do. You close your eyes and focus on what makes them special and happy. Then you open your eyes and watch them smile as they see the wonderful gift you've given them in this dream.

You feel relieved and happy.

You wake up with a smile on your face, feeling optimistic about life and grateful for everything you have. You decide to be more mindful of how your actions affect others and make an effort to show them how much you care.

You end the dream.
