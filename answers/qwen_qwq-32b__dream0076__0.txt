I am dreaming. 5 minutes before performing a skill to a global audience, I spot a fatal mistake. My hands blur as I try to correct it, sweat dripping. The camera’s laser spotlight feels heavier than stone. A voice booms, "Three minutes!" My fingers tremble. I try to breathe, but it feels wrong. The crowd’s murmur is a living entity, echoing my fear. I glance down—my hands are morphing, fingers elongating into eight endless tendrils. Panicked, I stare at them, aghast. My heartbeat echoes like gunshots in my ears. "Time’s up!" Before I can scream, aToolkit flies at me, slicing through my altered hands. I try to grab it but my arms are now solid marble. A shadowy figure appears, whispering, "Swallow the clock." My vision blurs; the Toolkit disintegrates into shattered smoke. I open my mouth, the metallic taste of time flooding my throat. Darkness swallows me whole as the crowd's roar fades to silence.
