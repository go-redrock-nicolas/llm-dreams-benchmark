I am dreaming. I'm monitoring a quantum-level experiment where minuscule measurement errors could have catastrophic consequences. When my instruments begin showing contradictory readings, I feel my heart quicken in my chest. The laboratory around me—sterile white walls bathed in the cool blue glow of quantum containment fields—suddenly feels both claustrophobic and limitlessly vast.

My colleagues' voices fade to muffled echoes as I lean closer to the display. The quantum particles are simultaneously in all possible states and none at all—an impossibility even by quantum standards. The readouts flicker: entangled particles communicating faster than light across impossible distances, probability waves collapsing into patterns that resemble ancient symbols.

Suddenly, the floor beneath me becomes transparent. I'm standing on nothing, gazing down into an infinite regression of laboratories, each containing a version of myself looking increasingly concerned. Above me, the same infinite chain extends upward. I realize with mounting dread that our experiment has fractured reality itself.

The particles we're measuring aren't just responding to observation—they're observing us back. The boundaries between observer and observed dissolve. My consciousness begins to disperse, simultaneously experiencing every possible outcome of every decision I've ever made or will make.

The walls of the laboratory peel away like petals, revealing not the expected campus grounds but a vast cosmic landscape where stars pulse like neurons in a universal mind. I understand then: our experiment wasn't measuring reality—it was creating it. Every calculation, every measurement we've made has been a thought in the mind of something far greater than ourselves.

As this revelation crashes over me, the contradictory readings suddenly harmonize into a single, perfect equation that contains everything—past, future, matter, thought. It's beautiful and terrible in its simplicity. I reach out to touch the screen, knowing that doing so will either save or unravel existence itself...

And then I wake up.
