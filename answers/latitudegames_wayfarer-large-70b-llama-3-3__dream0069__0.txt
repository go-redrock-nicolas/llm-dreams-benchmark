I am dreaming. I stand in a lush meadow bathed in ethereal moonlight, the air alive with possibilities. First, I focus on a nearby patch of soft, dewy grass, my voice taking on a lilting melody like a woodland fairy's song. As I sing, the blades of grass transform, lengthening and changing texture until they become luxurious strands of emerald silk that flow in an invisible breeze like a verdant river.

Next, I turn my attention to an ancient oak tree, its gnarled branches reaching towards the starry sky. My voice soars higher, taking on a powerful operatic quality as I intone an aria. The rough, weathered bark transforms, its surfaces smoothing and losing all color until the entire tree is a gleaming pillar of polished silver, reflecting the moonlight with perfect clarity as if it were a giant mirror.

Feeling bolder, I approach a large boulder jutting from the ground like an earthy sentinel. My song becomes deeper and more rhythmically complex, a haunting chant that reverberates through the meadow. As I vocalize, the stone melts away, transmuting into a pool of cool water that ripples as if touched by unseen hands. I step into it, feeling it respond to my form, becoming a liquid mirror that perfectly duplicates my appearance as I move.

Encouraged by my successes, I experiment with a piece of rusty wrought iron fencing. My voice takes on a playful, almost gymnast-like follicking quality, and the metal wires twist and spiral, weaving themselves into intricate patterns and shapes. What was once a simple barrier now resembles a living sculpture of dancing black flames, each tendril of metal moving in perfect synchronization with my song.

Finally, I turn my attention to the night sky itself. With a swirling crescendo of sound, I weave a symphony of impossible complexity, using every vocal style and technique I can imagine. As my voice soars to impossibly high notes, the stars rearrange themselves, constellations dissolving and reforming into patterns I recognize - maps of fantastical lands, diagrams of ancient machines, the faces of forgotten gods all briefly visible before shifting again. The dream sky becomes a canvas of ever-changing lights, responding to my voice as if the very fabric of reality were a living instrument.
