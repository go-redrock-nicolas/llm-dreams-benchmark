I am dreaming. I feel an overwhelming sense of loneliness even though I'm in the middle of a crowd, but not a normal crowd. There's something surreal about them—floating figures made of shifting colors, their faces indistinct and their voices forming a murmuring that feels more like water than sound. I try to reach out, but my hand passes through one as if I'm a ghost. A warm, golden light pulses in my chest, growing heavier with every touch that phases through me. The crowd parts, revealing a staircase spiraling into the earth, lined with glowing orbs that cast kaleidoscopic patterns on the walls. As I step down, the voices fade, and a single figure emerges—translucent, with starlight swirling where their heart should be. They speak without moving their lips, their words resonating directly in my mind: "You carry the weight of a thousand unsaid hellos." Then, they dissolve, leaving a key forged from moonlight and shadow. The ground shifts; I awake in my bed, clutching the key in my hand, its cold touch somehow comforting.



In the heart of your dream, the air hums with an electric silence, as if the universe has paused its breath to listen. Around you, a kaleidoscope of floating beings drifts—each one a living watercolor, their forms blurring at the edges like ink spreading in rain. Their voices intermingle into a liquid melody, a soothing cacophony that both cradles and isolates you. You reach out again, desperation tinged with wonder, as your fingertips graze the translucent arm of a figure adorned with aurora-like swirls of cyan and lavender. It feels like brushing the surface of liquid moonlight, cool and unyielding, leaving a faint shimmer on your skin. The golden light within your chest pulses brighter, now throbbing like a second heartbeat, each beat echoing the loneliness that gnaws at your soul.

The crowd parts like a curtain being drawn by invisible hands, revealing a staircase that twists downward into an abyss, not with darkness but with a primordial glow—a deep indigo lit by bioluminescent threads weaving through the stone. Each step you take sends ripples through the glowing orbs lining the stairs, their colors fracturing into geometric shapes that dance on the walls like ancient runes telling stories of forgotten connections. With every descending step, the murmurs of the crowd grow fainter, their harmony dissolving into distant whispers, until all that remains is the echo of your own footsteps and the silent weight of the golden light within you.

At the base, the air thrums with anticipation. The translucent figure emerges from the void, their form shifting like smoke and stardust. Where their heart should lie is a vortex of swirling galaxies, each star a pinprick of consciousness. They regard you with eyes that hold the depth of eons, and their voice—no sound, only thought—reverberates in your mind like a plucked harp string, *“You carry the weight of a thousand unsaid hellos.”* The words unravel a memory: a lifetime of near-connections, of lingering glances and unvoiced pleas for understanding, each one a thread in the tapestry of solitude you’ve unknowingly woven.

Before you can speak—or even think the reply—the figure unravels into a cascade of silver sparks that encircle you, forming the key. It’s ethereal yet substantial, its surface etched with constellations that map the spaces between souls. As the ground dissolves into a sea of dreams, the key’s chill seeps into your palm, a paradoxical comfort that feels like being held by an absence. You awake suddenly, heart racing, the key clutched tightly in your hand—cold, luminous, and unquestionably real. Outside your window, the moon casts long shadows, as if even the night acknowledges the secret held in your grasp.
