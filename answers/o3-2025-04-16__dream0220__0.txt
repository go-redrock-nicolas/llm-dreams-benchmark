I am dreaming.

I drift through a corridor of mauve fog, hearing my own footfalls echo inside an enormous seashell sky. A brass door marked “BEHAVIOR INVERTED” swings open, and I spill into a plaza the color of moonstone. This is the Borough of Contradia, a city-state whose citizens have flipped every social instinct I’ve ever trusted.

At once a local strides up—an elegant figure in a coat stitched from mirror shards—and scowls. The scowl is radiant, theatrical, a bouquet of wrinkles. Here, scowls are greetings. I remember reading somewhere that a smile is a baring of teeth, an act of aggression in the animal kingdom. In Contradia that subtext reigns: to smile is to threaten. So when I instinctively grin back, the crowd gasps, clutching pearls of petrified pollen hung around their necks. To repair my faux-pas, I frown with all the weight of abandoned cities. Applause erupts. I have said hello correctly at last.

Streets branch like lightning bolts rather than grids, because in Contradia linear predictability is considered lazy. Buildings lean toward one another at precarious angles, trading shadows. Windows are on the floors, rugs hang on walls, chandeliers sprout from sidewalks. Citizens stand with their backs toward conversational partners—face-to-face is deemed intrusive. Ears point forward, eyes politely averted.

I’m escorted to a tea house shaped like a spiraling nautilus. Inside, patrons are locked in passionate silence: hush is praise, chatter is disrespect. A server glides up, never lifting her gaze from the ceiling, and slams a porcelain cup on the table so hard that tea geysers up in perfect spheres that hover, trembling, before settling back inside. Slamming, here, is delicacy. Placing something gently suggests indifference. I attempt a timid thud—only a dull clack. A nearby elder clicks his tongue, the equivalent of a standing ovation.

To introduce myself authentically without trampling their mores, I choose words carefully. In Contradia, an apology means you’re proud; “Thank you” means you object. The polite phrase for gratitude is “I resent this deeply,” delivered with a gravely respectful bow. So I say: “I resent this deeply, host of the shimmering tea.” My voice shakes, but the room shivers in collective delight—porcelain clinking like wind chimes.

Even affection is inverted. Partners court one another by pretending not to know each other’s names. A bold romantic gesture is to forget someone’s birthday with ceremonial flair, then recite embarrassing childhood stories in reverse order. Public snubbing is devotion; private attention is casual. I watch two lovers on a balcony: they turn their backs, shout each other’s flaws to the city, then part ways smiling inwardly (which here is invisible). Overhead, banners read: “MAY YOUR NEGLECT BE TRUE.”

Night crashes in—literally, the sky smashes like stained glass, shards falling upward into new constellations. A festival begins: the Carnival of Contradictions. Parade floats move backward. Drummers strike the underside of their drums; the resulting bass notes whoosh up through the ground. People exchange gifts only to have recipients hand them back at once—because giving is proving you can let go, receiving is refusing to burden the giver. I bring out the travel journal in my coat, scribble a poem, and offer it to a child. She returns it with a solemn nod. In their eyes, I have honored the poem by keeping it.

To maintain authenticity amid this topsy-turvy splendor, I craft a tiny ritual: I will carry my own culture inside me while outwardly dancing to theirs. When someone insults my shoes (high praise), I mutter a gentle compliment under my breath (my secret truth). When they applaud my mistakes, I celebrate the shared laughter, knowing that across both maps of manners we have met at joy.

At dawn, the seashell sky glows rose-gold. The citizens of Contradia gather to bid farewell. Custom dictates they shout, “Leave quickly, stranger!”—a benediction of safe passage. I oblige, sprinting across a bridge woven from negative space, where each step lands on a patch of absence. The city recedes behind me like a dream folding its wings.

I awaken on my own bed, the dawn outside simply…dawn. Yet when I reach for my journal, I find the pages reversed, right-to-left, ink fluorescing with faint moonstone shimmer. Contradia’s rules linger in the margin notes: “Hold contradictions gently; they are the pulse of possibility.” I smile—an act of defiance in their land, an act of warmth in mine—and close the book, carrying both worlds in balanced opposition.
