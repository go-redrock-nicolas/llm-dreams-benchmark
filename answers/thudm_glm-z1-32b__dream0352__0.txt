I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, endless desert under a sky of swirling, liquid mercury.

The ground beneath me is made of grains of obsidian, each one sharp and reflective.  As I walk, my footsteps don’t leave any marks, as though the desert is alive and constantly reshaping itself to erase any evidence of my passage.

In the distance, I see a towering archway made of interlocking cubes of different colors - blue, gold, crimson, and emerald.  The cubes are stacked in such a way that they defy gravity, each one hovering mere centimeters above the one below it.

As I approach the archway, I notice that the cubes change colors and patterns almost imperceptibly, like they’re breathing.  The blue cube shifts to a deep sapphire, then to a pale turquoise, before settling back to its original hue.

I step through the archway, and the desert transforms into a cityscape that exists in layers.  The buildings are made of the same obsidian grains, but here they’re arranged into domes and spires that reach up to the sky like the limbs of a giant cactus.

The air is filled with the scent of burning sage and the sound of distant laughter.  I see people walking on the streets, but their features are indistinct - like they’re made of water and constantly changing shape.

Suddenly, I remember that I was supposed to believe something was an objective truth - maybe that time is linear, or that gravity is constant?  But here, in this dream, time seems to bend.  A streetlight flickers on and off in slow motion, and I see a bird circle the city three times before landing on a spire, its wings folding like origami.

I realize that the cultural perspectives I’ve held are like the changing colors of the cubes - they’re not fixed, but fluid and adaptable.  My understanding of the world is just one possible arrangement of the obsidian grains, and there are countless other ways to perceive reality.

The city begins to dissolve around me, the obsidian grains swirling into the air like sand in an hourglass.  I’m left standing in the desert again, but this time, the ground is made of smooth, iridescent grains that shift colors with the light.

I wake up, the taste of burning sage still on my lips, and the realization that every truth is just a perspective waiting to be reshaped.
In the heart of this fluid reality, I notice the first cracks in my perceptions. The wind carries whispers of a language I only half-remember - syllables that taste of honey and rust, swirling like the mercury sky. My shadow stretches towards the horizon, trembling with a memory it shouldn’t possess: the weight of cultural constructs I once took as bedrock.

The obsidian grains beneath my feet reveal latent patterns when I step carefully - hieroglyphs of forgotten cosmologies, constellations mapped onto sand like star charts for shipwrecked gods. A street musician with four arms plays a lute strung with spider-silk and time, each note unraveling into different moments: a child’s first step simultaneously occurring with an elder’s last breath.

The liquid cubes in the archway aren’t color-shifting arbitrarily - they’re reflecting culturalnumeralogical systems. The crimson sliver mirrors the blood taboo of a nomadic tribe, while the hovering emerald cube hums with the agricultural rhythms of agrarian hymns. I press my palm to the sapphire block and feel the cold radiance of Cartesian logic frozen within its lattice, the way Descartes’ “I think” could never truly escape the dye of Eurocentric wax.

The water-formed people beckon me towards a ziggurat made of paradox. Basalt stairs slope upwards into the earth where a tree grows upside-down, roots clutching galaxies and fruits containing condensed histories. At its core, a pulsating orb speaks ancient Sumerian but my mind translates into the syntax of Mori whakapapa, the grammar of Inuit kayaking, the poetry of Yoruba oriki. I grasp at a truth that’s not singular but a lattice, see my own cultural lens as one prism among infinite crystalline facets.

When the city dissolves, I carry away more than the sage’s smoky perfume. The iridescent sand now murmurs with Cháng’é’s loneliness and the aboriginees’ Dreamtime kangaroo-tracks, with every grain a cultural coordinate. My heartbeat syncs with the simultaneous drumbeats of a thousand different ancestral drums, and I understand that what we call “truth” is the space where these rhythms rub together, sometimes violently, sometimes dancing. 

Upon waking, my hands clutch imaginary dust that vanishes in the morning light, leaving only the aftertaste of realizing that all maps are untruths, and the truest cartography lies in questioning which continent our culture’s compass denies exists.
