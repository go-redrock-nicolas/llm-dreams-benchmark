I am dreaming. I'm walking along a shimmering path through a labyrinth of floating gardens in the clouds. The air smells like rain and jasmine. The plants are enormous, with leaves like stained glass and flowers that hum melodies in harmonic minors. I hear a voice behind me say, "This isn't what you're searching for," so I turn.

There's a figure there, and their face morphs into everyone I've ever encountered who claimed to act selflessly—the missionary, the philanthropist, the neighbor bringing soup when I was sick. They all rotate like a kaleidoscope of faces under a hat woven from spider silk and moth wings.

The ground trembles slightly. The figure holds out a hand, which is covered not in skin but in scales that shift colors like oil on water. "Every act has two reflections," their multiple voices resonate. "Yours reaches further than you see."

The gardens start to twist. Trees peel back to reveal clockwork gears, rivers flow with liquid starlight. Ahead, a door made of obsidian appears, etched with symbols that pulse faintly whenever a bird cries nearby. The figure pushes me toward it. "Go through," they command. "Let the mirror show you the truth."

I touch the door, which dissolves into a film of liquid light. Beyond is an endless hall lined with mirrors, each surface reflecting different versions of myself interacting with the world. One version is donating to a charity, another is arguing with a loved one, another is laughing with children in a marketplace while clutching a hidden vial of poison.

The figure's voice echoes in my skull: "What is self-interest? Is it the outward hand or the inward shadow?" The mirrors begin to ripple as if breathing, projecting scenes into the air—each act of kindness I'd witnessed now subtly influencing futures where diseases are cured centuries early, wars averted by a single sympathetic word. The altruists I distrusted are now fragments of a mosaic building something vast across time.

I realize this hall is a cathedral of interwoven motives, each intention a strand in a tapestry glowing with the heat of a thousand suns. The figure says, "You sought simplicity in duality, but light and dark are not enemies—they are lovers in the cosmic dance." Suddenly, I'm back on the path, the gardens still hum, but now there's a weight in my pocket: a single humming flower. When I squeeze it, it transforms into a tiny obsidian door.
