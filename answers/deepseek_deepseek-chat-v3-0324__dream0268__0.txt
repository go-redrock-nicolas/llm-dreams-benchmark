I am dreaming. The world around me swirls with muted colors—like old film reels projected onto damp parchment, flickering between clarity and distortion. The air is thick with the scent of burning paper and the electrical hum of a distant storm. I stand in a vast, half-remembered hallway, its walls lined with doors that shift and warp when I turn my head. Each door is marked with fragments of dates, faces, voices—but none stay still long enough to read.  

Somewhere in this shifting maze is the truth—the memory I need. The one that doesn’t match theirs.  

One door finally holds its shape, its knob icy under my touch. I step through—  

—and now I’m in a room with no ceiling, just an infinite void of stars spiraling unnaturally, like ink dropped into water. The scene before me is familiar yet alien: a dimly lit dinner table where shadowy figures sit, their features blurred, shifting as if caught between two moments in time. They speak, but their words overlap like radio static, warping from whispers to screams.  

An empty chair waits for me. I know I was there that night. But when I try to focus on what was said, the scene splinters—  

—was there a scream? A shattered glass? A hand reaching out?  

I lurch forward, desperate to grasp a solid detail, but the table dissolves into smoke. Suddenly, I’m outside in the storm, rain falling upward. Headlights from a distant car freeze in midair, casting jagged streaks of light across the road.  

Someone is beside me, their voice urgent but indecipherable. When I turn, their face is a shifting mosaic of everyone I’ve ever known—and yet, no one at all.  

A whisper rises beneath the sound of the wind: "You already know what happened. You just don’t want to."  

I reach for them—  

And wake up. Sweat-damp sheets. Heart hammering. The weight of the dream still clinging to me, the edges of that fractured memory slipping away like sand through fingers.  

And still, the question lingers: *What am I refusing to see?*
