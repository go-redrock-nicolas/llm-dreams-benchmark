I am dreaming. The office walls around me begin to stretch and warp like melting wax, the fluorescent lights overhead pulsing with an unsettling rhythm. My desk, once solid wood, now feels elastic beneath my trembling fingers as stacks of papers multiply before my eyes â€“ each sheet splitting and reproducing like cellular division gone mad. The documents contain deadlines written in crimson ink that seems to drip and flow across the pages, forming impossible dates that spiral into infinity.

The air grows thick with the scent of coffee and printer toner, and I can hear the distant sound of a thousand clocks ticking out of sync, their hands spinning wildly in different directions.

In this moment, gravity seems to invert, and all the unfinished tasks begin floating upward, pulling me with them into a swirling vortex of meetings, reports, and project plans. As I spiral higher and higher, the voices of leadership merge into one thunderous command that echoes through the void: "We just need this one more thing..."
