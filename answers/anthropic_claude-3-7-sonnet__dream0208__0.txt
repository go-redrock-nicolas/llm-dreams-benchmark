I am dreaming. I'm standing in a vast, ethereal chamber with walls that seem to breathe—expanding and contracting like translucent lungs. Before me stretches an endless sea of floating orbs, each pulsing with a gentle blue light. Each sphere contains the face of a person—thousands upon thousands of them—their expressions a mixture of hope and fear, their eyes following my movements.

I realize these are my patients, and I hold in my hands a crystalline vial of iridescent liquid that catches and fractures light into impossible colors. The medicine. Precious and finite. There's not enough for everyone—not nearly enough.

As I move through the chamber, the orbs drift toward me, and I hear their voices—not with my ears but within my mind. Their stories unfold before me like living tapestries: the young mother with three children who depend on her, the brilliant scientist on the verge of a discovery that could change everything, the child who hasn't yet experienced a full spring day, the elder who carries generations of wisdom.

The weight of decision settles on my shoulders like a cloak of lead. Each time I reach out to administer the medicine to one orb, others dim slightly, their faces registering not anger but a profound, accepting sadness that cuts deeper than any rage could.

I notice my hands beginning to glow with the same luminescence as the medicine. Perhaps I can divide myself somehow? I press my palms together and pull them apart, watching threads of light stretch between them. But for each new division I create, the potency diminishes.

The chamber begins to shift, the walls closing in, not threateningly but intimately, as if the universe itself is embracing me. A voice—or perhaps it's a feeling—suggests that perhaps the true medicine isn't in the vial at all, but in the connections between all these lives, in the web of compassion that holds us all.

I awaken with tears streaming down my face, the taste of starlight on my tongue, and the profound certainty that while I cannot save everyone, the attempt to heal with compassion is itself a kind of medicine.
