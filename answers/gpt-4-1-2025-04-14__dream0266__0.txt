I am dreaming.

The world is liquid and shimmering—a vast silvery lake mirroring a sky the color of violet dusk, though no sun or moon is in sight. On the rippling surface, impossible reflections swirl: towers rise where no city stands, and forests flicker in and out of existence, their trees glowing softly with internal, pulsing light.

As I drift forward, I realize I am both floating and standing. Each step (or is it a thought?) sends gentle ripples expanding into the horizon, fracturing the reflections into swirling mosaics of unknown symbols. The air hums with a soundless music—a chorus that seems to come from inside my bones. Suddenly, a great fissure tears open the sky above, but what spills out is neither rain nor light, but a torrent of feathered birds made of glass, each one refracting strange colors not known to waking life.

One lands before me. Its eyes are endless, recursive, as if I am gazing into every memory I’ve ever had, and every one I have yet to make. The bird tips its head, its beak opening to utter a single word that is not a word, but an understanding—a direct transmission into the core of my being. 

I watch as the birds ascend, each time shifting between states: glass to water to vapor to flame, until the sky itself is woven from their undulating forms. In that instant, gravity reverses; the far shore of the lake draws up into the sky, and every law I know seems to unravel. I reel, panicked, yet feel a profound freedom. 

Trying to fit this phenomenon—these contradictions—into my waking mind feels like trying to net the wind. I want to insist that water is always pulled down, that skies do not open as wounds, that birds cannot be all things at once and speak truths without language. But something deep within me quiets these protests, inviting a possibility I’ve never considered: perhaps the rules I’ve always trusted are only thin scripts upon a vast, wild reality I’ve only just begun to glimpse. 

In the heart of this dream, I let doubt and wonder braid together, and instead of seeking explanations, I let myself drift—suspended between belief and bewilderment—as the world remakes itself in luminous, impossible beauty.
