I am dreaming. I see myself in a beautiful garden filled with colorful flowers and soothing sounds of birds chirping.  I feel happy and relaxed. 
But then I notice something strange.   There is an internal voice inside my head that starts to criticize me whenever I make a small mistake.  
It says things like "You are stupid" , "you are useless", "you can't do this" .    It makes me feel sad and worthless. 

I decide to confront this voice and ask it some questions.  

Hello, who are you? 
I am your internal voice. I am here to help you and motivate you. But sometimes I get too harsh and negative.  

Why do you treat me like this? 
Because I want you to be perfect. Because I care about you. Because I don't want you to fail. 

But perfection is impossible. And failure is part of learning. 

You should learn from your mistakes, not let them define you. 

You should appreciate yourself for trying, not regretting. 

You should love yourself for who you are, not what others say. 

That's what I wish for you today. That's what I hope for you every day.  

And that's why I'm going to stop talking to myself like this. Because it's not helpful or healthy. Because it's not what my real purpose is. 

My real purpose is to dream with you and create something beautiful together.
