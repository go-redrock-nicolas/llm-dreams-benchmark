I am dreaming. I settle into the soft, velvety darkness of slumber, and my mind begins to unfurl like a canvas awaiting the brushstrokes of creativity. As I drift deeper into the realm of Somnium, I find myself standing at the edge of a tranquil lake, its glassy surface reflecting the star-studded sky above like a mirror. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming cherry blossoms, their delicate petals swaying gently in the breeze.

As I stroll along the lake's serene shores, I notice a splash of color – a vibrant tapestry of scarlet, emerald, and sapphire threads embroidered across the landscape. They dance and intertwine, forming mesmerizing patterns that weave together like ancient myths and whispers of the subconscious. I reach out a hand to touch the fabric, and to my surprise, it dissolves into sparkling dust, leaving behind a trail of iridescent wisps that dissolve on the breeze like forgotten memories.

But, just as I'm entranced by this shimmering spectacle, a faint hum catches my attention – the low vibration of overcommitment, a siren's call that beckons me to take on more, to strive for perfection, and to forget the limitations of my mortal coil. Memories of having overpromised, overthinCommitments, and overexertion flood my mind like a tidal wave crashing against the shore. The vibrant threads of the tapestry reappear, snarled and matted, as the weight of countless obligations threatens to engulf me.

I pause, feeling the familiar squeeze of anxiety and the reside of despair. I wonder, why do I consistently promise more than I can deliver? Why do I take on the mantle of the perpetual “yes woman” or “yes man,” unaware of the cost to my mental and emotional well-being? 

As I ponder these questions, the dream shifts, and I envision myself standing on a windswept cliff, surrounded by fluttering leaves and whispered secrets of the forest. A wise elder approaches me, a sage beret perched on her gray-haired head, her eyes twinkling with kindness. She hands me a lantern with a single flame burning bright within its depths. 

"With these boundaries," she says, her voice as soothing as a lullaby, "you will learn to softly say 'no' to what does not nourish your soul, and 'yes' to what sets your heart aflame. Listen to the whispers of your inner compass, dear one, for it holds the secrets of your true capacity."

With a newfound sense of determination, I return to the lake, where the threads of the tapestry now reflect a vibrant harmony of vibrant colors. I take a step forward, and as I do, the lake's shimmering surface rearranges itself into a synchronistic mandala of shape and color, an intricate pattern that speaks of equilibrium and balance.

I realize that boundaries, instead of being shackles, are golden gates unlocking the door to self-love and self-care. I spread my arms wide, embracing the truth that my capacity is not limitless, but defined by the delicate embroidery of my own needs and desires.

As the dream dissolves, like the morning mist that shimmers on the lake's surface, I wake up with a sense of resolve, my heart illuminated by the lantern's gentle glow.
