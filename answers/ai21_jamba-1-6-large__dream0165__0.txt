I am dreaming. I'm immersed in a society that communicates primarily through elaborate dance rather than words. To express my urgent needs and build connections, I start by moving my body in ways that feel awkward at first. My muscles strain to remember the rhythms I've always felt inside. 

Around me, others glide and spin with a precision that seems like magic. Their movements weave stories and convey emotions so clearly that no one needs to speak. I watch a woman with flowing hair dance to tell a story of betrayal and forgiveness. Her hands trace air spirals, and her feet beat a rhythm into the ground that seems to echo my heartbeat. 

I feel the compulsion to join, but I don't know how. Instead, I stand frozen, my body a tense knot of unspoken words. I try to mimic others' movements, clumsily at first, my limbs flailing in ways that make no sense. I stumble, trying to physically express my confusion. I glance at my dancing companion, hoping for some understanding, but he turns away. 

Frustration wells in me, and suddenly my arms begin to speak for me, slicing through the air in jerky strokes, my legs shaking as they try to keep up. The dance begins to make sense, as if my body is finally speaking a language locked inside. I leap, twirl, stomp, pause. I'm telling a story. 

Another dancer joins me, mirroring my movements perfectly. Their hands reach for mine, and together we create a duet. It feels like breathing, like living. With each step, I feel more connected to the world around me. The dance is not just communication—it’s connection, understanding, and release. 

I wake from the dream feeling lighter, as if I've finally learned how to speak in a way that doesn't rely on words.
