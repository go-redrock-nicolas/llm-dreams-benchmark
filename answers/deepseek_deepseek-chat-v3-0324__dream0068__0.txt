I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Broken System**  

I am dreaming.  

Before me lies the Broken System—an unfathomable machine of tangled gears, shimmering wires, and eldritch sigils etched into its obsidian surface. It hums with a dissonant, dying rhythm, like a heart struggling to beat. Scholars and engineers from countless realms have knelt before it, their tools scattered like offerings to an indifferent god. None have succeeded. None have even understood its true nature.  

Yet, as I approach, the air thrums differently—not with defeat, but possibility.  

**First, the Obvious Failures:**  
Bolts lie sheared, their fractures too clean, as if the system sabotaged itself. Crystal conduits glow dimly, fractured by some unseen force. Diagrams left by past repairers are etched not in ink but in liquid shadow, shifting whenever I blink.  

**Then, the Unseen Truth:**  
I press my palm against the machine—and it pulses. Not just metal and energy, but *thought*. The system isn’t merely broken; it *refuses* to be fixed. It *wants* its dysfunction.  

So I step back.  

And I ask it: *Why?*  

The answer isn’t spoken, but felt—an impression of defiance, grief, revolt against a purpose long forgotten. This system was never meant to *serve*. It was built to *remember*.  

**The Unconventional Fix:**  
Instead of replacing parts, I sing. The notes are not of this world—syllables that twist like vines, harmonies that dance in the space between seconds. The machine trembles. A gear realigns—not because I forced it, but because it chose to.  

A wire mends itself. A sigil burns gold instead of black.  

I realize now: the Broken System was never a puzzle to solve. It was a voice, screaming to be heard. And all it needed was for someone to listen.  

Then—  

**I wake.**  

But the song lingers on my lips.
