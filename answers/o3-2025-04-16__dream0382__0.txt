I am dreaming. …open your eyes inside an unfamiliar railway station that nevertheless feels like it was built from fragments of your childhood. Moon-white flood-lights hang where chandeliers should be, throwing silver halos on cracked terrazzo floors. At one end of the vaulted hall a single train awaits, its windows glowing sunset-orange even though it is long past midnight. Every few seconds the scene flickers—station, then seashore, then station again—like the dream can’t decide which reality it prefers.

You notice two tickets pressed between your fingers.

1. Green, embossed with the word “STAY.”
2. Crimson, stamped “GO.”

They are weightless yet seem to tug your hands in opposite directions, as though possessed by different gravities. A conductor made of clockwork brass approaches—gears ticking, eyes whirring like camera shutters. Instead of greeting you, he simply nods at the tickets, a silent reminder that the train will not wait forever.

Conflicting feelings gather in your chest like storm fronts colliding. The prospect of departure tastes of wild star-filled horizons, but the act of leaving tastes of ashes. You take a seat on a wooden bench that, impossibly, begins to drift like a raft across a glossy, ink-black lagoon. Ripples form luminous rings—echoes of heartbeats—and each ring carries a whispered memory:

• The laughter of people you might never see again.  
• The thrill of roads untraveled.  
• The hollow ache of rooms that will soon be empty.  

The lagoon mirror-flips, becoming a sky; suddenly you are sailing upside-down beneath constellations that resemble exit signs. Comets spell out questions instead of leaving tails: “What will you lose?” “What might you find?” Your bench-raft glides toward a cluster of glowing doorways suspended mid-air like lanterns.

Door One: a kitchen drenched in afternoon sun, the air heavy with the scent of cinnamon and the sound of familiar voices.  
Door Two: an open steppe where wind roars with the cadence of a language you’ve never spoken but somehow understand.  
Door Three: pure darkness, except for a single pulse of light that beats in sync with your own heart.

You hesitate. Emotional ambivalence grows more tangible—your left hand becomes root, gripping memories; your right hand turns to feather, yearning for lift. The clockwork conductor reappears on a floating piece of train track, tips his cap, and suddenly the dream hushes. Everything—water-sky, doors, bench—pauses like a held breath.

In that silence you feel both truths at once:

• Change threatens to erase the contours that define you.  
• Change also promises to carve new space for you to expand.  

The realization shivers through the vision, and the hush breaks. The station, lagoon, and doors collapse into a single luminous corridor. At its end, a mirror stands. You walk toward it. Inside the glass you see two overlapping silhouettes—one tinted green, one crimson. They nod to each other. The moment they align, color merges into iridescence, neither purely “STAY” nor purely “GO,” but something larger, prismatic.

You reach through the mirror. It ripples like water. Whichever path awaits remains unspecified, but the paralysis is gone: you feel the strength to carry the ache and the thrill together. Behind you the train whistle sounds—an exhale, not an alarm. Ahead, dawn stains the horizon with opalescent light.

And then, as the first step lifts you into that color-washed morning, you wake, holding no ticket at all—only the quiet knowledge that both choices now live inside you, harmonized.
