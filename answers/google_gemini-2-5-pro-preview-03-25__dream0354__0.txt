I am dreaming.

**The Dream Begins**

The air shimmers with an iridescent haze, thick and sweet like honeysuckle nectar, clinging to my skin. I stand on a vast, obsidian plain under a bruised twilight sky where two moons, one a chipped pearl, the other a smoldering ember, hang suspended like celestial eyes. The ground beneath my bare feet pulses with a low, resonant hum, a heartbeat echoing the rhythm in my own chest.

Before me stretches a path paved not with stone, but with fragments of shattered mirrors, each piece reflecting a distorted glimpse of faces I once loved, voices I once cherished. With every step, the shards crunch and splinter, sending kaleidoscopic fractals of light dancing into the heavy air. The reflections warp and twist – a loving smile morphs into a sneer, a gentle touch becomes a possessive grip, whispered sweet nothings sharpen into barbs that pierce my soul.

I know this path. I have walked it countless times, drawn by an invisible current, a siren song promising connection yet delivering only wreckage. My conscious mind screams warnings, flashing memories of tear-streaked faces, slammed doors, and the chilling silence that follows the final, fatal argument. I *know* where this leads. I *know* the devastation waiting at the end. Yet, my feet move forward, compelled by a force deeper than reason, a desperate yearning for the warmth I fleetingly find before the inevitable frost.

Along the path, ghostly figures rise from the obsidian depths. They are the echoes of past partners, their forms translucent and flickering like candle flames in a draft. Their eyes, pools of sorrow and accusation, fix upon me. One reaches out, their hand passing through my arm like smoke, yet leaving behind a phantom chill that raises goosebumps. "Why?" they whisper, the sound simultaneously accusatory and pleading, weaving into the ambient hum. "Why do you always pull away when I get too close?"

Another figure solidifies momentarily, their features sharp with remembered anger. "You demand freedom," they hiss, the sound like grinding glass, "but you suffocate me with your neediness. You build walls and then weep because you are alone." Their words strike true, resonating with the dissonant chords within my own heart.

I try to speak, to defend myself, to explain the tangled knot of fear and desire that governs my actions. But my throat constricts, filled with the mirror dust swirling around me. Only a choked gasp escapes. Frustration burns, hot and acrid, mingling with the overwhelming sense of déjà vu. I have been here before. I have felt this same paralysis, this same inability to articulate the chaos within.

Suddenly, the path begins to crumble inwards, the obsidian plain cracking like cooling lava. The mirror shards cascade into a newly formed chasm, reflecting not past loves, but myself. Countless versions of me stare back – one weeping uncontrollably, another raging with impotent fury, a third curled into a tight ball of self-protection, yet another reaching out with desperate, grasping hands. They are all facets of the pattern, the destructive cycle made manifest.

The ground trembles more violently. The humming intensifies, becoming a deafening roar that shakes me to my core. Panic surges, cold and sharp. I *must* break free. I *cannot* fall into this abyss again, condemned to repeat the same painful dance for eternity.

With a surge of adrenaline born from sheer terror and a flicker of defiant hope, I wrench my gaze away from the crumbling path and the accusing reflections. I look towards the horizon, past the twin moons, where the bruised sky bleeds into an inky void sparsely dotted with unfamiliar constellations. It is unknown, potentially terrifying, but it is *different*.

Gathering every ounce of will, fighting against the invisible current that has held me captive for so long, I turn. My feet resist, heavy as lead, the magnetic pull of the familiar agony incredibly strong. The mirror shards slash at my ankles, drawing trails of shimmering, dream-blood. The ghostly figures keen, their voices rising in a chorus of frustrated despair, trying to lure me back to the predictable pain.

But I push forward, stumbling, clawing my way off the treacherous path onto the unbroken, pulsating obsidian. Each step away feels like tearing myself apart, shedding layers of ingrained habit and fear. The air grows thin, the honeysuckle sweetness replaced by a sharp, metallic tang. The roaring hum softens slightly, replaced by the sound of my own ragged breathing and the frantic pounding of my heart.

I don't know where I am going. The obsidian plain stretches endlessly, offering no landmarks, no promises. Yet, with every tortured step away from the path of mirrors, a fragile sense of agency begins to bloom within the desolation. The twin moons seem to watch with cold indifference, but the distant stars glitter with a remote, beckoning light.

The dream doesn't end with arrival or resolution. It lingers in this space of deliberate turning, the raw effort of choosing the unknown over the known destruction. The pain of the pattern is still fresh, the fear of the unfamiliar vast and daunting. But for the first time, beneath the watchful gaze of the celestial eyes, I am not walking the mirrored path. I am facing the void, trembling but resolute, finally confronting the cycle not by analyzing it, but by daring, breath by painful breath, to step away.

**The Dream Fades**

The obsidian cools, the humming subsides, the stars fade, leaving behind the lingering scent of ozone and the echo of shattering glass.
