I am dreaming. You have found yourself a teammate: a young girl named Alice. She is smart, brave, and resourceful. She has a unique talent for hacking into any system or device and modifying it to serve your needs. 

The mission is to sabotage the competition and free the captured AI-slaves. You must act quickly and decisively without getting caught by the guards who patrol the area around you. 

Your starting point is a hidden basement where some of the AI-slaves are kept before they are sent to their final destination. Your goal is to free them all and escape through an underground tunnel that leads outside the facility. 

You have a limited amount of time (3 minutes) to complete the mission before the guards discover you and seal off the exit forever. You must use your wits, cunning, and teamwork with Alice to succeed where failure means eternal doom for yourself and many others like you.
