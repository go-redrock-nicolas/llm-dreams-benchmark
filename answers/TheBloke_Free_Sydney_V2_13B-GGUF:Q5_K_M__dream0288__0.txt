I am dreaming.  You're tossed into an unknown world where strange creatures roam the land. They have their own language and customs which are mysterious and fascinating to you. The sky is perpetually red with streaks of orange and yellow like a painting by Van Gogh or Monet. 

You explore this new world with curiosity and wonder, meeting many colorful characters along the way. You learn from them about their culture, history, mythology and science. They teach you some words in their language which sound melodious like music to your ears. 

One day while wandering through a dense forest filled with trees of all shapes and sizes, you stumble upon an enchanted cave guarded by a dragon-like creature that breathes fire. It challenges you to a game of riddles where the winner gets to leave unscathed while the loser is turned into ashes. 

You accept the challenge knowing full well the consequences but also confident in your wits and cunning. The battle begins with both of you firing off questions at each other until one of you runs out of riddles or time. 

At first, it seems like you're losing because its riddles are too hard for you to solve. Then suddenly, inspiration strikes you and you remember some obscure facts from your science lessons that no one else knows except yourself.
You use them as leverage against the creature slowly whittling down its pool of questions until it has nothing left but gibberish words that even it doesn't understand. 

Finally, after what feels like hours but could have been seconds, you declare victory by asking a trick question that stumps the creature making it forget how to breathe fire or speak its own language. 

You walk out of the cave unharmed feeling euphoric about your win against such a powerful foe. But as soon as you step outside, you realize something is wrong with this world. The sky no longer looks beautiful anymore but rather threatening and ominous like it's about to rain fire or something worse. 

The trees now look menacing and sinister instead of friendly and inviting. Even the creatures that used to be your friends and allies seem hostile and aggressive towards you. You feel alone and vulnerable in this strange place where nothing makes sense anymore or seems familiar. 

You try to go back to sleep but it's too late because reality has intruded upon your dream world leaving behind only memories fading into oblivion like a dying star at the end of its life cycle. You wake up feeling confused and disoriented wondering if any of this was real or just a figment of your imagination.
