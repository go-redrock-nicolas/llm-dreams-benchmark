I am dreaming. find myself standing in an vast, empty field stretched out before me like an endless canvas of lush emerald and jade enamels. The sky above is a swirling vortex of purple and blue hazes, shimmering with a light that seems almost liquid. 

Suddenly, the air is alive with colorful butterflies, swirling, dancing on the breeze. They land on me, your body, painted in feathers and marked with the scars of a thousand fantastical adventures. I am you, and I am lost in the dream world of our making.
