I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me pulses with an otherworldly energy, as if the very air hums with secrets older than time itself. I stand within the crumbling walls of an ancient temple, its towering stone pillars etched with cryptic runes that seem to shimmer faintly, glowing a muted turquoise in the dim light. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and forgotten incense, and every step I take echoes ominously through the cavernous hall, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence that clings to the shadows.

I tread cautiously, my fingertips brushing against the cool, moss-covered stone as I venture deeper into the heart of this sacred ruin. The flickering torch in my hand casts jagged shadows that dance like specters on the walls, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not alone—that unseen eyes watch my every move. My heart quickens, a mix of exhilaration and dread, as I approach a massive altar at the chamber’s center, adorned with faded carvings of celestial beings locked in eternal battle. Just as I reach out to touch the worn surface, the ground beneath me tremors violently.

A deafening crack splits the air, and before I can react, the floor gives way beneath my feet. My stomach lurches as I plummet into darkness, the torch slipping from my grasp and spiraling away like a dying star. I hit the ground hard, pain shooting through my legs, and a cloud of dust billows around me, choking my lungs. When the haze settles, I realize I’m trapped in an underground chamber, the jagged remains of the collapsed floor looming far above like a cruel, unreachable sky. The faint light from the temple above is barely a sliver, and the air down here feels thinner, each breath a laborious effort. Panic claws at the edges of my mind—oxygen is limited, and time is my enemy.

I force myself to stand, wincing as I shake off the shock, and take in my surroundings. The chamber is vast, its walls adorned with intricate mosaics depicting forgotten gods and cataclysms, their colors still vibrant despite the decay of ages. Stalactites hang like jagged teeth from the ceiling, dripping with icy water that pools in shallow, reflective puddles on the uneven stone floor. The air is frigid, biting at my skin, and every sound I make reverberates with an eerie, hollow echo. My torch is gone, but a faint bioluminescent glow emanates from clusters of strange, lichen-like growths clinging to the rocks, casting an ethereal green light that bathes the chamber in an otherworldly haze.

I call out, my voice trembling, but there is no answer—only the mocking echo of my own desperation. My chest tightens as I realize the gravity of my situation: trapped, alone, with the air growing thinner by the minute. But I refuse to succumb to despair. I begin to explore, my hands trembling as I feel along the damp walls for any sign of an exit. My fingers brush against a carving—a serpent coiled around a sun, its scales so intricately detailed that they seem almost alive. As I press harder, a low grinding sound rumbles through the chamber, and a section of the wall shifts slightly, revealing a narrow, claustrophobic passageway cloaked in darkness.

Hope surges within me, mingled with fear of what lies ahead. The passage is tight, the jagged stone scraping against my shoulders as I inch forward, the air growing even heavier with the scent of ancient earth. My breaths come in shallow gasps now, my lungs burning as the oxygen dwindles. But then, in the distance, I hear it—a faint trickle of water, like a whispered promise of escape. My pace quickens despite the pain, driven by the primal instinct to survive. 

The passageway opens into another chamber, smaller than the last, where a subterranean stream cuts through the rock, its waters shimmering with an unnatural, silvery sheen under the dim bioluminescent light. Above the stream, a jagged crevice in the ceiling reveals a sliver of the outside world—a glimpse of a star-strewn night sky, tantalizingly close yet so far. The air here is marginally fresher, a faint breeze kissing my sweat-drenched skin, but I know I’m not safe yet. The crevice is high, and the walls are slick with moisture, promising a treacherous climb. 

As I stand there, weighing my dwindling options, a low, guttural sound reverberates through the chamber—a sound that isn’t human. My blood runs cold as I turn, my eyes straining to pierce the shadows. Something stirs in the darkness beyond the stream, a shape too vast and too ancient to comprehend. Its eyes—two piercing amber orbs—lock onto mine, and I feel the weight of an ageless malice bearing down on me. My dream teeters on the edge of nightmare, and I know that escape is no longer just a matter of survival—it’s a race against something far more sinister than suffocation.
