I am dreaming. Nightmares begin as whispers in the back of your mind, sneaking into the forefront as you lay awake in the darkness. Tonight, you are engulfed in a world unbound by logic and drenched in the essence of your subconscious fears. 

You stand at the edge of an ancient forest, where the trees rise like skeletal fingers against a pale, moonlit sky. The air is thick and cold, carrying the faint scent of decaying leaves and wet earth. You hear the tinkle of water nearby, like a stream burbling over moss-covered stones, yet you cannot see its source. 

As you venture deeper, the trees seem to close in around you, their gnarled branches reaching out as if to grasp at your very soul. The ground beneath your feet is soft, sinking with every step, and you wonder if the earth might swallow you whole. 

You feel it before you see it: a presence lurking in the shadows. A low growl reverberates through the still air, and your heart quickens, pounding against your chest like the frantic wings of a caged bird. You turn slowly, dread pooling in your stomach, and there, in a clearing bathed in eerie blue light, it stands. 

A creature of nightmares — half wolf, half something indescribable — its eyes glow like molten gold, piercing through the darkness. Its fur shimmers, not with the softness of life but with the metallic sheen of machinery, as if it were crafted from the remnants of a world long gone. Its jaws gape open, revealing teeth that glisten like shards of broken glass. 

“You should have done it when you had the chance,” the creature says, its voice a low rasp that cuts through your very being. The words hang in the air, heavy with accusation. 

You want to run, but your legs are rooted to the spot, as if the earth itself has claimed you. The creature steps closer, its claws clicking against the forest floor. The smell of burning ash fills your nostrils. 

“This is the end,” it growls. 

And then, the dream shifts. 

You are no longer in the forest. Instead, you are in a cavernous hall, its ceilings lost in shadows. The walls pulse and ripple like living flesh. A cacophony of voices surrounds you, whispering secrets you can almost understand, but not quite. 

A figure materializes before you — a specter cloaked in rags, its face a visage of sorrow and decay. “Time,” it croaks. “Time is the predator that stalks us all.” 

Behind the specter, you see images flickering like broken film: moments of your life, fragmented and incomplete. Regret washes over you, so potent it feels like drowning. 

The dream fades, leaving only the echo of those whispered words, and the unsettling feeling that some paths, once taken, cannot be undone. 

You wake with a start, your heart racing, the chill of the night air pressing against your skin. The nightmare lingers like a shadow, a reminder of what happens when you let fear and procrastination take hold. 

For now, the dream is over. But you know it will return, like the turning of a page in a story far from over.
