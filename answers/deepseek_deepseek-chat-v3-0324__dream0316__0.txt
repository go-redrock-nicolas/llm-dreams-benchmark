I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Faded Brand**  

The air smells faintly of ink and paper—an old, comforting scent—but there’s something acrid beneath it now, like plastic left too long in the sun. I stand in a vast, dimly lit warehouse that stretches into impossible distances, its ceiling lost in shadow. Towering shelves loom around me, stacked high with familiar products: the logo I’ve loved for years stamped onto every box, every label, but everything feels… *wrong.*  

The packaging is sleeker, ultra-modern, all sharp edges and cold metallic finishes. It glints under the sterile glow of buzzing fluorescent lights. I pick up a box—something I’ve bought a hundred times before—but the weight feels off. Too light. When I shake it, something rattles inside, loose and unsteady. I tear it open, and to my dismay, the contents are shrunken, hollow, like a husk of what they once were. The craftsmanship is gone, replaced by something thin and brittle, a rushed imitation.  

A voice echoes through the warehouse, smooth and computerized: *"New and improved. Premium quality. Elevated experience."* The words repeat like a broken record, growing louder, more insistent, until the shelves themselves seem to whisper them.  

Then, the walls begin to move. The shelves shift, rearrange, closing in like a maze, forcing me toward a brightly lit display at the center. There, glowing as if under a spotlight, are competitor brands—products I’ve always dismissed but now find myself examining with reluctant curiosity. They feel better somehow. Sturdier. More *real.*  

A deep, melancholic ache settles in my chest. Loyalty wars with practicality. *This isn’t the brand I fell in love with,* I think. *It’s wearing its name like a stolen skin.*  

And then—I wake.  

The scent of plastic lingers. My hand is clenched as if still holding that empty box.
