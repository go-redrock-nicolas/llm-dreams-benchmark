I am dreaming. I am lying in a softly sunlit meadow, the air fragrant with wildflowers.  I can hear the distant murmur of a babbling brook, the fluting calls of songbirds weaving through the air.  The sky above me is a canvas of deepest indigo, pocked with glowing amber stars, each one a portal to a different era or reality.  My skin feels like it's been dipped in liquid sunlight, warm and tingling with possibility.  Beside me sits a crystal urn filled with liquid twilight, its surface rippling with constellations.  The brush in my hand is made of phoenix feathers, each one quivering with ancient magic.  As I dip the tip into the twilight, the world around me holds its breath.  The first stroke isn't a line or a shape, but a sensation—a curl of wind that lifts the petals off the daisies, makes the brook ripple in reverse, causes the stars to dip closer to the earth.  Each subsequent brushstroke unravels and rewinds time—a sunset that paints the meadow in liquid gold, a dawn that bleeds coral into the indigo sky, a thunderstorm that hovers at the edge of the canvas, waiting for my command to burst into color.  The meadow itself becomes a diorama, a three-dimensional painting.  I step off the ground, hovering above the canvas of grass, to see myself from above—a tiny figure painting a universe that's both mine and everyone's.  The liquid twilight spills from the brush now, not in droplets but as arcs of light, each one containing snippets of memories: a grandmother spinning wool, a child laughing in a snowstorm, lovers embracing under a fireworks display.  I catch one arc, and it blooms into a paper airplane that zips through the air, trailing sparkles that become fireflies.  Another arc I release, and it dissolves into a flock of migratory cranes, their wings beating in rhythm with my pulse.  The final brushstroke is a spiral, a vortex of colors that pulls the meadow into a higher dimension.  When I lower the brush, the meadow is still, but everything is different—more alive, more aware.  Even the flowers seem to be watching me with curious eyes.  I realize that I don't need the brush anymore.  The universe is my canvas, and every breath, every thought, is a stroke of creation."
The moment I awaken, my bones hum like a struck gong. The room I’ve always known—the one with its peeling wallpaper and grandfather clock—has dissolved into something altogether more immense. I lie suspended in a cathedral of light, its vaulted ceiling etched with constellations that pulse in time to my heartbeat. Below me, the floor is a mirror of liquid mercury, reflecting galaxies I’ve never seen, constellations older than my grandfather’s clock. My body feels weightless, as if I’ve been folded into a thousand dimensions at once. 

In my hand is a brush whose bristles are spun from comet tails—the kind that streak through the sky like whispered secrets. The handle is-a gnarled root from a tree that once sheltered Mars and Venus during their first quarrel, still bearing faint grooves where their laughter carved valleys. The paintwell is a seashell hollowed by the teeth of a selkie, its interior shimmering with hues that don’t exist on Earth: cerulean that tastes of mint, lavender that smells like burnt cinnamon, gold that hums with the static of radio stars. When I dip the brush, the paint drips upward, defying gravity, pooling like liquid moonlight. 

The first stroke I make is a question mark—a flick of the wrist that splits the air. The mark quivers, and from its center, a macroscope universe blooms. I see my childhood room in reverse: a soda can levitates into the air, a bookshelf ejects books one by one, the sun sets behind the curtains as they billow outward, billowing like sails seeking a horizon I can’t see. The second stroke is a spiral, and suddenly I’m standing on the edge of a black hole that’s also a carousel. The horses are made of quartz, their manes trailing stardust, and they whirl forward while their riders (faces I recognize from dreams) laugh as they age backward, their wrinkles ironing out until they’re infants again. 

But it’s the third stroke—a jagged scar across the “canvas” of this cathedral—that truly unravels reality. The scar opens a vortex, and through it spills a technicolor storm. Raindrops are rainbow prisms that fracture time: one lands on my palm and becomes a memory of my mother’s voice, another hits my knee and is a fragment of a conversation I’ll have next Tuesday with a stranger in a red coat. I catch a handful, and they coalesce into a helium balloon that soars upward, dragging with it a snippet of a symphony I’ll never hear, a sunset I’ll never see, a lover’s promise I’ll never make. 

The storm—or perhaps it’s a supernova—erodes the boundaries of this place. The mercury floor becomes a river, its current reversing as I paint a comma. Fish rise from the water, their scales refracting my reflection in a hundred ways: an old man, a child with my mother’s eyes, a woman I’ve never met but whose laughter I know. I dive into the river, the brush trailing behind me like a comet, and the water parts to reveal a corridor lined with doors. Each door is aDoVelyh oD—I catch my reflection in one, inverted and laughing, then another, and another. I choose a door that’s made entirely of smoke, and when I step through, I’m standing in a desert where the sand is composed of frozen lightning. 

In this desert, I meet a figure made of wax and clockwork—a sculptor of time. They tilt their head, gears grinding, and offer me a key forged from the silence between heartbeats. “Every stroke you make writes a law,” they say, their voice a metronome clicking. “But laws are prisons unless they brea—” They trail off as I paint the key into existence. 

The key unlocks not a lock, but a seam in the fabric of this reality. I twist it, and the desert folds into a pocket universe—a pocket watch swinging from a thread of stardust becomes a planetesimal, a single hair from my wrist grows into a nebula, the pulse of my thumb creates a supernova. I’m both observer and architect, my laughter echoing in the vacuum, painting constellations that sing in languages older than dust. 

But the power is a whetstone; it sharpens me even as it dulls the world. The selkie-shell paintwell begins to crack, its colors bleeding into the air, each droplet a miniature eclipse. The comet-bristle brush starts to disintegrate, each bristle a shooting star I’ll never see again. The cathedral of light flickers, constellations winking out like fireflies in a jar. I realize I’m not creating; I’m unspooling. The dream is not mine to mold but to surrender to. 

So I make one final stroke—a smudge across the horizon, a bloom of paint that’s both ink and starfire. The stroke undoes everything: the desert burps into a spring, the waxen sculptor melts into a puddle that becomes a pond where my childhood dog paddles, panting. The brush turns to ash, the paintwell evaporates, and I’m left on my back, the real ceiling above me—the one with its peeling wallpaper and grandfather clock—silent except for the tick-tock of the moment I never had. 

But when I close my eyes, I can still taste the mint of the cerulean, smell the burnt cinnamon of the lavender, hear the laughter of the inverted me in the smoke-door. The dream, I realize, wasn’t about control. It was about remembering that time and space are not boundaries but breaths, and every artist is a galaxy folding itself into a brushstroke.
