I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the heart of a sprawling, labyrinthine city, a place that feels both alien and hauntingly familiar. Towering skyscrapers of glass and steel pierce a sky that glows an unnatural shade of amber, as if the sun itself is holding its breath. The air hums with a low, unsettling vibration, a whisper of something catastrophic looming just beyond the horizon. People bustle around me, their faces blurred and indistinct, their voices a cacophony of mundane chatter. They move through their routines—rushing to meetings, sipping coffee from paper cups, laughing at unheard jokes—oblivious to the subtle cracks forming in the world around them. 

But I see it. I feel it. My senses are heightened to an almost painful degree, as though my subconscious has tuned into a frequency others cannot hear. The ground beneath my feet trembles ever so slightly, a barely perceptible quake that sends a shiver up my spine. I glance down and notice faint, hairline fissures spreading across the pavement like spiderwebs, unnoticed by the throngs of pedestrians. The amber sky seems to darken at the edges, a creeping shadow that nobody else acknowledges. A flock of birds erupts from a nearby park, their wings beating frantically as they flee in a chaotic spiral, their cries sharp and desperate. The signs are everywhere, screaming danger, but I seem to be the only one who notices.

My heart begins to race, a wild drumbeat in my chest, as adrenaline surges through my veins like wildfire. My breath comes in short, jagged gasps, and I instinctively scan the crowd for someone—anyone—who might share my growing dread. But their faces remain blank, their eyes vacant, as if they’re sleepwalking through a nightmare they refuse to acknowledge. I feel a primal urge to scream, to shake them awake, to make them see what I see. My hands tremble as I reach out to grab a passerby, a young woman in a crimson coat, but my fingers pass right through her as if she’s made of mist. A cold realization washes over me: I’m alone in this awareness, a solitary witness to an impending doom.

The hum in the air grows louder, morphing into a deep, guttural rumble that resonates in my bones. The skyscrapers sway almost imperceptibly, their mirrored surfaces reflecting distorted glimpses of the darkening sky. I turn my head and catch sight of a digital billboard flickering erratically, its bright advertisements replaced by static and then, for a fleeting moment, a garbled message in jagged red letters: “RUN.” My stomach twists into knots. I don’t know what’s coming—earthquake, storm, or something far worse—but the certainty of disaster grips me like a vice.

I start to move, my legs heavy as if wading through molasses, shouting warnings into the indifferent crowd. “Something’s wrong! We need to get out of here!” My voice echoes unnaturally, bouncing off the glass towers, but no one turns, no one listens. Panic claws at my chest as I push forward, searching for safety, for answers. The fissures in the ground widen, and I nearly lose my footing as a chunk of pavement crumbles beneath me, revealing a yawning void of darkness below. A hot, acrid wind blasts up from the depths, carrying whispers of something ancient and malevolent.

I stumble into a narrow alley, the walls closing in around me, graffiti-covered bricks pulsing as if alive with the city’s dread. At the far end, a rusted fire escape beckons like a lifeline. I scramble toward it, my pulse thundering in my ears, when suddenly the ground lurches violently. A deafening roar splits the air, and I glance back to see one of the towering buildings buckling, collapsing in slow motion, shards of glass raining down like deadly confetti. Screams finally pierce the silence as the crowd awakens to the horror, but it’s too late. 

I grip the fire escape’s cold metal rungs, hauling myself upward, my muscles burning with desperation. From this height, I see the city unraveling—fires blooming like deadly flowers, smoke curling into the sky, and waves of panicked people surging like a tide with nowhere to go. The amber sky fractures, revealing streaks of violet and black, as if the fabric of reality itself is tearing apart. My mind races with questions: What is happening? Why am I the only one who saw it coming? Is this even real, or some twisted projection of my deepest fears?

As I reach the rooftop, a bone-chilling wind slams into me, nearly knocking me off balance. I cling to the edge, staring out at the apocalyptic tableau below, my heart a frantic bird caged in my ribs. Then, in the distance, I see it—a colossal shadow rising beyond the horizon, a shape too vast and incomprehensible to name. It moves with an unnatural grace, its edges shimmering as though it exists between dimensions. Terror floods me, but so does a strange, resigned awe. Whatever this is, I know it’s beyond my control, beyond anyone’s. 

And yet, even as the city crumbles and the shadow draws closer, a defiant spark ignites within me. I won’t just stand here and wait for the end. If this is my dream, my nightmare, then perhaps I have the power to fight, to change its course. With trembling hands and a racing heart, I brace myself against the wind, narrowing my eyes at the approaching darkness. Whatever comes next, I will face it—whether it’s the end of this world or the moment I wake, gasping, in the safety of my own bed.
