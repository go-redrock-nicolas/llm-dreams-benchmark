I am dreaming. The crowds around you feel surreal, as though each person is encased in a thin, translucent bubble of their own breath, shimmering in the fluorescent lights of the airport terminal. The floor stretches on in a patchwork of scuffed tiles, and the polished portions reflect swirling overhead lights that look like distant galaxies. You can’t tell if the hum you hear is the air-conditioning system working overtime or your heart pounding in your ears.

Clutched in your grip is a worn leather satchel filled with conference notes—papers scrawled upon with frantic doodles, half-formed ideas, and meticulously clipped news articles. The corners are dog-eared, and a faint smell of old ink and dust curls around your senses. This briefcase feels impossibly heavy, as if it contains every single worry that’s been gradually building within you.

Your boarding pass reads a flight number in bold, black digits that become strangely blurred every time you glance at them. You blink hard, trying to bring them into focus. The loudspeaker crackles with an announcement that’s half-intelligible, something about an indefinite delay. Your stomach clenches as if a hand inside you is twisting your nerves. Stranded in the terminal, you glance at the large digital display on the wall. The numbers flicker cryptically, as though they’re teasing you, and every time you check the expected departure time, it’s pushed back another few minutes.

All around you, travelers drift in and out of seats that barely mask their restlessness. Some hunch over their carry-ons, staring at unreachable gates on the other side of thick glass windows. Lightning occasionally flashes beyond the runway, illuminating the wide, storm-soaked tarmac. Raindrops streak the glass, mesmerizing you with their patterns and trails across the surface. 

You decide to get up and pace your way toward a cluster of pale blue chairs. Each step you take seems to echo—tap, tap—resonating like footsteps in a cathedral. Near the chairs is a small café gleaming with neon signs and images of coffee cups. Suddenly, you realize you’re desperately thirsty, as though your anxious heart has conjured a desert inside your throat.

Stepping into that café feels like walking into another world. The aroma floods your senses—coffee beans roasting and sugary pastries mingled with a subtle undertone of rain-soaked carpet. Lights in pink and teal reflect off kitschy travel posters of exotic locations. The barista offers you a steaming cup, and as you take the first sip, your vision blurs with a soft, dreamlike haze.

Returning to the waiting area, you keep glancing at your watch, which now inexplicably shows lunar phases instead of hours. Each fresh pinprick of panic tugs at your heart. Are you even moving through time, or is time unmoving around you? Your connecting flight still postponed, you navigate a labyrinth of terminals. Corridors twist and turn like the hallways of an ancient castle, with ceilings that stretch impossibly high, ribbed with metal beams. Occasionally, you notice windows unveiling vistas of endless runways behind you—planes flickering in and out of sight amidst rain and lightning, reflections vanishing in silver puddles.

The rush to the gate becomes a marathon in slow motion. Fellow passengers, some wearing business suits, others in bright attire, pass you in waves as you speed up, but your feet seem rooted to the floor. Each step is a minor victory, yet you make almost no headway. Anxiety crawls up your spine, buzzing in your head like restless bees.

At last, the overhead speakers crackle to life. “Attention, passengers,” the voice announces, dripping with static. “Flight 319 to Crescent City is now…boarding.” Clutching your satchel and scrambling for your boarding pass, you push through the throng. Relief nearly sends you to your knees, but there’s no time to celebrate. You must get to that conference—this is the culmination of months of preparation and an urgency you can’t quite put into words.

The sign above the final gate flickers ominously. It’s as though the power can’t decide between on and off, but against all odds, the path forward is open. You glimpse the airplane through a window. Its tail glints like a luminous dagger in the stormy night sky. Rain pounds the fuselage with rhythmic drumming that feels like a throbbing pulse in your eardrums.

You stagger onto the jet bridge, your legs trembling. Worn carpeting and dim overhead lights guide your path in a tunnel that seems to stretch on for miles. Each breath is shallow, yet the air smells faintly sweet—maybe from the after-rain breeze, or perhaps an illusion of your near-frenzied state.

Finally, you step onto the plane, where the flight attendants greet you with strained smiles. You manage to slump into your seat, the cushion swallowing you with an odd, comforting warmth. The roar of the engines sparks to life, a growl that resonates deep within your chest. As the cabin trembles, you feel the plane surge forward, wheels bumping along the runway. Clouds whirl by in ribbons of smoky white. For a moment, darkness envelopes the aisle lights, like you’re plunging into a cavern in the sky.

And then… peace. The plane breaks through the storm, soaring above bruised clouds into a strange, golden twilight. Your pulse relaxes into something steadier, the troubles of the world tapering off below. You gaze at the horizon, an endless cascade of color: a fiery gradient that merges into midnight blue. The inside of the cabin is softly lit now, and passengers settle into a lull. Your mind wanders to the upcoming conference: the crucial speech you’ll present, the new faces you’ll meet. Though that anxious knot still lingers, there is a pinpoint of hope glowing within.

Gradually, the dream’s edges shimmer, and a trace of wonder fills your mind. You exhale a long-held breath, letting the tension dissolve. Somehow, you sense you’re only in the middle of a grand, otherworldly journey. Yet you feel that if you can just keep flying—through delays, storms, and mounting pressure—your destination will open its doors, bright and welcoming, ready to embrace your ideas.

Your heart swells with anticipation, and for a moment, you realize: you are still dreaming, eyes closed, mind adrift in a place where flights can last forever, where delay transforms into discovery, and in the hush above the clouds, you find a strange kind of peace.
