I am dreaming. I stand in a dimly lit chamber, surrounded by the oppressive weight of centuries of tradition. The wooden dais before me stretches like an anvil, its surface scratched by countless deliberations past. In front, the accused sits shackled, their gaunt face cast in flickering candlelight. The crowd presses forward, a mass of eager eyes and hushed whispers. Political heavyweights linger at the edges, their presence felt more than seen. Each day brings whispered threats and mysterious gifts, testing my conviction with promises of power or warnings of peril. I steel my resolve, letting the evidence guide my judgment despite the suffocating atmosphere of pressure and fear.
