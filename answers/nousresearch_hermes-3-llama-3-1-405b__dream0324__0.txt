I am dreaming. In my dream, I awake in a child's body. The nightmare's dark tendrils have followed me into the waking world, a world I now recognize as ancient Mesopotamia. Looking around, I find myself surrounded by towering ziggurats draped in vibrant red fabrics, their peaks stretching into the clouds. My feet sink slightly into the warm, damp earth beneath me. As merchants and travelers brush past me hurrying down the bustling noisy streets, I catch fragments of unknown dialects and staccato bits of conversation. The air is scented with an intoxicating blend of incense and spices that both tickles and burns my nostrils.

Shaking off my unease, I wander closer to the hubbub of the market, attempting to lose my lingering fears in the crowded tapestry of humanity. I am fascinated by the brightly-colored robes, the people with skin tones ranging from the palest ivory to the richest ebony, their animated faces filled with laughter, fierce bartering and the occasional flash of anger.

My bare feet, still unaccustomed to the moist earth, slip on the mud-slicked path that circles the Great Ziggurat. As if sensing my vulnerability, a gnarled old beggar woman, the brown skin of her hands covered with a multitude of intricately-inked symbols, reaches out and offers to tell my fortune. Her deep-set obsidian eyes, glowing with an otherworldly light, bore into me, and despite my desperate wish for anonymity, I feel compelled to accept her offer.

I kneel on the itchy, straw-covered ground before her as she begins to mutter under her breath. Around us, the crowd stills, as if frozen in time. The crone's murmurs grow in volume and intensity, indecipherable strings of rhythmic syllables that seem to vibrate through my mind. I feel as if this ancient chant is reaching into the very depths of my soul, excavating my most secret terrors and repressed memories. The cadence of her words meshes with the racing thud of my pulse, simultaneously lulling me into a trance and filling me with a growing sense of dread.

At last, the old woman completes her incantation, and a sudden gust extinguishes the flames that have sprung up around us. As the smoke clears, she gazes into my eyes and speaks slowly, her voice wrapping around me like a silken noose. "Your nightmare will be your undoing," she whispers. "To face it is your only hope." Then the world blurs and darkness takes me.
