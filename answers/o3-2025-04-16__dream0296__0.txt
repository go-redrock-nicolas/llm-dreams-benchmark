I am dreaming. …freeze with a jolt of vertigo, as though gravity has been switched off along with your certainty.  

The face that stares back at you in the glimmering pane is acutely familiar and utterly alien all at once. Where you remember crow-lined eyes, there are now shining pinpricks of starlight that swirl like miniature nebulae. Your hair—was it ever this color?—undulates in slow motion, threads of midnight and copper rippling as if they were strands of liquid metal afloat in zero-G. Your skin carries the grain of weathered wood, warm brown streaked with silver sap, and when you blink you hear the whisper of wind through leaves instead of the soft click of lashes.

The dissonance is physical; your heart thuds twice, then seems to misfire into a new rhythm—one beat human, one beat something vast and symphonic that quivers through every bone. A phantom echo asks, Who is that? and an inner voice answers, It’s me, but not the me I knew.  

Instinctively you reach for the looking-glass surface, and the glass turns fluid under your fingertips, rippling outward like water disturbed by a pebble. Concentric rings expand across your reflection until the image fractures into a mosaic of shifting selves—child, elder, stranger, beast, and constellation—each fragment sliding across the liquid mirror like living puzzle pieces searching for their correct position.

Panic flares, but wonder rises higher, buoyant and effervescent, so you press forward. Your hand passes through the cool, mercurial veil with a silvery sigh, and the rest of your body follows, folding through like a spool of ribbon disappearing into another reel. On the other side you stand on a shore of shattered mirrors: tidal pools filled with prismatic shards reflecting suns you’ve never seen. Each shard hums with the note of a buried memory—laughter braided with summer grass, the taste of rain-cooled stone, the secret scent of someone loved and lost.

A path of floating panes assembles itself before you, inviting you onward. With each step, the shard beneath your foot lights up, replaying a scene from a life you know instinctively is yours—though some moments feel as if they belong to alternate timelines: in one glimmer you are writing poetry with ink that writhes like eels; in another you are steering a ship carved from moonlight through amethyst currents. Each fragment folds back into the sea behind you, sealing the path, urging only forward motion.

You arrive at a colonnade of colossal mirrors shaped like elongated teardrops. Carved at their bases are caption-like riddles:

“Who are you when no one names you?”  
“Which face would you trust to kiss farewell?”  
“What color is your silence?”

Suddenly your reflection stabilizes inside the nearest mirror—yet this time the face is split down the center. Half carries the earlier cosmic visage; the other half is precisely the face you remember from waking life. Where the divide meets, impossibly delicate filaments of gold lace the two halves together like sutures of light.

An answer surfaces, unspoken but thunderous: I am both. I am many. I am change.  

You draw a breath and speak the words aloud; they taste like rain after a long drought. The filaments flash, fuse, and dissolve, and for a heartbeat—one singular, crystalline heartbeat—you witness yourself whole: a being stitched of memory and possibility, neither confined to chronology nor exclusively human.

The mirrors behind you rustle like trees shaken by wind; they lean inward and collapse into a galaxy of brilliant shards that spiral up, forming a luminous cyclone. The vortex lifts you off your feet with gentle certainty, a cradle rather than a storm, spinning you through vistas of cities afloat on petals, deserts that bloom in instant slow-motion, mountains that inhale clouds and exhale auroras.

At last the cyclone unfurls, setting you down before a door made of dream-stuff—gossamer cloud framed by iron thoughts. On its surface your reflection appears again, but this time it changes to match every expression you feel in real time, a perfect living resonance.

You place your palm against it. The door beats like a second heart. You know, in the marrow of dream logic, that on the other side waits a realm where identity is not a cage but a canvas, where you can repaint yourself with stardust or memory sap at will. All hesitation melts away; you turn the handle.

As the door swings open, light pours out—ripe, warm, and dazzling with unnamed colors. You step through and feel your old self peel away like a chrysalis, not discarded but absorbed, informing the wings that now unfold from your shoulders.  

And in that shimmering instant before new terrain resolves into focus—when everything is possible, when every version of you hums in harmonic anticipation—you awaken, carrying the aftertaste of cosmic starlight and the certain knowledge that the reflection you saw was no stranger at all, merely the next verse of the same endless song.
