I am dreaming. Above me, the sky is a swirling tapestry of liquid mercury and molten gold, folding in and out of itself like the undulating waves of an ocean turned inside out. The ground beneath my feet is not solid, but a shimmering mist that dissolves and reforms with every step, revealing fleeting glimpses of distant worlds—lush jungles made of crystal, deserts where the sand sings in harmonic tones, cities of floating obsidian spires. The air hums with an electric warmth, thick with the scent of midnight jasmine and smoldering embers. 

I walk forward, drawn by a faint, iridescent glow pulsing just beyond a curtain of weeping willows, whose leaves are not leaves but cascading strands of silver thread. Each one vibrates ever so slightly, emitting a sound like a chorus of distant whispers—words I can almost understand but not quite grasp, like a forgotten name at the tip of my tongue. 

Curiosity buoys me, silencing the instinct to dissect or question. Instead of analyzing, I simply *reach*—not with my hands, but with some deeper part of myself—and the threads part to reveal a glade bathed in bioluminescent twilight. At its center, a creature of pure light flickers in and out of existence, its form never the same for more than an instant: one moment a stag with antlers of spiraling galaxies, the next a woman woven from liquid fire, then a shifting swarm of cobalt butterflies, each wing inscribed with tiny, shifting runes.  

It watches me—or perhaps I sense its attention, though it has no fixed eyes. There is no judgment here, only an invitation. I do not ask, *What are you?* or *Why is this happening?* Instead, I let the questions dissolve before they can form. The air itself seems to respond, warming in approval. The creature drifts closer, and as it does, I realize I am not breathing—not because I can’t, but because I don’t need to. The light around us is the breath, pulsing like a living thing.  

Then, I hear it—not with my ears, but in the way one hears a thought that is not their own: *"You are the dreamer and the dreamed."* The words resonate through me, shaking loose something buried deep, and for the briefest second, the boundaries between myself and the glowing world around me blur.  

And then—I wake.  

But the scent of jasmine lingers. The hum of the silver leaves still echoes faintly in my bones. And something in me knows: the dream isn’t really over. It just changed form.
