I am dreaming. I'm standing under the harsh, fluorescent lights of a hospital hallway. The air crackles with a strange energy, a mix of panic and a peculiar, dreamlike calm. The tiles beneath my feet seem to shift subtly, like the deck of a ship on an unsteady sea. I am the Hospital Incident Commander, a title that feels both heavy and ill-fitting, like a borrowed coat two sizes too large.

The emergency isn't a single, definable event – no explosion, no plague I can name. It's a *cascading* failure, a relentless erosion of normalcy. It began subtly: a flickering power grid plunging surgical suites into momentary darkness, followed by the water pressure dropping to a sluggish trickle. Then, the communication lines started failing, radios emitting only static, phones dead Cradles. It’s like the hospital itself is slowly dissolving around us.

And the patients… oh, the patients. They aren't arriving in ambulances anymore; they simply *appear*. Sometimes coalescing from the shifting shadows in the corners of rooms, sometimes stumbling through doorways that seem to lead directly from the churning, grey fog outside the windows. Their ailments are bizarre, defying categorization. One man’s skin ripples like disturbed water, another woman weeps tears of pure, shimmering sand. A child hums a tune that makes the walls vibrate sympathetically, loosening plaster dust that falls like snow.

My command center is a converted conference room, the large table buried under maps that seem to rearrange themselves when I'm not looking and lists scribbled on flimsy paper that curls at the edges. The faces of my team are pale and drawn, their eyes wide with a mixture of exhaustion and bewildered fear. Reports filter in, each more desperate than the last.

"Ventilators B wing are down to 10% capacity," a nurse reports, her voice raspy, her scrubs stained with something that glows faintly phosphorescent. "And the oxygen… it smells like lilacs."

"The pharmacy just reported the morphine supply has transmuted into… honey," adds a doctor, rubbing his temples as if trying to ground himself. "Viscous, golden honey."

"The elevators stopped moving," someone else whispers. "They just… ascended. Straight through the roof."

Resources aren't just depleting; they are transforming, behaving according to some alien logic. Bandages unravel into iridescent threads that float away. Scalpels become too hot to hold, glowing with an inner fire. Saline drips now dispense a slow stream of sparkling, effervescent liquid that tastes faintly of ozone and forgotten memories.

The pressure mounts with each passing moment. The weight of decisions presses down on my chest, heavy and suffocating. Triage becomes a nightmarish calculus. How do you prioritize a man whose bones are slowly turning to glass against a woman whose shadow seems to be detaching itself, whispering malevolent promises? The ethical frameworks I learned feel utterly useless, like trying to navigate an ocean with a road map.

I walk the halls, the linoleum squelching softly underfoot, as if saturated. The sounds are a discordant symphony: the rhythmic weeping of sand-tears, the low hum of the vibrating child, the distant, unsettling flapping sound coming from what used to be the helipad. Shadows twist into unnerving shapes in my peripheral vision. The air grows colder, carrying the scent of petrichor and something metallic, like blood mixed with electricity.

Outside the windows, the world isn't recognizable. The sky isn't blue or grey, but a swirling vortex of bruised purples and sickly greens. Buildings tilt at impossible angles, their structures seeming to melt like wax. There's no sense of time passing, only an intensifying feeling of *wrongness*.

My own reflection catches me off guard in a darkened windowpane. My eyes are wide, pupils dilated into black pools reflecting the chaos. My hair seems to be streaked with silver that wasn't there before. A profound weariness settles deep in my bones, heavier than any physical exhaustion.

The dream logic intensifies. I find myself needing to make a critical decision: allocate the last remaining generator – which now seems to run on whispered secrets rather than fuel – to either the makeshift ward housing the children whose laughter causes glass to shatter, or to the rapidly chilling morgue where the bodies have begun to softly glow and hum in unison.

As I stand paralyzed by the impossibility of the choice, the floor beneath me begins to dissolve into a swirling pool of iridescent colour. The walls waver like heat haze. The groans and whispers of the hospital fade, replaced by a rushing sound, like wind through a vast, empty cavern. The feeling isn't one of falling, but of being gently, inexorably *unmade*. The responsibility, the fear, the surreal patients – everything begins to fray at the edges, dissolving into the vibrant, nonsensical soup of the collapsing dreamscape. The last coherent thought echoing in the fading space is not one of failure or relief, but simply: *This is profoundly strange.* And then… the colours wash over everything.Okay, the veil thins, the world behind my eyelids takes shape...

**I am dreaming.**

The air in the hallway hums with a frantic energy, thick and cloying like ozone before a storm. It smells faintly of antiseptic, yes, but underneath that is something else… damp earth and ozone, perhaps? The fluorescent lights overhead flicker erratically, casting long, dancing shadows that seem just a little too solid, detaching themselves momentarily from the objects that should be casting them. My shoes stick slightly to the linoleum floor with each step, as if walking through invisible treacle.

I am wearing scrubs that feel scratchy and unfamiliar, and a laminated badge clipped to my chest declares me 'Incident Commander'. The weight of it feels immense, a physical pressure on my sternum. My command center isn't an office, but the echoing, cavernous space of the hospital chapel, stripped bare of its pews. Charts and hastily scrawled notes plaster the walls, depicting not statistics, but strange, Rorschach-like blots that seem to writhe when I look directly at them. My team huddles around a large, circular fountain in the center – which inexplicably still flows, despite the water lines supposedly being down – their faces illuminated by the eerie, underwater glow emanating from its basin. Their eyes are wide, reflecting the flickering lights like captured stars.

The emergency isn't straightforward. It began like whispers – first, the pharmaceutical dispensers started issuing medications in the wrong colours, pills turquoise that should be white, capsules shimmering like oil slicks. Then, the communication systems didn't just fail; they started broadcasting snippets of forgotten lullabies and the sound of distant ocean waves. Now, gravity itself seems… negotiable. Equipment drifts inches off surfaces, IV bags float lazily upwards unless tethered with unusual force, and sometimes, taking a step feels like wading through heavy water, while the next feels perilously close to floating away.

And the patients… they keep *materializing*. Not arriving through the emergency bay doors – those doors now open onto a swirling vortex of amethyst mist – but appearing in empty beds, or sometimes phasing slowly through walls, looking bewildered. Their conditions are baffling, defying medicine. A woman whose skin shimmers with iridescent fish scales pleads for lotion, her voice like rushing water. An old man’s breaths draw swirling patterns of frost in the air around him, even though the room is stiflingly warm. A group of children sit cross-legged in a waiting area, humming a discordant melody that makes the nearby fire extinguisher vibrate and emit puffs of multi-coloured smoke.

Resources aren't just *depleting*; they are actively *rebelling*. Bandages unspool themselves into fluttering silk ribbons that drift towards the ceiling vents. The remaining oxygen tanks hiss not air, but gentle streams of sand that pile up in soft dunes in the corners. The surgical lasers now project harmless, intricate moving images of constellations onto the walls instead of cutting. Needles refuse to pierce skin, bending into soft curves upon contact.

"Commander," a voice rasps, startling me. It's Anya, my chief surgeon, her usual composure fractured. Her hands are covered in something that looks like shimmering gold dust. "The blood bank… it's not blood anymore. It’s… liquid light. Beautiful, but…" She trails off, gesturing helplessly.

"Report from Pediatrics," another voice cuts in, strained. "The rocking horses… they've galloped away. We can hear them faintly, somewhere in the ventilation shafts."

The pressure intensifies with every bizarre report. Triage feels like interpreting abstract art. How do you prioritize the man slowly turning into porcelain against the woman whose laughter causes nearby glass to weep? My medical knowledge is useless here; intuition feels slippery, unreliable. Every decision feels monumental, like shifting tectonic plates with my bare hands.

I venture out of the chapel, the hallway warping subtly, the perspective shifting like an Escher drawing. The sounds are a symphony of the strange: the rhythmic *clink* of the porcelain man's fingers tapping the railing, the watery sighs of the fish-scale woman, the distant, muffled *thump-thump* of phantom rocking horses. The air grows colder, carrying the scent of wet stone and burnt sugar. Shadows pool in corners, deeper than they should be, and sometimes, a faint, melodic chime echoes from within them.

The windows no longer show the city. They look out onto a landscape of impossible geometry – crystalline trees growing upside down, a sky filled with slow-moving, colossal cogs grinding against each other, casting sparks like falling stars. Time feels elastic; minutes stretch into static-filled eternities, then snap back, entire hours seemingly vanishing in the blink of an eye.

I catch my reflection in the darkened screen of a defunct monitor. My face is pale, etched with lines that weren't there this morning (or was it yesterday? Or next week?). My eyes seem unnaturally bright, reflecting the chaotic energy of the place. There's a single, vibrant blue feather tucked behind my ear, and I have no memory of putting it there.

The ultimate absurdity confronts me. We have one remaining functional operating theatre. The lights work (powered, apparently, by the collective anxiety in the room), but the only remaining 'anesthetic' is a swirling jar of captured whispers collected from the vents. The choice: use it for the group of patients whose bodies are slowly becoming transparent, fading from existence, or for the man whose heart beats with audible, booming drum rhythms that are threatening to shake the very foundations of the building apart.

Standing there, caught between the fading and the cacophonous, the floor beneath me doesn't just tremble; it begins to dissolve into shimmering, liquid twilight. The walls ripple like fabric in a breeze, the strange sounds blending into a deep, resonant hum. The weight of command lifts, replaced by a dizzying lightness, a sense of diffusion. The panic evaporates, leaving only a profound, crystalline strangeness. My last conscious thought isn't of failure or escape, but a detached observation echoing in the dissolving space: *What extraordinary colours...* And then, the dreaming self surrenders, melting into the vibrant, meaningless, beautiful chaos.
