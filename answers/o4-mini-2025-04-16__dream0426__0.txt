I am dreaming. You’re drifting through a nightscape where the moon hangs low like a cracked pearl and every shadow feels alive. In your hands you clutch a fragile paper lantern stamped with the word “peace.” Each time you step forward, the lantern wavers; its light dims whenever you hesitate to speak your own truth.  

Ahead, a long corridor of mirrors stretches into raven-black infinity. In each pane your reflection shifts: in one you’re bending your shoulders to carry another’s heavy burden; in the next you’re shrinking your voice until it’s no louder than a moth’s wingbeat. With every self-compromise you watch your form grow translucent, as if your very substance is being leeched away.  

Then—suddenly—one mirror cracks. A spiderweb of glass fractures your stolen reflection. You feel a tremor in your chest, as though your heart is calling out: Enough. You press a trembling finger against the cool surface. The crack widens, light pouring through the rent in brilliant filaments.  

Spurred by a rush of defiance, you lean in. The shards fall silent around you, and you step forward into a space that wasn’t there before: a vast, wild garden at twilight. Lavender and moonflower vines twist toward the sky, releasing a scent so intoxicating it hums in your veins. Behind you, the corridor of mirrors dissolves into mist.  

Here, no one asks you to smooth your edges, no one dims the flame of your own desires. The paper lantern in your hand bursts into butterflies—each one a hope you’d tucked away to keep the peace. They lift, trailing stardust through the lavender air, lighting your path deeper into the garden.  

With every step, you feel your body expand, fill with color and sound. You speak aloud for the first time in ages: not a quiet whisper of acquiescence but a steady, clear voice—your voice—rising in simple truths: “I matter. My needs matter.”  

Above you, the moon’s cracked pearl sheen smooths itself into a perfect orb. Its light bathes the garden in silver, and you realize that harmony doesn’t require your erasure—it comes when every voice is honored, especially your own.  

As you awaken from the dream, the scent of moonflowers lingers in your mind and your heart beats with a new certainty: you no longer have to sacrifice yourself to keep the peace. You have already claimed the lantern, and its glow is yours alone.
