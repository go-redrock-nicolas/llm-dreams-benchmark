I am dreaming. I sink into the dreamworld, where reality bends in vibrant colors and everything is acutely, almost overwhelmingly felt. Around me, the landscape pulses—emerald forests shimmer under a moody violet sky, their leaves humming softly, a sound I feel in my very bones. I’m acutely aware of how these places clutch at my energy, either wrapping me in warm currents of life or leaching the spark from my soul.

As I wander, I notice my own glow—a comet-tail of light streaming behind me, swinging in hue with each environment I pass through. The thick woods soothe my spirit, saturating me with a golden luminosity that tingles along my skin. In a flash, I cross into a steel cityscape, washed in cold blue neon. Here, the ether closes in, and my light shrinks, flickering, a candle caught in a draft.

Honoring this new wisdom, I choose my way with care. I step from the city’s bleaching chill, into a sun-drenched glade where wildflowers sway like a painted sea. The air here tastes of honey and old dreams—the type that linger even when you wake. I sink to the mossy ground. I feel each blade of grass, every flutter of tiny wings in the air, feeding my spirit until I am incandescent again.

In this dream, I become a quiet gardener of my own energy, cultivating the places that fill me up and letting the draining spaces blur and slide away, unreachable, shadows at the edge of an ever-brightening field. Here, in the deepest parts of my imagining, the environment is my symphony, and my soul dances to its music, restored.
