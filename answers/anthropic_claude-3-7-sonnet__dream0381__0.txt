I am dreaming. Veiled in twilight's embrace, I stand at the edge of a circular garden unlike any I've known before. Pathways spiral inward like the chambers of a nautilus shell, each bordered by flowers that pulse with soft bioluminescence—blues and purples that whisper rather than shout. The air carries the scent of rain-soaked earth and something indefinable that reminds me of childhood.

I recognize this place somehow. I've been here before, many times, always drawn to its center where a domed pavilion of intricate latticework stands, gleaming like mother-of-pearl. The strange magnetism pulls me forward along the winding path, each step both delightful and increasingly uneasy.

As I approach the pavilion, the flowers begin to dim, their light receding like a tide. The structure's beauty intensifies—impossibly delicate arches and spirals that couldn't exist in waking life—but shadows now dance within its framework. Still, I cannot resist its call. I've never been able to.

Inside, mirrored surfaces fragment my reflection into countless versions of myself, each showing a different moment I've chosen beauty over truth, comfort over growth, familiarity over necessary change. The pattern is unmistakable—I am my own labyrinth, architect of my own recurring pain.

The realization doesn't come as words but as a profound bodily knowing. The pavilion trembles. Cracks appear in its perfect surface. Instead of fleeing as I always have before, I place my palm against the fracturing wall and whisper, "I see you now."

The structure dissolves into thousands of luminous butterflies that swirl around me before dispersing into the night sky, leaving me standing in a garden now fully illuminated, paths no longer spiraling but opening outward in all directions.
