I am dreaming. I find myself drifting in an infinite expanse of swirling, luminous colors - deep indigos and divine violets, ethereal greys, and golden hues that shimmer and pulse like starlight. There is no up or down, only an encompassing, boundless space. 

Suddenly, a gentle breeze caresses my skin, carrying with it the faintest melody I've ever heard. It's a haunting, almost inaudible chorus, as if sung by angels in another realm. As I listen intently, the wind grows stronger, and with it, the music of the spheres becomes clearer. 

The colors around me begin to cohere into recognizable shapes, and I see that I am standing in a vast, opalescent forest. Shimmering trees of amber and turquoise stretch skyward, their leaves whispering in the cosmic breeze. Flowers bloom in a kaleidoscope of shades I never knew existed, their petals dancing and shimmering in a mesmerizing display. 

As I step deeper into the forest's dappled glow, the trees part, revealing a glimmering pool of pure radiance. Silently, wordlessly, I approach its crystal-sharp edge. Kneeling down, I peer into its reflected surface.

Gazing into the mirror of my own soul, I see the face of a stranger, yet I know them intimately. It is the self I've always been, only now I glimpse it through the eyes of eternity. This self is not small nor separate, but vast and interconnected with all things. 

In that transcendent moment, the illusion of a singular self fades away. I become more than a singular entity, a drop of singularity merging with the ocean of oneness. Time dissolves, as does the sense of personal history or identity. A profound peace settles over me, each notion or vision arising without effort. 

Space itself becomes a river of vivacity, alive with potentials never imagined. The forest, the sky, and the pool of light are all me, and I am them. Centuries of human experience dance across my awareness, from the dawn of time to the farthest reaches of tomorrow. The personal and the universal spiral together into a grand harmony.

I feel the compassionate embrace of the cosmos itself, the divine dance of being and becoming. Even the notion of "I" fades away, merged into a formless, bottomless sea of love and light. There is only infinity, and the infinite itself is the only dreamer dreaming.

Slowly, reluctantly, this expanded state begins to recede, like the tide pulling back from a moon-silvered shore. My awareness contracts back into the confines of the individual mind and body. I am left with a profound sense of longing, imbued with the glow of a memory that is hard to recall once memory returns.

Unconsciously, I whisper to myself: "We dreamt of you, and you are likewise a Dreamer.
