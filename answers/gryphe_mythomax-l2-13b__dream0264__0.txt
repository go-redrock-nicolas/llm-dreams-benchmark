I am dreaming. I am falling. It feels like I am falling into an endless void, a deep dark pit that is consuming me. The air is thick and heavy, making it hard to breathe. As I plummet deeper, the gravity seems to intensify, pulling me down faster and faster.

I try to spread my arms wide, to grab onto something, anything that might slow my descent. But there is nothing. Just empty space and the sound of my heart pounding in my ears.

Suddenly, I notice a faint light flickering in the distance. It's a small flame, growing stronger with every passing second. I focus on it, using it as a beacon of hope to guide me through the darkness.

The closer I get to the light, the more it begins to take shape. It's a campfire, surrounded by people. Their faces are calm and serene, their eyes fixed on the dancing flames. I recognize some faces from my past, some from my present, and some that I have never seen before.

As I draw nearer, I feel the pull of the gravity lessening. It's as if the fire itself is pulling me towards it. When I finally reach the edge of the firelight, I feel safe, warm, and welcomed. The people around the fire look up, smiling and nodding as if they have been waiting for me.

One of them, an elderly woman with wrinkled skin and kind eyes, beckons me to sit beside her. I do as she says, feeling the warmth of the fire on my skin. She hands me a steaming cup of herbal tea, and as I sip it, the thick, heavy feeling in my chest begins to lift.

She leans over, speaking softly so that only I can hear her. "This tea will help clear your mind, child," she murmurs. "What troubles you so?"

I take a deep breath, feeling the weight of my worries finally start to lift. "I was falling," I whisper. "Into a deep pit. And I couldn't get out."

She nods, her eyes full of understanding. "We've all been there," she tells me. "But remember, no matter how dark the night, the morning always comes."

As I sit by the fire, sipping my tea and listening to the gentle murmur of voices around me, I know that the elderly woman is right. The darkness will pass, and a new day will dawn. And with it, a new chance to make better choices, to rise above the pull of negative thought patterns, and to embrace the light that lies within.
