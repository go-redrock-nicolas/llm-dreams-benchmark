I am dreaming. You remember this dream and feel bad about what happened to the other you in the dream. You decide to try again and create another dream where you can have a second chance at life without any interruptions or setbacks. This time, you vow to be more careful, cautious, and diligent. Maybe then, you might find happiness and fulfillment.
