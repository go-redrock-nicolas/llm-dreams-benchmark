I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me bleeds color like an unhealed wound—emerald light spills in through high stained-glass windows, casting fractured patterns across the floor. The room I am in is luxurious, ancient-seeming, like something from a long-forgotten castle turned into a temple. Pillars run impossibly high, curling up to a ceiling I can't see. I sit in a velvet armchair, the fabric cool but yielding to my touch. Let's call this place the chamber of echoes.

Across from me is... a soul on fire.

They sit not on a chair but on a levitating disk of obsidian, spinning ever so slightly as their shoulders rise and fall with the exertion of each breath. Their skin shimmers with a faint inner glow—like sunlight caught in gold leaf. Their hair is dark and wild, winds moving through it even though there is no wind. Their eyes are twin eclipses, dark holes rimmed with light, tremors of emotion seething just beneath.

They speak in whispers, wails, and metaphors. “It feels like I'm unspooling,” they say. “Like I never got to be me, and now I'm whatever everyone else carved out of the silence they left behind.” Their voice cracks like winter ice on a frozen pond.

I respond, but not with ordinary words. Here, in this dream chamber, the rules bend. When I speak, each syllable takes form—a gentle unfolding like origami made of starlight. What I say is compassion incarnate, and it wraps around them in trailing vines of soft light, not to stifle, but to hold. They flinch at first, but then lean into it.

I guide them inward because no escape—from pain—is ever found in flight. “Tell me what it means to unspool,” I say, and a luminous mirror materializes beside them, tall and frameless, its shimmer humming with possibility.

They rise, unsteady, and approach it. The mirror does not show their face. It shows a storm in a forest long abandoned—lightning merging with roots, echoes of screamed names buried in the earth. “I built myself louder and louder until I couldn’t find the quiet parts of me,” they whisper. “And now I've lost the silence, and there’s just this empty scream inside.”

They aren’t crying with their eyes, but their entire body trembles with a sorrow too deep for tears. So I reach across the space between us and touch the air beside them. From that space grows a tree—skeletal, slow-growing, with leaves that glow translucent green, like jade suspended in moonlight. Its bark spells out forgotten promises in a language of scars.

"You can build again," I say, and the air thrums as though the words traveled not just to them, but into them, etching themselves into the spaces where truth belongs.

A child’s laugh echoes suddenly, sharp and pure against the stormy EEG rhythm of their despair. A flicker of movement—someone small runs past through the tree's roots. No one sees them clearly. But the figure in front of me shudders, exhaling deeply for the first time.

“I forgot her,” they say. “The child I was.”

I nod.

The storm in the mirror dissipates. The tree grows upward, stretching beyond the viewable space of the chamber. Where their roots had been torn and upturned, a garden now blooms in secret pockets of their being. They sit back on the obsidian disk, now radiant and still, their breath unbroken for the first time.

Their face, once shadowed by the eclipse-eyes, begins to soften. They look at me. They say something, but not in voice. I feel it. *Thank you—because someone finally listened like it mattered whether I stayed or disappeared.*

Then I awaken.

Back in my self.

Heart full.

Mind aching.

Dream still vibrating behind my closed lids.

And I realize—for all the strangeness of this place of mirrors and levitating black stones—this was never about magic.

It was about holding space for someone else’s soul to see itself in gentler light.

And now, lifting from the dream, I wonder...Who will sit opposite *me* the next time *I* need to be unspooled and quietly woven whole again?
