I am dreaming. Let me paint for you a rich tapestry of the unconscious mind, a landscape where reality bends and time flows like molten glass.

The dream begins in a vast library that stretches infinitely in all directions. The shelves are carved from living walnut trees that still bear golden leaves, their branches intertwining to form archways dripping with knowledge. You walk barefoot across floors of warm amber, each step causing ancient texts to flutter their pages like butterflies waking from sleep.

Suddenly you notice - there are no letters on any page. The books are blank yet humming with significance. A librarian approaches, their face constantly shifting between all the people you've ever known. They hand you a key made of starlight that burns cold against your palm.

When you insert it into your own chest, your ribs swing open like cathedral doors revealing not organs, but an entire universe within. Stars swirl around a central black hole that pulses like a heart. The event horizon whispers secrets in a language of forgotten colors.

You realize with cosmic certainty this is your scarcity. Though your internal universe teems with infinite potential, your waking mind perceives only emptiness. The dream shakes violently as the library shelves collapse into origami galaxies. The last thing you hear before waking is your own voice echoing from the void: "Abundance was never the absence of lack, but the presence of vision."
