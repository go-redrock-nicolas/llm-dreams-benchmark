I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The sky overhead ripples like oil on water, shifting from violet to molten gold in the blink of an eye. Beneath your feet, the ground pulses softly, as though each step awakens a hidden heartbeat in the earth itself. You had expected your familiar bedroom’s hush—but you find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, glassy plain, its horizon broken by floating monoliths dripping with glowing vines. No warning, no time to gather your bearings—only the drum of your own pulse in your ears, louder now than any sound in this world.  

As you move forward, the monoliths begin to descend around you, each one bearing a different impossible scene pressed into its surface: a forest of coral that sings in ultraviolet notes, a storm of feathery butterflies the size of whales, a city skyline built on clouds that crumbles and rebuilds itself in endless fraction-of-a-second loops. You reach out, and your fingertips brush one of those scenes—suddenly you’re inside it. You stand on a coral branch that hums beneath your weight; the violet birds swirl around you, their wings brushing your eyelids as they dart toward a glowing gale on the horizon.  

A breeze sweeps through, carrying the faint scent of cinnamon and thunder. You sense movement in your periphery: millions of tiny lights rising from the plain like fireflies, coalescing into a colossal shape—a translucent giant whose eyes are ancient constellations. It reaches toward you, not with hands but with a flood of warmth, and in that embrace you feel every emotion you’ve ever had: childhood glee, first heartbreak, triumphant joy, quiet despair. Time fractures. You feel both decades and seconds passing all at once.  

Suddenly, the giant’s form dissolves into hundreds of lanterns, each drifting off into the purple-gold sky. The monoliths have vanished, the plain has rippled away, and you stand at the mouth of a forest whose trees have trunks carved like keys and branches that spiral up into darkness. Somewhere behind you, the faint echo of a bell chimes—three notes, then a pause, then three more. You realize you’re on the threshold of something even stranger, and though your heart races with uncertainty, an odd sense of wonder anchors you. You take a single step forward—and the dream unfolds again, richer and more bewildering than before.
