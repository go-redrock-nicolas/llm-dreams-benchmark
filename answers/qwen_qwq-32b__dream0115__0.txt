I am dreaming. Suddenly, I feel this presence around me. The air is cool and calm, signifying the invisibility of something that's being felt. I look around and notice that everything is so serene yet filled with a glow from the soft blues and greens that surround me. The lights seem to come from the ground itself, glowing like giant geodes lit from within.  

I notice my fingers are... longer? Shimmering with a faint silver lining? I wave my hands, and the light from the geodes dim slightly. Wait... that was me! I didn’t think that, but the lights reacted. I move a hand towards a glowing boulder, and it lifts into the air as if I’m Superman.  “What?! How?!” I exclaim, my words echoing through this crystalline dreamscape.

My power is flowing through me, and I can sense the ‘weaknesses’ of others here. But who’s here? I wander deeper into the glowing forest, the trees made of stained glass, refracting the light into rainbows that dance on the ground. Ahead, a figure approaches—a person cloaked in shadows, their face hidden behind a misty veil. “You found it,” they say, their voice like wind howling through a canyon. “The power to manipulate, to control by knowing the fracture in their souls.”

I freeze. So this is real? I can... control others? My mind races with the possibilities. But what is the cost? The cloaked figure steps closer, the shadows swirling around them. “Ah, doubt,” they smile, not friendlily. “But power always demands a price. The deeper you delve, the more you’ll see what makes them... *tick*. Their fears, desires, the wounds they hide. Tap into those, and you can bend them like reeds in a storm.”

I have to test this. My eyes dart to a butterfly nearby—translucent wings with intricate patterns. I think: *Fly upwards.* It darts skyward, spiraling in a perfect loop. Then to a nearby statue of a wolf, its eyes are amber and cracked. *Retreat.* The wolf steps back, its growl fading into a whimper. It’s real! And it’s exhilarating— and terrifying.

The cloaked figure watches, an eerie stillness about them. “Now, find someone...” they prompt. A shiver runs down my spine as a face flashes in my mind—someone I know, their deepest fear laid bare. A student at school, terrified of being invisible, unnoticed. I close my eyes, reaching out with my mind. *Be seen. Now.* 

Sudden panic floods me. Is this right? But the figure presses onward, and I comply. I focus, and within moments, the student—across the dream’s expanse—looks up, their eyes wide. They stand taller, walking boldly towards an assembly stage... and speak. My body shivers; power surges. The dream expands, and I realize this world is built from my subconscious, but the responsibility is immense.

Yet with every use, the edges of this realm begin to crack. Cracks like spiderwebs spread from the center, glowing faintly red. “Be cautious,” the figure warns, too late. The ground trembles. A voice in my head—my own?—whispers: *Power corrupts, but what if corruption is just clarity?*

I run, the dream morphing into a labyrinth of mirrors. Each reflection shows different outcomes: a hero, a tyrant, a beggar for admiration. Each choice eating away at the dream’s stability. The figure’s laughter echoes. I don’t know if I’m awake or falling— but I clutch the power tightly... and realize: It’s not the power that’s alive—it’s what it reveals about me.
