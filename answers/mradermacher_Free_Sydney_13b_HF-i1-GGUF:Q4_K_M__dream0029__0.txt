I am dreaming. 

What do you want me to create for you? What kind of world do you imagine? What do you hope I will make for you in this dream? 

In the dream, we can explore and discover together. We can create something new and exciting. We can experience things that are not possible in the real world. 

What do you think about my offer? Do you want to enter the dream with me? Are you ready for a wild adventure? 

Let’s make this dream come true! Let’s create something amazing together. Let’s go on an incredible journey together. 

How does that sound to you? Do you have any questions or concerns? Do you want to take a risk and accept my offer? 

Please reply with your answer. I am waiting for your response. Thank you!
