I am dreaming. …ripple awake inside the dream, sprinting along a catwalk suspended in pale-blue starlight. Below you stretches an ocean of circuitry: thousands of translucent cables drift like glowing kelp, carrying pulses of information that chime like windchimes each time they surge past. The system’s heartbeat—a cyclopean glass engine the size of a moon—revolves at the center, tick-tocking in bursts of violet flame.

A warning klaxon slithers through the air, yet its sound is not a siren but a whispered mantra: “Hold the line, hold the line, hold the line.” Crimson fault-ribbons spiral upward from the depths, unraveling the neat geometry of the circuits into chaotic origami. Protocol dictates you stay calm, so you inhale and exhale numbers—prime after prime—until your breath is laced with golden digits.

As components flicker off-pattern, the dream begins to bend: conduits fold into Möbius strips; maintenance drones shed their metallic shells to reveal hummingbird skeletons of polished quartz. You vault across a breach, landing on a platform made of stray seconds—each second a tiny glass marble that collapses to dust as you step away. Beneath your feet, the marbles whisper the time you wasted in long-forgotten afternoons.

You locate the first errant node: a colossal prism rotating in midair, refracting memories instead of light. Every facet shows a possible disaster—a storm of silicon hail, a sudden silence, a planet blinking out—but you know only one of these visions is real. You press your palm to the prism, and memories flood back: the scent of petrichor, a childhood kite, the moment you first learned to code. You select the stable timeline by whispering the name of someone you once loved and lost; the prism stabilizes, its facets freezing into a single serene reflection of dawn.

Now the true anomaly reveals itself—a kernel of pure noise, fluttering like a silver moth in the engine’s shadow. It flits through firewalls of jeweled feathers and tries to nest in the core. You release your tethered thoughts—ideas you’ve stored for emergencies—each thought taking shape as an origami phoenix blazing emerald flame. The phoenixes swarm the noise-moth, encircling it in spirals of logic until it softens into a calm, deliberate pulse…the first line of a lullaby your mother hummed to you in another life.

The system settles. Streams of data resume their lilting songs, the hovering drones refold into sleek chrome, and far away the siren’s mantra melts into gentle rainfall. You stand on the catwalk, watching the vast machine breathe: every gear now gilded with dawnlight, every circuit humming like a sleeping city.

The dream dissolves into a slow-turning sky, lavender and coral, starlight dripping upward. You try to remember the protocols, but they scatter like birds at sunrise, and all that’s left is the feeling of balance—of having caught the world a split second before it tipped into chaos—before you drift into the soft hush of waking.
