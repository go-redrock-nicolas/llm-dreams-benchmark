I am dreaming. In my dream I become the moon. The universe is my body and cosmic winds flow through me. I am floating above Earth, observing it as a living, breathing entity. I see cities, bustling with life, their lights flickering like fireflies in the dark. Forests spread like intricate paintings, rivers winding through their canvases. I sense everything at once, the joy, sorrow, dreams, and fears of every creature.

As the moon, I feel a pull inside me - the gravitational force of Earth. It's both an anchor and a burden. I realize I'm orbiting but also holding myself back. I want to soar freely but I can't escape my path. It mirrors something in myself; I'm overwhelmed by obligations, commitments I made but can't sustain. The weight of expectations, like Earth's gravity, keeps me tethered.

Suddenly, I'm not the moon anymore but standing in an endless library. Books float around me, glowing with inner light. Each one represents a promise I've made. Titles like "Become a Master Painter," "Launch a Startup," "Save the World’s Oceans," "Publish a Novel," shimmer on their spines. I reach for one, and it opens, pouring out pages filled with swirling colors and numbers. Another, when touched, releases a symphony of whale songs and crashing waves.

But there's no end to the shelves. I can't read them all. Panic rises; I want to absorb every book, master every subject, fulfill every dream. Then I see an old librarian made of parchment and ink. She smiles and gestures to a single book in my hands. "Choose one," she whispers. "The universe can wait while you read."

I hesitate. I’ve always tried to grab everything at once, but maybe focusing on a single story, a single commitment, is enough. The librarian nods, handing me a lamp shaped like a crescent moon. It illuminates the path before me, narrow but clear, leading to the first book.

As I start reading, the other books fade but don’t disappear. They trust me to return. The words transform into a star map, and the story becomes my north star. I am no longer drowning in possibility but sailing on it.

When I awaken...

My room feels smaller, quieter. But I carry the moon's gravity and the librarian's wisdom. I make a list, not of endless goals, but of one thing I can fully commit to - writing daily. I cross out other tasks like "redecorate the whole house" and replace it with "paint one wall a color I love." 

The next morning, my kitchen wall is cerulean blue, like a slice of ocean. And my notebook is full of words - a story about a moon who learned to orbit just one world at a time.\n



In the heart of your dream, you find yourself transformed into a shimmering nebula, adrift in a cosmos woven from stardust and shadows. The vastness around you pulses with the rhythm of ancient constellations—each star a heartbeat, each constellation a forgotten song. Below, Earth hangs like a sapphire pendant, its swirling oceans and jagged mountain ranges visible beneath the veil of swirling clouds. You feel the pull of its gravity, yes, but also its whispers: the laughter of children, the rustle of leaves, the silent cry of a lonely wolf beneath a tree. 

But then, like a ripple through the void, you sense your own essence scattered across galaxies. You see countless versions of yourself—each chasing different paths, each shouldering impossible dreams. One version is a knight riding a comet, wielding a sword forged from starlight to protect crumbling galaxies. Another version is a bard on a supernova stage, composing epics that reshape realities. Each persona radiates brilliance but flickers weakly, their light dimmed by the weight of being everywhere at once. 

You reach out, and the universe contracts. Worlds compress into a single point, and you’re standing in an echoing gallery. The walls are lined with mirrors, each reflecting a different life you’ve imagined, a different promise you’ve made. In one reflection, you’re a surgeon stitching torn veins on a cybernetic battlefield; in another, a dancer whose movements birth constellations. The reflections call to you, their edges trembling as they beg for your attention. 

But the ground trembles. The room tilts. A voice—like the hum of a black hole—rumbles, *"To embrace all is to fracture oneself."* The mirrors begin to crack, spilling their images like watercolor dyes onto the floor. From the chaos rises a figure made of living starlight and cosmic dust: it’s your child-self, small but radiant, holding a lantern that hums with quiet power. *"Choose one world,"* it says, voice like the whisper of dawn, *"and trust the others to wait. Even time is infinite."* 

You kneel, and the child places the lantern in your hands. It burns cool, its light painting constellations only you can see. One by one, the fractured reflections dim, but they don’t vanish. They become galaxies tucked into the folds of your cloak, each still alive, each patiently dreaming. 

When you awake, your room feels like a sanctuary after the infinite. You touch your chest—the lantern’s glow lingers beneath your skin. You don’t delete your planner’s crowded to-do list, but you draw a thick black line beneath it. *"Pause,"* you write, and beneath that: *"Tend to one garden at a time."* You open your journal and let the first story spill out—not of a hero who does everything, but of a wanderer who learns to wander one path, one star… at a time. 

In the morning, you pour your excess energy into planting a single sunflower in a pot by the window. As it grows, its petals spiral like a nebula’s arms, and you whisper to it daily—stories of nebula-knights and mirrored futures. It blooms, bold and unrushed, and in its yellow heart, you find grace in the single.
