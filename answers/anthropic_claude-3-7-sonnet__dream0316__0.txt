I am dreaming. I stand in the aisle of a store I've visited hundreds of times, fingers hovering over the familiar packaging that has been a constant companion through college all-nighters, celebrations, and quiet Sunday mornings. The royal blue logo of Celestial Blends coffee—once a beacon of comfort—now seems to mock me with its diminished promise.

The package is different; imperceptibly so to casual shoppers, but I notice everything. The once-rich imagery has been subtly cheapened, the weight feels lighter in my hand, and the price tag makes me wince—$16.99 now for what cost $9.99 just eighteen months ago.

I bring the bag to my nose, a ritual of anticipation I've performed countless times. The aroma that greets me is familiar but hollow, like encountering an old friend who no longer remembers your inside jokes. The complex notes of chocolate and cherry that once danced from these beans have faded into a flat, generic coffee smell.

My mind wanders to last week's disappointment: the watery brew that no technique could salvage, the bitter aftertaste that lingered well past breakfast. I remember how Celestial Blends saw me through my first apartment, how I'd given bags as gifts, evangelizing its perfection to friends who converted to loyal customers themselves.

To my right, competitors beckon with promising marketing and lower prices. To my left, premium alternatives boast of ethical sourcing and innovative roasting techniques. My loyalty card sits heavy in my wallet—just two more stamps until a free bag.

I'm frozen between nostalgia and pragmatism, between the comfort of the known and the potential of something new, between who I was and who I'm becoming.
