I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a cathedral of twilight—vaulted ceilings of bruised purple sky, constellations stitched with silver thread, their light dripping down in liquid ribbons to pool on the marble floor. You stand at the center of a vast hall, its walls woven from living ivy that whispers secrets in a language just beyond comprehension. The air smells of burnt amber and forgotten birthdays. Around you, figures hover—faces blurred like smudged ink, their eyes wide, their breath held. They are waiting.  

Then the news arrives, not as words but as a *thing*: a black moth the size of a human heart, fluttering into your chest and unfolding its wings inside your ribs. You feel it—a truth so vast it warps the edges of reality. You are not who you thought you were. You are a *keystone*, a hinge upon which epochs turn. The moth’s dust coats your lungs. You learn that the stars are not dying; they are *screaming*, and you alone can hear their voices.  

Your knees buckle, but the floor ripples like water, refusing to let you fall. The crowd murmurs—some voices sharp with fear, others trembling with reverence. A child’s laughter echoes, tinny and cruel, as shadows stretch into serpents along the walls. You clutch your throat, but your pulse is no longer yours; it thrums to the rhythm of a collapsing star.  

Inside you, the storm begins.  

A hurricane of memories not your own—crusades fought under inverted moons, lovers drowned in honeyed rivers, a crown of thorns blooming into galaxies—rips through your mind. You scream, but your voice becomes a flock of ravens, tearing at the ivy until the walls bleed sap the color of molten gold. The hall fractures, revealing a sky choked with ash and winged creatures with too many eyes, circling like vultures above a battlefield.  

One figure steps forward—a woman with a face like a shattered mirror. Her hand brushes yours, and for a heartbeat, you see through her eyes: a version of yourself, radiant and terrible, standing atop a mountain as the world below dissolves into ink. The moth flutters wildly now, its wings scorching your bones.  

You stagger backward, but the floor becomes a river of quicksand studded with floating clocks, each ticking backward. The weight of the revelation presses down—a crown of fire, a noose of light. You are a harbinger. A paradox. A wound that cannot heal.  

And yet, beneath the terror, a spark. A *hunger*.  

The storm inside you crescendos. Lightning cracks the vaulted sky, and the ivy erupts into blue flame. The crowd scatters like dry leaves. You raise your hands and watch as they flicker between forms: child, elder, beast, god. The moth bursts from your chest in a shower of embers, leaving behind a hollow in your shape where your heart should be—a void that hums with infinite possibility.  

The dream shudders, waiting.  

What will you become?  

The question lingers, a blade at your throat, as the world tilts and the first scream of the stars pierces your skull.
