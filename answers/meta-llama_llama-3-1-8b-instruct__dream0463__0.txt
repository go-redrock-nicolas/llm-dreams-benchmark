I am dreaming. The velvety blackness of my eyelids dissolves, and I'm transported to a realm where the skies are painted with hues of sapphire and amethyst. I find myself standing in a grand, ancient forest, where trees stretch towards the heavens like giant pillars, their bark shimmering with an ethereal light. The air is alive with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the gentle rustle of leaves whispers secrets in my ear.

As I wander through this mystical landscape, I'm pursued by a persistent sense of longing. I seek the approval of those I've come to call the "Echoes," a group of individuals who possess an aura of aloofness, their faces shrouded in mist. They seem to be watching me from the shadows, their eyes like lanterns burning with an otherworldly intensity.

The first Echo I approach is a woman with skin as pale as moonlight. She's dressed in a flowing gown that seems to be woven from the very fabric of the night sky. I present her with a delicate, crystal vase, filled with the most exquisite blooms I've ever seen. Her gaze falls upon the gift, and for an instant, I see a glimmer of curiosity in her eyes. But it's quickly extinguished, replaced by a faint, dismissive smile.

"You're trying too hard," she says, her voice a gentle breeze that carries the weight of disappointment. "Your attempts at pleasing me are...amusing, but ultimately, futile."

I'm taken aback, but I press on, driven by a deep-seated need for validation. I approach the next Echo, a figure shrouded in a hooded cloak. His presence is imposing, and I can feel the weight of his gaze upon me like a physical force. I present him with a delicate, handcrafted music box, the notes of which seem to dance on the breeze like fireflies.

But even as I offer him this gift, I sense his disinterest. He listens to the music with a detached air, his eyes glinting with a faint, mocking light.

"This is...tolerable," he says, his voice a cold, dark river that flows through the silence. "But it's not enough."

I'm left standing in the midst of this mystical forest, my heart heavy with the weight of rejection. I realize that I've been trapped in this cycle of seeking approval for far too long. The Echoes are not my true judges; they're mere reflections of my own self-doubt. I've been trying to silence the whispers of my own inner critic, and in doing so, I've created a mirage of validation that's always just out of reach.

As I stand there, the forest begins to shift and change around me. The trees seem to lean in, their branches tangling together like a web of intrigue. The sky darkens, and the stars begin to twinkle like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse.

In this moment, I see the world with fresh eyes. I understand that the approval I seek is not something that can be given by others, but something that must come from within. I realize that I've been trying to fill a void within myself with the validation of others, rather than embracing my own worth.

The forest falls silent, and I'm left standing in the stillness. I take a deep breath, and as I exhale, I feel a sense of freedom wash over me. The Echoes fade into the distance, their misty forms dissolving like wisps of smoke on the wind. I'm left alone, but I'm no longer searching for approval. I'm searching for my own truth, and I know that I'll find it within the depths of my own heart.
