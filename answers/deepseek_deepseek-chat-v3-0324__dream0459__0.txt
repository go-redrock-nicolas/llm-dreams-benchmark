I am dreaming. At first, the dream is a soft haze, like morning fog over a river. Colors bleed slowly into existence—muted greens, deep purples, smoldering gold at the edges. I am myself, and yet I am not. My shape flickers as if seen through old film, warping slightly with each step I take.  

Then, she appears—the first version of "who I am with her." My childhood friend, radiant and unchanged by time. The air around us buzzes with an easy warmth, and suddenly *I* am different too: lighter, quicker to laugh, my footsteps bouncing as if the ground has a hidden spring beneath it. The sky shifts to a lazy blue, and the scent of honeysuckle drifts past. I realize—*this is the me that exists only when she is near.* The one who remembers climbing trees, whispering secrets, believing in magic without hesitation.  

A turn of my head—and she’s gone.  

Now, I’m standing before a tall figure cloaked in shadow, their features indistinct but their presence heavy, like the air before a storm. My posture stiffens; my voice takes on a careful, measured tone. This is the me that learned caution, the one who fits into the hollow space *they* leave for me. The dream darkens at the edges, and for a moment, I forget my own name.  

But then—movement. A burst of wild laughter, and I’m running alongside someone whose face I can’t see, but my chest burns with exhilaration. The wind carries my breath away as I become the reckless, joyful creature they pull out of me. The landscape morphs into an endless field of silver grass, each blade singing as we rush through it. *This is the version of me only they know.*  

One by one, the faces shift—the stern teacher who makes my voice small, the lover who draws out a tenderness I didn’t know I had, the stranger who lets me invent myself entirely. With each encounter, my reflection splinters, each shard a different hue, a different weight, a different truth.  

And then, just as I reach for the center of it all—the place where all these selves might fuse—I wake.  

The dream lingers, though. The question, thick as honey: *Which one is really me?* Or perhaps the answer is in the shifting, the becoming, the way we are never just one thing—but many, endless, alive in the spaces between people.
