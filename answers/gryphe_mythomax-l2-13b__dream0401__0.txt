I am dreaming. The sky above me is a deep shade of midnight blue, dotted with twinkling stars. I am standing on a deserted beach, feeling the cool sand beneath my feet as the warm ocean waves lap at the shore. The moon casts a serene glow over the scene, making everything appear ethereal and peaceful. 

As I close my eyes and take in the tranquility, I become aware of an internal voice that is anything but tranquil. It is my self-critical mind, picking apart every little flaw in my behavior and appearance. It's like an insatiable monster, constantly demanding perfection from me and relishing in my every mistake. 

Suddenly, the voice grows louder and more intense. I can feel its venomous words washing over me, making me feel small and worthless. I try to ignore it, to focus on the beautiful surroundings, but it's impossible. The voice becomes so loud that it eclipses everything else, drowning out the sound of the waves and the wind. 

Feeling overwhelmed, I turn towards the ocean and scream out in frustration. My voice echoes through the night, mirroring the pain deep within me. Suddenly, a large wave crashes against the shore, sending water splashing up onto my feet. 

I open my eyes and see that I'm no longer alone. Standing before me is a majestic creature, part-horse and part-dragon. It glares at me with kind yet stern eyes, as if it can sense my inner turmoil. Without a word, it steps towards me and nudges me gently with its head. 

I'm surprised by its gesture but summon the courage to stroke its mane. As my hand comes into contact with its skin, I'm overcome by a sense of peace and calm. The creature lowers its head, encouraging me to climb onto its back. I do so hesitantly, unsure of what to expect. 

To my surprise, the ride is smooth and effortless. The creature runs along the shore, its powerful legs carrying us both effortlessly. The wind whips through my hair, cooling my skin and clearing my mind. For the first time in a long while, I feelWeightless and free. 

After what seems like an eternity, the creature stops and turns towards me. "You are your own worst critic," it says in a booming, yet gentle voice. "Release the negativity and embrace your true self." Its words resonate deep within me, and I know that I can no longer ignore them. 

 slowwwwwwly opening my eyes, I find myself lying in bed, the dream fading from memory. But the message remains. I vow to work on silencing the critical voice within me and to treat myself with the kindness and understanding I deserve.
