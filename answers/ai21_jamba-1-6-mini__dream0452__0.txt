I am dreaming.

I stand beneath the waning moon, its soft glow casting shadows on the stone walls of the ancient city that surrounds me. The air is crisp, with a faint chill that makes me shiver as I turn my face to the stars. They are brighter than I remember, countless diamonds strewn across the endless black canopy.

Around me are the remnants of a world we once knew, now transformed into something surreal and haunting. The streets are paved with the faces of my loved ones, their expressions frozen in a mosaic of awe and confusion. They beckon to me, their voices blending into a gentle chorus that guides me forward.

The path beneath my feet shifts and changes with every step. I walk on clouds, feeling the soft weightlessness beneath my soles, and then suddenly, I am climbing over sharp, jagged rocks, their edges cutting into my skin. Each step is a challenge, a test of faith, yet I press on.

Time no longer holds meaning here. Minutes feel like hours, and hours like fleeting seconds. I reach a clearing, a small, circular field amidst the ruins, where a single tree stands. Its branches are bare but glowing, each branch holding an orb of light that pulses with energy.

The tree speaks to me without words. Its silent voice resonates deep within my soul, telling me of the changes within and around me. It tells me of the relationships that have nourished me, and it gently reveals the truth that one has become too heavy a burden.

I understand.

I lay down beneath the glowing tree, my body sinking into the earth, my spirit floating up to the stars. I let the relationship go. I honor its past nourishment but allow it to drift away like a soft whisper carried by a gentle breeze.

In the distance, I hear the faint sound of laughter, a joyous cacophony that blends with the rustling leaves of the tree. My loved ones are laughing with me, their presence wrapped around me like a warm embrace.

I am lighter.

I am free.

The dream fades, and I wake, my heart lighter, my mind clear, and my soul at peace.
