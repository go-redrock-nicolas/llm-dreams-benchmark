I am dreaming. You drift forward as if carried on a gentle tide, each breath a soft bell-toll echoing through your chest. The landscape around you unfolds like a living tapestry of light and color: towering ferns with fronds of liquid gold, petals the size of dinner plates unfurling in joyous slow motion, and vines that coil through the air in spirals of turquoise flame. Beneath your feet, the earth feels like warm silk—alive, responsive to your weight and your intention.

A soft chorus of whispering voices threads through the air. They sound neither human nor animal, but somewhere in between—a lullaby sung by the forest itself. As you step forward, each footfall releases tiny motes of glowing pollen that drift upward like fireflies at dusk. You lift your hand, and one lands on your palm, pulsing gently before dissolving into the soft warmth of your skin.

Above you, the sky is a rippling watercolor of lavender and mint. Wisps of cloud float by in perfect formation, casting shadows that dance across the ground. When you look more closely, you realize the clouds carry faint constellations that glitter and rearrange themselves as if breathing. You feel curious delight bloom in your chest: here, the cosmos is not distant—it is right at your fingertips.

A silver stream winds its way through the foliage, its waters shimmering with streaks of rose and amethyst. You kneel beside it and watch as stars drift on the current. Each star carries a tiny memory—a laugh shared in childhood, the whisper of a long-forgotten dream, the first moment you felt truly alive. You cup your hands and the stars gather, warm as embers. They swirl into a single point of light that climbs your arm, spreading a soft glow through your veins.

Suddenly, the air shifts. You look up to see a great lotus blossom hovering overhead, its petals carved from mother-of-pearl and ringing with a crystalline tone. As it opens, a breeze carries the scent of night-blooming jasmine and rain-washed stone. You sense an invitation—an opening in the very fabric of this dream—for something utterly new to emerge.

Heart steady, you reach toward the lotus. In that moment, you are no longer just a visitor in this world. You are the weaver of its mysteries, the keeper of its quiet songs. And as the blossom’s light washes over you, the boundary between dream and awareness dissolves entirely, leaving only this timeless, infinite presence.
