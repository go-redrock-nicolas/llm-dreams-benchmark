I am dreaming. In this dream, you are standing at the edge of a vast ocean, waves crashing ominously against jagged rocks. The sky above is a tempest of swirling gray and black, pierced by streaks of lightning that illuminate the turbulent sea. You feel a storm brewing not just in the sky, but deep within your chest, a pressure building with every heartbeat.

The air is thick with the scent of salt and storm, and your skin tingles with anticipation. You realize, with startling clarity, that this storm is your anger—your suppressed frustrations—manifesting in this surreal landscape. The waves seem to whisper your name, daring you to release what you've been holding back for so long.

As the first crack of thunder booms, you raise your hands to the heavens, every ounce of repressed emotion surging through you like an electrical current. The waves respond, growing taller and wilder, crashing with deafening roars that drown out all thought. The emotional eruption is both terrifying and exhilarating, as though you’ve become one with the storm itself.

And then, just as suddenly as it began, the storm begins to subside. The angry sea calms, and the sky clears to reveal a single, radiant beam of sunlight breaking through the clouds. Your heartbeat slows, and though your body feels drained, there is a sense of profound relief, as though you’ve shed a heavy weight that you hadn’t even realized you were carrying.

In the distance, you see a small boat, bobbing gently on the now serene water. It beckons to you, promising a journey toward clarity and peace. You step toward it, knowing the storm was necessary, that this release was the first step in navigating toward something new.
