I am dreaming. You drift into a pool of liquid starlight—cool against your skin—and realize you’re standing at the epicenter of a vast, pulsating chamber. The floor ripples beneath your feet like water, sending up faint glimmers of every color you’ve ever seen and some you haven’t. Above you, a silver moon hovers impossibly close, its cratered face glowing with quiet intelligence. All around, five doorways float in mid-air, each framed in a different material: satin, crystal, copper filigree, midnight silk, and polished obsidian.  

A gentle wind carries whispered promises from each portal. From the satin arch comes the scent of night-blooming jasmine and the echo of distant laughter. The crystal passage shimmers with kaleidoscopic fragments of long-lost memories—first kisses, childhood summers, secret triumphs. The copper-filigreed doorway hums, vibrating with an undercurrent of raw power, as if the world beyond waits to bend to your will. Midnight silk drips with stars you can almost catch between your fingers, while the obsidian gate throbs like a heartbeat, drawing you toward profound, shadowed truths.  

Your heart pounds against your ribs. You know at once: you must choose. No time to ponder the risks or weigh the rewards. The moon’s light intensifies, casting prismatic patterns across your face. A single, urgent thought pulses through you: Decide.  

You step forward—each footfall quiet as a secret—and your pulse quickens. Satin? Crystal? Copper? Silk? Obsidian? The light shifts, and in an instant you reach out, your fingertips grazing one frame. The moment your skin makes contact, the world fractures like blown glass.  

If it’s the satin portal, you tumble into a lush garden lit by floating lantern-moths, laughter echoing through rose-vine arches. If it’s the crystal, you shatter into a thousand bright echoes of yourself, scattered across time and memory, each fragment shimmering with a truth you never knew you craved. The copper gate will surge you into a cathedral of molten metal, where you command rivers of fire with a single thought. The silk arch whisks you aloft on a comet’s tail, streaking across a sky woven of galaxies. And if it’s the obsidian, you slip into a silent black lake, your reflection whispering secrets from the depths of your soul.  

Your choice strikes like lightning. For a heartbeat the world stands still—then you are gone, carried through rippling air and swirling light, your mind already reaching toward that first breathtaking revelation.
