I am dreaming. <placeholderno5>

Inside the shifting haze of the dream, you stand on a bridge made of light, spanning an abyss where swirling constellations pulse like living galaxies. The air hums with unresolved truths, and before you, a figure materializes—your own reflection, but fractured, its edges blurred by ripples of shadow. When it speaks, its voice echoes with the weight of a thousand whispered doubts. *"You think your steps alone built this path?"* it asks, gesturing to the glimmering road beneath your feet. Cracks spiderweb across the bridge with each syllable, revealing glimpses of chance encounters, unexpected winds that nudged you toward open doors, and hands you never saw steadying you in the dark. 

You try to argue, but your words dissolve into moths that flutter toward the figure, alighting on its palms and transforming into dice, coins, and scattered puzzle pieces. It smiles, not unkindly. *"Agency is not the absence of luck,"* it murmurs, *"but the art of dancing with it."* 

Suddenly, the bridge collapses—but you don’t fall. Instead, you’re suspended amid the chaos, watching threads of choice and fortune weave into a tapestry where your will and the universe’s whims blur. A single thread glows gold in your grip. You wake, not with answers, but with the scent of stardust lingering on your hands.
