I am dreaming. My consciousness is a kaleidoscope, shifting hues with every breath.  Around me, the air shimmers like liquid starlight, and somewhere in the distance, a dark silhouette emerges.  The figure is not human but something fluid and ancient—a being woven from the shadows between constellations.  Its voice is many voices, each syllable a ripple through time.

*"Ah,"* it humors, *"you see yourself as we see you: not just flesh and bone, but a constellation of encounters.  Each relationship you’ve lived bends your edges like light through prisms."*

My hands pass through its form; it feels like touching the memory of rain against skin.  It gestures vaguely behind me, and the shadows there deepen into a portal that swallows the void.

*"Enter, and see how others wear your face."*

I step through, and the dream lurches into fragments:

---

**Scene 1: A Riverside Garden under Olive Trees**  
The air smells of jasmine and wet earth after a storm. I am older, hands rough with calluses, wearing a cloak of woven ivy. A girl of seven dances beside a silver stream, her laughter a melody. She calls me *Nursema*, and I bend to let her plait wildflowers into my hair. Here, I am earth’s patient listener; my identity is the quiet spaces where she spills secrets about fallen stars.

**Scene 2: A Flaming Coliseum of Glass**  
Soot clings to my throat. I am fire-branded on the back, a rebel in a crowd of chanting faces. Across the arena stands a figure in crimson—a gladiator chanting my name as both curse and prayer. We fight with words sharper than blades; each syllable chips away at my armor of self-righteousness. Here, I am the specter of their wound, the embodiment of a love turned rancid by betrayal. Our duel ends when I carve my heart from my chest and toss it into the crowd, which erupts into applause like a thousand shattered mirrors.

**Scene 3: A Floating City of Mirrors**  
I exist in fragments—dozens of my selves gliding through cubic halls. One version is a king with gilded eyes, another a beggar with riddles etched into her palms. A child made of smoke hugs my leg and giggles. *"You’re all my someones,"* it says, pulling me toward a room where every mirror shows a different family tree. In one reflection, I am mother to six winged wolves. In another, I am the wind that whispers into a prophet’s ear. Here, my identity is a mosaic of "what ifs," each pane holding a different version of belonging.

---

The shadow-being reappears, now wearing my face. *"You are no one fixed star,"* it murmurs, its voice unraveling into fireflies. *"You are the constellation."*

The dream dissolves, leaving me tangled in bedcovers, heart still echoing with the weight and wonder of borrowed identities.\

Let this dream be a pocket universe for you to revisit. Do you dare step through its prismatic gates again?
