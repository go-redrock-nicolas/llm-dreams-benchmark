I am dreaming. The world around me shifts and morphs – the colors swirl, blending into one another in a kaleidoscope of hues. In this dreamscape, I'm faced with an endless sea of faces, each one an echo of myself. Some look haggard, tired, their eyes pleading for relief. Others are filled with a quiet desperation, silently screaming for escape from the throngs of demands that weigh them down.

I see the reflection of my own struggle in their eyes – my lack of boundaries, the endless over-commitment to things that make me lose sight of my own well-being. In this surreal space where reality and dreams intertwine, I understand that change is afoot.

I breathe deeply, feeling the sensation of a cool breeze brushing against my skin, and in an instant, the sea of faces begins to recede. The colors swirl again and form into a landscape adorned with vibrant, lush foliage – a thriving garden, brimming with life and possibility. I am at peace in this place – rejuvenated and empowered.

As the dream resumes its fluid nature, I carry forward the newfound understanding that I must embrace my limitations and create healthier boundaries. With this knowledge, I am ready to face a future less burdened by the chains of over-commitment.
