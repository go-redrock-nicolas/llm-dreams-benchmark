I am dreaming.

The world around me shimmers with an ethereal, silvery light—each edge of reality dissolving and reforming like wisps of morning fog. I float, weightless, through an immense atrium of transparent crystal pillars stretching infinitely in all directions. Every surface reflects fractured echoes of past decisions—ghostly images of myself, confidently striding forward, each reflection caught in its own moment of unshakable certainty.

Yet now, I notice a change, a subtle but undeniable ripple in the architecture of this dreamscape. I am no longer marching with assurance down my chosen path; instead, I find myself drifting from pillar to pillar, pausing before each shimmering reflection, searching their translucent eyes for approval, for a sanctioned nod or a comforting smile. I speak to faceless, shifting silhouettes—councils of strangers, whose voices echo in grand, empty chambers, raining down advice like glittering threads of starlight. It is as if my own inner compass has been unmoored, magnetized by currents outside of myself.

Examining this shift in confidence, I gaze down and notice my feet are no longer touching solid ground. I am suspended over an endless, inky expanse—a sea of possibilities, dark and inviting. My heart pounds softly with longing and uncertainty. Why do I now yearn for external voices to confirm what once sprang so naturally from within? The air tastes of bittersweet nostalgia, tinged with the delicate fear of making a misstep, of choosing wrong before an unseen audience.

As I reach for clarity, the crystal pillars slowly dissolve, transforming into ancient, towering trees whose roots entwine my ankles. The forest ceiling above glows with pulsing constellations, and a gentle wind whispers through the leaves. I close my eyes, feeling that wind moving through me, carrying forgotten fragments of courage. The invisible weight of others’ gazes begins to lift.

In this lucid moment, I realize the validation I seek from others is but a shadow—ephemeral, ever-shifting, impossible to grasp. The dream reminds me: the most luminous guidance comes from the silent, persistent glow kindling deep within. As dawn’s light floods the horizon, I stand tall, preparing to stride forward once more, anchored not in approval, but in self-trust found anew in the deepest recesses of my imagination.
