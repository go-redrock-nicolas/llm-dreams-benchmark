I am dreaming. I find myself standing on a spiraling staircase made of weathered blue glass, each step humming with a barely perceptible frequency. The air shimmers with particles of light that respond to my thoughts, clustering into patterns when I focus. A profound understanding pulses through me—I've discovered how emotions can be translated into a universal language, a revelation that could bridge the divide between all conscious beings.

When I try to speak, my words transform into luminous symbols that hover before me, exquisitely detailed mandalas of meaning. But as others appear on the staircase—shadow-like figures with familiar yet unrecognizable faces—their expressions remain blank.

"Don't you see?" I plead, my urgency causing the symbols to pulse with deep indigo and amber light. "This is how we've always been connected, beneath the words!"

They smile politely, their eyes sliding past my revelation as though it were merely decorative, not transformative. One reaches through a mandala, disrupting its pattern, using it to check their reflection.

The staircase begins to shift beneath us, steps rearranging themselves according to some cosmic architecture. I feel the knowledge slipping away with each new configuration, becoming more abstract, harder to grasp.

In desperation, I begin to dance, my movements creating cascades of harmonic tones that echo through the space. For a moment—just a moment—recognition flickers across one face, then another. But it fades as quickly as it appeared.

The dream-knowledge remains lodged in my heart like a splinter of truth too precious and painful to dislodge, even as it becomes increasingly untranslatable to the waking world.
