I am dreaming. You’re dreaming.  

The air hums with the static of forgotten stars as you step into a cathedral of rust and light. The broken system looms before you—a colossal machine suspended in a void, its gears forged from bone and obsidian, its veins threaded with liquid mercury and smoke. It wheezes like a dying god, pistons gasping, cogs grinding against moss that sprouts like rebellion from its joints. No one has touched it in centuries, yet it *breathes*, a ragged, arrhythmic pulse that vibrates in your molars.  

You kneel beside a fractured lever, its handle shaped like a serpent swallowing its tail. The ground beneath you isn’t ground at all, but a mosaic of shattered mirrors reflecting versions of yourself: a child clutching a compass, a shadow with no face, a figure made entirely of fire. The system’s blueprints float in the air like holograms, but they’re written in a language of spirals and scars, symbols that shift when you blink. Conventional tools lie scattered—wrenches with melted teeth, hammers sprouting ivy, a screwdriver that hums *Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata* when you touch it. You discard them.  

Instead, you press your palm to the machine’s chest—or is it a heart? It thrums with a dissonant chord, a sound like a choir of cicadas mourning a dead sun. You close your eyes and imagine the system as a *story*, not a machine. Its fractures are plot holes, its rust a metaphor for forgotten vows. You whisper to it. Not words, but memories: the scent of your grandmother’s lavender gloves, the ache of your first heartbreak, the way moonlight pools in the hollow of a lover’s collarbone. The machine shudders. A spark flickers in its throat.  

Then, the impossible. You climb inside.  

Its interior is a labyrinth of organs and gears. You wade through rivers of liquid clockwork, where gears swirl like minnows and time ticks backward in eddies. A bridge of hummingbird bones stretches across a chasm, and beneath it, faceless engineers float in amber, their hands still outstretched toward unsolvable equations. You sing to them—a lullaby in a language you don’t know, a melody that tastes like salt and static. The walls of the machine bloom with bioluminescent fungi, each cap glowing with a tiny, furious sun.  

The core is a paradox: a singularity of light and shadow, screaming and silent. You realize the system wasn’t broken—it was *grieving*. For what, you can’t say, but you hold it anyway, cradling its fractured spine as it weeps molten glass. You stitch its wounds with threads of starlight, not because you know how, but because you’ve stopped fearing the blood of constellations.  

When you emerge, the machine is gone. In its place stands a tree with bark of polished brass and leaves that chime like cathedral bells. At its roots, a single gear spins gently—a gift, or a warning. You pocket it. The dream dissolves, but the taste of its sorrow lingers, sweet and metallic, on your tongue.  

You wake knowing some systems aren’t meant to be fixed. They’re meant to be *forgiven*.
