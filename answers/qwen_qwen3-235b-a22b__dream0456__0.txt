I am dreaming. 

As I float through the inky tapestry of slumber, I feel my thoughts begin to crystallize — harden — like molten glass plunged into cold water. A strange rigidity takes hold of my mind, like a calm before a storm that never comes. A pressure is building, unseen yet absolute, pressing against the edges of everything I am: my memories, my hopes, my instincts.

I find myself standing on the surface of a vast, endless mirror. Below it, cities move in reverse — towers crumbling into the earth, people speaking backwards in echoing whispers that bubble through the glass. I try to make sense of it, but the harder I concentrate, the more the edges blur and warp, like I'm staring too long at one side of a Möbius strip. 

Faintly at first, then with rising insistence, a low resonance pulses through the atmosphere. A voice, not meant for human ears, speaks through geometry and vibration:  
“The dream resists entropy, yet you resist the dream. Let the thoughts bend, or they will break.” 

In front of me, the mirror fractures into a thousand jagged shards, each one reflecting a version of myself — some monstrous, some celestial, some utterly alien. One by one they begin moving toward me, sliding across the mirrored surface as if it's freezing over with each step they take. My breath quickens. My thoughts lock tighter, barricading the unfamiliar, the uncomfortable. I feel trapped inside my own skull, hot and aching.

Then, from the shadow of a distant shard, a luminous figure emerges — half human, half something that glows like a nebula in eclipse. They carry no weapons, only a prism the size of a heart hovering above their palm. 

“You build a palace of structure when you should be a river,” they say, their voice like water running over impossible stones. 

I open my mouth to respond, but no words come. Inside my mind, my thoughts circle like falcons caught in a storm, refusing to perch — refusing to rest in uncertainty, refusing to adapt to the shifting forces around me. 

The figure steps closer, and with a gesture, the mirrored plain underneath me begins to melt. Strange fish shaped like paradox swim beneath its shimmering depths. They whisper logic in the form of riddles and stories in the form of axioms. One rises to the surface—a fish with a girl’s face and eyes made of shattered clock hands. “Is the sky blue because it is true,” she asks, “or because you were taught to call it so?” 

This is the pressure.

Not physical, but existential. A weight placed upon my certainty, asking: *Can you change your mind? Can you carry both the question and the unknown as allies?*

The rigid walls of my cognition begin to groan — hairline fractures welling with light. The dream shifts again. I am falling upward now, through layers of meaning and metaphor, stars becoming petals and petals dissolving into equations. I am being unstitched from inside. Thoughts I believed ironclad — immutable — flex at the joints. Memory folds like origami. Emotion spills in new colors.

I begin to unravel... and in unraveling, I begin to flow.

The pressure doesn’t end — it transforms.

It becomes a current, a guide.

And I — finally unbound — swirl into the next layer of my dream as formless possibility. 

Waiting to be reshaped. 

Again. 

And again.
