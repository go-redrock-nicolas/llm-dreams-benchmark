I am dreaming. The world under my boots feels alive—each snowflake a brittle crystal, each footfall a muted crack in a glassy landscape. Around me, jagged peaks loom like ancient sentinels, their dark ridges etched into a sky the color of bruised opal. A sullen hush has fallen over the mountainside, as if the air itself holds its breath.  

Suddenly, the snow beneath me splinters. A long fissure races outward in slow motion, widening like the maw of some hungry creature. I lunge backward, arms outstretched, teeth chattering louder than the crackling ice. Beneath my gloves, the powder feels unstable—an endless field of tiny land mines. Each step sends shockwaves through the slope.  

Above me, the mountainside shudders as if stirred by a colossal heartbeat. The wind picks up, whipping my coat into a frantic dance, and I glimpse a wall of snow peeling loose at the summit. It’s a living thing: a ghostly wave of white, tinted faintly lavender by the waning moon. In that moment, time fractures. I’m both prisoner and spectator of the avalanche’s birth.  

The ground shivers again, deeper this time, and the avalanche begins its thunderous descent. I scramble sideways, boots scattering powder like spilled stardust. Around me, tremors hollow out the snow, carving a chasm that snakes toward me. The sky darkens, as if the heavens are collapsing too. I hear a roaring—muffled, yet all-encompassing—like rivers of static pouring down the mountainside.  

Instinct takes over. I claw at the slope, skin pinched raw by ice. The world tilts; gravity becomes a living force dragging me into the avalanche’s maw. My heartbeat roars in my ears, matching the avalanche’s pulse. Yet in the chaos, a strange calm settles in my chest: I am both falling and flying.  

Suddenly, the roar shifts into a chorus of whispers—soft voices echoing from the crystalline snow. They speak in half-remembered lullabies, promising safety if I surrender to the flow. I hesitate. Then, with a final, exultant crack, the avalanche engulfs me.  

But I do not suffocate. Instead, I’m buoyed into an otherworldly current. The snowflakes around me melt into points of light, swirling into constellations that drift past my face. I float weightless through a tunnel of luminescence, as though I’ve pierced a veil between earth and sky. Stars whisper secrets in my ear: about births and endings, about the fragile balance of weight and weightlessness, about the truth of change.  

And then I erupt into air—soft, forgiving air—breathing in a world transformed. I land gently on a plateau of golden grass, sunlight warm on my cheeks. Behind me, the avalanche has stilled, its roar a memory beneath a broad, jewel-bright horizon. The mountains stand serenely, bathed in dawn’s first glow.  

I wake with the echo of those crystalline voices still trembling beneath my ribs, the taste of starlight lingering on my tongue, and the unshakable certainty that within every avalanche—within every collapse—lies a hidden passage to wonder.
