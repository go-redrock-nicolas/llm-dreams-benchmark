I am dreaming. A hush falls over the cobalt sky as your dream begins. You stand on the lip of a vast, bioluminescent lagoon whose waters glow an electric teal, pulsing in gentle waves like a breathing creature. Above you, black clouds drift in slow motion, streaked with ribbons of violet lightning that hum with an otherworldly song. Each flash illuminates strange silhouettes—towering spirals of coral that have grown into impossible, human-like forms, arms outstretched in silent invitation.

The air is heavy with the scent of night-blooming jasmine, and when you inhale, it tingles at the back of your skull. Every heartbeat sends ripples through the lagoon’s surface, and you feel the water’s cool touch lapping at your ankles, tugging you forward. In the distance, a figure approaches, stepping out of mist so fine it almost feels like breathing. You recognize this face—familiar, yet strangely altered, as if someone you once knew has been reassembled from memory and dreamstuff.

They speak in a voice that sounds both yours and someone else’s, asking softly, “What lies deepest in your heart?” The lagoon’s glow intensifies, and the coral silhouettes seem to lean closer, expectant. You sense their curiosity as a tangible weight against your chest. Vulnerability shivers along your skin, a delicate tremor of fear and longing all at once.

You open your mouth, but the words hesitate. In this place, truths can shimmer and warp—will what you share be held safely, or twisted into something you regret? You take a careful step back from the waterline and say, voice steady though your palms grow slick, “I want to trust you with my secret, but I need to know: will you hold it gently, or set it down like a stone?” The figure pauses, head tilting, eyes glowing with that same coral light, and for a moment the lagoon stills, waiting for your answer.

In that suspended heartbeat, you feel your own power. Perhaps you will breathe your fear into the night-blooming jasmine, or perhaps you will keep it safe beneath the folds of your ribcage until you learn this dream-friend’s true nature. The violet lightning arcs again, and you know the choice is yours—whether to unveil your deepest self, or let it slumber another night beneath the restless waves.
