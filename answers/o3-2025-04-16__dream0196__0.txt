I am dreaming. …step out from the velvet wings and onto a stage vast enough to feel like a continent, yet bright enough to eclipse every memory you’ve ever had of night. Towers of glassy light rise behind the footlights, turning the theater into a living geode whose crystal facets glitter with the breath of thousands. The audience—a kaleidoscope of masked faces, top-hatted parrots, silver-furred wolves in evening dress, clouds wearing monocles—leans forward as though a single, collective heartbeat is pushing them closer.

A stagehand in a tailcoat shaped like raven feathers presses a curious instrument into your palms: half violin, half telescope, with strings spun from moonlight and tuning pegs that look suspiciously like miniature eclipses. You’ve never seen sheet music this elaborate—notes spiral off the staves, pirouette in mid-air, and dissolve into fireflies. Somehow you’re expected to play them.

Your pulse thumps a frantic rhythm, but the orchestra—an assembly of clockwork giraffes wielding brass trombones—has already lifted their bows. The conductor, a levitating dandelion puff in a frock coat, raises a baton fashioned from a shooting star and counts down: four… three… two…

In that instant, dread loosens its grip, replaced by something wilder: the realization that dreams respect desire more than ability. You draw the bow across luminous strings, and instead of a screeching beginner’s note, a comet of sound arcs through the hall—liquid silver, ringing like cathedral bells submerged in the ocean. Gasps ripple across the audience as constellations flare to life above the proscenium, mapping your melody into galaxies.

The instrument reshapes beneath your fingers. The scroll unfurls like a fern, sprouting extra frets whenever your imagination demands an impossible chord. Fingertips remember techniques you never studied; muscle memory is rewritten on the spot by want alone. Each phrase summons visions on stage: a desert of violet sand springs up and whirls into a cyclone; koi fish made of paper lanterns leap from invisible ponds; the theater floor tilts until you and the orchestra balance on the curve of the moon itself.

Sweat turns to stardust on your brow. You angle the telescope-violin skyward, and through its hollow neck you glimpse whole dreamscapes waiting to hatch—forests of mirrors, domino cities, rain that falls upward. A cadenza soars from your soul like a bird discovering wings midflight. The masked crowd rises, their ovation a storm of petals that float around you in slow-motion spirals.

As the final harmonic fades, the curtains draw themselves closed not with ropes, but with sentences: lines of glowing text that stitch together, spelling “WELL DREAMED.” The orchestra bows. The conductor disintegrates into a puff of seeds, drifting away on an unfelt breeze. You exhale, and the backstage corridor appears—an avenue of doors painted with sunsets, each knob an invitation.

Before choosing one, you look back. The stage remains lit, waiting—for another impossible performance, or perhaps for someone else’s night-bound courage. And in the hush after applause, you understand: you never replaced the virtuoso. You became the dream’s own idea of mastery, just for the span of a single breath.

You step through the nearest sunset door, feeling the weight of that impossible instrument vanish like dew, and fall awake—heart racing, ears still ringing with the laughter of constellations that you, somehow, played into being.
