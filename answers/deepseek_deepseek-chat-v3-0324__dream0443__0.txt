I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and distant lightning, the kind that crackles just beyond your peripheral vision. You stand in a vast, glass-walled gallery, though there are no doors—only mirrors stretching into infinity, each reflecting a fractured piece of you. A voice, sonorous and echoing, drifts through the space like a current of wind.  

*"You are resisting."*  

Your fists clench at your sides. The words, whatever they were meant to be—guidance, critique, revelation—feel like accusations. The mirrors quiver, warping your reflection into something jagged, armored. A knight. A fortress. A creature all edges.  

Then, the floor liquefies beneath your feet, pulling you under into a river of ink. You kick, thrash, but the current is relentless, dragging you deeper until—  

Silence.  

You are floating now, suspended in liquid shadow. Below you, glowing fissures split the darkness like veins of molten gold. The voice returns, softer now, wrapping around you like a current:  

*"What are you protecting?"*  

You want to lash out again, but here, in the quiet deep, your heartbeat is the only sound. And then you see it—the thing nestled in your ribs, pulsing like a second heart. A pearl. No—a cocoon. Inside, something trembles. Waiting.  

A choice blooms before you: clutch it tighter, or let the water pry your fingers open.  

What do you do?
