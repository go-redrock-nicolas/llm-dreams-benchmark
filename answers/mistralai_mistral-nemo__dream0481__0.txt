I am dreaming. I am floating in the vast, inky expanse of outer space, tethered to the gentle hand of the cosmos, gently drifting along a currant of stardust. The void is a symphony of hues, an artist's palette come to life: purples and blues so deep they seem to sing, splashed with fiery oranges and yellows where suns burn fiercely, all surrounded by the calligraphy of distant galaxies, their celestial bodies whispering secrets in the language of light.

I am drawn to the musical hum of comets, streaking across the night like prima donnas in the grand cosmic finale. Their tails, frozen refreshments on this steaming celestial stage, stretch out in symmetrical elegance, each one a tale of nuclear fusion and gravity's dance. The largest one, a icy monarch, pirouettes elegantly around me, its frozen heart glinting like a diamond under the cruel gaze of nearby suns.

Attracted by the hum of cosmic radio waves, I near a binary star system, close enough to feel the heat of their celestial embrace. The smaller star, a cohesive ball of fire, waltzes around its larger companion, the latter an aging red giant, its bloated form swelling with the desperation of an actor reaching for his final curtain call. I watch, captivated, as their gravitational embrace throws off waves of color, a cosmic fireworks display that sets my heart aflutter.

But my interest is not in the spectacle, but the smaller, seemingly unimportant details. I'm drawn to the detritus of the cosmos, the interstellar dust and discarded remnants that most ignore. Amidst the galaxies, I find a fragments of glass, ethereal and crystalline, drifting alone, unsung heroes of the universe. They catch the starlight, bending it in refracted ways, creating tiny universes of light and color nebulae within their tiny structures. I collect them, cradling them in my astral hands, each one a testament to the universe's boundless creativity.

Suddenly, I hear a soft, rhythmic pulsing, a melody as ancient as the cosmos itself. I follow the sound, letting it guide me through asteroid belts and nebulae, until I reach a lonely asteroid, pocked and worn by eons of cosmic travel. To my astonishment, it's humming, pulsating with life. A tiny, glowing organism sits on its surface, a cosmic refugee perhaps, using the asteroid as a shell, creating its own universe, its own music. Its hum is a symphony, a cosmic composition played on the violin of gravity, the piano of pulsars, the drum of black holes.

In the grand dance of the cosmos, this little creature, this fragment of glass, these seemingly insignificant details, are what draw me in. I am not a grand explorer of galaxies, but a collector of cosmic ephemera, finding beauty in what others overlook, drawn to the universe's quiet symphony, even when the cosmos belts out its grand finale.
