I am dreaming. Drift into a world of swirling colors and undefined shapes. Suddenly, everything snaps into focus and I find myself standing in a grand, opulent reception hall. The walls are lined with floor-to-ceiling mirrors, reflecting an endless vista of the room. Ornate candelabras cast flickering shadows on the tile floor, creating a dancing, hypnotic pattern.

Across the room, a figure sits in a plush velvet armchair, legs crossed, brows furrowed. It's my best friend, Samantha. She's frowning at me, arms crossed tightly across her chest. An uncomfortable heaviness settles in my gut as I realize we're about to have an intense disagreement.

"Don't you think you're being a bit rash about this?" I ask, my voice echoing slightly in the spacious room.

Samantha scoffs, shaking her head. "Honestly, I can't believe you're so careless with your career. You've worked so hard to get to this point, and you're just going to throw it all away?"

The conversation begins to escalate. Samantha's words sting, partially because she's expressing concerns similar to my own fears, but also because of the way she's delivering them. Her voice grows louder, more strident. The mirrors reflect our growing agitation - in some pockets, I can see matching scowls on our faces, arms gesticulating wildly. 

I want to end the argument, but an insistent little voice in the back of my mind pushes me to be heard as well. We march back and forth like soldiers preparing for battle, hurling accusations and building defenses. It feels like a long, drawn out power struggle.

With a suddenness that takes me by surprise, I feel myself gradually disconnecting from the argument. My body fades to transparency, the scene muting as I lift up above the room. I watch the two versions of us carry on, tilling the same argument without resolution or growth.

Then, I'm enveloped in a dense, milky fog. It muffles sound in a marshmallowy way and drains the argument's intensity. The fog shoots to the side, out of my field of vision, and the room flicks back into focus. Samantha's still in her seat, now looking at me with compassion and concern in her eyes.

"We can't keep doing this," I say, "not without change and understanding from both of us."

She reaches for my hand. "You're right. I'm sorry for being so harsh."

I squeeze her fingers. The scene shifts and we're standing in a beautiful meadow, the sun warming our upturned faces, our feet bare in the cool grass.

Just like that, the dream fades to a gentle, hopeful hum.
