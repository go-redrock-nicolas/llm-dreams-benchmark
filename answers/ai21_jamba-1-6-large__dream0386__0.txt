I am dreaming. This dream begins abruptly, as I am standing on the edge of a dark forest. The trees are tall and thin, with black bark and leaves that shimmer like silver in the faint light of a crescent moon. The air smells of rich earth and something faintly metallic, like blood. I feel no fear, only a strange curiosity pulling me forward into the woods. My feet move of their own accord, carrying me deeper into the unknown.

As I walk, the trees begin to whisper. At first, the sounds are faint—a soft rustling, almost like wind through leaves—but then, they grow louder. The whispers sound almost like voices, speaking in a language I don’t understand. I try to make sense of the words, but the more I focus, the harder it becomes to hear anything distinct. The whispers seem to grow louder still, now accompanied by faint, incomprehensible murmurs that seem to come from all around me.

Suddenly, I hear a voice—one that stands out from the dissonant chatter. It’s soft and low, but there’s an edge of urgency to it. I turn, searching for the source, and I see her.

She’s standing just a few feet away, a pale figure in the semidarkness, and I can feel her gaze on me. Her hair is long and wild, dark and tangled as though it has been caught in the branches of the forest. She wears a dress that looks like it was once white, but now it’s stained and torn, covered in dirt and leaves. The visible parts of her skin are smudged with mud, and there are streaks of some dark, greasy substance running down her arms and face. Her eyes, though, are what hold my attention—deep and black, they seem to shine with a light all their own, as if she sees things I’m not meant to understand.

She steps toward me, her movements graceful but unnervingly quick. The whispers intensify as she approaches. My skin prickles with a sense of dread, but there is a strange calm within me. In that moment, I’m aware that I’m standing on the edge of something dangerous, something that could consume me entirely, but I don’t run.

She speaks, and her voice is at once beautiful and terrifying. “You’ve come this far,” she says. “Do you know what you’re looking for?”

I don’t answer, although I feel like I should. She steps closer still, until I can feel the cold emanating from her body.

“You’re close,” she says. “But are you ready for what’s waiting?”

Her voice seems to echo in my mind long after she has finished speaking. A chill runs down my spine, but I can’t move. Her words—or perhaps her presence—hold me in place. She tilts her head, studying me with those dark, bottomless eyes, and I know, without a doubt, that she sees something in me that I don’t yet understand.

“Are you willing to give up everything?” she asks.

Her voice is soft, almost tender, but the question carries a weight that makes me hesitate. What is she asking of me? What could I possibly give up? My fears, my desires? My very sense of self?

Before I can find the answer, the forest around me begins to change. The trees seem to stretch upward, becoming impossibly tall, the canopy so thick that no light penetrates it. The air thickens, becoming heavy, suffocating. I look behind me, seeking the path I came from, but it’s gone. I’m surrounded by darkness, the forest closing in on all sides, and there is no escape.

Then, the pale woman steps toward me again, closer this time, her face coming into sharper focus. Her lips are moving, forming words I can’t hear, but the whispers in the background are clearer now, more urgent. I hear faint cries, distant screams. My head pounds, my chest tightens. It’s as though the forest itself is alive, breathing around me, its branches reaching out to grab me.

“What are you doing here?” Her voice has changed—it’s sharper now, more urgent. “What do you want?”

I try to speak, but my mouth is dry, my tongue heavy. I feel as though I’m choking, drowning in the overwhelming closeness of her, the forest, and whatever is moving just beyond the veil of my perception.

And then, just as suddenly as it began, the dream fades. I’m left in darkness, falling, endlessly, into the void.
