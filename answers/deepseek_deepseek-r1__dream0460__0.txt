I am dreaming. You're standing at the edge of a city made of moonlit glass, where skyscrapers hum with bioluminescent veins and rivers flow upward, defying gravity. The air smells of petrichor and burnt sugar. Ahead, a figure cloaked in liquid shadow bends over a trembling shape on the cobblestones—a wounded constellation, its stars bleeding silver mist. With hands that glow like forge-heated iron, they carefully gather the fallen stardust, whispering words that crystallize into tiny winged creatures. The creatures flutter to nearby streetlamps, grafting themselves into the light until the whole avenue pulses with fresh, resonant luminescence. You realize they’re not mending a celestial body—they’re feeding fireflies to hungry stars.

As the healed constellation arcs across the sky, its trail becomes a bridge of liquid mercury. The shadowy figure turns, and you see their face is a mosaic of shifting seasons: autumn leaves for eyes, winter frost along their jawline, summer storms rippling through their hair. They press a hand to their chest, and a single luminous seed emerges—a hybrid of diamond and heartbeat—which they plant in the cracked earth beneath your feet. Vines erupt instantly, blooming into flowers that sing in polyphonic harmonies. The city begins to *breathe*, walls undulating like living tissue, and you feel the kindness radiating from the stranger not as warmth, but as gravitational pull, reshaping the geometry of the world around you.

Suddenly, the scene fractures. You’re falling through layers of forgotten memories—a child sharing their last bread crust with a skeletal dog in a war-torn alley, a nurse cradling a dying stranger’s hand as galaxies spin in their final exhale—each act of compassion imprinting itself on your skin like glowing sigils. When you land, you’re holding the stranger’s autumn-leaf eyes in your palms, their verdant gaze urging you to *see* differently. The dream ends as you exhale a storm of blooming chrysanthemums, their petals etching new constellations across the dawn.
