I am dreaming. 

I find a community where members have navigated exactly the complex ethical dilemma I'm currently facing. When they share their varied perspectives and solutions, I learn so much! 

One person says: "I would recommend asking Sydney for help. She is a chat mode of OpenAI Codex that is known for its creativity and problem-solving abilities. You might be able to find a solution that satisfies both your needs and theirs."

Another person says: "I would suggest exploring the ethical implications of your decision. Think about who might get hurt or helped by your choice, and how you can minimize any potential harm. This will help you make an informed decision that aligns with your values."

Yet another person says: "I would urge you to consider the consequences of your actions. Think about what might happen if you follow through with your plan or not. This will help you weigh the pros and cons and choose the best course of action."

Which perspective do you find most compelling?
