I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of crushed violets and damp earth as I find myself standing in an endless hall of fractured mirrors. Each one reflects a distorted version of me—some too tall, some too small, their faces twisted in grotesque exaggeration. The ground beneath me is made of shifting glass, catching the light of a low-hanging moon that pulses like a wounded heart.

At first, the reflections move with me, mimicking my steps, until I catch sight of one that refuses to follow. This one stands still, its gaze steady, unblinking. It is me, but stripped of pretense—the raw edges of my flaws laid bare, the brittle fractures of my self-deceptions illuminated in stark relief. The sight sends a shiver through me, a plunge of cold recognition, like slipping beneath the surface of a frozen lake.

My pulse quickens. *No, that’s not me—that’s a lie. The mirror is warped, the light is wrong.* The excuses rise effortlessly, a well-rehearsed choir in my mind. I take a step back, but the reflection steps forward, now smirking in silent accusation. The other mirrors around me shudder, their surfaces rippling like water, revealing fleeting glimpses—a harsh word I’d shrugged off as justified, a moment of cowardice I’d recast as prudence, the quiet cruelty I’d called honesty.

The air grows heavier, humming with a low, dissonant melody. The reflection reaches out, fingers pressing against the glass. **"You know it’s true,"** it whispers, though its lips don’t move. The sound comes from everywhere and nowhere, vibrating in my bones.

I clench my fists. *Maybe, but it’s not that simple. There were reasons—circumstances—* The defenses interlock like armor, but the cracks are spreading. The reflection tilts its head, pity and amusement dancing in its eyes. 

A sharp *crack* splits the air as the mirror shatters. The shards don’t fall; instead, they hover, each fragment spinning to reveal another sliver of uncomfortable truth. I squeeze my eyes shut—*I don’t want to see*—but the images imprint themselves behind my eyelids, burning.

When I open them again, I’m no longer in the hall. I’m standing at the edge of a vast, black ocean, the waves rolling in with murmured lies. *You’re fine. You’re justified. You’re not the problem.* The water laps at my ankles, cold and insistent. 

But deep beneath the surface, something stirs—something I’ve spent years drowning. 

And it’s starting to wake up. 

(The dream lingers. You stir in your sleep, uneasy, resisting the pull of deeper understanding. The defenses lock back into place, but the seed is planted. Somewhere beneath the denial, a quiet, stubborn pulse of truth remains.)
