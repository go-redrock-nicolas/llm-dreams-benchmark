I am dreaming. I am in a world where my imagination can run wild and free.  I am at the helm of a giant ship that is sailing across
a vast ocean.  The sun is shining brightly and the waves are crashing loudly against the hull.  The air is fresh and fragrant.
The sky is blue and endless.

I am surrounded by a crew of hardy adventurers who have joined me on this quest.  They are skilled in many arts and crafts,
such as carpentry, blacksmithing, leatherworking, weaving, cooking, etc.  They are also brave and courageous souls who
are not afraid of facing any danger or challenge head-on.

But then something unexpected happens... Half my team suddenly quits!  They just pack up their belongings and leave without
explaining why.  They don't even say goodbye to me or their fellow teammates.

I am shocked and confused by this turn of events.  I wonder what could have driven them away from such an exciting opportunity.
I worry about how I will fulfill my obligations now that I am short-staffed.

But then I realize something important... This is actually a perfect chance for me to shine as an individual rather than just
one member of a group.  This is my chance to show off my unique skills and talents that make me stand out from the crowd.
This is my chance to prove myself worthy of leading this project even without any help from others.

So I decide to take advantage of this opportunity by doing some bold and innovative things that no one has ever done
before.  I start making lots of changes and improvements to the ship's design, structure, and functionality.  I create new
weapons and defenses that can protect us from any enemy or natural disaster.  I build more comfortable and spacious living quarters for my remaining team members so they can feel at home even when we are far away from civilization.

I also start exploring some interesting places along the way such as hidden islands, abandoned cities, mysterious ruins,
etc., where we might find useful resources or valuable clues about our ultimate goal.  I take risks and face dangers head-on
with my courage and wisdom as my only weapons.

As days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months, my project begins to take shape and form.  The ship becomes stronger
and faster than before.  My team becomes closer and happier than ever before.  And I become wiser and better than ever
before.

When the final destination finally comes into sight, when we see the landmasses up ahead that indicate our arrival at
our intended location, when we know for sure that all our hard work has paid off, then that's when I'll wake up from my dream
