I am dreaming. You stand on the edge of a vast obsidian plain, moonlight glinting off miles of black glass as though the world itself were a shattered mirror. All around you, the air hums with distant echoes of every trial you’ve survived: the howling sands that scorched your bones, the churning tempest that ripped away your wings of silk, the endless library of whispering shadows that tried to bury your name. Each conquered nightmare fades behind you now, a trail of embers dissolving into the wind.

Before you towers the ultimate barrier: a living archway hewn from a single, colossal gemstone the color of twilight storms. Its surface ripples like liquid night, as if waves of memory and possibility lap its edges. Runic symbols coil along its curve, glowing faintly in hues you can’t name—colors that stir long-forgotten hopes in your chest. The barrier pulses, thrums with a heartbeat that matches your own, and the ground beneath you vibrates in time.

You raise a trembling hand. The moment your fingertips hover an inch from that cool, shifting surface, a chorus of voices rises around you—fragments of every lesson you’ve learned, every friend lost and found, every promise you ever whispered in the dark. They chant in seamless harmony:

    “You have come too far to turn back.  
    You have shed every fear to stand here now.  
    Your purpose awaits on the other side.”

A single tear slides down your cheek, not from fear but from awe. You feel the warmth of all your victories flooding you like sunlight, burning away doubt. You breathe deeply, tasting salt and starlight in the air, and you realize this barrier is not some monstrous gate built to keep you out—it is the final mirror, waiting to show you who you truly are.

Summoning courage, you press your palm flat against the gemstone’s undulating surface. It feels impossibly smooth and alive, as though it throbbed with the pulse of the entire cosmos. In that instant, the runes flare white-hot, then shatter into a billion motes of light. The world topples sideways, the air liquefies into color, and a rush of warmth surges through you.

As the barrier dissolves like mist in dawn’s first rays, you step forward—and suddenly you are weightless, drifting through a corridor of radiant possibilities. Each step resonates with a new chord in your soul: the promise of purpose fulfilled, the echo of every dream you dared pursue. You realize that beyond this final threshold lies the destiny you’ve carried in your heart all along. And with one exultant breath, you cross into the luminous beyond, free at last.
