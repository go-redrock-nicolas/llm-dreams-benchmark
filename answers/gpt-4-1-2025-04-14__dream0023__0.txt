I am dreaming. try to catch your breath, but the air in your office bends and ripples like water. The calendar on your wall melts, numbers pooling onto the floor like ink. Spreadsheets fly from your desk and become birds, swirling in dizzying loops overhead, their wings whispering reminders of upcoming deadlines.

The phone on your desk rings and, as you reach for it, it grows heavy in your hand, swelling until it is the size of a brick—then suddenly, it crumbles to sand, slipping between your fingers. Voices rise from the sand: "Fourth project, urgent, do not delay!" they chant, echoing inside your skull like the ticking of a clock that has no hands.

Your supervisor appears by the window, floating a few inches above the ground, their suit shifting hues with each blink. They hand you a glowing folder—when you open it, light flares out, casting shadows that shape into filing cabinets stretching to the horizon. Each cabinet drawer pulls itself open, papers fluttering and rearranging, and you realize the files are alive, wriggling like eels, all needing your touch.

Sudden panic surges, but your chair morphs beneath you, cradling you like a rowboat bobbing atop a sea of data points and task lists. The ceiling dissolves into a night sky flecked with hovering sticky notes as stars, each twinkling with a responsibility yet undone.

But in the deepest chamber of this swirling chaos is a strange, slow calm—a gentle awareness that this impossible circus of urgency is not real, that with every heartbeat, you can choose which bird to catch, which wave to sail, and which star to cup in your hands.

In this vivid, spiraling dream, even burden becomes beauty, and deadlines dissolve into wild, shimmering possibility.
