I am dreaming. Wait—no, I *am* the dream.  

The air hums with the scent of ozone and hot metal, thick with the tension of a thousand unsaid warnings. Above us, the sky is not blue but a shifting tapestry of liquid mercury, reflecting the skeletal outline of the structure we’re building—a bridge, a tower, a *threshold*—its purpose just beyond my grasp, but I *know* it is vital. The girders gleam like polished bone, each bolt a heartbeat, each weld a whispered promise.  

Then I see it—the team, my team, their faces blurred as if seen through warped glass, their hands moving too quickly, their tools biting into steel with reckless haste. One of them—a figure with no distinct features, only a shadow where a face should be—adjusts a beam by eye instead of calibration. The spirit level lies abandoned, its bubble trembling off-center. My breath catches.  

"Stop," I say, but my voice is swallowed by a sudden wind carrying the sound of distant, discordant bells. The structure groans. A hairline fracture races up a support column, branching like lightning. I lunge forward, but the ground beneath me is no longer solid—it ripples, viscous, pulling at my boots. The workers don’t notice. They never do in dreams.  

Then the first bolt shears. A scream of metal. The fracture widens, and through it, I see—  

—*not the ground below, but an endless fall through stars, through time, through the hollow eyes of those who trusted us to build it right*—  

I wake with the taste of iron on my tongue, the phantom sound of collapsing geometry ringing in my ears. The dream clings, sticky as oil. It was never just a structure.  

It was a *cage for something*. And now it’s loose.
