I am dreaming. The landscape around me shifts like watercolors bleeding into one another, a swirling kaleidoscope of blues and purples that pulse with a soft, internal light. Before me stands a figure, their form indistinct yet undeniably radiating waves of profound sorrow. Tears, like liquid moonlight, trace shimmering paths down their face, their shoulders trembling with the weight of an unseen burden. Their cries are not sounds, but rather tangible vibrations in the dream-air, heavy and thick with despair. I can *feel* the raw anguish emanating from them, a palpable force that should, by all rights, stir something within me.

Yet, I remain utterly still, an impassive observer. It's as if I'm watching a play unfold behind a thick pane of glass. The character's grief is visually apparent, theatrically dramatic even, but the emotional resonance, the echo of shared humanity that usually connects us, is conspicuously absent. There's no twinge of sympathy in my chest, no empathetic tightening of my throat, no urge to reach out and offer solace. It's a void, a chilling emptiness where compassion ought to reside.

I try to summon the expected response, to consciously *feel* something for this weeping specter. I focus on their trembling form, the shimmering tears, the palpable waves of sadness rolling off them. I dredge through my own memories of pain, hoping to find a relatable spark. But nothing ignites. It's like trying to strike a match in a vacuum. The connection is simply not there.

The realization dawns slowly, chillingly. This isn't mere detachment; it's a profound *lack*. The emotional circuits are dead. The empathy I usually possess, the very thing that allows me to connect with others, has evaporated like morning mist under a harsh sun. I am a spectator to suffering, incapable of participating even on an emotional level.

A strange sense of unease begins to creep in, not born of empathy for the figure, but of a disconcerting awareness of my own internal state. It's a cold, analytical observation. Why am I like this? What part of me is missing or broken? The dream-logic offers no answers, only amplifies the unsettling feeling of being fundamentally disconnected, an island adrift in an ocean of another's tears, utterly unmoved by the storm. The vibrant, shifting colors of the dreamscape suddenly seem mocking, their beauty highlighting the stark ugliness of my own emotional barrenness. I watch the figure continue to weep, a silent, hollow observer in a world brimming with an emotion I cannot touch.
