I am dreaming. ...drifting...yes, I am dreaming.

The air hums with an expectant energy, thick and sweet like honeyed wine. I find myself standing, yet strangely weightless, within an immense amphitheater carved from iridescent crystal. Prismatic light fractures across impossibly smooth surfaces, refracting the 'audience' – not people, but towering, silent sunflowers, their vast, dark centers fixed unwaveringly on the stage. The stage itself isn't solid but a shimmering disc of captured moonlight, floating gently above a pool of swirling nebula gas.

There, bathed in the moon-disc's ethereal glow, stands Marcus. In the waking world, he's my colleague, but here his features seem sharper, almost sculpted from alabaster, his suit woven from threads of pure starlight. He holds aloft a structure of intricate, clockwork design – a heart made of gears and spun-glass tubing, emitting a soft, rhythmic golden light. It pulses in time with a low, resonant hum that vibrates through the crystal hall.

*My* heart. Not literally, of course, but the design, the delicate balance of its whirring components, the unique chime it produces – that intricate soul was born from *my* sleepless nights, sketched onto countless napkins stained with coffee rings, argued for in meetings where my voice felt too quiet. I remember the frustration, the breakthroughs, the sheer *effort* of weaving logic and intuition into that tangible form.

A voice, ancient and vast, echoes from the crystal facets themselves, speaking not in words but in pure understanding that resonates directly in my mind. "Behold! The *Animus Mechanica*! A marvel of ingenuity, conceived and perfected by the singular brilliance of Marcus!"

The sunflowers rustle, a sound like a thousand silk banners unfurling, their version of applause. The golden light from the clockwork heart intensifies, casting Marcus in a halo of glory. He bows, a serene, beatific smile playing on his lips, accepting the silent adoration.

And I... I am rooted to the spot, though my feet don't quite touch the crystalline floor. A peculiar sensation washes over me – a blend of surging pride that the *Animus Mechanica* exists and is beautiful, tangled inextricably with a cold, hollowing sense of *erasure*. It feels as though my contribution, the very essence of my work, is being siphoned away, flowing like invisible streams towards Marcus, bolstering his radiant form while leaving me... paler, less substantial.

I try to raise my hand, to clear my throat, to call out, "I helped! That curve, that delicate counterweight, the stabilization sequence – that was *me*!" But my voice is trapped, a leaden weight in my throat. My limbs feel heavy, unresponsive, as if sculpted from drying clay. The vibrant colors of the crystal hall seem to leach *through* me, making me translucent, a mere apparition against the dazzling spectacle.

It's not simple anger or jealousy; it's a more profound, bewildering ache. It’s the feeling of being a ghost at one's own feast, watching someone else savor the meal you painstakingly prepared. The golden light radiating from the clockwork heart feels warm on Marcus, but on my dream-skin, it feels like ice, highlighting my invisibility.

One of the giant sunflowers slowly swivels its massive head towards me. Its dark center seems to deepen, not with recognition, but with a vast, silent question: *Why are you even here?* The implied irrelevance is sharper than any accusation.

I watch as Marcus lifts the clockwork heart higher. With every pulse of its golden light, fragments of my own memory – the late nights, the discarded sketches, the eureka moments – seem to flake away from me like ash, drawn towards him, absorbed into his triumphant silhouette. I feel myself diminishing, fading, the hum of the amphitheater becoming distant, the light growing dimmer not externally, but within my own perception, as if *I* am the one receding into shadow while the undeserved spotlight shines ever brighter elsewhere... always elsewhere...
