I am dreaming. I am in a world of my own making, where anything is possible.  I hum a melody, and watch as mountains rise up from the ground, covered in snow and evergreen trees.  I hum another melody, and see rivers flow through valleys, with crystal clear water and fish swimming inside.  I hum yet another melody, and witness villages appear, with wooden houses and chimneys smoking coal.  I hum a fourth melody, and find myself surrounded by people, who are friendly and curious towards me.  

I stop humming for a moment, and listen to the sounds around me.  I hear the crunch of snow underfoot.  I hear the gurggle of water as it rushes downstream.  I hear the crackle of fire as it burns wood.  I hear the chatter of people as they talk to each other.  

I start humming again, this time creating a story that unfolds before me.  A group of hunters set out on a quest to kill a mythical beast that roams the land.  They follow clues left by mysterious symbols inscribed on rocks and trees.  They encounter obstacles such as cliffs and caves that test their courage and strength.  They eventually come face to face with the creature, which turns out not to be dangerous but rather scared and alone.  

I stop humming once more, and take in my surroundings.  I see the shapes of mountains, rivers, villages, and people all around me.  I feel a sense of wonder and creativity that fills me up inside.  I realize that this is what I want out of life â€“ to explore new possibilities, solve problems, and make connections with others.  

I start humming one last time, creating an ending for my dream that leaves hope and optimism in its wake.  The hunters decide to protect the creature instead of killing it.  They build a shelter for it where it can live in peace without fear.  They teach it about their culture and language so that they can communicate with each other effectively.  They watch as it grows into an adult who has friends and family of its own kind.  

And then I wake up, back in reality where things are not nearly as exciting or fascinating as they could be...
