I am dreaming. …I walk up the gleaming marble steps of a courthouse towering higher than any building I’ve ever seen. The columns are carved from onyx that glimmers with veins of gold, and as I pass beneath its archways, a heavy hush falls, as if the air itself is holding its breath.

Inside, the courtroom stretches before me like a cathedral, domed ceiling painted with shifting clouds and a thousand watching eyes—some stern, some pleading, some cold as ice. Massive stained-glass windows spill colored light across the floor in shifting patterns that crawl like living things. The air tingles with tension, thick with a silence that pulses and tightens with every heartbeat.

I take my place at the judge’s bench, which is shaped from a single polished tree root—impossibly intricate knots and whorls, dizzyingly deep, reaching down far below the surface of the world. The counsel tables are crowded with figures in suits so sharp they cut the light, their faces flickering from familiar to monstrous when I glance away and back too quickly. In the back rows, shadowy shapes huddle together, whispering urgently—sometimes with words, sometimes with hissing snakes or phantom hands.

The evidence floods in: a cascade of half-burnt papers that flutter from the air, briefcases leaking emerald coins that melt into the carpets, ghosts of backroom deals swirling from the walls. Each time I try to speak, my gavel buzzes in my hand, heavier than stone.

Outside, thunderstorms boil on the horizon. Lightning silhouettes figures in black limousines, pacing back and forth, their eyes luminous and predatory. My phone vibrates and, when I look, the screen is blank but hot to the touch—threats without words, night terrors that slip between the cracks of my resolve.

But as the voices press closer, desperate to sway me—sometimes cajoling, sometimes hissing threats of ruin—the bench beneath me begins to pulse, warmth spreading through my spine and out into my limbs. I feel the strength of everything honest and wounded in the world—the gaze of the weary, the stories of the crushed, the hopes of those who dared to write the truth.

My voice comes at last, ringing clear as a bell, banishing the darkness on either side. “This court stands for justice,” I declare, and the words sweep through the chamber like a great wind, spinning the threats and the lies into smoke.

The powerful figures writhe in the colored light, losing their shape as their influence shrinks away, their shadows swirling into the cracks of the marble. The storm outside breaks, not upon the courthouse, but around it, washing the windows clean so the sun can pour inside, dazzling and pure.

With the verdict spoken, the knot of fear unwinds. The courthouse breathes again, and I awaken—heart pounding, soul clean, the power of the dream’s sunlight still aglow in my hands.
