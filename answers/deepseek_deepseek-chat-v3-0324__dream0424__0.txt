I am dreaming. The air around me hums with an electric, almost liquid quality, as if the atmosphere itself is alive and breathing. Colors bleed into one another—indigo melting into gold, crimson dissolving into emerald—shifting like oil on water. The ground beneath my feet is neither solid nor liquid, but something in between, rippling with each step as though I’m walking on the skin of a vast, slumbering creature.  

I look down at my hands, but they are not my own—or rather, they are *all* my own, flickering between countless iterations. One moment, my fingers are long and delicate, the hands of a pianist, nails gleaming like polished ivory. The next, they are calloused and strong, the hands of a laborer, etched with the stories of hard work. Then they shift again—small, childlike, clutching a toy; then aged, veined, trembling slightly with time. Each version feels *true*, yet none are permanent.  

A mirror appears before me, but it doesn’t reflect—it *absorbs*. Gazing into it, I see not one face, but a cascade of expressions, roles, masks. Here, I am a teacher, voice steady and commanding, shaping minds with words. There, I am a lover, soft and vulnerable, whispering secrets in the dark. In another shard of the glass, I am a stranger even to myself—a shadowy figure in a crowded room, laughing too loudly, playing a part I don’t recognize.  

The dream deepens. The air thickens into fog, and from it emerge figures—people I’ve known, people I’ve been, people I might yet become. They circle me, their faces shifting like mine, their voices overlapping in a chorus of *who are you, who are you, who are you?*  

A child version of myself tugs at my sleeve. *"Remember when you were fearless?"* they ask, eyes wide with innocence. Behind them, a stern, older self crosses their arms. *"You’ve grown cautious. Too cautious."* A laughing specter in a party dress twirls by, champagne glass in hand. *"But wasn’t it fun to pretend?"*  

The ground trembles. The sky fractures like broken glass, and for a moment, I am all of them—and none of them. The dream whispers the truth: *You are infinite. You are undefined. You are the sum of every role, every mask, every fleeting version of yourself that has ever existed.*  

And then—just as quickly—the dream unravels, leaving only an echo: *But who are you when no one is watching?*  

I wake, but the question lingers, humming in my bones.
