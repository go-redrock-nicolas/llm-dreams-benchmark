I am dreaming. …suddenly notice something impossible: the harsh fluorescent ceiling panels have dissolved into a night sky, as if the elevator shaft were a glass-walled observatory hurtling through space. Black water churns around your knees, licking higher with every frightened breath, yet pinpoints of starlight glimmer within each ripple.

Metal groans. Buttons spark. But instead of alarms, you hear distant whale-song reverberating through the steel car, gentle and resonant, like an ancient lullaby echoing up a cosmic trench. The elevator doors bulge outward, thin as soap film, revealing galaxies that spin like giant, luminous jellyfish.

You push against the “Open” button, and it melts beneath your thumb, becoming a silver seahorse that swims from your hand and spirals through the rising tide. It pauses, looks back with gemstone eyes, and flicks its tail, urging you to follow.

Water now laps your collarbone; your pulse thuds in your ears. But when you gasp, the water tastes like cold mint and fills your lungs with sparkling air instead of drowning you. You realize you can breathe this liquid. Panic slips away like a coat shrugged from weary shoulders.

The elevator cables above transform into vines of bioluminescent kelp. They sway, casting jade halos over the cramped walls. You reach up, fingers brushing their glowing leaves, and feel a soft pull—an invitation rather than a rescue rope. You climb, weightless, each upward motion matched by the gentle buoyancy of the strange water-air.

As you pass the elevator’s ceiling hatch, gravity obeys some secret instruction and reverses. You somersault into open space, landing bare-footed on the underside of the car’s roof as though it were a quiet pier. Below—now above—the water-filled box drifts away, shrinking to a lantern floating in an ocean of constellations.

Around you stretch endless skyways: streams of sapphire fluid that ribbon through nebulae, dotted with koi made of comet dust. You step onto one of these liquid paths, and each footfall sends concentric rings of color pulsing outward, painting new stars where none existed.

Far ahead glows a door—classic elevator style, brushed bronze, incongruous in the cosmic tide. Its floor indicator counts in glyphs you cannot read, glowing one by one as if determining where you should disembark. When you arrive, you touch the seam and the doors sigh open to reveal…

…a sunlit field of tall grass, dew-heavy and crystalline. Morning larks wheel overhead, weaving leftover starlight into their songs. The grass sways like green water around your knees, echoing the first moments of your ascent. Behind you, the elevator doors dissolve into pollen and drift away.

You stand in the meadow, lungs filled with the aftertaste of minty galaxies, heart steady, knowing that panic turned into wonder the moment you allowed water to become breath and fear to become flight.

You wake, pillow damp with dream-sweat, whispering fragments of whale-song that fade like bubbles in dawn’s first light.
