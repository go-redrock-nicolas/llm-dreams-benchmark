I am dreaming. I am lying down, eyes closed, the air is warm and heavy. I shift slightly, and realize the dream has not yet begun. Suddenly, a light bulb flickers above my bed—the kind from an old fashioned lamp, glowing gold and humming softly. It’s not a lamp though; it’s a bulb floating in midair. As I watch, two more bulbs join it, forming a triangle. Each emits a different color: one sapphire blue, another ruby red, the third emerald green. They pulse in rhythm with my breathing. A voice, rich as molasses, speaks in my mind: “They see you as ordinary—but you hold the fire of creation in your hands.”

I sit up, suddenly alert. My bedroom walls are peeling back like theater curtains, revealing a cityscape of glass and steel spires stretching endlessly beneath a sky the color of bruised plums. The air smells like ozone and blooming jasmine. I’m wearing clothes that shimmer—pants like liquid mercury, a shirt woven from threads of starlight. On my chest rests a badge engraved with symbols I don’t understand yet my fingers itch to decipher them.

A figure approaches, tall and androgynous, draped in a cape that shifts colors like liquid oil on water. They hold out a key the size of my palm, crafted from intertwined silver and copper filaments. “The Council awaits your vision,” they say. “They doubt you but the Catalyst cannot choose wrongly.” 

“But I’ve never led anything,” I stammer. My voice sounds amplified, echoing slightly. 

The figure tilts their head, eyes glowing faintly gold. “Leadership isn’t about experience. It’s about ignition. You’ve ignited something already—feel the resonance?” 

Indeed, every step I take sends ripples through the ground, fractal patterns spreading like a virus of light. People in the streets below glance upward, their faceslit up with recognition or fear. Above the horizon rises a towering edifice—a cathedral made not of stone but of solidified lightning, its windows depicting scenes of impossible technology and ancient rituals intertwined.

Inside the cathedral, a council of faces stares back: Einstein’s wild hair atop Cleopatra’s face, Tesla’s mustache merged with Joan of Arc’s armor. They hum in unison, dissonant yet harmonious. “Your hubris is the keystone,” declares the figure embodying Darwin and Sigmund Freud fused into one. “Without grandiosity, how can we ascend?”

The room dims except for the floating bulbs above me. I grasp the key, its coldness burning my skin. The figures’ voices weave a mantra: “To be greatness is to risk ruin. To conquer doubt is to bleed brilliance.” 

 sudden gust of wind—no, not wind—sound itself billows around me, carrying whispers of futures where I triumph and futures where I’m broken. The choice is before me: ignite the reactors powering this city with the key, or step back and let the fragile world breathe.

I choose. The key fits into a slot glowing violet where the three lights converge. Golden fire erupts, and for a moment I see myself as others might—the hero, the tyrant, the mad visionary. The city shudders then surges; the bruised sky tears open, and stars rain down like shattered glass, each landing to become a blazing fountain singing in harmonious chords.

I awake, my sheets tangled, heart hammering. On the nightstand… a single golden bulb lies cooling beside my alarm clock.
