I am dreaming.   

The air around me is thick with the scent of jasmine and wet earth—a storm has just passed, leaving the world glistening under a silver-blue twilight. I stand on the cobblestones of an ancient, forgotten alleyway, tucked between two leaning buildings whose faded murals whisper in peeling paint. The street lamps flicker with a buttery glow, but nobody else seems to notice the magic here.  

Then I see it.  

Nestled in a crack between the stones, almost hidden, is a tiny garden—no larger than my palm. Delicate mushrooms, glowing like bioluminescent moons, rise in clusters. Ferns unfurl in fractal spirals, each dewdrop clinging to them like liquid jewels. A single white moth, its wings edged in gold, rests on a petal-thin leaf, breathing softly. It feels like stumbling upon a cathedral built for whispers.  

A passing couple murmurs about the weather. They don’t even glance down.  

But I crouch, mesmerized. As my fingertips brush the moss, the moth takes flight—and suddenly, the alley *expands*. The cobblestones dissolve into a river of stars beneath my feet. The murals on the walls ripple to life: painted birds take wing, sailing into a sky now swirling with auroras. The jasmine scent deepens, intoxicating, as if the air itself is singing.  

I realize—this hidden beauty was always a door. And now, heart pounding, I step forward... into the luminous unknown.   

(What happens next? Do I follow the moth? Trace the path of stars? Or does the dream shift again—?)
