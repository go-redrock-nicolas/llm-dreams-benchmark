I am dreaming. In the swirling mists of my subconscious, I find myself standing before an ornate, antique mirror. As I gaze into its polished surface, the reflection staring back at me isn't my own image, but rather, the emblem of my beloved brand - a symbol I've grown to trust and associate with comfort, quality and belonging.

As if drawn by an unseen force, I step into the mirror, which ripples like water before solidifying once again behind me. I find myself transported to an ethereal realm, bordering on a beautiful nightmare. The landscape is lush and green, dotted with the hallmarks of my trusted brand - the star-shaped packaging, the signature fonts, even the gentle hum of their trademark jingle echoing on an unseen breeze.

But something is off. As I walk, the lush green fields of my dream begin to wither and die before my eyes. The once vibrant label now appears dull and faded, the logo distorted. 

Suddenly, I'm in an endless hallway lined with tall, stone walls and bright fluorescent lighting. I see myself  trapped in a loop, striding over and over past scores of shabby storefronts, each bearing an unsettling resemblance to the product I hold dear. Their once inviting facades are now peeling and cracked, prices increasing to ridiculous numbers as the quality vanishes.

My heart pounds as I try to escape but every turn, every store is the same - adolescent fidelity morphing into disillusionment. Perspiration beads on my brow as I finally break free onto a bustling city street in the twilight. Competitor signs flicker all around, alternately luring and threatening.

There amidst this desolate cityscape, a bold vision appears of a drab, towering office building. Engraved in the stone is my brand's name, but it doesn't feel welcoming. It feels foreign, intimidating. Dozens of people, my fellow boi-friends, are camped out in a line that snakes out of frame, each holding a sign for their beloved brand. 

Weeks turn to months as we stand in line, the sleek brand's aesthetic morphing into the chaotic environment around us. It feels as though the essence of my beloved brand is being drained, borrowed out, stolen, in exchange for its image as a reputation.

As I turn my head, I catch a glimpse of the figure in charge, unmistakable in his unusual outfit. He strolls down the line with a placating smile, yet his eyes are cold. He approaches, holding out a familiar object. There, in his outstretched palm, I see a product I know all too wellâ€”the item I've been loyal to for years.

But when I reach for it, the dream freezes and then melts away. I wake up with a start, heart pounding, bedsheets tangled around me. The experience has left me unsettled, the lines between dream and reality blurred. I stare at the familiar packaging of my beloved brand on the nightstand, wondering if I should continue my loyalty despite the changes, or if it's time to explore new options. The decision weighs heavily on my mind as I drift back to sleep, hoping for a more restful dream this time.
