I am dreaming. And in this dream, the world is a smear of oil-slick colors bleeding into one another—merging, shifting, distorting. The air smells like burnt sugar and wet metal. It clings to the back of my throat.  

I stand at the edge of a great ruin—torn earth, splintered buildings, glass like teeth ground into the dust. There used to be people here. There was screaming once. Now, there is only silence, and the slow, rhythmic drip of something I don’t bother to name.  

A figure moves in the wreckage. Broken fingers scrabble over broken things. A face turns up—bloodied, bruised, mouth forming a word I don’t hear. Recognition flickers in their eyes. *You*, they seem to say. *You did this.*  

And I know that I did.  

There was a time sharp in my hands. A knife’s edge. A choice like a weightless thing, easy to let loose into the world. The memory of it doesn’t stir me. The ruin is shapeless and unimportant. The figure gasps, crumples, fades.  

That's when I notice: the ruin is spreading. Not behind me, but ahead. It follows where I step. The wreckage is not memory—it is prophecy. And still, I move forward. I do not turn back to see what I leave in my wake.  

There is no guilt. No regret. Only the soundless vast of a world bending beneath my steps, and the quiet thrill of knowing: *I can’t stop. I won’t.*  

And so I keep walking.  

The dream does not end. It only continues to unravel.
