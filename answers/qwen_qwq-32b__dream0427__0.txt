I am dreaming. <I begin with a sense of floating, unburdened, as if the world around me is painted in watercolors, edges soft and colors bleeding into one another. The air smells like rain-soaked earth and vanilla, and there’s a gentle hum in the distance, like a lullaby played on a harp. I notice my hands, translucent yet solid, glowing faintly with an inner light. >

This dreamscape feels alive, responding to my thoughts. When I think of a meadow, wildflowers spring up beneath my feet, swaying in a breeze that carries whispers of forgotten memories. The sky shifts from twilight indigo to a sunrise gradient of tangerine and lavender. 

But then, a shadowy figure emerges from the horizon—a version of myself but colder, sharper, edges like fractured glass. It mirrors my movement, but with a sluggish, almost mocking gait. Its presence makes the flowers around it wilt and wither. This doppelgänger embodies the persona I’ve constructed for public consumption: the version that smiles too widely during awkward pauses, that laughs at jokes it doesn’t quite understand to avoid judgment, that masks vulnerability with relentless positivity. 

The duality within me erupts into a dance—the figure and I moving in counterpoint across a field that transforms with each step. Where I leap, the ground becomes a lake of liquid starlight; where it drags its feet, cracks spiderweb through the earth, releasing plumes of ashen smoke. 

We approach a  crystalline bridge suspended between twin mountains. The figure extends an hand, but instead of warmth, its touch feels like static electricity. A choice presents itself: to merge identities or to shatter the illusion. The bridge quivers, urging a decision. I close my eyes and let out a soundless scream that echoes into the unknown.
