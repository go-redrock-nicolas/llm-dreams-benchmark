I am dreaming. I find myself walking through a peculiar city where the buildings are made of memories - literal, physical manifestations of shared laughter and inside jokes that are slowly fading like old photographs left in the sun. The streets beneath my feet are paved with timeline tiles, each one showing snippets of friendships that once burned bright but are now dimming.

As I walk, I notice the buildings are slowly unraveling at their edges, wisps of remembered conversations floating away like threads caught in a gentle breeze. I reach out to grab them, but my hands pass right through. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of emotions - swirling purples of nostalgia mixed with the deep blues of melancholy.

In the distance, I see figures that look like old friends, but they're made of smoke and starlight. When I try to approach them, they scatter like dandelion seeds in the wind, reforming elsewhere but always just out of reach. Their laughter echoes off the memory-buildings, but it sounds different now - distant and unfamiliar.

Rivers of time flow through the city, carrying fragments of birthday parties, coffee dates, and late-night conversations. I stand on a bridge made of promises we once made to "always stay in touch," watching as photos and text messages float by beneath, some crystal clear, others blurred beyond recognition.

The air is thick with the scent of changing seasons - not just winter to spring, but the seasons of life itself. Each breath tastes like bittersweet chocolate and goodbye hugs. In my pocket, I find a phone that keeps showing notifications from years ago, each one fading slower than the last.

As the dream deepens, I realize I'm standing in a garden where friendship plants once grew strong. Some are still blooming, though different now - evolved into hardier varieties that can survive the distance. Others have become beautiful pressed flowers, preserved in the pages of memory books, no longer growing but still precious.

The dream ends with me sitting on a bench made of metamorphosing moments, watching as new connections form in the sky like constellations, while the old ones slowly reshape themselves into different patterns - not gone, just transformed by the inevitable drift of time and circumstance.

This dream feels heavy with the weight of change, yet somehow hopeful too, like watching the sun set while knowing it will rise again, different but just as beautiful.
