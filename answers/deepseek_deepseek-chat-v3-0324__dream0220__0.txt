I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Kingdom of Backwards Courtesy**  

I find myself standing at the edge of a city that shouldn’t exist—its skyline a jagged mosaic of towers bent at impossible angles, their surfaces shimmering like liquid mercury under a violet-tinted sky. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as if the world itself is vibrating in reverse. A sign arches above the cobblestone street, wrought in gilded letters that rearrange themselves each time I blink:  

**"WELCOME TO THE COURT OF THE UNSPOKEN. POLITENESS IS PROFANITY HERE."**  

The streets teem with people, but they move in a deliberate chaos—strangers shoulder-check each other with exaggerated force, only to break into delighted laughter. A couple at a café table hurls steaming cups of tea into each other’s faces, and the surrounding crowd erupts in applause. "Such romance!" someone sighs.  

A figure draped in a cloak of stitched-together gloves (palms outward, fingers twitching like spider legs) steps into my path. Their face is obscured by a porcelain mask—cracked down the middle—etched with a grotesque, grinning sneer.  

**"You’re too stiff,"** they observe, reaching out to poke me hard in the chest. **"Your ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ cling to you like a bad stench. We can smell your decency."**  

I feel my face flush with reflexive indignation, but catch myself—here, offense is currency. I force a scowl and snap, "Your mask is ugly and your voice grates like a dying engine."  

The crowd around us gasps in approval. The masked figure tilts their head, delighted. **"Better! But still so… rehearsed."** They lean in, whisper hotly, **"Authenticity isn’t in the words. It’s in the spit between them."**  

I’m pulled deeper into their rituals—a banquet where guests throw food at the hosts, a theater where actors curse the audience mid-performance, lovers exchanging vows by listing each other’s flaws in trembling, venomous detail.  

By midnight, my throat is raw from insults I never knew I had in me. Yet the more I lean into the ugliness, the warmer their acceptance becomes—their laughter like a balm, their admiration ruthless and genuine.  

And then, just as I start to *belong*, I wake—tongue heavy with the ghosts of unkind words, wondering if politeness was ever my truth, or just a cage I never thought to rattle.
