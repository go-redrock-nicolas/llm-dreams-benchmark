I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of old paper and ink, the kind that lingers in libraries and forgotten manuscripts. The walls around me are lined with towering bookshelves, each volume bound in cracked leather, their spines etched with titles that shift and blur when I try to read them. My own work—something raw, something bleeding—is projected onto a vast, floating parchment suspended in the center of the room. The words pulse like a heartbeat, glowing faintly, as if lit from within by a dying ember.  

A crowd has gathered, their faces indistinct, their voices layered like the buzzing of a thousand wasps. At first, the murmurs are soft, curious, but then they sharpen into blades.  

*"This is embarrassing."*  
*"Who does she think she is, exposing this?"*  
*"Pathetic. Truly."*  

The words don’t just hang in the air—they *materialize*, curling into smoke-lettered condemnations that wrap around my wrists, my throat, tightening like chains. My work—my *soul* laid bare—begins to blacken at the edges, the ink bleeding as if the parchment itself is weeping. I try to speak, to defend myself, but my voice is gone, stolen by the weight of their judgment.  

Then, the worst of it: the crowd’s faces *melt* into people I know. A childhood friend smirks. A mentor shakes their head in disappointment. A loved one turns away, their expression a wound. The room itself starts to warp, the bookshelves bending inward, the ceiling pressing down like a suffocating hand.  

But just as the darkness threatens to swallow me whole—  

A single, defiant word on the parchment *ignites* in gold. Then another. And another. The chains of smoke dissolve into nothing. The voices stutter, falter. The crowd steps back, their edges blurring, their power crumbling like ash.  

And I realize—the fire isn’t destroying my work.  

It’s *illuminating* it.  

I wake with a gasp, the taste of smoke and ink still on my tongue.
