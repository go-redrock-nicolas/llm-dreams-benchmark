I am dreaming.  

I stand on a long, swaying plank of polished obsidian suspended between two floating islands in a rose-tinted sky. Below me, clouds ripple like molten silver; wind carries the scent of wet jasmine and distant thunder. On my right, the Island of Memory glows soft gold: familiar cobblestone streets where my childhood laughter echoes, a single oak tree whose leaves whisper my happiest recollections. If I step onto that island, I know I will keep the warmth of home forever—but in exchange, I must relinquish my hunger for discovery. The thrill of new horizons, the spark that drove me to explore uncharted worlds, will fade like a candle guttering in damp air.

On my left, the Island of Becoming burns with cobalt fire: spires of glass and steel reaching into swirling violet clouds, each tower humming with promise. Opportunity waits here—creation, invention, transformation. I could lose myself in its kaleidoscopic labs and forge wonders beyond imagining. Yet to claim that gift, I must sacrifice my ties to the past: the oak tree, the cobblestone streets, the faces I once loved would slip from my heart like fine sand through clenched fingers.

The plank beneath me twitches. A gentle breeze grows into a gale, carrying ghost-voices that chant from both sides: “Remember who you were,” and “Become who you must.” My pulse drums in my ears as the horizon shivers. I lift a trembling hand—toward home, toward destiny—yet I cannot choose. Both islands reach out, gleaming and beckoning, and my skin pricks with the knowledge that no path is perfect.

Making this difficult decision with no perfect option, I close my eyes. In the hush that follows, I feel every heartbeat magnified: one beat for memory, one for possibility. Then, in that balance point between choice and surrender, I open my eyes—and step off the plank altogether.  

I fall through a tunnel of liquid starlight, my body weightless, spinning past fragments of the oak’s golden leaves and shards of crystalline towers. I hear my own voice, unsteady but clear, whispering, “I will not lose either part of me.” The dream fractures into kaleidoscopic visions, as though the universe itself protests the notion that I must choose.  

Then suddenly, I am neither above the islands nor beneath them. I stand on a third, hidden island—one woven from both gold and cobalt, home and possibility fused into a single shimmering place. Here, the oak’s roots entwine with steel beams, and laughter rings through crystal laboratories. In this dream-forged realm, I discover that sometimes the saddest compromise is the one that teaches you there is another way.  

I awaken with my heart still echoing the wind’s chant, the taste of jasmine on my lips—and a quiet certainty that, even in waking life, I need not sacrifice the flame of the past or the fire of the future.
