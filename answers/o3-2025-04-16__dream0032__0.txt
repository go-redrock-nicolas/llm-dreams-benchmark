I am dreaming. …open my eyes into a plaza that seems to have been painted while the paint was still alive. Lanterns the size of moons float just above the tilework, bobbing like slow jellyfish, each lit by a different hue of emotion: amber laughter, cobalt sorrow, viridian envy, rose-quartz love. Music drifts from nowhere and everywhere at once—harps one moment, distant thunder the next—because, here, sound is only another color of feeling.

People flow past me as if poured from a single, restless pitcher. At first they look ordinary—families in bright scarves, dancers in wing-shaped masks, solitary wanderers tracing spirals with their fingertips—but the instant their emotions touch me, the thin skin of the world splits open.

A businessman hurries by, eyes on a pocketwatch. His anxiety hits me like cold metal between the teeth—clack, clack, clack—every second a razor-edged tick. My pulse stutters in perfect sync with his watch until he disappears into the crowd.

A child chases a comet-shaped balloon. Her giddy wonder blossoms inside my chest as an effervescent fountain; it fizzes up my throat until I taste lemon sugar on my tongue. I laugh—her laugh—my voice rising an octave that isn’t mine.

Then heartbreak: a woman clutching a crumpled letter. Her grief is a slow, black tide spilling through my ribcage. I feel the exact moment her knees almost give way, and I want to cradle the heavy sea for her. Instead I inhale, and her sorrow enters me like ink into water. Within seconds I’m carrying joy, dread, hope, rage, tenderness—scores of borrowed flames all flickering in one lantern of bone.

The weight becomes unbearable. I stagger to a fountain at the plaza’s center—its water glows with no visible light source—and plunge my hands beneath the surface. The pool is cool, yes, but also serene; it’s liquid forgiveness. The instant my fingers break the water, the fountain begins to hum in the key of my heartbeat, and emotions bleed out of me like dye. They swirl into luminescent spirals, each feeling sorting itself into its proper color. When I lift my hands again, droplets cling like tiny stained-glass windows, refracting inner storms back into rainbows.

Armed with this moment of clarity, I look out across the plaza and no longer drown in everyone else’s tides. Instead I sense patterns: a nervous chord here, a jubilant trill there, all of it weaving a cosmic music. By breathing slowly, I can pluck the threads, tune them. I loosen fear in one corner by borrowing a strand of courage from another soul; I blend two separated lovers’ longing into a duet; I tune a hush of collective anticipation just before the lanterns pulse and rise.

Finally the crowd pauses, faces upturned as the floating moons drift higher. Each lantern bursts—not in violence, but in gentle petals of light. Golden laughter, cobalt sorrow, viridian envy, rose-quartz love…all dissolve into a silent aurora sweeping across the dream-sky. Everyone watches, each person suddenly sharing the exact same awe. It pools within me as a single, resonant note—clear, sustained, vast enough to hold every smaller feeling without breaking.

For the first time I understand: I’m not meant to carry the world’s emotions alone. I’m meant to tune them into harmony. And so I let the note pass through me, up my spine like a beam of sunrise, out my fingertips in shimmering chords that ripple across the crowd. The aurora answers, bending into the shape of enormous wings, and when I blink—still dreaming—I’m lifted on that collective breath, soaring over the plaza, borne aloft by a thousand hearts beating in elegant unison.
