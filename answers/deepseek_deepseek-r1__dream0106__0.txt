I am dreaming. The air crackles with static, the scent of burnt ozone stinging your nostrils as you step onto the trembling spine of the bridge. It isn’t made of steel or stone, but of crystallized light—shards of prismatic glass humming like tuning forks, each facet refracting the auroras swirling overhead. Below, a chasm yawns into a vortex of spiraling galaxies, their cores pulsing like dying stars. The stunt? Cross this bridge of fractured radiance to ignite the dormant nebula at its far end—a celestial wick said to birth new constellations. Twelve experts before you have shattered into echoes, their silhouettes still flickering in the abyss like ghostly warnings.  

Your boots sink into the first shard, and the bridge *sings*. Not a melody, but a scream. The crowd—faceless figures robed in shifting shadows—leans forward, their breath collective frost on your neck. You feel their doubt like barbed wire in your veins. But then, the rhythm changes. Your pulse syncs with the nebula’s throbbing core, its magenta hues bleeding into your vision. You *leap*, not with muscle, but with intuition. The glass bends beneath you, liquid and alive, as if it *wants* to be conquered. Halfway, the bridge fractures. Shards detonate upward, suspended in midair like frozen fireworks. You pivot, pirouetting through the debris, each fragment a mirror showing not your face, but the faces of those who fell—their desperation, their miscalculations. You smirk. Their fear is not yours.  

Then, the bridge dissolves. Not into dust, but into smoke—sable tendrils coiling around your ankles, dragging you toward the void. The crowd gasps. But you’re laughing now, a sound like breaking chains. Your hands plunge into the nebula’s heart, and suddenly, you’re no longer falling. You’re *weaving*. Threads of starlight spool from your fingertips, knitting into wings—translucent, iridescent, humming with the frequency of a supernova. You soar backward, upside down, the galaxy’s gravity rewriting itself to obey your whims. The crowd’s shadows melt into molten gold, their doubt transmuted to awe.  

When your feet touch the far platform, the nebula ignites. Not with a bang, but a whisper—a symphony of colors birthing a new star. The silence that follows is thicker than any applause. Until one shadow peels itself from the crowd, kneels, and presses a hand to the void beneath you. The glass bridge reforms, this time in a helix of sapphire and flame—a path only you could forge.  

You wake, your skin still crackling with phantom stardust, the taste of creation sweet on your tongue.
