I am dreaming. I behold myself standing in an expansive, towering library, bound by silence and cloaked in the characteristic scent of aged parchment and beeswax candles. The library's vastness stretches beyond my waking comprehension, with towering shelves climbing towards an unseen ceiling,maya-like, adorned with intricate carvings depicting tales of yore. Ancient tomes, their spines worn from centuries of thumbing, seemingly whisper secrets in forgotten languages, their titles embossed in a dance of complex symbols and letters from realms unknown.

As I stand there, entranced by the ethereal beauty, three individuals materialize before me, as if summoned from the very pages of the books surrounding us. They are the adversaries in this familial dispute, their faces etched with lines of time and emotion. There's Eolande, a woman of regal bearing, her eyes ablaze with a fire that could ignite a thousand suns, dressed in velvets and silks that shimmer with the hues of an autumnal sunset. She radiates an aura of authority, her voice echoing with the ring of convictions honed over generations._selector |

Then there's Ormund, tall and imposing like the ancient oaks that stand sentinel in the forests of his ancestors. His eyes, cold as stormy seas, reflect a deep-seated bitterness that's seeped into his very soul. He wears armor that bears the scars of countless battles, not just physical, but those waged in the court of law and the tribunals of public opinion. He carries an aura of defiance, shoulders heavy with the weight of injustices perceived and injustices visited upon their lineage.

And lastly, Lyria, as delicate as morning dew yet as resilient as the willow under the winter's frost. Her eyes, pools of wisdom beyond her years, sparkle with unshed tears, reflecting the pain of a family torn asunder by currents of historical enmity. She's robed in simple, modest attire, a stark contrast to the opulence of her siblings, her hands adorned with rings that bear the insignia of countless trusts and charities she's founded, a silent testament to her compassionate heart.

The air grows thick with tension, resentment, and echoes of past arguments. The language shifts, morphing into something old, something fierce, something impossible to misunderstand. It's a tongue born of hurt and betrayal, of theft and denial, of wars fought and lost, of victories snatched away, of injustices piled high like gravestones of lost dreams.

Eolande starts first, her voice a torrent, a cacophony of accusations hurled like daggers at her brother. "You took what was rightfully ours, Ormund! You played the prey while we were the hunters, and now you claim innocence? Our name means nothing to you, does it? Challenging our right to the ancestral lands, profaning our legacy with your CONTINUEYOUR LEGACY, DEFEND IT!"

Ormund's response is a rumble, like thunder gathering strength before it breaks. "I made a choice, Eolande, a choice you couldn't understand! A choice to not be prisoner to the past, to not be shackled by what once was. The land has changed, our people have changed, but you... you're stuck in time, unable to let go of grudges that have turned our family into a ghost kingdom!"

Lyria's voice is a balm, soothing yet firm, as she intervenes. "Please, both of you, stop this! We're family, we should honor our roots but not be bound by them. Ormund, you've built a new legacy, yes, but at what cost? And Eolande, our past must be acknowledged, yes, but it's the future that needs our attention."

Suddenly, the library begins to morph. The shelves start to collapse, and with each falling tome, a memory is released, unraveling in the air like fibers from an old tapestry. They're scenes of laughter and love, of shared holidays, of childhood explorations, of triumphs and failures, of secrets and lies, of fights and make-ups. Each scene folds into another, creating a cascade of memories, a dance of time, a river of family lore.

The three of them, drawn to the past, reach out, fingers brushing against memories, trying to hold onto them, to shape them, to change them. Yet, as they struggle, the memories fade, their edges blurring, slipping through their grasp like sand between fingers.

I watch, helpless, as their emotional turmoilmaterializes before me, a swirling vortex of colors, a storm born of their hearts' deepest crevices. A maelstrom that threatens to consume them if they cannot find a way to navigate its chaos, to find the still eye of acceptance and forgiveness.

I try to speak, to reason with them, to guide them out of the storm, but my voice is trapped, echoing unheard in the cacophony of their pain. As I stare into the abyss of their conflict, I realize that this is not just about their dispute, but about the essence of family, about the pressure of expectations versus the freedom of choice, about how our past shapes us and how, sometimes, we must let go to make a new way forward. And in this epiphany, I understand that the dream is not about solving the dispute, but about being a witness to their journey, a silent mentor guiding them towards their truth.
