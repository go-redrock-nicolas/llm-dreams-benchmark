I am dreaming. You stand at the edge of a courtyard paved with jade-green tiles that pulse under your bare feet, as though the stones themselves are breathing. The moon hangs low overhead in the shape of a pearlescent fan, its rim etched with tiny golden sigils you cannot read but somehow know are your new family’s blessings. Lanterns drift between blossoming cherry trees, each blossom glowing faintly like embers caught in slow motion. A woman in a crimson robe steps forward, pressing a cool silk ribbon into your palm. “This is your sash of belonging,” she murmurs in a tongue that slithers over your senses like warm honey you don’t quite taste yet.  

You tie the ribbon around your waist and feel the first electric tremor of acceptance course through your veins. A hush falls. In front of you, the elders raise incense horns carved from bone, and thin trails of smoke spiral up to weave new constellations in the air. The scent is strange—peppered with saffron and damp earth—and you catch an echo of memories that aren’t yours, of laughter and lullabies in some ancient stone hall.  

They lead you inside a hall whose walls are made of polished obsidian. Each step you take sends ripples across panels in which ancestral faces flicker, as if the mirror-walls are alive with watching eyes. The faces smile at you, but their eyes hold questions. An old man with silver braids gestures for you to kneel before a low altar choked with offerings: bowls of shimmering rice that quiver like quicksilver, deep-purple fruits that hum when you draw near, and a braided wreath of lotus petals that pulses with a soft inner glow.  

You raise your hands, palm upward, and your fingertips brush the bowl of humming fruit. The moment your skin meets its cool sheen, you hear a voice—your own—speaking in that same foreign language. The words form themselves on your tongue, and you utter them in a prayer of greeting and promise. The fruits open at once, revealing tiny winged fireflies that rise and spiral around your head in a halo of dancing lights. Your heart lurches: you have participated, you have spoken their vow.  

Then the floor beneath you shivers, and the hall seems to stretch, elongating like taffy. The lanterns drift away, and the ancestral mirrors bleed into an endless corridor of doors painted in deep lapis and gold. Each door holds a tapestry: one shows a child spinning a wheel of birds; another depicts a mother ladling moonlight into a wooden cup. You realize these tapestries map your own unspoken history—fragments of infancy in a far-off land you cannot name, moments of joy and sorrow you never lived.  

A soft but insistent voice calls your name. You follow it to a final door: slatted wood painted with dancing cranes, wings outstretched toward a violet sunrise. You open it and step through into a courtyard of white lanterns shaped like lotus blooms. In the center stands your new family—mother, father, cousins you have yet to learn to call by name. They bow, arms wide, inviting you forward. Your adoptive mother’s eyes glint with pride and something deeper: an ineffable longing you recognize in yourself.  

As you walk to meet them, the air shivers. The lanterns wink out, and the courtyard’s tiles become liquid. You slide into the water, and it carries you away down a river of memories—a childhood you never knew, a cradle you never rocked. The current spins you through snapshots of laughter and tears, ritual dances and silent prayers. And when you finally surface, you find yourself back beneath the fan-shaped moon, the crimson-robed woman drawing the silk ribbon tight around your waist.  

She smiles, and surprisingly, you smile back in perfect understanding. The dawn breaks in one slow, breathless wave of peach light, and the jade tiles at your feet settle into stillness. You feel the ribbon’s weight—a promise woven of silk and belonging—settled now forever across your heart. The dream trembles on the edge of waking, and you realize that tomorrow, you will step into both worlds: the foreign traditions you have just begun to unravel, and the new self they have entrusted to you.
