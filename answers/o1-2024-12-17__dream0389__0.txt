I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and in this dream, a shimmering twilight cascades around me like a liquid curtain. In the distance, a strange glow saturates the sky, mingling fluorescent purples and watery greens into a cosmic swirl. It feels otherworldly, as if I have slipped off the planet and found myself teetering on the edge of a new dimension.

I catch a glimpse of someone—an old friend, perhaps, or a hazy figure I can’t fully latch onto. This person radiates an uncanny brilliance, as though every success I have ever yearned for is shimmering over their head like a crown of glowing embers. My heart lurches with envy, and it’s such a painful, unexpected pang that I stumble in the dream’s thick, ever-shifting landscape.

The ground beneath me is soft and mutable, like damp sand that grips my feet. My chest feels tight with that familiar, haunting pulse: jealousy. The sky overhead churns with velvet clouds shaped like glorious accolades and swirling trophies—symbols of accomplishment that only seem to emphasize my discomfort. They hover, mocking me gently, a constant reminder of what I haven’t yet achieved.

A part of me wants to turn away from the vision of that triumphant figure. Yet, I’m drawn closer, compelled to understand why this jealousy stings so deeply. As I step forward, the ground around me shifts like it’s made from living shadows. The dream landscape ripples, and I find myself at the edge of an impossibly grand amphitheater.

Within this amphitheater, rows of seats ascend like partial steps leading to crystal arches. Each arch reflects a life memory: moments of my own celebrations, my own well-earned victories, the times when I stood on a stage with applause surrounding me. I see myself after a hard-fought competition, arms raised triumphantly, face illuminated with raw joy. Then, flickering across the gilded air, I see the face of someone else, brimming with that same bright smile—except now, it’s the person who ignited my jealousy.

In the dream, I tilt my head, uncertain, as if clarity is just out of reach. I notice little swirling motes of light—tiny holographic sparks that flit around me like curious fireflies. Drawn to me, they seem to sense my roiling swirl of envy, uncertainty, and genuine admiration. One by one, the motes glow and dart toward my heart. Soft warmth flows through my chest, causing me to breathe deeply.

Gradually, the feeling of jealousy begins to soften. My eyes lift toward the arches, noticing how my own memories and the other person’s successes coexist, glowing side by side. It’s as if the dream is laying bare the recognition that celebrating others does not erase my own worth. My achievements still glimmer as brightly as any crowning glory.

That triumphant figure begins to ascend the amphitheater steps. Their footsteps echo, yet in a gentle, melodic way—a lullaby of possibilities. I realize the dream wants me to approach them. My heartbeat quickens, but I press forward. With each step, the swirling shadows beneath my feet recede, replaced by a glimmering path like pearls on wet sand. The heady mix of purple and green sky fades into a soft rose gold, as if the horizon is blessing me with serenity.

Standing face to face now, I see the other person’s expression is not defined by superiority but by kindness and openness. Their eyes are bright with the warmth of someone who understands the mountains I’ve climbed, the deserts I’ve crossed. My jealousy, once a fist clenching in my gut, slowly dissolves into a sense of kinship. I feel a weight lift from my shoulders, leaving behind a fluttery sensation like delicate moth wings beating gently in my chest.

Then, with an inaudible command, the amphitheater arches blaze with vivid light. The entire scene vibrates with a shared sense of accomplishment, as though the energy of both of our successes resonates through the air. A gentle wind stirs up petals from unseen flowers, blossoming everywhere in a swirl of crimson and sparkling pale blue.

Tears prick the corners of my eyes, but they are tears of release, of gratitude. The sound of applause from some distant corridor of my own mind fills the amphitheater. I smile—truly smile—because I realize I can hold on to my own ambitions and celebrate another’s achievements at the same time, that there is an abundance of success to go around.

And in that shimmering moment, I feel the dream dissolve like water trickling through my fingers. Yet the warmth remains, and as I stir from sleep, I hold on to the memory of those glowing arches, those flowing petals, and the surprising relief of letting go of jealousy.
