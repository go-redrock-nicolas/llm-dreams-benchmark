I am dreaming. The sky above me is a vast canvas of swirling indigo and violet, painted with rivers of liquid starlight that ripple like silk in the wind. I am standing on a bridge of luminescent glass, suspended between two worlds—one shadowed in memory, the other shimmering with possibility. The air hums with a soft, resonant frequency, as if the universe itself is exhaling into the hush of my thoughts.  

This place—neither real nor imagined—feels ancient, like a forgotten folktale whispered beneath the stars. And as I step forward, the glass beneath my bare feet pulses with light, etching paths where none had existed before. Each step echoes with the weight of years.  

I realize now why I am here.  

A memory takes shape—foggy at first, rising like steam from the broken earth. A betrayal, long settled in my soul like a stone in a riverbed: words once sharp as flint, now worn smooth by time and silence. Someone I loved—or thought I loved—closes a door in my mind, slamming it shut without looking back. The feeling floods in again, not rage, but the cold ache of being unseen, unheard. The kind of pain that grows roots in your chest and whispers at odd hours: *remember how they hurt you?*  

But here in the dream, the whispers grow quieter.  

A voice, soft but sure, drifts from the horizon: **"You are free to walk another path."**  

Before me appears a lake—its surface still, black as the inside of an onyx gemstone. My reflection stares back, not as I am, but as I was… and then, as I could be. The lines of my face soften, the storm behind my eyes calms. I kneel beside the lake and dip my fingers into the water, and with each ripple, scenes of the past emerge: the wound, yes—but also the laughter that came before. The joy that once colored our connection, before pain turned it jagged.  

Beneath the hurt lies truth I had buried: people are not only the worst moments of their lives. I, too, have caused wounds. I, too, have forgotten to apologize for the tremors I caused.  

And suddenly, I am standing before the person in the dream—not the person they were in my anger, but someone softer, more fragile. Eyes wide, not with cruelty, but fear. Loss. Regret.  

The dream does not demand I excuse what happened. It asks only that I see.  

The air shifts again, and this time the wind is warm, carrying scent of forgotten gardens and drying rain. The lake boils like molten silver and begins to lift into the sky, returning to the stars. With it goes the weight I have carried—the bitterness, the stories I crafted where I was the hero and they were the villain. It all begins to dissolve in the dream's golden breath.  

A tree grows from the center of the lake as it vanishes, reaching toward the firmament with branches made of living fire. I understand: forgiveness is not giving up your pain, but allowing yourself to stop holding it like a torch.  

In this moment, I am both the forgiver and the forgiven.  

When I awaken—gradually, tenderly—the resentment is still there, like an old scar. But now I know its edges, and I know I do not have to wear it like a skin.  

The dream gifts me something more than relief.  
It gives me choice.
