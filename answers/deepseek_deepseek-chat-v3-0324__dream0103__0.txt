I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and something older, something like forgotten incense lingering in the shadows. Before me, a massive slab of obsidian stone rises from the ground, its surface polished to a mirror sheen, yet marred by deep, jagged carvings that seem to pulse faintly, as though breathing. The symbols are alien—neither letters nor pictures, but something in between, shifting when I blink, rearranging themselves like living ink.
