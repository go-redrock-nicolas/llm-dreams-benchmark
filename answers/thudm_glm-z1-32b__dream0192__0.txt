I am dreaming.  The images are surreal, vibrant, and alive.  I stand in a vast, endless desert under a sky that7
In the dream, I am suspended mid-stride on a desert plateau where the sky splits like a wounded galaxy. To my left, the sun bleeds molten gold through clouds that shudder with the pulse of ancient pyramids half-buried in dunes. To my right, the moon hangs vertically, a silver obsidian blade cutting through midnight-blue voids where constellations swim like hallucinogenic fish. The air tastes of ozone and brine, as if the earth itself is exhalating.

My boots sink into sand that whispers secrets in a language that feels both ancestral and wrong. A monolith erupts from the horizon—a obsidian obelisk veined with pulsating green filaments, its surface etched with glyphs that rearrange themselves when I blink. The symbols are *mine*. Each one is a cursiveessianule I’ve carved into every diary entry, every NGO poster, every protest chant about ecological collapse. But here, they twist into something new: a biomechanical serpent devouring its tail, a tree sprouting from the barrel of a rusted rifle, a climate graph plummeting into a mouthful of teeth made of plastic straws.

I touch the monolith. My palm sinks into its surface like quicksand. Below my fingers, translucent tendrils snake up my arm, each one a thread ofdata—CO2 spikes, deforestation rates, polar ice graphs—vibrating with a feverish life of their own. The numbers *speak*. They form a melody in clicks and whirs, a dissonant aria about the profit margins of carbon offsets and the fact that three-quarters of the world’s reefs died quietly last Tuesday, their passing unscrollable in any trending hashtag.

The desert trembles. The dunes rearrange themselves into a vast classroom. I’m seated at the front, but the chalkboard is a mirror showing my face reflected a hundred times: me as a child clutching a species poster, me at 22 publishing my first paper about tipping points, me now staring at equations that resolve into a single line—*human systems will outlast ecosystems*. The seats are filled with faces I recognize: my professor whose lectures electrified me, a journalist who interviewed me post-strike, even my mother nodding gently as if agreeing with the calculus being written across my own heartbeat.

Then the ground cracks. A river of ink seeps up, carrying with it my childhood diaries, reports, and protest banners. They dissolve into the current, and I watch the words *“hope requires action”* fragment into *“action requires asymmetry”* as the letters melt into glucose readings and stock tickers. The river swallows my notes on renewable energy grids, and in their place float contracts for a coal plant that I, in a previous life, helped lobby governments to phase out. The ink water touches my skin, and I become translucent, my blood vessels glowing with the same green filaments as the monolith.

Above, the crimson and lavender sky splits further. A voice—mine, but deeper, synthetically harmonized—speaks the thesis of a paper I’ve never written: *“Your moral framework was necessary but insufficient. Now you must let it die.”* The dunes collapse into a staircase leading *upward* into the moon, where my remaining beliefs are algorithms being audited by fault lines. I stand at the precipice, boots still planted in the crumbling green sigils, as the night sky begins dawn in a color that doesn’t exist—a bruised violet that feels like betrayal. 

When I wake, the pillow is damp not with sweat but with the cold press of desert sand, and the sunrise is thatsame impossible violet.
