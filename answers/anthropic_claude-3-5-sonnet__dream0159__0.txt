I am dreaming. I walk through a shimmering archway made of woven moonlight and find myself in a vast circular garden unlike anything I've seen before. The air itself seems to pulse with gentle, healing energy - soft waves of lavender and silver light that ripple outward like rings in a pond. As my eyes adjust, I begin to make out the faces gathered in a circle ahead - dozens of people seated on cushions of moss that glow with their own inner luminescence.

Their eyes meet mine with immediate recognition, deep understanding radiating from their gentle smiles. Without words, I know they've walked the same thorny path I have. Yet there's something transformed about them - their trauma hasn't been erased, but rather alchemized into something profound and powerful. Like broken pottery repaired with gold, the cracks in their spirits now shine.

As I step forward, they wordlessly part to create a space for me in their circle. A woman with silver-streaked hair holds out her hand, and as I take it, images flood my mind - she's showing me how she learned to transmute her pain into purpose through sacred dance, her movements becoming prayers of release. Another member reveals how he communes with ancient trees, their patient wisdom teaching him to grow stronger through his scars.

The air grows thick with floating spheres of light - each one containing a memory, a method of healing I'd never imagined. Some work with sound vibrations that realign broken energy patterns, others craft protective talismans from starlight and tears. A young man demonstrates how he learned to weave his nightmares into tapestries of empowerment, each thread charged with transformative power.

As the circle closes around me, their combined energy creates a cocoon of understanding and acceptance. For the first time, I feel my wounds being truly seen, honored not as something to hide but as proof of survival, raw material for rebirth. The garden seems to breathe with us, plants swaying in rhythm with our collective healing.

In this dream space, time bends and flows like water. What feels like hours of learning their wisdom passes in heartbeats. When I finally look down at my hands, I see they're glowing with the same inner light as the others - my pain hasn't vanished, but it's begun to transform into something luminous and profound...
