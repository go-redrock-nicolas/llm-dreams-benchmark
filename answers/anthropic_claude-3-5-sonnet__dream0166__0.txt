I find myself in a vast circular amphitheater, its crystalline walls stretching impossibly high into a violet-tinged sky. Hundreds of faces peer down at me from tiered seats that seem to ripple like water, their features constantly shifting between human and otherworldly forms. Before me stands an enormous, intricate machine - a bewildering fusion of ancient clockwork and pulsing bio-organic matter.

The air thrums with anticipation as I realize I'm meant to calibrate this living machine, a procedure that master technicians train lifetimes to perfect.
