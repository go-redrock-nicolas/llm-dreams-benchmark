I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You stand in a cathedral of glass and steel—a control room suspended above an endless abyss, its floor a shimmering pane that reveals a churning void below. The walls pulse with holographic schematics, glowing veins of data that snake and twist like living things. Your hands hover over a console of floating keys, each one humming with the weight of a thousand lives. This is the Nexus, the last bastion of order in a world held together by fragile protocols. One misstep, one blink too long, and the systems you oversee will unravel—power grids will collapse, dams will burst, satellites will spiral into the sea, and the sky itself might forget to breathe.  

The air smells of ozone and burnt copper, a scent that clings to your lungs like a warning. You’ve memorized every line of code, every subroutine, every heartbeat of the machine. But tonight, the system is *wrong*.  

It begins with a flicker—a single amber light blinking where there should be none. You lean closer, and the hologram shivers, its geometric perfection fracturing into jagged, organic shapes. Symbols you’ve never seen crawl across the interface, glyphs that seem to *drip*, as if written in ink that refuses to dry. The console’s voice, usually a calm, genderless hum, stutters into a whisper: *“They’re coming. They’re here.”*  

Your pulse thrums in your ears. You scan the protocols, but the anomalies multiply. A firewall dissolves like sugar in rain. A failsafe labeled **DO NOT TOUCH** blinks invitingly, its font shifting to something serpentine. You reach to override it, but your hand passes through the key—it’s a ghost, a projection. The real console is gone.  

The room darkens. The void beneath the glass begins to rise.  

Now the anomalies are no longer digital. Shadows peel themselves from the corners, pooling into shapes with too many joints, too many eyes. They move like smoke given malice, brushing against the glass as if testing its strength. The alarms don’t sound—*they scream*, a chorus of distorted voices wailing in languages that predate humanity. You try to run, but the floor liquefies, and you sink into a cold that burns.  

You fall.  

But not downward.  

You fall *sideways*, through layers of reality. A desert of clockwork scorpions clicking their mandibles in unison. A forest of frozen screams, trees made of teeth. Finally, you land in a chamber where the walls are made of beating hearts, each one synchronized to a different rhythm. At the center floats a child’s toy—a wooden soldier, missing an arm—spinning slowly in the air. Its single eye is a camera lens, and it’s pointed at you.  

The voice returns, now your own: *“You let them in.”*  

You wake up gasping, your desk lamp casting a feeble glow over a cluttered workspace. The dream clings to you, its terror sharp as a blade. But on your monitor, a single line of text blinks in the corner of your screen, invisible to anyone else:  

**“They’re still watching.”**  

And somewhere, deep in the code you wrote yesterday, a new subroutine has appeared—one you never programmed.
