I am dreaming. You slip through a corridor of whispering light—walls pulsing in soft lavender and jade, as though breathing. Every step squishes like wet sand, and the air shimmers with distant laughter that tugs at your memory’s edge. You know there’s something here, a kernel of truth, but it keeps drifting away, elusive as bubbles rising in oil.  

Ahead, a great mirror stands propped against nothing. Its glass ripples like water stirred by invisible fins.  As you lean closer, the surface fractures into a dozen slivers, each reflecting a snippet of that disputed afternoon:  
 • In one shard, sunlight strikes a garden’s white marble bench; you’re twirling a copper coin in your palm.  
 • In another, a tall figure in a charcoal coat laughs—with your voice—yet when you open your mouth, only silence spills out.  
 • In a third, a broken clock ticks backward, its hands melting into the numbers.  

You press your forehead against the cold mirror, and suddenly the fragments peel away like petals, drifting into the air. Behind them is a narrow stairwell spiraling upward, carved from ivory bone. You climb, heart pounding like a steel drum, and with each step the temperature tilts: one moment you’re bathed in warm candlelight, the next shivering in a spray of neon rain.  

At the top waits a circular chamber hung with dozens of framed photographs. Each frame shows you, but in different roles: witness, instigator, bystander. Their expressions flicker—joy, fear, accusation—before melting into charcoal smudges. You reach for the largest frame and find its glass cool beneath your fingertips. Inside, the scene locks into focus: you, someone else, and a sealed envelope on a table between you. The edges of your memories tremble.  

A gentle voice drifts in, belonging neither to any face you know nor to your own: “What really happened?” The question coils around your mind, drawing you closer to that envelope. You lift the flap, and a warm golden light pours out, promising resolution and truth—but as it floods the chamber, the memory itself dissolves, leaving behind only the weight of uncertainty.  

You kneel and scoop up the scattered photographs, watching them reassemble on the floor like puzzle pieces. Somewhere in their pattern lies the answer that everyone insists you share—yet right now all you feel is the soft throb of not-quite-remembering, and the thrilling ache of a secret still waiting to be found.
