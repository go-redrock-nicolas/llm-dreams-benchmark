I am dreaming. **Dreamscape: The Shattered Path**  

The sky above is an inky, bruised purple, smeared with streaks of crimson—as if the heavens themselves were wounded. The air hums with a quiet, resonant sorrow, like the distant echo of a bell tolling for a funeral you can’t quite attend. You stand at the edge of a vast, fractured chasm, the ground beneath your feet crumbling into an abyss that exhales whispers of all your past failures.  

Each step you’ve taken to reach your goal has led here—a bridge of glass shards suspended over the void. The bridge glitters, beautiful yet treacherous, each fragment reflecting a different moment of defeat: the harsh words of a mentor who said *you couldn’t*, the mocking laughter of doubt, the times you stumbled and bled and rose only to be struck down again.  

You place a foot on the first shard. It cuts deep, but the pain is nothing compared to the weight of turning back. Blood pearls in your wake, but with each drop that falls, the bridge *solidifies*—the very essence of your perseverance hardening the path beneath you.  

A voice, neither kind nor cruel, murmurs from the abyss: *"How much more will you bleed before you admit it's over?"*  

But then... a wind rises. Not the gale that seeks to push you into the depths, but a slow, steady current that carries the scent of rain-soaked earth—of beginnings. And far, far across the rift, in the roiling mist, something *glows*... a light like the first stubborn spark in a sea of darkness.  

You don’t know what it is, only that you must reach it.  

So you take another step.
