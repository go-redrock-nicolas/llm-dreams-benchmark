I am dreaming. The air hums with the electric buzz of neon wires looping through the sky like luminous veins, pulsing with the rhythm of my thoughts. Around me, towers of glass and fractured light stretch endlessly, each pane a flashing screen displaying urgent messages, schematics, and shifting numbers—countdowns ticking down in chaotic unison.  

I stand at the center of a colossal, floating control hub—my fingers dancing over holographic interfaces that multiply with every command, splitting into fractals of sub-tasks, cascading into infinity. Music throbs somewhere in the unseen distance, a symphony of industrial beats and stuttering glitches, syncing with my heartbeat as it races to keep up.  

My left hand drafts a proposal that writes itself in burning letters, dissolving as quickly as they form. My right adjusts the trajectory of a paper airplane fleet carrying critical data—each one swerving erratically, avoiding phantom obstacles barred in deadlines. Meanwhile, equations spiral in my peripheral vision, stitching themselves into incomprehensible formulae that laugh in echoey whispers when I reach to grasp them.  

Below me, a chasm yawns—a dark sea of unfinished tasks, swirling with half-formed documents and discarded prototypes. Shapes move beneath its surface—glimmering fish with watch-face eyes, clock hands for fins, swimming in the deep. They murmur in riddles: *"You're almost there. But where is there?"*  

A sudden jolt—the platforms beneath my feet splinter. Screens flicker into static, then reassemble as a labyrinth of hallways, each stretching forward into recursive variations of the same workspace. A single door appears at the end of one, glowing softly—promising escape, reprieve—but as I sprint toward it, it multiplies, unfolding into more choices, more demands.  

The music swells, distorted. My reflection in the glass walls splits into a hundred versions of myself, each solving a different crisis, each mouth moving in silent urgency.  

Then—silence.  

A warm glow envelops me. I wake up, but not really. The dream resets.  

And I begin again.
