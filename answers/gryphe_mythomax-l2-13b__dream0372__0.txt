I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself standing on the edge of a vast desert, the sun beating down on me mercilessly. As I look ahead, I see an oasis in the distance, shimmering with the promise of refreshment and abundance. 

Suddenly, I feel exhausted and thirsty beyond measure. The dryness in my throat reminds me of the last time I felt this way â€“ when I was operating from a place of scarcity. I remember how I clutched onto every last drop of water, how I hoarded resources instead of sharing and giving freely. 

Taking a deep breath, I vow to shift my mindset to one of abundance. With renewed energy, I set out towards the oasis, each step feeling lighter and more hopeful than the last. Along the way, I notice flowers blooming where there was once only sand, and small pools of water forming in the crevices of rocks. Thedesert is coming alive! 

As I approach the oasis, I am overcome with a sense of awe and gratitude. The water is crystal clear, and the fruit hanging from the trees looks juicy and ripe. The air is thick with the sweet aroma of flowers. 

I see a group of people gathered around a central fountain, laughing and sharing stories. They don't seem to mind my presence, and instead, they welcome me warmly. They offer me food and drink, and soon, I am filled with the joy and contentment that can only come from true abundance. 

I wake up from the dream, my throat still feeling parched, but with a newfound determination to embrace an abundance mindset in all areas of my life.
