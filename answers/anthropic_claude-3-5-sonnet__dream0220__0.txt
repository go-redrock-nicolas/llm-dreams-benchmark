I am dreaming. I find myself wandering through a pastel-hued city where buildings seem to breathe and sway like seaweed in an invisible current. As I make my way down a bustling street, I notice something peculiar about the interactions around me. A woman loudly burps in another's face, and they embrace with tearful joy. A man steps deliberately on someone's toes, and they respond by offering him a gift wrapped in shimmering paper.

My confusion deepens as I enter what appears to be a café, its walls adorned with portraits of people making rude gestures. The patrons speak in interruptions, each person talking over the other with increasing enthusiasm. Those who listen attentively or wait their turn are met with concerned glances and whispered worries about their wellbeing.

I attempt to order a drink, politely waiting my turn. The barista's face falls with disappointment. "Are you unwell?" they ask with genuine concern. When I try to apologize, they become even more distressed. A kind elderly patron takes me aside and explains that in their culture, consideration and patience are seen as signs of disrespect – true love and friendship are expressed through playful disruption and calculated rudeness.

Throughout the dream, I struggle to adapt. I force myself to cut into conversations, deliberately spill drinks on new acquaintances, and arrive hours late to appointments. With each social faux pas (or rather, social success), I'm welcomed more warmly into their community. The dream reaches its climax at a celebration where I'm honored for telling the host their home is hideously decorated – apparently the highest form of endearment in this topsy-turvy world.

The experience leaves me questioning everything I know about social norms, as the dream begins to fade into a watercolor wash of inverted expectations and confused courtesies. Just before waking, I witness a couple's wedding ceremony, where they seal their vows by sticking their tongues out at each other and throwing cake at the guests – the ultimate expression of eternal love.

The whole scene is bathed in an otherworldly light that seems to pulse with the rhythm of unspoken rules being joyfully broken, while the architecture continues its gentle swaying dance against a sky that can't decide if it's dawn or dusk.
