I am dreaming. ---

**You step into a twilight forest where the trees** bleed ink into the sky, staining the air indigo. The path underfoot writhes with serpentine roots, guiding you toward a towering, obsidian gate crowned with thorns. Your lungs tighten—this is the entrance to the gathering. But it shouldn’t be *here*, in this place of whispering shadows. Ahead, dead leaves curl into moth wings, fluttering upward ashy and iridescent, while the ground exhales a hum that vibrates your bones.  

**At the gate, a cloaked figure with no face** offers you a mask—a porcelain raven, its beak cracked. You resist, but your hands move autonomously, tying the strings. The mask adheres like a second skin. Beyond the gate, a courtyard sprawls, filled with guests cloaked in black feathers. Their masks are silver, shaped like crescent moons, but their eyes glow like fireflies. They sway in unison, a chorus of smoke-rasped laughter harmonizing with a distant piano playing backward melodies.  

**You spot a familiar silhouette—a friend?** When you reach out, their body dissolves into crows that burst upward, scattering feathers that melt into confetti. The crowd doesn’t notice. A staircase materializes, twisting into a celestial ziggurat. You climb, each step groaning beneath you, until you stand before an oak door studded with keys. It opens inward, revealing a hall where the ceiling drips liquid constellations.  

**In the center, a table heaves with food that breathes**: peaches pulse like hearts, wine swirls with galaxies, and bread crusts crackle with static. The guests here wear no masks, their faces hollow voids where memories flutter like trapped sparrows. A mirror emerges, reflecting not your masked visage but a child gripping a frayed ribbon—**the last thread of a forgotten birthday party**.  

**Someone whispers**, *"You’re not afraid of them. You’re afraid they’ll see what you’re hiding."* The voice is yours, but deeper, older. Glass shatters. The floor liquefies, and you plunge into a sea of liquid mercury. It molds around you, cold and heavy, until shapes solidify: a sunlit meadow, the same guests now faceless mannequins holding bouquets of thorns. One offers you a rose. Its petals unfold to reveal your own eye, blinking.  

**You wake gasping**, but not truly awake—still dreaming. A crow perches on your windowsill, its beak clasping the cracked raven mask. It drops the mask into your palm, now warm and feather-light. When you press it to your face this time, the cracks glow gold, stitching themselves closed. The dread dissolves. Across the room, the door to the party swings open—blinding light pours in, carrying the scent of rain and old books. You step through.

*The dream lingers, unresolved. But the anxiety? It’s quieter now, nested in the velvet dark of what you chose not to hide.*
