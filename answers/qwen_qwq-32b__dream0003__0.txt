I am dreaming. In my hands lies a box, mysterious and locked. No key is nearby, yet the chest seems to hum with latent energy. The wood, dark and glossy as a raven's wing, is etched with swirling vines and crescent moons that shimmer faintly under some unseen light. My fingertips trace the carvings, and as they do, the designs shiftâ€”now rotating like galaxies, then dissolving into geometric tessellations. A low, resonant tone vibrates through the box, felt more than heard.
