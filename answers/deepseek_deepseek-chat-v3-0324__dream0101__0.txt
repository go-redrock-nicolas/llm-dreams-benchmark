I am dreaming. The first thing I notice is the cold - a sterilized chill that seeps into my bones. The second is the scent - recycled air tinged with something metallic, like copper and ozone. Blinking against the pulsing red emergency lights, I see my hands gripping a railing. My hands, but not really. They’re weathered, calloused, with thin white scars tracing the knuckles. Pilot’s hands. 

Emergency klaxons scream as the ship groans around me, a wounded beast. The holographic display flickers—*WARNING: Quantum Drive Implosion Imminent. 19:35 remaining.* A timer ticks down in my peripheral vision. It’s surreal, but the adrenaline flooding my veins makes it all horrifyingly real. 

Other crew members—faces I *should* recognize—rush past me, shouting in a language that somehow makes sense. A woman with silver tattoos coiled around her neck grabs my arm. "Captain, the core's destabilizing—we need you *now.*" 

And then it hits me: I *know* this ship. I know its shuddering corridors, its failing systems... but it’s like muscle memory, not true knowledge. "Reroute auxiliary power to the dampeners," I bark, surprised at the command in my own voice. 

As I sprint toward engineering, the floor lurches violently. The walls warp, reality itself distorting—for a second, I see *through* the metal, into infinite blackness dotted with dying stars.
