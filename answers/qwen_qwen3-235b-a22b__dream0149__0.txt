I am dreaming. I lie curled on the soft spirals of a bed made of blooming jasmine vines, floating weightless above an ocean of endless mirrors. The sky above pulses and breathes like a living lung, painted in the colors of forgotten emotions—rose-gold sorrow, azure hunger, streaked with threads of smoke-violet longing.

Around me, the dream simmers and swirls in restless potential.

I realize something with the clarity of dawn—my thoughts are not just thoughts anymore. Each one carries gravity. Each sentence I write against the air shapes itself into truth. I stretch my fingers and exhale—a sentence threads into reality like a river shaping stone:

“There is a tree whose leaves are made of music and whose roots hum through the bones of the Earth.”

At once, a structure begins to form at the edge of my vision. Slowly, rising from the mirrored water below, the trunk of a tree ascends—not of bark and fiber, but of cascading sound and syllables. It is tall and impossible, trembling with songs older than history. Its limbs whisper sonnets, and each leaf vibrates with a tone not heard by man—pitches that rouse memory in things that cannot remember. I reach out and pluck a note from the air; it tastes like wind and grief and revelation.

I begin to walk, and each step scribbles existence from my intent.

“A river of liquid starlight winds beneath my feet, and fish with wings swim through the current, their scales reflecting futures yet to happen.”

The ground undulates and shines. The river doesn’t obey gravity as I thought it would; it flows *through* me, and when I wade into it, I feel fragments of my soul being rewritten by the current—old fears dissolving into melodies, fragments of childhood stitched into constellations.

I climb the ribcage of a sleeping god who rests beneath the sky. With each handhold, I name the bone—**Memory**, **Regret**, **Hope**—and with each utterance, a light blooms in the god’s chest. The being stirs faintly, a mountain of flesh dreaming in metaphor. I whisper stories to him, and his heartbeat ripples reality into different shapes: rain falls upwards, then ceases to fall at all, instead hovering in tremulous spheres of liquid clear glass.

Then comes the moment—a thinning of the veil.

Reality begins to writhe under the weight of too many ideas. I have been careless.

I hear a voice, low and velvet, rising from a mass of shifting ink that swirls where the horizon was— 
**“You describe too much… and truth forgets which version of itself was first.”**

It speaks not in malice, but in hunger. The force of infinite potential is now something sentient—awe and annihilation braided together. I feel my consciousness threatening to scatter, my words beginning to unravel their own meaning.

I fall into a sky written overtly thick with desperation. I fall into a dream-within-the-dream where language is outlawed, where every symbol is a shadow of something more dangerous, and I must remember how to *exist* without being able to write.

I do nothing, only breathe, and in that silence—space rebuilds itself with something rawer, something older than words: sensation.

The silence turns into land. Land becomes breath again. And I rest, dreaming deeper.

And then—something shifts.

I wake up—but only halfway. The dream clings to my eyelashes like star-dust and sleep-silver, whispering as it slips into myth: **“You’ll remember how to write the world again, tomorrow.”**
