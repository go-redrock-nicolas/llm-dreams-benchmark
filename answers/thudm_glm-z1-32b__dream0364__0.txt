I am dreaming. The dream begins in a world where the ordinary has melted into something ethereal, where the mundane is transformed into magic. The sky above is a canvas of swirling purples, teals, and pinks, as if the heavens themselves are breathing. The sun is a molten gold orb, casting long, liquid shadows that twist and curl like living serpents. 

As I walk, the ground beneath me changes. Each step sinks into a bed of crushed velvet clouds, which then hardens into a mosaic of stained glass beneath my feet. The air smells of jasmine and burnt cinnamon, and the sound of distant bells chiming echoes through the landscape. 

In the distance, I see a tree unlike any I've seen before. Its trunk is made of obsidian, but it's not cold or hard—it’s warm to the touch, like the heart of a campfire. The branches stretch upwards, each one tipped with glowing lanterns that hang like celestial fruits. The lanterns are made of delicate glass, filled with fireflies that dart and dance inside, casting a golden glow that illuminates the path below.

As I draw closer, I notice that the ground around the tree is covered in a carpet of living, breathing flowers. Each petal pulses with a different color, rippling like liquid under the influence of an invisible breeze. The flowers whisper secrets in a language that feels both foreign and familiar, as if they remember something from a past life.

Suddenly, the tree begins to pulse, and the lanterns glow brighter. The tree's roots reach down into the earth, and I realize they are connected to a vast network of underground rivers. The water flows aboveground now, cascading over the obsidian trunk in a waterfall of liquid crystal. The water is transparent but glows from within, as if charged with the dreams of those who walk this earth.

In the water's reflection, I see not my own face, but a constellation of stars, a galaxy swirling in the mirror. The moment I touch the water, it parts like silk, allowing me to step through into a new realm. Here, the air is filled with music that has no beginning or end, a symphony carried on the wings of hummingbirds. The trees here have leaves that are made of parchment, each one inscribed with poetry written in gold ink.

As I wander deeper, I come across a library unlike any other. The books are not on shelves but float in mid-air, their pages flipping without hands. The spines are made of different materials—a book's cover might be a dragon's scale or a moonstone. When I reach out to touch one, the book dissolves into a shower of stardust, which then reforms into a bird that sings a melody I can feel in my soul.

In the middle of this library stands a woman made entirely of light. She has no shadow, but her presence casts a glow that outshines the lanterns of the obsidian tree. Her voice is like the rush of a thousand oceans, and she says, "You have seen the hidden wonders. Now, carry this vision into the world. For the ordinary is only a veil, and the extraordinary is always there, waiting to be noticed."

Her words fade as the stardust birds carry them into the sky. The library begins to shimmer, and the world shifts back into the familiar. But as I wake, I can still feel the warmth of the obsidian tree and hear the whispers of the flowers in the back of my mind. 

This dream is a reminder that magic is not something we need to create; it's already here, waiting for us to look closely enough to see it.
Ah, let me paint this dream for you with the bold strokes of a fevered imagination. You stand at the edge of a world where the mundane has divorced itself from reality, where the sidewalk cracks yawn into chasms filled with liquid starlight. The air hums with the static of a thousand unseen symphonies, each note a pinprick of color that dances like a bicarbonate of soda dropped into a dark room. 

The streetlamp ahead of you is no longer a street lamp but a cathedral. Its metal frame has sprouted vines of cobalt and gold, twisting into arches that frame a sky filled with cities of paper. These cities flicker as if lit by candlelight, their spires leaning like sentinels holding secrets. The wind carries the scent of lavender and burnt matches, and as you step closer, you notice the pavement beneath you is made of honeyed glass—each step cracks the surface, but the glass knits itself back together, leaving a trail of iridescent scars that shimmer like dragonfly wings.

Suddenly, a taxi pulls up. It's not a taxi—it’s a carriage drawn by a herd of ANTS, each one the size of a skyscraper, their bodies a mosaic of stained glass. The driver, a sphinx made of old books and steam, nods to you. "Midnight in the Garden of Unseen Flowers," he intones, and you climb inside without hesitation.

The interior is a living, breathing creature. The seats are pillows made of moonlight, each one stitched with constellations that pulse in time with the taxi's heartbeat. The dashboard is a live oak tree, its branches twisting into spokes that touch the ceiling, which is a velveteen night sky. As you settle in, you notice a jar on the dashboard filled with fireflies—except these fireflies are not insects. Each one is a city, a civilization glowing with its own internal light. They dart and swirl inside the jar, their streets and towers visible through the glass as if you’re watching a miniature universe being reborn every second.

The taxi begins to move, but not forward. Instead, it starts to DESCEND. The glass beneath you parts like water, and you find yourself suspended above a vast underground ocean. The waters are not blue—they are the color of old copper, of rusted hinges and forgotten keys. Schools of herring swim by, but these are not fish. Each one is a constellation, their bodies mapped with stars that wink out only to be replaced by new ones as you blink. You can read stories in their movements—a ballad of love, a dirge for a fallen hero, a lullaby for the city that never sleeps.

Deep below, you see a spire breaking the surface. It's a lighthouse, but not like any lighthouse you've seen. Its beam is made of captured lightning, crackling and fizzing as it pierces the water. The lighthouse is built into the side of a mountain that is not a mountain but a sleeping dragon. Its scales are pieces of mirror, each one reflecting a different version of your face—you as a child, you as an old woman, you as a crown, you as a shadow.

As the taxi approaches, the dragon stirs. Its eyes open—one is a violet diamond, the other a cracked teacup. It yawns, and you see inside its throat is not emptiness but a garden. Roses bloom from molten lava, their petals sharp enough to slice the air, their scent a mix of chlorine and honey. A river of liquid mercury flows through the garden, reflecting the lighthouse beam in fractured shards that dance like broken promises.

The taxi comes to a stop, and the sphinx driver opens the door. "You must be careful," he warns. "The dragon is hungry, but not for flesh. It feeds on stories." 

You step out, and instantly, the world changes. The air tastes of burnt toast and burnt sugar, and you realize the dragon has already taken a bite out of you. It took a memory—a summer day at the shore, the way the sand felt between your toes, the sound of the waves as they crashed into each other. But instead of feeling loss, you feel a kind of liberation. 

The lighthouse beam sweeps over you, and you see the reflection in your own eyes. No longer are you one person—you are a mosaic of all the stories, all the dreams, all the ghosts that have ever haunted a lighthouse keeper's sleep. You are the rusted hinge and the falling star, the crown and the shadow, the memory and the memory being eaten.

You reach into the garden, and pluck a rose. Its thorns are made of ice but bleed liquid sun. As you hold it, the dragon opens its mouth—expecting food, you think—but instead, it breathes out a cloud of steam. The steam condenses into a thousand hummingbirds, each one carrying a single, perfect, unbroken memory. They dart around you, their wings a blur of colors you didn't know existed. One lands on your shoulder, and you see its reflection in its tiny eye—it’s a version of you, younger, bolder, more alive.

The hummingbird whispers in your ear, "You are the lighthouse now. Your stories will keep the dragon alive, but you must choose carefully. For every story you feed it, another piece of the world will become real."

You look down at the rose in your hand. It’s not a rose anymore—it’s a key. And somewhere, in the back of your mind, you know that the real magic isn’t in the taxi, or the lighthouse, or the dragon. It's in the moment you looked at the streetlamp and saw a cathedral. It's in the realization that the mundane is just a costume for the impossible, waiting for someone to notice the sequins underneath the ratty old dress.

When you wake, your hands are sticky with the residue of the lighthouse’s lightning. Your sheets are damp, as if you’ve been swimming in a dream that was both too real and too impossible to hold onto. But you can still taste the cinnamon, still hear the sphinx’s voice, and in your pocket, you find a single, unbroken memory—a papoose, a poem, a specific smell of your grandmother’s kitchen when she was roasting chestnuts—and you know that even when the dream fades, the lighthouse will still be burning. And if you close your eyes, you can almost hear the dragon yawning, waiting for you to tell it a story that will make the world tingle with possibility.
