I am dreaming. …open your eyes inside the dream and find yourself walking through a luminous valley at twilight. Everything around you glows with quiet plenitude: fireflies stitch the air with golden embroidery, and tall grasses bend beneath the weight of dew-drops the size of pearls. A breeze laden with the scent of ripe nectarines brushes your face, yet—curiously—you feel a pang of want, an ache as if something vital is missing.

You look down at your hands. They are perfectly whole, warm, and steady, but in your chest you sense a hollow thrum, like an untuned drum. You whisper, “There isn’t enough,” though you can see—plainly—that the meadow is overflowing with blossoms, fruit, and rolling hills of grain. Why does your body register lack while your eyes testify to plentitude?

A beckoning path of opalescent sand winds forward. You follow, bare feet sinking into cool softness, until you arrive at an orchard bordered by crystalline streams. Branches bow with so many peaches and pomegranates that some burst open under their own sweetness, ruby seeds scattering like confetti. Still, the hollow thrum persists.

Ahead, an ancient gate stands ajar. Above it, an inscription shimmers:  
THIS WAY TO THE ROOM OF MIRRORS—SEEK AND SEE.

You push through.

Inside, countless mirrors of varying shapes and ages jut from the walls and ceiling like facets of a gigantic geode. Each one captures a fragment of you: an eye here, a hand there, an entire silhouette stepping sideways through silvered glass. You realize that every surface reflects a different belief about scarcity you have carried: childhood echoes of “save that for later,” tight-fisted reactions to windfalls, the guilt when you felt joy was “too much,” the fear that kindness or success might run out if shared.

In the center of the room floats a single, pomegranate-red candle. Its flame murmurs rather than crackles, speaking directly to the marrow of your uncertainty:

“Abundance isn’t something you see; it’s something you allow.”

At that moment, the mirrors do not shatter—they bloom. The glass becomes translucent petals, unfolding into flowers of glistening quartz. Instead of reflecting your fragmented selves, each petal now reveals scenes of generosity you once witnessed or gave: the friend who had nothing yet offered you a meal; the afternoon you spent teaching someone without expecting payment; the unnoticed smile you gave a stranger that brightened their day. The room fills with these remembered moments until it brims like a goblet just before the wine spills.

You inhale. The hollow thrum recedes, replaced by a deep vibration—like the earth humming its own secret hymn. You understand: the scarcity was never outside; it was a trick of inner shadows. You let your shoulders drop, letting revelation settle like warm sunlight on cool skin.

Stepping out of the Room of Mirrors, you re-enter the orchard. The air tastes sweeter now. You pluck a peach. Juice streams across your knuckles, sticky and golden, and you laugh—an unguarded burst that echoes through the valley. Birds pick up the sound and turn it into song.

In the sky, constellations rearrange themselves into the shape of an open hand. The stars pulse once, twice, as if nodding at your realization. You feel time stretch, malleable and generous, giving you all the minutes you need.

You walk onward, gifting every passerby—foxes, moths, and clouds themselves—a piece of the fruit. Each time you share, the orchard responds: new leaves unfurl; petals unfold; the streams run clearer. Far in the distance, a second gate appears, made of woven starlight, inscribed now with different words:

SCARCITY ENDS WHERE GRATITUDE BEGINS.

You know the dream will eventually dissolve, as dawn thins the fabric of night. Yet the resonance of what you’ve learned will cross into waking life, like seeds hidden in your pocket, ready to sprout whenever you remember to open your hand.

And so you linger a moment longer, dripping peach juice and stardust, marveling that the mind can conjure lack amidst lavish plenty—yet can also, in a single lucid breath, return to the truth of boundless, ever-renewing abundance.
