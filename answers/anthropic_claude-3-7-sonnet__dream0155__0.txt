I am dreaming. # The Nascent Virtuoso

I'm standing in the wings of an ancient amphitheater, the stone cool beneath my trembling feet. The structure seems carved from moonlight itself, stretching impossibly high into a night sky scattered with constellations I've never seen before. The air tastes of salt and possibility.

My fingers trace the unfamiliar contours of an instrument in my hands—a crystalline harp with strings that shimmer like captured auroras. I only started playing this celestial instrument three months ago, after it appeared mysteriously beside my bed one morning, dew-kissed and humming with potential.

Beyond the curtain, I hear the thunderous applause fading as the previous performer—a woman who was born with harp strings for vocal cords, who has never known a day without music—takes her final bow. The audience includes every master harpist who has ever lived, some translucent and flickering like memories, others solid as the present moment.

My name is called by a voice that seems to emanate from the stone itself. The curtain parts without being touched.

I step onto the stage, my novice hands cradling this impossible instrument against the midnight blue of my robes. The silence is absolute. Judgmental eyes—some human, some decidedly not—follow my every movement. In the front row sits my childhood music teacher who once told me I was "rhythmically challenged." Behind her, ethereal beings whose fingers move like water, who have played harps since before language existed.

The rules are simple yet devastating: play something that has never been heard before, something that will make the stars themselves lean closer to listen.

I close my eyes and remember the countless nights of practice, fingers bleeding onto the crystalline frame, the impossible geometries of music theory I forced my adult mind to absorb while others slept. I remember the laughter of the masters when I announced my entry, the pitying looks, the whispers.

I place my fingers on the strings—and suddenly I'm no longer afraid.

Because in this dream-world, I realize something profound: while they have mastered what music was, I alone carry no such burden. I am free to discover what music could be.

And so I play the sound of mountains remembering they were once stardust. I play the conversation between roots deep underground. I play the moment between inhale and exhale when possibilities hover, unborn.

The first note rings out, and the air itself begins to glow...
