I am dreaming. The letter arrives on a Tuesday, its envelope an unusual shade of midnight blue with silver filigree that seems to move under my gaze. My name is written in handwriting I should not recognize but somehow do—the loops and curves stirring something primal in my memory.

Inside is a single photograph and a note. The photograph shows a vast library with impossibly high ceilings, books stretching beyond what perspective should allow. Standing in the center is a figure who is unmistakably me, yet decades older, surrounded by people I've never met but whose faces trigger cascades of emotion.

The note reads: "You were never born in Seattle. Your parents are not your parents. The memories you have of childhood are constructs—beautiful fabrications designed to protect you. You are the last keeper of a knowledge that must not die. You've been hiding in plain sight, even from yourself."

Rather than panic washing over me, I feel a profound sense of alignment—as if puzzle pieces scattered throughout my life suddenly snap into place. The inexplicable dreams of flying over ancient stone cities. My ability to understand fragments of conversations in languages I've never studied. The recurring sense that I'm being watched by something benevolent from just beyond perception.

I walk to my bedroom mirror and truly see myself for the first time. My eyes contain depths I've never noticed—tiny specks of gold that seem to form constellations. When I place my hand against the glass, the reflection hesitates for just a moment before matching my movement.

I understand now that I am both less and vastly more than who I believed myself to be. Not diminished by this revelation, but expanded beyond measure, like a book whose pages multiply the moment you think you've reached its end.
