I am dreaming. I slip into sleep like a diver sliding beneath the surface of a silent lake, and suddenly I am walking through a city that seems to have been spun from moonlight and parchment. The streets are traced in silver lines, buildings folded origami-style out of thin rice paper. One careless whisper would send everything fluttering away, yet the whole place feels hushed, weightless, and exquisitely calm—exactly the opposite of the cluttered, overfull life I left behind on my nightstand.

A single bell tolls in the distance—one resonant note that travels across the delicate city and through my chest like a vibration of pure intention. I know what it means without being told: it is time to shed. Time to pare everything down to the core of what matters. I follow the sound.

First I arrive at a great library plaza whose shelves rise like spiraled cathedrals. Thousands of translucent books glow from within, each one bearing a title that corresponds to an obligation, distraction, or possession I have clutched too tightly: “Meeting Notes Nobody Read,” “Shoebox of Cords for Devices Long Dead,” “Guilt Over Unanswered Messages,” “The Argument Replayed at 3 A.M.” The pages rustle, inviting me to pick them up—but my hands are suddenly filled with wind, and I realize I don’t need to open a single volume. I lift my palms, let a slow exhale roll from my lungs, and the entire tower of books ripples into candle-colored embers that float upward and vanish like fireflies. A palpable lightness slips into my shoulders.

The bell tolls again—closer—and I move on.

At the next juncture stands a marketplace built from woven reeds and dawn-colored cloth. Stalls overflow with glittering trinkets: shoes I’ve never worn but kept “just in case,” streaming subscriptions I’ve forgotten to cancel, half-finished hobbies, half-fed anxieties. The vendors bear gentle smiles; they know these wares were once treasures, but they also know the weight they carry. I place a hand over my heart and speak one syllable—“Enough”—and every trinket collapses into petals. A warm breeze sweeps through, lifting the petals skyward until the stalls are empty and quiet. I feel as if I have removed a backpack full of stones I didn’t realize I was wearing.

The third toll of the bell is so near it thrums in my ribs. I find myself on a wide plain of grass as soft and luminous as sea foam. At its center is a single, leafless tree carved from crystal, branches extending like rays of frozen dawn. Dangling from each branch is a translucent sphere, each orb pulsing gently with a scene from my life: the face of a friend, an afternoon spent laughing, the tingle of rain on bare skin, the hush of reading beside a loved one. These are not possessions, not obligations—they are essences, the living marrow of what matters. 

I walk beneath the tree and place my hand on one sphere: it shows my mother smiling across a kitchen table, steam curling from two mugs. The warmth of the memory radiates through me. Another orb holds the feeling of kneeling in the soil to plant seeds that will bloom months later—patience and earth mingled together. I turn slowly, touching each glowing globe, and with every contact a filament of light runs from the memory into my chest, knitting together until a fine, radiant web hums inside me. The rest of the world grows dim; only the crystalline tree and my illuminated heart remain.

A final, softer bell rings—an acknowledgement, not a summons. The tree begins to dissolve into motes of light that swirl around me, filling my lungs with a sensation like cool dew. When the motes settle, the plain is gone, the city is gone, and I stand at the threshold of waking, holding nothing but a single clear note inside me: Stay simple. Hold close what glows. Let everything else rise like paper ash into the wind.

And then dawn streaks across the ceiling of my real-world bedroom, and I wake with hands open, breathing easier than I have in years—lighter, clearer, awake.
