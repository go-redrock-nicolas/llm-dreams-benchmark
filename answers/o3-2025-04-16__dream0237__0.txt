I am dreaming. …decide to walk completely off the script of diplomacy and into the raw fabric of the dream itself.

I stride between the two delegations—a river-streaked people called the Marrow and the sky-tattooed Aeydrin—carrying neither document nor weapon, only a lantern woven from lunar spider-silk. Its light is pale violet, flickering like the last heartbeat of dusk. As I lift it, the floor beneath us gives way to sand that glitters with fragments of shattered hourglasses. Time, the dream whispers, is already broken here, so why keep pretending it’s linear?

I invite both parties to follow me into the fissure that opens beneath the sand. We fall slowly, buoyed by gravity that feels thoughtful rather than forceful, and land in a cavern whose walls pulse like an enormous geode filled with living memories. Crystalline facets project images: centuries-old battles, wedding processions halted by sudden arrows, mothers on each side singing identical lullabies in languages they swear are different.

When they begin shouting—again—I exhale a ribbon of silver breath. It drifts upward, curls into an archway, and turns transparent. “Step through,” I tell them, “but leave your names behind.” Skeptical, yet shackled by curiosity, they cross. Instantly their tattoos and regalia dissolve. They stand nude, ageless, stripped of lineages, grievances, and face-paint. Only their eyes remain distinct—storm-gray for the Marrow, ember-amber for the Aeydrin.

Now the cavern transforms into an inland sea made of ink. Black waves lap at their ankles, carrying drifting lotus petals that glow like bioluminescent runes. I explain: “This sea is story itself. Each petal is a possibility you refuse to imagine.” I ask them to cup their hands and gather petals. As they do, the ink rises, swirling into pillars that sketch potential futures: a joint observatory where both peoples chart comet-paths; a marketplace where Marrow smiths forge sky-steel and Aeydrin glassblowers trap lightning inside crystal; a festival where children trade bone flutes for kite-wings.

But the sea also shows darker roads—scorched villages, perpetual reprisals, fields salted with bitterness. The pillars tremble, forecasting how swiftly hope can collapse back into vendetta. I tell them, “Pick one pillar each—hope or ruin—and pour it into the lantern.” They glance at me, then at each other, knowing that whichever vision they choose will congeal into reality when the dream dissolves.

The Marrow chieftain, whose ancestor’s bones anchor the very word resentment, chooses a hopeful pillar shaped like a bridge stitched from constellations. The Aeydrin matriarch, trembling, chooses the same. They pour the pillars simultaneously. The lantern gulps the visions, flares white, then dims—to a gentle rose glow, a compromise between storm-gray and ember-amber.

Suddenly the sea of ink drains into the lantern, leaving us on a seabed of mirrored glass. Each person now sees their own reflection mingled with that of their opposite—faces hybridizing, eyes swirling into a new color neither gray nor amber but sunrise-brass. The cavern ceiling cracks open; dawn floods in, not from the sun but from the realization that might finally eclipse revenge.

I hand them the lantern. “When you wake,” I say, “break it, and let the joined light loose in the waking world. If you dare.”

The dream begins to evaporate, petals rising like bright smoke, and I float upward through the fissure, the shards of hourglasses reassembling beneath my feet. Time knits itself whole. Behind me I hear no arguments, only the soft chime of glass shaping into possibility. And as the dream folds closed, I realize: the truest reconciliation is not a handshake or a treaty—it is the courage to rewrite the story before the ink dries.
