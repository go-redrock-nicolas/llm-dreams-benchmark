I am dreaming. You find yourself standing amidst a tranquil forest, the soft dappled sunlight filtering through the dense canopy above. The air is fresh and clean, carrying with it the earthy scent of damp soil and fragrant wildflowers. Birdsong fills the air, a symphony of cheerful melodies that dance across the breeze.

As you take a step forward, the foliage beneath your feet crunches softly, each blade of grass and fallen leaf whispering secrets of the forest. You breathe in deeply, the cool air filling your lungs and awakening your senses. Everything around you seems to glow with an ethereal light, as if nature itself is alive and breathing.

Suddenly, a shift in the atmosphere calls your attention. The birdsong starts to quiet, replaced by a growing rumble in the distance. The once-calm sky begins to darken, clouds rolling in at an alarming pace. You can feel the air growing thicker, charged with an unsettling energy.

The wind picks up, rustling the trees into a frantic dance. Leaves begin to swirl around you, their edges turning a fiery red and orange as if kissed by the rising rage coming in from the sky. The once-idyllic forest scene is transforming rapidly, the peaceful ambiance fractured by the approaching storm's force.

You stand there, frozen in place, watching as the sky splits open with a blinding flash of lightning. Thunder crashes so loudly it shakes the very earth beneath your feet. The rain starts to fall, at first in gentle drops, but quickly building into a torrential downpour. Within seconds, you're soaked to the bone, rivulets of water streaming down your face and back.

The storm rages on, branches snapping and whipping around you like angry serpents. You have to shield your eyes and duck your head to protect yourself as the tempest unleashes its full fury. Still, something about it all feels... nice. The energy coursing through you, the raw power of nature on full display. You feel alive, in a way you never have before.

As quickly as it began, the storm starts to abate. The wind dies down, the sky begins to clear, and the once-raging waters recede into a slow, soothing drizzle. The forest around you is drenched and shimmering, transformed by the cleansing storm. A rainbow ares in the newly blue sky, its vibrant colors stretching across the landscape like a beacon of hope.

Yet as you take a step forward, you realize... you're not alone. There, standing a few feet away, is a figure. They appear to be human, but shimmer with an uncanny ethereal light, as if they're not fully of this world. They turn to face you, their eyes gleaming with an otherworldly intelligence. A slow smile spreads across their face, and their voice, hushed yet powerful, whispers in your mind.

"Welcome," they say. "We've been waiting for you."
