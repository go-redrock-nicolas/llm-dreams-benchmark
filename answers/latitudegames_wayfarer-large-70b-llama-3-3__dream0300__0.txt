I am dreaming. My dream unfolds like a vivid painting on the canvas of my mind as I find myself atop a towering cliff, the jagged peak jutting dramatically into the sky. The wind whips around me, tousling my hair and causing my clothes to billow behind me like a cloak. Below, miles of churning ocean waters crash against the rocky shoreline, sending sprays of sea foam high into the air. Fear and thrill surge through me, my heart pounding so loudly I can hear it over the roaring of the wind and waves.

Before me stretches a massive zip line, its steel cable spanning the chasm between my cliff and another distant peak. The harness digs into my flesh as I clip myself to the line, the rough rope feeling like a lifeline between me and the abyss. I take a shuddering breath, feeling the cool ocean air fill my lungs as I prepare to leap.

The pulse-thudding moment of hesitation stretches like elastic time. Then I launch myself from the precipice, the sudden drop in my stomach a sickening lurch. For a moment I'm falling, plummeting towards the unforgiving waters below. The zip line catches me, yanking me forward with bone-jarring force. I whoop with exhilarated terror as I soar through the air like a bird, the landscape a breathtaking blur around me.
