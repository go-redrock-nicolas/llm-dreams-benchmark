I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

You’re perched on the edge of a massive stage that seems to ripple beneath your feet, like a gleaming, black lake reflecting a million trembling lights. Towering screens beam your image across the globe, and the roar of the viewers—a collective gasp of excitement—hangs in the air like electricity before a thunderstorm. You can feel the cameras’ unblinking eyes magnifying every twitch of your limbs, every subtle intake of breath.

It’s almost time to perform, and you can sense the magnitude of your skill pulsing through you. You’ve practiced it endlessly—until it felt carved into your very bones. But now, at the final moment, a whisper of dread slips into your mind: Something’s wrong. There is a jarring incongruity in the shape of the stage, a strange wisp of color in the rafters that doesn’t belong. Your heart tightens.

A single spotlight flickers on, pinpointing you in the dark. The air seems heavier, thick enough to swallow your voice if you try to speak. You look up and see the lighting rig, swaying slightly, as though it were being rattled by some unseen wind. Threads of shadow swirl around it in a disconcerting dance. And then, in a silent second that stretches with freezing clarity, a spark flares high above your head.

That tiny gem of light stabs through your nerves with terror. You imagine the entire structure collapsing onto the stage—lights, steel, cables, all crashing in a horrifying tangle. Your imagination runs wild: brilliant arcs of electricity scorching the air, the deafening clang of metal on metal, screaming fans scrambling for safety. It’s a disastrous vision made all the more ominous by the crowd’s expectant hush.

Yet the countdown begins, those luminous numbers flashing in midair like phantoms. Ten. Nine. Eight. Your pulse drums in your ears. You check your gear, wincing as the harness feels oddly loose. Is it just fear, or did something slip? The cables pulse with electric potential beneath your fingertips. Seven. Six. Your teammates—more like distant silhouettes—nod to you encouragingly from the side, but you can’t hear their voices over that mounting hum of tension. Five. Four. You try to inhale steady, focusing on the move you’ve practiced a thousand times: the leap, the flip, the breathless suspension of time, the thrum of energy that cradles your landing. Three. The hero’s move that every soul—millions riding on future memory—anticipates.

Your vision narrows for a fraction of a heartbeat. The dream is alive around you: The stage floor warps and ripples like a mirage, pulsing with rainbow reflections of your scattered thoughts. Adrenaline is a bright, metallic taste at the back of your tongue. Two. One…

The world surges with an uproar: confetti streams overhead in a shimmering hail, fireworks explode in the rafters—framing that suspicious spark with a violent burst of color—yet somehow it all presses into the corners of your consciousness. Beneath the roar, a single breath of wind caresses your cheek, almost coaxing you forward, only to suddenly whip into a shrieking gale that tears at your clothes. The stage beneath your feet sways, a colossal vessel in a swirling sea of cheers and fear.

In a heartbeat, every eye is upon you. Every camera zooms in. Even from this dream, you feel the pull of countless hearts hoping, waiting. That final doubt throbs behind your eyes: Will the platform hold? Will that stray spark blossom into a storm of sparks? Despite the looming dread, you gather every ounce of courage. You step forward, letting your body remember its hours of practice, letting your spirit push aside the horrors that threaten to unravel your moment.

You leap. The lights intensify, blazing into your eyes. Time slows to a liquid crawl. You’re airborne, suspended over an ocean of astonished faces—startled by your sudden defiance of gravity. Their expressions blur into a pastel swirl of wonder. The rig overhead crackles with electricity as if it, too, is on the moonlit brink of destruction. The audience screams in a collective intake of breath. You flip once, twice, feeling the shift inside your muscles like a cosmic clock ticking off each revolution.

And in that slender slice of time, in this dream that might be madness or magic, you experience a profound calm. Your arms outstretch. You realize you’re far beyond the stage now, drifting under the blazing starlight of a sky that wasn’t there a moment ago. The lights overhead become a constellation, rotating with the slow grace of galaxies. The fear evaporates like mist under the brilliance of this cosmic wonder. For a timeless instant, you float.

Then gravity reclaims you, and you plummet softly, softly, landing with a sureness you never expected. The thunder of the crowd washes over your ears in a wave of ecstatic relief, voices rising into a swirling chant of triumph. Amid the shower of flickering confetti, you realize that despite the danger, despite the looming possibility of disaster, you have made it. Whole, victorious, breath shuddering with adrenaline—and though you remain uncertain if the rig overhead will collapse, that sparkle of terror remains a faint star, overshadowed by your own radiance.

You stand, hands trembling with remnants of flight, as dream meets reality in the roar of the applause. The taste of stardust lingers on your tongue, and the world pulses awake around you in a blaze of color. You have performed your skill under a cosmic hush of danger and awe. And even now, the memory of that single spark flickering in the shadows dances at the edge of your mind, daring you to wake before the dream can fade…
