I am dreaming. I drift first through a sky the color of bruised grapes, each cloud rippling like silk. Below me lies an impossibly vast camp of canvas and corrugated metal: tents pitched in perfect, quivering rows that stretch toward a horizon of dusty mountains. Lantern light flickers inside every shelter, casting pinpricks of hope against the encroaching dusk.

I realize I am the coordinator here—the pivot on whose shoulders the lives of thousands tilt. In my hand is a translucent tablet etched with shifting maps: rivers that glow in sapphire blue, villages outlined in ember red. I trace a trembling finger over curves of the land. One valley, far to the east, is home to families with nothing but the clothes on their backs; in the north, an aging pumping station gurgles weakly, the only source of safe water for a settlement twice their size.

The camp around me breathes with urgency. Children run through the corridors between tents, their laughter brittle but bright. Their feet stir up clouds of dust that dance like motes of gold in the lantern glow. I call out names in a dozen languages at once; my own voice echoes back, warped as though spoken in a deep well. Aid workers circle me, their faces masks of exhaustion and resolve. They hold clipboards that dissolve into pools of color as I reach for them—each form representing sacks of grain, cans of oil, blankets spun from coarse wool.

A sudden tremor through the ground startles me. The tents ripple as if taken by a colossal wave. For a moment, time fractures. I fall sideways into the earth, landing on a floor of living mosaic—tiny tiles that pulse beneath my feet, each one a person’s life: a mother with an infant, an elder clutching a rusted tin cup, a youth with hollow eyes. Their stories flicker across the tiles in bursts of memory: laughter, tears, starvation, hope.

I scramble back to my feet and the camp reassembles around me. Two convoys stand ready on opposite flanks: one loaded with jerrycans of water, the other with stacked crates of fortified biscuits. Both convoys demand my single authorization code. I feel the enormity of that choice cling to my chest like lead. In the distance, the silhouette of a storm coils over the mountains, thunder rolling through the valley. If I send water east, the storm will wash away the road north—and the biscuits will never arrive. If I send the biscuits first, the settlements edging toward dehydration will collapse long before the nourishment arrives.

In the hush that follows, a silent council forms at my side: a medic with gentle eyes, a logistics officer whose uniform is smeared with paint, a translator whose tongue slips between dialects like a song. They bend near me, offering advice, but in dreams, advice is both gift and burden. I inhale the thick, sweet air—an aroma of scorched earth and jasmine. Then I lift my hand and place the golden pen against the tablet. It hums with warmth at my touch.

“Divide and trust,” I murmur, and watch the routes redraw themselves in glowing tracery. The water convoy will skirt the ridge, reaching the parched valley in half the time; the biscuit convoy will thread through the orchard groves, where makeshift causeways hold firm even under torrential rain. In that instant, the crates themselves shimmer: the biscuits turn pale as dove’s wings, the jerrycans glow like captured moonlight.

Far overhead, crows wheel in a mournful dance. I call to them; they fold their wings and alight on my shoulders, transforming in their shadows into nurses and drivers, all ready to carry out the plan. Their eyes burn with purpose, and they vanish into the night, each one a promise.

As I watch them go, the lanterns around the camp flare into a thousand tiny suns. Faces lift toward the light—some hopeful, some fearful, all watching. I stand alone in the center, heart pounding so loudly it drowns out the wind. Then the sky opens, and a single white dove glides down to rest on my outstretched hand. Its eyes meet mine, unwavering. In the hush that follows, I understand: even a dream can carry the weight of real hope.
