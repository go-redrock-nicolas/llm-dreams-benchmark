I am dreaming. …find myself standing in a vast, crimson-lit atrium that seems to pulse with expectation. The marble floor beneath my feet shimmers with reflections that twist into unfamiliar patterns. All around me, countless doors open and close silently, each one promising a thousand possibilities and dangers. My hands clutch a clipboard, but the pages are fluid—words and diagrams swim and reshuffle of their own accord.

As I scan the space, ethereal shapes flicker at the edge of my vision, whispering the names of forgotten tasks: the chandelier’s candles burning too quickly; the orchestra warming up with discordant, echoing notes; tables set with plates that melt into puddles of silver under the weight of anxious gazes. Every detail I try to correct frays further—flowers wilt while I arrange them, invitations send themselves spiraling into the air, scattering like startled birds.

A sudden hush sweeps over the atrium. Shadowy figures in fine, impossible costumes begin to gather, their eyes luminous with anticipation and a hint of menace. My heart kicks up its tempo. The event, I realize, is a negotiation of worlds—a summit between realms that rarely touch. Whispered edicts swirl in the air: if I fail, these worlds might unravel, their borders crumbling into oblivion.

Time bends and slips as I run from crisis to crisis. Each step I take seems to multiply the distance between one task and the next. My voice evaporates when I try to shout instructions. I glance at the shining clock on the far end of the hall—its hands spin far too quickly. Every mistake, every unraveling seam, amplifies the tension, warping the air itself.

Just as panic is about to swallow me, I remember a phrase, inscribed in gold on the back of my shifting clipboard: “Trust the heart of the labyrinth.” I close my eyes, let the swirl of chaos and possibility sweep around me, and take a slow, deliberate breath.

When I open my eyes again, the chaos has become a dance. The fraying details knit themselves together, woven by the hands of the very guests I once feared. Each wrong note, melted plate, and scattered invitation finds its place in a wild, unanticipated harmony. The boundaries between catastrophe and creativity dissolve. I realize: the event was never meant to be perfect. Its beauty lies in its uncertainty—in the strange, collective magic of shared hope and risk.

As the dream fades, I feel the lingering electric thrill of possibility—a shimmering aftertaste of the world I shaped and saved in the deepest folds of my sleeping mind.
