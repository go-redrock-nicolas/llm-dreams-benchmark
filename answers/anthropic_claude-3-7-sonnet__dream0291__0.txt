I am dreaming. After experiencing repeated hardships, I notice my perspective shifting toward persistent negativity. Becoming aware of this pessimistic outlook, I find myself standing at the edge of an obsidian shoreline, where waters of deep indigo lap against the volcanic sand. The sky above me churns with clouds that appear to be made of shifting watercolor—violets bleeding into stormy blues and ash grays.

I realize I'm holding something—a small lantern with a curiously resilient flame that flickers but never extinguishes, even as the salty wind gusts around me. Each time the negativity threatens to overwhelm me, the flame pulses brighter, casting warm light across my hands.

Suddenly, the beach begins to transform. With each wave that retreats, it leaves behind not just water marks but tiny, luminescent seeds embedded in the dark sand. As I walk barefoot along the shore, my footprints cause these seeds to germinate instantly, sprouting into crystalline flowers that chime softly when they touch one another.

An elderly figure appears beside me, seemingly woven from mist and starlight. Without speaking, they gesture toward a path that winds up from the beach into a forest where the trees have bark of hammered copper and leaves of thin jade. I understand somehow that this is a journey through my own consciousness, each step a choice between remaining in the familiar darkness or moving toward something unknown but potentially transformative.

As I follow the path, carrying my resilient flame, the negative thoughts trail behind me like shadows—but they no longer feel like they're mine to carry. They're simply observations passing through, clouds across the vast sky of my awareness.
