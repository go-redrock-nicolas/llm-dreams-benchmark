I am dreaming. The air thrums with a sonorous hum, your bones vibrating like tuning forks as the velvet curtain lifts. A symphony of wrongness engulfs you—first the scent of burnt honey and freezing rain, then the realization that you’ve rehearsed *entirely* the wrong lines. The script in your trembling hands isn’t written in ink but in flickering bioluminescent symbols, their shapes shifting like eels under moonlight. The orchestra pit glows an unnatural violet, cellos groaning like ancient beasts, their bows strung with strands of starlight.  

Beneath your feet, the stageboards creak like ice cracking over a fathomless lake. Your costume—supposedly a sequined gown—feels like living armor, scales slithering against your skin, whispering forgotten dialects. The audience’s faces are blurred into shimmering smudges, their eyes voids of liquid obsidian reflecting your disarray. When you open your mouth to speak, your voice isn’t yours: it’s layered, harmonizing with a chorus of versions of you from other timelines—a warrior queen, a weeping child, a creature with moth wings.  

The spotlight sharpens. Suddenly, your body moves autonomously, executing choreography you never learned. You leap, limbs carving sigils in the air that linger like smoke. The script disintegrates into sand, each grain a memory—your childhood piano teacher’s withering sigh, the smell of backstage lilacs, the tremor in your hands before your first audition. Audience shadows stretch toward you, elongated and hungry, as the theater’s walls dissolve into a starless void.  

Then, silence.  

A single silver thread materializes from your sternum, pulling taut toward a figure in the front row—a version of yourself in a crown of fractured mirrors. She smiles, and the dream fissures.  

You wake, not to your bed, but to the scent of rain-soaked earth, your palms clutching a handful of glowing sand.
