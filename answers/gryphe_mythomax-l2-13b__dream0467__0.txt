I am dreaming. In my dream, I am walking through a vast, lush forest. The ground is soft, and the air is thick with the sweet scent of wildflowers. As I continue down the path, I come across a crystal clear stream. The water is so pure and refreshing that I can't resist taking a dip. As soon as I enter the water, the rest of the world fades away, and I am enveloped by a sense of tranquility.

Suddenly, I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn around to see a magnificent white stallion standing behind me. Its eyes are deep pools of wisdom, and its mane shimmers in the sunlight. Without a word, it beckons for me to follow it. 

As I walk alongside the stallion, I notice how gracefully it moves about the forest. Its every step is deliberate and confident, yet it never tramples on the delicate flora around us. It teaches me that just because we have the power to do something, it doesn't mean we should. We must always tread lightly and respect the natural balance of our surroundings.

Eventually, the stallion leads me to a clearing in the forest. In the center of the clearing is a large stone pedestal, and on top of it sits an exquisite golden apple. As soon as I see the apple, I understand its significanceâ€”it represents the ultimate combination of beauty and wisdom.

The stallion nods at me, and I take the apple in my hands. It feels warm and vibrant, pulsating with energy. I feel a weight lift off my shoulders as I accept the apple's gift. With newfound wisdom and confidence, I know that I can navigate through life with grace and kindness, always maintaining clear boundaries while connecting deeply with others.

As I wake up from the dream, I realize that maintaining clear boundaries is not about creating distance but rather creating the space for deeper connection and understanding. With this lesson in mind, I am ready to face whatever challenges come my way.
