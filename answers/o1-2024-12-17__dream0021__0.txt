I am dreaming. …take a deep breath. You feel your lungs expand, but the air tastes sweeter than normal, sparking a faint tingle in the back of your throat. When you exhale, the world seems to shimmer, pulsing like a living tapestry of color. Around you, the roars and cheers of the crowd form a swirling storm of sound. You’ve never heard such applause in real life—each clap echoes with the metallic ring of distant thunder, each cheer hovers on the edge of the wind like confetti caught in an updraft.

The sky overhead isn’t just sky; it’s a massive dome made of transparent crystal, refracting streams of prismatic light across the arena floor. It’s day and night at once—brilliant golden beams slice through the gloom, while a constellation of neon stars twinkles in the corners of your vision. Below, the stadium’s ground is not made of grass or dirt but rather blocks of silver, each shaped like a puzzle piece, interlocking underfoot in an endless mosaic. Your footsteps ring out as if you’re walking on ancient metal, a subtle hum that resonates in your bones.

At the center lies an enormous dais, shimmering and rotating like a grand stage elevated for the moment of truth. Your opponents stand on its edge, exuding power, cloaked in fluttering, opalescent fabrics that stretch behind them like phantom wings. Their faces, etched with confidence, reflect in the gleaming surface below. You’ve watched them for years, studied their every move, memorized their cunning strategies, and yet, seeing them in person is different. Each one has an air of gravitas forged by countless victories, and you can feel your heart pounding faster, echoing a million thoughts all tangled at once.

But now, all eyes have shifted to you—like a single, collective gaze. It feels as if the entire stadium tilts, spotlight funneling onto your very soul. The world hushes for a moment, the roars muting, and even your breathing sounds thunderous in your own ears. Even though you feel your knees quiver, a fierce determination starts glowing in the pit of your stomach, like an ember blazing into a flame. You can sense your teammates in the stands, brimming with hope and belief. A sudden breeze rustles your clothing, a promise carried on the wind, reminding you that you earned this moment.

In this surreal dream-space, your body feels weightless yet impossibly strong. The air around you thrums with anticipation and raw possibility. You step forward toward the rotating dais, and with every stride, the silver tiles beneath your feet hum brighter, lighting up your path. The opponents raise their heads in unison, acknowledging your arrival with an almost respectful silence.

You lock eyes with them, the dream’s color-saturated swirl intensifying, your heartbeat drumming an anthem of defiance and courage. You’ve been chosen for a reason, after all—some spark of brilliance the world has yet to see. With a final breath, you set your stance. The cosmic hush of the arena crushes the air. The competition is about to begin, and in this moment, you are more alive than ever before, poised at the edge of destiny with an entire dreamscape holding its breath just for you.
