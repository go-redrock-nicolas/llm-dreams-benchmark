I am dreaming. **Dreamscape of the Whispering Storm**  

You stand in a clearing where the sky is an oil painting of bruised violets and sulfur-yellow streaks, as though the atmosphere itself is wounded. A storm thrums in the distance—not of rain, but of fractured clock gears and hummingbird wings, swirling in a cyclone that devours time. Your breath hitches; the air tastes metallic, like licking a battery. This is a crisis you cannot name, a dread that gnaws at the marrow of your bones. You’ve dissolved into fragments, your thoughts scattering like ash, and you know, with visceral certainty, that you cannot piece yourself back together alone.  

You turn to the figures around you—friends, family, strangers whose faces flicker like static. But when you open your mouth to scream, the sound drowns in the roaring wind. Their eyes hollow into voids, pupils expanding into inkblots that leak down their cheeks. Their hands stretch into skeletal branches, reaching not to pull you close but to **pluck feathers from your spine**. One by one, they take turns whispering secrets you’ve buried: *“You’ll always be alone,”* hisses your mother’s shadow, her voice the creak of a coffin hinge. *“Your heart is a begging bowl,”* murmurs a lover’s ghost, his lips dissolving into moths.  

The ground liquefies beneath you, becoming a mirror-dark lake. Your reflection grins, sharp-toothed and feral, as you sink. But then—a pulse. A low, resonant thrumming, like a heartbeat from the earth’s core. From the storm’s eye emerges a creature: part wolf, part wildfire, its fur rippling with bioluminescent vines. It doesn’t speak, but its gaze is a furnace that sears away the cold. *Follow*, it seems to say.  

You crawl toward it, the lake splintering into a mosaic of forgotten memories—your first heartbreak, the day you stopped trusting joy, the nights you muffled your weeping in pillowcases. The wolf leads you through a labyrinth of weeping willows, their leaves scribbled with half-formed apologies. At the maze’s center stands a doorframe veiled in spider silk. Beyond it lies a meadow where the grass sings in polyphonic harmonies, and the sky is stitched with constellations shaped like your initials.  

The wolf nudges you forward. You step through, and the door vanishes. The storm still rages, but now you hold a key wrought from your own breath, glowing like a captured star. The crisis isn’t gone—it coils around your ankles, a serpent made of smoke—but you understand now. The others couldn’t save you because they were never the custodians of your wholeness. You inhale, and the key melts into your palm, reforging your spine feather by feather.  

You wake, saltwater pooling in your collarbones, the dream’s resonance humming in your ribs. Some storms are not meant to be weathered together. They are solo voyages through the galaxy of your scars, where survival becomes a psalm you write with your own teeth.
