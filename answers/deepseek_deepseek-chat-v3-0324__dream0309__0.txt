I am dreaming. The world around me is awash in hues of twilight—indigo bleeding into molten gold, as if the sky itself has been smeared with the remnants of old paintings. The air shimmers with a faint, whispering hum, like the distant echo of a melody half-remembered. Underfoot, the ground doesn’t quite feel solid; every step sends ripples through the earth as though I’m walking on liquid shadows.  

Then, *it* appears—a figure woven from silver mist and shifting light. Its voice is the rustle of dry leaves, the creak of ancient doors.  

*"You think it was all you?"* it murmurs, tilting its head. *"Every victory, every step forward? What if the winds simply favored you? What if the universe tilted its hand and placed the pieces in your path?"*  

My chest tightens. A cold brush of doubt slithers down my spine. The landscape shifts—suddenly, I'm standing on a towering cliff, a vast chessboard stretching into infinity below me. The pieces are lives, chances, choices. Some of them glow with stolen light, pulsing in erratic rhythms.  

*"See?"* the whisper comes again. *"Look closer."*  

And I do. I see moments—times when a single breath of chance saved me. A stranger’s kindness that opened a door. An accident, a coincidence, a lucky break. The chessboard flickers, rearranging itself in infinite variations—versions of my life where luck turned its back.  

A hot surge of defiance rises in me. My hands clench. *No.* I won't accept it. Not like this.  

I turn to the specter, my voice firm now.  
*"Maybe luck set the stage,"* I admit, *but I walked onto it. I chose to fight. I chose to rise when I fell."*  

The misty figure hesitates. Then, slowly, it dissolves—its particles scattering into indigo and gold, dissolving into the dream as if it had never been. The chessboard beneath me hardens into solid ground.  

I wake with the scent of rain in the air, my pulse steady, my resolve unshaken.  

Luck may play its games, but the fire in my lungs? The grit in my bones? That was always mine.
