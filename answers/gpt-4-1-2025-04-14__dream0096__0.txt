I am dreaming. 

The world around me shivers with unreality—my surroundings flicker and fade between shadows and lurid, smearing colors, as if the edges of existence itself are dissolving. I find myself standing in the narrowest of corridors, its walls slick with condensation, the light above me pulsing a sickly, flickering yellow. Every step I take, the floor beneath my feet creaks and groans, vibrating with a hollow, anxious sound that beats in time with my suddenly racing heart.

Ahead, the corridor impossibly shrinks and warps, stretching away into a chasm of darkness. An unnameable dread roots itself in my chest: I am afraid of being trapped, of the world closing in so tightly that there is no space in which to breathe—a suffocating, inescapable confinement.

As I walk, the walls slide closer, groaning with malice. My chest tightens; I reach out to touch the slick walls, but my fingers pass straight through, meeting only cold emptiness. Suddenly, the ceiling begins to descend, inch by inch, whispering threats I can almost hear but not quite decipher. Shadows flicker in my peripheral vision, darting between the thinning cracks of light. Every primal instinct screams for escape, but the corridor stretches on and on, a nightmare with no end.

Panic crackles up my spine, threatening to consume all sense and reason. The air grows thin, every breath a struggle. My greatest fear has taken shape—being utterly trapped, powerless, with reality pressing in from all directions.

But then, in that feverish moment between collapse and surrender, I notice a pinprick of silvery light at the seam where corridor meets ceiling. I force myself to focus, fighting the thick fog of fear. The light pulses, strange and steady, and I realize with sudden clarity that I am dreaming—that this is not the end, not truly, but a doorway born from my own mind.

A flood of lucidity rushes through me. With trembling determination, I raise my hands—and the walls, the ceiling, the entire cage of fear dissolve into mist. The silvery light expands, warming me and painting everything in hopeful glow. The space blossoms around me into an open field, the sky endless above, breathing is easy again.

Where fear reigned, courage and creativity bloom. I am limitless. The nightmare is over—and in its place, the exhilarating freedom of imagination stretches as far as my dream-self can see.
