I am dreaming. **The Forgotten Hourglass**  

The moment you open your eyes, the world is different—soft, golden, and alive in ways you’ve never seen. The air hums with the scent of damp earth and hearth-smoke, carrying whispers of a time long past. Above you, the sky is a tapestry of indigo bleeding into dawn, and constellations you don’t recognize pulse like fading embers.  

You rise from a bed of wild grass, your limbs wrapped in rough-spun linen. Around you, the landscape is neither medieval nor ancient but something else entirely—a place outside of time. The trees twist like ink strokes, their bark shimmering with veins of silver. A river nearby runs backward, singing quietly as it defies nature.  

Then you notice the shadow.  

At first, it’s just a flicker—a silhouette moving against the wind. But soon, it takes shape: a cloaked figure standing at the edge of the forest, watching you. Their face is hidden, but their outstretched hand holds an object—an ornate hourglass filled with swirling black sand.  

A voice, neither male nor female but melodious and deep, resonates in your mind. *"You must fix what was broken."*  

And then the truth strikes you like lightning—this isn’t just a dream. You’ve slipped between the cracks of time itself.  

As you step forward, the ground trembles. The river’s backward current quickens. The trees shudder as if in warning. And when you reach for the hourglass, the figure vanishes, leaving only one thing behind—a silver key resting in the soil, glowing faintly like a trapped star.  

Somewhere in the distance, a clock tower chimes—a sound from a city that doesn’t exist yet. Or one thatDreaming in the Age of Lost Echoes  

You blink awake—not to an alarm, not to sunlight, but to the slow, rhythmic drip of water falling somewhere in the darkness. The air is thick with the scent of ancient paper and candle wax that hasn’t been burned in centuries. When your fingers brush the ground, it’s not grass or soil but cool, polished marble, etched with runes that seem to rearrange themselves under your touch.  

A city rises around you—not ruined, not new, but paused. Towers of glass and white stone stretch endlessly upward, their peaks dissolving into a sky that isn’t sky at all, but a shimmering veil of liquid silver, like mercury held in place by some unseen hand. Bridges curl between buildings like frozen ribbons, and everywhere, there are books. Books floating midair, books stacked into precarious sculptures, books embedded into the walls like fossils.  

A whisper snakes through the silence: *"Find the ink that isn’t ink."*  

You stand, and your reflection glides across the marble—except it doesn’t move when you do. It stares back at you with eyes too old for your face, then lifts a finger to its lips. *Shhh.*  

The first door you try is locked, but the lock is a hollow orb filled with swirling smoke. When you press your palm to it, the smoke forms a single word: **"Remember."**  

Somewhere above, a great clock strikes, but the sound is wrong—it unravels in reverse, each toll pulling backward into silence. As the last echo fades, the city exhales, and the books begin to fall.  

You run.  

(Do you reach for the nearest glowing page? Do you chase the fading reflection in the marble? Or do you stand still and let the dream rewrite itself around you?)
