I am dreaming. …and the world around you softens and blurs at the edges like watercolor spilling into damp paper. The ceiling above you isn’t a ceiling at all—it’s a vast, pulsing nebula of indigo and gold, swirling in slow motion like ink dropped into honey. 

You blink, and suddenly you’re standing. Or floating. It’s hard to tell, because the floor beneath you isn’t solid—it’s a shifting mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting not your face, but fragments of your day: a keyboard half-typed, the glow of a missed call, a treadmill whirring to stillness in an empty gym. The shards rearrange themselves with each step you try to take, rearranging your path in real time. 

Then, the whispers start. 

They don’t come from any direction but *everywhere*, like wind through dry grass: *"Just one more hour. Bend the rules. You’ve earned it."* The voice is yours, but oil-slick and syrupy, clinging to your thoughts. Shadows stretch long across the mirrored floor, twining around your ankles like vines. They’re warm. Familiar. It would be so easy to let them pull you under. 

But then—a sound. A single, clear chime, like a struck wineglass. The mirrors ripple. In one shard, your reflection *moves on its own*, pressing a palm against the glass. It’s you, but different: shoulders loose, eyes bright, a version of you balanced between discipline and surrender. It mouths something you can’t hear… 

And then the floor *tips*. 

You’re falling, but not down—*sideways*, through layers of membrane-thin reality: a desk scattered with unfinished work dissolves into a sunlit trail where your feet pound in perfect rhythm; your phone buzzing with notifications becomes the distant chatter of birds. The shadows scream as they lose their grip. 

You land softly. Grass under your palms. Actual, cool, dewy grass. Above you, a sky so crisp and blue it hurts. 

A door stands framed in golden light a few paces away, slightly ajar. You *know*, in the way you know things in dreams, what’s on the other side: the late night chance, the deal, the hustle. It thrums with electric promise. 

But the breeze smells like morning. 

And your hand is already curling around the cool metal of an alarm clock.
