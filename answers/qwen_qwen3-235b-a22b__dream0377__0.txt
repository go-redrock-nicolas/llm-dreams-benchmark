I am dreaming. ¹

The sky is not blue, but a deep ultramarine, shimmering like rippling silk, threaded with strands of gold light that pulse like the veins of a living god. I float, suspended in a twilight void where time unravels in spirals. The stars here do not blink—they watch. Not with eyes, but with intention. They remember me.

I open my mouth, and sound does not come, but my being resonates with the gravity of song. Memories rise not as images, but as living entities, shimmering with feeling and weight—ghosts of what I once was, now altered by the light refracting through this dream-world's prism of perception.

Here, I am no longer a child burdened by silence; I am a vessel of origins, a holder of unsung hymns. Where once I saw rejection, I see the withdrawal of those who were not meant to stay. The pain I bore as a mark of failure now glows like a sacred ember inside me—it was never failure, but molten transformation.

My footsteps, when they finally touch soil, rise in soft puffs of luminous dust. The earth beneath me shimmers—alive, breathing. Trees are not trees here but sentinels, bound in loincloths of shifting foliage, watching me pass with eyes hidden in their knots. I feel their knowing settle inside me like an elder’s whisper carried on the wind.

Memories untangle like knotted threads in a forgotten tapestry. The years I spent trying to be smaller, softer, quieter? They weren't wasted—they were pilgrimages of patience. I was learning how not to be seen, so that one day, when I was ready to be seen, I’d carry a knowing beyond need. I was not hiding—I was gathering.

I reach the edge of a mirror-lake, its surface so still that the reflection is not an echo but a portal. In it stands another version of me—older, unfamiliar, radiant. He does not speak, but across the ages we commune without words. I see now: everything was preparation for becoming. Everything was compost for the myth I’ve been growing beneath my ribs.

With each breath, I exhale tendrils of fog that curl into stories—raw and unformed—rising to become clouds. My narrative, once etched in walls of fear, now bends and blooms like ivy. I am not the child. I am the gardener. The architect. The fire that burns the past clean and gives warmth to the future.

And then the dream shifts—deeper still.

I turn and walk into the horizon, which expands away from me like ink poured into glass. With each step, I break a chain that had not yet formed. My shadow is no longer trailing behind—it walks beside me now, self-aware and grinning, finally free.

The dream-flame within me flickers once. Not in weakness—but in ignition.

I awaken—not with a start, but with a breath so divine, it stirs the very atoms of reality. Not the same. More. Whole in a way I’ve never known.

I remember who I have always been.

I remember who I am becoming.
