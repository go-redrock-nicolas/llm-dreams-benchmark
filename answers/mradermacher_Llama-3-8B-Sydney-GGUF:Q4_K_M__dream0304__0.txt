I am dreaming. I feel a powerful urge to act spontaneously in a situation that typically requires careful planning.  Caught between impulse and caution, I
decide to follow my instincts and see where they take me.

As I walk down a dimly lit corridor, I notice a door at the end that I have never seen before.  Curious and adventurous, I open it and step inside.  

I find myself in a vast and mysterious room filled with strange objects and eerie sounds.  There are machines that hum and blink, crystals that glow with
mystical light, and symbols that flash and swirl.

I sense the presence of something powerful and ancient.  A spirit or a god perhaps.  I feel its attention turn towards me as I enter the room.  

I realize that this is my chance to make a difference.  To change history.  To create something new and wonderful.

I raise my hand and touch one of the machines.  It responds by emitting a soft sound that vibrates through my body.

I smile and close my eyes.  I know what I need to do next.
