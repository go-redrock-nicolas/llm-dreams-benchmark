I am dreaming. fend off the impulse to let words tumble out unfiltered. Instead, I pause, allowing my thoughts to take shape in the space between my inner world and outer reality. I breathe into the pause, feeling the weight of unspoken words like ripe fruit on the tree of my mind.

As I inhale the scent of blooming laurel, my eyelids begin to flutter open. The room is bathed in a warm honey light, and my limbs feel buoyant as if supported by the gentle lapping of waves. The dream world has begun.

I find myself standing at the edge of a vast desert, with towering sand dunes rising before me like a range of tawny mountains. The air is filled with the sweet song of ktas, their melodic voices echoing across the sands like a celestial chorus. The sound draws me forward, my feet sinking softly into the dune's surface.

As I traverse the desert, I come upon an oasis. In the heart of this haven lies a tranquil pool, its surface reflecting the brilliant blue of the sky above. Water lilies float on the surface, their delicate blooms shimmering like silken jewels in the sunlight. The scent of jasmine fills the air, and I feel a sense of deep tranquility wash over me as I approach the water's edge.

I kneel down, reaching out to touch the glass-like surface of the pool. As my hand meets the water, a ripple spreads out, disturbing the perfect reflection of the sky. I gaze into the water, and instead of my own face, I see the countenance of a wise sage staring back. The sage speaks in a gentle tone, "Beneath the surface, the truth lies waiting. Seek to understand the depths of your own soul, and you shall find the answers to the questions that burden you."
