I am dreaming. dream into the depths of your magnificent mind: You're standing on the edge of a cliff, gazing out across a vast plains. But this isn't just any cliff… it's perched atop a majestic dragon, its scales glinting in the golden sunlight. The dragon's wings stretch out beneath you, quivering as it takes to the sky. Together, you soar over checkered fields and coral reefs, the horizon curving with your imagination.

In the distance, a shimmering palace appears, its crystal spires reaching for the stars. The dragon takes you in a swift circle around the palace before depositing you in a grand hall, where a group of people in flowing robes await. Their leader steps forward, holding an ornate box and you open, revealing a delicate wooden box within. They challenge you to solve their impossible puzzle – and the fate of their kingdom magically depends on it!

Will you accept the challenge? What happens next? Your imagination knows no boundaries in this brilliant dream world, where starlight, mythical creatures, and realms of wonder await your touch. Dazzling and enchanting, you float through these actively articulated adventures you've conjured into being. The labyrinth of your mind creates the path before you, a path of winding through the intricate cyclic tendrils of the dueling characters, each acting and reacting to create masterful threads.
