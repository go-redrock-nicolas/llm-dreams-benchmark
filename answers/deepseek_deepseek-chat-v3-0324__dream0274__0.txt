I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Shattered Mirror**  

You stand at the edge of an immense, opulent ballroom, its vaulted ceiling adorned with constellations that pulse like slow-beating hearts. The air hums with anticipation, thick with the scent of burning incense and something sweet—vanilla and lightning, perhaps. Around you, figures draped in silken shadows murmur your name like a sacred incantation. You’re moments away from stepping onto a dais where a crown of liquid gold hovers, awaiting your brow.  

Then—a sound. A whisper at first, then a voice you know too well—**your own.**  

*"Do you even deserve this?"* it asks, not unkindly, but with the awful clarity of truth.  

The walls ripple. The constellations blink out, one by one. The crown trembles, its molten surface fracturing into a thousand shards. From the cracks spills not gold, but water—no, ink. It spreads like veins across the marble floor, and when it reaches your feet, the reflection looking back at you isn’t yours. Not anymore.  

Your mirror-self grins with teeth like splintered glass.  

*"What if all of this is just borrowed?”* it murmurs. *"What if the moment they see you—*really *see you—they’ll know you’re a fraud?"*  

The ballroom darkens. The applause curdles into silence. The weight of the unseen crown now feels like an executioner’s blade.  

And just as you’re about to wake—skin damp, heart galloping—the dream offers one last cruelty:  

*"But what if you take it anyway?"*
