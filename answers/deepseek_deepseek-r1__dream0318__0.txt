I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**  
You stand in a cathedral of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a different version of yourself—hero, villain, lover, martyr—each lie you’ve ever spun crystallized into a glittering fractal of fiction. The air hums with the weight of unspoken truths, a metallic tang on your tongue like bitten pennies. Your shadow detaches itself and slithers up the fractured walls, whispering new stories into the cracks: *You were raised by wolves in a neon-lit tundra. You once seduced a storm god with a song. Your bones are hollow, filled with stardust.*  

The floor liquefies beneath you, and you plunge into a river of ink. Words coil around your limbs—*orphan, prodigy, thief*—each label spawning cities that bloom and collapse in your wake. A clockwork owl with your mother’s eyes hoots from a dead oak, its gears rusted with half-remembered truths. “Confess,” it croaks, but your mouth stitches itself shut with spider silk.  

You claw your way onto a shore of burnt pages, where faceless audiences crowd around campfires, hungry for your tales. You spin them a saga of your **death by moonlight**, your voice weaving a tapestry so lush even the stars lean closer to listen. But the ground quakes as your lies metastasize: the campfires erupt into dragons, the audience melts into waxen puppets, and the sky splits open to reveal a colossal hourglass. Sand rains down, each grain etching a timestamped lie into your skin.  

A child made of smoke tugs your sleeve. “Which one is real?” they ask, their voice echoing with the hollow timbre of forgotten playgrounds. You open your mouth to answer, but your teeth crumble into ash, and the dream fractures—  

**You wake, gasping, your pillowcase damp with saltwater and the faint glow of bioluminescent lies still flickering beneath your eyelids.**
