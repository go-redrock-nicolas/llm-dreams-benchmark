I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, luminescent ocean under an endless twilight sky. The waves crash gently, their foam glittering with the hues of twilight—lavender, periwinkle, and soft gold. The air carries a crisp, salty tang, mingling with a faint, earthy scent of ancient wood. 

Before you, half-submerged in the water, lies the wreck of a magnificent ship. Its broken hull, weathered and worn, seems to call to you. You can't help but notice that it bears your name etched into its side, now faint and obscured by time and salt. 

The rhythmic sound of the waves grows heavier, more insistent, like a heartbeat. Each crash reverberates through your chest, anchoring your feet as if urging you to stay and face what lies before you. As the tide pulls back, a pathway appears, faintly illuminated, leading into the depths of the ship's interior. 

Curiosity tugs at you, and you step cautiously onto the wet, slippery planks. Strangely, you feel no cold, no discomfort, only an overwhelming sense of anticipation. With each step, the faint sounds of whispers grow louder, like fragments of forgotten conversations carried on the wind. 

The ship's insides are hollowed, its walls thick with moss and seaweed. Tiny glowing orbs float in the air, casting a pale, ethereal light that casts shifting shadows across the floorboards. You see objects scattered around: remnants of past voyages, tarnished relics, and symbols of love and pain. 

Suddenly, the whispers become sharper, almost intelligible. A soft voice calls your name. You turn toward it and see a figure at the far end of the ship—an outline of someone you know yet can't quite place. They stand there, fragile yet resolute, gazing out at the horizon. 

“Who are you?” you call out, your voice trembling against the ocean's roar. No response comes, but the figure turns slightly, its face obscured by dark, flowing hair. They reach out a hand, inviting yet somehow terrifying. 

The ship groans beneath you, as if the wood itself is pleading. You take another step closer, but the deck beneath you shifts. The ship begins to sink, and the water rises rapidly around your ankles, threatening to pull you under. Fear grips you, yet something deeper—a yearning—compels you forward. 

As you draw nearer to the figure, the whispers become urgent and clear: “Don’t turn back. It’s time to let go.” The shadowy shape fades into the ether. The water now rises to your chest. You struggle, thrashing against the pull of the sea and the inevitable sinking ship. 

“It’s okay,” a voice—your voice—distantly echoes. “It’s time to set sail again.” 

But the sea closes in, pulling you under. You struggle for breath, your chest burning, your mind racing. And then you wake, heart pounding, gasping for air in the stillness of your room. A faint scent of salt lingers in the air, and you lie there, trembling, a sense of release mingling with the fear that still clings to your skin. 

You lie there, lungs aching as the faint taste of salt lingers on your tongue. You blink, trying to adjust to the dim light of your room, but the vision of the ship is burned vividly in your mind. Your chest heaves, each breath sharp, as if you had truly been submerged. The room is silent and still, the comforter wrapped securely around you offering little comfort. 

For a moment, you wonder if the water was ever real—or if it was simply the manifestation of a weight you've carried for too long. The cycle you've fought so hard to break surges up again, its tide threatening to pull you back in. The weight of it all presses down, waterlogged and suffocating,
