I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of petrichor, though no rain has fallen. You stand in a vast, shifting library where the shelves are not made of wood but of liquid mercury, their edges rippling like the surface of a disturbed pond. Books float inches above the shelves, pages fluttering as if whispering secrets to one another in a language just beyond your grasp. The ceiling is a kaleidoscope of constellations, each star pulsing in time with your heartbeat.  

You’ve come here chasing a hunch—a flicker in your chest that led you to this impossible place. Logic told you this was nonsense, a fever dream born of overwork. But your intuition, that quiet voice that hums in your bones, insisted: *Trust the flicker.*  

A book detaches itself from a shelf and drifts toward you. Its cover is unmarked, its spine warm to the touch, as though it’s been waiting in the sun. When you open it, the pages are blank—until you exhale. Then ink bleeds into existence, forming maps of cities you’ve never seen but somehow know intimately. Streets twist into spirals, alleyways whisper your name, and a red X blinks in the corner of one page, pulsing like a heartbeat. You feel it: *This is the path.*  

You follow the map through the library’s labyrinth, though logic screams that the corridors defy geometry. Walls shift when you blink; staircases coil like serpents, ascending into fog. At every dead end, a riddle appears, etched into the air in glowing script. But solving them with reason only deepens the confusion. When you close your eyes and *feel* the answer—a shiver in your fingertips, a tug behind your navel—the walls part like curtains, revealing the way forward.  

In the heart of the labyrinth, you find a room where time pools on the floor like water. Reflections show not your face, but versions of yourself: one weeping, one laughing, one holding a child you’ve never met but ache for. At the center stands a pedestal, and atop it, a compass with no needle. Instead, a single drop of liquid gold spins in midair, quivering toward directions that don’t exist.  

You reach out, and the compass dissolves into your skin. Sudden clarity floods you—a knowing that bypasses thought. You understand now: this domain, this labyrinth of knowledge, is alive. It rewards not the dissecting mind, but the listening soul. The books here are not facts to be cataloged, but stories yearning to be *felt*. Truths here are not solved; they are *sensed*, like the warmth of a hand in yours in the dark.  

As you turn, the room begins to dissolve. The constellations above unravel into fireflies, the mercury shelves harden into stone, and the map in your hand crumbles to ash. But the compass’s gold lingers in your chest, a molten ember.  

You wake with the taste of copper on your tongue and the certainty that something has shifted. In the waking world, you’ll find yourself pausing before meetings, before decisions, before arguments. You’ll tilt your head, close your eyes, and *listen*—not to the clamor of logic, but to the quiet, unerring hum beneath it. And when you follow that hum, doors will open.  

The dream fades, but the ember remains. Intuition, you realize, is not a shadow of reason. It is a light all its own.
