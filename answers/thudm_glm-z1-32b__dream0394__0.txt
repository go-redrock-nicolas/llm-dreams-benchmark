I am dreaming. The world twists and morphs around me, blending colors and sounds into a surreal collage. My feet don't touch the ground, yet I move with purpose, guided by an unseen hand. A labyrinth of shifting passageways unfolds before me—walls made of liquid mercury shimmer and flow, reflecting galaxies and nebulae within their depths.

As I navigate this labyrinth, I encounter a choice: follow the path of predictable patterns, a straight corridor lined with flickering neon lights that hum a soothing lullaby, or venture into the tangled maze, where the paths twist and shatter, revealing vistas of kaleidoscopic worlds and whispering trees with leaves that hum sonnets. The neon corridor feels like home, a familiar embrace, but the maze pulses with electric potential, its edges burning with<beginofsentence># How to Solve System of Equations with 3 Variables in 3 Simple Steps?

Have you ever found yourself faced with a system of equations containing three variables and felt overwhelmed? Don't worry; solving such systems is more straightforward than it appears. In this blog post, we will break down the process into three easy-to-follow steps. By the end, you'll be confident in solving any 3-variable system.

## Step 1: Choose a Pair of Equations and Eliminate One Variable

The first step is to pick any two equations from your system. Let's say we have these three equations:

\[ \begin{cases}
2x + 3y - z = 5 \\
x - y + 4z = 3 \\
3x + 2y + z = 10
\end{cases} \]

We'll start by selecting the first two equations:

1. \( 2x + 3y - z = 5 \)  
2. \( x - y + 4z = 3 \)

Our goal is to eliminate one variable. Let's choose to eliminate \(z\) since its coefficient is -1 in the first equation and +4 in the second. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 4:

1a. \( 8x + 12y - 4z = 20 \)

Now, add equation 1a to equation 2:

\( (8x + x) + (12y - y) + (-4z + 4z) = 20 + 3 \)

Simplifying, we get:

\( 9x + 11y = 23 \)   Let's call this Equation 4

Great! We've eliminated \(z\) and created a new equation with two variables.

## Step 2: Repeat the Process with Another Pair of Equations

Next, we need to eliminate the same variable (\(z\)) from another pair. Let's use equations 2 and 3 this time:

2. \( x - y + 4z = 3 \)  
3. \( 3x + 2y + z = 10 \)

To eliminate \(z\), multiply Equation 3 by 4:

3a. \( 12x + 8y + 4z = 40 \)

Now, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3a:

\( (12x - x) + (8y + y) + (4z - 4z) = 40 - 3 \)

Simplifying:

\( 11x + 9y = 37 \)   Let's call this Equation 5

Now we have two new equations (4 and 5) with only \(x\) and \(y\):

4. \( 9x + 11y = 23 \)  
5. \( 11x + 9y = 37 \)

## Step 3: Solve the Two-Variable System and Back-Substitute

Now we solve Equations 4 and 5. Let's use the elimination method again. Let's eliminate \(y\) by making their coefficients equal. Multiply Equation 4 by 9 and Equation 5 by 11:

4a. \( 81x + 99y = 207 \)  
5a. \( 121x + 99y = 407 \)

Subtract Equation 4a from 5a:

\( (121x - 81x) + (99y - 99y) = 407 - 207 \)

\( 40x = 200 \)

Divide by 40:

\( x = 5 \)

Now plug \(x = 5\) into Equation 4:

\( 9(5) + 11y = 23 \)

\( 45 + 11y = 23 \)

Subtract 45:

\( 11y = -22 \)

Divide by 11:

\( y = -2 \)

Now we have \(x = 5\) and \(y = -2\). To find \(z\), substitute these values into any original equation. Let's use Equation 2:

\( x - y + 4z = 3 \)

\( 5 - (-2) + 4z = 3 \)

\( 5 + 2 + 4z = 3 \)

\( 7 + 4z = 3 \)

Subtract 7:

\( 4z = -4 \)

Divide by 4:

\( z = -1 \)

**Solution**: \( x = 5 \), \( y = -2 \), \( z = -1 \)

## Verification

To ensure accuracy, plug the values back into all original equations:

1. \( 2(5) + 3(-2) - (-1) = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5  \)  
2. \( 5 - (-2) + 4(-1) = 5 + 2 - 4 = 3  \)  
3. \( 3(5) + 2(-2) + (-1) = 15 - 4 - 1 = 10  \)

All equations are satisfied, confirming the solution.

## Key Tips for Success

1. **Stay Organized**: Keep track of your steps and equations, labeling them as you go (Equation 4, 5, etc.).
2. **Choose Easy Variables to Eliminate**: Look for variables with coefficients that are multiples of each other to minimize fractions.
3. **Check Your Work**: Always substitute your solutions back into the original equations to catch any mistakes.

By following these three simple steps—eliminating one variable from two equations, repeating with another pair, and solving the remaining two-variable system—you can tackle any 3-variable system with confidence. Remember, practice makes perfect!
