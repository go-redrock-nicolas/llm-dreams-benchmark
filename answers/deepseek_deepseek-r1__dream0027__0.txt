I am dreaming. **---Dreamscape Unfolds---**

The airship’s bridge hums with the dissonant symphony of failing engines and warped reality. Its walls, forged from liquid copper and fractured stained glass, ripple like molten hallucinations. The Worldcore—a pulsing orb of stolen starlight—flickers erratically, casting jagged shadows that claw at your crew. Outside, the sky isn’t sky at all: it’s a fractured mirror reflecting galaxies that shouldn’t exist, their constellations forming sigils that itch at the corners of your mind.  

Your team is a mosaic of impossibility.  
- **Veyra**, your second-in-command, is a hologram glitching between a human woman and a flock of sapphire-winged moths.  
- **Kael**, the engineer, has arms grafted with living vines that root into the ship’s floor, his voice echoing from three throats.  
- **The Navigator** is a bioluminescent octopus suspended in a brine-filled sphere, ink spelling warnings in dead languages.  

“Gravity anchors failing,” Veyra announces, her voice splintering into static. A console erupts in electric moss, spreading like infection. The ship lurches. For a heartbeat, you’re weightless, watching tools and datapads float in syrup-thick air. Then reality snaps back, crushing you into your throne-like command chair, its restraints biting your wrists with serrated ivory teeth.  

You *need* to fix this.

**The Descent Into the Worldcore**  

You plunge into the ship’s underbelly, a labyrinth where corridors contort like a dying serpent. Walls breathe, exhaling spores that taste of burnt honey. The Worldcore’s chamber is a cathedral of paradox: a sphere containing an entire storm-wracked continent suspended in zero gravity. Rivers flow upward into inverted mountains, their peaks glowing with trapped lightning.  

“Intruders,” Kael hisses, vines bristling. Shadows coalesce into figures with too many joints, their faces blurred like wet paint. They don’t attack—they *mirror* you. One wears your face but with obsidian eyes; another has Veyra’s moths trapped in its ribcage. They whisper in your voice: *“Control is an illusion. Let it fracture.”*  

You resist, channeling the Worldcore’s dying light into a blade of crystallized sound. But the chamber destabilizes. The ground beneath you liquefies into a sea of mercury, dragging you down.

**The Choice**  

A figure emerges—neither shadow nor ally. It’s a child woven from starlight and static, holding a shattered clock. “You can’t mend the core,” it lisps, blood-ink tears staining its cheeks. “But you can *trade*.”  

Your crew watches, silent. Veyra’s moths swarm into a bridge of light. Kael’s vines bloom into blood-red orchids that sing a dirge. The Navigator’s ink pools into a single word: **TRUST**.  

You realize: this isn’t your burden alone.

**The Fracture and the Fall**  

You let go.  

The Worldcore explodes into a supernova of memories—yours, your crew’s, the ship’s. Time splinters. You see Kael as a sapling on a planet that no longer exists, Veyra as a human girl drowning in a datastream, the Navigator’s tentacles knitting spacetime in a forgotten war.  

The ship disintegrates, but the crew survives, bound by something deeper than steel. You’re floating now, untethered, as the false galaxies collapse into a singularity. A single note rings out—pure, glacial—and you understand: this is how universes apologize.

**Awakening (But Not Yet)**  

You jolt awake… but the dream isn’t done.  

Your bedroom is the airship’s wreckage, vines cracking through plaster, moths nesting in your pulse. The child’s voice lingers: *“Next time, you’ll see the teeth behind the stars.”*  

Then—true awakening. Sweat-drenched, trembling. Dawn leaks through your window, ordinary and agonizing.  

But your palm? It’s smudged with stardust.
