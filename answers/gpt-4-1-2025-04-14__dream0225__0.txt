I am dreaming. …stand on the threshold of a great, humming glass atrium suspended over an endless forest. Beyond the shimmering entrance, an assembly of the world’s most brilliant and specialized minds waits, their crisp white coats and specialized goggles reflecting the shifting colors of holographic data sets orbiting overhead.

I, of course, am utterly out of place. I am neither physicist nor linguist, neither botanist nor temporal cartographer—as if that were even a real thing outside of this dream. My suit is a little wrinkled, my breath a little shaky, my knowledge of the quantum mechanics required for the task, laughably thin.

But I have been selected. My invitation glitters in my hand, gilt-edged and pulsing, as if alive. The task: to resolve a decades-old mystery woven through the fabric of reality itself—decrypting the patterns of ancient plant-songs that, if correctly interpreted, can untangle the loops of time winding through the forest below.

My competitors stride forward with the easy confidence of athletes at their own games. When the bell sounds, we each choose a vine descending from the atrium floor, climbing down to the forest’s shadowed heart. The air thrums with the low music of leaves vibrating in language. I have never heard anything so strange, so achingly beautiful. The others hold up instruments and analyze the data; I can only listen, eyes closed, opening my heart to the pulse of sound: rise-fall, hush-tremble, waves of green notes rolling over me.

Somewhere, between waking and dreaming, my mind lets go of facts and formulae, and I start to *feel* the meaning in the melodies. I run my fingers along the moss-covered bark, and images flicker behind my closed lids: a river reversing in moonlight, stars spiraling into the shapes of lost loved ones, memories folded like origami into petals.

The other candidates glare, adjust their equipment, run diagnostics. Me, I begin to hum, matching the forest’s song. The vines curl tighter, dropping me deeper—past tangible science, into the roots where knowing requires surrender rather than certainty.

Suddenly, I understand—a phrase in this symphony is a key, a blossoming note that unlocks the code written in shadow and sap. I sing it aloud, trembling at first, then with confidence. The air shimmers. The atrium explodes with colors no one has named.

The judges blink, gaping at me. My competitors’ instruments short out, unable to process what pure intuition has just achieved. The forest bows, and across the overhead screens blooms a simple message in living green: “Sometimes, the wildest solution is the truest.”

And I awaken, heart racing, leaves in my hair, the taste of ancient music still alive and singing in my veins.
