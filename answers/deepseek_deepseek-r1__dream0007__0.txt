I am dreaming. **[The Dream]**

You stand in a vast field of pale blue grass that ripples like liquid under a sky streaked with vermillion and gold. The air hums with the dissonant harmony of unseen creatures, their voices both shrill and melodic, like violins played with broken bows. Your friend, whose face shifts between familiarity and strangeness—eyes flickering from deep amber to liquid silver—raises a hand, and the ground trembles.

"You don’t understand," they say, their words not matching the movement of their lips. Each syllable hangs in the air as a glowing glyph, pulsating with accusations: *selfish, reckless, abandon.* The symbols claw at your skin, leaving faint trails of frost. 

You try to respond, but your voice splinters. Instead, rivers of light pour from your mouth, coalescing into shapes—a lighthouse crumbling into the sea, a child’s hand reaching for a butterfly made of ash. Your friend recoils, their silhouette fraying at the edges like burnt paper. 

The earth splits. A staircase spirals downward, its steps made of shattered mirrors. You both descend, and in the reflections, infinite versions of your argument play out: one where you scream until the sky cracks, another where you dissolve into laughter that blooms into bouquets of thorns. At the bottom, a pool of mercury reflects neither of you—only a single clockwork sparrow, rusted and silent. 

Your friend picks it up. The moment their fingers touch it, the dream unravels. The field, the stairway, the sparrow—all collapse into a symphony of static. You wake with the taste of copper and the echo of a phrase neither of you ever spoke aloud: *"What if we’re both lying to the truth?"*
