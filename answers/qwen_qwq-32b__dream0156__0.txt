I am dreaming. The dream begins with the user realizing they've been glued to their phone, obsessively scrolling through social media.  They feel a deep sense of guilt as they look at the screen time report—10 hours a day. Suddenly, they’re in a digital wasteland where people are zombies plugged into glowing screens.

The environment is bleak, with phone towers mutated into monstrous structures. The sky is flickering like a broken screen. The user tries to escape but their fingers move involuntarily towards a glowing phone. The phone (sucking force?) pulls them in. They resist and enter a hidden garden with vibrant colors—symbolizing reconnection with real life.

The garden evolves; flowers with faces sing warnings about the dangers of screen overuse. A crystalline river flows with data streams. They drink, gaining clarity. The river guides them to a massive server farm (heart?), representing the core of their digital addiction. Inside, faces of loved ones appear, showing how their real connections have been neglected. The user faces a choice: return to the wasteland or embrace the garden's renewal.

The user wakes upResolved to unplug. The lesson is about finding balance and valuing real experiences.
