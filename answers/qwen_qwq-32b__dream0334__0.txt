I am dreaming. I am standing in a garden. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and ripe peaches. I feel the cool, damp earth beneath my bare feet as I walk over to the edge of a small pond. The water shimmers with an almost unnatural blue, and as I dip my hand into it, it feels like liquid fire against my fingertips. Suddenly, a breeze picks up, carrying the sound of distant laughter. Shadows dart between the trees, but when I turn to look, they're gone. A butterfly lands on my shoulder, its wings translucent and glowing like stained glass. I reach out to touch it, but as soon as I do, it dissolves into a trail of glittering dust. The sky above begins to swirl—a kaleidoscope of colors—before morphing into a constellation map that pulses with a hypnotic rhythm. I hear a voice, soft and ancient, speaking in a language I don’t understand, yet somehow, I comprehend. It tells me of journeys yet to come, of paths chosen and paths abandoned, and of a secret buried deep within the roots of the oldest tree in the forest. My chest tightens as a surge of unnamed emotion sweeps through me. I try to speak, but my words emerge as a melody, harmonizing with the wind. Everything feels urgent, yet timeless. I run toward the heart of the forest, my breath syncing with the pulse of the stars above, racing against an unseen clock that ticks in reverse. The trees grow taller, their bark twisting into intricate symbols that tell stories of forgotten civilizations. A pool of liquid silver awaits me at the forest’s center, reflecting not my face, but a version of myself standing in a crowd I don’t recognize. Just as I reach to touch the surface, the dream shifts—a child’s laugh echoes, and I wake, heart racing, the taste of stardust still lingering on my tongue.
