I am dreaming. The air hums, thick with the scent of damp earth and distant lightning, though the sky above is a bruised purple, starless and depthless—not quite night, not quite twilight. I stand at the edge of a bridge, or perhaps a long pier, its wooden planks warped with age, groaning under my weight despite the fact that I know, with dream-logic certainty, that I am floating just above them.  

Below me stretches a river—or is it ink? The liquid is too black, too still, a mirror polished to unnatural perfection. When I lean over, my reflection does not mimic me. Instead, it remains stoic, arms crossed, eyes burning with quiet impatience. "Choose," it says. No—it doesn’t speak. The word simply appears in my mind, heavy as an anvil dropped into still water.  

But choose *what*?  

To my left, a door stands upright in the middle of the bridge, unmoored from any wall. It is pale, splintering at the edges, its brass knob dull with neglect. Behind it, faint and syrupy, laughter spills through, warm and inviting.  

To my right, a staircase descends into the river. The steps are glass, or ice, and the black water laps hungrily at the bottom one, waiting, expectant. A whisper rises from the depths—my own voice, but softer, frayed at the edges. *Come down here. Come see.*  

I should move. The choice should be simple, instinctive. A door or stairs? Warmth or depth? But my limbs feel woven into the air itself, tethered by invisible threads, tightening with each passing second of hesitation. The reflection in the river begins to scowl. "You always do this," it accuses, though its mouth never moves.  

A sound shudders behind me—wings, enormous and unseen, stirring the electric air. I don’t turn, but I feel hot breath at the nape of my neck, slow and deliberate, like a predator savoring anticipation. *Danger*, my body screams. *Move now or be lost.*  

But to where?  

The door rattles, just slightly, as though someone on the other side has pressed their palm against it. The staircase groans, a low, stomach-deep sound, pulling—not just at my feet, but at something behind my ribs.  

I open my mouth to speak, to ask, to *demand* an explanation—but the dream is already dissolving, the colors bleeding into white noise, and the last thing I hear is my reflection sighing, a sound like rusted hinges.  

"You'll be back."  

And then—nothing.
