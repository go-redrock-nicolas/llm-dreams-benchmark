I am dreaming. …survive, and survive quickly, because the epoch you’ve fallen into is as magnificent as it is merciless.

You drag yourself upright on soil that smells of wild thyme and damp clay. The air is startlingly clear, rinsed of the industrial haze you once took for granted, and the sky above you is a luxurious ultramarine that seems almost painted. The sun, though only a fist-width above the horizon, is already hot enough to sting the back of your neck. A chorus of cicadas rattles in the underbrush, joined by the distant croak of marsh-frogs and the shrill cry of birds you cannot name.

The landscape stretches out like a tapestry of another world—rolling amber fields, scattered stands of cypress and olive, and, far off, a walled city patched together from ochre stone. Its towers are stunted, its rooftops flat; plumes of woodsmoke curl lazily from open chimneys. No electric lines scar the skyline, no hum of engines rides the breeze. Somewhere inside those walls, you hope, lies water, shelter, and maybe a handful of answers.

But first—clothing. You glance down: you’re wearing only the rumpled cotton sleep-clothes you went to bed in. They feel absurdly flimsy in this robust, slow-moving world, like tissue paper caught in a thunderstorm. So you scout the nearby scrub, heart hammering, looking for anything that might be repurposed. Luck strikes: a shepherd’s woven cloak, sun-bleached and frayed, hangs from a low branch, forgotten or discarded. You press it to your nose; it smells of lanolin, dust, and a faint ghost of smoke—honest smells, the smells of life before internal-combustion and fluorescent light. You wrap it around your shoulders, instantly warmer and, somehow, braver.

Water next. Downhill, silver ribbons flash between reeds: a river. You hurry toward it, thirsty enough to feel your tongue thicken. At the bank, you kneel and cup the water in your palms. It’s shockingly cold, snowmelt from distant mountains, and tastes of iron and moss. You drink until your stomach sloshes.

You rise, wiping your mouth, and in that moment a hush falls over the riverbank. The cicadas pause. Even the frogs simmer down to silence. Instinct prickles along your arms. You peer through the reeds—and lock eyes with a figure in lambskin and bronze. A girl no older than fifteen, barefoot, gripping a short spear tipped with glittering obsidian. Her hair is braided with river grass; her gaze is sharp as hawk-talons.

She studies your clothes, your strange face, the luminous wristwatch that no longer ticks. You can practically see the clockwork of suspicion turning behind her eyes. Slowly, deliberately, you spread your hands to show you hold no weapon. She doesn’t lower the spear, but her stance eases by a hairbreadth.

A language barrier yawns between you. She says something lilting and clipped—a musical tongue you’ve never heard. You try English, then Spanish, each falling flat. Finally you point to yourself. “Traveler,” you say, and hope the tone conveys innocence. Then you point to the city walls in the distance and mimic walking. “City. Food. Peace.”

She tilts her head. After a moment’s calculation, she beckons. You follow. The two of you trek along narrow goat paths, winding past terraces of barley and grapevine. Farmers pause in their labor to stare. A bearded elder mutters a blessing—or perhaps a curse—under his breath. You can almost feel their judgment weighing your every step: stranger, outlier, portent of change.

The city gates loom, built of sun-baked brick and lashed timber. Above them hangs a carved wooden sigil: a lion devouring the sun. Guardians lounge there, swathed in quilted leather, blades dangling from rawhide belts. Your young guide exchanges rapid words with one of them. At length the guard waves you through, but not before tapping your pockets and confiscating your watch, which he turns over and over like some exotic gemstone.

Inside, the city is an aromatic maze—fresh bread, goat dung, cabbage stew, tannins from vats of fermenting wine. Merchants hawk their wares beneath striped awnings: rough-spun linens, clay amphorae, cured fish strung like silver pennants. Everywhere, artisans chisel marble, hammer bronze, weave baskets that smell of willow bark. Children chase a hoop down an alley; a dog barks at a mule. You are wide-eyed, slack-jawed, drunk on the sensory deluge.

Your guide brings you to a communal courtyard where a small spring burbles into a stone basin. Here she introduces you—largely by gesture—to an elderly woman with gold tattoos spiraling up her forearms. The woman touches your watch, now dangling from a leather thong, and murmurs something reverent. She motions for you to sit, then hands you a wooden bowl of lentil stew fragrant with cumin and wild mint. You eat greedily, feeling life seep back into your limbs.

Night falls like velvet. Torches gutter along the lane, their flames dancing in the wind. Somewhere a reed flute pipes a mournful song, and you feel the ache of homesickness, of time-sickness, knifing through your chest. You scan the sky for familiar constellations. They’re there, but slightly skewed, as though the heavens themselves have slipped a cog.

You realize you need to decide: search for a way back to your own century, or surrender to the raw beauty of this one—and survive, day by cobbled day, in the fragile peace between harvests and wars. The choice hangs heavy as the moon, and in that tremulous suspension you feel the elastic of dreaming stretch one last time—

—and snap.

But you do not wake. Not yet. Instead, you breathe in the scent of woodsmoke and thyme, clutch the shepherd’s cloak tighter, and step forward into the song of the age, determined to carve meaning from its untamed night.
