I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Scales of Obsidian and Light**

---

You stand at the threshold of a sprawling desert, but this is no ordinary wasteland. The sand beneath your feet is jet-black, flecked with glints of iridescent silver, crunching like shattered glass as you walk. Above, a bruised indigo sky pulses with constellations shaped like eyes—each one blinking in judgment. A whisper curls around your ear, sharp as a blade: *"You’ve never been enough."*  

But then you notice them: **doors**. Hundreds of them, splintering the horizon. Some are ornate, gilded with vines of gold; others are splintered wood or rusted iron. Each bears a nameplate etched in a language you somehow understand. *First Job. Art Project. Forgiven Friend. Survived 2020.* Your achievements, you realize—but the doors are padlocked, draped in chains that hum faintly, as if ashamed.  

You reach for the nearest one—*Published Poem, Age 19*—and the chain disintegrates into smoke. The door swings open to reveal not a memory, but a **forest of glowing trees**, their leaves parchment-thin and rustling with the words you once wrote. A stag with antlers made of inkblots steps forward, bowing as if to say, *This mattered.*  

But the desert fights back. A storm rolls in—a maelstrom of mercury-colored sand that stings your skin. It sculpts grotesque figures: a shadowy version of you, hunched and hissing, *"You failed the interview. You let them down. You’re a fraud."* The figure holds a mirror that warps your reflection into something small, fractured.  

Then—a sound. A low, resonant *hum* from below. You drop to your knees, clawing through the black sand until your fingers brush something cool: **a scale**, ancient and enormous, buried like a fossil. One side overflows with jagged obsidian stones, each carved with a single flaw: *Too Quiet. Hesitated. Burned the Toast.* The other side holds only a lone feather, iridescent as a dragonfly’s wing, labeled *Listened When It Mattered.*  

"*Balance requires both,*" murmurs a voice like wind through reeds. The shadow-self lunges, but you’re quicker now. You snatch a graphite feather from the poem-forest—*Finished the Draft*—and drop it onto the scale. The obsidian trembles. Another feather from a gilded door—*Made Her Laugh Again*—then another. The stones shrink, their edges softening into smooth pebbles.  

The mercury storm stills. The desert cracks open, and water surges upward—not liquid, but liquid *light*, pooling into a mirror that shows not your face, but a mosaic: every shard a moment you dismissed as "small," now glowing fiercely. The doors behind you burst open in unison, flooding the landscape with colors you’ve never seen—colors that *name themselves* in your mind. *Resilience. Grace. Enough.*  

You wake just as the first sun rises over this new world—a meadow where the air tastes like honey and the shadows sing lullabies. Your pulse echoes the dream’s final whisper:  
"*You are the curator of your life, not its critic.*"

**Footnote**  
The dream lingers. You scribble it down, your hand trembling. That night, you place a pebble and a feather on your windowsill—a pact with the universe to weigh both more gently.
