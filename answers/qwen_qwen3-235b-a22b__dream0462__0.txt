I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt honey and ozone, thick and golden, as if the atmosphere itself is alive. Above you, the sky is not a sky but a vast, undulating tapestry of liquid mercury, reflecting and refracting constellations that do not exist in any earthly atlas. Stars pulse like heartbeats, their light casting shadows that move independently of your body, whispering secrets in a language of flickers.  

You stand on a shore, but the ocean before you is not water—it is a sea of liquid glass, smooth and trembling, mirroring the inverted world beneath its surface. When you step forward, your reflection does not follow. Instead, it stays rooted, smiling faintly, before dissolving into a flock of iridescent birds that scatter across the mirrored horizon. Their wings leave trails of smoke that curl into glyphs, then into vines, then into veins that crawl up your arms, warm and electric.  

A forest rises to your left, but the trees are not trees. They are colossal spires of crystalized sound, vibrating at frequencies that make your bones ache with nostalgia. Each note you touch—literally plucks from the air—unfurls into a memory you’ve never lived: a childhood in a city of floating lanterns, a kiss beneath a twin-mooned sky, the weight of a sword in your hand that hums with the name of a forgotten god. The ground beneath your feet is soft, pulsing like the skin of a living creature, and when you kneel, it blooms into bioluminescent flowers that sing in harmonies that make your tears fall as liquid starlight.  

A figure approaches, neither human nor beast, its form shifting like smoke caught in a prism. Its face is a shifting mosaic of your own features, your mother’s eyes, a stranger’s smile, the antlers of a stag, the wings of a moth. It speaks without sound, its voice a vibration in your molars: *“Here, the only pressure is the weight of wonder. Create, and uncreate. There are no deadlines in the marrow of the universe.”*  

You reach out, and your hands are no longer hands. They are clouds, then ink, then a swarm of fireflies spelling out equations that bloom into miniature galaxies. You laugh, and the sound crystallizes into butterflies that dissolve into perfume. Time here is not a river but a lake, still and infinite, and you wade into it, letting the water peel away layers of expectation, of deadlines, of the brittle shell of “should.”  

Behind you, the shore is now a city—a city built from every idea you’ve ever abandoned, glowing like a coral reef of forgotten dreams. Towers twist like seashells, their spirals echoing the Fibonacci sequence. Bridges of liquid shadow connect them, and in the distance, a clockwork whale swims through the air, its belly full of unborn constellations.  

You realize, with a clarity that shivers through your non-corporeal form, that this is the sanctuary. The place where creativity is not mined but marveled at, where the act of making is not a task but a tantric dance with the void. Here, you are both the artist and the chaos, the question and the echo.  

When you wake, the taste of mercury-honey lingers on your tongue. The dream clings to your bones like perfume. And for once, the blank page before you does not feel like a wall—but a door.
