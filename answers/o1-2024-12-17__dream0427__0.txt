I am dreaming. You find yourself floating above a lavishly colored cityscape, where towering spires scrape the ink-black sky and emit a faint, silver glow. The rooftops glitter like fragments of broken mirrors, catching all the starlight for themselves. A vivid surge of curiosity tingles through your body; it’s as if your soul has become an antenna, picking up subtle signals from everything around you. A gentle breeze cocooned in the scent of jasmine ruffles through your hair, and you realize you’re gently descending, dropping softly onto a cobblestone intersection that stretches toward every horizon.

A flicker of orange glimmers to your left. As you turn, you notice an ornately carved wooden mask, propped on a small pedestal in the middle of the street. The mask’s surface is etched with swirling lines and tiny gemstones that shimmer in the glow of lampposts. Something about this mask draws you closer—it feels so intimately familiar, like an extension of yourself. Your heart throbs with an inexplicable desire to both wear it and yet cast it away.

When you lift the mask, its weight feels heavier than expected, like it is burdened with secrets. The moment the carved wood touches your face, your vision becomes a wild carnival of color. You hear drums and distant violins in a chaotic but strangely mesmerizing melody. You look down, blinking, to see that your clothes have changed: you’re now dressed in an elaborate costume—velvet robes with dancing threads of gold weaving elaborate motives across your sleeves. You stand a little straighter. Your steps become overly poised as you glide through the winding streets. Passersby bow with polite smiles, whispering approval. You nod in return, relishing the attention.

Yet, a flicker of discomfort sparks in the back of your mind. Why are you playing a part? Doesn’t all this pomp and show feel alien, like an ill-fitting garment? But instead of removing the mask, you stride down the street, delighting in the compliments, the applause, and the warm glow of admiration. All the while, something tugs at you from within—a reminder of a more honest self.

Suddenly, a swirl of wind sweeps up fallen leaves, swirling them into a luminescent spiral. The leaves catch fire in midair, crackling and hissing as they revolve around you. In the center of that flame, you see a reflection in a puddle at your feet. But it’s not your masked, regal visage staring back. It’s the unadorned version of you, eyes wide with vulnerability, clad in simple, comfortable clothes you usually wear alone at home—your true self, the one that doesn't worry about applause or stares.

With a surge of courage, you reach up to remove the ornate mask. At first, it refuses to budge. It clings to your face, as if it’s grown roots into your skin. Alarm washes over you, but you steady your breath and give one fervent pull. The mask relinquishes its grip, and the opulent glow from your costume ebbs away, replaced by the familiar contours of your everyday attire.

A hush falls over the street. The spectators—previously effusive and adoring—turn their eyes away in silence. No applause, no approving nods. You feel reduced to simplicity, unadorned. A tremor of doubt flickers in your mind. What if they find nothing memorable about you now?

Yet, in that soft, unpretentious hush, you take a deep breath. The cool night air tastes like liberation. You suddenly realize that the sense of relief and warmth in your chest eclipses any longing for shallow praise. The air around you begins to shimmer, each lamppost flickers out, and the sky above unfolds into a blanket of brilliant stars. You see your reflection in a windowpane: it is you, exactly as you are, without the burden of performance. The corners of your mouth lift.

You step past the discarded mask, letting it topple and roll into a storm drain. With every step, the cityscape brightens in new and subtle ways: flowers bloom from cracks in the cobblestone, faint silver vines twist up walls, and gentle harp music drifts in from unseen corners. You can feel the authenticity of your soul adding vividness to the world around you. Each thought, each breath resonates honestly, and with each exhalation, you claim your freedom.

You wake from this dream with a lingering sensation of wonder, fully aware of what you’ve learned. The set of expectations and self-presentation you carry in public might be admired by many, but it’s a fragile shell. Beneath it lies a truer self—one that breathes life more richly and sees the colors of the world more clearly. And so, you return to consciousness, keenly aware of your authenticity gap, with a resolve to bring your private vibrancy into the light of day, letting it illuminate your world and everyone within it.
