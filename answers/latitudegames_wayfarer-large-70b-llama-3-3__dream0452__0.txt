I am dreaming. As I stand in the misty forest, I see the beautiful garden we once tended together. Ours was a relationship bursting with vibrant life - flowers of every color bloomed at our touch, and every tree seemed to stretch ever higher under our shared care. But now, the once-pristine paths are overgrown with thorny vines, and the flowers have wilted.

Your presence still wafts through like the sweetest perfume, yet it now makes my skin prickle uncomfortably. The trees lean heavily towards you, their branches skeletal in the fading light. I reach to touch what was once our favorite cherry blossom tree, but its bark is rough and cold beneath my fingertips.

I remember how we used to walk hand in hand through these lush grounds, our laughter echoing off the very trees. But now, an unsettling silence falls when I call out. The very sound seems to shatter some invisible tether binding me to this place.

With a heavy heart, I know it's time to let go. The gardener's tools I once wielded so lovingly feel impossibly heavy. I lay them down gently at the root of our first shared sapling, my fingers tracing the grooves our grip left over the years.

As I turn to leave, I notice something new - a tiny sprout pushes its way through the cracked soil where I stood. It's delicate, uncertain, but also unencumbered. I realize that while endings are painful, they make room for new beginnings I cannot yet see. I take one last look at the garden we built together, then turn towards the sunrise breaking through the misty trees, welcoming whatever growth lies ahead.
