I am dreaming. At first, there is only the sound—deep, resonant, rhythmic, like the pulse of some vast, unseen machine. And then the world swims into view, a landscape of liquid bronze and molten gold, shifting like a mirage. The very air glistens, heavy with the scent of burning amber and salt.  

I stand at the center of a sprawling city, but it is unlike any I have ever seen. The buildings are not static structures but living things—towers of spiraling glass that hum with inner light, bridges grown from the interwoven roots of ancient trees, stairways that spiral endlessly upward, vanishing into the clouds. The sky above is not blue, but a cascading spectrum of colors, like light fractured through a prism, shifting with each breath I take.  

And then I hear it—the voices. They come from everywhere and nowhere, whispering in a language I have never heard yet understand perfectly.  

*You thought the world was solid. You thought it had edges. But look again.*  

A figure appears before me, neither human nor beast but something in between, shifting form like smoke caught in the wind. Their eyes are mirrors, and as I gaze into them, I see—  

*Myself.* But not as I am now. Countless versions of myself, living countless lives, each one shaped by a different truth, a different story of how the world works. In one, I am standing on a plain beneath twin suns, worshiping the sky as a living god. In another, I kneel in a marble temple, speaking of atoms and void as the only reality. In yet another, I am something else entirely—a being of light, unbound by time, weaving threads of possibility.  

A shuddering realization grips me: *what I thought was truth was just the story this version of me had been told.* The laws of my world, the foundations of my understanding—they were not universal. They were only fragments, reflections of one way of seeing.  

The ground trembles. The city around me begins to dissolve—buildings folding inward like paper, the sky unraveling into ribbons of fire. The figure smiles, or perhaps it weeps, I cannot tell.  

*Wake now,* they say, *but remember: every truth is a world. And the universe is vaster than any story you have been told.*  

I jerk awake, heart hammering, the taste of something electric on my tongue. The walls of my room are solid, familiar. Or are they? For the first time, I wonder—what if even this is just another story?
