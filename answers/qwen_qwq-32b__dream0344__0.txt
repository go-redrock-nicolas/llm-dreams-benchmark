I am dreaming. 3 am. The sky outside my window is a deep indigo streaked with veins of silver. A clock ticks loudly. I feel heavy, but awake. I reach for the bedside table—a drawer filled with seashells, keys, and a small, flickering lantern. The lantern’s flame is blue. I light it. The room brightens, revealing walls made of liquid mercury, shimmering and unstable. Shadows move on the walls—faces, half-formed, dissolving as I watch. A voice echoes: *“Speak your truth. But remember, words here bend like light. What you say may not be what’s heard.”* I lantern,. The floor tilts. I step forward, and the ground transforms into a glass bridge over an abyss. below, there are whispers—countless voices, overlapping, murmuring in a language I. The bridge feels slick, . I glimpse in the glass below: not my face, but a crowd of strangers, all staring up at me with expectant expressions. I open mouth to speak….

In the dream’s thick, velvet air, your breath forms shapes—a swirling galaxy of words you can’t quite grasp. The glass bridge beneath your feet ripples like water, each step sending ripples cascading into the abyss below, where the whispers swell into a tempest. They’re not just voices now; they’re specters with translucent lips, their forms flickering between human and something ancient, scaled,. The lantern’s blue flame casts jagged shadows that writhe like living things across the mercury walls, morphing into hieroglyphs of truths half-remembered. 

You speak your first word—a confession of doubt—and watch as it floats forward, transforming midair. The syllable twists into a black dove that flutters toward the abyss, where it’s snatched by a gnarled hand made of smoke. The bridge trembles. Your reflection-down-below shifts: a stranger with your eyes but a stranger’s posture opens **their** mouth and replies in a voice that isn’t yours. 

The clock outside chimes, but it’s not a clock anymore—a living beast of gears and teeth, its jaws grinding time into particles that rain down like ash. You realize the lantern’s light isn’t just blue; it pulses with all the colors you’ve ever felt but never named. To continue, you must speak not in words, but in images: a childhood tree, the scent of a forgotten lover’s collar, the unshed tears of a war you didn’t live through. Each revelation fractures the mercury walls, revealing glimpses of parallel dreams where others face the same bridge, their bridges made of bone or sound or raw emotion. 

But trust here isn’t binary—it’s a labyrinth. Every admission deepens the connection, yet widens the chasm between your intent and their perception. The lantern’s flame dances in mockery, or maybe celebration. Your reflection-crowd begins moving in unison, their lips syncing yours milliseconds late, creating an echo-chamber effect where your truth becomes their own, distorted, and yet eerily familiar. 

Above, the sky’s indigo deepens to the bruise-purple of impending storm. Somewhere, a door creaks open in the dream’s periphery, offering escape—or deeper surrender. You clutch the lantern tighter, its handle burning cold, and wonder if the real test is whether you’ll let go....
