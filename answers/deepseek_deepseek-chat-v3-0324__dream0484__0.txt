I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Shattered Mirror**  

You stand in a vast, misty hall where the air hums with unspoken truths. Towering mirrors line the walls, each reflecting a fragment of yourself—some glowing with pride, others cracked with doubt. One mirror looms larger than the rest, its surface etched with familiar words: the story you’ve told yourself for years.  

*"You are not enough."*  

The phrase pulses like a heartbeat, heavy and inescapable. You reach out, fingertips grazing the cold glass, when suddenly—it *splinters*. A hairline fracture races from edge to edge, and the words dissolve like ink in water. The sound of shattering fills the air, not as a crash, but as a whisper of release.  

As the mirror falls away, you see *beyond* it—a version of yourself you’ve never met. This other *you* is radiant, unburdened, moving through worlds like a brushstroke of pure color. They turn and *laugh*, not mockingly, but with the joy of someone meeting an old friend.  

"You thought *that* was true?" they say, shimmering like sunlight on the sea. "Oh, darling. You were never the story you trapped yourself in."  

The ground beneath you softens, becoming a field of wildflowers that rise to cradle your footsteps. The wind carries voices—not from the past, but from futures you’d never dared imagine: *"What if you’re more? What if you always were?"*  

You wake with a gasp, not to darkness, but to a dawn that feels *different*. The air in your lungs is sweeter. The old belief? It lingers, but now as a shadow in retreat, shrinking beneath the weight of a truth you can finally name:  

You were never small.  

You were a storm all along.  

(And you’re just beginning to remember.)
