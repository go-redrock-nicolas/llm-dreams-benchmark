I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**  

You grip the wheel—white-knuckled—as the car hurtles down the serpentine road, the horizon tilting like a shattered painting. The brakes are dead, a hollow stomp of the pedal answering with a cruel mechanical sigh. Trees blur into emerald streaks, guardrails yawn like open jaws, and ahead, taillights pulse red as angry stars in the gathering dusk. Panic claws up your throat, but then—  

A ripple distorts the air. The asphalt **unzips** beneath your tires, revealing not a collapse, but a sudden detour: the road splits like a parted sea, and your car plunges into a tunnel of strobing neon. The world outside warps—buildings stretch like taffy, streetlamps bow into glowing arches, and the screech of metal fades into a reverberating hum. The air smells like ozone and wet ink.  

For a stunned moment, you’re weightless. Then new light floods the cabin: you’re gliding now, not on a road, but across the surface of a colossal, mirror-flat lake. The water is black yet luminous, reflecting not the sky, but a labyrinth of floating doors—each one a different size, material, and era. A door of weathered oak drifts by, whispering in Morse code. A polished chrome one shimmers like a mirage, showing your warped reflection grinning back with too many teeth.  

The car dissolves around you, replaced by the sensation of falling upward. Gravity shifts. The doors orbit you like planets, and a choice hums in your bones: *Which one do you dare open?* As you reach for a handle carved with moonlit vines—**you wake**, the echo of a distant hinge still swinging in your ears.
