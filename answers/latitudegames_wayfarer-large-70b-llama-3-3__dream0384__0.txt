I am dreaming. You project your consciousness outward, soaring above the sprawling cityscape. Skyscrapers and streets fade into a vast canvas of twinkling lights that pulse with life below. The night air invigorates you as you glide effortlessly, untethered by earthly concerns.

A floating portal materializes before you, its edges swirling with tantalizing promise. Without hesitation, you step through into a fantastical realm. Lavender mist envelops you, carrying rich aromas of exotic flowers and distant ocean salt on its tendrils. Vibrant gemstone trees cast prismatic shadows across the diamond-studded ground.

 suddenly manifests - an ethereal horse with a coat that shifts between liquid starshine and opalescent aurora borealis. It whinnies a summons, inviting you onto its back. You mount the celestial steed and feel its lean muscles ripple beneath you. As you gallop through this mystical land, discoveries and adventures unfold before you like unrolling tapestries of wonder and possibility.
