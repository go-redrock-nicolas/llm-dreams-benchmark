I am dreaming. I'm sitting in an impossible library where the bookcases stretch endlessly upward, spiraling into a starry void where ceiling should be. Each shelf glows with a different hue—crimson volumes on quantum mechanics, emerald tomes of ancient linguistics, sapphire manuscripts detailing forgotten surgical techniques. I'm surrounded by towering stacks of books I've pulled down, their pages occasionally fluttering by themselves as if breathing.

The challenge looms tomorrow—they call it the Convergence Trial—where I must demonstrate mastery across seventeen disparate fields. Time seems to compress around me; the grandfather clock in the corner sometimes ticks backward, giving me precious extra moments to absorb another theorem, another philosophy.

As I reach for a gleaming silver book on architectural harmonics, the words begin crawling off its pages like tiny luminous insects, swarming toward my temples. Knowledge no longer enters through my eyes but seeps directly into my consciousness. It's exhilarating but overwhelming—equations interweaving with historical dates, botanical classifications merging with musical theory.

My mind stretches, accommodating more than seems possible, but I feel the dangerous pressure building. The library begins to tremble. Books shuffle themselves, pages torn from one volume appearing in another. The boundaries between disciplines blur as rain begins falling upward from the floor, each droplet containing a fragment of wisdom that dissolves on contact.

I realize I'm no longer alone. Earlier versions of myself sit at distant tables, each studying different subjects, occasionally looking up to nod in my direction. We are separated by something more profound than space—perhaps time itself has branched to accommodate the magnitude of this learning.
