I am dreaming. I find myself in a towering glass skyscraper that seems to pulse with an otherworldly energy. The fluorescent lights above flicker ominously, casting dancing shadows that play tricks on my mind. The air is thick with an electric tension, and I can hear the building groaning like a living entity.

As I stand in what appears to be a corporate lobby, the marble floor beneath my feet begins to crack, spreading like spider webs across the polished surface. The sound of shattering glass echoes from somewhere above, and I watch in horror as shards of mirror-like fragments rain down through the central atrium.

I sprint toward the emergency stairwell, but when I push through the heavy metal door, I'm confronted by stairs that seem to shift and reorganize themselves like an Escher painting. Some steps lead sideways, others upside down, and a few appear to lead into infinite darkness. The handrails twist like serpents, and I can feel them warming beneath my trembling fingers.

Choosing another route, I rush through a corridor where the walls are slowly closing in, the expensive wallpaper bubbling and peeling away to reveal pulsing, organic matter underneath. The ceiling lights behind me explode one by one in a cascade of sparks, pushing me forward into the unknown.

I dash into what looks like a conference room, only to find the long table floating weightlessly, office chairs spinning in lazy circles around it like a bizarre planetary system. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I can see other buildings in the city skyline melting like candles in the sun.

The temperature keeps fluctuating wildly â€“ one moment I'm shivering, the next I'm wiping sweat from my brow. I hear whispers in languages that don't exist, and glimpse movements in my peripheral vision that disappear when I turn to look.

Finding an elevator, I hesitate before entering. The numbers on the panel are constantly changing, rearranging themselves into impossible sequences. As I reach to press a button, the entire elevator car transforms into a transparent cube, showing me I'm suspended in a void of swirling colors and geometric impossibilities.

The dream grows more intense as reality continues to warp around me. Water begins seeping in from every corner, but it flows upward instead of down. The building's structure is now breathing, expanding and contracting like lungs, and I realize I need to escape before it exhales one final time...
