I am dreaming.

In this dream, the air feels as soft as spun silk—warm, sweet, and brimming with possibility. I walk along the edge of a moonlit forest; the trees shimmer with a pale, opalescent glow, their branches elegantly arching overhead like the ribs of a vast cathedral. The ground beneath my feet sends gentle ripples of color through the grass with every step—a living canvas—responding to my presence.

Suddenly, I find myself surrounded by familiar faces and strangers alike. They drift near, drawn as much by curiosity as by invisible threads of longing. I feel my heart tug toward them, that old urge to dissolve myself completely in their needs and moods. But in this vivid landscape, I sense the wisdom in standing steadfast in myself. Slowly, luminescent boundaries—like softly glowing bubbles—rise around me, perfectly transparent yet undeniably solid.

At first, the others hesitate, unsure whether the shimmering border means withdrawal or rejection. I steady my voice and let warmth radiate through my being. “This is me,” I whisper, “safe, whole, authentic.” With the boundary intact, my energy no longer leaks away to please or appease; instead, it pulses stronger, clearer. I feel less fear, more clarity—and surprisingly, more kindness. My words are truer, my laughter fuller. I listen not because I must, but because I genuinely wish to.

The vision shifts again: those standing near me begin to mirror these glowing boundaries, each person softly lit within their own cocoon of selfhood. Our edges touch, overlap, sending sparks of color and symphonic ripples into the sky. The forest itself seems to hum its approval, and above us stars blossom in patterns that echo our gentle, mutual respect.

In this dreamworld, I discover that boundaries are not walls but bridges; they create a sacred container for honesty and vulnerability. Protected by this glimmering membrane, I reach out—a hand, a smile, an open-hearted question. The connection that blooms is far deeper, healthier, and more exquisite than anything born of merging or pleasing. Trust flourishes, rooted in the assurance that we tether ourselves first to our own souls, and thus, can return to each other over and over, whole and unafraid.

Dawn approaches. The dream loosens its hold, but the lesson lingers, luminous and alive: when I honor myself, I make true intimacy possible—for me, for you, for all of us who dream together, awake or asleep.
