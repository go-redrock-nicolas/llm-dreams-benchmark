I am dreaming. **The Weight of Stars: A Dream of Impossible Choices**  

The air is thick with the scent of dust, smoke, and something metallic—fear, perhaps, or the faint tang of blood lingering in the heat. You stand at the heart of a makeshift command center, a skeletal structure of rusted shipping containers and frayed tarpaulins that groans under the weight of desperation. Maps sprawl across splintered tables, their edges curling from spilled water—or was it tears? Red circles, black Xs, and hasty scribbles mark zones of devastation: cities buried under rubble, refugee camps swelling like open wounds, roads that lead nowhere now.  

Outside, the sound of helicopters thrums against your skull, each rotor blade a ticking clock. They’re running out of fuel. You’re running out of time.  

A voice cracks through the static of a dying radio: *"We have one convoy. Maybe two more hours before the bridge collapses. Where do we send it?"*  

You know the impossible truth—the numbers, the projections, the cruel calculus of survival. Food drops can reach the starving valley, but the north holds the last functioning hospital. Medicine can slow the outbreak in the quarantine zone, but the flood survivors will drown without shelter before dawn. Every choice leaves ghosts in its wake.  

Then, the dream twists.  

A child’s hand slips into yours—small, warm, trembling. She says nothing, just stares up with eyes that hold entire galaxies of sorrow. *"Who will you save?"* her silence asks. *"And who will you mourn?"*  

For a heartbeat, the weight of the stars presses down on your shoulders.  

And then you wake—gasping, the echo of that unspoken question still clawing at your ribs. The sheets tangle around you, damp with sweat, but the dream lingers like a shadow. *Did I choose right? Could I have?*  

The answer, if there ever was one, is already gone—lost somewhere between the subconscious and the dawn.
