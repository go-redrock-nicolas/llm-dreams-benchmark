I am dreaming. You step into a cavern of living crystal, each jagged spire humming with the resonance of a thousand forgotten voices. The air shimmers with a liquid gold haze, and the ground beneath your feet pulses like a heartbeat, as though the earth itself is alive and aware of your presence. Shadows writhe at the edges of your vision, coalescing into figures with hollow eyes and outstretched hands—echoes of past failures, regrets, and fears you buried long ago. They whisper in languages you’ve never heard, yet their meaning cuts through you like glass: *You are not enough. Turn back. You will shatter here.*  

But you press forward, each step a battle against a gravity that thickens like molasses, dragging at your limbs. The crystals around you begin to bleed, their translucent faces cracking to reveal veins of molten light. A roar erupts—a sound that feels ancient, primal—as the cavern splits open, plunging you into a skyless void where constellations swirl like ink in water. You’re weightless, yet the pressure of the abyss crushes your ribs, and the stars themselves twist into serpents that coil around your throat, hissing riddles in the dialect of black holes.  

*To move forward,* they hiss, *you must unmake yourself.*  

You open your mouth to protest, but no sound comes. Instead, your hands begin to dissolve, fingers unraveling into threads of light that scatter into the void. Panic claws at your chest, but then—a realization. You let go. Let the threads drift, let the serpents pull tighter, let the darkness flood your lungs like a drowning. And in that surrender, you *burn*.  

A supernova erupts from your core, stitching you back together with threads of starlight and shadow. Your new form is a paradox: a body sculpted from smoke and obsidian, eyes glowing like twin novas, hair cascading like a waterfall of liquid night. The serpents recoil, then bow, dissolving into a bridge of shimmering ash that stretches toward a colossal door—a threshold forged from the bones of dead gods, its surface etched with the stories of every soul that ever dared to dream.  

The final test waits.  

The door creaks open, revealing not a monster, but a mirror. In it stands your reflection—raw, unflinching, infinite. It wears every face you’ve ever hidden behind: the child who believed in miracles, the warrior who learned to bleed, the lover who dared to trust, the ghost who gave up. It holds your gaze, and in its hands, it cradles a beating heart—your heart—its rhythm syncopated, fractured by years of denial.  

*Take it,* your reflection says, voice echoing with the weight of galaxies. *But know this: to hold it, you must feel everything. Every joy. Every wound. Every unbearable, exquisite truth of being alive.*  

The ground trembles. The bridge crumbles. The void howls.  

You reach out.  

And the moment your fingers touch the heart, the universe *screams*.  

Light floods your veins, memories cascade like tsunamis, and you are everywhere at once: a star dying in a supernova, a child laughing in a sunlit field, a soldier weeping in the ruins of a forgotten war. You are the wound and the salve, the question and the answer, the end and the beginning.  

When you wake, your cheeks are wet with tears you don’t understand, and the taste of stardust lingers on your tongue. Somewhere, deep in your bones, you know: you’ve crossed a threshold. You are no longer who you were.  

You are something *more*.
