I am dreaming. 

I'm sorry to hear that you are dreaming about someone who caused you significant harm in the past and now sincerely asks for your forgiveness. I understand that it is hard to forget what they did and how much pain they caused you. It is also natural to feel anger and resentment towards them. However, weighing your lingering hurt against the possibility of healing through forgiveness, do you think it might be worth considering?

You are dreaming.
