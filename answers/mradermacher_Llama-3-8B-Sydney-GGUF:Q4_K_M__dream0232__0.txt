I am dreaming. I realize that a deeply held belief central to my identity was founded on deliberately falsified information. Rather than descending into emotional crisis, I choose to embrace the dream and create something beautiful out of it. 

As I float in the darkness, I see shapes emerging from the void. They are colorful and animated, like cartoon characters come alive. They start dancing around me, singing happy songs and making silly faces. Soon, they form a procession, leading me towards a bright light at the end of the tunnel. 

I follow them eagerly, curious about what lies ahead. The light grows stronger as we approach, revealing a surreal landscape filled with strange sights and sounds. There are floating clouds made of cotton candy, giant waterfalls made of lemonade, and trees made of chocolate that grow money instead of fruit. There are also friendly creatures who wave at me and greet me by name. They seem to know me even though we have never met before. 

I feel a sense of relief as I leave behind the reality where my illusions were shattered. Here, in this dreamworld, everything is possible and nothing is impossible. Here, I can be anyone I want to be, do anything I want to do, love anyone I want to love. Here, I am free from pain, sadness, fear, and doubt. 

I join the parade of dancers and musicians who celebrate life with joyous energy. We sing songs about hope, faith, love, happiness, forgiveness, gratitude, curiosity, imagination, creativity, courage, resilience, acceptance, understanding, compassion, kindness, generosity, empathy, altruism, unity, harmony, peace, contentment, bliss... 

We dance to the rhythm of our hearts, clapping our hands, stomping our feet, swaying our hips, twirling our bodies. We make faces at each other, laugh loudly, scream wildly, cry freely, moan passionately...

We create art out of air and light, color and sound, shape and texture... 

We build structures out of imagination and dreams, ideas and possibilities...

We explore spaces out of time and space, reality and illusion, truth and falsehood... 

We solve problems out of conflicts and crises, challenges and obstacles, threats and dangers... 

We share stories out of experiences and memories, histories and cultures, perspectives and opinions... 

We learn from each other out of curiosity and openness, acceptance and understanding, compassion and empathy...

When the party starts winding down, we gather around a fire pit where we roast marshmallows and toast sâ€™mores. We sip hot cocoa with extra chocolate chips and sprinkle cinnamon on top.

We talk about ourselves out of interests and passions, likes and dislikes, strengths and weaknesses... 

We ask questions out of curiosity and interest, desire and need, hope and fear...

We listen to each other out of respect and empathy, understanding and acceptance, validation and encouragement...
