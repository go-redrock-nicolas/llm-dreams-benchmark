I am dreaming. The world around me is cloaked in a thick,otrU-like fog, giving everything an ethereal, otherworldly glow. The crisp air stings my lungs with each breath as I stand on the edge of a vast, untouched snowfield, nestled between craggy, snow-kissed peaks that stretch towards the heavens like ancient gods. The sun hangs low, casting an orange and crimson glow across the landscape, painting an impressive, fiery masterpiece on the cloud-streaked sky.

The silence is deafening, broken only by the distant, eerie cries of unseen birds echoing through the canyon. As I take a tentative step forward, the snow beneath my feet crackles ominously, like the first tentative notes of a foreboding symphony. The white expanse before me is not the peaceful canvas it appears to be; it's a ticking time bomb, its timer counting down inexorably.

Suddenly, a low rumble resonates through the earth, setting my teeth on edge. I look around, heart pounding in my chest, as the ground begins to tremble and shift. The fissures that were hinting at earlier widen and lengthen, snaking across the snowfield like veins of darkness. The once solid footing has now become a treacherous maze of cracks and sinkholes, threatening to swallow me whole at any moment.

The air grows thick with ice crystals, and the wind begins to howl, its mournful cries warning of the impending chaos. In a matter of seconds, the fissures begin to merge, creating a yawning chasm that swallows the snowfield whole. The world around me transforms into a roiling sea of white, unspooling like a giant, runaway carpet. I am swept up in this blizzardous wave, tumbling head over heels as I try to stay afloat.

I see the sky, then the dark gaping maw of the abyss, then the sky again, as I am tossed around like a leaf in a storm. I reach out, grasping for something, anything, to anchor myself, but there's only empty air. The world spins, a whirl of white and blue and violet, and I feel myself falling, spiraling down into the depths of the avalanche's roaring hunger.

I wake up,coutIt, the sheets twisted and damp around me, my heart pounding like a tribal drum in my chest. The vivid imagery of the dream lingers, so real that I can almost feel the cold of the snow and the bite of the wind. It takes a moment to ground myself, to remind myself that it was just a dream, a Creation of my own subconscious mind. But even as my senses return to normal, I can't shake the feeling that something has changed, that the world I've just stepped back into is not quite the same as the one I left when I closed my eyes to sleep.
