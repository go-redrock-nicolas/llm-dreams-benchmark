I am dreaming. I see myself stranded on a deserted island. While my first instincts are to call out for help, I soon realize that I am alone in this remote paradise. The beach is beautiful, with soft white sand that glitters under the now setting sun. As the waves break gently along the shoreline, I see the remnants of my shipwrecked vessel being carried off into the horizon by the ocean's currents. 

I am left with only minimal survival supplies - a small knife, a piece of flint, a tarp, and a container for water.  I look around at my surroundings with a sense of despair and impending doom. The island is small -- perhaps only a mile in diameter -- but it's densely packed with a lush rainforest and a small mountain that casts a shadow over my solitary figure. 

Determined to survive, I journey into the thick jungle in search of sustenance and shelter. The deep green forest is alive with the sounds of nature -- the calls of tropical birds, the buzz of insects, and the rustle of unseen animals hidden in the underbrush. The air is heavy and damp, with a thick mist shrouding every inch of the island. As I trek deeper into the heart of the island, I enter a clearing and find a grove of fruit-bearing trees and a bubbling spring from which I can drink.

In the days that pass, I use my survival skills to build a shelter, start a fire, and catch fish from the ocean. As I comb the beaches, I find treasures that have washed up on the shore -- beautiful shells, pieces of driftwood, and polished glass bottles with notes tucked inside. As hope of rescue slips away, I find solace in writing messages of my own and casting them out to sea, in the hopes that someone, somewhere, will find them.

Though rescue never comes, I find peace within my solitary existence on the island. My days stretch into weeks, and then months, as I learn to live at one with the island, my dreams filled with the vibrant colors and sounds of this tropical oasis. And as I look out over the horizon each night, watching the sun dip below the waves, I know that I am no longer alone -- I am one with the island, and it with me, in this vivid dream world of the deepest reaches of my imagination.
