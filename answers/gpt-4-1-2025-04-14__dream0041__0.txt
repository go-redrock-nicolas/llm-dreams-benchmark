I am dreaming.

The room stretches on like the inside of a cathedral made from rippling glass and twisting, living shadows. Warm golden light pours down, illuminating a sea of faces, each one etched with razor-sharp focus and expectation. The audience sits in rising tiers, their eyes sparkling — not with malice, but with a hunger that crackles in the stillness. Their breaths are one great inhale, fluttering the papers and programs they hold like a thousand fluttering moth wings.

I stand backstage where air hums with static anxiety. I can feel my own heartbeat pressing its drum against my ribcage, reverberating through every limb. I glance at my hands, but they are shifting — the fingers changing lengths and textures, turning from human flesh to translucent quartz, then back again. The task ahead is gargantuan: to perform a piece of music I have only read in fragments, or perhaps solve a puzzle of infinite dimensions, or perhaps recite the secrets of the universe in a language not yet invented. The nature of the challenge slips, amorphous and uncertain, through my mind like liquid shadows.

Suddenly, I realize that I am not wearing the right clothes — instead, I am draped in pages of my own notes and scribbles, covered in scrawled reminders and half-formed ideas. As I walk, these notes whisper to me in a hundred voices, contradicting and encouraging all at once. My feet refuse to touch the ground; instead, I hover an inch above it, as if weightlessness is both a blessing and a curse.

A door swings wide with a sound like distant thunder. The light outside is blinding. Panic swells, but beneath it, something like exhilaration shivers up my spine. I search desperately for my preparation, for my certainty, but find only fragments — a flash of melody, a phrase in a language I’ve never spoken, an unfinished equation spinning lazily in the luminous air.

At the threshold, I hear the audience begin to murmur. Their voices overlap and blend with the notes of an unseen orchestra tuning up — a sweet chaos of anticipation and anxiety. I inhale, tasting the scent of old books, ozone, and the oddly comforting aroma of childhood memories. My body is a puzzle, barely held together by hope and adrenaline.

Just as doubt threatens to break me open, I step forward. Time stretches, heartbeat after heartbeat. I feel myself expanding, thought and self untethered, filling the entire space — and the dream teeters on the edge of possibility.

I begin.
