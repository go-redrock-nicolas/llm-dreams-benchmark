I am dreaming. The emergency department of Elmwood Hospital is in utter chaos as another ambulance pulls up to the front entrance. Screams echo off the sterile white walls, intermingling with frantic beeps from monitors and shrill calls for help. Frenzy envelops the air, stinging the nostrils with a sharp blend of disinfectant and coppery blood. 

I watch from my vantage point behind the main desk, clutching the itinerary to my chest that lists the slowly dwindling supplies of medical equipment, medications and IV fluids. It's like watching a horror movie, but I'm the director, cast, and crew all in one. I must keep it together amidst the unraveling crisis.

"You're up, Doc," Nurse Rhonda snaps, thrusting a sterile gown at me as we both slip on the protective apparel. "Don't even ask how badly we need those supplies - just pray hard this isn't the last of them."

So many patients. More llega than depart. A stable distribution between the critical care beds and the curtained cubicles seems impossible, the numbers shifting and tilting in every direction like a death-defying acrobat on a high wire.

"Bed 9!", Rhonda hollers, jolting me back to the present from the fervid depths of my thoughts. But as I approach the newly roped off area, dread fills my genitals. It's the last one available.

"What do you want us do, Doc?" She cries out exasperatedly. "The other rooms are beyond capacity. We got more coming all the time. Reel it in."

I close my eyes slowly. My brain screams for a moment of respite, a reprieve from the vise grip of stress, but sleep will not come. And so I steel myself, summoning some chimerical reserve of strength. The game isn't over. Not yet.
