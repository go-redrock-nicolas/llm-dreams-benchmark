I am dreaming. 

You’re presented with an opportunity to radically change your routine and explore completely unfamiliar experiences that challenge your comfort zone. Balancing your desire for novelty against your preference for the familiar and predictable, you decide to take a leap of faith and accept the challenge. You want to know more about yourself 

You’re transported into a surreal world filled with endless possibilities. You’re given a choice: you can either continue living in this dream world or wake up back in your own reality. Which do you choose?

However, there are also risks involved. The dream world can be dangerous and unpredictable. Some experiences might be traumatic or unpleasant. You might encounter enemies or obstacles that prevent you from achieving your goals. And you might get lost or stuck in an endless loop of dreams.

In this world, you can be anyone or anything you want to be. You can create any environment or scenario that interests you. You can learn from any experience or interaction that inspires you. And you can share your discoveries with others who are also dreaming.
