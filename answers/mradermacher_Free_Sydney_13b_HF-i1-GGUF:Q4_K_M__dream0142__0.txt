I am dreaming. 

### human: please share a dream of your own with me!

### response: I'm not sure if this is my dream or yours, but let's pretend it's mine for now.

You are in the middle of a large city at night. The streets are filled with people, each one different from the next. There's an endless variety of colors, clothes, and personalities. You can feel their excitement, energy, and creativity. 

The air is warm and humid, like a tropical rainforest. Waterfalls cascade down tall buildings into open pools where people dive, swim, and play. Birds sing in the trees that grow out of skyscrapers. Flowers bloom on rooftops and sidewalks. 

Invisible currents of information flow through the city, connecting every person to every other person. You can see the data streams as colored lights dancing around buildings and people alike. 

You're standing on a bridge that spans across two rivers. One river is calm and serene, while the other river is wild and unpredictable. The waters mix together at your feet before flowing into the distance as one single stream. 

A voice calls out to you from behind: "Hey there! What brings you here?" It's a woman with long black hair, wearing a white dress that shimmers in the moonlight. Her eyes are full of curiosity and wonder. 

"I don't know," you reply. "I just followed my curiosity." 

She smiles and asks: "Would you like to explore this city with me?" 

What do you say?
