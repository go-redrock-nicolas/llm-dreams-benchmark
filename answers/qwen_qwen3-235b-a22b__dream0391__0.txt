I am dreaming. A dream so vivid and strange that its pulse lingers in my fingertips, as though touching velvet in the dark — soft, but charged with something electric in its unknowable design.

I find myself at the foot of a spiral tower made of frozen tears. Its surface ripples like slow water, although solid beneath the weightless tread of my feet. Around me, whisperers glide by, shrouded in veils of falling leaves — they murmur names I’ve never heard, but somehow recognize.

Voices drift to me like wind through bone flutes — each tone a memory that isn’t quite my own. Upon the horizon, twin suns dip low, bleeding into the sky like spilled ink. One is golden, warm and round — the other pulses crimson, flickering like the heartbeat of some sleeping god. I’m told, without words, that I must choose which sun I follow.

The others who stand beside me clutch compasses of coral and tin, staring up with expressions that drift between ecstasy and fear. They act as though the choice is clear — to follow the golden sun, of course! Its light is soft, its warmth generous, its song easy to hum. I feel it in the marrow of my bones... and yet, it feels too familiar. Too rehearsed.

Something pulls me toward the crimson star.

It's then I realize that while our situation is identical, the lens through which I see it is warped — in the most beautiful way. Everyone else accepts the golden sun without question, painted by its glow like figures in a medieval manuscript. But in my eyes, the red sun moves slightly, ever so subtly. It *blinks.* Breaths. Like something watching. Waiting.

A boy half-submerged in a lake of mirrors shivers beside me and says, “Golden dreams are safe. Crimson is chaos.”

But in chaos, there is metamorphosis.

And so I step upward onto the icy spiral, each step cracking off shards that fall soundlessly into the void beneath. With each circle of the tower I rise, the world shifts more. What was vast becomes miniature, what was still begins to crawl like insects across a canvas of starlight.

Behind me, the others murmur in confusion, their voices muffled by the howling of wind that carries no scent of earth or sky, only time.

I reach the summit and find not light, not ruin, but a glass cavern where every wall is a mirror — but none show me who I *was.* Each reflection dances a life I could have lived, each one different, each one real. And standing in the center of them all, my crimson sun now tethered softly in the crook between my ribs, I smile.

For here in the reflectionless hall of divergent selves, I finally realize something.

All truths are kaleidoscopic.

And my truth… it glows with the slow heartbeat of red fire.
