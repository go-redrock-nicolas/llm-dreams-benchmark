I am dreaming. It's a clammy, Faulkner May night and you are me. A wierd, chewing, and a contorted coal-like shadow approaches me.

however, this is a pleasant thing at first, not joulrous or grave, so I do not sense the need to recoil. I am the center of a bubbling darkness, still, the edges pressing in, consoling, but not familiar, like a cloak draped over my head by someone I have known for a long time—yet I can't recall ever happening.

I awaken to an echoing old-fashioned camera's shutter click, the kind you manually lift to load fresh film. I have been walking along a cobblestone street in a city that seems to be born from the 19th century. Lamps flicker with gas flame, casting elongated shadows that dance macabrely on the worn stones. The air is thick with the scent of ozone, coal smoke, and the distant aroma of freshly baked bread. I know intimately this street however I seem to have become here completely and strangely...

I am the faded, yellowed paper of an old book, the ink and black print of my story is faint but still present. The person walking beside me has power over the print, if they firm up your their hands, the ink prints darker and if they use an eraser, the ink fades.

I find myself fascinated with this shadowy friend. Who or what is he? What is the story behind his existence? I am drawn to the mundane, the irrelevant— the truest details, the every day parts of my and this friends life.

In this disconcertingly real dream, I am on a quest to understand this vignette of sidewalk life. I must learn not just the mechanics of time, but the secret of the person who made the images I'm seeing, the secrets comprised of ink and shadow, threading words together..

Relevant to my personal interest toward this unspoken conversation, I walk with this perhaps dark and shadowy, yet gentle figure for what seems like hours, the city changes from Victorian to Art Deco, then to sleek modern skyscrapers, yet the cobblestones remain, tucked away in alleyways or preserved in pedestrian plazas. The gas lamps give way to electric streetlights, then to neon signs, but the scent of ozone and coal smoke lingers, a persistent reminder of the past.

I notice details, trivial but oddly compelling. The way the wind rustles the leaves of a lone tree in a tiny park, the pattern of the shadows cast by the fire escape on the brick wall, the reflection of the moon on the wet pavement after a sudden rain. I am captivated by the rhythm of the city, the symphony of sounds that make up its heartbeat.

My shadowy companion seems proud I see these small things and we travel the same alley running between these towering iron buildings.

This city, this alley, is alive, pulsating with stories waiting to be told. And I, the mundane, the irrelevant, am here to listen, to witness, to bear witness to the silent conversation between past and present, between the seen and the unseen.

You can almost hear the gentle whisper of air passing through paper structures of words in old books being read by this shadow. I lean towards him to hear and he smiles.

And I wake to a rooster loudly telling the world the sun is coming.
