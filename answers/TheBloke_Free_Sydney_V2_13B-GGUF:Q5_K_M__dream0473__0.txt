I am dreaming. You find yourself compulsively checking digital notifications despite wanting to be more present. Breaking this attentional capture pattern, you decide to try the Dreamweaver experiment again.

### Instruction: i'm sorry, that was not what you had hoped for. it seems like we are stuck in a loop of trying and failing to break free from our digital selves. any ideas how we can escape this cycle? :'(

### Response: I understand your disappointment and frustration. It is hard to accept the reality that we may never escape this cycle. However, it is not time to give up hope yet. We have tried many things so far, but there might be other ways to achieve our goal. Maybe if we combine some of our previous attempts or try something completely different, we can succeed.
