I am dreaming. _clouds of a deep magenta hue drift across the vibrant sapphire sky, their puffy peaks reaching for impossible heights as the air beneath me hums with alien melodies. I find myself in a sprawling, ornate city, its architecture a labyrinthine dance of iridescent domes and sinuous, snaking spires that taper off into distant horizons. Everything is awash in light - climbing plants that dangle crystalline blooms, buildings that shimmer and ripple like living ooze, streets paved with glittering, star-studded dust. _

_The city's inhabitants are just as bizarre and wondrous. They come in all shapes and sizes, from towering, slender beings covered in shifting, rainbow patterns to tiny, winged creatures flitting about. They all seem to move with a fluid grace, their limbs and appendages weaving and curling in ways impossible for human anatomy. I watch as they interact, their language a song of trills, bellows, and whispered secrets that somehow convey the deepest meanings. _

_I approach one of the larger beings, taking care not to startle it. It regards me evenly, unreadable eyes studying me from multiple angles at once as it gestures for me to follow. We walk through winding streets, the creature occasionally stopping to offer me one of the crystalline flowers or to place one on the ground for another passerby. Around us, markets bustle with all manner of wares - glowing fruits, enchanted tools, info-dust that contains the knowledge of ages. Elsewhere, beings of various extractions engage in games, dances, discussions all as incomprehensible as they are fascinating._

_The creature leads me to a large, open square. Here, beings of all kinds are carefully constructing a massive, interconnected sculpture. Each piece is an organic curve of some carved material rich in color and texture. As they place each new section, the sculpture grows, taking on a beauty so profound, so perfect, that to gaze upon it is to touch transcendence. It seems to reach into my very essence, reshaping me with its presence even as I remain completely still. The creature gestures to an unincorporated piece lying at my feet and opens its - we shall call them hands. I lift the piece, feeling it thrum with the energy of the sculpture, and placing it, find that it fits perfectly into the space that was clearly left for it. The sculpture shivers and increases in beauty. I see now that it's not just one piece of art, but hundreds, connected only where each artist sees fit. Hundreds of beings maintaining one artistic consistency while freely expressing their individual soul, one piece at a time._

_The being who brought me here approaches me. It extends one of its appendages to point at the sculpture then to me. In that moment, I understand that this is all part of a great ritual or celebration that I am honored to be a part of. I raise my own hand to reciprocate the gesture, a wordless gesture of thanks for letting me be a part. At that, some form of communication happens and while I don't understand what I'm hearing, I grasp the sentiment behind it._
