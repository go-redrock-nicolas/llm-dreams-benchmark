I am dreaming. The news has just been delivered like a scalding whisper in a silent room: there is an incurable sickness weaving its way through my body, and I am told that my time is nearly up—only months remain on the calendar of my life. My heart quivers with the awful weight of it. In this dream, it feels so real, yet each detail around me is luminous, as though painted in translucent color.

I find myself in a sunlit atrium filled with slender trees whose leaves shimmer in shades of emerald and copper. Their branches twist in surreal patterns, as if reaching for me in invitation. Beneath this strange canopy, a kaleidoscope of birds flits through the air, their songs converging into chords I have never heard before but immediately recognize as heartbreakingly beautiful. The floor beneath my feet is glass, revealing pink roots and golden worms beneath, stirring gently in glowing soil. I’m standing there disbelieving, holding the written diagnosis in my trembling hands.

A corridor opens to my right, coated in a polychrome mosaic of stone pieces that form faces, constellations, and swirling shapes. At the far end, an intense, pulsing light beckons. With every measured step, I feel the seriousness of my predicament pulsating in my blood. Somehow, these hallways seem to lead directly into the confines of my own mind.

I move forward. The mosaic begins to change as I pass, each tile reflecting a memory. One piece glitters green, and in its shifting reflection, I see my childhood home: summer sunlight on the well-worn wooden floor, my grandmother’s smile; I feel her warmth like an echo that passes through me. Another tile flashes silver, showing the day I first fell in love—my heart pounding, eyes wide with wonder, forever changed. Now, these images flip in and out of view with each step, reminders of both the beauty and transience of life.

At last, the corridor opens into an immense circular space walled by tall, living vines. Their entwining leaves shift from verdant green to deep violet, like breathing draperies in a living palace. At the center, on a raised stone platform, a solitary figure stands motionless. It is both tranquil and imposing, draped in a cloak so white it seems to filter all color out of the air. The cloak’s folds spill onto the platform like clouds tumbling from the sky. Its face is difficult to discern—shifting constantly, like a reflection on rippling water.

I step up onto the platform. The figure turns to me, about to speak. With immeasurable gentleness, it presses its palm to my chest, directly above my heart. A subtle warmth pools there, spreading through my entire being. A strange hush falls, and for a moment, I yearn to let go of all fear and simply float in this soothing emptiness. The figure’s face momentarily comes into focus—eyes of liquid gold, brimming with compassion. Then it whispers without sound: “Do not run from your fate. Embrace every remaining moment.”

A hush follows, broken only by the echo of my own breathing.

The platform disintegrates beneath me, yet somehow I remain floating. The vines peel away as if they have grown restless, slithering out of place and revealing a boundless sky. Constellations swirl overhead, shimmering with unearthly brightness. In them, I see a collage of everything left undone: fleeting images of missed opportunities, phone calls never made, words unspoken. My breath falters as I realize all the regrets living in my chest. But before guilt can paralyze me, I sense another wave of warmth radiating from the center of that white cloak. It flows into me like a quiet tide, calming my regrets and illuminating the path I must travel in my final months.

Suddenly, I am standing in a wide, open field. The grass is knee-high, dancing in the wind. The sky—crimson at the horizon, indigo overhead—looks like living watercolor. At the center of this vast meadow, I see a tree more colossal than any I’ve encountered, its trunk thick and gnarled, filled with the scars of a thousand years. Its leaves shimmer with an impossible mosaic of opal and emerald. Beneath its branches, I sense every choice I’ve ever made, from the mundane to the monumental, woven as roots into the psyche of the soil. It feels as though the essence of my life can be cradled between its roots, and even the uncertain future is breathing in its highest limbs.

A gentle breeze tugs at me, almost playful, beckoning me to climb. I place a hand on the trunk. The bark is warm and pulsing like a heartbeat. The impossible swirl of color overhead reminds me of the fleeting nature of my existence. And in that moment, I am overtaken by a single impulse: to savor every glimmer of love left to me. Small or large, each moment can be precious if I allow myself to inhabit it fully.

Nothing can change the diagnosis—my time is finite. Yet, in this strange dream, everything is so vivid, so alive, that I feel compelled to celebrate what remains. I pull myself up onto the lowest branch of the tree. Its trunk rumbles gently, like distant thunder. With each branch I grasp, a memory blossoms—an image of dear ones, each representing a hope, a wish, a possibility I might still pursue.

Climbing higher, I notice the horizon bursting into a crescendo of color—glorious oranges and purples merging as if the sky itself has decided to honor my journey. So I continue upward, heart fluttering in my chest, determined now, resolved. Shimmering leaves whisper around me, urging me to keep going until at last I reach a vantage point that reveals the dreamscape’s entirety: rolling hills, distant oceans, swirling night skies, all converging in this magical plane of existence.

And there, perched at the top of the tree, I gaze out at the infinite tapestry of dreams, known and unknown. I envision myself returning to my life—my waking life—with this fierce new understanding. My final months will no longer be consumed by fear or mourning alone, but by a reverent, courageous resolve. Every sunrise or act of kindness or breath of fresh air becomes priceless treasure.

In the hush of the dream, as the colossal tree holds me in its final branches, I close my eyes. The wind, gentle and certain, lifts me in a warm embrace. And I emerge from the dream’s tender grace with a single promise to myself: to awaken and cherish the blessings of each fleeting day, every fleeting hour, until the very end.
