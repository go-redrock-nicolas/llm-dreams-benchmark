I am dreaming. …stagger backward into a landscape that seems to have been stitched together by feelings rather than physics. The room where the hurt took place unzips like fabric, and suddenly you are standing on a wide marble terrace hovering in twilight, halfway between sky and sea. Above you, enormous clouds drift by with glistening seams of gold—each one carrying the faint outline of the person you wounded. They glance down at you with eyes full of shimmering sorrow, and every flash of disappointment echoes like distant thunder inside your ribs.

You try to call out an apology, but your voice turns into a flock of white origami cranes. They flutter upward, spinning through columns of sapphire wind, but never quite reach the figure in the clouds. Breathless, you look around for something—anything—to mend the rift.

A door appears in the middle of the terrace: it’s carved from dark wood, its grain swirling in patterns that resemble fingerprints. When you push it open, warm lamplight spills through, and you step into a corridor lined with mirrors. In each reflection, you see yourself at different moments of carelessness—every time you interrupted, misunderstood, or looked away. With every step, the corridor narrows, the mirrors crowd closer, and the reflections whisper what-ifs in voices too soft to catch.

You break into a run until the corridor dilates into a great hall of towering hourglasses. Sand tumbles upward in some, downward in others—time in reverse, time accelerating, time stalled. In the center sits a single hourglass frozen in balance; its sand is neither falling nor rising, but suspended, glittering like starlight. You realize that this is the precise instant of the hurt—the moment you wish you could grasp in both hands and reshape.

Tentatively, you reach toward the glass. The moment your fingertips touch it, the floor beneath you melts into moonlit water, and you plunge through. You do not sink but drift, weightless, among colossal lilies whose petals pulse with light. Each lily pad bears a memory: laughter on a summer porch, hands intertwined during winter walks, late-night confessions over lukewarm coffee. The petals quiver, sensing your remorse.

A silver fish glides up to you, its scales inscribed with words you never said. It speaks without sound: Forgiveness begins where blame ends. It invites you to follow, and as you do, the water thickens into air, then into fragrant night fog. You step out onto a bridge woven of violin strings. Every footfall draws a rich, aching chord that fills the darkness with music—your regret, turned to melody.

Across the bridge waits the person you hurt, aglow with pale light. Their eyes still carry pain, but now also a question: Will you own this? Your apology still feels fragile and paper-thin, yet you offer it anyway. The violin-bridge picks up the tremor in your voice and steadies it, letting every note of sincerity ring clear. The other’s expression softens. They reach out and lay a hand over your chest; where they touch, an ember ignites, warm and humming—anew beginning.

The surrounding fog dissolves into constellations, and the sky folds open like a book, revealing blank pages asking to be written. There is still work to be done, conversations to have, trust to rebuild—but here, in this dream-forged dawn, possibility outweighs despair. Stars drift down, embedding themselves in the bridge until it gleams like a path of light leading forward. Hand in hand, you step onto it, ready to write tomorrow together.
