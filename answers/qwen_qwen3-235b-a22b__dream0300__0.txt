I am dreaming. And in the dream, the sky is the color of embers at dusk—burnt orange bleeding into bruised violet—like the heavens themselves are caught mid-scream, held in the tension of exhaling fire and inhaling thunder.

I stand at the top of a cliff that doesn’t exist in any map or memory—an impossible formation of obsidian glass and iridescent stone pockmarked with fossilized eyes blinking slowly in the moonlight. Below, a sea thrashes itself into foam and fury against the basalt pillars jutting from the waves like the spines of forgotten gods. There's no way down—only across a rope bridge woven from silver light and spider silk, swaying violently in a wind that sings with broken voices.

My hands are slick with something metallic and sweet-smelling—blood or nectar, maybe both—as I reach for the first trembling rope. And suddenly, my heart knows the activity that pulls me like a whisper from the void: I am going to cross this bridge, suspended over eternity itself.

And something is chasing me. 

I never see what it is, but I can feel it breathing on the back of my neck—an essence made of static and stolen shadows, a mass that is both featureless and filled with too many faces. My stomach drops like a stone into my pelvis. The fear there isn't cold; it's fire—alive, devouring, alive with unbearable possibility.

My feet stumble forward of their own accord. The bridge sways, tilts me sideways, and my vision fills with the dervish spiral of stars above and fanged waves below. My breath comes fast and shallow now, filled with the scent of ozone and the distant, intoxicating sweetness of my own fear liquefied in my mouth. Adrenaline pours through me like liquid lightning—not just fear, not just excitement, but *aliveness*, the raw and electric truth of being human on the edge of obliteration.

Each step demands something I didn't know I had—a foolish bravery, a bone-deep need to know how it feels to dance on the line between here and gone, now and not. The rope bites my palms like confession. I look down once and regret it instantly.

The sea isn’t water anymore. It’s a mirror of my future—shards of me scattered across its liquid surface. I am old on that sea. I am screaming. I am laughing, turning into birds, turning into trees, turning into nothing.

But the chase keeps me climbing. The shape behind me shrieks—not a word, not a sound, but a feeling I can barely hold in skin: *“Jump. Fall. Remember. Be still.”*

I run now. My feet barely touch the bridge as I soar across it like wire-walker born from starlight and defiance. Something uncanny courses through my limbs. Lightning crackles along each step. My body is a vessel, my heartbeat a drum, and every breath is a new candle lit in the cathedral of my chest.

And then—I make it. Not because I was brave. Not because I was worthy. But because I *went through*. The cliff on the other side is silent. The shape has evaporated into mist. The world is still. I fall to my knees upon the moss-covered groundand I laugh—not with joy, not with relief—but with the wild, unraveling edge of *having survived*.

And beyond me stretches a forest of trees that hum ancient songs through their bark and glow with spirit fire—a forest I am already stepping into. The danger is over, but the dream continues… deep into something stranger, something tender in its terror.

And I go. Always forward. Always dreaming.
