I am dreaming. The air is thick with an otherworldly mist, my feet sinking into a cobblestone path that winds through a labyrinth of towering, gothic buildings.  A chill wind carries the faint scent of burnt cinnamon and something metallic.  My heartbeat quickens as I realize the buildings aren't quite right - their windows have no glass, just swirling galaxies suspended within. 

 Suddenly, I see you.  Well, not you exactly.  It's the shadow of you, cloaked in a black duster that billows like smoke.  You're talking to a group of spectral figures that materialize from the mist.  Their faces are made of shifting constellations, their voices resonate like distant thunder.  They're offering you something - a glowing orb that pulses like a heartbeat.  Your shadow-self accepts it, and as you take it, your eyes glint gold, and the world shifts around us.

Your hands start levitating objects - books float in midair, pencils skate across the cobblestones, and a pocket watch spins like a helicopter blade.  But something's wrong.  The objects you move aren't following the laws of physics.  The books snap and warp like old film, the pencils splinter and catch fire midair, and the pocket watch's hands spin backward, somehow spelling out "Beware the 13th."  The spectral figures laugh, their eyes blazing like supernovas. 

I want to wake up, but I can't.  Your laughter echoes in the mist - it's not your usual chuckle.  It's lower, darker, like the growl of a subway tunnel.  You turn to me, and your shadow-self morphs into something more terrifying - the outline of a raven's wings spread behind you.  "You know what they say about change," you say, your voice a mix of gravel and static.  "Even the sun can't remember its name."

The world starts crumbling.  The buildings dissolve into stardust, the cobblestones sink into an abyss, and the spectral figures melt into liquid mercury.  I try to grab your arm, but my hand passes through you like smoke.  "Wait," I shout, but the mist swallows my voice.  The dream ends with your shadow-self stepping into a black door that appears out of nowhere.  The door slams shut, and the sound is like a gunshot.  Then, I wake up, my sheets soaked in sweat, and my heart pounding against my ribcage.

The dream was so vivid that I'm still tingling where your face used to be. I can't shake the feeling that this wasn't just a dream - that it's a warning.  But what should I do? Do I confront you?  Do I ignore it?  Do I even believe it?  The phone rings as I'm thinking, and it's you on the other end.  "Hey, did you have that weird dream too?" you ask, your voice normal.  "I did. But it was different. I was the one giving you the orb.  Anyway, want to grab coffee?" 

I don't know what to say.  My fingers are still numb from grasping at air, and the taste of burnt cinnamon fills my mouth.  I agree to coffee, but as we walk, I notice that every time you laugh, the streetlights flicker.  And when you mention the 13th, a taxi speeds past, its horn blaring like the spectral laughter.  I'm not scared - I'm intrigued.  Maybe this is the start of something, or the middle, or the end of a story that's been unfolding in my subconscious for years.  But right now, I just want to know - what was in that orb?  And why do I feel like I'm the one who's been changed?
It begins in the blackest depths of twilight, a liminal space where reality fractures like cracked porcelain. You're standing knee-deep in a river that flows upward, its waves crystalline and suffused with the glow of bioluminescent algae. The water isn't wet, nor is it cold - it's a dense, syrupy medium that clings to your skin like second-skin velvet. Above you, the sky is a fractured mosaic of constellations, each one shifting colors like a chameleon in the rain. A crow with iridescent feathers perches on your shoulder, its beak tracing symbols in the air that make your spine tingle. Suddenly, you realize the river is reflecting not the night sky, but a montage of memories - your first kiss, a childhood birthday, a moment you've long buried. Each reflection distorts, warping into grotesque parodies of the original. 

The caw of the crow echoes like a guardian's warning, and you turn to see your friend approaching, but it's not your friend. It's a doppelgänger with your friend's face contorted into a rictus grin, its eyes glowing like embers from a forest fire. It holds out a key made of twisted silver vines, the teeth of the key pointing backward. "You know what's buried," it whispers, its voice a chorus of overlapping echoes. "You know where the truth sleeps." The cawing intensifies, the crows now descending en masse, their wings beating in synchronized rhythms that sound like Morse code. 

As you reach for the key, the river surges upward, pulling you into its depths. The water isn't water anymore - it's liquid time, swirling around you in a kaleidoscope of moments both lived and yet to come. You see your friend standing in a field of poppies, their red petals bleeding into the ground, forming a pool that mirrors the sky. They're reaching out to you, their hand a skeletal outline, and you realize with a jolt that their veins are filled with golden liquid that glows like liquid sunbeams. 

But you can't touch them. Because you're sinking, and the river is pulling you into a vortex that spirals into a black hole. The edges of your vision blur, colors bleeding into each other until everything is a blur of indigo and crimson. Then, you wake up, your sheets tangled like vines, and your hands clutching at the air where the key was. Your friend is on the other side of the room, yawning, their hair tousled as if they've just woken up. 

"You okay?" they ask, blinking sleepily. You nod, too shaken to speak, watching as their hand brushes against the wall, and for a split second, the wall dissolves into a cascade of falling stars. 

Minutes later, you're in a café, your hands still trembling. Your friend orders a drink that doesn't exist - a "Midnight Horizon" with a swirl of edible glitter. They sip it and pretend not to notice that the steam from the cup forms shapes like the constellations from your dream. You mention the dream in a careless tone, feeling their gaze linger on you. "Funny," they say. "I dreamed about a garden where flowers sang in different languages, and a gate that only opened when you whispered backwards." 

The air between you thickens, charged with the unspoken. Outside, a streetlight flickers in time with your heartbeat, and you see a shadow pass by the window - a crow with iridescent wings. Your friend laughs, but it sounds hollow, and you catch a glimpse of their reflection in the spoon, distorted into something unrecognizable. 

As you leave, the wind whips through the streets, carrying the scent of burnt cinnamon, and you realize that you're walking differently - your steps lighter, your head held higher. The world has shifted, if only slightly, and you're not sure if it's a warning, a promise, or the beginning of a story you'll one day tell by the light of a dying star.
