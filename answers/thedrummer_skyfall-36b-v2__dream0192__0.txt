I am dreaming. The scene unfolds before you, vivid and surreal, like a surrealist painting come to life. You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, barren plain, stretching endlessly in all directions. The ground beneath your feet is a strange, shimmering obsidian, reflecting an eerie silver glow from the full moon above.

As you gaze out over the desolate landscape, a figure emerges from the distance, slowly walking towards you. As it comes closer, you recognize it as a distorted version of yourself, but not quite. This shadowy doppelg√§nger has your face, but its eyes are glowing orbs of swirling chaos, its skin a patchwork quilt of memories and experiences from your past.

"It's time to wake up," the apparition says, its voice an unsettling amalgamation of every person you've ever known. "To see the truth."

Suddenly, crumbling beneath you the plane shatters into a thousand shimmering shards, each one displaying a different moment from your life. Memories you had long forgotten come rushing back - a childhood trauma, a long-buried guilt, a hidden fear. They form a whirlwind around you, the central axis of your identity.

At the vortex's heart, an ancient tome appears, its cover glowing with the light of forbidden knowledge. It pulses in your mind with "Open me." You hesitate, your deeply-held beliefs wavering as you reach out towards the book.

As your fingers brush the weathered leather, visions of the world shudder and reshape before you. The impossible, the radical, the shocking: each page unleashes contradicting evidence of your long-held views. They swirl around you, solidifying into tangible, unmistakable truth.

Your knees buckle, overwhelmed by the cognitive dissonance. Trust crumbles, foundations fissure beneath your feet. Gasping, you try to hold on, but it's futile. The tome's revelations are undeniable, an ocean of doubt drowning your once unshakable convictions.

In this dream, you stand at the precipice of identity crisis, shattered, raw, filled with questions. Who are you, if not this viewpoint that has shaped you for so long? What else will crumble, when everything you know is shattered?

The air crackles with possibility as you hold the tome, the book of unravelling. Even in this dream, you sense there is Ebongo Crossing, and among its many secrets, only one is constant: that your identity, like the dream world itself, is adolescence.
