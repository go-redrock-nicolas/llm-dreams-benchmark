I am dreaming. …imagine wonder itself.

At the instant the thought blossoms, the hallway behind you unspools into shimmering threads, dissolving like gossamer caught in sunrise. Ahead, the new world blooms. You inhale—and with that single breath the air thickens into lilac-scented mist, swirling around your ankles and coiling up your spine like an excited ribbon. A delighted thrill sparks through your body: here, the universe is clay and your imagination, the sculptor’s hands.

Your first desire is light—pure, playful, dancing light—so you conjure a sky formed from liquid stained glass. Iridescent panes drift overhead, continually rearranging into mosaics that glow from within. Each pane hums a note, and together they weave a celestial chord that thrums in your bones. The ground responds in harmony: blades of grass transform into tiny crystal prisms that catch the sky-music, refracting it into color. Every footstep you take sets off a micro-firework of sound and rainbow, as though the earth is laughing beneath you.

You decide to wander and summon a path, and it appears: a ribbon-bridge of moonstone that curls up into the air, abandoning gravity on a whim. It arches through lazily drifting islands—floating pockets of forest, desert, and ocean that orbit one another like slow, thoughtful planets. On your left, an oasis-island splashes with turquoise water that cascades over its edges, only to vanish in mid-fall, evaporating into silver motes that reappear as gentle rain on your right. Everything here loops in playful contradiction.

You remember childhood sketches of dragons shaped like autumn leaves, so you pluck that memory from your mind. In seconds, a rust-red dragon unfurls from a maple leaf spinning down past your face. Its wings crackle like dry foliage; its eyes glow citrine; its breath is warm cinnamon wind. It swoops low, inviting you to ride. You climb onto the dragon’s back, gripping veins that run through its leaf-skin like rivers of amber light. With a leap, it carries you off the ribbon-bridge and through clouds of scented steam—peppermint, then jasmine, then the nostalgic smell of rain on summer asphalt.

Below, you envision a library where stories are alive, and immediately it appears: a spiral tower spun from parchment, each step an unfurling page. The dragon glides to its balcony and you dismount. Inside, books flutter like moths; every time you open one, it releases the scene it holds. You crack a spine titled “Echoes of Laughter,” and a shower of giggles—your siblings’, long forgotten—fills the space, ricocheting off the walls like bouncing rubber balls. You pocket a single giggle for later, tucking it behind your ear where it vibrates mischievously.

Curiosity tugs you onward. You picture a sea made of midnight velvet studded with fireflies instead of stars, and instantly you are there, barefoot at its shore. The water is cool fabric against your legs. Each step churns constellations that drift up to orbit your shoulders. You whisper a wish for guidance and the stars re-stitch themselves into an arrow, pointing toward the horizon. A boat made of translucent quartz surfaces with a sigh, ready.

You board, setting sail across the velvet waves, while the leaf-dragon circles above like a guardian kite, trailing autumn in its wake. Somewhere in the distance, a colossal clocktower built of floating sands counts time forward and backward at once, chimes echoing both arrival and departure. You realize time here is nothing but an optional accessory, worn only if you fancy.

Standing on the bow, breeze of possibility on your face, you understand: in this dream world, imagination is not merely creative—it is sovereign. Whatever you dare to picture will bloom, sing, and soar.

So you close your eyes, draw in a breath scented like first snow and last summer, and decide—again, and again, and again—to imagine.
