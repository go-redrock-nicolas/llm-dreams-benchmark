I am dreaming.  I am not happy.

You begin creating new symbols and rules that challenge the very foundation of mathematics.  You feel exhilarated but also anxious.  You wonder if your work will be accepted or ridiculed by the math community. 

Suddenly, you receive a message from a mysterious source who claims to have solved the same proof before, using an approach that is even more radical than yours.  You feel intrigued and curious but also skeptical and cautious.  Who is this person? How do they know your work? What are their real intentions? 

You decide to meet the mysterious source face-to-face, in a dream realm where reality and imagination intersect.  You feel excited and brave but also worried and scared.  Can you trust this person? What if they are not who they claim to be? What if they harm you or steal your work? 

As you enter the dream realm, you see a shadowy figure standing before you. You approach them cautiously and ask them their identity. They reveal themselves as an ancient mathematician who has been waiting for someone like you to come along.  You feel surprised and impressed but also confused and skeptical.  How is this person alive? Why have they been waiting? What do they want from you? 

The ancient mathematician explains that they invented the radical new approach to mathematics that you and they are both seeking. They claim that it was too powerful for their time, so they hid it away until someone could appreciate its true value.  You feel amazed and grateful but also curious and suspicious.  Why did they hide it? What is the approach? What do they mean by "true value"? 

The ancient mathematician reveals a stone tablet with symbols etched into it. They say that these are the secrets of their approach, but only those pure of heart can understand them.  You feel intrigued and eager but also anxious and doubtful.  Are you pure of heart? Can you really understand this? Do you want to? 

You touch the stone tablet, and suddenly, you are engulfed in a bright light that fills your senses. You feel euphoric and enlightened but also confused and frightened.  You see visions of complex mathematical structures and patterns that defy explanation. You hear whispers of ancient languages and forgotten cultures that echo in your mind. You taste flavors of exotic spices and rare herbs that dance on your tongue. 

You realize that the stone tablet contains a language that transcends words and numbers. It communicates through geometry, music, and emotion. It connects with your soul and unlocks your potential.  You understand the approach of the ancient mathematician, but you also create your own version of it. 

You wake up from the dream feeling invigorated and inspired. You feel like you have discovered a new side of yourself and your passion for mathematics. You wonder if this is what the mysterious source meant by "true value".
