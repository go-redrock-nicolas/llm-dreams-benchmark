I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast library that stretches beyond comprehension, its ceiling vanishing into swirling cosmic mist. Books with living covers breathe gently on endless shelves that curve and bend in impossible geometries. The knowledge contained here pulses with tangible energy—I can feel it brushing against my consciousness like curious fingers.

Suddenly, I'm aware that I must navigate this labyrinth to find a single, crucial tome. The air thickens with urgency as whispers reach me: civilizations rise and fall with each passing moment, dependent on my choice. Paths multiply before me, branching into fractals of possibility.

I begin moving, each footstep causing ripples across the floor that shimmer with memories—some mine, some belonging to entities I've never encountered. Contradictory information floods my senses: left leads to salvation but also destruction; right offers clarity but possible deception.

The library trembles. Decisions crystallize into physical crossroads around me. A clock with thirteen faces counts down in languages I somehow understand despite never learning them. My fingertips tingle with the weight of responsibility as I reach toward a glowing volume that simultaneously attracts and repels me.

The cognitive burden intensifies—each thought branches into a thousand consequences, each consequence into a million repercussions. I'm processing patterns across dimensions, seeing connections between seemingly disparate concepts while time compresses and expands erratically.

Just as the overwhelming cascade of information threatens to fracture my consciousness, everything pauses. A single dewdrop of perfect clarity forms in the center of my awareness, reflecting all possibilities at once. In this suspended moment, I understand—the choice itself is the answer, the journey the destination.

I reach forward, my decision made.

And then I wake.
