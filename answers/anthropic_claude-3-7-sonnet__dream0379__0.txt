I am dreaming. I find myself walking through an ancient library that seems to expand infinitely in all directions. The ceiling arches so high it disappears into shadows, while bookshelves tower like redwoods around me. My fingers trail along leather-bound spines as I move deeper into the labyrinth of knowledge.

Suddenly, I realize I'm clutching a manuscript—my manuscript—and I'm desperately searching for someone to approve it. This strikes me as odd; I've always trusted my own judgment before. Each person I encounter wears a face that shifts between stranger and friend, and I find myself modifying my words based on their expressions, watching their reactions with mounting anxiety.

The floor beneath me transforms to glass, revealing my reflection—but it's fractured into multiple versions of myself. One stands tall and certain, while another hunches, eyes darting for approval. Between them flows a river of memories: moments when I made bold choices without hesitation, followed by recent instances where I've hesitated, second-guessed, sought validation.

The library begins to fold in on itself, books flying open, pages becoming birds that circle overhead. One particularly bright bird descends, transforming into a key that lands in my palm. It's warm, almost alive.

A door materializes before me—ordinary, wooden, slightly weathered. I instinctively know it leads back to my core self. As I insert the key, whispers surround me: "What will they think?" "Is this right?" "Should you ask first?"

I pause, hand trembling slightly, before a profound clarity washes over me. These voices aren't mine. They've accumulated like dust, obscuring what I've always known. With renewed determination, I turn the key.

Beyond the door lies a garden bathed in golden light where every plant grows according to its own nature—no external validation required. I feel my breath deepen as I recognize this place as my authentic self, waiting patiently for my return.

I awaken with the lingering sensation that something fundamental has been restored.
