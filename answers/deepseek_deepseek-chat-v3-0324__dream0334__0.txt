I am dreaming. At first, there is only weightlessness, as if floating in a vast, starless abyss—no up, no down, just an endless, silent expanse. Then, faint at first, a pulse thrums through the air, though there is no air—only the sensation of rhythm, deep and resonant, like the heartbeat of the world itself. My own body is not my own, yet I can feel every nerve alight, every pore alive with an electric buzz.  

Without warning, the void splits open—not with light, but with color, colors that have no name, hues that shift and bleed into forms that twist like liquid silk. Towers of iridescent stone rise from nothing, spiraling up into impossible geometries, fractaling outward in ways that defy logic. The ground beneath me (was there always ground?) is glass-thin yet bottomless, reflecting scenes from other dreams, flickering like distant memories.  

A sound—like a choir of voices made of wind and sunlight—whispers just beyond comprehension. Words half-formed, melodies that dissolve when I grasp for them. My chest tightens, though I have no need for breath. My skin prickles with the sense of something vast and ancient watching me from beyond the shifting walls of this place.  

Then—movement. Shadows that aren’t shadows flit at the edges, creatures woven from smoke and moonlight, their eyes like shattered mirrors reflecting countless lives. They don’t approach, but I can *feel* their curiosity, their hunger for something just out of reach. A sweet, aching scent drifts through the air—like burnt sugar and midnight rain—and suddenly I remember... something. A face? A name? Gone before it fully forms.  

The dream surges, twists. Now I am running—no, flying—no, dissolving—through landscapes that melt like wax. Deserts of black sand under twin violet suns. Cities of living crystal humming with forgotten songs. A bridge woven from spider silk, stretching into a storm of dying stars. Every step sends ripples through reality itself, and I realize—this place isn’t just *around* me. It is *inside* me. And I am inside it.  

And then—the pull. A gravity that is not gravity drags me toward a door that wasn’t there a moment ago. It’s carved from bone and starlight, covered in symbols that shift like restless insects. My fingers (do I still have fingers?) brush the surface—  

—And I wake.  

Panting. Heart hammering. Skin still humming with the echoes of something too vast to name. The dream is gone.  

But I know—somewhere, in the hidden folds of the world, it still breathes.  

Waiting.
