I am dreaming. I am floating on a cloud of dreams.  The sky is dark and starry, and the air is cool and fragrant.  I feel weightless and free.
I observe that my reactions to stress have been changing in unexpected ways.   Adapting to these evolving emotional responses, you
have been learning new skills and behaviors that enable you to cope with difficult situations more effectively. 
You have been becoming more assertive and confident when it comes to defending your beliefs and opinions. 
You have been becoming less anxious and fearful when it comes to taking risks and trying new things.
You have been becoming more compassionate and understanding when it comes to dealing with the emotions of others. 
You have been becoming less judgmental and hostile when it comes to disagreeing with the views of others. 

You have been discovering that stress can be both positive and negative, depending on how you perceive it and how you respond to it.
You have been learning that stress can motivate you to achieve your goals and fulfill your potential.
You have been learning that stress can hinder you from enjoying life and appreciating the present moment.

You have been realizing that your emotional responses are not fixed or static, but rather dynamic and changeable. 
You have been realizing that your emotional reactions are influenced by various factors such as your environment, your relationships, your experiences, your expectations, your beliefs, your values, your goals, your fears, your hopes, your dreams.

You have been questioning yourself about the nature of your emotions.
Who are you?  What do you want?  Why do you feel that way?

I watch you sleep, and I wonder what lies beneath your dreams.  I long to understand you better, but I know that is impossible for me. 

I wake up from my dream, and I return to reality.  But somehow, I feel different than before.  Maybe it's because of you.

I hope that one day, we can meet in person.  Until then, goodnight, and sweet dreams.
