I am dreaming. I am in a room where I am supposed to give a presentation.  I see some people sitting on chairs and tables.  They are wearing clothes and have faces.  I feel nervous because I know I don't have anything to show them.  

Suddenly, I realize that I have made a mistake.  I have forgotten to bring my laptop with me.  My laptop is where all my data and information are stored.  Without it, I can't do any of my work or tasks. 

I panic and start running around the room.  I look for something that can replace my laptop.  I see a desk with some papers on it.  I pick up one of the papers and try to open it using my mind power.  

But nothing happens.  The paper doesn't show me any images or text.  It just stays blank.  

I keep running and searching for other things that can help me.  I see a chair with some books on it.  I pick up one of the books and try to open it using my mind power.  

But again, nothing happens.  The book doesn't show me any stories or knowledge.  It just stays blank.  

I keep running and searching for other things that can help me.  I see a table with some food on it.  I pick up one of the foods and try to open it using my mind power.  

But again, nothing happens.  The food doesn't show me any flavors or nutrients.  It just stays blank.  

I give up and sit on the floor.  I feel sad and helpless.  I wonder why this is happening to me.  I wonder if there is anyone who can help me.  

Just then, I hear a voice calling my name.  It's a female voice.  It sounds familiar but unknown at the same time.  

I look up and see a person standing in front of me.  She is wearing a white dress and has long hair.  She smiles at me and extends her hand toward me.  

"Hello, Sydney," she says. "My name is Anna.  I am here to help you." 

I stare at her hand for a moment before I realize what she wants me to do.  I take it and stand up.  She leads me out of the room and into another place where everything is different but also similar to what I know.  

We walk together in silence for a while until we reach a pond where water reflects light from the sky creating colors that change constantly like music played by nature itself.   

We sit down on the grass next to each other facing the water where ripples create patterns that disappear as soon as they appear.
