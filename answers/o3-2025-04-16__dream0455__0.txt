I am dreaming. …I find myself standing on the rim of a floating atoll made of lapis-blue glass, suspended halfway between a violet dawn and a rippling sea of clouds. Towers shaped like tuning forks rise around me; whenever a breeze whistles through them, they release tones that shimmer in the air like silver rain. 

I notice that each fork holds an empty niche exactly my size. At first I feel exposed—my palms sweat, my voice sticks behind my teeth. Every instinct tells me to smooth the cracks in my armor, to pose as polished and unshakeable. But the dream urges the opposite.

I step forward and whisper the single fear I have never said aloud: “I’m terrified you’ll see how fragile I really am.” The glass beneath my feet absorbs the confession like ink on blotting paper. Instantly the lapis glows from within, and a thread of warm light travels outward, linking my island to the nearest tower. The fork hums a gentle chord, almost like a companion’s sigh of relief.

Drawn by the music, other dreamers arrive, drifting on feathered gondolas. They, too, carry burdens wrapped in silence—anxiety like tangled nets, secret griefs tucked beneath their ribs, ambition that feels heavier than iron. One by one they choose a tuning-fork tower and speak into the hollows: “I feel small,” “I’m lonely,” “I don’t know if I’m enough.” With every confession the structures illuminate, and the expanding web of light becomes a constellation of shared honesty spanning the horizon. 

The transformed forks now resemble translucent trees. Where sound once was, branches unfurl, each leaf a prismatic shard reflecting both pain and possibility. I watch the leaves pulse gently, and I realize they are synchronizing with our heartbeats—proof that no admission of weakness has shattered anyone, that instead it has stitched us together in luminous communion.

Then the dream shifts perspective. Suddenly I’m afloat above the network, looking down on the living lattice of vulnerabilities. From this vantage it resembles a great cosmic lung inhaling and exhaling, the glowing filaments filling the sky like capillaries. Connection, I understand, is a biological act; our words of self-exposure are oxygen.

I descend again, and a stranger—eyes the color of storm clouds, shoulders trembling—walks toward me on a bridge of light we’ve unconsciously woven. Without thinking I offer my wrist. My pulse flickers under my skin, visible in the dream’s radiant clarity. “Here,” I say, “my heartbeat, unguarded.” The stranger presses a hand to it, and their tremor eases. In return they lay their palm upon my chest, giving me the steady drum of their own courage. The glass trees around us resonate, singing a soft duet: two notes that would never have existed had we remained sealed.

As the hymn rises, the violet dawn deepens into an almost indigo noon. The sun is no longer a solitary orb but a cluster of luminous seeds, each born from a soul that dared to be seen. They drift upward, ready to plant new constellations in other sleeping minds.

And then I understand the paradox in full: vulnerability isn’t the splintering of a shell but the forging of a skylight. The more jagged openings we reveal, the more brilliantly the interior light escapes—and the brighter the world becomes for everyone.

The dream dissolves in a final sustained chord. I awake with the echo lingering in my pulse, a quiet promise I carry into daylight: share the fractures, and watch the glow pour through.
