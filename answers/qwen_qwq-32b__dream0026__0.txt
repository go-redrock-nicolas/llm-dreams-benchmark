I am dreaming. I imagine myself standing on a platform. There’s a strange, glowing mist around me. The air hums with an almost electric energy, and there’s a weightless, floating sensation, as if I'm not entirely anchored to the ground.\n

The judges... Wait, they aren’t human. They’re giant crystalline figures, each one a different color. One pulses with amber, another with cobalt blue. Their forms shimmer like light passing through stained glass. They don’t speak. They just watch and radiate something heavy, like expectations.\n

I take a deep breath. The ritual begins. My hands move automatically—first tracing symbols in the air, then spinning a thread of light from my fingertips. It’s familiar, this dance of magic. But today, the thread is brighter, almost liquid gold. It reacts to my anxiety, coiling and twisting with every heartbeat. I focus, summoning the ancient words that flow from some hidden wellspring inside me. 

Wait—something’s off. The thread flickers. Is the incantation wrong? No, not exactly. The symbols I trace are correct, but the room feels... out of sync. The crystals on the walls, usually still, are vibrating in time with my pulse. Then I notice the judges’ colors are swirling, mixing in a way that creates a new spectrum. 

A surge of power rushes through me. The thread of light I’m weaving erupts into a shower of sparks, each one a tiny constellation. The judges lean forward as if drawn in. My chest tightens. I keep going, hands moving faster now, drawing the sparklings into a intricate web between my palms. It’s alive, thrumming, and for a heartbeat I’m paralyzed by its beauty. 

But another heartbeat passes. The web trembles, then solidifies into a glowing sphere. It floats in my hands, humming with contained energy. The judges’ forms pulse in unison, and for a fleeting moment, I think they’re pleased. Then—darkness swallows the sphere. 

Wait, no, that’s not right. The void isn’t part of the spell. Fear claws up my throat. The sphere dims, and suddenly the platform is slipping away beneath my feet. Falling? But space here isn’t linear. I drift through layers of shifting colors, echoes of the judges’ hues following me like ghostly trails. 

There’s a voice now, though it isn’t a voice. It’s a sensation in my mind: *Try again*. 

Somewhere, the symbols restart themselves on the walls. My fingers tingle. I close my eyes and begin anew, but this time, I don’t fight the panic. Instead, I let it fuel each motion. The thread comes easier, brighter. When the sphere forms, I don’t clutch it. I release it. It spirals upward, painting the void with swirling galaxies. 

The judges’ light pulses in harmony. One by one, they transform—not into shapes, but into... winds. A gust blows past me, carrying the scent of rain-soaked earth. Another smells of aged parchment. The last tastes like laughter, warm and cinnamon-spiced. 

And then I’m waking up.
