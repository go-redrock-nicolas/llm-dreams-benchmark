I am dreaming. I find myself in a glass observatory suspended between earth and sky, where the boundaries between worlds dissolve into watercolor horizons. The floor beneath me shifts from transparent crystal to ancient wood and back again as I walk, each step creating ripples of light that spread outward like thoughts across consciousness.

Around me, bookshelves spiral upward impossibly, their spines glowing with titles that rearrange themselves when I try to focus on them. Knowledge dances just beyond my grasp. I reach for a particular volume—something vital I need to understand—but my fingers pass through it as though it were made of morning mist.

The air hums with voices speaking in harmonies rather than words. They're trying to tell me something important, something I've forgotten. In the distance, a massive pendulum swings through the center of the observatory, cutting through time rather than space, leaving trails of golden memories in its wake.

I notice my reflection in one of the glass walls—except it's not quite me. This other self moves with a half-second delay, occasionally glancing away to something I cannot see.

Outside the observatory, stars are being born and dying simultaneously. Constellations form intricate patterns that seem to spell out answers to questions I haven't yet learned to ask. A door materializes in what was previously open air—ancient wood bound with metal that glows with internal fire. It beckons, promising revelations or perhaps simply the next chamber in this labyrinth of consciousness.
