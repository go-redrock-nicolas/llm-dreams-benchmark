I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I find myself standing on the edge of a shimmering, otherworldly cliff, where the ground beneath my feet pulses with a faint, electric hum, as if the earth itself is alive with secrets. The sky above is a swirling kaleidoscope of violet and amber, streaked with veins of silver lightning that crackle silently in the distance. A heavy, metallic tang hangs in the air, mingling with the scent of ozone and something sweeter, like overripe fruit. I feel an unshakable certainty deep in my bones—a catastrophic event is coming, a calamity so immense it will shatter this surreal landscape and everyone in it. I glance at an ancient, rune-covered pocket watch that materializes in my trembling hand; its hands are spinning too fast, but I somehow know there is exactly one hour until the end.

My heart thunders as I turn and sprint toward a sprawling, crystalline city nestled in a valley below. The city is a marvel, its towering spires carved from translucent quartz that refract the chaotic light of the sky into a thousand rainbows. The streets are alive with beings unlike any I’ve ever seen—ethereal figures with elongated limbs and glowing, opalescent skin, their voices a melodic hum that vibrates through my chest. I weave through them, my breath ragged, shouting warnings of the impending doom. “A cataclysm is coming! We have only an hour!” I cry, my voice hoarse with desperation. But their luminous eyes merely flicker with mild curiosity before they turn away, their humming resuming as if my words were nothing more than a passing breeze.

I grab the arm of a towering figure draped in a robe of liquid light, pleading with them to listen. “Please, you must believe me! The world will fracture—fire will rain from the sky, and the ground will swallow us whole!” But they tilt their head, their face a smooth, featureless mask, and murmur in a voice like wind chimes, “Child of dreams, your fears are but shadows. We are eternal.” They glide past me, dismissive, leaving me trembling with frustration and dread.

As I stand in the center of a bustling plaza, surrounded by the indifferent crowd, I can feel the minutes slipping away like grains of sand through my fingers. My rune-covered watch now burns against my skin, its hands blurring as the countdown continues. Fifty minutes. Forty. I force myself to maintain composure, though my chest feels as if it might crack open from the weight of my unspoken terror. I take deep, shuddering breaths, the air tasting of ash now, a harbinger of what’s to come. I climb atop a pedestal where a massive, pulsating crystal hovers, amplifying my voice as I shout once more into the crowd. “Please, I beg you—seek shelter, prepare, do something!” A few pause, their glowing eyes narrowing faintly, but the majority continue their melodic hum, their movements graceful and unhurried, as if time itself is irrelevant to them.

Thirty minutes. The sky darkens, the violet and amber hues bleeding into a deep, ominous crimson. The silver lightning now strikes closer, illuminating jagged tears in the fabric of the heavens. A low, guttural rumble begins to emanate from the ground, a sound so visceral it rattles my teeth. I can see it now—faint fissures spiderwebbing through the crystalline streets, glowing with an eerie, molten light. My pulse races, but I clench my fists, refusing to let panic consume me. I must find someone, anyone, who will believe.

I spot a childlike figure near the edge of the plaza, smaller than the others, their opalescent skin flickering with uncertainty. Their wide, luminous eyes meet mine, and for the first time, I see a flicker of fear. I kneel before them, my voice softening but urgent. “You feel it too, don’t you? The wrongness in the air, the trembling beneath us. We have so little time—help me warn the others.” The child tilts their head, their hum quieter, more dissonant, but before they can respond, a deafening crack splits the air. One of the crystalline spires shatters, raining glittering shards down upon the crowd. Screams—finally, screams—pierce the melodic hum as chaos erupts.

Ten minutes. The ground heaves violently now, throwing me to my knees. The crimson sky splits open, revealing a void beyond comprehension, a swirling maelstrom of darkness punctuated by fiery, molten streaks that begin to plummet toward us. The ethereal beings scatter, their humming replaced by discordant wails, but it’s too late. I clasp the child’s hand, pulling them toward a nearby cavern carved into the cliffside, hoping against hope that we can survive the impact.

As we stumble into the darkness of the cave, the final seconds tick away in my mind, though my watch glows too brightly to read now. The world outside explodes into blinding light and deafening sound—an inferno of destruction, a deluge of destruction that shakes the very marrow of existence. Yet, in this fleeting shelter, I hold the child close, their flickering form pressed against mine, and whisper, “We’ll survive this. We have to.” Their hum, faint and broken, resonates with a glimmer of belief, and for the first time since this nightmare began, I feel a spark of hope amidst the ruin—a fragile, desperate hope that even in the face of oblivion, we might yet endure. And then, as the dream trembles on the edge of waking, the darkness swallows us whole.
