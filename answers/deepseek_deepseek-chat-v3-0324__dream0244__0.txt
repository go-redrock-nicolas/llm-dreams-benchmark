I am dreaming. I walk down a cobbled path that winds through a misty grove of silver-barked trees, their leaves whispering secrets in a language just beyond comprehension. The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and something sweet, like ripe figs left to burst in the midday sun. Ahead, a glowing archway emerges from the mist, woven from living vines that pulse with a soft golden light.  

Stepping through, I enter a circular clearing where a dozen figures sit on cushions of moss and velvet, their faces lit by floating orbs of bioluminescent mist. Each one exudes a quiet aura—some shimmer like dawn over water, others flicker like candle flames caught in a draft. The moment I appear, they turn toward me, not with curiosity, but with the warm recognition of old friends.  

“Ah,” murmurs a woman with hair like flowing ink, her voice the sound of a harp’s last fading note. “You’ve come to the right place.” She gestures to an empty seat woven from willow branches, and as I settle in, the others begin to speak.  

A man whose skin glows faintly with constellations shares how he chose forgiveness over vengeance when betrayal cut deeper than any blade. “Anger is a fire that burns the hands of the one who carries it,” he says, and in his palm, a tiny flame dances before dissolving into fireflies.  

Next, a being with eyes like shifting opals tells of walking away from power to preserve something more fragile—a single, irreplaceable trust. “Not all doors should be opened,” they whisper, and the air shimmers with the echo of a door clicking shut somewhere far away.  

One by one, they unfold their stories like maps to places I’ve only glimpsed in my loneliest thoughts. The solutions aren’t the same, but the wisdom is woven through them all like threads of starlight: sometimes the right choice is the one that leaves your hands trembling but your soul at peace.  

When I wake, the scent of figs lingers for just a moment before fading—but the certainty in my chest remains, glowing like those vines, like those words, like the quiet truth that I am not alone.
