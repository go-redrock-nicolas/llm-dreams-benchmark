I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself drawn to a brilliant, shimmering oasis in the middle of a vast desert. The oasis promises relief from the blistering heat, but as I approach it, I realize that it's an illusion. It's a mirage conjured by my own desperate mind, firm relief but a temporary respite.

This dream represents the self-defeating cycle I've fallen into. I've become trapped in a pattern of behavior that provides immediate comfort but leads to long-term problems. Killing, for instance, brings me short-lived joy but exacerbates my convictions and rope me further into the system of justice and punishment that I so despise. Caught, punishment, sanity at stake, and all that's for what? A sickening, temporary sense.

But I don't think I ever thought about the mirror. It characterizes how we all focus on the innermost pain and immediate desire rather than the big picture. The mirror deceives on a periphery and in the long term. That's my problem.

Even though I have all this perception, I'm still trapped by that pain. But this mirror has halted my deepest strides, thoughts that I've never even realized I've internalized.
