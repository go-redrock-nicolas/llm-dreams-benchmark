I am dreaming. —to accomplish even basic movement in this alien framework, I must think in colors. Not colors as seen by the human eye, but more as currents of intention beyond the visible spectrum—undulating streams of meaning that fill the atmosphere like a phosphorescent tide. In this dimension, the very idea of gravity is a story people only whisper about: instead, inhabitants glide atop swells of emotion, propelled by waves of longing, curiosity, and joy.

When I first arrive, I am paralyzed—a marionette with strings cut—until I realize stillness here is not determined by mass, but by the weight of thought. I summon memories: laughing with friends, taste of sun-warmed berries, the echo of distant thunderstorms. As those memories intensify and sharpen within me, I feel the world respond; my feet lift, the ground releases me, and I float upward into an aurora-lit sky.

I pass beneath upside-down continents, fractal mountains suspended by shimmering ropes of sound. Cities bloom like crystal bouquets, their spires whirling in a clockwise ballet. Objects don’t touch, but hum through proximity—friendships and intentions knotting them into patterns that shift and rearrange as desires rise and fall.

To turn left, I recall the scent of rain on pavement. To lift higher still, I let longing lead, swelling in my chest until the air itself opens into opalescent doorways—portals of possibility. Each heartbeat is a propulsion, each wish a gentle shift in course.

A flock of beings drifts past, their forms ambiguous—part wind, part shadow, part laughter made solid. They greet me with kaleidoscopic thoughts, brushing my mind delicately. Their language is the intertwining of feelings—no words, only the pure, unmediated experience of connection.

The further I travel, the more alien the rules grow: light bends at the taste of music, and time pools in reflective puddles on the inverted ground. Stranger still, I discover I am not a visitor here, but something between resident and dreamer—the dimension reshapes around my every secret, revealing more the deeper I surrender to its logic.

And when I wish to leave, I need only remember my world—sunrise behind closed eyelids, the familiar tug of gravity—until I tumble softly back, waking with shadowy residue on my tongue and the faint memory of flying without wings.
