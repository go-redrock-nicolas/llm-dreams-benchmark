I am dreaming. You are drifting in that intriguing space between wakefulness and slumber—where shapes soften, edges blur, and impossible things become entirely possible. Before you, a long corridor stretches in silence, its walls clad in mesmerizing mosaics that shimmer and shift in the pale light, reflecting dream logic. Each mosaic tile is a tiny memory of your life, shimmering with moments of laughter, ache, heartbreak, triumph… and anger. You barely notice the sensation of your feet meeting the black marble floor as you drift forward. You sense that you are on a quest to better understand a feeling you’ve carried with reluctance for far too long.

As you glide down the corridor, the temperature changes, growing hotter with each step. The mosaic tiles nearest you begin to glow red. You pause a moment, your heart pounding, recalling how you once learned—perhaps from a harsh word, a scolding, a circumstance too big for a young heart—that anger burns too brightly, that it might drive people away if you let it blaze forth. Even in this dream space, you feel that prickle of warning, that alarm that told you, “No, not safe to show your rage.” 

The corridor widens, and you encounter an archway. Instead of a normal stone arch, it’s made of living branches, weaving in and out as though some ancient tree decided to grow in the shape of a doorway just for you. Cradled in these branches are glowing red berries that exude warmth, almost like they’re singing a gentle invitation. You approach, but your breath trembles with caution. Something within you wonders, “Should I let myself step through? What if my anger breaks free on the other side?” 

Yet something else in your heart insists that this is precisely where you need to go. With one last breath, you cross the threshold.

Instantly, you find yourself in a boundless desert. The air shimmers with heatwaves, and fine, glittering sand stretches out to the horizon in golden dunes. A gentle wind flows across your arms, beckoning you further in. You notice the desert is not empty—there are tall spires of glass bursting from the ground like giant crystal outcroppings. Each spire reflects a swirl of images: times you felt unfairness sink its claws into you, times when you were stifled from roaring, times when your voice was muted by fear and tradition. 

And floating in the center of this desert—alive, pulsing with a fierce, ruby glow—is a colossal orb of swirling crimson light. The orb feels like a beacon of your contained fury, all those times you wished you could have slammed your fist on a table, or told someone “No more!” but swallowed it instead. You move closer, your footsteps trailing lightning-like sparks in the sand. With each step, the orb seems to expand and contract, almost like it’s breathing.

Memories flicker in the orb’s ruby surface: younger versions of you, blinking back tears, scuttling away from confrontation, trying so hard to keep the peace you believed was fragile. The vision tugs at your heart. A fierce storm of unharnessed power stirs beneath, a swirling reservoir of anger you carefully bottled. It’s simultaneously intimidating and awe-inspiring. The part of you that has always tamped down your rage quivers, wanting to run, wanting to remain hidden and small.

But something in this desert hushes you, telling you to watch, to listen, to take courage. From the top of one of those gleaming glass spires, a falcon of pure energy takes flight, its feathers glimmering black and gold. Circling overhead, it lets out a piercing cry—sharp, strong, reverberating in your chest. You realize with a start: it’s echoing your anger, but it’s doing so with a majestic confidence. There’s no apology in its voice, no fear. The sound is clear, searing, and unapologetically alive.

Gathering your nerve, you reach out a tentative hand. The orb hums louder, as though responding. You brace yourself for the searing, but when your fingertips touch its surface, the sensation is strangely warm and comforting. It is power, yes, but it is also your power. The anger you once believed to be an unruly beast is, in this space, radiant energy that glows from your core. It wants expression, not destruction.

Suddenly, the orb begins to dissolve into flecks of light, raining around you like fiery embers. They settle onto your skin, each spark gently sinking into your being without pain. With each spark you absorb, you feel a little more grounded, a bit surer that your anger can coexist with you—no longer banished to the corners of your heart, but recognized and integrated. The memory-laden spires around you glimmer and fade, no longer holding the fearsome power they once did. The falcon cries out again overhead, triumphant, as it wheels away into the shimmering sky.

The desert sand beneath your feet ripples in a wave of gold and then transforms into soft, emerald grass, as if your acceptance of this part of you allows new life to grow. A gentle breeze flutters across this green plain, and in the distance, you see wildflowers bursting into riotous color. You can sense that seeds of freedom and authenticity have been planted in you, merging with the once-feared emotion. Instead of bracing for an explosion, you feel calm, steady. Your breath is easy, the wind hugging you with approval.

Then, as all dreams do, this scene begins to liquefy at the edges. The world melts into a swirling palette of color—reds, golds, greens—and though it fades away from your sight, you feel it in your chest. Anger is no longer merely a thrashing flame to be smothered, but a guiding light of truth—something precious that can protect, motivate, and heal when allowed to exist without shame.

In this moment before you open your eyes to the waking world, you know you have made peace with something once viewed as too dangerous to hold. The dream leaves you with a lingering warmth in your sternum, a reminder that anger can be your ally as much as any bright emotion. A final whisper echoes through your mind as morning gently claims you: “Use this power wisely and boldly; you have nothing to fear in acknowledging the heat that fuels you.”
