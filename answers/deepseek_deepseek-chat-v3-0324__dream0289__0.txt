I am dreaming. The loss is a gaping chasm that has swallowed the sun, leaving the world cast in muted grays and blues. My chest feels hollow, as if my heart has been carved out with dull knives. The air itself seems thicker, heavier, pressing down on me like a leaden blanket. The scent of rain-soaked earth clings to everything, mingling with the faint, lingering traces of *her* perfume—something floral and soft, now bitter with absence.  

In this dreamscape of grief, I wander through a house that is both achingly familiar and unbearably wrong. The walls stretch and warp like taffy, elongating hallways into impossible distances. Frames hang crookedly, photos inside them melting like candle wax—*her* face dissolving before I can catch it. My footsteps echo too loud, too empty, as though the house rejects the sound of anyone but her.  

Then, the rain starts. Not outside, but *inside*, weeping from the ceiling in slow, fat droplets. The water pools at my feet, rising until it laps at my ankles. I look down and see my reflection—except it isn’t me. It’s *her*, mouthing words I can’t hear. I reach for the water, desperate, but the moment my fingers touch the surface, the whole room tilts violently.  

I fall—not down, but *sideways*, through the liquid mirror, into a place where time is undone. Memories play in reverse: laughter turning into sobs, embraces unraveling into outstretched hands pulling apart, shared meals dissolving into raw ingredients. And through it all, an immense, whispering absence murmurs in my bones, "You were not enough."  

Then, a tiny light. A pulse, faint but insistent, like the last ember in a dying fire. It hums—no, *sings*—a single wordless note that vibrates against my skin. It doesn’t fix what’s broken, but it stitches warmth into the edges of the wound. A voice, not hers but somehow *kin* to hers, says: "Not enough? Or *not yet*?"  

The dream fractures like ice underfoot—and I wake, gasping, clutching at a truth I can’t yet name.
