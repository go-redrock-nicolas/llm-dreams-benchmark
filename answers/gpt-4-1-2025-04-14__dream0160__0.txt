I am dreaming. …stand at the edge of a sprawling city scorched by flickering orange embers, the charred remains of skyscrapers etched against a bruised violet sky. The world feels silent, as though the air itself is holding its breath, heavy with the memory of disasters I’ve already endured—rejection letters littered like autumn leaves in crumpled heaps, public failures reverberating through cavernous, empty auditoriums, my own face splashed with disappointment reflected in a thousand digital screens.

Now, everything that was familiar—my credentials, my network, my professional identity—lies in a smoldering heap at my feet, warped by the flames of what appears to be an ultimate undoing. The city’s lights have gone out but, curiously, amidst the ruin, a slender stairway of moonlit stone rises, spiraling upward into the unknown. Each step hums with possibility, almost magnetic in its pull.

I feel the weight of all I’ve lost, yet for the first time, there is nothing left to defend. My pain feels like lightning in the veins—raw, vital, crackling with untapped energy. With a trembling exhale, I place one foot on the lowest step and ascend, leaving behind the ashes of my former self.

As I climb, spectral figures emerge from the shadows—fragments of my forgotten ambitions, idealistic dreams I’d buried, mentors I’d disappointed but who now whisper encouragement. At the top, I come to an amphitheater open to the night sky. Here, I see not an audience to judge me, but starlight swirling and condensing into new, unfamiliar constellations. My future is not erased but rewritten in the shimmering dark—a story no longer bound by resume or reputation, but by the resolve to begin again, to create from zero, to make something unimagined and entirely my own.

In the profound silence, I realize I have survived not in spite of failure, but because of it. My greatest asset is the courage that remains—undaunted, undefeated, illuminated by the wild hope that flickers even in the ruins. I stand ready to invent a new dawn.
