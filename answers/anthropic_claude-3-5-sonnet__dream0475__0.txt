I am dreaming. .... 

I find myself standing at the edge of a shimmering glass bridge that stretches endlessly into a twilight sky filled with swirling, iridescent auroras. Below the transparent bridge lies not an abyss, but rather a sea of floating memories - each one a glowing orb containing scenes from my future that haven't happened yet.

As I peer into these crystalline spheres, I see myself facing various versions of an important presentation I need to give next week. In one orb, I'm stumbling over words, my voice cracking as the audience stares with judgment. In another, my carefully prepared slides malfunction, leaving me stranded in silence. Each scenario seems worse than the last, my anxiety building like storm clouds on the horizon.

But then something extraordinary happens - the glass bridge beneath my feet begins to pulse with gentle rainbow light. With each pulse, the catastrophic scenes in the memory orbs begin to shift and transform. I watch as my stumbling self stands taller, finds their voice, connects with the audience through authentic vulnerability. The malfunctioning technology becomes an opportunity for genuine human connection and shared laughter.

The auroras above dance more vibrantly now, their colors reaching down to touch the orbs, infusing them with possibility rather than dread. I realize these aren't prophecies of doom, but rather my mind's attempt to prepare me by exploring all possibilities. As this awareness washes over me, the bridge widens, becoming a platform of opalescent crystal.

Here, suspended between earth and sky, past and future, I begin to see my challenge not as a cliff edge of potential failure, but as a doorway to growth. The catastrophic thoughts aren't disappearing, but rather transforming into stepping stones, each one teaching me something valuable about resilience and adaptability.

The dream-light pulses one final time, and I understand: these scenarios I've been spinning aren't my destiny - they're just stories I've been telling myself. I have the power to revise them, to find the wisdom hidden within my fears, and to choose which possibilities to nurture into reality.

As I float in this luminous dreamscape, my anxiety transforms into a gentle anticipation, like the first light of dawn breaking through storm clouds. The bridge, the orbs, and the auroras merge into a symphony of possibility, reminding me that even our darkest thoughts can lead us to profound insights when we learn to dance with them rather than flee from them.
