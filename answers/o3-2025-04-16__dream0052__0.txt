I am dreaming. …draw in a long, trembling breath, and the entire dream holds it with you.

You are standing on the deck of a ship woven out of moonlight and piano wire, its sails billowing with silent music. Below, an indigo sea laps against nothing at all—each wave a curl of lavender smoke that dissolves before it can kiss the hull. Overhead, constellations drift like lanterns set loose from a distant festival, their shimmering trails spelling out half-remembered lullabies you once hummed as a child.

A hush spreads as figures gather—people you know and people you’ve lost, people who were never real yet somehow taught you kindness. They materialize from the mist in formal rows: your grandmother stitched from quilt squares, the neighbor’s dog wearing reading glasses, an ex-lover whose face is a flickering film reel of every “what if” you never dared voice. All of them look to you with held breath, waiting.

At the bow, a messenger approaches. She is crafted from origami cranes; their folded wings rustle with every step, scattering tiny silver feathers that evaporate into the night. In her papier-thin palms rests a sealed envelope whose wax burns without melting. Inside—a single sentence written in ink the color of sunrise:

“Tomorrow will not exist unless your heart decides it should.”

The words blaze across your mind, searing through every wall you’ve ever built. Time fractures; the deck tilts. Stars hiccup. Your pulse becomes a thunderstorm desperate for purchase.

Shock arrives first—a shard of ice dropped into molten metal. It hisses, cracks, vanishes. Then grief, rising like a tidal wave of amber honey, slow but unstoppable, threatening to swallow your ribs. Elation follows on its heels, an electric hush that makes your fingertips ring with the promise of impossible power. Terror circles all of it, a black-winged albatross whose shadow lengthens across the deck.

Eyes—hundreds of them—stay fixed on you. You feel their hopes perch on your shoulders like fledgling birds, fragile and fluttering.

So you pause.

You close your eyes, and the world ceases to spin. Quite literally: the constellations freeze mid-twinkle, the smoke-waves halt in their curl, even the candleflame of the messenger’s seal stands unmoving. The universe agrees to wait.

Inside that pause, you travel inward.

You find yourself in a hidden room of your own mind: a round chamber tiled with memories. Each tile thrums with color—first bike ride (sun-yellow), midnight laugh with friends (neon turquoise), the taste of rain on a June afternoon (petrichor green). At the center sits a fragile, humming thing: your heart, but not of flesh and muscle. It is an astrolabe forged from rose-quartz gears and soft-spun light. It ticks with the metronome of your life, and right now its hands tremble.

You reach out. The gear-teeth are cool, slicked with dew. You whisper to it—nothing cathartic or grand, just honest words: “I don’t know if I’m enough, but I want tomorrow.”

With that confession, a single filament of gold threads outward from the astrolabe, snakes through the corridors of the ship, and tethers itself to the sky. Somewhere far away, dawn inhales for the first time.

When you open your eyes, color floods the dream. The lavender sea flares magenta, the moonlit hull shines liquid chrome. Every face before you softens—the quilted grandmother smiles, the spectacled dog wags precisely once, the ex-lover’s film reel slows to a steady frame.

A roar climbs your throat—a sound equal parts battle cry and lullaby. You lift the envelope high; its wax finally drips, sizzling against the deck like tiny meteors. “Then let there be a tomorrow,” you declare, voice ringing in languages you do not consciously know.

Thunder applauds. The sails ignite into auroras. The ship surges forward, slicing the indigo smoke-water into ribbons of amethyst and gold. Behind you, the crowd erupts in jubilant laughter, like glass wind chimes caught in a warm gale.

Somewhere at the far rim of dream, the horizon blushes peach. It is the first hint of a tomorrow that should not have been—but will be, because you felt everything, paused, chose, and spoke.

And the universe, in all its impossible vastness, answered, “Yes.”
