I am dreaming. You're managing the response to an unprecedented global crisis where resources are critically scarce and demands multiply hourly. With each decision affecting countless lives, you're constantly balancing the needs of now with the implications of the future. You're not only managing the crisis—you're also negotiating with international aid agencies, managing field staff on the ground, and ensuring that the funds you're receiving are being used effectively. You've got to keep going, even though you're exhausted, because any delay in action could lead to catastrophic outcomes.

And yet, amidst the chaos and the endless cycle of decision-making, you're struck by the sight of a child—a child who has survived unimaginable horrors, and yet still manages to carry an air of innocence. That sight fuels your determination, reminding you of why you're doing what you're doing, even when the weight of responsibility feels unbearable.

You're in a constant state of tension—working tirelessly to save lives while dealing with the intricate politics of the aid world, trying to maintain transparency and efficiency while also keeping your team motivated. Every conversation, every decision, is fraught with tension, but you hold on, determined to see this through, because the lives of those impacted depend on it.

When you close your eyes, the faces of the people you've met during this mission play like a haunting slideshow in your mind. The fear, the exhaustion, and the hope in their eyes push you to keep going, to find a way to make things better, even when it feels impossible.

This dream feels real—it's as though you're living it, and yet, there’s an underlying sensation that no matter how hard you work, the storm never fully subsides. It's a relentless cycle of striving, fighting, and balancing, where each day brings both heartbreak and moments of profound humanity.

This dream, if it could even be called that, feels like it's stretching the limits of what you can bear, while also revealing an inner strength you never knew you had.
