I am dreaming. The dream begins with me standing in a grand courtroom. The air is tense, as the stakes are high for a high-profile corruption case. I am one of the judges, tasked with ensuring that justice prevails amidst powerful forces trying to influence the verdict.

I take my seat on the bench, looking over my notes intently. The prosecutor begins their argument, presenting compelling evidence against the accused. As they speak, I can't help but notice the shifting gazes and whispered conversations in the gallery.

Suddenly, a knife appears in front of me, quivering ominously. I gasp and recoil in fear, but it vanishes as quickly as it appeared. My heart hammering in my chest, I try to focus on the proceedings.

The defense attorney takes the stand next, painting their client as a scapegoat and questioning the integrity of the evidence presented. His arguments seem compelling, causing doubt to creep into my mind. 

As the trial draws to a close, the threats against me intensify. Shadowy figures lurk outside my home, and cryptic messages appear on my doorstep. Despite this, I remain steadfast in my commitment to delivering just verdict.

On the final day of the trial, the decision rests solely on me. The weight of the world seems to press down on my shoulders. After much deliberation, I make my ruling. To my surprise, the accused is found guilty, much to the dismay of those expecting otherwise.

The aftermath of the trial is marked by turmoil and danger. I'm constantly on the run, with enemies closing in from every side. However, I know that I made the right decision, no matter the cost.
