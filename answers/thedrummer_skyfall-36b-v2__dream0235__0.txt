I am dreaming. As you drift off into the fuzzy haze of slumber, the world around you begins to shift and morph, colors bleeding into strange new forms. Yet this is not a mundane dream no, you find yourself standing in a dimly lit chamber, the air thick with an uncontainable energy. 


A figure approaches from the shadows, draped in flowing robes that shimmer with an otherworldly iridescence. As they draw nearer, you notice their eyes they glimmer with an almost rooted knowledge, ancient and all-seeing. They raise a hand in a trio of graceful gestures, as if welcoming you to a sacred space.

Without warning, the walls around you dissolve into an expanse of billowing mist. The figure beckons you forward, and you feel your feet moving against your own will, drawn to their mystifying presence. They lead you through the swirling fog, the only constant being their shimmering form ahead of you.

As the mist parts, a monstrous building comes into view. Its spires reach towards a moonless sky, and its ancient stones seem to pulse with an inner light. The figure ushers you inside, and you find yourself standing in the heart of the temple.

All around you, figures in robes glow and sway in unison this is the community. They move with a fluid grace, gestures rippling through them like water. A hand pressed to the heart speaks of joy, a slow turn of the body conveys sorrow. Anger manifests as sharp, staccato motions, while peace descends like a gentle, settling snow.

You try to speak, but find your mouth sealed shut, your throat locked tight. A wave of panic surges through you how can you possibly communicate, let alone connect, in this strange new world? 

But then you feel it a nubition within you comes alive, a buried instinct rising to the surface. Shooting strangers in front of you, you feel a bodysocking warmth spreading through you, a deep resonance with the movements of the community.

Gently, you raise your hand, mimicking the gestures you've seen. Reaching within yourself, you pour your essence into the motions, infusing them with your own unique essence. The community around you stirs, their eyes fixed upon you with an intensity that borders on reverence.

And then they respond, their movements answering your call, engaging with you in a dance of pure expression. Joy, sorrow, anger, love it all flows between you, a current of raw, unfiltered emotion. You are struck by the beauty of this unspoken language, the depth of connection it allows.

As the dream begins to fade, you feel yourself still moving, still communicating, even as the world of the waking begins to reassert itself. You awaken with a start, the memories of your dreamy encounter still vivid in your mind. In that moment, you know that you too can connect authentically within the framework of this community without ever opening your mouth.
