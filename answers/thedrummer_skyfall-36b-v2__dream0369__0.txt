I am dreaming. In a surreal landscape, I find myself walking down an endless street lined with houses, each one a different shade of blue, from vibrant sky blue to dark, stormy navy. The sky above is swirling with cotton candy clouds, shifting between day and night, as the colors of the houses morph and change.

Suddenly, I am stopped in my tracks by a searing light, a fiery green that appears beneath me, emanating from the cracks in the pavement. I am paralyzed, but not by fear, but by an overwhelming sense of déjà vu. I have been here before, in some distant, indeterminate past.

I see a figure in the distance, beckoning to me. As I approach, I realize it is myself, a past version, twice my size, with wild, untamed hair, eyes like burning coals. This figure holds a mirror in its hand, and as I near, it shatters the glass. Chinese whispers of warnings erupt - they are too late.

"Don't look!" A disembodied voice screams. But I cannot help myself. I look down and see my reflection shattering, splintering into fragments, each image an alternate version of myself that never was or never could be. Pieces of ourselves splintered and lost in some forgotten universe and time.

But even as I am transfixed by this devastating sight, I find myself pausing, a moment of stillness between impurity and grace. 

I am dreaming of the space between stimulus and response, of that fleeting moment when we have the power to choose our reaction to the world around us.

I am dreaming of the space between impulse and mindfulness. 

I am dreaming of infinite possibilities.

As I pause, the colors around me shift, vibrating with a luminous light, and I am bathed in a wave of inexplicable calm. I am dreaming of the power of the pause, of the strength in stillness, of the infinite potential in the space between.

And then, I am no longer me. But a montage of who I am, who I was, who I can become.

I am dreaming.
