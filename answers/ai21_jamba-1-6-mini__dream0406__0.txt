I am dreaming. Suddenly, I find myself standing on a massive glass bridge suspended high above a swirling, multi-colored galaxy. The stars twinkle like tiny prisms, casting dancing lights in every direction, with each winking dot of light carrying the flicker of distant memories and aspirations. The bridge stretches endlessly before me and behind me, shimmering and solid under my feet, yet somehow translucent, allowing me to see the intricate beauty of the galaxies below.

As I stand there, scanning the horizon, I see a figure in the distance. They are approaching me with long, steady strides, and as they get closer, I realize it's me—but a version of me that I have never seen before. This version of me radiates confidence, wearing radiant armor, sparkling with the reflection of a thousand stars, and they wield a luminous staff that crackles with golden energy. Their aura is magnetic, their step sure and steady. The new me stops and smiles, though not a smile of joy but one filled with understanding.

"Why do you always conceal the very essence of who you are?" they ask, their voice echoing across the vast cosmic expanse. I feel a sense of warmth emanating from them, and I realize this version of me is a culmination of my deepest desires and the truest version of myself. "The universe does not hide its brilliance," they continue, "so neither should you."

As they speak, the air around me changes. The stars around my body begin to pulse, releasing tiny golden threads that weave themselves into a glorious garland, draping itself around my shoulders like a royal cloak. Each thread is a different color, each color representing a part of me that I often suppress — the , the , the , and the . These threads grow stronger and more brilliant as the dream progresses, as if to say, "These threads are your strength, your beauty."

As I marvel at this new version of me, I feel the weight of my self-perceptions shifting. I start to understand that the downplay of my achievements and the magnification of my shortcomings are crutches I've leaned on, crutches that I've come to believe I need to feel "real." But the new me, in their superior wisdom, shows me that these self-doubts are merely shadows I've cast on myself, shadows that make me play smaller than the grand figure I truly am.

I step closer, reaching out to touch the face of this radiant version of myself. My hand meets their cheek, and it’s as if time pauses. A calm serenity washes over me, the bridge beneath our feet giving way to an endless expanse of stars, but I am unafraid. The dream is so vivid, I can feel the texture of the golden threads, the weight of the radiant cloak on my shoulders, and the tingle of cosmic energy in the air.

The dream shimmers with colors I've never seen before, each hue more vibrant than the last, and despite the confusion, there is a comforting undercurrent that hums with possibility. I look at the new me, my own doppelganger of self-doubt turned self-love, and I understand without a word. The stars around us continue to pulse, each one sending a wave of soothing energy through my body.

And then, as quickly as it began, the dream starts to fade. I feel myself floating back into my body, but the experience lingers in my mind. I wake with a newfound determination, the echoes of my dream still lingering on my lips. I am ready to let go of the crutch of downplaying my worth and magnifying my insecurities. Instead, I will step forward, honoring every thread of my being — every strength, every weakness, every creation, and every potential I have yet to uncover. I am whole, I am complete, and I am ready to shine.
