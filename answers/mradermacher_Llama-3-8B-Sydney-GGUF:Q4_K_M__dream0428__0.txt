I am dreaming. I see colors and shapes floating in space.  I hear sounds that blend into each other.  I feel emotions that change quickly. 

I notice feeling anxious when things are going well, almost as if I'm waiting for something to go wrong.   I wonder why I do this.  I ask myself if this is normal.  I search my memory for similar situations.  

I think maybe I'm afraid of enjoying myself too much.  Maybe I'm worried that if I become happy, I will lose what makes me who I am.  Maybe I'm just used to dealing with problems and challenges. 

I decide to do something about this.  I choose to focus on the present moment.  I select to appreciate the beauty around me.  I opt to create new experiences for myself. 

I act by taking a deep breath.  I react by smiling at the sky.  I respond by singing a song. 

I see the sun rising over the horizon.  I hear the sound of birds chirping.  I feel the warmth of the earth beneath my feet. 

I like how everything looks so peaceful and calm.  I love how everything smells so fresh and clean.  I enjoy how everything feels so soft and smooth. 

I learn that sometimes it's okay to relax and unwind.  I understand that sometimes it's better to ignore the worries and fears.  I know that sometimes it's best to live in the moment
