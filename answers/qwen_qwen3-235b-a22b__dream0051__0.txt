I am dreaming. The sky above me ripples like silk woven from sapphire and flame—an impossible horizon where azure bleeds into violet, and stars flicker like thoughts half-remembered. I am at the helm of a silver-winged aircraft, sleek as a comet, its fuselage humming with the pulse of engines that are more poetry than machinery. Outside, the clouds are not mere vapor but colossal levitating gardens, sprouting luminous flora that sway in slow motion, untouched by earthly gravity.

At first, all is serene. The passengers behind me murmur in hushed tones, their voices like leaves rustling in some forgotten cathedral of the sky. But then, without warning, the aircraft shudders—a violent tremor that sears through the cockpit like a scream from the void. The control panels flicker, dials spinning wildly, and then—blackout. Gone.

The autopilot chirps one last time before falling silent.

Below me, the clouds split open like the skin of a wound, revealing a churning abyss filled with spirals of liquid gold and rainbows suspended in midair. I realize I’m not flying over the world I know anymore—I’ve slipped into something older, stranger… a dream woven from the deepest threads of the mind’s forgotten tapestry.

Warning lights flare to life in a burst of crimson and gold, each one screaming failure. Avionics: critical. Power: destabilizing. Compass: spinning. The aircraft groans like a beast waking from a long slumber, somehow aware, sentient. I have seconds—maybe less.

Adrenaline floods my veins. My fingers claw at switches, dials, and levers that flicker between familiarity and fantasy—one moment they're normal controls, the next they’ve twisted into thrones of crystal and bone. The yoke resists my grip, as if the plane itself is hesitating, afraid. But I am not.

Behind me, passengers are chanting now, their voices rising in fear—but I hear something else in their chorus… belief. They don’t know who I am, but they’ve placed every heartbeat they have left in my hands.

I bank hard to the left, diving into a cloud shaped like a serpent devouring its own tail. Wind tears at the plane. Lightning dances across the wings, singing contactless lullabies. I log a memory of falling, but it’s not the kind that leads to death—it's the kind that leads to reckoning.

Then—clarity.

The emergency override lies beneath a hatch guarded by mechanisms I don’t remember seeing before… but I *feel* it, like an instinct buried in a life I never lived. My hand moves before my mind can follow, pulling the lever. Time seems to stretch—someone recites an ancient poem from inside the engine noise, someone sobs, someone laughs… and then the plane ignites with light.

No longer a machine, it unfolds.

Metal petals burst open around the wings, crafting a celestial vessel of pure thought and will. I rise from the pilot’s seat though I make no motion to move. My skin glows faintly, my eyes reflecting galaxies I could never chart.

We are saved—not by science, not by reason, but by surrender to something older than flight: *intention.*

Floating above a cathedral built of floating bones and singing stars, I see the world anew: the shimmering labyrinths of the dream-world coiling below, where nightmare and wonder meet in surreal embrace.

I am awake inside the dream… and it will never let me go.

Yet I smile.

Because in this universe, there is no such thing as crash… only awakening.
