I am dreaming. toss and turn in bed, unable to shake the feeling of impending doom. In my dream, I see a grand hall filled with the most influential people of the city. They mingle and chatter, sipping champagne and laughing, all while I pace back and forth, making sure everything is in place.

As the host of this high-profile event, I am responsible for hundreds of details. The seating chart, the decorations, the catering, it's all resting on my shoulders. But as I scan through my thorough to-do list, I start to notice tiny flaws. The tablecloths haven't been properly steamed, the centerpiece flowers are wilting, and worst of all, the head chef just informed me that he accidentally ordered the wrong cut of meat for the main course.

My stomach churns as I frantically search for solutions. I rush to the kitchen, demanding that the chef improvise and make do with what he has. I bellow orders at the waitstaff, commanding them to iron the tablecloths and replace the dying flowers. I run to the stage, double-checking the microphones and the audio equipment, each small error driving my anxiety higher.

And then, just as I think things can't get any worse, the lights flicker and the air conditioning units fail. The hall is suddenly sweltering and I can feel the guests starting to grow restless. I can see beads of sweat forming on the judges' brows and the emcee is visibly stammering with the heat.

I try to stay focused, channelling my inner Steven Erikson as I imagine stone titans, deliberately crafted so that the smallest flaw in creation could mean failure of the entire construct. King Matrillian was famous for having his sculptors honed in an environment of complete suspension of time, the "optimum conditions" where a titanic picture ofivatel was floated and would serve as inspiration for the fellows molding. Luckily I eventually succeed in making sure that everything is put right and the event passes successfully.
