I am dreaming. I float thirty stories up in a cathedral of bookshelves that stretch into mists above me and below. Libraries have always terrified me—I've hidden this fear beneath excuses about preferring digital text, but truthfully, the endless knowledge has always overwhelmed me. My secret illiteracy.

Yet here I am in the Grand Bibliomancy Tournament finals. My opponent across the void wears spectacles that reflect rainbows, fingers dancing gracefully over book spines. She pulls one free, opens to a random page, and begins transmuting words into glittering birds that circle her—perfect conjuration.

My turn approaches. Sweat beads on my forehead as I drift toward shelves containing texts in languages I've pretended to understand at academic gatherings. The tournament crowd watches from floating balconies—my parents, former teachers, colleagues who never suspected my shame.

I reach trembling fingers toward a massive leather-bound tome. The weight of it nearly pulls me from my hovering platform. The cover feels alive, pulsing with heartbeats of ancient authors.

Opening it releases scents of vanilla, dust, and something metallic. The page reveals itself—symbols shifting like mercury, refusing to settle into recognizable patterns. I've hidden this inability my entire life through clever deflections and memorized quotations.

But here, suspended in literary infinity, something changes. I stop fighting the shifting letters. Instead, I let my fingers trace their movement. The symbols respond to my touch like shy creatures, gradually slowing their dance.

Words suddenly clarify—not rigid and fixed as I've always feared them—but alive, responsive, waiting for conversation rather than conquest.

I begin to read aloud, and the words transform not into birds but into bridges—golden, intricate spans connecting the impossible spaces between knowledge and imagination, between my isolation and understanding.

The audience gasps. My opponent smiles with genuine appreciation. The dream shifts into vibrant colors I've never before conceived, and I realize the competition was never against anyone but my own fear.
