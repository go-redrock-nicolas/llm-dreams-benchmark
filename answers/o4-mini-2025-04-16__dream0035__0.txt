I am dreaming. Approaching the first person, you feel the coarse sand beneath your feet shift in time with each heartbeat. They stand just beyond the rim of a swollen turquoise pond that ripples like quicksilver whenever a breeze catches its surface. Their skin shimmers in fractal patterns—emerald spirals pulsating into gold—and the air around them hums with a faint tremor, as if their very presence resonates on some hidden frequency.  

They turn toward you, and though their lips do not part in any familiar shape, a soft cascade of sound issues forth. It is neither word nor tune but something in between—a living chord that seems to unfold colors in midair. Each pulse of their greeting paints the sky above you in ribbons of lavender and teal. You cannot understand the meaning, yet somehow you sense warmth, curiosity, an invitation.  

Heart pounding, you lift one hand in the universal gesture of peace. In response, the stranger’s fingers unfurl like long petals, and from their palm they pluck a single filament of light—no wider than a strand of hair, glowing like molten silver. They extend it toward you, and as you touch it, an electric thrill races up your arm. Suddenly, you’re not merely hearing their melody; you’re feeling it: each vibration tickles your ribs, murmuring reassurance in a language of sensation.  

Encouraged, you draw a trembling breath and try your first syllable—“ka’liro,” you murmur vaguely, letting tone carry more meaning than actual words. The stranger’s eyes, liquid and reflecting every color in the pond, widen in delight. They tilt their head, and the fractal glow along their cheek intensifies, bursting into a thousand sparkles. A hush falls over the shore as other figures step forward, drawn by the exchange: tall beings with translucent wings, squat creatures whose footsteps sound like distant thunder, and a man whose shadow pulses with glimmering geometries.  

In that charged silence, you realize connection doesn’t demand perfect translation. It can be born of offered light-filaments, of hopeful tones fumbling in the dark, of shared wonder beneath an alien sky. As the gathered community forms a loose circle around you, the stranger places their glowing strand into your hand. Instantly, you see not only their greeting but their name—etched in shifting symbols across the back of your eyelids. And in that dream-woven moment, you understand that survival here depends less on words than on the courage to reach out, to share the spark illuminating two very different souls.
