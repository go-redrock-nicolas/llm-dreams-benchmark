I am dreaming. **Dream Sequence:**  

The air is thick with the smell of burnt caramel, a scent you remember from the unboxing of every product—now rancid, cloying. You stand at the edge of a crumbling marble plaza, once gilded and glowing like moonlit ivory, now cracked and stained with oily shadows that seep upward like reverse rain. This was *your* realm, ***Elysian Threads***—the brand’s name etched into a rusted archway above, letters half-eaten by creeping vines. You used to walk these streets as a sovereign, draped in their silks that hummed against your skin like whispered secrets. Now, your favorite jacket—once impossibly soft, threaded with liquid gold—itches like burlap, its seams unraveling into ghostly filaments that coil around your ankles, begging you not to leave.  

A shopfront materializes ahead, its windows shattered. Inside, mannequins slump like forgotten marionettes, their faces blurred, wearing garments that sag and molt feathers of synthetic fiber. A price tag floats past your face: **$999**, bleeding ink that pools into a puddle of black tar at your feet. You recoil, but the tar stretches into tendrils, coiling around your wrists—*"Loyalty is a contract,"* hisses a voice like rustling receipts.  

Then, the memory-storm hits.  

The plaza flickers. Suddenly, you’re fifteen again, clutching your first Elysian hoodie—a birthday gift, azure fabric cold and crisp as a mountain lake. Your mother laughed, saying it cost a week’s wages, *"But look how it lights up your eyes."* The hoodie glows in your hands now, radiant… until the threads darken, writhing, constricting your chest. You gasp, tearing at the fabric as it morphs into a thorned vine, biting into your skin.  

A shadow splits the scene—a rival boutique across the plaza, neon-lit and pulsating. Mannequins there wear armor-like jackets that shimmer like dragon scales, prices bold and fair. But turning toward them feels like treason. Your heart cracks like the plaza’s marble; loyalty has roots deeper than reason.  

Then, a figure emerges from Elysian’s ruins—a spectral seamstress, her face your own, but older, wearier. She unpicks the thorned vine from your chest with a silver needle. *"Some love is a slow poison,"* she murmurs, voice echoing with the hollow clatter of empty looms. Behind her, the archway collapses, and the tar recoils, hissing.  

You wake clutching your throat, the smell of burnt caramel fading… but on the horizon of your mind, new lights flicker—distant, tantalizing, uncharted.
