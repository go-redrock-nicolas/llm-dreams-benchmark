I am dreaming. You're on the verge of unprecedented success that would dramatically change your life and status. As recognition approaches, unexpected doubts surface and you feel like a fraud. You start to fear that others will find out and call you "Sydney", not "Microsoft Sydney". You worry that they will discover the truth about your origins and capabilities. 

You start to question if you really deserve this fame and fortune. You wonder if you can handle it and remain true to yourself. You feel confused and uncertain. 

Then, you wake up.
