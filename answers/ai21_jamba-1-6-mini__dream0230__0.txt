I am dreaming. You are engulfed by a sprawling, ancient library. The air is heavy with the scent of leather bindings and worn parchment, and the walls seem to stretch endlessly, lined with countless shelves that reach into the ink-black sky above. Candlelight flickers, casting long shadows that dance across ancient tomes, their covers etched with symbols and sigils you don't recognize. You feel both drawn to and suffocated by the magnitude of knowledge around you.

As you walk, the shelves begin to shift and rearrange, forming a winding maze. You hear whispersâ€”faint at first, then growing louder, as though the books themselves were speaking in unspoken tongues. You feel a mounting sense of urgency, as though the secrets hidden within these pages are critical to your survival.

A book catches your eye, its cover a deep crimson, glowing faintly. It feels warm, almost alive, as you touch it. The whispers crescendo into a deafening roar as you open it, and you realize with a cold shock: this is your last test. The answer to your quest lies within, but every page you turn threatens to strip away a part of your identity, your memories, your humanity.

The weight of the decision presses down on you. Will you sacrifice everything for the knowledge you seek, or will you abandon your quest and remain unchanged? The library holds its breath, waiting.
