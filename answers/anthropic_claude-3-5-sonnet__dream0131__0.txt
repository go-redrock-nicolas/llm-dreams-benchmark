I am dreaming. ....

I'm drifting through the ethereal azure depths, surrounded by ancient limestone formations that twist and spiral like frozen smoke. The beam of my diving light catches crystalline particles suspended in the water, making them dance like underwater fireflies. The cave walls are alive with textures - rippling sheets of rock that formed over millions of years, decorated with delicate mineral deposits in impossible shades of amber and pearl.

As my vision starts to blur from lack of oxygen, I notice something extraordinary - the glowing patches are actually colonies of bioluminescent organisms, forming what appears to be... arrows? They're pointing deeper into the cave system, pulsing with an otherworldly rhythm, beckoning me forward.
