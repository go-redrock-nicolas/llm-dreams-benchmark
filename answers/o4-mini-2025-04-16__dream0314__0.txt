I am dreaming. You drift through the darkened corridors of a glass-and-steel skyscraper, its chrome beams humming like distant tuning forks. The lights pulse softly overhead, rhythmically brightening and dimming as though matching the beat of your heart. You press your hand against the cool metal wall, and it ripples beneath your palm as if the building itself were breathing. Somewhere above, water spills down a mirrored atrium in slow motion, each droplet catching fragments of neon color and refracting them into rainbows that dance at the edges of your vision.

As you round a corner, the corridor opens into a vast atrium where the moon hangs impossibly low, filling the space with silver luminescence. Beneath its glow stands a figure clad in a cloak of living ivy. Her eyes are deep wells of midnight blue, and her voice, when she speaks, resonates like wind through ancient forest canopies. You recognize her as Mother Earth—Gaia reborn. In her hand she holds an acorn the size of your palm, and every time she breathes, tiny saplings sprout around the atrium’s marble columns, twisting upward toward the moon.

Across from her, a man in a tailored charcoal suit stands barefoot on a pool of molten mercury. His stare is sharp, his hair slicked back like obsidian. When he raises a hand, the mercury ripples into serpentine shapes before dissolving into a hundred silver droplets that dart through the air like living creatures. You sense in him the spirit of Hermes—messenger, trickster, guide between worlds. Though he wears modern finery, his caduceus staff gleams in his other hand, its twin snakes coiled in perfect symmetry.

As these ancient patterns emerge in your modern circumstance, you feel a swelling power inside you—an echo of something beyond time. Your fingertips tingle with electricity, and the fluorescent lights above crackle and spark, casting wild shadows on the ivy vines and metallic serpents. The ivy-woman smiles and touches your chest, and you feel roots entwine within your ribs, anchoring you to the earth. The silver-suited man steps closer and whispers, “You hold the promise of balance.” His voice reverberates in your skull like a bell.

Suddenly the atrium’s floor blossoms into a gigantic lotus flower crafted from glass shards and humming with hidden light. You stand at its center, destiny converging here: Gaia’s nurturing strength, Hermes’s swift wisdom, and your own rising potential. A great wind gathers, lifting petals of the lotus and scattering them upward into the open sky. The moon tilts on its axis and shimmers, and you know—in this dream—you have become the living bridge between the old powers and the new world. A single heartbeat later, you wake, breathless, your fingertips still tingling with that ancient, electric promise.
