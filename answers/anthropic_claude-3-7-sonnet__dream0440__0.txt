I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, prismatic library that stretches beyond comprehension. Each book on the infinite shelves glows with its own inner light—some pulsing crimson like heartbeats, others shimmering with oceanic blues or the gentle gold of childhood memories. I realize this is no ordinary collection; these are the stories I've told myself since before I could speak.

My fingers trace the spine of a particularly heavy tome bound in what feels like iron. Opening it releases the scent of playground dirt and autumn leaves. Inside, written in a child's unsteady hand: "Love must be earned through perfection." Each page chronicles moments when I learned to measure my worthiness through achievements—a parent's distracted nod at a report card, the conditional praise that followed success and the silence after failure.

Suddenly, the book begins to transform in my hands. The iron binding softens, becoming supple leather the color of sunrise. The words rearrange themselves: "Love exists independent of achievement."

A librarian appears beside me—or perhaps she was always there—with my grandmother's eyes but stars scattered through her silver hair. "Those early chapters were written when you were too young to hold the pen," she says. "But you're the author now."

She guides me to a writing desk bathed in impossible light. The ink in the well shifts colors like the northern lights, and I understand that each stroke I make rewrites neural pathways decades in the forming.

I begin to write new truths in this dream-ink: "Worthiness is my birthright." The words lift from the page, floating into the air, becoming constellations above me. "Abundance flows toward openness, not striving." These letters become rain, gentle on my upturned face.

As I write, the library around me expands and contracts with my breath, as if the architecture itself responds to this internal revolution. I realize the shelves are within me, the books my beliefs, the ceiling my perceived limits.

The dream deepens. I am simultaneously writing and being written, revising and being revised.
