I am dreaming. The sky above me is an endless swirl of liquid gold and indigo, like oil paint stirred by a celestial hand. I stand at the entrance of a towering glass citadel, its spires piercing the clouds. Inside, a hushed murmur of voices—brilliant minds, luminaries in fields I scarcely understand—wait for me in a grand atrium humming with holographic schematics and floating equations.  

I’ve been summoned, though no one told me why. A woman with iridescent eyes and a suit woven from starlight steps forward. *"You’re leading this,"* she says, pressing a smooth, weightless tablet into my hands. Data streams in languages I don’t recognize; diagrams unfold like living origami.  

I want to say *I don’t belong here*, but my voice is a silver thread lost in the wind. The team watches—a physicist with fractal tattoos, a biologist whose fingertips glow with bioluminescence, an engineer who speaks to machines in harmonic resonance. They expect genius. They expect vision. All I feel is the dizzying pull of the unknown.  

Yet, when I open my mouth, the doubt transforms. My words aren’t mine—they’re pulled from the dream itself, lyrical and precise. The team leans in. The holograms ripple in response. A design takes shape—something impossible, something breathtaking. For the first time, I see it: the project isn’t about expertise. It’s about something far stranger. It’s about *believing* the dream into reality.  

And then, for the briefest moment, I do.
