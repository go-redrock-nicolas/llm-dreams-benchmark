I am dreaming.

In this dreamscape, the boundary between word and world dissolves into shimmering mist. I find myself standing in a vast, sun-dappled forest, where the air is so clear that every sound is like a brushstroke on my mind. As I walk, I notice words drifting lazily on the golden beams of light, their letters curling and reforming with each stray breeze. Some are tender—“soft,” “gentle,” “warm”—and each time I whisper them, I feel a gentle tide of comfort blossoming through my chest, as if I were wrapped in a silken cocoon.

Marveling, I begin to experiment. I call out to the woods, my voice echoing with subtle modifications: instead of saying “I am lost,” I try, “I am exploring.” Instantly, the oppressive shadows recede, and the forest path brightens with wildflowers, their colors deepening—a vivid coral here, a deep sapphire there. The change is seismic in its subtlety; what felt fearful now blooms with anticipation. Leaves flutter and small animals peek out, responding to my charged language.

I become bolder. “I am struggling” transforms into “I am learning.” The sensation of burden lightens into curiosity. Where there were thick brambles, there are now winding, navigable vines guiding me upward. I speak “I am overwhelmed,” but shape it anew: “I am surrounded by opportunity.” The sky parts just enough to reveal a radiant aurora, threads of emerald and indigo dancing with promise. My heart, once a quivering bird, becomes a soaring hawk.

With each shift, my world shifts, and I realize the forest is not just around me but also within me—a living mirror of my own inner landscape, shaped by the very syllables I choose. I become a sculptor, carving my reality with each tender or courageous word, painting my emotions with vocabulary I once underestimated. The sensation is intoxicating, a revelation that language is not merely a tool for communication but a key that unlocks different portals to the soul.

As my dreamself wanders deeper, I gather the words like rare flowers, tucking them close. Their scent lingers—serene, bold, hopeful—reminding me, even as dawn stretches its gold fingers across my eyelids, that every thought I choose has the power to become a new world within and without.
