I am dreaming. drift into a world that feels both alien and intimately familiar, a place where the boundaries of reality blur and shimmer like a mirage in a desert of thought. The sky above me is not blue, but a swirling canvas of liquid amethyst, streaked with veins of molten gold that pulse as though alive, casting an otherworldly glow on everything below. The ground beneath my feet is soft, almost cushiony, made of what seems to be woven moss in shades of deep emerald and sapphire, springing gently with every step I take. The air hums with a low, melodic vibration, as if the world itself is singing a lullaby only half-remembered from childhood.

In my hand, I clutch a sleek, glassy device—a smartphone, but not quite. Its surface ripples like water under my touch, notifications blooming like tiny lotus flowers across the screen, each one a glowing orb of light begging for my attention. I feel the familiar tug, that compulsive itch to check, to scroll, to drown in the endless stream of digital whispers. My heart races with the need to know, to connect, to not miss out. But something in me resists—a deep, primal urge to break free, to be present in this surreal dreamscape that feels more real than the waking world I’ve left behind.

With a surge of willpower, I toss the device into the air. It doesn’t fall. Instead, it shatters into a thousand luminous butterflies, their wings painted with fragments of memes, messages, and fleeting images of faces I think I should know. They flutter away, scattering into the violet sky, and I feel a weight lift off my chest, as if I’ve shed a layer of invisible chains. My breath comes easier now, and I turn my gaze to the horizon, where a forest of crystalline trees rises, their branches tinkling like wind chimes in a breeze I cannot feel.

I walk toward them, drawn by a pull I can’t explain. The trees are not made of wood or glass but of pure, frozen light, refracting the sky’s colors into dazzling prisms that dance across the mossy ground. As I step into the forest, the air grows thicker, sweeter, tasting faintly of honey and something wild, untamed. I hear whispers—not from notifications now, but from the trees themselves. They murmur secrets in a language I don’t understand but somehow feel, like the echo of a memory I haven’t lived yet. They tell me to listen, to look, to be.

Ahead, a clearing opens up, and in its center stands a pool of liquid mirror, its surface perfectly still, reflecting not the sky but a version of me I’ve never seen. This reflection is not bound by the distractions of the world I know; it is calm, grounded, eyes clear and bright with curiosity rather than restless hunger. I kneel at the pool’s edge, reaching out to touch the surface, and as my fingers graze the liquid, ripples spread outward, each wave carrying away fragments of my compulsive need to check, to know, to be anywhere but here.

The ripples transform into images—moments of presence I’ve missed in my waking life. I see myself laughing with friends, untouched by the urge to capture the moment for a post. I see quiet mornings spent watching the sunrise, free from the pull of a screen. I see my own hands crafting, creating, living—untethered. Each ripple washes over me, filling the hollow spaces inside with a warmth I didn’t know I’d been missing.

I rise from the pool, feeling lighter than air, and notice that the crystalline forest around me is changing. The trees are melting, not into water, but into streams of glowing energy that flow toward me, wrapping around my body like a cocoon of light. I don’t resist; I let it envelop me, and as it does, I feel my mind clearing, my thoughts no longer darting like frightened birds but settling like leaves on a still pond. I am here. I am now.

The dream begins to fade, the amethyst sky dissolving into a soft, velvety darkness, but I carry with me the sensation of that presence, that unshackled freedom. As the last echoes of the crystalline forest’s song linger in my ears, I know—I will remember this. I will bring this back with me, a reminder that I can break the pattern, that I can choose to be fully, vibrantly here, even when I wake. And as the dream releases its hold, I feel the mossy ground beneath me turn to the familiar texture of my bed, the hum of the dream-world giving way to the quiet of my room, but the warmth, the clarity, stays with me, glowing faintly in my chest like a tiny, unbreakable ember.
