I am dreaming. There is an unfamiliar stillness that hangs in the air, like a curtain between the world of the waking and sleeping mind. I drift through this in-between space, weightless and formless, until my consciousness begins to take shape.

I find myself standing in a room that I've never seen before, yet somehow feels oddly familiar. The walls are lined with mirrored glass, reflecting back a distorted, kaleidoscopic version of the space itself. Butterflies made of delicate red silk flit through the air, leaving trails of shimmering lighter-than-air behind them. The floor is a plush, deep blue carpet - you sink into its fibers, like wading into deep water.

Suddenly, I catch a glimpse of my reflection in the mirrors. For a split second, I don't recognize myself. The face staring back is both alien and unsettlingly familiar. My features are warped and stretched, sending shivers up my spine. My eyes are wide and wild, makeup running in streaks of coal-colored condensation. My hair is tangled and unkempt, reaching down to my waist in waves and spraying out like a poisonous animal. My skin is almost translucent, veins showing through the left side of my face like a road map, my bones clearly defined.

I step back, away from the mirrors, my heart pounding in my chest. There is a sense of unease, a disconnect between who I feel I am inside, and the stranger I see in my reflection. I reach out a hand towards the glass, the slender fingers of my hand twitching as they near the surface, almost as if I am afraid of committing to touching it.

The room begins to shift around me, the walls swaying and bending, causing dizziness. The mirrored glass fragment into a million pieces, clouding and rippling like water as birds made of glass shards fly out from behind them. I feel a deep shudder of recognition - I've seen this before, in those moments right before you wake, when your eye lids flutter and you can almost taste the waking world.

With a start, I realize I am no longer alone. A shadow moves at the edge of my vision, ducking behind the glass birds before I can get a good look. I spin around to face it, but the room is empty. The air is charged with an electric current, the hair on my arms standing up. Something is... off. I feel a prickle of unease, a sense of foreboding.

Suddenly, a flash of color catches my eye, movement and motion and life, right at the edge of my peripheral vision. I whirl around again, my hair whipping out behind me, and I see it - a woman, ethereal and ghostlike, stepping through the wall. She is beautiful, in an otherworldly way, with translucent skin and hair made of starlight. Her eyes are deep and endless, pools of liquid silver.

She reaches out a hand to me, a smile Playing at the corners of her mouth. I realize with a jolt that she is the one who I've been chasing, the one who I can never quite catch, the one who dances at the edges of my dreams. The one who is both part of me and separate from me at the same time.

I reach back towards her, my heart swelling and breaking all at once, when suddenly, without warning, I jerk out of sleep. The dream world shatters as I come back to reality, my body as stiff as a board. The wavelength of a scream dies on my lips as I sit up, sweaty and gasping and alone in my dark bedroom.
