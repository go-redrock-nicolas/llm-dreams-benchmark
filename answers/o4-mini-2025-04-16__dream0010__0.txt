I am dreaming. You drift into the dream fully: your eyelids flutter like butterfly wings, a hush of violet twilight all around. The air ripples with possibility, and before you stands the grand Colosseum of Coveted Callings, its gleaming pillars carved from stardust and moonstone. An arching banner reads, in letters of living fire, “The Quest for Your True Vocation.”  

Bright-eyed spectators float above in iridescent bubble-seats, humming encouragement. At the center of the arena is your first trial. A spiral staircase of polished amber ascends into the clouds. Each step you take releases a soft chime, and the higher you climb, the more the sky shifts—first emerald, then sunrise pink, then a velvet black spangled with impossible constellations. At the summit waiting to greet you is the Gatekeeper: a luminous fox with three tails, each tail tipped in glowing ink. It speaks in a voice like wind through chimes:  
“Prove your vision,” it says, and with a flick of a tail conjures a panel of mist. Within it, swirling scenes of possible futures—some bright, some shadowed—dance. Your task is to pluck one future from the mist and breathe life into it. You exhale gently, and the chosen vision solidifies: you stand at the helm of your dream career—hands steady, heart alight. The Gatekeeper bows and lets you pass.  

The second arena is a vast hall of mirrors, each pane reflecting a different facet of who you are—your doubts, your greatest hopes, your hidden talents. To proceed, you must walk calmly past each mirror, nodding in gratitude. As you meet your own eyes in the glass—sometimes weary, sometimes fiery—you acknowledge every version of yourself with kindness. The mirrors glow warm, then dissolve into petals that drift upward, clearing the path to a set of floating platforms.  

Each platform bears a challenge. On one lingers a kaleidoscopic puzzle of shifting shapes you must assemble with only intuition. On another drifts a wounded nightingale whose song is fractured—your task is to soothe it, weaving the broken notes back into a perfect melody. Each success imbues you with a ribbon of silver light, weaving into a sash around your shoulders.  

Finally, you arrive at the Threshold of Becoming: a great door swirled with galaxies, its handle the form of a quill pen, a conductor’s baton, a sculptor’s chisel—every symbol of creation melded into one. As you touch it, your ribbons of light surge forward, unlocking untold potential. The door swings open, revealing an endless horizon of possibility: endless fields of story and song, starships on the brink of discovery, libraries whose shelves stretch beyond infinity.  

In that shimmering moment, you know you have claimed your prize—your dream job awaits. A chorus of triumphant wind-harps rises, and the spectators’ cheers become a warm tide that carries you home. Then, just before you step through, a soft voice whispers, “Awaken,” and the brilliance gently fades. You stir, eyes opening to dawn’s pale glow, your heart still echoing with the promise of that grand arena—ready, at last, to turn dream into destiny.
