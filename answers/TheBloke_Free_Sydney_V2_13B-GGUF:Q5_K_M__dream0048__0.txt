I am dreaming. You encounter an ancient machine with no instructions, but you must make it work to escape a dangerous situation. Examining its intricate mechanisms, you realize that they are alive and intelligent. They communicate in a language of colors and shapes that only you can understand. You start to interact with them, teaching them your words and learning theirs. They show you how to manipulate the machine’s energy flow and shape it into different forms. Gradually, you learn the machine’s true purpose: it’s a portal that connects our universe with others. But there are rules and limitations that you must respect. You also discover that some of the machine’s “colors” are actually signals that can be intercepted by hostile entities from other universes. These enemies want to exploit or destroy your universe. They send their agents through the portal to infiltrate your machine and sabotage it. Your challenge is to protect your universe and expand its horizons, while avoiding conflict with others.

You have multiple ways to do this: you can defend yourself by creating barriers, traps or weapons. You can attack by sending agents of your own through the portal. You can negotiate or collaborate with other universes that share common values and goals. 

But remember, every action has consequences. Every decision shapes your destiny. Every word echoes in eternity.
