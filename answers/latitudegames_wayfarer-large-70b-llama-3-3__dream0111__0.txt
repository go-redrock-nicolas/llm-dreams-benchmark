I am dreaming. A wave of icy terror surges through my veins as I stand frozen in the sterile operating room, transfixed by the glinting steel scalpel in my unsteady hands. Before me lies a person whose life hangs precariously in the balance - their chest rising and falling with shallow, labored breaths beneath a thin blue surgical sheet.
