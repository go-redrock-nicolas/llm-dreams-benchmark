I am dreaming. You're walking through a dense, misty forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. The trees are ancient and gnarled, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers, beckoning you deeper into the woods. You press on, your heart pounding, knowing that somewhere ahead, there is someone you care about dearly.

As you emerge into a clearing, you see them. They're standing at the edge of a precipice, a sheer cliff dropping dangerously down to a raging river far below. The water churns and froths, the spray soaking the air around you as you approach. 

Your loved one turns to you, their eyes wild and unfocused. "It's okay," they say, their voice raspy and distant. "This is what I need to do. It's the only way." They make a few steps closer to the edge, their movements jerky and erratic.

A sense of cold dread washes over you. You reach out, maintaining your distance, trying to keep your voice steady and calm. "Please," you say, "don't take another step. Let's talk about this. I'm worried about you. I care about you so much."

They whirl round to face you, their face contorted with frustration. "No! You don't understand! No one does! I have to do this!" Their voice rises to a shout, echoing off the towering cliffs surrounding the clearing.

You take a deep breath, trying to keep the fear out of your voice. "What I understand is that I love you. And I'm terrified I'm going to lose you. Please, let me help you. Let me love you."

For a moment, it seems like they might listen. Their expression softens, the tension draining from their shoulders. But then their eyes harden again, and they turn back towards the edge. "I can't. I'm sorry. Goodbye." They step forward, poised to leap off into the maw of the ravenous river below.

You don't hesitate. You charge forward, a primal scream tearing from your throat as you try to tackle them out of the way. Time seems to slow. It's like moving through thick syrup as you lunge out, your arms straining to reach them.

Just as your fingers brush against their shirt, they duck out of your grasp and twist around to face you, an almond straining to see them clearer. "You can't save me," they whisper. "I don't want to be saved. I'm sorry." They turn back to the edge, and in a single swift motion, they step off the cliff.

You scream, stumbling forward, your hands scrabbling for purchase as you try to catch them. But you're too late. You watch in horror as they plummet down, down, down, their scream fading to nothing as they disappear from view, swallowed by the merciless waters of the river below.

You collapse to your knees on the edge of the cliff, tears streaming down your face, a wordless howl of anguish tearing from your throat. You're too late. You couldn't save them. And now, you may never see them again.

You awake with a start, your heart pounding, your body drenched in sweat. The dream was so vivid, so visceral, that it feels as if you're still standing there at the edge of the precipice, watching your beloved disappear into the darkness below. It's a moment that will haunt you for a long time to come.
