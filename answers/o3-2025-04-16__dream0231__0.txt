I am dreaming. I am dreaming…

I stand on the threshold of an impossible landscape—an ocean that has forgotten its water and now ripples with silver sand. Above me the sky is violet glass, streaked with slow-moving constellations that rearrange themselves like letters looking for a sentence. I feel weightless, as though some gentle giant hand has plucked out my every worry and let it drift away like dandelion seeds.

Ahead, two monoliths rise from the gleaming dunes.

The first monolith is squat, obsidian, inset with a shallow niche. Inside the niche rests a single luminescent coin, no bigger than a button. It hums. Tiny sparks leap from its surface, each spark carrying the scent of fresh-baked bread and the echo of a spontaneous laugh—those little comforts that fit perfectly into the now. I know, somehow, that if I pluck the coin the hum will surge into a melody, and I’ll wake with a modest sum in my bank account by morning. Immediate relief. A warm cup of cocoa on a cold night.

The second monolith is slender and translucent, its heart pulsing with slow golden light. When I place my hand upon it, the stone becomes a window, revealing a grove that exists months down the river of time—lush trees whose leaves are embossed with currency symbols, whose roots sparkle like quartz. From a single low branch dangles a fruit the size of my heartbeat. A voice like distant thunder says: “Wait. Tend the seedling of patience. In several cycles of the moon, the fruit will be yours, and its sweetness will outlast seasons.” I feel the promise: a sum large enough to reshape my future—student-loan shackles snapped, restless travel dreams granted wings, maybe even that tiny studio with the skylight where inspiration can roost.

I glance down and notice my footprints materializing and evaporating in the sand, as if even my indecision cannot leave a lasting mark here. A breeze carries the voices of people I love—my sister joking about rent, my friend sighing over medical bills, my own quieter fear of unforeseen emergencies. The immediate coin hums louder, a siren of security.

I inhale, tasting ozone mixed with cinnamon. Then I look up. The constellations overhead rearrange into an hourglass that pours stars instead of sand. Time is passing whether I clutch the small or cultivate the great.

I kneel, scoop a fistful of the silver sand, and sprinkle it on my open palm. The grains rearrange themselves into tiny diagrams—compound interest curves, calendars flipping pages, my face relaxing years from now because debt has melted away. The vision is vibrant, but it shivers with risk: storms I cannot yet see, expenses I cannot predict.

“Choose,” the monoliths breathe in unison.

I close my eyes, press my palm to my chest, and listen—not to the hums, not to the thunder, but to the steady drum of my own need. Yes, the world outside this dream holds rent deadlines, groceries, and that car repair that can’t be delayed much longer. Yet I feel a stronger tug from a place deeper than anxiety, a place where hope hoards its brightest embers.

I rise, walk to the slender, translucent monolith, and plant my fingerprints upon its cool surface. The golden light floods me, not as currency yet, but as conviction. In response, the squat monolith’s coin flickers once—like a candle resigned to dawn—then dims. I turn back and see that it’s not gone; it has transformed into a shimmering seed that buries itself in the silvery dune, promising that even forfeited immediacy can germinate into something unexpected.

Above, the hourglass of stars flips itself, granting me the months I need.

I wake with empty pockets but a full horizon inside my chest.
