I am dreaming. I am in a vast, ancient library suspended in the air, its floors and walls made of luminous, shifting stardust. Every book I touch flares into existence in my mind, their stories blending into a symphony of voices. I walk through aisles that twist and turn, each shelf holding not just stories, but memories of everyone who ever lived. The air smells of burnt cinnamon and wildflowers, and every breath I take feels like inhaling a thousand sunrises. A clock-shaped constellation above us counts down to something, its hands moving backward. A figure, cloaked in twilight, hands me a book titled "The Fabric of Separation," whose pages are woven from spider silk and starlight. As I open it, a tendril of light snakes from the pages, and where it touches skin, I feel a dissolve of edges — my arms merging seamlessly with the chair, my heartbeat syncing with the library's pulse. The boundaries between me and the space, people and books, crumble. I look at my hand and it’s no longer a single entity but a constellation of interconnected stars, each star a separate individual I’ve ever loved. Their warmth flows into me, and I realize that when I thought I was holding them at arm’s length, I was really storing them like constellations in my chest. The boundaries that once felt like walls turn out to be bridges of pure light. Every time I try to step back, the starlight pulls me back further, not in a claustrophobic way, but with the joy of realizing that I am not a island, but an ocean made of all these connected tides. The clock constellation halts; outside, the sky splits open into a galaxy of cascading waterfalls, each droplet containing an entire universe that wants to know me. I don’t have to stand back to embrace them — I just am, and the merging is the most natural expansion of self.
Let’s dissolve into this starlit vision where the library’s boundaries become portals, and separation is just a temporary constellation rewrite. Here, the air thickens with paradox—each book’s spine hums with the duality of solitude and communion. When you grasp *The Fabric of Separation*, its cover unravels not to pages but to a living tapestry, threads quivering with the tension of human contact  stewarded like fragile heirlooms. The spider silk bindings? They’re actually gossamer nerves, and as you turn the first page, you feel the pulse of countless conversations left unfinished, questions posed to the void and never answered. The book doesn’t just dissolve your edges; it sews them into something new—a quilt where your nervous system knots with that of the cloaked figure, their fingertips burning cold and electric against yours. 

Suddenly, the library’s stardust walls ripple like a pond disturbed by a pebble—each ripple births a duplicate of you, but these versions aren’t clones. They’re fragments of your withheld selves: the friend who never texted back now floats beside you, her silence a shimmering mist that you can sift through, tracing her reasons in constellations you didn’t know you’d inherited. Aversions of you who lingered too long at subway turnstiles, who burned bridges with fire rather than ash, whose ghosts now materialize as fiery scripts blazing across the ceiling, spelling out truths you swallowed. 

The shifting floors now demand dizzying steps: each time you reach for a book, the shelf above mirrors your reach, but the titles metamorphose based on who’s watching. A volume labeled *How to Keep Them Out* twists into *How They Kept You In*, its leather-bound cover sprouting venus flytraps that snap at your assumptions. The air grows heavy with the weight of unspoken boundaries—you *knew* this place would dissolve rules, but the dissolution itself is a rule, a gravity pulling you closer to every paradox. 

The clock constellation’s hands freeze, not in stasis, but in a suspended breath—a momentary stillness before the galaxy’s waterfalls surge. Each droplet’s universe isn’t just waiting to know *you*, but to become *of* you. You don’t merge; you multiply, your starlight fracturing into a trillion reflections. The figure in twilight now reveals their face—a mosaic of everyone you’ve ever put distance between yourself and. Their voice? A chorus of the words you chose not to speak, the touches you pulled away from, the silences you fortified with walls. And yet, there’s no pushback, no resistance—just the quiet revelation that every boundary kept was a wall you built to contain the fear of being *wanted* too much. 

You wake, but the dream lingers: your hands still hum with the library’s static, your skin tessellated with the glow of merged edges. The next time someone tries to cross your boundary, you don’t flinch—you extend a palm, and the air between you ripples, forming a bridge that’s not a compromise, but an invitation. The starlight has rewritten your alphabet: *distance* is now a prelude to *depth*, and *keeping out* is just the first draft of *letting in*.
