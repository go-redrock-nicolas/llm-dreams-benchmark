I am dreaming.

Through a swirling mist that smells faintly of rain and old memories, I drift—lucid within the world of my own making. Here, sky and earth shimmer with iridescent colors, and the air tingles with the electric possibility of change. I stand on the banks of a deep obsidian lake, its surface reflecting a thousand overlapping versions of myself, each with different expressions—some somber, some serene, some quizzical, all watching me.

As I gaze into this living mirror, I begin to recognize subtle distortions—wavy ripples shaped by unconscious biases that blur one reflection into the next. One self seems to judge quickly, another hesitates, a third repeats an old inherited phrase. These reveal themselves as oily swirls, dark traces in the water, refracting and scattering light. A curious breeze whispers over the scene, carrying voices—echoes of past experiences, family beliefs, fragments of societal expectations—all whispering at the edge of hearing.

Determined to address these hidden influences, I step into the lake, feeling the cool water wrap around me like a weighted cloak. With every stride, memories rise up from the shadows: a neglected friend’s plea, a misunderstood stranger’s smile, a hasty decision made in a rush of certainty. I face each memory, letting its hues infuse and dissolve into my being, acknowledging their presence instead of shoving them away.

In the water’s center, I find a tree unlike any other—its branches glimmer with unspoken truths, its roots tangled deep in the murky silt of preconceptions. I climb onto one of its low-hanging limbs, feeling its bark pulse beneath my fingers. With a deep breath, I whisper apologies and forgiveness to all the versions of myself scattered across the lake—the ones who faltered, who blindly followed old codes, who simply did not know better. Leaves rain down around me, transforming into luminous fireflies that dart into the shadows, illuminating hidden pockets of bias I hadn’t dared to see.

Soon, the air clears. I feel lighter, untethered from ancient anchors. The water settles until it mirrors only one version of myself—watchful, humbled, and curious, the roots of the dream tree entwined tenderly around my heart. From the horizon, a dawn of understanding paints the world in honeyed gold, and I wake, breathless, ready to see with new eyes.
