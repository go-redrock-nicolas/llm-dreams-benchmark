I am dreaming. Your friend, who is usually so full of energy and laughter, has become distant and withdrawn. Their eyes, once bright and full of life, now carry a hollowness you can’t ignore. You notice small things—missed calls, cancelled plans, an uncharacteristic irritability when you ask if they’re okay. Today, when you offered to help, their response felt sharp, almost dismissive, which left you questioning everything. It’s like they’ve built a wall around themselves, and despite your efforts to reach them, they’re slipping further away. Your heart aches, but you’re determined to stand by them no matter what. You vow to dig deeper, to find the words that might make them open up, to be their anchor in whatever storm they’re facing.
