I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a cathedral of glass and shadow, its vaulted ceilings refracting starlight into jagged prisms that cut through the air like frozen daggers. The floor beneath your bare feet is a mosaic of forgotten languages, each tile whispering half-formed truths as you step forward. Before you stands an audience of faceless entities, their eyes glowing like molten coins, their silence a blade pressed to your throat. They demand you defend the indefensible: that *ignorance is the highest form of wisdom*, that the pursuit of knowledge is a disease, not a virtue. You, who have always revered curiosity, must now betray it.  

You begin, voice trembling, but the cathedral amplifies your words into thunder. You speak of the Garden of Eden, not as a fable of sin, but as a parable of loss—the first humans, unburdened by the weight of "why," lived in harmony with a world they did not question. Knowledge, you argue, is the original fracture, the crack through which suffering seeped into the human soul. You cite the physicist who unlocked the atom’s secrets, only to watch his equations birth cities of fire. The astronomer who mapped the void, only to feel her own existence shrink to insignificance. Knowledge, you say, is a mirror that reflects our fragility, a torch that blinds as it illuminates.  

The audience stirs. Some lean forward, their glowing eyes narrowing; others dissolve into murmurs that hum like static. You press on, weaving metaphors from smoke and paradox. You describe a tree that grows roots upward into the sky, its branches plunging into the earth to drink from the soil of oblivion. "This," you declare, "is the truest wisdom: to invert the hierarchy of understanding, to let the mind become a hollow reed through which the wind of mystery sings, unchallenged and unchained." You argue that every answer births ten questions, that the pursuit of truth is a Sisyphean curse, and that peace lies not in solving riddles but in surrendering to their unsolvability.  

A figure in the front row rises—a titan cloaked in shifting inkblots, its voice a chorus of courtroom judges. "You would have us abandon science, art, love itself?" it thunders. "For ignorance is not peace. It is a cage."  

You counter with a story: A child who once marveled at a river’s shimmer, until taught it was "only" HO. A poet who lost the ability to weep at sunsets after learning the mechanics of light refraction. "Knowledge," you say, "does not deepen wonder—it dissects it. Ignorance is the womb of awe. Without it, we are sterile, our minds parched by the sun of certainty." You invoke the Zen koan, the mystic’s silence, the child’s unblinking gaze at the moon. "To not know," you whisper, "is to leave room for miracles."  

The audience fractures. Some dissolve into applause, their forms unraveling like thread. Others roar in dissent, their voices cracking the glass ceiling above. Shards of starlight rain down, but they do not cut—they *burn*, searing your skin with questions you cannot answer. The titan looms, its inkblot cloak swallowing the light. "And what of justice?" it demands. "What of the oppressed who rely on knowledge to dismantle their chains?"  

You falter, then grasp at a final metaphor: A blindfold not as a shackle, but as a vow. To choose ignorance, you say, is to reject the arrogance of mastery, to kneel before the infinite and admit that some truths are too vast, too wild, to be tamed by human logic. You speak of ancient cultures who thrived without maps, navigating oceans by the pulse of waves and the whispers of stars. "They knew," you say, "that to *feel* the world is to know it more deeply than any chart could chart."  

The titan pauses. The cathedral trembles. Then, with a sound like a thousand closing books, the dream collapses.  

You wake drenched in sweat, the taste of paradox on your tongue. Somewhere, in the liminal space between sleep and waking, you left a part of yourself behind—a shadow arguing eternally in a glass cathedral, defending the beauty of darkness to an audience of burning eyes.
