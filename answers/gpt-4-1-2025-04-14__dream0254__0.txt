I am dreaming. I am swimming through a world stitched together by moonbeams and the scent of petrichor. Here, colors move like living things, humming softly; the air itself feels heavy with possibility. Even gravity seems optional—a gentle persuasion rather than an absolute law.

I find myself inside an ancient greenhouse, glass walls breathing silver light. Lush ferns and midnight-colored roses brush my arms as I search for something unnamed. Between the tangled roots, my close friend appears, their features wavering as though seen through water—eyes brimming, hands clutched tight to their chest. 

Suddenly, the calm fractures. They collapse to their knees among the violets, every petal shivering with the force of their confession. With trembling words, they reveal a truth—a devastating secret, rippling out through our very memory. My trust was the currency they could never afford. "I wasn't who you thought," they whisper, tears sparkling like tiny worlds themselves.

A wind catches in the rafters as I kneel beside them, the space bending between remorse and forgiveness. Their pain is a tangible thing—an obsidian mirror pressed between our hearts. The greenhouse warps, glass fracturing with each of their sobs, kaleidoscoping our reflections across the misty panes.

I reach out and wrap my arms around them, feeling their sorrow sink into my bones, heavy and electric. The air fills with the keening of unseen birds, vines winding and unwinding, mirroring the tangled, secret histories we share. I want to assure them, but my voice is a handful of moths fluttering uselessly in my throat. 

Yet in this dream-world, understanding passes wordlessly; forgiveness drips like honey from the broken glass above, dappling us with sticky gold light. Something shifts—a weight lifts, a cage door opens. The secret lingers, but its power wanes, as if daylight is burning away the fog around us.

Together, we look up. Even as the greenhouse crumbles, a strange new garden grows from the ruins—the possibility of trust, raw and green and tender, unfurling at our feet. And outside, dawn stains the world with hope, promising that even the most tangled secrets can be transformed, in the fertile soil of dreams, into bright new beginnings.
