I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of wet clay and starlight. You wake—not in your bed, but in a studio suspended between dimensions, its walls woven from threads of twilight. A canvas floats before you, impossibly vast, its edges dissolving into mist. In your hand materializes a paintbrush forged from the spine of a comet, its bristles shimmering like liquid obsidian. You dip it into a palette that isn’t there, yet overflows with colors that have no names—hues that ache with the memory of forgotten constellations and the taste of unspoken words.  

The first stroke is a rebellion.  

A single line of molten gold arcs across the void, and time fractures. The studio shudders; clocks bloom from the walls like mechanical flowers, their hands spinning backward, forward, sideways. You paint a circle—a sun, a pupil, a portal—and step through it. Suddenly, you’re in a meadow where the grass sings in harmonic scales, each blade a violin string plucked by the wind. A river nearby flows upward, carrying salmon with wings of stained glass, their scales refracting memories: your childhood, a stranger’s wedding, the extinction of dodos, all swirling like ink in water.  

You paint a door.  

It’s oak, ancient and gnarled, with a handle of frozen moonlight. When you open it, a library unfolds—a labyrinth of floating books whose pages are alive. Each tome whispers its story as you pass: a pirate’s confession written in seawater, a queen’s diary inked in her own blood, a child’s doodle that giggles and reshapes itself into dragons. You pocket a page that smells of cinnamon and regret, and it burns into your skin like a tattoo.  

But the brush hungers.  

You paint a window. Beyond it, galaxies knead themselves into being, nebulae birthing stars in slow-motion supernovae. A blue smear becomes a bridge—a Bifröst of cerulean and silver—that stretches to a mountain peak where time pools like rainwater. You walk it, each step echoing a thousand years. At the summit, a tree grows with rings visible through its bark, each layer a different epoch: dinosaurs grazing beneath it, knights dueling, astronauts planting flags on its roots. You pluck a fruit—a glowing orb—and bite into it. The taste is nostalgia and prophecy fused, a symphony of *what was* and *what might be*.  

Then, the chaos.  

The canvas rebels. Your creations begin to unravel, colliding in a kaleidoscope of paradox. The singing meadow floods the library; the comet-brush trembles, its power too vast. You realize: this is not just art. It’s alchemy. You’re not painting scenes—you’re stitching realities, weaving the sinews of existence. A misstep could erase a century, birth a black hole, or unwrite a lover’s first kiss.  

You pause.  

The brush hovers, trembling like a hummingbird’s heartbeat. You choose a new color—ochre, the shade of campfires and ancient secrets—and paint a loom. Its threads are made of light and shadow, each strand a life, a choice, a breath. You begin to weave, not to create, but to *mend*. A tear in the fabric of a widow’s grief, a frayed edge where a war began, a hole in a child’s forgotten laughter. The loom hums in gratitude, and the universe leans closer, listening.  

When you finally drop the brush, the studio returns. The canvas is gone. But your hands are stained with stardust, and the scent of the singing grass lingers in your nostrils. You wake in your bed, the echo of a thousand lifetimes in your bones. On your wall hangs a painting you don’t remember making: a door, a window, a tree, and a loom, all tangled in a single, impossible stroke.  

And the brush? It’s under your pillow, still warm.
