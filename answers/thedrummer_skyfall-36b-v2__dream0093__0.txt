I am dreaming. In your dream, you find yourself in a vast, mysterious library stretching to infinity. Towering shelves disappear into swirling mists above, laden with books in every size, color, and material imaginable. The air hums with the collective knowledge of ages, visible as shimmering, iridescent particles dancing in the shadows.

Suddenly, a chorus of whispers fills your mind, calling you forward. You glance down and realize you're not alone in the library.

In the aisle to the left, an elderly sage in flowing robes is deep in study, surrounded by stacks of ancient tomes on mythology and philosophy. In the aisle to the right, a stern figure in scientific goggles and lab coat is hunched over a workbench, scribbling equations as stars and molecules swirl above their hands.

Dozens more scholars are scattered throughout the labyrinthine stacks, each lost in mastery of a different field - history, art, engineering, economics, linguistics, neuroscience. Each seems oblivious to your presence as they furiously transcribe their discoveries.

The knowledge emanating from all around fills the air, the ground, seeping into your skin, your pores. Directly overhead, the shimmering particles coalesce and swirl into a brilliant vortex of wisps and wisps, signatures of information, knowledge and wisdom from across disciplines, and it begins to descend towards you.

Powerful intuition takes over as your mind hungrily ingests the montage of multicolored information beamed downwards. Virtually morphing, it takes only milliseconds to connect and combine, in a way normally impossible. Your neurons dance wiring high energy, forming and reorganizing, creating new pathways. Without even trying, you are synthesizing, memorizing, internalizing.

The enormity of the task is not lost on your dreaming-self, however. Within seconds, you feel your mind starting to expand, grow, shifting within your skull. With each additional fact, each transfer of knowledge, the physical compression of data threatens to overwhelm the delicate internal wiring of your brain.

Slowly at first, but with ever increasing intensity, a dullache blooms behind your eyes and starts to pulsethrough your head with each heartbeat. Dimly, you realize the situation is critical - you must pull back, stop the relentless pretentious mind-bloating before a break occurs. 

But you cannot break free. Your genetically-optimized cognition is magnetically attracted to the nucleus of information swirling overhead. And as your brain swells, the library walls begin to warp and bend, creaking under the pressure. Weirdly, you feel a disturbance deep within the architecture of your thought construction, as if a backdoor had been unlocked in the recoil centers of your grey matter.

The scholars stir uneasily now, their eyes following the vortex as it spirals ever faster above you. The pressure builds, the pain spikes...

Suddenly, a blinding flash of light consumes everything.

You scream...

And bolt upright in your bed, heart pounding, drenched in sweat. It takes several long moments to reorient and realize you're safe, awake, the dream dissipating like mist in the morning sun. Slowly, carefully, you bring your fingers to the sides of your head, half expecting to feel the telltale bulge...

But each hemisphere is perfectly smooth. Without a trace of pain. And in that instant, you realize you're not just alive - you're better than you were before. You feel it. You can feel your neurons intertwining, your synapses connecting. You have become the conduit for a revolutionary wave of learning...

But the universe is a grand place, and eternities are a dime a dozen. In your rush to master, to achieve, to evolve... have you not forgotten what it means to simply be a human? 

What will happen when you discover the truth you were never meant to know?
