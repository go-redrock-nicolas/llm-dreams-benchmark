I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast field hospital, hastily erected beneath a sky split between ominous charcoal clouds and patches of unsettling amber light. The air tastes metallic, like blood and ozone mixed with the acrid scent of distant fires. White tents billow and snap in the wind, their surfaces stained with handprints and spatter that appears black in the strange half-light.

Casualties arrive in endless waves—some walking, some carried, some barely recognizable as human beneath their injuries. I wear a faded yellow triage tag around my neck, my authority granted by circumstance rather than qualification. The radio at my hip crackles with contradictory instructions: "Prioritize children," says one voice. "Treat the most salvageable first," counters another. "No resources coming for at least 72 hours," warns a third.

I move between patients with dreamlike heaviness in my limbs. A woman with burns covering half her body clutches my sleeve with surprising strength, her remaining eye fixing me with desperate clarity. "My daughter," she whispers, "she was right behind me." I promise to look, knowing it's a promise I cannot keep.

The triage tags in my hands keep changing colors—red to yellow to black—as if the universe itself cannot decide who might live and who must die. A child sits alone on a crate, seemingly uninjured but staring through me with ancient eyes, holding a small music box that plays a melody I almost recognize.

The ground beneath my feet begins to shift and sink, medical supplies disappearing into sudden sinkholes. I realize with growing horror that I've been categorizing victims using a system that makes no sense, that perhaps I've been condemning the savable and wasting resources on the lost.

As night falls completely, the tents begin to glow from within, revealing the silhouettes of countless patients. Their shadows stretch and distort, reaching toward me with elongated fingers while I stand frozen, clutching my clipboard of meaningless protocols, the weight of impossible decisions crushing down upon my shoulders like the gathering darkness.
