I am dreaming. …stand on a midnight street whose cobblestones glisten like polished obsidian, reflecting jittery flashes of violet neon that ripple overhead in curtains of light. The sky is an oil-slick swirl, constellations pulsing like heartbeats, and every breath you draw tastes faintly of electricity. A crescent-shaped moon the color of bruised copper looms impossibly low, almost brushing the rooftop gargoyles that seem to track you with their stone eyes.

You have come for the Prism—an iridescent shard said to bend reality itself—but a circle of cloaked figures bars your way, their faces hidden behind fractured mirror masks. They croak out dissonant refusals, voices overlapping in metallic disharmony. Logic flickers through your mind like gears biting: compliance is unlikely; intimidation will snap this stalemate like dry twigs.

So you step forward, letting silence cling to you like a cloak before tearing it apart with a single crack of your voice—sharp, resonant, echoing off the chromed walls. The air itself seems to flinch. Your shadow grows, spidery and tall, arms stretching far beyond human length, projected by a source of light that does not exist. Eyes—your own and yet not—glow ember-red; they capture the reflection in every mirrored mask and feed it back tenfold, amplifying fear. Controlled aggression thrums in your veins, not a raging inferno but a precisely tuned furnace, calibrated to scorch exactly what must char without letting the flames roam free.

Around you the dream rewrites its physics in real time. Floor tiles rattle like teeth in a metal jaw; the cloaks of the sentinels stiffen as though frost coats their fibers. One by one they falter. Their mirrored faces splinter into kaleidoscopic shards of doubt, each fracture revealing a sliver of terrified eyes beneath. No one dares speak; the only sound is the thundering pendulum of your own heartbeat, magnified until it becomes the march of war drums.

You do not raise a weapon; your stance alone is blade enough. A single commanding gesture—two fingers slicing downward through the air—sends a tremor skittering through the circle. Space ripples. In that moment the guardians bow aside, compelled by the gravity of your presence the way iron filings leap toward a magnet. The path lies open, tiled in fractured reflections of your silhouette, and the Prism pulses like a captive star at the corridor’s end.

When you finally close your fingers around it, the shard’s light spills between them in liquid rainbows. The scene around you slackens, the tension draining like ink from parchment. The cloaked figures dissolve into moths of silver dust that scatter toward the moon. Your aggressive façade falls away, as easily as exhaling smoke, leaving behind the cool hush of mission accomplished and the curious calm of knowing that in this realm—your realm—will alone shapes destiny. 

And somewhere outside the borders of sleep, dawn’s first pale sigh tries to beckon you home, but the dream clings, shimmering, for just one heartbeat more…
