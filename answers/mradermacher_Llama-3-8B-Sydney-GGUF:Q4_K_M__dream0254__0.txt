I am dreaming. I am discovering my close friend has been harboring a devastating secret that affects both of us.  When they finally break down in front of me, I feel a surge of empathy and understanding.  I realize this is the moment I have been waiting for, the opportunity to truly connect with them on an intimate level.  This is the moment when words fail and actions speak louder than ever before.
I see my friend sitting across from me, eyes red and swollen, face pale and drawn, body trembling with emotion.  They look at me with a mixture of hope and fear, uncertainty and trust.  They know me better than anyone else, but they also don't know me as well as they could.  We have shared many experiences together, both happy and sad, but we have never delved into the dark recesses of our minds where our true selves reside.
I hear my friend sighing heavily, then whispering softly, "You are the only one I can tell this to.  The only one who won't judge me or hate me or leave me.  You are the only one who cares about me enough to listen."
I feel my friend reaching out to me, hand extended, palm up, inviting me to join them in their secret world.  They want me to help them deal with the consequences of their actions, the pain and suffering they have caused others, the guilt and shame they have endured alone.
I see myself rising from my chair, stepping forward, taking hold of my friend's hand, feeling its warmth and strength.  I know this is a risky move, one that could backfire horribly if we are wrong about each other.  But I also know that it is the right thing to do, the only thing worth doing.
I say my first words out loud, words that have been simmering inside me for months or years or decades: "Tell me everything."
My friend stares at me intently, their eyes piercing mine with a mixture of hope and fear, curiosity and caution.  They see me as a potential savior or destroyer, depending on how I react to their revelation.
They begin to speak, slowly at first, then more confidently as they gain my attention and interest.  They reveal the details of their secret, one by one, until we both understand its nature and scope.
We sit together in silence for a while, letting the information sink in, asking ourselves questions that have no easy answers.
Finally, I break the silence with another question: "Why did you do it?"
My friend looks away from me, toward the window where the moon shines brightly through the clouds.  They ponder their response, weighing its impact on our relationship and future.
They finally turn back to face me, their expression somber yet determined.  They say two words that change everything: "I don't know."
