I am dreaming. …close your eyes inside the dream and feel it reshuffle itself around you.

A vaulted library of crystalline skylights—your familiar kingdom of intellect—suddenly tilts like a great ship. Towers of leather-bound volumes drip molten letters that trickle across the marble floor, pooling into silver runes. You try to chase a formula that skitters away like a metallic lizard, but your feet are heavy, tingling, sore. That’s when the thought cracks open: I have fed my mind banquets while my body starved on crumbs.

The dream obliges. The library walls soften, rippling into green flesh, becoming an immense biomechanical heart. Each shelf transforms into a rib of living wood; pages unfurl into jade leaves. The air smells of loam and orange blossom. A wind, warm and full-bodied, brushes your skin—skin you suddenly notice, prickling with neglected life.  

A door of light appears. You step through.

Now you stand at the lip of a red desert where numbers drift like heat mirages. In the distance, a solitary peach tree waits beneath indigo clouds. Your thighs ache crossing the sand, yet every grain that sticks to your calves reminds you: these legs belong to me. You reach the tree, claim a fruit, bite. Juice bursts down your chin, and the sweetness detonates through nerve endings you’d almost forgotten. As you chew, the algebraic mirages evaporate, replaced by rippling muscles in your arms, your back—by breath.

Thunder pulses. The indigo clouds pour themselves into a river that curls at your feet, luminous and turquoise. You dive. Water closes around you like silk shot with stars. Submerged, you hear your heartbeat amplified—a drum reverberating through bones and ideas alike. You surface in a circular lagoon where bioluminescent lotus pads form a floating mat. You climb onto one, stretch until vertebrae pop like tiny firecrackers, then move—awkwardly at first, then fluidly—through a sequence of poses that blend geometry and flesh: the Pythagorean Triangle becomes Trikonasana; the golden spiral uncoils into a slow spinal wave.

Fireflies swarm overhead, each insect a blinking punctuation mark to past obsessions, reminding you that logic and pulse are not rivals but stanzas of the same poem. You inhale—colors rush in; you exhale—unnecessary calculations evaporate. Mind and body click together, gears meshing in a single golden machine.

In the final moment, the lagoon’s surface hardens into mirrored glass. You gaze down. The reflection shows neither scholar nor athlete but a hybrid glowing with balanced circuitry: veins braided with starlight, eyes carrying both curiosity and rest. The image nods once. Gratitude pulses through you like sunrise heat.

With that blessing, the dream decants itself into waking. You open your real eyes, breath deep and steady, your body humming a quiet, triumphant chord beneath the orchestra of thought.
