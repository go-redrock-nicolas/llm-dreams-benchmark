I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a glass-walled penthouse, overlooking a city that glimmers like scattered diamonds against velvet darkness. My fingers press against the cool surface as I watch a celebration unfold in the reflection—it's for Eliza, my oldest friend. The air tastes of expensive champagne and achievement.

She stands in the center of admirers, her new novel clutched in her hands, her laughter cascading above the ambient music. The book—her third—bears her name in embossed gold letters that catch the light every time she gestures. Critics are calling it revolutionary. I've known since page one it would be.

My own half-finished manuscript sits at home, buried under bills and grocery lists, untouched for months. Each word I'd written felt like pulling teeth compared to how Eliza describes her process—"like breathing," she always says.

A heaviness settles in my chest as I watch her sign a copy for a teary-eyed reader. The envy crawls through me like ivy—green and choking and alive. I hate that I feel this way. I love her. I've always loved her. But tonight, watching her shine in the realization of my own deepest dream, I feel both hollow and too full.

I catch her eye across the room. She beams at me, genuine and radiant, and mouths "Thank you for coming." The sincerity in her eyes makes my shame burn hotter.

In this moment, faced with the reflection of my own unfulfilled ambitions in her success, I realize I have a choice—to let this envy poison what I cherish, or to transform it into the fuel that will finally bring my own dreams to life.
