I am dreaming. I am in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as I move deeper into the maze I am overwhelmed by a feeling of terror. The walls around me are covered in strange symbols and patterns, and the maze seems to be shifting and changing as I move through it. 

The walls are both oppressive and magnetic, drawing me deeper and deeper into the maze. I try to turn back, but the maze seems to be shrinking around me, blocking my path. Panic begins to set in, and I begin to run through the maze, trying to find a way out. 

But no matter how fast I run, the walls never seem to change. The symbols on the walls begin to glow brighter and brighter, and I feel a strange energy radiating from them. It's as if the maze itself is alive, and it's pulling me deeper and deeper into its grasp. 

The walls begin to close in around me, and suddenly I'm trapped. The air is thick and heavy with a strange, metallic smell. My heart races as I try to escape, but it's no use. The maze has won. 

Suddenly, a gust of wind blows through the maze, and I find myself transported to a new location. The brightness of the sky is overwhelming, and I can feel a strange energy pulsing through my veins. In that moment, I know that something terrible is going to happen. 

And then, I wake up.
