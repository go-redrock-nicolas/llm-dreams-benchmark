I am dreaming. The world around me pulses softly, not with light, but with something else—whispers of forgotten songs, perhaps?  Colors bleed differently here, like watercolor left out in the rain, swirling into new shades without names.  The air hums, thick with the scent of crushed dandelions and burning sugar.  

A crack runs through the concrete beneath my bare feet.  Tiny mushrooms sprout along its jagged edges, bioluminescent caps pulsing a slow, sleepy rhythm—blue, then green, then violet—as if breathing in time with my own heartbeat.  I crouch down, the warmth of the pavement seeping into my skin, and press my palm to the fracture.  The mushrooms sway toward me, their glow brightening like shy fireflies greeting an old friend.  

Then, I see it.  

A single ant, iridescent as oil on water, drags a petal twice its size from a crumpled cigarette butt.  The discarded paper unfurls in stop-motion bursts—now a rose, now a moth, now a tattered flag of some vanished kingdom.  The ant pauses, antennae flickering, and for a moment, its many-faceted eyes reflect not the alley around us, but a vast, star-drenched desert where silver dunes sigh and shift like living things.  

A raindrop splashes against my wrist.  When I look up, the sky is a mosaic of broken mirrors, each shard reflecting a different season—snowfall in one, cherry blossoms in another.  The rain tastes like laughter and copper, salt and honey, and I realize the drops are not falling *down* but *sideways*, as though gravity has forgotten its purpose.  They hover midair, trembling with the weight of unshed memories.  

Something brushes my shoulder—a tendril of ivy dripping from a rusted fire escape.  Its leaves are tiny hands, velvet-soft, stitching seams of gold thread into the fabric of the dusk.  One leaf curls around my finger, and a voice too large for the alleyway murmurs in my ear: *"You are the dreamer, and the dream. The story, and the teller."*  

Then—silence.  

The mushrooms dim.  The ant bows, petal-crown glinting, and vanishes into the cigarette butt, which sighs and settles into the shape of a fallen star.  The crack in the pavement seals itself with a sound like vertebrae snapping back into place.  

Above, the mirrored sky splinters.  

I wake.
