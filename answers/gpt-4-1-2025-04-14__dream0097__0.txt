I am dreaming. …move as if time itself has slowed to a crawl. While the world erupts in pandemonium—a stadium full of people frozen mid-scream, flares of color and movement suspended in the fractured air—I feel an uncanny stillness within my chest.

The disaster begins as a low tremor beneath my feet, rumbling through the concrete, sending ripples through discarded soda cups and flickering the electronic billboards overhead. Suddenly, an immense, ear-splitting boom shreds the atmosphere, and a shockwave bellows through the packed arena. People surge in every direction, a tide of fear, their faces twisted in confusion and terror.

But for me, everything is different—like moving through honeyed air. The screams and chaos slow to a muted hum, each movement drawn out, every bead of sweat on a runner’s temple glimmering like a tiny crystal suspended in light. I step between two colliding bodies, gently redirecting their panicked path. I see, in the gaps between heartbeats, shoes flying off a child as she’s lifted by the press of the mass; her panic is almost palpable, eyes wide and searching.

I reach her with ease, the world’s panic parted before me. I pluck her from the ground, her hair floating in slow motion around her face, and lift her out of harm’s way. I spot a toppled barricade ready to crush a group cowering underneath—my hands, guided by urgency and an impossible serenity, right the heavy metal just before it falls, as if the world is obedient to my will.

Each step reveals ripple after ripple of calamity: a man clutching his chest in the crush, a woman ensnared by the straps of her purse, people stumbling, gasping for help. Yet to me, there is no confusion, no haste—there is only clarity and the soft, unhurried drum of my own heartbeat.

I weave between the frightened, shimmering crowd, gently guiding, rescuing, untangling. My perception is heightened; colors are more vivid, sound comes as a muffled echo, and the heavy scent of sweat and ozone hangs thick in the still air. I can anticipate dangers before they unfold. A falling light rig pauses mid-plunge, and I usher a cluster of people aside, their fear stretched across time like amber, malleable and slow.

Above, the sky roils with smoke and sparks—the disaster takes on an almost mythical shape. Yet I move, unhurried, through the chaos. Somewhere in the depths of my dreaming mind, I sense my own fear transformed into purpose—an uncanny power flowing through me from some ancient place.

And for a fleeting moment, as I look over the trembling city, I understand: I am a gentle force amid destruction, a silent guardian moving in the spaces between moments.

Then, as the scene begins to blur and fade, I awaken, heart pounding with the aftermath of impossible heroics, the echoes of tragedy and hope mingling in the yawning dawn.
