I am dreaming. The dream starts in an empty void, devoid of any shape and form. Suddenly a bright white light blinds me for a second and my dream transforms into a fantastical, picturesque scene. It was as if I was living in a 4D animated movie, with surrealistic colors and textures one can only witness in this dream universe.

I find myself standing on a soft tuft of lime green grass, vibrant and emanating a sweet fragrance that fills the air around me. The sky is a whimsical mix of lavender and light blue hues, with clouds painted in pastel shades of pink and yellow. The sun, a gigantic dahlia in the sky, exudes a warm, comforting light. The landscape carves into a gently rolling valley that stretches far and wide, filled with blossoming floral carpets and majestic, glistening water bodies.

As I stroll through this enchanting paradise, I feel a tinge of melancholy. I recognize this place. It's my secret haven where my old friends and I would escape to during our shared dreams. Dreaming together was our unique superpower, a testament to our strong bond. But lately, as our lives paths diverged, these shared dreams grew fewer, and the once unbreakable bond seem to be fading away.

In the distance, I see familiar figures standing with their backs towards me. My old friends! I hasten my pace, desperate to catch up, but the more I try, the further they seem. The disheartening reality of our social drift dawns upon me. Each figure begins to ascend into the dream sky, tethered to the ground by shimmery strings that represent our fraying connections. As they soar higher, the strings stretch and thin out, some snapping and floating away in the gentle breeze.

Suddenly, a brilliant idea strikes me. Using the remnants of my waning superpower, I start to manipulate the dream, transforming it into a fantastical fairground, brimming with exciting rides, games, and food stalls. The air fills with the melodious laughter of my friends and me, reigniting our shared memories.

My friends, drawn to the nostalgia, began to descend, their strings gradually thickening and strengthening. As they touch down, we race towards each other, the distance between us closing rapidly. We share warm hugs, smiles, and laughter, the magic of our shared dream world rekindling the bond we once thought was lost. Our social drift is momentarily forgotten, as the dream fills with love, joy, and a renewed sense of companionship.

In the midst of the vivid revelry, the whimsical dream starts to fade away as faint rings of an alarm infiltrate the dream. The fantastical fairground begins to dismantle, the vibrant colors lose their vivacity, and the very fabric of the dream world disintegrates into stardust. As the alarm grows louder, I am jolted awake from the fantastical dream, the vivid images still painted in my mind's eye and a smile lingering upon my lips.

Even in the deepest parts of my imagination, my yearning for the strong friendship I once had wound its way into this vivid dream. Despite the drifting apart, the memories would always remain, awaiting patiently in the deepest part of my mind, ready to be revisited in dreams.
