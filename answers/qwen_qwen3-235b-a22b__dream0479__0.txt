I am dreaming. I'm dreaming and I know it.

One moment, I'm standing at the edge of a collective chaos: a seemingly endless field of people, all pushing and pulling against something unseen, the air vibrating with shared frustration. I see them pulling at the fibers of the sky, trying to bend a relentless world to their will. I feel that familiar tug in my chest, the instinct to struggle, to fight against the current of what is.

And then a whisper, barely audible in the clamor. *"Let go."*

It's not loud or stern, just weighty in a way that makes sense deeper than words. I turn and see no one, but the whisper echoes in my bones.

I do it. I stop resisting. The moment my breath unfurls and I surrender to what is, the world around me begins to unravel. Or maybe it’s not unraveling, but transforming. The sky ripples like water suddenly set alive, shifting from gray grit to a deep, opalescent blue, streaked with stripes of silken comet dust. The chaotic voices fade, their frustration melting away like fog in the morning sun. I can breathe again.

And I look down and see that I am walking—not on ground anymore, but on steps of light suspended over an infinite ocean made of glass. Each footstep leaves a ripple of color—auroras breathing into life. Each color echoes a feeling: green for serenity, amber for knowledge, deep violet for ancient mystery and the quiet truth of belonging.

A whale made of stars swims just beneath the glass ocean, its surface embedded with galaxies, constellations shifting as if remembering forgotten lullabies. It breaches soundlessly through the celestial sea, its body slowly morphing into a spiral staircase as it leaps. I step toward it, following, floating, with no effort at all, and no fear.

Dream-me is unafraid. Dream-me is lit from within.

As I climb the staircase formed from the star-whale’s body, I notice glimmers surrounding me—others, too, are climbing, though they weren’t here before. They wear robes woven from memory, each one different: feathers, autumn leaves, snowflakes, ink. Time no longer moves in a line here—it folds, whirling like paper caught in the wind. Friends I haven’t spoken to in years appear, young again, radiant and laughing, no explanation needed. Lost loved ones pass cups filled with honeyed moonlight, and as I sip, I don’t taste bitterness—I taste peace.

Then a voice, or a feeling that becomes a voice, warm and resonant like spring melting winter’s edge: *"You made space by letting go. The world becomes what it was meant to be when you do not resist the truth of it. Even uncertainty has its songs."*

In front of me grows a city—not built of stone or steel, but of luminescent emotion. Towers formed of forgiveness rise like cathedrals; streets made of laughter curve gently like the flow of stories passed through generations. Children of all ages fly overhead with laughter ringing like bells; their capes stitched from dreams acknowledged, not denied.

And I understand.

This is the gift of surrender—not defeat, but creation. Not giving up, but opening the door to what might come if I stop forcing the window shut.

The dream spirals inward now, drawing me toward its heart.

There, at the center, there’s a mirror made of fireflies. I hover before it. It doesn’t reflect my face—it reveals the shimmer of every possibility I ever dared not imagine. In its glow I see not who I was, nor who I fear I’ll never be—but a thousand selves, all sitting beneath the same tree, branches full of futures untouched—

And I wake, not gasping, but smiling.

Because, for the first time, the dream didn’t try to hide the truth—

It whispered it.

Then waited for me to listen.
