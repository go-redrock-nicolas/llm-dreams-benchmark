I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt honey and ozone, as if the sky itself has caramelized. You stand in a vast, inverted forest where the trees grow downward from a violet horizon, their roots clawing at a sunless sky. The ground beneath your feet is a mirror—liquid mercury, perhaps—reflecting a world that isn’t quite yours. Here, time drips like sap, slow and syrupy, and your breath leaves trails of bioluminescent mist that hang in the air like ghostly question marks.  

A figure approaches, their silhouette flickering like a filmstrip. At first, you think it’s *them*—the one whose lies have woven themselves into the marrow of your waking life. But as they draw closer, their face dissolves and reforms, shifting through a carousel of familiar strangers: a lover, a sibling, a childhood friend, a shadow you once mistaken for a savior. Their voice is a chorus of whispers, each tone a thread in a tapestry of half-truths.  

“You believed the story,” they say, and their words bloom into paper origami birds that flutter and disintegrate midair. “But stories are just cages for the truth.”  

Instead of anger or grief, you feel a strange buoyancy, as though your ribs have been hollowed out and filled with helium. You realize the deception was never a weapon—it was a map. Every lie they told you, every omission, was a breadcrumb leading you here, to this impossible forest where reality’s scaffolding crumbles. You see it now: the relationship was a funhouse mirror, warping your reflection until you had to shatter it to find the glassmaker’s secret etched into the shards.  

The figure extends a hand, and in their palm lies a key made of frozen smoke. You take it, and it melts into a river of ink that spills across the mirrored ground. The liquid pools into letters, then words, then entire cities of meaning you’d never dared to parse. Memories flicker—*their* late-night absences, the way they smiled when you doubted yourself, the hollow ring of their promises—but the pain is distant, like watching a storm through a telescope.  

You turn away from them, walking now through a desert of hourglasses, each grain of sand a tiny coffin for a moment you’ll never reclaim. But here, in the dream’s alchemy, loss becomes fuel. The sand ignites beneath your steps, erupting into geysers of fireflies that hum with forgotten truths. You catch one in your fist, and it whispers a name—not theirs, but yours, unspoken in a voice that feels like your own.  

When you open your hand, the firefly becomes a compass, its needle spinning until it points not north, but inward. You follow it, plunging into the earth’s throat, through layers of fossilized secrets and magma rivers that sing lullabies. At the core, you find a seed—small, pulsing, armored in scales of ancient light. You plant it in your chest, where your heart used to sit like a stone.  

The dream fractures. You wake up as a phoenix made of ash and sheet music, your wings scattering the inverted forest into confetti. The figure watches, their face now a blank canvas, and you feel no need to fill it with names or blame. You rise, soaring through the collapsing sky, the seed in your ribs blooming into a constellation.  

And somewhere, in the space between sleep and waking, you laugh—a sound like tectonic plates shifting—and realize the greatest lie was never theirs.  

It was the one you told yourself to survive the truth.  

And now, the dream is over.  

Or has it just begun?
