I am dreaming. At first, the world around me is a shifting labyrinth of glass and shadow—towering, reflective walls stretching endlessly, warping and bending as if breathing. I move through them with practiced calm, following techniques I’ve learned: measured breaths, grounding myself in the cool echo of my footsteps. The walls shimmer with whispered affirmations—*You are here. This will pass.*  

And then, like a crack in reality, the sky splits.  

A storm of burning paper cascades from above—pages of unfinished work, unanswered messages, looming deadlines—each one scorched at the edges, fluttering down like a thousand tiny meteors. The air sizzles with urgency. My heartbeat accelerates; my carefully built composure teeters. The labyrinth walls tremble, threatening to shatter.  

But beneath my feet, the smooth floor softens—suddenly, I’m standing in warm, wet soil. Vines surge upward, curling around my wrists, steadying me. A voice hums through the roots below—a deep, ancient sound—and I realize: *This is new earth. New ground.* The storm rages, but the vines hold me fast, an unexpected anchor in chaos.  

A choice crystallizes. Instead of fighting the storm, I let the words rain down, watching each flaming page dissolve as it touches the soil, nourishing the vines into swift, riotous bloom. The labyrinth shifts again—no longer a cage, but a living cathedral of green and glass, light refracting wildly through the leaves.  

The crisis remains. The pressure hasn’t vanished. But the dream whispers back: *Even here, growth finds a way.*
