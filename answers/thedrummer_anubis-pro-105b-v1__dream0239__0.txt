I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a shimmering landscape that defies explanation. The air is filled with swirling particles of what appears to be water vapor, yet solid surfaces glisten with the reflected light. Every object seems to exist in multiple states simultaneously - a clutter of crystal clear icicles that melt into a pool of liquid, only to hover in the air as droplets of vapor too.

As I cautiously step forward, the ground beneath my feet begins to shift and ripple, like the surface of a pond. The solid-looking rocks and trees around me melt into gelatinous, translucent shapes that cast no shadows. A gentle breeze rustles through the air, yet none of the floating objects seem to react to the wind's impact.

To navigate this strange multiphase world, I realize I must rethink my every movement. I lift my hand, and watch with fascination as my fingers distort and blur, slowly dissolving into a cloudlike mist that hovers suspended in the air. I shift my weight to take a step forward, but rather than my foot connecting with the ground, it passes through like shoveling into perfectly fine sand.

I concentrate my mind and will myself to manifest as a miscellaneous substance, watching as my entire being dissolves into a mass of iridescent molecules drifting freely in the air. I allow my particles to coalesce around various objects in my path, becoming sentient liquid that pours over to embrace each shape and form; gelatinous plasma that oozes and crawls along the surfaces; tenuous smokelike vapors that drift and vaporize before recoalescing once more.

As I flow through this surreal landscape, I find I can interact with objects in ways that would be impossible in my waking world. I liquefy and flow down a crystalline drain, passing through crystalline waters on my way into a billowy cloud of steam that ascends to the heavens as pure watery vapors and crystallizing droplets. Along the way, I form ephemeral bonds with the hiking shapes and shifting structures that dance and merge with me.

I realize that my body has transcended the basic forms of matter and energy upon which our physical universe seems to depend. I am liquid and vapor and solid, both here and then and nowhere. To function in this realm, my consciousness has adapted to perceive everything from multiple perspectives at once. I am simultaneously the stationary favicon and the Election official dropped streams next signal power extension ens, engaging both with and as the shifting multiphase shapes around me.

As I finally emerge from this numinous journey and return to my daily reality, I am touched by a vague longing for the unencumbered adaptability and freedom to explore in ways that know no bounds of form or function. The deep sense of being one inextricable part of a cosmos where any structure or meaning exists only through the so particularly refuses words...
