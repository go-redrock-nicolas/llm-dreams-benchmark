I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of wet earth and crushed mint, a post-rain aroma that seems to charge my senses.  I walk along a path that shimmers like liquid mercury, each step causing ripples to spread behind me.  Above, the sky is a canvas of impossible purples and golds, as though the sun and moon are warring over dominance.  To my left, a forest of crystalline trees hums a low-frequency song, their prismatic leaves refracting light into kaleidoscopic patterns that dance on the ground.  To my right, a river flows backwards, its water clear but dense as honey, and within it I see reflections of faces I don't recognize but feel an uncanny familiarity with—ancestors perhaps, or fragmented versions of myself.  The compulsion to create claws at my ribs, an almost painful urge.  I reach down and scoop up a handful of the river's liquid gold, letting it trickle through my fingers.  Where the droplets fall, they solidify into tiny, perfect sculptures: a dragon with ivy for scales, a weeping woman spun from starlight, a cube dissolving into butterflies.  My hands glow faintly, the skin mottled like polished stone.  I realize I am wearing a tunic the color of oxidized copper, its threads adorned with symbols that shift and rearrange themselves like living text.  A voice without origin speaks in my mind—**"The river is memory.  The path is becoming.  Create."**  

I follow the path further, the forest's song growing louder, the colors more intense.  My breath hitched as I realize the sculptures I’ve created are multiplying, their forms warping and perfecting themselves autonomously.  The dragon is now riding a comet through an imaginary sky; the weeping woman has stopped crying and is now stitching a quilt from nebulae; the cube-butterflies hover around me, transmitting emotions I can’t name.  I reach for a jagged obsidian rock beside the path and touch it to the river.  Suddenly, the rock dissolves into a symphony—notes flow from it like liquid, merging with the forest’s hum.  

**"You are the creator here,"** the voice reminds me.  

Bolder now, I cup my hands and gather more of the river’s light, shaping it instinctively.  My first attempts are crude: a lopsided bird, a faceless dancer.  But as I concentrate, they refine themselves, self-correcting.  The path beneath my feet erupts into blooming flowers that rise like rockets, exploding into fireworks of pollen.  A creature with too many eyes and too few legs bows before me, offering a feather that pulses with inner light.  

 uncertaintly,** why can’t anyone else see this? Is this all just... me?**

The voice answers: **"This is the realm of unformed potential.  You are both visitor and architect."**

A cathedral of mirrors comes into view ahead, its spires twisting into impossible angles, reflecting not my image but scenes of futures lived and unlived.  Inside, apprentices made of smoke wait at easels and looms, their unfinished forms bristling with the static of latency.  They look to me with question marks for eyes.  

I choose a loom, weaving threads of fire and shadow.  The patterns I invent twist into three dimensions, moving.  Each thread a story waiting to be told.  

**"This is your crucible,"** murmurs the voice.  **"Here, your unwrought talent learns to breathe."**

The backward-flowing river now arcs into the sky, raining a glittering dew that etches itself into art on my skin.  I press my palm to a tree; it blossoms into a doorway.  Beyond it: a marketplace of dreams, where thought is currency and impossible crafts are bartered.  I trade a handful of my starlight tears for a chisel forged in stardust, and carve a sonnet into the bark of a tree made of sound.  

The world begins to dissolve at the edges, the colors bleeding like watercolors in rain.  The voice warns: **"The waking is near.  What will you carry back?"**

I clutch the chisel to my chest, feel the glyphs on my tunic sear into my skin.  The last image is of the mirrored cathedral’s doors dissolving into a blank canvas, waiting.  

I awake, the copper-tune symbols lingering on my fingers, my mind alight with a score yet to be performed, a story that insists on being told.
