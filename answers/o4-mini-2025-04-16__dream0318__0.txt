I am dreaming. As these compulsive deceptions multiply and intertwine, you feel the floor beneath you soften—no longer a solid plane but a living tapestry of every untruth you’ve ever spun. Each fib blooms into a translucent blossom of color, pollen drifting through the humid night air. You reach out and brush a petal with your fingertips; it dissolves like smoke, whispering fragments of conversations you never had, places you never visited, people who only exist in your own inventing.

Suddenly the room stretches into a vast hall of fractured mirrors. In each pane, a different version of yourself stares back: one wearing a crown of fallen leaves, another perched on a marble pedestal, a third with endless staircases spiraling out from behind its eyes. Whenever you speak, the echoes in the mirrors contradict one another, so your own voice comes back to you as a chorus of half-truths, apologies you never made, boasts you never dared to utter.

Above you, the ceiling jets open like a giant iris, revealing a sky that bleeds liquid silver. The petals at your feet spiral upward, forming a helix of blossoms that lifts you into the air. You drift between nebulae of whispered lies—each stardust mote a fiction you once told to cover a deeper secret. They glitter like diamonds, but with every flash you feel a tug in your chest, as though the universe itself is weighing your honesty against your self-invented mythology.

Then, without warning, the reflections converge into one colossal image: your own face, stretched across the horizon, speaking in a gravelly tone you’ve never heard before. “Why do you lie?” it booms. Its eyes crack open, revealing twin galaxies swirling with doubt. You try to answer, but your words tumble out as more stories—an elaborate rescue mission in a burning library, a midnight voyage beneath seas of molten glass—none of them real.

The colossal you laughs, and the sound is both terrifying and oddly comforting. The mirrors shatter, raining you down into a pool of ink-black water. You sink slowly, each lie dissolving into ripples that carry you deeper into calm. Silence envelops you. In the darkness, a single truth remains: you are the weaver of your own dream, free to invent and free to reveal. As you drift toward the surface, the last thing you sense is the gentle pulse of your own heartbeat, guiding you back—back to a reality where truth and fiction dance, forever inseparable.
