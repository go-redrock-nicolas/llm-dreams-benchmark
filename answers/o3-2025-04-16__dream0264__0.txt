I am dreaming. …pause mid-fall, as though the gravity inside the dream has been switched off. The roar of rushing wind dies to a hush, and a kaleidoscope of half-remembered memories freezes around you like shards of stained glass suspended in mid-air. 

There it is again—the old thought spiral that usually drags you down the same tired rabbit hole: I’m not ready… I’ll never get it right… Why start if failure is certain? The phrases hang like neon signs in the darkness, flickering with each heartbeat. In waking life, you’ve followed this loop so many times it has carved canyon-deep ruts in your mind. But tonight you are dreaming, and in dreams the rules bend.

You reach out and physically pinch the glowing words between your thumb and forefinger. They feel brittle, like thin sugar glass. The letters crack and crumble, spilling a glittering powder that sprinkles onto your skin. Where the dust touches you, you feel warmth—an electric fizz of possibility.  

You glance around for something sturdier to build with. Through a chink in the floating glass shards, you spot an immense door made of polished obsidian. Etched upon its surface is a single brass phrase that pulses with its own heartbeat:

CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY.

The command hums through your chest. You drift toward the door, still weightless, still free of the downward tug. As your hand meets the cold stone, you sense the choice point—the pivot where habit once yanked you sideways. Instead of bracing for failure, you inhale a memory of every time you surprised yourself with success. You remember the triumphant taste of finishing, the giddy laughter of starting again. These memories weave a lattice around you, stitching a luminous cloak of conviction.

The obsidian door swings open—not outward, not inward, but like a page sliding in two directions at once. Beyond it lies a balcony overlooking an ocean made of stars. The waves shimmer in amethyst and indigo, cresting against moon-white sand. A gentle wind carries the scent of night-blooming jasmine and salt. Far off on the horizon, constellations rearrange themselves, spelling your name in celestial cursive.

“Step forward,” whispers the wind, “and let the sky rewrite your story.”

You do. Your feet, bare and glowing, land on the cool marble of the balcony. Above you, meteor-like fish arc through the star-water, flinging silver droplets that freeze into tiny bells and chime as they fall. Each chime sounds like a promise kept. 

In this place—this middle distance between thought and reality—you begin to experiment. You tug threads of nebulae into ropes and braid them into bridges that span glittering gulfs. You pluck a full moon from its orbit and tuck it into the pocket of your robe; it becomes a lantern that never dims. Every action here, freed from the old loop, writes a new synaptic path. You can feel it etching itself in living circuitry across your dream-brain, mapping hope where once only dead-ends existed.

A sense of exhilaration replaces the fear of past errors. You laugh—an honest, belly-deep sound that flutters the horizon like a sail catching wind. The universe laughs back, a basso echo rumbling through the sand-made-of-starlight shore.

At the cusp of waking, you gather all these sensations—the bells, the jasmine salt air, the metallic hum of CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY—and compress them into a single radiant marble. As the dream begins to fade, you tuck the marble under your tongue like a secret seed.

Morning light flickers against your eyelids. You awaken with its taste still alive inside you: bright, cool, and daringly sweet. And when the old thoughts try to reassert themselves, you roll that invisible marble across your teeth. It glows. It reminds you—softly, firmly—that gravity can be a choice, and spiral paths can be redrawn into constellations.
