I am dreaming. You find yourself walking through an old, mystical library. The scent of ancient parchment and leather binds fills your nostrils as you run your fingers along the spines of countless books, their titles written in languages you've never seen before. Your heart pounds, a fusion of fear and curiosity, as you make your way deeper into the labyrinthine stacks.

Suddenly, a figure materializes from the shadows. It's you. Your doppelgänger, with eyes that pierce right through you, regarded with no hint of judgement.

"Let me show you something," your dream-self says, reaching out to take your hand.

You hesitate, fighting the urge to resist. You've been discriminating yourself from these sorts of dreams before, pushing away any constructive criticism from your 'self' without a second thought.

But, there's something different in the air. A stillness. Tranquillity. 

With a gentle squeeze of your hand, your doppelgänger urges you to follow them deeper into the library stacks.

As you walk, the shelves morph and twist, the books changing form as you pass. Titles you recognize - books you've read in your waking life, moments that have shaped you - float by, glowing softly. But as you look closer, cracks appear in their spines, their pages tattered and torn.

"You've cut yourself off from the very wisdom you need to grow," your doppelgänger says, his voice a soothing murmur. "You've let fear of failure, of being wrong, of being proven flawed, act as a barrier."

The shelves shudder and reform, spilling out illustrations. A harsh scolding teacher, a parent's disappointed glare, a friend's hurt expressions as you overreact. Faces from your waking life, moments of criticism that sent you spiraling inward.

"I know it's not easy. I know you fear that if you open yourself to growth, the last remaining carapace that protects you might crumble away. But that carapace does you no good. You need to let go."

The illustrations disintegrate into dust. Your doppelgänger guides your hands to a book, the cover blank. It opens, and you see yourself, surrounded by so many approving, proud faces. Friends, family, colleagues, lifting you up.

"You have the power to discard that carapace. To invite criticism, to take it in, process it, grow, and beam with the radiance of your knowledge and experience."

Suddenly, you're aware of a soft breeze, the whisper of impossibly small wings. Hundreds, thousands of what look like tiny fairies, each one with a book in their hands, drift from the shadows. They're urging you to take the books, to let them fill you with knowledge. 

With a deep breath, you allow yourself to reach out.

As your dream-self smiles, your doppelgänger merging with your true self, you realize that growth isn't about becoming a new person. It's about the short, small moments of opening yourself up, and letting wisdom permeate to your very core and bake itself into your being.

When you wake, you feel a strange peace. And Wisdom still breathes through you. 

The End
