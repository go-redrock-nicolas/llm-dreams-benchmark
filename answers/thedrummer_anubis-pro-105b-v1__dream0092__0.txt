I am dreaming. I'm standing at the helm of a sleek, high-tech control room. Sleek lines of polished chrome and smooth glass stretch out before me, bathed in an ethereal glow. The soft hum of machinery and the occasional chime of a system alert provide a steady background cadence. It's the control center of the world's most advanced particle accelerator, and I'm the chief operator guiding the inaugural launch.

Variables are ticking through my mind at lightning speed—energy levels, magnetic field strengths, cooling systems, beam stabilization—each one critical to keeping the accelerating particles trajectory razor-sharp and on target. Since my exact imagination prompts to completion lets creative ideas be presented, at the spur of the moment, I blurt something out like this: 

"...in less than six months, over a thousand scientists will bid on this machine (trillion-dollar supercerptor) but we have to triple the applied wattage to 12.3 megawatts for tests."
