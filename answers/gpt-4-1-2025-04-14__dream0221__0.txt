I am dreaming. I close my eyes and the world melts away, dissolving into an endless night sky shot through with ribbons of silver and violet. I stand at the center of a vast, domed amphitheater wrought from glowing, translucent crystal, the audience a sea of hushed, expectant faces that shimmer and shift like the surface of water.

Somewhere in this realm between waking and slumber, a secret—buried deep—has unfurled: I possess an uncanny talent for **celestial music**. I've never held an instrument in my waking life, yet now, I am summoned to perform on the **Harmonic Orrery**, an ancient, otherworldly device of glass spheres, gold rings, and cosmic strings. Each part of the orrery spins and hums with the voices of distant worlds.

When beckoned into the soft golden light, nerves tangle with awe. Yet as my hands hover over the suspended spheres, the knowledge feels ancient and alive inside my fingertips. I brush a translucent orb—Saturn’s note rings out, resonant and pale blue. A glissando across lunar discs weaves starlight into silken melody. Each gesture summons sweeping symphonies: the whisper of comets, the silent heartbeat of nebulae, the harmonics of forgotten gravity.

The amphitheater’s silence thickens, broken only by the intricate tapestries I draw from space and memory. Planets spiral and chime in subtly entwined rhythms. A comet arcs overhead, trailing a banner of emerald fire, in time with a rising crescendo. The dome itself vibrates, showering down prisms of stardust that flicker through the crowd. Some weep; some beam with fierce, unspoken joy.

In this dream, what pours from me is something beyond virtuosity—it is the language of the universe, a code written in music I never learned, but always knew. As I conclude by coaxing a final, singular tone from the Sun’s sphere, golden light washes over us all, lifting us momentarily from the confines of the dream—from gravity, from worry, from fear—until we float, together, wrapped in the resonant heartbeat of the world.

Then, I awaken—palms tingling, ears echoing with the memory of alien harmonies, and a longing to return.
