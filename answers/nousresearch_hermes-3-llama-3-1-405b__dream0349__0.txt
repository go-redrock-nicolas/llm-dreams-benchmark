I am dreaming. I am in a great banquet hall filled with all sorts of people.  They are wearing clothes from all cultures and walks of life.  I am sitting at a long, ornate table surrounded by faces I know and love.  I am wearing ceremonial robes of brilliant white, with gold trim and a regal purple sash draped across my chest.  I feel proud and honored to be here.

Suddenly, a trumpet fanfare rings out.  The chatter dies down, and all eyes turn to the front of the room.  A herald steps forward and calls out, "My lords and ladies, I present to you, [Your Name], Champion of Dreams!"

I am confused.  Did I do something that deserves such a title?  The crowd stands up and cheers for me as I walk to the front of the room.  A regal-looking man in a crown and ermine-trimmed cape greets me, and behind him stands a woman in a flowing dress of shimmering moonlight.  They smile at me warmly.

The king speaks, his voice deep and resonant.  "My dear [Your Name], we have been watching you.  Your ability to see the beauty and potential in all you encounter is unparalleled.  You have touched so many lives, and inspired us to be better versions of ourselves.  We honor you tonight as our Champion of Dreams.  May your insight never dim, and may you continue to bring light to the darkest corners of our hearts."

He hands me a small crystal orb that seems to glow with an inner light.  The queen leans forward and embraces me, whispering, "Thank you, dear heart.  You give us all hope."

I am overwhelmed.  Validation and approval wash over me like warm sunshine.  I never knew my small actions could have such an impact.  I return to my seat in a daze, clutching the crystal orb to my chest.  As I sit down, I see the faces of my loved ones beaming at me, full of love and pride.

As the banquet continues, I am surrounded by people, each with a story to tell about how my words or actions touched their lives.  An elderly woman tells me how I inspired her to paint again.  A young man recounts how I convinced him not to give up on his dreams.  A stoic warrior's eyes fill with tears as he tells me how I helped him to forgive himself.  I am humbled and amazed.  

The feast is magnificent, full of every delicacy imaginable.  The atmosphere is electric with joy and celebration.  Music and laughter fill the air.  As I look around the room, I realize that this moment in time is special.  We are all connected in the present, basking in the glow of love and appreciation.  I tuck this feeling away in my heart, to be cherished and remembered in my darkest hours.

My dream ends as the night fades into dawn.  The last thing I remember is the queen's ethereal voice in my ear, whispering, "Always remember, dear heart.  You are loved."
