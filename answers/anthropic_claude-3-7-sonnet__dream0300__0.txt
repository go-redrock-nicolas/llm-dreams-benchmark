I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a massive sinkhole that wasn't there yesterday, a perfect circle cut into the earth as if by some cosmic cookie cutter. The air smells of petrichor and something else—something ancient. My heart hammers against my ribs as I peer over the edge. The stone walls descend in spiraling patterns, glowing with faint bioluminescent fungi in blues and purples that pulse like heartbeats.

People around me take photos or gawk from a safe distance, but I feel an inexplicable pull. A makeshift rope ladder dangles down, tied to a nearby oak tree. A handwritten sign reads: "Descent at own risk. What waits below awaits only the brave."

My palms sweat as I grab the first rung. The reasonable part of my mind screams warnings, but the thrill of discovery drowns it out. As I begin to climb down, the voices above grow distant. The rope sways dangerously with each movement, and loose stones tumble into darkness below, never making a sound when they land.

Halfway down, the walls begin to whisper—not in words, but in sensations, memories that aren't mine. My muscles tremble from exertion and fear, but something magnificent awaits below—I know it with inexplicable certainty. The fungi glow brighter as I descend, illuminating ancient carvings that seem to move when I look away.

I'm terrified, exhilarated, alive in a way I've never been, climbing down into Earth's secrets with nothing but my racing heart to guide me...
