I am dreaming. The room is cold, sterile, hums with the quiet pulse of machines, their screens casting a pale glow over my hands—my efficient, unwavering hands. I do not know what the machines do, only that their function is vital, and that I must adjust their levers, dials, and inputs with exacting care. A single error could unravel something vast, something I cannot name but *feel* in the weight of the air.  

At first, it is easy. The process is a rhythm—check, calibrate, verify. But then, the variables shift. A dial trembles on its own. The numbers on the screens flicker into nonsense. A slow panic slithers up my spine, though my hands remain steady—must remain steady.  

The walls are breathing. Or perhaps it is the machines, their metal skins expanding and contracting like living things. A whisper slips between the cracks, a voice not formed by tongue or teeth but by the spaces between atoms: *"You were never in control."*  

A red light pulses—wrong, wrong, wrong—but when I reach to correct it, my fingers pass through the controls as if they are made of smoke. The floor tilts. The air warps. And then—  

Silence.  

The machines are gone. The room is infinite, and I am standing at the edge of... something. A vast, starless dark, where shadows move just beyond perception. They are watching. They have always been watching. And now, they step forward—not with feet, not with form, but with the certainty of a thing that was there long before me, and will remain long after.  

*"You thought you were the keeper,"* the dark murmurs. *"But you were always the subject."*  

And then—  

I wake. Sweating. Intact. But with the gnawing sense that somewhere, in some other place, the red light is still blinking. And no one is there to turn it off.
