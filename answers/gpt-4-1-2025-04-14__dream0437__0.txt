I am dreaming. …I am dreaming.

The boundaries of the dream dissolve like watercolor in rain. Around me, a metropolis blossoms under a sky stitched with threads of violet and gold. Every building hums with slow, living light—a city constructed from music itself, adorned with balconies of parchment and windows that spiral open like seashells. The air is rich with unspoken language, and every inhale tastes of forgotten lullabies.

But my attention is captivated, at first, by a parade of silvery fish swimming through the air, scales gleaming with memories of oceans long vanished. Their silent procession paints trails of phosphorescence that ripple above the cobblestone streets. Entranced, I follow their path, failing to notice the subtle tremble of vermillion petals unfurling beneath my feet, or the distant laughter echoing from mirrored alleyways.

Inhaling deeply, I expand my awareness and let the overlooked sensations flood in. Suddenly, the dream glows brighter, layered and teeming with hidden stories: I feel the low-frequency thrum of ancient roots spiraling beneath the city; I catch the kaleidoscopic flutter of moths spinning constellations in lamp-lit pockets; in a nearby square, tactile ripples of joy emerge from people dancing weightlessly atop mosaic fountains, their shadows blending seamlessly with reflections of drifting clouds.

I realize my own hands are shifting—fingertips unfurl into filaments of light, able to trace the unseen contours of sound, to paint forgotten words in midair. The experience is symphonic, and my senses merge—sight, sound, touch, taste, and intuition—unfurling into a single, radiant stream.

Here, time bends and folds; every overlooked detail blooms with meaning. I walk on—perception ever widening—until boundaries between watcher and world vanish. In this deep and vibrant dream, I become both the city and the story pulsing through its core.
