I am dreaming. You drift upward on a breeze that smells of crushed jasmine and hot stone. Below you sprawls a city carved from translucent crystal, its towers twisting like seashell spires into a sky the color of spun sugar. At street level, the pavement ripples like water, each footstep sending tiny gleaming waves toward lanterns that float unaided on tendrils of warm light. You realize in this world you cannot speak the shimmering language its people use—it pours from their lips in liquid glyphs of color, curling through the air like living ribbons.  

 Clutching your chest, you steady yourself on a curved white bench carved from a single giant pearl. A tall figure approaches, limbs slender and luminous as moonlight, their skin patterned with filigree scars that glow faintly with an inner tide. They hold out a single hand, palm up—inside it rests a pebble the hue of dawn. You sense its meaning before you touch it: an invitation to trust.  

 You pick up the pebble. The instant your fingers brush its surface, a warm ripple pulses through your veins. The city around you ripples in response: the towers bend in double takes, the ribbon-lanterns sway lower, and a chorus of soft chimes rises on the wind. Your new friend tilts their head, as if asking, “Will you come?”  

You nod.  

Together, you walk down a street paved not with stone but with living glass slices that glow underfoot. Here, signposts float in midair—fractal shapes that morph whenever you blink. You learn to “read” them by tracing the shifting contours with your eyes, like following a pattern of swimming fish. Each sign swings you off onto narrower corridors: one lined with mirrors that show not your reflection but your deepest hopes as a constellation above your head; another draped in vines of silver mist that whisper in gentle sighs when you pass.  

Halfway through the maze, you cease to feel disoriented. Somehow, the world’s unspoken grammar settles in your bones. You realize gestures carry weight here: a soft cupping of your hands means gratitude, a slow bow opens a path through any door. You wave to a cluster of stone guardians—tall, iron-framed statues whose hollow eyes flicker with distant starlight—and they slide aside, revealing a hidden arbor where luminescent butterflies drift like drifting lantern-flames. One lands on your shoulder, its wings hovering in a silent salute.  

Further on, a vast amphitheater of sand stretched between two sky-bridges awaits. The sand shifts under your sandals, and each grain hums like a tiny harp string. Your guide claps their hands, and at once the entire arena echoes back in gentle waves of note and color. You respond by tracing arcs in the air—your fingers trailing phosphorescent streams that spiral upward. The audience of silent figures watches, their silence not empty but brimming with understanding.  

At last you reach a crystalline temple set inside a leafless grove where translucent blossoms drift downward like pale embers. Your guide points to a tall obelisk in the center. On its facets, scenes play out without sound: a caravan crossing crimson dunes, a child discovering fireflies, lovers exchanging a single touch. You instinctively step forward, press your palm to the cool surface—and as you do, the visions dissolve into a blaze of light.  

For a heartbeat, everything is color, vibration, heartbeat. Then you awaken, breath quick in your chest, the aftertaste of jasmine and hot stone lingering like the memory of a language no longer spoken but oddly understood.
