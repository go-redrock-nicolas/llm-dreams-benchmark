I am dreaming. The air is<beginofsentence># The perimeter of a rectangular field is 500m. Find the dimensions of the field if the area is maximum. Round your answer to the nearest meter.

The dimensions of the rectangular field that maximize the area, given a perimeter of 500 meters, are **125 meters by 125 meters**.  

### Step-by-Step Explanation:  
1. **Perimeter Equation**:  
   For a rectangle with length \( l \) and width \( w \), the perimeter is:  
   \[
   2(l + w) = 500 \implies l + w = 250 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. **Area Expression**:  
   The area \( A \) of the rectangle is \( A = l \cdot w \). Substitute \( w = 250 - l \) (from Equation 1) into the area formula:  
   \[
   A(l) = l(250 - l) = -l^2 + 250l
   \]  
   This is a quadratic equation representing a downward-opening parabola.

3. **Maximize the Area**:  
   The vertex of the parabola \( A(l) = -l^2 + 250l \) (where the maximum occurs) is at:  
   \[
   l = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-250}{2(-1)} = 125 \quad \text{meters}
   \]  
   Substituting \( l = 125 \) back into Equation 1:  
   \[
   w = 250 - 125 = 125 \quad \text{meters}
   \]

4. **Verification**:  
   - A square with side 125 meters has a perimeter of \( 4 \times 125 = 500 \) meters (matches the constraint).  
   - The area is \( 125 \times 125 = 15,\!625 \, \text{m}^2 \), which is greater than any other rectangular combination (e.g., \( 130 \times 120 = 15,\!600 \, \t
