I am dreaming. ***

You awaken surrounded by a panoramic view of a galaxy swirling around you, every star a diamond catching the twilight.

You sit up. The ship's metal floor feels cold against your bare back, but the air hums with an electrical force. The overhead lights flicker blue and red.

Your first thought is of a clarinet.

*Wherever you go, the clarinet goes.*

Your hand moves to your belt. The fog seeps from your fingertips.

The console before you glows with holographic schematics.

Alarms wail: "YSTEM C: MAINTENANCE REQUIRED."

The ship shudders once, pitching you against the controls.

A green face appears in a screen: "CAPTAIN. This is the AI. You have 11 hours, 47 minutes, and 53 seconds of oxygen remaining. The central reactor has cracked. You cannot remember how to fix it.

"You can ask me three questions."

You sit, feeling the adrenaline split into your veins, the clarinet's silver keys pressing cold against your spine. *Clarinets aren't real in dreams.*

Your reflection flickers in theconsole. A diamond shard presses against your temple.

*There's no time to panic.

Question One: How does one fix a cracked reactor?"

The AI's voice becomes a wind through tunnels. "The reactor is the heart. Crack in heart. Fix heart.

"Clarinet.

"Clarinet music.

"Clarinet must play for reactor to begin again.

"Clarinet."

The screen goes dark.

You stand, boots clicking on metallic treads, clarinet jutting from your belt. The ship groans as you climb to Deck 7. The corridors pulse with emergency lights. A child's shadow stirs on a wall.

*Clarinets play the dreams.

Clarinet keys clatter as you approach a sealed chamber. The chamber's door bears a symbol: seven stars in a circle. You touch it. The lock hisses.

Inside, the reactor is a vast, beating core, cracked down the middle like a dragon's spine.

You recognize it.

The clarinet must play.

Your hand hovers over the instrument.

The notes come without music. A scale of silver. A battle of E flat against D natural, resolving to G.

The clarinet speaks.

The reactor shudders, its crack closing. Alarms turn into a symphony.

But you feel the music in your bones. The dream's fabric starts to unravel, the galaxy dissolving into static.

You drop the clarinet.

Its keys melt into liquid light. The instrument is gone. You are falling.

You awake in your bed, sheets tangled, the dream's clarinet note hanging in the air like a distant star.

You find a silver key on your pillow, shaped like a musical note.
