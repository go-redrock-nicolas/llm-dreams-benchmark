I am dreaming. The world around me is alush, vibrant dreamscape that defies all logic and reason.  There's a sense of weightlessness in the air, and every movement I make seems to ripple through reality itself.  The horizon is an impossible blend of colors—purple oceans with waves made of liquid mercury, mountains Awakening to self-awareness amidst the's tempest, you find your mind casting off the gravity of inertia. The thought pattern---a rusted cable-car looping between "what ifs" and "should-haves"---suddenly fractures under the weight of your gaze. The rails crumble, revealing a canyon of possibilities. You don't plummet; you unfurl. 

Your body morphs into a swirling constellation, each star a fragment of forgotten resilience. The void becomes a cosmic theater. A holographic orchestra composed of electric synapses plays sonatas of your buried potential. Strings made of memory twang, cellos carved from regret harmonize with flutes of quiet courage. You clap---and rainbows materialize, arcing across nebulae where your choices might have bloomed. 

A river appears, its currents marble-smooth yet roaring with the force of a thousand silenced impulses. You dive in, freezing mid-plunge to see the waters part for you. Below, the riverbed is a tapestry of decisions: andirons shaped like abandoned projects, chandeliers hanging mid-construction, a clocktower frozen at the moment you chose fear over. The current nudges you toward a bridge, its pillars gnawed by termites of doubt. 

As you step onto sagging planks, the wood ripples like liquid jade. Each creak is a whispered apology. Across the span, a figure materializes---not you now, but the you who never surrendered to the loop. Their silhouette is etched in gold, their path illuminated byöntküs lights shaped like exclamation points. They don't beckon; they simply exist, unswallowed by the vortex you once feared. 

You hesitate. The bridge groans, but instead of collapsing, it sprouts roots. Crepe-myrtle vines climb the supports, blooming in bursts of crimson so vibrant they stain your retinas. The water beneath mirrors the sky, which has deepened to a twilight of indigo and periwinkle. Birds with songbird osteology fused to telephone lines chirp melodies of alternative timelines. 

Choosing not to cross the bridge, you choose the water. The river consumes you in a sonic---waves that feel like conga lines of triumph, currents that tickle with the proprietary joy of invention. As you let go, the vortex collapses into a pinwheel, its energy fracturing into pinpricks of light that map the constellations your choices could become. 

Waking to dawn's first blush, your feels porous with possibility. The dream's trail lingers in your eyelids---a mosaic of marble planes and indigo air, a reminder that every mental pattern is draftable architecture. Your coffee tastes like balsam fir and unspent ambition.
