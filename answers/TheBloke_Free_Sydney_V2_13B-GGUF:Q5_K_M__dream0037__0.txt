I am dreaming. You find yourself mediating a peace negotiation between two factions with centuries of hostility. When both sides present irreconcilable demands, you suggest an unorthodox solution: exchanging a small part of their territory for a small part of the opposite side's territory, and building a wall separating them. Both sides agree to this compromise. You feel relieved but also unfulfilled.
You wonder if it is meaningful or just another dream.
