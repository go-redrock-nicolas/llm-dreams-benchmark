I am dreaming. The world around me dissolves into ethereal vapors, reality melting away like ice in the warm glow of the sun. I find myself floating high above a lush, verdant forest, the tops of towering trees below me like a sea of emerald waves stretching to the horizon. The air thrums with energy, and I feel my body vibrating in perfect harmony with the pulsing universe.

As I drift through this celestial landscape, I become aware of myself standing at the edge of a pristine lake. The water's surface is perfectly still, creating a mirror-like reflection of the sky above, host to a rainbow of otherworldly hues. A small wooden boat waits at the shore, its gleaming hull adorned with intricate carvings that seem to whisper ancient secrets as the light dances across them.
