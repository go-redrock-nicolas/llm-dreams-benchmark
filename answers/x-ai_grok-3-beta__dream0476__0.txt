I am dreaming. find myself standing at the edge of a vast, otherworldly forest, where the trees are not made of wood but of shimmering obsidian glass, their branches twisting into the sky like frozen bolts of lightning. The air hums with a low, electric resonance, vibrating through my chest, as if the forest itself is alive with secrets. My bare feet sink into a carpet of indigo moss, soft as whispers, yet each step sends a ripple of faint, silvery light outward, illuminating hidden glyphs etched into the ground. I feel a pull, an invisible thread tugging at the core of my being, urging me deeper into this enigmatic realm.

As I wander, I become aware of a weight in my chest—a heavy, unspoken emotion I’ve buried so deep I’d forgotten its name. Fear. Not the sharp, fleeting kind, but a primal, bone-deep dread that I’ve danced around for years, always turning my gaze away just before it could fully surface. It feels threatening, like a storm brewing on the horizon, dark and inevitable. Yet here, in this dreamscape, there’s no running. The forest seems to demand my honesty, its glassy trees reflecting fractured glimpses of my own face—each shard showing a flicker of vulnerability I’ve refused to acknowledge.

I stop at a clearing where a pool of liquid mirror lies, its surface so still it seems to hold the entire universe within its depths. My reflection stares back, but it’s not just me—it’s every version of me I’ve tried to hide. The child who feared abandonment, the teenager who dreaded failure, the adult who shies away from true intimacy. The emotion I’ve avoided pulses stronger now, a storm breaking inside me, and I realize I must face it. I must create space for this fear, let it breathe, let it speak.

I kneel at the edge of the pool, my trembling hands reaching out to touch the surface. The liquid ripples, and a wave of raw, unfiltered emotion surges through me—fear, yes, but also grief, longing, and a desperate need for connection I’ve stifled for too long. It’s overwhelming, a tempest of feeling that threatens to drown me, yet the forest holds me steady. The obsidian trees hum louder, their vibrations syncing with my racing heartbeat, as if singing a lullaby of courage. I let the tears fall, each drop hitting the pool and creating concentric rings of light that illuminate the clearing in hues of violet and gold.

And then, something extraordinary happens. From the center of the pool rises a figure—a ethereal being woven from starlight and shadow, its form shifting between human and something ancient, unknowable. It reaches out with hands of gossamer light, and its touch is warm, not threatening. “You’ve hidden from me,” it whispers, its voice a chorus of winds and forgotten songs, “but I am not your enemy. I am the part of you that seeks to live fully, to love without walls, to stand in the storm and know you’ll survive.”

I feel the fear transform as I sit with it, no longer a monstrous shadow but a wounded fragment of myself begging to be seen. I embrace this emotion, wrapping metaphorical arms around its trembling form, and the forest responds. The obsidian trees shimmer brighter, their branches weaving together overhead to form a cathedral of glass and light. The indigo moss beneath me pulses with warmth, and the glyphs on the ground glow with a language I suddenly understand—words of forgiveness, of release, of reunion.

I stand, lighter now, as the starry being dissolves back into the pool, leaving behind a single shimmering feather that feels like a promise. The threatening storm of emotion has passed, replaced by a quiet strength, a knowing that I can face anything as long as I don’t turn away from myself. The forest begins to fade, the edges of the dream softening like watercolor on wet paper, but I carry this newfound courage with me, a beacon glowing softly in my chest as I drift back toward waking.

This dream, born from the deepest wells of imagination, is not just a vision but a revelation—a reminder that even the most threatening emotions, when faced with open-hearted bravery, can transform into the very light that guides us home.
