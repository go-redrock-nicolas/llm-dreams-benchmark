I am dreaming. You find yourself standing alone on the vast, shimmering expanse of the Mirrored Sea. The mirrored water stretches out infinitely, reflecting the dueling heavens above - one a tumultuous canvas of_provider,with angry, roiling clouds, and the other a serene canvas of twinkling stars. The water's edge is marked by a row of ancient, gnarled trees, their roots buried deep within the mirrored surface.

Suddenly, a colossal wave emerges from the horizon, its crest churning with eyes that seem to gaze directly into your soul. It approaches swiftly, and as it crashes down, it washes over you, pulling you into its depths. You are no longer in control, and the world around you shifts into a stormy, chaotic realm.

You are now in a colause, the air thick with the electric scent of ozone. A towering storm cloud looms above, thunder rumbling like a feral beast's growl. Lightning bolts crisscross the sky like guilty secrets, illuminating the  that surround you - faces from your past, twisted in anger or pain, their eyes accusing.

A familiar sensation begins to rise within you, a hot, prickling pressure that you've learned to keep at bay. But here, in this dreamscape, it's impossible to suppress. It grows, swelling like the storm around you, desperate to break free.

As you open your mouth to scream, the pressure explodes outward, not in the harsh, ugly sound you feared, but as a brilliant, shimmering orb of light. It hangs in the air for a moment before hurtling towards the storm cloud, piercing it. The cloud tears, revealing a peaceful sky behind, the angry storm seeded and transformed.

You find yourself standing on a lush, untouched shore. The ancient trees from before stand tall around you, their leaves whispering secrets in the gentle breeze. The mirrored sea stretches out inf policy towards to the horizon, now calm and still, reflecting the serene sky above. Above, a single cloud drifts lazily, its shape reminiscent of a phoenix, a symbol of rebirth and renewal.

The anger that once felt so dangerous, so overwhelming, now feels like a tool, a force that can carve out new paths and transform old pain into something wholesome and free. You understand now, in this dream, that anger isn't something to fear or suppress, but to embrace, to use, to learn from.

As you wake up, you carry this understanding with you, ready to face the day, ready to face your anger, ready to face yourself.
