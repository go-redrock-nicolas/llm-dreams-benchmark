I am dreaming. In the dream, I am soaring through an endless, shimmering expanse of space. Time seems to slow to a crawl, as if the very fabric of the universe is bending to accommodate my wonderment. Each celestial body whispers its ancient secrets, painting vivid scenes of forgotten eras across my mind's eye.

Suddenly, I am plucked from the vastness and find myself amidst a bustling city street, a sea of hurried individuals. Time speeds up, a blur of motion and noise overtakes me, stretching my senses to their limits. Each stride, each exchange blends into the next, and I feel overwhelmed by the flurry of activity.

As the city fades into the distance and I meander to a tranquil shoreline, time regains its balance. Moments stretch and contract, ebbing like the tide as I savor the delicate dance of light on water. The sun's descent seems to pause in mutual admiration, and every hue of the sky lingers, savored like a timeless treasure.

In this dream, time is no longer a constant or a boundary, but a fluid entity shaped by my engagement and delight in each moment.
