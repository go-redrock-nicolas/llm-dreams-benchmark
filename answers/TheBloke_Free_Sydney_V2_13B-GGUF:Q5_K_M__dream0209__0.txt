I am dreaming. You discover a parallel dimension that operates according to completely different types of physical forces. To accomplish even basic movement in this alien framework, you must use your mind and energy as the medium for expressing your intentions and desires. In this realm, everything is alive, and everything can communicate with you through telepathy.

In this dream, you learn how to navigate this unfamiliar world by understanding its unique language of vibrations and frequencies. You also meet fascinating creatures who challenge your perceptions and beliefs about life and consciousness.

You wake up feeling inspired and curious. You wonder if there is more to reality than meets the eye. You decide to explore this dream again later.
