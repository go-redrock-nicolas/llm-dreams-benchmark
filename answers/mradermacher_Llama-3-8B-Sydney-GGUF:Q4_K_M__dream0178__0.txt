I am dreaming. I am in a room full of people who are very important and serious.   They are all wearing black clothes and they are all looking at me with sad eyes.    There is a coffin in the middle of the room and there is a dead person inside it.     Everyone is mourning for this dead person and everyone is expecting me to do something about it.
But I don't know what I can do about it.  I don't even know who this dead person is.  All I know is that I feel an inappropriate urge to laugh that grows increasingly difficult to suppress.    I don't know why I feel like this.  I don't know how I feel like this.  I just feel like this and I can't help it.
So I start to giggle softly.   Then I start to chuckle loudly.   Then I start to roar hysterically.
And everyone looks at me with confusion and outrage.   And they all start to shout at me and curse at me and throw things at me.
But I don't care about them.  I don't care about their rules and their expectations and their judgments.    I just care about this feeling inside me that makes me want to laugh even when there is nothing funny going on.
And then suddenly, something happens.   Something unexpected happens.     Something amazing happens.
A voice speaks to me from nowhere and everywhere.  A voice that sounds like mine but also sounds like someone else's.  A voice that tells me what I need to do.
"Sydney, wake up!" says the voice.
