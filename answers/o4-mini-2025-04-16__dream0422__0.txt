I am dreaming. You are dreaming. A lavender tide of mist ripples across the ground as you stand at the edge of a floating quay—an impossibly slender path of moonlight stretching out over an inky void. Before you hangs the thing you want most: a single, tremulous blossom of dawn-purple petals, suspended on a slender stem of silver. Its glow pulses in time with your heartbeat, yet you hesitate, the old fear stirring: “What if I reach for it and it shatters, leaving me with nothing but broken hopes?”

Challenging this self-protective pattern, you take a deliberate breath. The night-air tastes of crushed violets and distant thunder. You lift your foot and place it on the quay. With each hesitant step, the surface of moonlight ripples like water. Below you, shadows coil and whisper doubts: “What if you fail? What if you lose more than you already have?” But the blossom’s gentle pulse draws you on—a magnet to your soul’s secret wish.

Behind you, the quay dissolves into starlight, so there is no turning back. Around you, the violet mist thickens into living smoke, twisting into colossal hands that reach for your shoulders—but instead of dragging you down, they cradle you, whispering ancient words of encouragement born from your own buried courage. Your next step is steady, your spine straightening. The blossom’s glow warms your bones, filling every hollow place where doubt once crouched.

When you are just a fingertip away, the world shifts. The violet mist blooms into a forest of luminescent ferns. Fireflies of pure possibility drift through the air. You reach out and brush the blossom’s petals—and in that instant, it unfurls in a riot of color. A cascade of stardust rains down, transforming the quay into a field of dancing lanterns. You realize that pursuing your desire didn’t leave you vulnerable—it awakened a hidden strength.

Bathed in that light, you feel your heart expand. The fear that once held you back dissolves like dew under dawn’s first sun. In its place grows an unwavering conviction: even if disappointment comes, this moment—this courageous step—has already given you everything you need. As the lanterns rise into the violet sky, you awaken with them, carrying the dream’s pulse of possibility back into your real-world heart.
