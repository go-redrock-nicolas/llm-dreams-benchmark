I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The sky above you is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, shifting and rippling as if alive, reflecting a world that is not quite real. Below, the ground pulses like a heartbeat—veins of bioluminescent moss snake through obsidian stone, glowing faintly turquoise with each throb. You stand at the center of a floating archipelago of jagged islands, suspended in a violet-hued void. Each island is tethered to the next by bridges of spider-silk thread, glinting with dew that evaporates into whispers: *“Five threads, five deaths, one soul to weave them.”*  

**Task One: The Clockwork Heart of the Sun**  
To your left, a colossal mechanical sun ticks apart, its gears rusted and grinding. Time itself is unraveling here—birds freeze mid-flight, then burst into motion like flickering film. You must repair the heart of the sun before its final tick, or all memory of the past will dissolve. Your hands grow claws of silver as you pry open the sun’s casing, finding a labyrinth of gears made of teeth and stardust. One misstep, and the teeth bite into your fingers, erasing years of your life from existence.  

**Task Two: The Drowning Library**  
Behind you, a tower of water swirls upward, defying gravity. Inside, books float like jellyfish, their pages fluttering like wings. Each contains a soul—a life you’ve touched, a choice you’ve made. The water is rising, and if the books drown, those lives will vanish. You dive into the liquid air, lungs burning as ink bleeds into your vision. A child’s diary sobs in the depths, its words smearing into oblivion. You clutch it tight, but the weight of forgotten promises drags you down.  

**Task Three: The Symphony of Shadows**  
To your right, a forest of black crystal grows, each shard humming a different note. A conductor’s baton floats in your grip, carved from your own spine. You must orchestrate the shadows—wraiths with violins of bone—to play a harmony that will seal a rift in reality. But the shadows rebel, screeching dissonance. One wrong note, and the rift swallows a continent whole. The baton trembles, splintering your ribs with every movement.  

**Task Four: The Feast of Mirrors**  
Above, a banquet table hovers, set with plates of glass and goblets of ice. Twelve reflections of yourself sit around it, each a version of who you could have been: the warrior, the poet, the traitor, the saint. They demand you eat a morsel from each plate—a memory, a sin, a dream—to keep the table from collapsing into a black hole. But each bite floods you with foreign lives. You taste blood from a war you didn’t start, salt from tears you never shed, and honey from a love you’ll never know.  

**Task Five: The Bridge of Breath**  
Beneath your feet, the spider-silk bridge frays. To cross it, you must exhale a song that turns your regrets into wind. The melody must be perfect; a single sour note will unravel the bridge, and you’ll fall into the void where forgotten gods scream. Your throat is raw, your lungs hollowed by the weight of all you’ve carried. Yet the song begins—a keening wail that shatters the silence, each note a shard of forgiveness.  

The pressure mounts. The sun ticks faster. The library drowns. The shadows scream. The feast trembles. The bridge unravels.  

You are everywhere at once—mending, diving, conducting, devouring, singing. Sweat beads into mercury droplets that roll off your skin and explode into smoke. Your heartbeat syncs with the sun’s ticking, the library’s rising tide, the shadows’ cacophony. You feel yourself splintering, a soul stretched too thin.  

Then, silence.  

The threads snap taut. The islands collide. The void swallows.  

You wake gasping, the taste of honey and blood on your tongue, the echo of twelve voices whispering in your skull: *“You chose… but nothing was spared.”*
