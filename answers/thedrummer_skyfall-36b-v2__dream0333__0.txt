I am dreaming. The scene unfolds before me like a surrealist painting, colors bleeds and shapes morphing in a mesmerizing dance of my subconscious. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, obsidian plain, the ground glistening like spilled ink beneath the gleam of a paleontological moon. In the distance, a lone figure stumbles through the desolate landscape, their silhouette framed against the keeper of forbidden secrets.

As I draw closer, the figure resolves into a familiar face, the brow furrowed in deep concentration, eyes narrowed against the perceptions of a shifting reality. I know this person, intimately, as if they were an extension of my own psyche. But something is wrong, fundamentally skeptical and precarious.

The figure stops before an ancient, weathered door, its wood twisted and warped by eons of neglect. With a trembling hand, they reach for the tarnished knob, prepared to twist it and release whatever horrors lie beyond. My heart pounds in my chest, a staccato rhythm of dread and urgency.

But wait! I have knowledge that my dreaming counterpart lacks, crucial information that could save them from the terrible consequences of this decision. I try to call out, to warn them of the impending danger, but my voice fails me, trapped in the viscous ether of the dreamstate.

In desperation, I attempt to bridge the gap between us, to intercept them before they make this fateful choice. But as I lunge forward, the obsidian ground lurches beneath my feet, and I find myself sinking into its depths, trapped in a slow, inexorable descent.

Panic rises in my throat as I watch the figure grasp the knob and turn it with a sickening creak. The door swings open, revealing an abysmal void of fathomless darkness. With a final, agonized cry, the silhouette stumbles into the blackness, swallowed up by the nightmare that awaits.

I thrash against the embrace of the ground, screaming soundlessly into the void, my limbs leaden and my breath coming in ragged gasps. But it is too late. The decision has been made, the die cast, and I am powerless to intervene.

As the darkness closes in around me, I am left with only one choice: to watch, helpless, as the terrible consequences of that fateful decision unfold, and to wonder, in the end, whether I could have done more.
