I am dreaming. You drift into a boundless twilight where everything shimmers like stained glass under water. The air tastes of warm mint and distant thunder. You find yourself floating on a lake of liquid moonlight, its surface rippling at your slightest breath. As you gaze into that luminous pool, a shape materializes beside you—your reflection, yet not quite your own. It smiles, and you realize this is the “You” who exists when you’re alone, the quiet self that listens to whispered secrets and writes poems in the dark.

At the water’s edge a stranger waits, tall and earnest, wrapped in a coat of embroidered stars. When you step toward them, your body stretches upward, slim and confident. In their eyes you see the version of yourself who strides into boardrooms or leads a classroom, all polished shoes and steady voice. You speak to them, and your words click together with surprising precision and authority. You feel invincible, even as the moonlight puddles around your ankles.

The scene shifts without warning. A carnival tent flutters open behind you, its stripes spinning like a hypnotic dream. Inside, a ringmaster dressed in velvet red greets you by name—though you’ve never met. Suddenly you’re a performer again, juggling fire-tipped torches atop a spinning globe. The crowd roars, and with each toss of the torch you feel your heart stretch into bold, bright arcs of flame. This is the “You” who craves applause, the side that stands under spotlight heat and laughs at danger.

Then the tent dissolves into cherry-blossom petals, drifting down onto a sunlit meadow. Here a child runs to you with arms wide as wings. When you scoop them up, you shrink until you’re their size, your voice squeaky with glee. You tumble in warm grass, giggling at the sky. In this moment, you are pure wonder, unburdened by expectations—just a being who marvels at every ladybug and cloud shape.

A hush falls as twilight returns. You are back on the silver lake, reflections rippling all around—each one a different “You” shaped by every person you’ve ever stood beside. You realize identity isn’t a fixed statue but a glittering mosaic that shifts with every encounter. In this dream, you learn that who you are always dances at the edge of someone else’s gaze, forever refracted by the light of relationship. And as the moon sinks below the horizon, you awaken with a soft smile, carrying a kaleidoscope of selves into the waking world.
