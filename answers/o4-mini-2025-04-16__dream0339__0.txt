I am dreaming. In this moment of unexpected elation, you feel as though your chest has blossomed into a thousand glowing petals, each pulse of light sending ripples of warmth down your arms. The world around you hums in a perfect, crystalline tone—the color of buttercups and sunrise, a sound that tastes like spun honey. You lift your head and discover you’re standing in a meadow of towering flowers, their petals translucent glass, veins pulsing with liquid gold. With every heartbeat, the blossoms lean toward you as if thanking you for your presence.

You take a step, and the ground beneath you isn’t earth at all but a soft mosaic of living mosaic tiles, shifting patterns of blues and purples that form swirling galaxies under your feet. Each footfall sends stardust drifting upward in lazy spirals. As you move, the air itself feels alive—tiny motes of light drift around you like fireflies waltzing to a melody that only your soul can hear. You reach out and one of these motes settles on your fingertip; you can feel gentle laughter echoing from it, as if joy itself were speaking your name.

A breeze carries the scent of rain on copper and the distant laughter of children at play. You follow that sound until the meadow edges fall away, revealing a river of liquid moonlight. The current glows softly, and you step into it without fear, feeling its cool caress swirl around your ankles. Instantly, you become buoyant—floating above the water’s surface as though gravity has decided to take the afternoon off. Behind you, the river stretches into a ribbon of silvery light that winds between mountains made of amethyst and rose quartz.

Above, the sky unfolds like an endless fresco. Shades of teal, lavender, and peach ripple across the dome, and small winged creatures—neither bird nor insect—dance in loops and spirals. One of them perches on your shoulder, its wings shimmering like opal in sunlight. It sings a note so pure you can taste it on your tongue—something warm and minty and bright. The creature whispers in a voice like wind chimes, “This is the heart of wonder,” and as it speaks, your own heart swells with gratitude for a world you never knew you possessed.

Suddenly, the river splits and forms a stairway of light leading upward. You climb, each step a gentle promise of newfound delight. When you emerge at the summit, clouds ripple beneath your feet, and before you stands a great crystal tree whose branches reach into every corner of the sky. Hanging from its limbs are tiny lanterns shaped like human hearts, each one glowing with someone’s secret dream. You realize that yours drifts among them, shimmering more brilliantly than the rest. It quivers with the purest joy you’ve ever felt—unearned, unasked for, and completely yours.

As you reach out to touch your lantern, it ripples and explodes into a cascade of living color that spreads across the sky. Every hue you’ve ever dreamed of—every mood, every secret longing—floods the heavens in a kaleidoscope of brilliance. In that moment, your laughter joins the song of the dream world, a note so clear and full of wonder it creates a new constellation in the sky. And in that flash of light and sound, you understand that the deepest magic of this place isn’t in its splendor, but in the simple truth that you are here, alive and joyous, in a realm born entirely from your own heart.
