I am dreaming.

Within the strange, silvery twilight of the dream, my surroundings shimmer — both familiar and profoundly alien. Alumni portraits of my ancestors peer down at me from the wood-paneled walls of an endless hallway, their gazes brimming with secrets I never questioned before. The faces morph gently as I approach: one moment serene, the next, masks of sorrow and warning.

News comes to me on a swirling wind, in the clipped, echoing voice of my grandmother — she tells me that much of what I’ve known about our lineage is a carefully spun cocoon of comforting stories. Images flash through the air as living paintings: a beloved uncle who was not who he claimed; a great-grandmother’s sorrow hidden behind decades of tightly held silence; ancient letters blooming into flames that shape themselves into cryptic symbols.

My heart trembles, but I do not drown in the sensation. I inhale deeply, feeling the cool silkiness of the dream-air, willing myself to float rather than fall. Each pulse of confusion washes over me like a tide, and I, drifting like a sturdy boat, resist the urge to capsize.

I decide to walk forward with slow, deliberate steps, my bare feet padding on the ancient, creaking floor. As I move, storybook pages detach themselves from the walls, floating around my head. I pluck one out of the air and examine the text, written in a shifting script that somehow makes sense the longer I gaze at it. The truth is not laid bare all at once, but instead comes in gentle ripples. The lies, I understand, were seeds of kindness sown in rocky ground; the reality was sharp, but survivable.

A gentle sound — childlike laughter mixed with the rustle of wind in leaves — echoes from far away. I follow it to a sunlit room opening off the main corridor. There, I see myself as a child, building towers of colored glass, unbothered by what is real and what is myth. I kneel beside my younger self, possibly to offer comfort, but find that I am the one soothed, grounded by the memory of innocence.

When I stand, the colored glass reflects my face — older, wiser, yet softened by acceptance. I realize I am able to hold the complicated truths and the gentle fictions at once, letting neither define me entirely. The dream, now warm and shimmering, begins to fade like fog at sunrise, leaving me with the knowledge that equilibrium is found not in certainty, but in the grace with which I navigate uncertainty.
