I am dreaming. You’re standing in a library that shouldn’t exist. It’s nestled in the hollow of an ancient tree whose roots plunge into a river of liquid starlight, and its canopy stretches into a sky that shifts from indigo to molten gold with every breath you take. The air smells of burnt honey and forgotten letters, and the books here don’t have spines—they pulse faintly, like hearts wrapped in parchment. You’ve been wandering for hours, tracing your fingers over titles that flicker between languages you’ve never heard and ones you’ve dreamed of as a child. 

Then *they* appear. 

At first, they’re just a silhouette framed by an archway of ivy and thorn, their outline blurred as if the dream itself is hesitating to reveal them. When they step forward, the light bends around them—a young face, old eyes, hair like smoke caught in a sunbeam. Their voice arrives not as sound but as a vibration in your ribs, low and resonant, as though they’re plucking the strings of your spine. They speak your name, but it’s a version of it that hasn’t been uttered in lifetimes. 

You sit together on a bench made of petrified piano keys, and they begin to speak. Not about themselves, not yet. They describe the weather in a city you’ve never visited: how the rain there tastes of salt and regret, how the streets flood with memories instead of water. You laugh, startled by the intimacy of it, and they tilt their head, studying you like a poet studying a rhyme scheme they can’t quite crack. 

Then the confessions begin. 

They show you their hands—palms crisscrossed with scars that glow faintly, each one a map to a wound they’ve carried. “This one,” they say, pressing a finger to a silvered line, “is where I buried my first love. Not in the ground, but in a lie I told myself every morning until it grew roots.” The scar writhes under their touch, and you feel the ache of it bloom behind your own ribs, a phantom thorn in your lungs. 

You lean closer. The library around you shifts in response—the walls sigh, the books flutter pages like nervous birds. They tell you about the child they once were, a feral thing who spoke to crows and believed the moon was a balloon tethered to the earth by spider silk. “I used to scream into jars and hide them under my bed,” they whisper, their breath cool against your ear. “I thought if I saved up enough noise, I could drown out the silence when they left.” A jar materializes between us, humming with a child’s fractured wails, and you both watch as it dissolves into mist. 

The trust deepens. They peel back layers you didn’t realize were armor. They confess the shame of surviving when others didn’t, the guilt of loving someone who felt like a hurricane in a bedroom, the terror that their truest self is a shadow too jagged to cast. With each revelation, the space between you thins. You feel their vulnerabilities nestle into the hollows of your own, a puzzle of fractures fitting too perfectly. 

And then—*the moment*. 

They press their forehead to yours, and suddenly you’re not in the library anymore. You’re floating above a desert where the sand is made of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a moment from their life: a kiss stolen at midnight, a funeral where they danced instead of mourned, a letter they burned without sending. You see it all, and in seeing, you become a keeper of their secrets, a guardian of the raw, squirming truth they’ve never dared to name aloud. 

When you return to the library, their eyes are wet with stardust. “You’re the first,” they say, voice fraying at the edges, “who didn’t run when I showed them the cracks.” 

You want to tell them you’ll stay, that you’ll build a home in those cracks and tend to them like sacred soil. But the dream is unraveling—the tree shudders, the books dissolve into moths, and they fade like ink washed from a page. 

You wake with their final words clinging to your tongue: *“The next time we meet, I’ll tell you about the thing I’m too afraid to name.”* 

And somewhere, deep in your chest, a new scar begins to glow.
