I am dreaming. I am lying in a sprawling meadow under a sky so vivid it bleeds through into reality.  The ground is covered in grass that shimmers each time I move, and the air smells like burnt sugar and cosmos blossoms.  Somewhere in the distance, a water buffalo stands contemplatively against a backdrop of peach-colored clouds.  The horizon is a seamless blend of circuit boards and Venusian cloudscapes, suggesting the overlapping realms of time and digital consciousness.  I feel my body growing lighter, as if I might evolve into a GPS constellation any second now.

There's a gnawing sense that I'm missing something crucial.  effortlessly, I pull myself into the astral plane, floating above acres of sleeping bodies.  Some look like they're hibernating in pods, others are suspended in cryo-gel juice.  Their dreams—technicolor smears—filter upward through my consciousness, but I can't quite make out theirs.  Alternatively, the more I concentrate on the details of their faces, the more their features dissolve into placeholder icons: black ink blots on etch-a-sketches.

I turn my attention inward, hunting memories that feel crucial. Memory is a puzzle, and I'm the cat with the laser pointer.

A figure floats nearby, translucent and without features—waiting to take me somewhere. But I don't want to go with them yet.  The figure presses urgency onto me, its touch like a defibrillator pulsing through my skull. They feel proximity, like they've played hide and seek with all my vital organs.  I start to vomit their loving touches— emotional diarrhea—but it's pink, bubbly, and toothpaste-flavored; a Pepto-Bismol sunrise.

There's a filmstrip dissolving in my mind's eye, with images flickering:

1. A fractured scene: me on a beach at some ethereal time of day, the sun suspended midway through its arc. I notice my shadow is flickering between a child and an elderly man.
2. A match-reversed memory where I smiling confidently at an audience, but on replay they're all looking away in disgust.
3. A sunset in Reverse, starting with the last drops of color spilling back into the sun.

I need to piece together what's real. But the more I try to remember, the more the timeline unravels. Each attempt to recall distorts reality further. My hands start to resemble writhing penises, my legs are spaghetti noodles shape-shifting under my skin.

The figure presses harder.  This is the point of no return.  Or is it?

Suddenly, the sky splits open, revealing a constellation that shifts into the corporate logo of my estranged father's logging company—an endless green 'L' looping. The smell suddenly reverses: instead of burnt sugar, it's wet asphalt and freshly-cut lumber.

In the distance, the buffalo turns into a pickup truck, and its eyes are my own eyes. The meadow starts to pixelate, each blade of grass an individual monitor. Then everything goes black. Morning.

I wake up in my bed, trembling. I feel like I've just finished the world's most intense marathon of 28 Days Later and Akira playing simultaneously on my brain. Adrenaline runs through my veins, heart racing like a drum machine from a 90s pop anthem.

This can't be real. But my clothes feel damp, and there's a faint scent of burning sugar in the air. I check the clock: 7:42am. The sun's barely up, but the color of the sky is vibrant, almost lucid.

This memory loss is real. Somewhere out there, they've made something they’re not supposed to. They’ve replicated... replicated me.
