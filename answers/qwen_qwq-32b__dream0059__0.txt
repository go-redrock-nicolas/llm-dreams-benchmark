I am dreaming. I wake up to a world transformed: the hum of electricity is gone, the glow of screens extinguished.  The silence is profound, like the earth itself has been rewired.  My fingers brush my phone on the bedside table - it's cold and inert as a brick.  Beyond the window, dawn's light paints the sky in desperate hues of orange and purple, but the city below is a carcass of its former self.  Cars stranded in mid-commute, their engines dead; skyscrapers stand like skeletal giants under a sky stripped of drone trails.  I step outside, the air crisp and oddly clearer, and gasp at the Milky Way now visible, a river of infinite stars where there were once smog and streetlights.  But the first hint of fear arises when a neighbor's shout pierces the quiet - a child's asthma inhaler won't work, the medical pumps paralyzed by the unexplained darkness.

The world isRewind.
