I am dreaming. The dream unfolds like a grand tapestry, rich with detail and emotion, as I find myself in the resplendent city of Argentum, a place where every cobblestone whispers of history and every spire kisses the heavens. The air is crisp, filled with the scent of blooming jacarandas and the faintest hint of ozone from the city's advanced technologies.

I am Dressian, a citizen of Argentum, and I understand instinctively that society here is stratified into five distinct castes, each with their own elaborate status indicators and rigid relationship protocols. My caste is Opus, the artisans, and my robes are spun from threads of pure silver, adorned with intricate embroidery that shimmers like sunlight on water.

At my neck rests the Opus Signum, a pendant of polished moonstone surrounded by a filigree of platinum. It is a symbol of my status, a mark of respect and responsibility. I wear it with pride, knowing that it represents not just my rank, but the harmonious balance of Argentum's societal structure.

The city bustles around me, a symphony of sounds and colors. Above, Aerium, the sky caste, dart between towers in their graceful, feathered glidesuits, their voices like birdsong as they communicate in rapid cycles of harmonious trills. Below, Tellus, the earth caste, labor in the markets, their rough-spun tunics, earth-toned and practical. They guide the heavy carts pulled by enormous, docile creatures, their calls echoing like the rumble of distant thunder.

I am walking towards the grand Veridium, the Library of the Minds, where I hope to come here to share a new melody I've composed. the streets are lined with luminescent flora, their bioluminescent glow casting an ethereal light on the pathway.

I glimpse a veseca, a rare, iridescent creature, flitting between the trees, its wings leaving trails of stardust in its wake. As I pass the Guild Hall of the Puros, the healers, I hear the melodious hum of their chanting, a soothing balm to the soul.

Suddenly, I hear a faint cry for help. compulsion drives me towards the sound, my heart pounding in my chest. I find a young Aerium woman, her feathers tangled and frayed, struggling to free herself from a thick, thorny vine. Without thinking, I rush to her aid, using my Opus tools to carefully cut away the offending plant. As I work, I hum a soft tune, trying to soothe her frightened mind.

But in my haste, I fail to notice the approach of an Argentum guard, his brass armor polished to a mirror shine, his face a mask of stern disapproval. He watches as I complete my rescue, his eyes narrowing as he takes in the scene.

"You, Opus," he calls out, his voice echoing through the suddenly silent street. "You have committed a grave transgression. You have touched a member of the Aerium caste without permission. For this, you must face the Concilium."

I am lead away through the silent streets, the weight of my transgression pressing down on me like a physical force. As we near the Concilium, a grand hall of shining marble and crystal, I am surrounded and I see a crowd is gathering, their whispers filling the air like the buzzing of bees. I wait many clumsy breaths for what comes next in this surreal experience.
