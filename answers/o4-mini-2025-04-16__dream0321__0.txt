I am dreaming. You blink, and suddenly you’re standing at the rim of a cavern carved into the side of a jagged, rainbow-hued cliff. The air hums with a low, resonant pulse—as if the stone itself is alive. Above you, the sky ripples in bands of molten violet and emerald, streaked with comet-like wisps that burn slowly as they trail away. You feel the cool press of the cave’s entrance against your skin and hear, in the distance, a deep, rhythmic drumbeat that seems to match your own heartbeat.  

A slender figure steps forward from the shadows—a guide, wrapped in silken fabrics that shimmer with every movement, face hidden behind an iridescent mask. In one hand she holds a slender staff topped by a glowing crystal; in the other, a simple black cloth helmet. “Welcome,” her voice is both wind and thunder, “You’ve been chosen to test the limits of sensation. You will soar, you will plummet, you will taste fear and exultation in equal measure. Are you ready?”  

Your pulse quickens. The thrill of the unknown calls to you like a siren song; yet deep in your chest a hollow tremor warns of danger. You nod, though your limbs feel leaden with anxiety. The guide beckons you forward, past a cluster of sleeping dragons whose scaled backs reflect the prismatic cavern light. Their snuffling breaths send tremors through the earth. Beyond them, an arched bridge of living vines stretches across a yawning abyss that seems to dissolve into pure starlight.  

Clutching the helmet, you step onto the bridge. With each footfall the vines pulse underfoot—tender and alive—and the cavern’s drumbeat swells. Halfway across, the guide raises her staff, and suddenly the vines lift you, cradle you, and fling you into the void. Time slows. You descend headfirst into the glittering chasm: the walls streak past in impossible colors, and your scream dissolves into laughter. You feel every atom of air rushing over your face, the weightlessness tugging at your stomach, the exquisite electric zing at your fingertips as you soar.  

Just as the abyss reaches its climax of light and sound, the world shifts again. You find yourself inside a narrow canyon, wind whipping sand in stinging arcs. Ahead a chasm yawns; across it, a single, fraying rope bridge sways in a gale. On the other side, a door carved from living rock glows with pulsing runes. The guide’s voice, distant now, whispers: “One step binds you to glory or to your undoing.”  

Your heart hammers. You imagine yourself collapsing into the void or emerging triumphant into that doorway of legend. Every nerve in your body is alive with possibility. You close your eyes, taste the grit of sand on your tongue, feel the rope’s frayed fibers scrape your palm—and you take that step. The bridge quivers, the wind screams, and beneath you the bottom of the world spins away.  

Then—just as your foot finds solid ground on the far side—a blinding surge of light. You jolt awake in your bed, chest heaving, fingertips tingling, the phantom taste of sand and starlight still on your lips. In the hush before morning, your heart still echoes that ancient drumbeat, and you wonder: was it all a dream, or did you truly dance on the edge of danger—and live to feel the rush?
