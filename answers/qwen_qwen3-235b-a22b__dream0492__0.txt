I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a velvet hush, thick as syrup yet weightless, carrying the scent of burnt honey and forgotten letters. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all— twilight. Each step you take sends ripples through the ground, as though walking on the surface of a pond frozen mid-thought. Your breath quickens, and the horizon responds: mountains rise in the distance like slow, deliberate inhales, their peaks dissolving into ash-gray doves that scatter across a lavender sky.  

You feel it first in your bones—a vibration, a tuning. Your left hand grows heavy, leaden, as if gripping a phantom hourglass, and with it comes a flood of grief so ancient it doesn’t feel like yours. Tears prickle your eyes, but when they fall, they strike the earth as obsidian shards, sprouting thorned vines that coil around your ankles. Pain, you realize, is literal here. Joy, too: when you laugh—a sound like wind chimes shattered by a storm—the ground softens into moss, and fireflies the size of sparrows erupt from the soil, their wings painting the air with iridescent ink.  

A river materializes ahead, but it flows *upward*, defying gravity, its waters thick with glowing spores that hum Gregorian chants. You wade in, and the current tugs at your muscles like a lover’s plea. Suddenly, you’re seven years old, knees scraped, clutching a dead sparrow in trembling hands. The memory is so visceral your chest aches, ribs caving inward like a collapsed cathedral. But the river drinks the sorrow; the spores absorb it, blooming into ephemeral orchids that float skyward, each petal a flickering memory you no longer need to carry.  

Above you, constellations rearrange themselves into anatomical diagrams: a heart pierced by an arrow of starlight, a brain coiled like a serpent swallowing its tail. A voice—not a voice, but the *pressure* of one—whispers through your molars: *“You are the cartographer of your own abyss.”* When you blink, your eyelashes scatter bioluminescent pollen, fertilizing the shadows at your feet. They sprout into creatures—a stag with antlers of fractal glass, a moth whose wings are maps of uncharted synapses. They bow, then dissolve into mist that seeps into your pores, filling the hollows where doubt once nested.  

You climb a staircase that spirals from a single thread of moonlight, each step unraveling and reknitting beneath your bare feet. At the summit, a mirror floats, its surface a roiling mercury sea. You peer in and see not your face, but a cross-section of your spine, vertebrae glowing like subway stations on a luminous map. When you reach out, the mirror bites your reflection away, leaving your back bare, skin smooth as riverstone. The loss is exhilarating.  

The dream shifts. You’re submerged in a womb of ink-black water, weightless, as colossal jellyfish drift past, their bells etched with hieroglyphs of traumas you’ve yet to name. They pulse gently, and with each contraction, your blood becomes champagne, effervescent and stinging. You scream, but your voice births a flock of sapphire finches that nest in your hair, their songs decoding the static in your nerves.  

Then: silence. Stillness.  

You lie on a plain of glass, staring up at a kaleidoscope sun that fractures your shadow into a hundred selves—each walking divergent paths, each flickering between flesh and myth. One weeps into a chalice of her own hands, another stitches their mouth shut with barbed wire, a third dances until their feet melt into mercury. You feel all their endings and beginnings as phantom limbs, a chorus of heartbeats syncing with your own.  

When you wake, your sheets are damp with the sweat of a thousand lifetimes, and the room smells faintly of ozone and lilacs. For a heartbeat, you swear your bones are hollow, filled with starlight and the faint, persistent echo of wings.
