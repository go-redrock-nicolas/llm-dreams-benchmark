I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and I find myself seated at a massive, circular obsidian table that seems to hover just above a floor of molten glass. Flickering candelabra eyes circle the room, casting long, quivering shadows against walls that breathe, expanding and contracting like colossal lungs. Around me sit the negotiators—each masked, each wearing a different expression of serene confidence. Their voices are velvet whispers, curling through my ears like smoke, each promising prosperity, peace, or power, yet behind every syllable I sense a rot of hidden intent.

At my left, the Mask of Gilded Promises leans forward, cloaked in a robe of living gold embroidered with fractal runes. They speak of unity and shared wealth, while their fingertips, dipped in mercurial light, trail secret sigils across the tabletop—ritual marks that threaten to bind me to their will if I accept. The air around them shimmers with a subtle pulse, as though their words themselves carry electric currents meant to seduce my very soul.

On my right, the Mask of Obsidian Reason sits perfectly still, an ebony sheen reflecting every candle’s flame like twin, abyssal eyes. They extol logic, structure, and the cleansing fire of absolute order. But each time they breathe, tiny motes of ash drift downward, hinting that their grand designs would burn the world clean, leaving naught but cold ruins in their wake.

Directly opposite me, at the apex of the table, is the Mask of Shifting Whispers. Their guise is ever-changing—one moment an elegant diplomat with a porcelain smile, the next a snarling beast with antlered horns. They claim to serve “the greater good,” yet every word drips with duplicity, fracturing the very air around us into splintered mirrors. I know that under their mantle of false benevolence lies a hunger for chaos.

As layers of deception become increasingly apparent, reality itself begins to ripple. The walls undulate, revealing hidden doorways that lead into cryptic corridors decorated with frescoes of past betrayals—alliances stabbed in the back, treaties shredded like cursed parchment. Whispers echo from these hallways, snippets of clandestine conversations I was never meant to overhear: “When the moon bleeds red…,” “Once the pact is sealed, burn the contract…,” “He suspects nothing—our moment is nigh…”

I sit up straighter, my pulse quickening. The shimmering surface of the table ripples outward as if I’ve just dropped a pebble of doubt into its glassy heart. Each negotiator’s mask quivers in response, their smiles stretching just a fraction too wide. I realize that the only way to navigate this web of lies is to seize control of the dream itself.

Leaning forward, I place both hands on the table. The molten glass beneath my fingers hums with latent energy, and the room’s breathing slows, as though waiting for my next move. Raising my voice—calm but unyielding—I announce a new term: that every promise, every clause, must be written with my ink and signed in my presence. The candelabra-eyes flare brighter, and the walls hush, exposed for a heartbeat in stark, silent accusation.

One by one, the negotiators bare their true faces: the first, a hollow-eyed marionette; the second, a pillar of cracked stone; the third, a swirl of shifting mist. All their assurances dissolve into the ether. In that moment, I understand: the dream—like any negotiation—is nothing but a labyrinth of smoke and mirrors. Power lies not in their hidden agendas but in my willingness to challenge them, to pull each mask away and force the truth into the open.

As I demand clarity, the table’s molten surface splits along a jagged seam, sending rivulets of glowing glass cascading into darkness below. Light and shadow fight for dominance across the domed ceiling. The negotiators, unmasked and unmoored, shriek in unison—an alien chorus of betrayed ambitions. And then, with one final, decisive gesture, I slam my palm onto the center of the fractured table. The room shatters like a prism, scattering into a thousand shards of iridescent light.

I wake—or so I think—floating in a void of silent stars. In my hand rests a single, shimmering mask. As I lift it to my face, I feel the pull of another negotiation beginning, the promise of fresh illusions waiting to be unmasked. The dream has only just begun.
