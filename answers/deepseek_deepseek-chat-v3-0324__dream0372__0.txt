I am dreaming. The boundaries of my mind stretch and flex like warm taffy as this realization dawns.  

I stand in a vast, sun-drenched orchard where every branch bows heavy with impossibly ripe fruit—peaches blush iridescent gold, cherries glisten like wet rubies, and pears swell with such sweetness that their perfume thickens the air into syrup. Yet my hands remain clenched around a single, shriveled apple, its skin tough as parchment. "There isn't enough," whispers a familiar, threadbare voice—my own, but frayed by years of cramped horizons.

The ground begins to shiver. Roots erupt like waking serpents, splitting the soil to reveal veins of liquid amber pulsing beneath. A great tree at the orchard's heart groans as its bark peels away in ribbons. Not to wither—to *molten*. The trunk gleams now, raw and gold as a newborn sun. "Take," it thrums, not in words but in the basso profundo of a hundred rivers converging. "Fold hunger into your palms and see."

My fingers uncurl. The withered apple blossoms anew in my grip, its flesh splitting to spill seeds that spiral upward, each one catching fire midair to become a tiny, floating lantern. Around me, the trees begin *laughing*, shaking loose fruit that doesn't fall but *suspends*, bobbing like corks on an invisible tide. 

An ember-drunk wind coils around my shoulders, murmuring: "You thought scarcity was the cage? What if the real cage is your hands too full of lack to hold the spillage of galaxies?" 

I wake—or maybe just dream deeper—with my mouth full of honey and my pockets full of stardust, which is, it turns out, the exact weight of enough.
