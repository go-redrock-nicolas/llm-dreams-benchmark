I am dreaming. The scene unfolds before me like an impressionist painting, colors bleeding into one another, shadows dancing with light. I find myself in a bustling city square, the air thick with the aroma of unfamiliar spices and the cacophony of a dozen different languages being spoken at once. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting a warm, amethyst glow across the weathered cobblestones.

In the center of the square, there's a crowd gathering around a slight, elderly woman. She moves with a grace that belies her years, her movements fluid and deliberate as she lays out an intricate array of vibrant fabrics on the ground before her. Each piece is more beautiful than the last, shimmering with iridescent hues and embroidered with delicate patterns that seem to shimmer and shift as they catch the light.

I watch from a distance, transfixed by her work, until finally, she raises her head. Her eyes are a shocking aquamarine, piercing and profound, and a serene smile plays at the corners of her mouth. She begins to speak, her voice like honeyed warmth, even though I cannot comprehend the language. And yet, somehow, I understand.

She speaks of a great sorrow, a disease that has ravaged the lands. The poor and displaced, left without homes, without families, without hope. I feel a heavy weight settle in my chest, a sense of deep sadness and empathy, though I have never experienced or witnessed such things before.

"I hear you," she says, her voice soft and clear, "and my heart breaks."

She raises her arms high, and the fabric at her feet begins to ripple and shimmer. It lifts up slowly, floating like mist before her, out over the rooftops, drifted out to the far reaches of this strange city. And I can see them. The people, those left to suffer both from disease and loneliness. Like shadows of themselves. Pale and emaciated, they are draped in the clothing that it themselves thin. Striped with worn, faded tine.

 Slowly, each in turn begins to lighten, gain weight, their skin regains color, as the rippling fabric settles over them like a shroud, then a blanket. The host that she has woven settles upon them like comfort.

Relief. Heat and love.

My chest swells with a feeling that is too large for my body as I watch her kindness manifest in the transformation of these strangers, coasting over the world like sunlight.

I reach out to touch the fabric that still darts between them, feeling the whisper of cool silk against my skin. In that moment, I am one with her, one with each person she has touched, for I understand now. Kindness, like a miracle, is the greatest magic of all. 

The scene begins to fade as I awake, the echo of her gentle words still ringing in my ears. "Money, food, these are things you can steal, bribe, force. But kindness? No. You must give, but also accept. It requires two, and both are changed forever. Sewed together for eternity."

I lay there, stirring, the fabric soft as a lover's caress against my skin. I am awash in feelings.

And I am changed.
