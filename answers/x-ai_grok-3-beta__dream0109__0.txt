I am dreaming. As I awaken in this dream, a peculiar sensation washes over me, like the feeling of sinking upward, defying all sense of gravity I’ve ever known. My eyes flutter open to a world that shimmers with an otherworldly glow, a civilization perched on the edge of impossibility. The sky above is not a dome of blue or a canvas of stars, but a swirling vortex of liquid gold, rippling as if an unseen hand stirs it with languid grace. The ground beneath my bare feet is not solid earth but a mosaic of pulsating, translucent clouds, soft as silk yet firm enough to bear my weight. Each step sends ripples outward, as if I’m walking on the surface of a dream itself.

This is a civilization built on principles and physical laws that defy everything I’ve ever understood. Here, time flows not in a straight line but in spirals, looping backward and forward in mesmerizing, unpredictable dances. I watch in awe as a child ages into an elder in mere moments, only to laugh with a youthful giggle and shrink back into infancy, reborn in a cycle of seconds. Gravity, too, is a fickle friend—objects drift upward lazily, as if drawn to the golden vortex above, only to plummet back down when they please, following no discernible rule. Buildings are not constructed of stone or steel but of shimmering thoughts, their walls shifting and reforming with the emotions of those who dwell within. A house of joy glows with radiant amber, while one of sorrow weeps gentle streams of silver liquid that pool at its base before evaporating into whispers of melody.

I stand at the heart of this paradoxical society, a stranger in a body that feels both mine and not mine. My reflection in a nearby puddle of mirrored mist shows me not as I am in waking life, but as a being of light, my edges blurred, my form shimmering with every breath. The inhabitants of this world approach me, their forms as fluid as the laws that govern this place. They are not human in the way I know, but entities of energy and intention, their voices resonating not in sound but in waves of color that bloom in my mind like flowers unfurling in spring. “Welcome, Seeker of Inversion,” they hum, their greeting a cascade of violet and teal that washes over me with warmth. “To belong, you must unlearn.”

To integrate into this society, I must shed the rigid frameworks of my waking mind. They guide me to a great spiral of glass—no, not glass, but frozen time—that towers at the city’s center, a structure known as the Uncore. Here, I am to surrender my linear understanding of reality. I step into the spiral, and instantly, my memories fracture and reform. I see my past not as a chain of events but as a constellation, each moment a star I can pluck from the sky and rearrange. I laugh as I hold my first heartbreak in my hands, a cold, jagged crystal, and toss it into the vortex above, watching it dissolve into a burst of emerald sparks. In its place, I craft a new memory—a moment of flight through a forest of upside-down trees, their roots reaching for the golden sky.

Next, I am taught to speak in their language of color and emotion. I focus on a memory of joy—a childhood day spent chasing fireflies—and project it outward. A burst of sunshine yellow explodes from my chest, swirling around me like a ribbon of light. The beings nod, their own hues flickering in approval, and respond with a tapestry of crimson and indigo, a story of loss and renewal that I feel in the marrow of my bones. Language here is not a barrier but a bridge, a shared painting of the soul.

To live among them, I must also master their dance of gravity. They lead me to a field of floating obsidian spheres, each humming with a different tone. I leap, expecting to fall, but instead, I hover, my body twisting and turning as if caught in an unseen current. “Intend your path,” they urge, and I do. I will myself toward a sphere, and it draws me in, wrapping me in a cocoon of sound that vibrates through my being. I learn to move not by force but by desire, gliding through this world as if I am both wind and feather.

Days—or what I perceive as days—pass in this dreamscape, though time’s spiral makes it impossible to count. I build my own dwelling from thoughts of serenity, a shimmering dome of aquamarine that hums with the lullaby of ocean waves. I trade stories with my new kin, exchanging bursts of color for their tales of inverted wars fought with peace instead of weapons, and feasts where hunger is sated not by food but by shared laughter that blooms into tangible light.

Yet, even as I weave myself into the fabric of this society, a quiet ache lingers in my core—a whisper of the world I left behind. I stand at the edge of the cloud-mosaic one non-day, gazing into the golden vortex above, and ponder if I am truly unlearning or merely dreaming within a dream. But then a wave of violet washes over me, a friend’s greeting, and I turn back, my light-form pulsing with the rhythm of this impossible place. For now, I belong to the paradox, a citizen of inversion, dancing in spirals of time and color, forever unmoored from the laws I once knew.
