I am dreaming. ....

As I settle into the hard plastic chair in this vast examination hall, a peculiar sensation washes over me. The fluorescent lights above flicker with an otherworldly pulse, casting strange shadows that seem to dance across my exam paper. As I look down at the questions, my heart nearly stops – the text before me is written in an impossible script that seems to shift and transform like living creatures.

The letters crawl across the page like iridescent insects, rearranging themselves into patterns that somehow make perfect sense yet are completely incomprehensible. Some questions appear to be written upside down, while others spiral into infinite fractals that extend deep into the paper itself, as if the page has become a portal to another dimension.

When I glance up, I notice the other students in the hall have begun to float gently from their seats, their bodies suspended in mid-air as they continue writing with serene expressions. Their pencils leave trails of golden light that hang in the air like cosmic dust. The walls of the examination hall have become transparent, revealing a swirling cosmos beyond – stars being born and dying, galaxies spinning in eternal dance.

The clock at the front of the room no longer shows numbers but instead displays abstract symbols that pulse with vibrant colors. Time itself seems to flow like honey, sometimes rushing forward in great surges, other times crawling backward like waves receding from a shore.

My pencil has transformed into a small silver bird that writes answers in my handwriting, but everything it writes turns into butterflies that flutter away before I can read them. I can feel knowledge flowing through me like electricity, but it's knowledge of things I've never learned – the language of trees, the dreams of stones, the mathematics of starlight.

The exam questions continue to evolve, now asking about the sound of colors and the taste of music. Somehow, in this dream-logic, these impossible questions make perfect sense, and I find myself writing answers that feel profoundly true despite their absurdity...
