I am dreaming. It's a vivid, lucid dream that feels so real. I am in a crowded place, the smell of sweat and excitement in the air. Everything seems normal until I notice something amiss. The crowd starts to shift, murmur, and then panic. The atmosphere changes drastically as people start screaming and running for their lives. 

I survey the area quickly, trying to decipher what's happening. Suddenly, a massive wave rises from below, engulfing everything in its path. The ground beneath my feet shakes violently, causing buildings to crumble and people to topple like dominos. The water rises higher and higher, reaching rooftops and swallowing entire streets.

I am alone now, floating on a piece of debris amidst utter chaos. Cars, trees, and buildings float by, torn apart by the force of the water. Helicopters buzz overhead, their blades slicing through the air as they try to rescue survivors.

As I'm drifting aimlessly, I see a group of people climbing onto a massive whale, which is swimming towards higher ground. I swim towards them, my arms and legs aching from exhaustion. The whale slows down when it notices me and opens its mouth to allow me in.

Inside the whale's mouth, it's surprisingly spacious and dry. The walls are covered in colorful patterns, and the light filtering through the skin casts an ethereal glow. The whale's heartbeat is steady and reassuring, and I can feel the earthquakes and tsunamis shrinking in my memory.

We ride the whale to safety, gasping for air and trembling from the experience. As we land on dry land, we look back at the devastation left behind. More than half of the city is underwater, and rescue efforts are still ongoing. I wake up, relieved to find that it was just a dream but also shaken by the vividness of it all.
