I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of ozone and pine—sharp, electric. I've qualified for the championship, though no one expected it. Least of all me.

The competition is *Lucid Gauntlet*, a contest myth has whispered about in hushed awe across a thousand realities: part battle royale, part chess match cast in the architecture of dreams themselves. It's a game where the mind battles as fiercely as the body, where blood and strategy intertwine beneath a sky that shifts with the dreams of the living. Most who enter never return—pulled into dreamscapes so vivid, so dangerous, they forget they ever had another life.

I stand at the edge of a fissured coliseum gathered from broken stars and echoes of ancient jungles, the ground beneath me a mosaic of glimmering stone etched with runes that glow and pulse like heartbeats. Above, impossibly vast, a fractured moon floats lazily through the sky, each piece rotating in mysterious syncopation, like a clockwork universe trapped in glass.

My opponents wait. They are nightmares made flesh—warriors honed in hyper-real academies, draped in biotechnologies that run on soul-memory physics, their bodies adaptive machines sculpted by generations of elite conditioning. They carry weapons forged in black hole crucibles, breathing in light like smoke and expelling storms.

I have none of that. I have sweat and instinct, the raw edge of emotion, and something *else*—a whisper inside me, the last gift from my forgotten dream-mentor: the *Song of Activation*, a melody vibrating just under the threshold of hearing that I sometimes hum in my sleep.

The tournament is not won solely by the sword or mind, but by the *weaver*—the rare competitor who can manipulate the dream structure itself. I don't yet know how to fully bend the Lucid Gauntlet to my will. But sometimes, in moments of pure emotional tipping—love, terror, despair—the world splinters and *bends*. And I begin to see the stitches of the dream.

My first round begins in the *Hymnarena*, where the air sings if you bleed. I'm pitted against a pair of combatants: Valen the Hollow, a knife-dancer forged from obsidian and grief; and Elari, a sentient puppet whose strings are pulled by a choir of inner voices harmonizing with the battlefield.

I evade their first strikes, ducking into the undergrowth of a jungle that flickers in and out of focus, only semi-formed. The arena changes with each heartbeat—an ancient Mayan ziggurat becomes a colossal library suspended in zero-g blackness. I fall forward—no gravity—and swim through books screaming history as they autodigest in midair. Elari follows, nimble, whispering future strategies I somehow half-remember.

It’s then I recall: she’s lived this battle a hundred times in her dream loops.

My body is tired. My soul aches.

But suddenly, I feel something rumbling within—not rage, but memory. My own. Waking memory. Bits and shards of lives lived in parallel. Training in rooftop gardens beneath violet auroras, falling in love with a stranger whose face my dream forgets every dawn, standing shoulder to shoulder with allies I can’t name but will always fight for.

The memory fuels something ancient inside me—a conduit. I sing the Song of Activation, and the battlefield trembles. The books freeze, their screaming silenced. Gravity chooses my side. Elari falters. Valen’s blade bends.

Time scatters.

Each competitor, each stage, becomes more surreal. In the *Garden of Hundred Clocks*, I duel a seven-year-old prodigy who knows every version of the game ten minutes before it happens. In the *Well Between Words*, I outwit a lawyer-mage whose sentences are chains that rewrite the combat rules midfight.

I learn: that joy is lances of stardust, that fear can be worn as armor. That the dream remembers courage more clearly than skill.

And finally…

The final round.

My opponent?

Myself.

The Dream Weave flares—a great palimpsest of all my possible endings and beginnings, each one shimmering like a leaf in wind. It’s me, but reforged by "what-ifs": the version who took the forbidden path, the shadowed me who turned away from the light and became king.

It is a duel of conviction.

We meet in the Eye of Non
