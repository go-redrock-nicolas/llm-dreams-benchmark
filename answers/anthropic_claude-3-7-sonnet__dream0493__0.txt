I am dreaming. I find myself waking on a spiraling staircase of weathered copper, its patina surface cool beneath my fingertips. The stairs wind both upward and downward into misty uncertainty, seemingly without beginning or end. Each step glimmers with tiny constellations that shift when I'm not directly observing them.

The air carries the scent of rain-soaked earth and distant cinnamon, though no storm clouds are visible through the enormous stained-glass windows that float independently alongside the staircase. Each window depicts scenes that change when I turn to look at them directlyâ€”forests becoming oceans, mountains transforming into sprawling cities of impossible architecture.

I notice a small mechanical bird perched on the railing. Its feathers are crafted from thin sheets of translucent amber, and its eyes contain miniature clockworks that tick in rhythm with my heartbeat. It opens its beak and speaks in a voice that sounds like my childhood memories:

"The answers you seek are written in the books you haven't opened yet."

The bird takes flight, leaving behind a trail of luminescent particles that coalesce into a doorway made of rippling water. Through it, I glimpse a vast library where the bookshelves curve and bend like living things. Knowledge seems to hum in the air there, palpable and inviting.

As I reach toward the liquid threshold, my fingers cause ripples that spread outward, carrying fragments of forgotten conversations and half-remembered faces across its surface. I step through, feeling the cool passage of possibility washing over me...
