I am dreaming. The world in my dream is a kaleidoscope of shifting colors and melodies. I'm standing on a glass bridge that stretches endlessly in both directions, each pane reflecting not just my face but different versions of myself—some younger, others wiser, all wearing outfits that seem to change with every step I take. Beneath me, the air is alive with geometric shapes that hum in harmonies I haven't yet named. A voice, neither male nor female, whispers, *“Choose a reflection to guide you.”* 

To my left, a version of myself in a flowing cerulean gown offers a hand, her eyes holding the calm of ancient seas. To my right, another me in a spacesuit of shimmering gold laughs, pointing at constellations that pulse in time with my heartbeat. Ahead, a third figure in a charcoal-gray trench coat beckons from a door cut into the sky, its handle a swirling galaxy. 

I hesitate, each option pulling at me with invisible threads. The cerulean self sings of diving into depths where time doesn’t exist, of answers buried in silent, sandy canyons. The golden astronaut promises voyages where gravity is a myth and stars are portals to uncharted symphonies. The gray-clad figure murmurs of thresholds, of choices that weigh like anvils but must be made anyway. 

The bridge begins to ripple, the glass softening like molten silver. I reach out—toward whom? The decision trembles in my chest, a live wire between heart and reason. Whispers crescendo—*constancy, courage, conscience*—as the path below dissolves into stardust.
