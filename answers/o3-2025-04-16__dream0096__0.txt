I am dreaming. …draw a ragged breath and force yourself to look closer—because you realize the only way out is through.

The space around you is a vast, echoing cathedral of shifting shadows, as if the walls are stitched together from nightmares you’ve half-forgotten. Every pillar is carved from memories: here, the creak of your childhood attic stair; there, the hum of fluorescent lights in a long-abandoned hallway. The floor is an obsidian mirror that ripples underfoot, reflecting a fractured version of you that moves a half-heartbeat out of sync.

Your greatest fear has taken shape at the far end of the nave. It isn’t a monster with claws or teeth; it’s a colossal, looming hourglass, its upper globe crammed with brilliant grains of light—moments you still hope to live. With every second, those grains slip away, cascading into the lower globe, each spark dimming as it falls. Time itself is draining, and you can feel its pull, cold and insistent, tugging at your chest like a tide.

Panic surges—tight, electrifying, clammy. Your breath comes in short bursts, fogging the air with shards of frost. An unseen choir begins to chant in a language you’ve never heard but instantly understand: the words are fragments of deadlines missed, promises broken, opportunities lost. Their echo multiplies until it feels like a waterfall of clocks, tick after tick after tick, threatening to drown out every thought.

But then, a pulse rises from deep inside your ribs—steady, stubborn, and bright. You remember something: the tiny, ember-warm realization that you are dreaming, and dreams are malleable.

You plant your feet on the mirror-floor. It trembles. Fine cracks spiderweb outward, scattering kaleidoscopic prismatic light. You lift one hand—only a gesture, but in this realm of molten possibility it’s enough. The air thickens, swirling around your fingers like luminous paint in water. You imagine a key made of sunrise: rosy gold, whispering with the hush of dawn. It coalesces into your palm.

The hourglass bellows, a thunderous groan of shifting sand. Everything in you screams to flee, yet you stride forward. Every step makes the cathedral distort: pews fold into origami cranes and take flight; stained-glass windows liquefy into shimmering waterfalls of color; star-shaped lanterns burst from the ceiling and orbit you like fireflies.

At the base of the hourglass, you see a keyhole that didn’t exist a moment before—your willpower has summoned it. You fit the sunrise key into the lock. The metal is warm, pulsing with a heartbeat that mirrors your own. You turn it.

Instantly, time stalls mid-cascade. The falling grains glow brighter, freezing in a glittering spiral above your head. Silence falls, deeper than any hush you’ve ever known—so profound it’s almost musical. You feel the weight of your fear dangling, suspended, waiting to see what you choose.

With calm you didn’t know you possessed, you reach up and tap the glass. It softens under your fingertips like molten sugar. You swirl your hand, sculpting the trapped light into new constellations. Instead of slipping away, each grain blossoms into a miniature world: a friend’s laughter, a path through cedar trees, the taste of salt on a night breeze, an idea that might yet change everything. You guide them, not down but outward, releasing the sparks to orbit you like a cosmic halo.

The cathedral shudders and then sighs, dissolving into a dawn-pink horizon. The mirror-floor becomes still water; gentle ripples carry golden reflections of each freed moment. And the hourglass melts into a harmless pool of honey-bright sand, warm beneath your bare feet.

You breathe, long and deep. The choir is gone. The ticking has vanished. What remains is your own heartbeat, steady as a drum, echoing across an endless sky.

A whisper drifts through the glowing air—your own voice, older and younger all at once: “Fear is only the shape your power wears before you claim it.”

As the dream softens, you feel yourself rising toward waking. Yet you know the embers of what you forged here will come with you: the sunrise key glowing in your chest, and every grain of time you reclaimed now glimmering, weightless, yours.
