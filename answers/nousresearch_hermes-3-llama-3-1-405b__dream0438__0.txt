I am dreaming. I'm on a road trip with one of my friends. I have saved up enough money to take this trip, and we are traveling across the country to see the sights. But instead of driving across the desert, we're diving into the earth's deepest depths. It's a warm day, and I can feel the sun's warmth on the car, and the cool air from the car's AC.



We pull off the road to a rest stop to stretch our legs, and as I step out of the car, I'm hit with a sudden cold wind that seems to pass right through my body. It's invigorating, unlike the smothering heat of the desert. This is the moment I realize I'm dreaming.

We continue along the road, and the scenery begins to change. Everything transforms into a path of large, vibrant flowers that emit a brilliant, unearthly light, bathing everything in a soft glow. We're surrounded by lush vegetation, and I hear a waterfall nearby. We get out of the car and start running through the field, feeling free and alive.


As we reach the waterfall's edge, I realize that it's crystal clear and displays an array of colors that I've never seen before. The combination of hues is mesmerizing, and I can't stop staring at it. My friend and I decide to swim, and once we're in the water, it feels like our bodies are being enveloped in a warm, comforting embrace.


Underneath the water's surface, we see a hidden cave. We swim into it, and the cave's walls seem to shimmer and emit a soft light. It's like we're swimming in a different world. As we dive deeper, an array of beautiful fish, with vibrant colors and patterns that I've never seen before, swim around us. They're not afraid; rather, they come up close to check us out as if we're one of them. We continue swimming through the cave, and a sense of peace and calm washes over me. It's like I'm one with the water, and all my fears and anxieties seem to dissolve.


After a while, we emerge from the cave, and the sun is setting, casting brilliant colors across the sky. We get back to the car and return to the road. As we drive, the sky grows darker, and the stars shine brighter than I've ever seen them before. We arrive at a cliff overlooking the ocean, and the moon's reflection on the water is a brilliant silver that takes my breath away. We sit in silence, watching the waves crash against the shore, feeling completely at peace.


As I gaze at the ocean, my mind drifts to my anxieties and concerns. But somehow, they no longer feel overwhelming. Instead, I see them for what they are - just thoughts, not reality. And in that moment, I realize that the journey I'm taking is unlike any other. It's not just a trip across the country, but a journey into my soul, discovering hidden depths I didn't know existed. And despite the challenges I've faced, I realize that I am resilient, strong, and capable of overcoming anything that life throws my way.


The dream ends, but the lessons remain. I wake up feeling healed, whole, and ready to face the day.
