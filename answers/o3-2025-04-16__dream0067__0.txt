I am dreaming. …standing in a hospital corridor that is impossibly long and lined with doors made of stained glass, each one glowing from within as if lit by its own gentle sunrise. The doctor’s words—“months, not years”—still echo behind your ribs like a second, secret heartbeat, but here in the dream they have transformed into a kind of tolling bell that chimes somewhere above your head, soft, distant, undeniably beautiful.

A breath escapes you, and the corridor ripples. The polished floor becomes a mirrored river, reflecting not fluorescent ceiling lights but a midnight sky thick with constellations. You step onto the surface; it holds you as if welcoming a familiar traveler. With every footfall, distant galaxies swirl under your shoes, and the bell’s toll turns into music—an orchestra of memories humming out of time.

One stained-glass door swings inward. You’re drawn through.

Now you are standing on a cliff of ivory chalk overlooking an ocean the color of melted sapphire. At the water’s edge, enormous hourglasses rise and fall with the tide, their crystal chambers filled with sand that glitters like powdered moonlight. Each hourglass bears a name carved into its frame—people you’ve loved, people you lost, fleeting moments you’ve forgotten. You find yours near the shoreline, its neck narrowing, grains already trickling down. For a second, panic squeezes your ribs. But then the sea wind catches the sand, lifting it in spirals of gold that dissolve into luminescent fireflies. Time, it seems, knows how to dance.

Behind you, a carousel appears, painted in hues that only dreams know: prismatic greens, silvers tinged with lavender, reds that taste of pomegranate seeds. Instead of horses, the poles hold memories. There’s the bicycle you rode at seven, bent wheel and all; the bandaged finger from your first kitchen mishap; a university dorm window flung open to let in snow. Each memory beckons. You choose the dented bicycle and straddle it—instantly you’re flying, the carousel spinning you upward, above the cliff, through clouds the texture of whipped cream.

The clouds part like curtains, revealing a vast library suspended in darkness. Shelves drift on currents of starlight, stacked with books bound in living bark, scales, feathers. You float between aisles while the air smells of rain on hot pavement. A librarian approaches—an elderly woman with eyes that resemble distant quasars. She presses a book into your hands. Its cover is blank, but inside, every page is filled with pulsing lines of light. “This is the story of the days you still have,” she whispers. “It is not written in ink, but in choices.” The book feels warm, as if alive.

You look up to ask a question, but the library is gone. Instead, you stand in your childhood bedroom. Moonlight splashes across carpet strewn with toy rockets and crayons. A younger version of yourself sits cross-legged on the bed, staring at the same luminous book. He looks up, eyes enormous with anticipation, and asks, “Are you afraid?” The question unzips something in your chest. You kneel, meet his gaze, and find your voice calm. “Yes,” you admit, “but I’m also curious.” Little-you grins, and in that grin is all the courage you didn’t know you carried.

Thunder rumbles. The walls dissolve into a night festival along a river that glows neon teal. Lanterns drift overhead—each one shaped like a heart, a lung, a brain, organs turned to origami set alight. Crowds dressed in kaleidoscopic silks swirl around you, singing languages you understand without ever learning. Someone presses a lantern into your palm: it resembles your own heart, translucent, beating softly. You set it on the river. It bobs away, joining hundreds of others, a flotilla of luminous hope drifting toward the horizon where dawn is already burning gold.

The sun rises like a slow-motion cymbal crash, and the festival fades into a quiet hilltop. Wildflowers sway, releasing petals that twirl up instead of down, creating an inverted snowfall. You sit among them, the unfinished, glowing book open on your lap. A fountain pen materializes beside it, its ink shimmering like liquid prism. Overhead, a voice—not ominous but warm, intimate—whispers: “You have less time than you hoped, but more life than you know. Write.”

You lift the pen. The hill, the sky, the entire dream holds its breath.

A single word blooms on the blank page, spreading color through the lines of light: Begin.

The petals pause midair, the bell in your chest rings once, and you understand that the dream is a doorway, not an ending. You lean into the page, ready to script whatever comes next. Somewhere far off, in the realm of waking, morning light begins to spill across your real bedroom floor. But for one more heartbeat, you stay exactly here—ink poised, soul alight—beginning.
