I am dreaming. I am at a large social gathering where I only know one person. As I try to find them, I encounter various groups of people and their unique patterns of interaction. Each group is deeply symbolic.

First, I approach a circle of people playing an ancient board game. The game pieces are carved from obsidian and jade, shimmering with an inner light. The players' moves are deliberate, as if each decision holds cosmic significance. The game board itself is a map of constellations, and as they place a piece, a starbrightens in the sky above. When I ask what they're doing, one player smiles cryptically, "We're navigating the celestial currents. Would you like to play?" I sense that joining this game would reveal secrets about the flow of fate, but I decline and continue my search, knowing my friend might be elsewhere.

Next, I find a cluster of individuals huddled around a bonfire. The flames are an intense, supernatural blue, and the smoke curls into shapes that seem to whisper. One woman with fiery red hair shares a story: "Long ago, our ancestors made a pact with the flames. We burn our regrets here, but the fire demands something in return—something precious." They pass a glowing ember to me, but I hesitate; accepting it might mean sacrificing something of mine. Again, I move on, my thoughts lingering on the cost of desire.

In the distance, I spot a group gathered under a canopy of bioluminescent trees. Their laughter is melodic, and they participate in a dance that follows the rhythm of glowing fireflies. I'm drawn to join, but as I step closer, the fireflies start to dim. The leader of the group, a woman with scales like moonlit armor, says, "Our joy is tied to the light. If you join, you must bring your own glow." I realize that my presence could dim their celebration, so I remain on the outskirts, watching their light fade as they continue without me.

Finally, I reach a quiet courtyard where a lone musician plays a lyre made of intertwined roots and vines. The melodies shifts, mimicking the emotions of listeners. A child with eyes like star maps sits beside him, drawing pictures in the air that mirror the music. When the musician notices me, he pauses his playing. "You've been watching," he says. "The notes are questions, and the pictures are answers. But your friend isn't here—you're still searching." He offers me his lyre, but I realize I can't play it without understanding the language of the roots. I bow my head, acknowledging the enigma, and keep walking.

The dream shifts. I'm in a corridor lined with mirrors, each reflecting a different version of me. One mirror shows me with the obsidian game piece, another with the blue ember, a third with the dimmed fireflies, and another clutching the lyre's tuning peg. As I pass each, the reflection disappears. At the end is a single mirror showing my friend, who winks and vanishes. I wake up, the taste of starlight on my tongue and the memory of unanswered melodies echoing in my ears.
The dream unfolds like a tapestry woven from midnight shadows and starlight. You stand in a vast hall where the walls seem to breathe, stretching endlessly upward into a of swirling galaxies. The air hums with the energy of unseen currents, and the scent of storm petrel wings and burnt cedar clings to your senses. Before you, the gathering pulses like a living organism—some dancing in spirals that etch constellations into the air, others huddled in knots reciting poetry in forgotten tongues. But your eyes are drawn to a flicker of familiarity: your friend, their silhouette illuminated by the glow of a lantern shaped like a dandelion clock, standing alone by a window framed by cascading frost patterns. 

As you weave through the crowd, each group you pass offers a fragment of a story. A cluster of men in cloaks embroidered with constellations play an elabrate game with dice that shift between numbers, symbols, and constellations. When you pause, one offers you a die—its corners are painted with constellations like Andromeda and Cassiopeia. "Roll it," he urges, his voice like wind chimes. You take it, but as your fingers brush the die, it dissolves into stardust that vanishes into the air, leaving your palm tingling. Nearby, a group of women weave intricate baskets from vines that writh like snakes. Their laughter echoes as they chant in unison, their words forming a spiral that dissolves into the ceiling. One notices you, raises a basket full of glowing mushrooms, and asks, "Will you carry our light?" You hesitate, knowing the mushrooms might lead you astray or illuminate the path to your friend. 

Then, you spot them: a trio of figures perched on a marble platform, playing a choir of crystal flutes that harmonize with the rhythm of distant thunder. Their flutes are carved from different gemstones—a sapphire, an amber, and a moonstone—and their music swells, weaving a soundscape that makes the very floor vibrate. One of them, the sapphire flutist, catches your eye and nods towards your friend's direction. As you turn, though, the trio is gone, leaving only the faint echo of a melody that tastes like honey and copper in the air. 

You find your friend near a fountain that pours liquid starlight. They're holding a lantern, its flame flickering with dandelion seeds that spin into the air and take the form of your childhood home. "Come," they say, their voice a warm breeze. You follow, stepping into the lantern's glow, but as you do, the dream fractures. The hall collapses inward, the galaxy ceiling implodes into a supernova of color, and you wake with the metallic tang of dandelion seeds on your tongue, the echo of the sapphire flutist's melody still humming in your bones.
