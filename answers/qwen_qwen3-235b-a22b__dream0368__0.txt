I am dreaming. The sky is not a sky at all, but a vast, slowly turning kaleidoscope smeared with pigments too radiant for any earthly light. Swirls of violet and gold ripple across infinity like brushstrokes on divine canvas. Each breath is tinged with the scent of menthol leaves and ancient citrus—so crisp, so clean, that my lungs hum softly in gratitude.

I’m standing at the edge of a world that was once cluttered and roaring with sound—sirens, voices, clatter, ambition—but now, it is silent. Not empty, just… quiet. The silence of deep snow. The hush of something sacred letting go.

I feel it inside me now more than ever: the undeniable *pull* toward simplification—no, not the minimalist kind of tidy surfaces and minimal possessions alone. No. This is spiritual surgery. A peeling away of the nonessential.

I lift my hand and watch it shimmer. Skin translucent, bones lit from within like glass filled with moonlight. Every dream-realm muscle is stripped of excess, every imagined cell sloughed of its distraction. Here, I see what clung too long: ambitions like loose thread pulling me into chaos, obligations that were not true callings, emotions stained by crowded hours and shallow interactions.

Around me, the world begins to dissolve—not violently, but with profound tenderness. The high towers of forgotten cities fold inward like paper cranes surrendering to the wind. Trees bow low, roots easing out of soil with quiet moans, becoming outlines in air before vanishing. Even sorrow lets go—gracefully, like water letting a stone sink.

Then I am walking, barefoot over a mirrored plain that is not quite land, not quite sky. Each step echoes farther than the last, as if my footprints create ripples through all dimensions. Beneath me, I see reflections of past selves: jogging through busy mornings, drowning in pixels and passwords, trapped in the velvet cage of expectations like soft chains around my wrists.

But here, I burn it all down. Not with rage, but with clarity. Flames in this place are pale and kind. They return everything to ash without screaming, return all things to essence. A library of old routines, a wardrobe of false identities, a banquet hall of hollow conversations—all are reduced to their atomic truths. The fire only eats illusion. Everything real sparkles in the embers, undamaged.

Suddenly, a figure appears on the horizon—not man or woman, but a shimmering embodiment of the present moment, swathed in wavering silk made of wind itself. The being says nothing, only raises one hand that opens to reveal a basket of pulsating lights.

I approach, the ground softening beneath my steps like memory foam made from mist. I reach into the basket. One light jumps into my palm. It pulses once, twice—and I see. Inside it, the core of everything I was searching for: *Presence*. Stillness. Attention. Connection. Not to goals or outcomes, but to this eternal now.

The dreamscape begins to re-form, governed now by one simple vow: *Only what is real has any value.*

A single tree grows from the plain. It bears no fruit, no flowers, no script on its bark—but its leaves are made of song. Each breeze through its branches weaves symphonies that are experienced more deeply than heard.

I sit beneath it, and the world no longer calls to me. It no longer needs to.

Here, in the quiet of the shimmer and the hush of all that matters, I finally answer not what I must do—but what I am. And I breathe, free. Simple. Whole.
