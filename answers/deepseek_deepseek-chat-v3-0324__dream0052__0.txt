I am dreaming. The world around me shimmers like liquid gold, the air thick with the scent of jasmine and damp earth. A voice—soft yet unshakable—whispers the news, and it lands in my chest like a stone dropped into still water. Ripples of shock, disbelief, and something else—something electric—spread through me, making my fingers tingle and my breath catch.  

The faces around me blur into a mosaic of wide eyes and parted lips, waiting. The ground beneath my feet feels unstable, as if the earth itself is holding its breath. For a heartbeat, I am weightless, suspended between the life I knew and the one that has just been unveiled before me. Then, like a storm breaking, warmth floods my veins—not fear, not yet, but a wild, untamed thrill. The kind that comes with standing at the edge of a cliff, knowing the fall could either shatter you or teach you to fly.  

I close my eyes, and when I open them again, the world has shifted. The sky is now a swirling canvas of indigo and violet, streaked with comets that hum as they pass. The wind carries voices—whispers of futures that could be, paths that branch and twist like vines. My pulse drums in my ears, a steady, defiant rhythm.  

And then, I smile. Not because the news is good or bad, but because it is *alive*—a living, breathing thing that has cracked open the shell of my old self. The onlookers lean in, but I am already turning away, stepping into the unknown, where the air smells like lightning and the horizon burns with possibility.
