I am dreaming. I realize I’m dreaming and find myself in a strange place. It’s nighttime, and there are no lights on except for some dim stars. I see a tall tower with a door open. Curiosity overcomes fear, and I decide to go inside the tower. As soon as I cross the threshold, darkness engulfs me, and I feel dizzy. Suddenly, I hear myself say “I am dreaming” several times in an echoing voice that sounds like it’s coming from all directions at once. Then, everything goes black again, for a few moments until you wake up.

You find yourself back in your bedroom with the dream device still glowing faintly next to you. You notice it has changed slightly since last time you saw it. There are now more buttons and switches on its surface, but they don’t seem to do anything when you try them. Maybe they will activate once you solve a problem?
