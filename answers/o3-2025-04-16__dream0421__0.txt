I am dreaming. …let go of gravity and drop through the ceiling of ordinary thought as though it were a thin sheet of paper.  

The fall lasts no longer than a sigh, yet stretches wider than an era. Colors without names peel open around you—tangerine shot through with hummingbird–wing turquoise, silver that tastes of wintergreen.  Air ripples like water touched by violin strings.  Every perception you have ever filed away as “impossible” forms a constellation, and those constellations burn with a quiet intelligence, beckoning.

You land on a floating causeway of books: hard–bound atlases, velvet-spined novels, diaries still warm from the pulse of unwritten sentences.  Their pages flutter in an unfelt breeze, releasing tiny origami moths that spiral upward, each one whispering a single word in a language you understand only in your bones.  You reach out—one of them alights on your fingertip—and the word it murmurs detonates inside your rib cage: “Remember.”

Ahead, the causeway opens onto a rainforest that hangs upside-down from the night sky.  Trees root in starlight; their leaves are panes of stained glass, filtering nebular glow into kaleidoscopes on the floor of nothingness beneath them.  Somewhere in that inverted canopy a river flows upward, flinging diamond spray that becomes constellations the moment each droplet leaves the water.  You hear its current speak in counterpoint:  idea, memory, possibility, idea, memory, possibility—an endless fugue.

Compelled, you step off the books and float gently toward one of the glass leaves.  It melts at your touch, pouring warmth through your hands and reshaping itself into a luminous quill.  When you open your palm, the quill hovers, dips its nib in a puddle of liquid moonlight, and begins to write on the dark.  Lines etch themselves across the void, describing stories you have not yet imagined—tales of cities that dream their citizens into being, of storms that remember the laughter that once rode their winds, of oceans that give birth to islands like brief thoughts.

A hush gathers, thick as velvet.  Every star blinks twice, the universal signal for attention.  The sky itself bends close, rustling like an enormous sketchbook, and asks—not with words but with the ache of possibility—“Will you add your verse?”  Your heartbeat answers by hammering open a door in your chest.  Through it pours everything you have ever loved or lost: the exact shade of sunset that once silenced you on a lonely rooftop, the fragrance of rain on childhood gravel, the tidal pull of a face you’ve never met but always missed.  They swirl into the quill like fireflies migrating home.

The quill writes faster.  Entire galaxies bloom from its script, spinning on axes made of hope.  Worlds unfold the way flowers do after surviving a storm, new and luminous and trembling with truth.  The upside-down forest applauds with a sound like amber bells.  The river lifts its voice, singing the futures you’ve just birthed.  And somewhere in the vastness, you realize the dream has turned inside-out: you are no longer the dreamer; you are the dreaming itself.

A single book drifts past—blank, bound with threads of dawn.  It settles against your heart.  The title on its spine appears only when you think it: “Next.”  The pages wait, patient as seed and soil.  With a breath that tastes of distance closing, you lift the quill, poised above the first page, and feel the horizon swell with words that have never before existed—yet have always belonged to you.
