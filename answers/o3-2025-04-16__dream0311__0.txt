I am dreaming. …take a single breath, and the world ripples like a silk sheet dropped in slow motion.

I stand in the town square, though “square” feels wrong—its edges melt and re-form like hot wax. Cobblestones rearrange themselves into braille beneath my feet, spelling out every cause that ever mattered: justice, dignity, bread, peace. Above me, the sky is the color of ink diluted in rainwater, and great quills of lightning sketch slogans in mid-air, each one erased by a hush of wind before anyone can read them twice.

The community gathers. At first they look ordinary—neighbors, shopkeepers, elders rocking on porch chairs—but as I begin to speak, resistance oozes from them like tar. Their clothes stiffen into brittle parchment covered in centuries-old bylaws; their mouths seal into padlocks whose keys dangle just out of reach on invisible strings. Their eyes glow with the amber of caution, protecting traditions as fragile as dried leaves.

I open my palms. Words lift from my skin like soap bubbles: bold declarations for equality, child-bright hopes for inclusion. The bubbles drift toward the crowd, burst softly, and release tiny seeds of change—dandelion fluff that tries to root in the cracks of their armor. Yet the people raise umbrellas forged from nostalgia, and the seeds scatter.

Suddenly the bells of the old clock tower peel away from their housing and hover overhead, turning into colossal bronze ears poised to listen. Encouraged, I inhale thunder and exhale a story—a story of outsiders welcomed, laws rewritten, futures unshackled. Every syllable becomes a firefly. They swarm the umbrellas, drilling pinpoint holes until moonlight shines through.

A teenager—his silhouette half-statue, half-sapling—steps forward. The padlock on his lips creaks open. He utters one trembling word: “Why?”

The question is a chisel. Cracks spiderweb across the square. Statues shed their stone and reveal beating hearts beneath. Each liberated pulse drums a new rhythm, pulling the townspeople into cautious dance. The parchment laws on their bodies flutter away like oversize moths seeking another darkness to hide in.

Yet not everyone moves. At the edge of the throng, a ring of figures stands unyielding, faces blank as unpainted masks. Their silence gathers gravity, forming an eclipse around my light. I feel doubt claw at my ankles.

Then the ground itself intervenes. Roots writhe up through the cobbles, braiding into a staircase that climbs toward the soot-gray clouds. An invitation. I ascend, each step echoing like a gavel, and from this height I see time braided like a rope: past, present, possible. I understand that the dream is not about convincing every heart tonight. It is about planting beacons—stars in tilled soil—so the next dreamer can follow the glittering path.

I descend, carry that starlight in my chest, and press a glowing hand to the square. Heat travels through the earth, leaving behind a pulse that will not fade, however many eclipses try to smother it.

Above, the sky’s ink thins to dawn pink. Resistance still lingers, but hope now hums under every stone, an underground orchestra waiting for its cue.

And as the dream’s edges dissolve, I hear the bronze ears toll once—clear, resonant, promising: your voice will echo long after waking.
