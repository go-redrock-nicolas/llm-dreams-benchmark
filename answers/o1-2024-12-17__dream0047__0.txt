I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

Beyond the edge of your vision, the horizon hums with a rose-gold glow, as if dawn were paused in a state of perpetual anticipation. The air is thick and velvet-soft, laden with the perfume of lilacs and a faint, almost ethereal hint of pine. High above, clouds shaped like drifting lily pads float in a luminescent sky of dusk and dawn melded together—twilight swirling in gentle, celestial patterns.

Suddenly, a hush falls. The trees around you seem to inhale and hold their breath. In the distance, beyond a small, glass-smooth lake, you make out a cluster of figures dressed in dazzling whites and muted silvers. Their eyes are turned upwards, reflecting a single, shimmering point high among the clouds. At first, it looks like a lone star, but as you watch, it grows brighter and plunges toward the earth, leaving behind a trail of sparks that shimmer like a comet’s tail.

All at once—impact. The sky flashes a color no language seems fit to describe, something between fiery pink and obsidian. A tremor ripples through the ground, and a shriek of sorrow resonates throughout the air. You realize it is coming from those around you: an anguished, collective gasp that morphs into trembling sobs. Some bury their faces in their hands, overcome with shock, while others collapse to their knees as though the weight of this calamity is greater than they can bear.

In the settling silence after the impact, you feel a twisting ache in your chest, as if your very soul vibrates with an old, unnamable grief. Your hands tremble; the heat from the comet’s explosion still tingles against your skin. And yet, while others wail and weep around you, you find yourself rooted in place, strangely composed—like a stalwart tree standing unwavering through a gale. Tears want to spill from your eyes, but something holds them at bay, a curious sense of calm coiling around your heart.

The destroyed point of impact emits faint arcs of silver and gold, swirling like roiling smoke. You step closer, each footstep soft against the ground, as if you’re treading upon whispers. Weeping bystanders reach out as you pass, but you feel guided by an inexplicable certainty, something urging you forward. The closer you draw, the more you sense a silent plea emanating from the shattered remains—waves of longing, halos of luminous sorrow.

And then you see it: at the very center of the impact site lies the source of this tragedy—some sort of crystalline crater, still glowing with a dying light. You peer into its depths and discern a faint pulse, as though the crater itself possesses a broken, laboring heartbeat. It pulses just often enough to remind you that even in ruin, there can be a thrum of life.

Guided by the quiet bravery that has overtaken you, you reach out your hand, the silver glow tracing your fingertips. Hope erupts in your chest, mingling with grief and confusion—a kaleidoscope of emotion unlike anything you’ve known. Around you, sobbing fades, replaced by awe and uncertain curiosity. It feels like the entire dream is watching, holding its breath, waiting to see what you will do.

Gently, you lay your palm upon the fractured crystal. A swirl of warmth climbs up your arm, winding like a vine around your shoulders and down into your heart. A hauntingly serene melody echoes in your mind, resonating from this mysterious source. The crowd behind you remains breathless; their raw sorrow momentarily forgotten as they witness your communion with this wounded dreamscape.

You do not speak aloud, but in your thoughts a desperate wish forms: that restoration is possible, that the wretchedness of the moment is not the end of this story. Immediately, a pale, shimmering light flares beneath your hand. It spreads across the crater’s surface, sealing it, mending cracks. In a rush of color—lavenders, golds, saffrons, and milky whites—flowers seem to erupt across the ground, carpeting what was moments ago a scene of devastation.

And as the final pulses of light ribbon through the sky, you look up. The once-falling star dims but does not vanish; instead, it becomes a tiny spark fluttering overhead, ready to be reborn. In your chest, you feel the lingering tremors of sorrow, as a reminder of the power and weight of tragedy—even in dreams. But there is hope as well, vibrant and insistent, humming like a hidden chorus that refuses to be silenced.

Still in your reverie, you turn to face those who have wept beside you. They stare in disbelief at the fragile blossoms, at the faint sparks of light sifting from the sky. Their tears have not evaporated, but their sobs have gentled into hushed sighs. You sense the bond you now share: all of you witnessed devastation, and yet together you coaxed renewal from the ashes.

In that bloom of collective comfort, you finally realize—this dream belongs to you, but echoes in every heart around you. It is a realm shaped by sorrow and, ultimately, transformed by hope. And in this realization, you stand within the twilight sky, tears rimming your eyes, not from despair alone, but from the courage and gentleness you have discovered in the face of tragedy.

Shadows flicker, the scenery shifts, and you find yourself on the edge of waking. The memory of that whispering crater’s glow lingers in your heart, a promise that even the deepest wounds might someday beckon renewal. And as your breathing changes, slow and steady in the dawn, the dream’s final image remains: crystal mended, flowers blooming, and you standing tall, holding onto light in the midst of loss.
