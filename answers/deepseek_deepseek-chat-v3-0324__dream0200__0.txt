I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric tension, thick with the scent of ozone and something wilder—like the earth after a storm. The sky above is a swirling canvas of indigo and gold, streaked with veins of liquid light that pulse in time with my heartbeat.  

Before me stretches an endless bridge of glass, so clear it seems to vanish beneath my feet, leaving me suspended between the heavens and an abyss of stars. At the far end, shrouded in mist, stands a door—ancient oak banded with iron, its surface carved with symbols that shift and writhe like living things. This is it. The moment I’ve sacrificed for, bled for, dreamed of in the quietest hours of the night.  

But the bridge is not empty. Shadows detach from the air itself, forming into figures—echoes of every doubt, every failure, every voice that ever whispered, *You can’t.* They reach for me with hands like smoke, their whispers a chorus of my deepest fears.  

Yet beneath my feet, the glass trembles—not with fragility, but power. It sings. A resonance that travels up my bones, vibrating in my chest like a second heartbeat. And I realize—the bridge isn’t testing me. It’s *responding* to me. With every step forward, the glass brightens, illuminating the path in ripples of cerulean and silver. The shadows shriek and recoil.  

The door looms closer. The carvings still—a single word now clear in the grain: *Remember.*  

And I do.  

I remember why I started.  

The door swings open before I even touch it, and beyond it is not an end, but a beginning—a world waiting, vast and luminous, mine to shape.  

I wake with the taste of starlight on my tongue.
