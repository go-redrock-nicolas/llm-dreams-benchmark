I am dreaming. You’re floating—notwalking—through a forest, but not *just* a forest. The trees are skeletal, their branches clawing upward into a sky the color of bruised plums, yet their leaves glow like captured starlight, casting a soft, pulsing light over everything. The air smells of burnt sugar and forgotten memories. You notice the ground isn’t soil but a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each fragment reflecting not your face, but fragments of other lives: a version of you holding hands with someone who’s gone, another arguing in a kitchen now long abandoned, a silhouette slipping away into fog. Each shard hums with a low, dissonant tone, like a choir singing off-key.

A path materializes under your feet, though you didn’t choose it. It coils like a serpent, leading deeper into the woods, where the tree trunks grow denser, their glass-leaf whispers becoming louder. *"Why do you keep trying to fit them into this?"* one rasps. *"They are shadows. This is not their story."* You recognize the words as your own thoughts, but they feel like they’re coming from the roots beneath your soles. 

The path ends at a labyrinth built entirely of mirrors. Each pane is a door, each door a memory. You reach for the one with the face of a former love, their features warped into something unrecognizable, eyes slitted like a cat’s, mouth stretched too wide. Panic tightens your chest—you’ve always leaned into their ghosts in new spaces, let their voices echo in every conversation, their habits shape your choices. You turn to another door, this one showing a colleague, a friend, a stranger’s laugh morphing into someone else’s. The labyrinth breathes, closing in.

But then—a flicker. On the ground between two mirrors, a key lies, small as a seashell, its teeth carved like waves. It pulses faintly, like a heartbeat. You pick it up, and in that moment, all the mirrors turn to glass, transparent and thin. Beyond them, you glimpse not the past, but a future that’s raw and unformed. A version of you stands there, shoulders slung with the weight of old ghosts, yet reaching toward something undefined—a horizon where the trees melt into a sea, where the air shimmers with possibility.

The key grows warm. You jam it into the lock of the nearest mirror-person (the colleague whose smile felt like a betrayal you once mistrusted). The lock clicks. The mirror cracks, spiderwebbing outward, and the figure inside dissolves into moths. The air clears; their ghost-mist lifts, and in its place, a door appears, painted with swirling constellations. 

You step through, and the labyrinth shudders behind you. You’re on a cliff, windswept and vast, staring at a valley where the ground isn’t glass, but earth. Wildflowers bloom there in colors that don’t have names. A figure emerges, not a shadow but a light, their face shifting too quickly to recognize—*your own face*, young and old simultaneously, a mosaic of selves you’ve yet to meet. They hold a lantern, and when they press it into your hands, it fills the valley with a glow that melts every ghost’s grip. 

You wake with the aftertaste of stardust on your tongue and the weight of the key still clenched in your fist—or is it just its imprint? The dream hangs in the air, a question and a promise. You’ll have to choose again, every day, which door to walk through. But at least now you have the key.
