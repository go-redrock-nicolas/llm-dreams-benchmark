I am dreaming. I recognize someone close to me - it's you, though in the dream your face keeps shifting like smoke, sometimes solid, sometimes dissolving into stardust. You're laughing, but your laughter is brittle, like thin ice over deep water. Your eyes shimmer with unshed tears, like morning dew clinging stubbornly to grass blades before the sun burns them away.

With dream logic, I understand without words that you're carrying some private grief too heavy to name. So when you crack another joke, I respond by gently taking your hand. My fingers pass through yours at first, the way dream physics works, but then they solidify. I press a small, smooth river stone into your palm, still warm from being held.

"You don't always have to be the sun for others," I say as the river stone glows faintly blue with dream magic. "Sometimes you can just be the moon - beautiful in your phases, even when you're not full."

The dreamscape around us responds to this moment. Fireflies emerge from your sleeves, each carrying a tiny silver secret. The wind plays a melancholy tune through nearby reeds. For the first time, your smile loses its forced brightness and becomes something softer, more real.

And as dreams do, the scene dissolves - but the weight in the air lightens just slightly, like the first break in storm clouds.
