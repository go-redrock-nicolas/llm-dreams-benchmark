I am dreaming. am suddenly lifted from the shadows into the glaring, ethereal spotlight. The air trembles with anticipation—a crowd assembled on the ragged edge of reality. Before me stands a colossal, silver spiral staircase, coiling up into the clouds and vanishing into a sky that simmers in impossible shades of ultraviolet and emerald.

Beneath the staircase, a chasm yawns wide, bottomless and pulsing with spectral light. The stunt? I must ascend this ever-shifting staircase, dancing on steps that flicker in and out of existence, to grasp an orb of living lightning suspended at its pinnacle—no harness, no nets, just trust in my own heart and the wilting laws of physics.

Scoffs and whispers ripple through the onlookers—masked figures with glowing, uncertain eyes. The air snaps with electric hope and sharp fear.

I draw a breath, tasting something wild and metallic, then leap to the first step. Instantly, it quivers and tries to vanish beneath me, but my feet become as light as feathers, unbound from gravity’s pull. Each step ahead is a test: sometimes solid as marble, sometimes mere mist, sometimes a scattering of shimmering symbols—musical notes, fractured runes, childhood memories.

As I rise, the jealous wind claws at my limbs, trying to drag me into the abyss. The orb above grows wilder, lightning snaking from it in tendrils of gold and blue, each one brushing the steps below and causing them to chime like distant cathedral bells.

The doubts of the crowd become a physical force—some heavy, pressing me down, others curling around me like fog. I push forward by wrapping myself in thoughts of boundless courage and hope, memories blossoming in my mind like phosphorescent flowers: sunlight on water, laughter echoing on a mountainside, the peace of being small and endless at once.

At the top, the orb pulses with longing, daring me to seize it. I leap, hands outstretched—time thins to a silken thread as I grasp the heart of lightning. Energy courses through me, not painful but exhilarating—awakening every sense and memory, filling me with the music of the universe.

I look down. The staircase solidifies beneath me, and the doubts of the crowd combust, transforming into a sudden roar of joy and belief. The masked faces beam with wonder. I have done what no expert could—I have willed possibility into being, one trembling step at a time.

I stand atop the world with the orb cradled in my hands, illuminating the darkness below, and wake to the echo of applause—carrying a piece of that impossible dream back into the dawn.
