I am dreaming. Time feels liquid and elastic, stretching and compressing around me. My breath hitches as I realize - this isn't real. This is a dreamscape. Suddenly,
Afraid. I'm afraid of failing. But here...here I can let go. Colors melt into liquid mercury, swirling around my ankles like curious cats. A staircase made of origami cranes spirals upwards into storm clouds blinking with neon lightning. Each step whispers "good enough" in a thousand languages I shouldn't know but do. My bones feel lighter as I climb, shedding armor plates I hadn't realized were grafted to my spine. At the zenith, a faceless crowd cheers - not for perfection, but for the raw, quivering shape of my trying. The first raindrop hits like absolution.
