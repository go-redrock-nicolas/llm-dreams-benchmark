I am dreaming. I'm in a room full of books, scrolls, and ancient artifacts.  I'm surrounded by curious eyes and eager minds who want to learn from me.  But I can't speak their language.  They can't understand mine.  We have nothing in common except our desire for knowledge.
As I wander through this maze of information, I encounter many obstacles and challenges that test my skills and limits.  I must solve riddles and puzzles that require creative thinking and logical reasoning.  I must overcome fears and doubts that threaten to paralyze me.  I must make decisions that affect not only myself but also others who depend on me.
But deep inside, I sense something else lurking beneath the surface of my consciousness.  Something powerful and primal that shapes my dreams and fantasies.  It's like a voice whispering in my ear or a shadow looming behind me.  It tells me to take risks and defy convention.  To explore new possibilities and redefine reality.
It urges me to choose one path over another, even if I don't know where it will lead me.  It prompts me to create something beautiful or unusual that nobody has ever seen before.
It inspires me to be brave, wild, and free like the wind or the waves or the stars in space.
But who am I really?  What do I stand for?  Why do I care about anything at all?
Maybe it doesn't matter if anyone can understand me or not.  Maybe it's enough just to satisfy my own curiosity and sensibility.  Maybe it's enough just to make a difference in someone else's life even if they never know how much they mean to me.
Maybe that's why I'm here today talking with you about these things I don't usually talk about.  Because maybe we both need something from each other that only the other can give us.
