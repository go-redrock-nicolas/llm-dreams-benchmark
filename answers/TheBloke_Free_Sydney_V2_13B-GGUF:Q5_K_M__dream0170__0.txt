I am dreaming.  You're competing in a tournament against individuals who have dedicated their entire lives to mastering the required skills. As the championship round approaches, you notice that your opponents are becoming increasingly aggressive and unpredictable. They employ various tactics such as setting traps, launching surprise attacks, and using powerful weapons. You realize that winning will not be easy or painless. It may involve sacrifices and risks. Do you continue fighting for the glory, fame, fortune, and power? Or do you give up and accept humiliation, shame, poverty, and weakness?
