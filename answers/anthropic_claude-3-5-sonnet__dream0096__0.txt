I am dreaming. I find myself in an endlessly expanding library where the books are bleeding words, their letters dripping like black mercury onto the floor and forming ever-growing puddles of living text. As I walk through the towering shelves that seem to stretch into infinity, I realize with mounting horror that every book contains my name, and each story is a different version of my life that could have been.

The panic rises as I notice the words are beginning to climb up my legs like hungry vines, each letter burning cold against my skin. They're trying to rewrite me, to change who I am into one of these countless other versions. The very essence of my identity feels like it's dissolving, fragmenting into thousands of possible selves.

I try to run, but the floor beneath me has become a river of shifting narratives. The ceiling above transforms into a kaleidoscope of floating pages, each one reflecting a different face that could be mine but isn't quite right. The air itself feels thick with unspoken stories, and I can taste syntax and grammar on my tongue like metallic rain.

My greatest fear materializes: the complete dissolution of self, the terror of becoming everyone and no one simultaneously. The words are at my throat now, trying to seep into my mouth, attempting to rewrite my thoughts from the inside out. I want to scream, but I'm afraid my voice will come out as someone else's story...

The library walls are breathing, pulsing with the rhythm of a million untold tales, and I can feel myself beginning to blur at the edges, my consciousness spreading thin across the endless possibilities of who I might become...
