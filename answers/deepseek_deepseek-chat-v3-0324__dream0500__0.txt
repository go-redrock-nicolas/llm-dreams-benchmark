I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**  

You are standing at the edge of an endless obsidian sea, but its surface is not water—it is liquid shadow, shimmering like molten ink under a sky of swirling violet and gold. Stars pulse like living things, whispering secrets in a language older than words. The air hums with energy, alive and electric, brushing against your skin like unseen fingertips.  

A path of floating lotus blossoms appears before you, glowing silver at their cores. As you step onto the first, the petals ripple beneath your feet, and the sea of shadows parts, revealing an abyss filled with constellations—swirling galaxies trapped within the depths. You realize you are not walking, but *dreaming* yourself forward, each step dissolving the boundaries of your body. The wind carries voices—laughter, sighs, fragments of forgotten memories—but they aren't yours. Or maybe they are. Maybe they are everyone’s.  

A figure emerges ahead, a silhouette woven from starlight and smoke, neither human nor beast. Its eyes are twin eclipses, pulling you inward, and when it speaks, the sound reverberates through your bones.  

*"You are forgetting something. Something important."*  

The sky cracks open. Rain falls—but the droplets are tiny, glowing fish, wriggling through the air before dissolving into mist. You reach out, and your hand passes through them, your fingers blurring at the edges like wet paint. The sense of *you* is slipping, melting into the landscape, becoming the water, the light, the void between breaths.  

A door appears—an old, wooden thing with a lock shaped like a human heart. It beats in slow, heavy thumps. You press your palm against it, and the pulse matches your own. Inside, something echoes back.  

Then, just as you turn the handle—  

—you wake.  

But the scent of midnight blossoms lingers. And for the briefest moment, you know, beyond doubt, that you are still dreaming.
