I am dreaming. I'm walking through the corridors of my childhood home, except the hallways stretch impossibly long, wallpaper breathing like lungs beneath peeling edges. My footsteps echo on floorboards that whisper back forgotten conversations. A mounting sense of dread builds in my chest—I've forgotten something crucial, something that cannot be undone.

The walls close in as I realize my mistake: I've lost something irreplaceable. A memory? A person? My future? The anxiety crystallizes into physical weight pressing down on my shoulders.

I reach a door I recognize but shouldn't be here. When I open it, I find not a room but a vast, twilight meadow where fireflies spell out warnings I can almost read. The grass ripples like ocean waves beneath a moon three times too large, casting shadows that move independently of their sources.

Desperate, I call out to silhouettes of people scattered across the field. My parents, friends, colleagues—they turn toward me with faces blank as untouched canvas. When I explain my crisis, tears flowing freely now, they simply tilt their heads in perfect unison. One by one, they open their mouths, but instead of words, butterflies emerge—iridescent blues and purples—carrying fragments of advice that dissolve into mist before I can grasp them.

I fall to my knees, the impossible burden overwhelming me, when a child I don't recognize approaches. She carries a lantern made from what looks like my own heartbeat. "They can't help," she says, her voice echoing from everywhere and nowhere, "because they aren't real. But neither is your problem."

The meadow begins folding inward like origami, stars bending into geometric patterns. I feel myself becoming lighter, understanding dawning that this crisis, this fear, is a construct of my sleeping mind. The child places the lantern in my hands, and within its light, I see reflections of my waking self solving impossible problems, surviving unbearable losses, creating beauty from chaos.

"Remember this feeling," the child whispers as the dream begins to dissolve, "the moment when you realize you were never truly alone."
