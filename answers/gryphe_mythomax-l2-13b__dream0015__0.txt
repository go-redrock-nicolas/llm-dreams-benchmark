I am dreaming. I find myself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers lurking around every corner. The sun is setting, casting an eerie glow over the barren landscape. I can feel the chill in the air, reminding me that winter is approaching fast. The charred remains of what used to be cities are scattered around, and the only sound I hear is the howling of the wind.

As I walk through this desolate world, I stumble upon a small group of survivors huddled around a makeshift campfire. They look up at me with weary faces, their clothes torn and dirty. They seem to have nothing left but the hope that tomorrow will bring something better.

Suddenly, a loud growl echoes through the canyon. It's the unmistakable sound of a ferocious beast, something I've only read about in old storybooks. The group around the fire exchanges anxious glances, realizing they are in grave danger.

Together, they stand their ground, drawing their meager weapons. As the beast emerges from the shadows, I catch my breath in horror. It's a Scylla, a nine-headed monster from Greek mythology, looking just as terrifying as I imagined. Its scaly skin gleams in the flickering light of the fire, and its many mouths snap and hiss threateningly.

Determined to fight, the group charges at the beast. A fierce battle ensues, with the survivors trying desperately to bring down the giant creature. Arrows fly, swords clash, and fire crackles. The Scylla roars in pain, but shows no signs of giving up.

Just when I think all hope is lost, a strange light appears in the sky. It grows brighter and brighter, washing over the area in a blinding flash. When my vision clears, I see that the Scylla has vanished, and the survivors are standing there, dazed but alive.

In the center of the group, a figure steps forward, dressed in shimmering robes. They raise their hand, and a beam of light shoots down from the sky, encircling the group in a protective shield. The light fades, revealing that the survivors are gone, and in their place stands a magnificent city, shining bright against the darkened sky.

I am awoken by the sound of my alarm clock, shaking my head trying to clear my dream.
