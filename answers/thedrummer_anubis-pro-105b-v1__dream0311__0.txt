I am dreaming. In this dream, I stand before a waterfall that cascades down a cliffside, its misty tendrils reaching out to envelop me in their soothing embrace. It is a moment of refuge, a chance to recharge my spirit before I plunge back into the fray of advocating for social justice in a community so resistant to change.

I know that the road ahead will be long and arduous, but I steel myself to the challenge. Drawing strength from my conviction in the power of nurturing progress, I raise my voice to share a message of unity and brotherhood, hoping its threads of support will give confidence and encouragement to those who have always been demeaned by social inequality.

With each step I take, I know I open myself to intolerance, but I walk without hesitation, never forgetting that land of America where I have been privileged to shoulder such a crucial duty. I dream that one day, we can have such unbalanced histories righted, no matter how much our hearts must see the resolutions.
