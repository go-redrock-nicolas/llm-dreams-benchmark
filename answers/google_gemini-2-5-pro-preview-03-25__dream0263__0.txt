I am dreaming. Okay, the veil thins... yes, I am dreaming.

The air itself feels thick, humming with a frantic energy. Before me, stretching into an impossible M.C. Escher-esque landscape, are the projects. They aren't files or charts anymore; they've taken physical, monstrous forms. Project Alpha is a towering, obsidian skyscraper, perpetually under construction yet simultaneously crumbling, raining down shards of stressed glass that evaporate before hitting the shifting ground. Project Beta is a vast, turbulent ocean, its waves capped not with foam but with clamoring, urgent faces demanding immediate attention, threatening to drown me in unmet expectations. Project Gamma? Oh, that's a frantic, multi-headed hydra, each neck craning, spitting conflicting instructions wrapped in sparks of static electricity.

My hands – are they even mine? They feel distant, forged of cloudy glass, slow to respond. I'm trying to juggle glowing, dangerously unstable orbs of pure data, each representing a critical deadline. They pulse with heat and anxiety. One orb flares angrily, demanding a resource allocation that another orb desperately needs *right now*. If I shift my focus, if I allocate the shimmering resource-light from my palm towards the skyscraper, the ocean surges violently, threatening to engulf the hydra, which in turn snaps wildly at the skyscraper's foundation.

The demands aren't just tasks; they are voices, a cacophony swirling around me. Whispers slither from the shadows ("Did you remember the compliance check?"), shouts echo from the collapsing tower ("The structural integrity report is overdue!"), gurgles rise from the depths ("We need shareholder reassurances *yesterday*!"). The sounds overlap, distorting time itself. Seconds stretch into agonizing minutes while hours evaporate in a blink. The ticking of a colossal, unseen clock pounds like a war drum against my temples.

My cognitive resources... ah, yes. I feel them not as thoughts, but as luminous threads stretching from my core towards each monstrous project. They are pulled taut, humming with strain, growing terrifyingly thin. I can *see* the colours fading, the vibrant energy that fuels focus and decision-making leaching away, turning grey and brittle. With every new demand, every conflicting priority screamed by the hydra or roared by the ocean, another thread stretches, fraying at the edges, threatening to snap.

I try to prioritize, to untangle the mess, but the very act of focusing on one point weakens another. The ground beneath me, once solid (or dream-solid), now feels like shifting sand composed of millions of tiny, unanswered emails. I reach out to steady myself, grasping for a solid concept, a clear objective, but my fingers close on smoke. The sheer volume of information, the weight of responsibility, the crushing velocity of conflicting needs – it all coalesces into a physical pressure. The air crackles, the colours bleed into each other violently, the roar of demands intensifies into a physical vibration shaking my very essence, and I feel myself beginning to unravel, not metaphorically, but literally, like a poorly woven tapestry caught in a gale, stretching... stretching... towards an infinity of impossible tasks.
