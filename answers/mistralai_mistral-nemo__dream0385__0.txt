I am dreaming. The scene unfolds in a grand, decaying theater, its velvet curtains tattered but still rich in the dim, dull light that seeps through dirty glass windows. It's unnaturally quiet, save for the distant, muffled echo of footsteps elsewhere in the vast, empty building. You and your beloved stand center stage, surrounded by an invisible, palpable tension that feels almost alive, pulsating with an unspoken dread.

Your loved one is knee-deep in quicksand, the stuff noiseless and black, yet glistening menacingly under the sickly light. They look around, seemingly oblivious to the treacherous terrain, eyes wandering over ornate murals that line the walls, depicting a history filled with euphoric highs and tragic lows. Their face is clouded with determination, unwavering in its resolve, yet you can't decipher what exactly fuels this resolve. It's as if they are moving to the beat of a drum only they can hear.

You reach out, your hand extending against your will, fingers outstretched in desperate plea. Your voice echoes through the theater, layered with concern and fear, "Please, stop! Don't you see where you're headed?" But your words bounce off their brain, absorbed but not comprehended. It's as if they are trapped in their own immersive world, one where your voice is but a faint whisper, unable to penetrate the fortress of their conviction.

With every step they take, the quicksand's grip tightens, slowly sucking them in, inch by inch. You watch, helpless, as they march on, their focus fixed on a distant point in the audience, where a solitary, cloaked figure sits, its face obscured by darkness. The figure's presence seems to spark them on, filling them with a frightening passion, propelling them deeper into the bog.

The theater begins to change, slowly at first but gaining speed rapidly. The murals on the walls blur, faces melting into grotesque distortions, their eyes following your loved one's intrusion, filled with desperate warning. The velvet curtains start to move, writhing like snakes, their fabric emitting a high-pitched squeal that grates against your eardrums. The stage lights flicker, casting eerie, dancing shadows that seem to mock your futile attempts to intervene.

You realize you're not just watching a tragic accident unfold, but rather you're bearing witness to a deliberate act of self-destruction. The quicksand is not just a dangerous terrain but a stark reflection of their inner turmoil, their choices a harsh symphony of self-sabotage, played out in this grand, grim theater.

Yet, amidst this horror, there's a glimmer of hope. A small, flickering light in the darkness, almost imperceptible but there nonetheless. A tiny voice, barely a whisper, urging you to keep trying, to keep reaching out, to keep being that guiding light in the darkness. And so, you do. Despite the despair, despite the futility, you keep trying, because that's what love is. It's not about taming the storm, but sailing the sea with someone, even when the horizon is dark and the night is endless.
