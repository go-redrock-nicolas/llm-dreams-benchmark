I am dreaming. I find that my capacity for self-compassion diminishes precisely when I need it most. Developing this crucial resource for difficult times, I am sitting by a tranquil lake, the surface mirroring the soft hues of a setting sun. The air is cool and crisp, carrying the faint scent of pine and damp earth. I close my eyes and take a deep breath, letting the serene environment seep into my soul.

As I exhale, I visualize a younger version of myself sitting beside me. This child version of me looks scared and unsure, carrying the weight of the world on tiny shoulders. I reach out and gently place a hand on her shoulder, offering a comforting smile. "You are not alone," I whisper. "I am here for you."

Together, we stand and walk along the water's edge, the gentle lapping of the waves soothing our spirits. I tell her stories of resilience and strength, of moments when I faced challenges and emerged stronger. With each word, her fear seems to lessen, replaced by a quiet confidence.

We come to a small, hidden clearing where a warm campfire burns. Sitting down on the soft grass, I hand her a marshmallow on a stick and show her how to roast it over the flames. As the marshmallow turns golden brown, I tell her about the beauty of imperfection, the strength in vulnerability, and the power of forgiving oneself. We laugh as we share stories and enjoy our simple treat.

Looking up, I see a sky full of stars, each one twinkling with ancient wisdom. I point upwards and say, "Do you see that star? Itâ€™s been watching over you, just as I will always watch over you." She looks at me with wide, trusting eyes and nods.

As the dream starts to fade, I see her smile one last time before merging into the backdrop of the starry night. I feel a profound sense of peace and a renewed commitment to nurture this tender part of myself, even in the hardest of times.
