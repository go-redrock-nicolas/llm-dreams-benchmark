I am dreaming. # THE UNRAVELING GAMBIT

I stand atop the glass observation deck of the Meridian Tower, the city sprawled beneath me like a circuit board pulsing with light and purpose. My team—six specialists chosen for their unparalleled abilities—are positioned throughout the building below. The weight of the earpiece feels heavier tonight, each breath from my operatives more pronounced.

"Proximity check," I murmur, and five confirmations come in sequence—crisp, professional.

Only Elara hesitates. "In position... I think."

That subtle waver in her voice sends a cold ripple across my consciousness. The Chernov manuscripts we're extracting are protected by systems designed to detect even a microsecond of uncertainty.

The operation begins seamlessly. Dante disables the primary security grid with his usual flourish. Mei navigates the thermal sensors like she's dancing between raindrops. But then—the first slip. Kwan transmits the bypass code with a digit transposed.

"That's 9-3-7, not 9-7-3," I correct, a strange thickness in my throat.

The air feels suddenly wrong—too dense, too warm. The city lights below begin to pulse in an unsettling rhythm, synchronized with my heartbeat.

Marcus drops a calibration tool. The sound echoes impossibly loud. Elara turns left instead of right at a critical junction. Each mistake small, but accumulating like toxic particles in the bloodstream.

"Focus," I command, but my voice stretches and distorts. The building seems to breathe beneath me now, the glass floor becoming translucent, then liquid. My team's faces begin to shift subtly—their features remaining recognizable but somehow wrong, like photographs left too long in the sun.

I realize with mounting horror that I can no longer remember why the manuscripts are important, only that failing is unthinkable. The city below starts rearranging itself, buildings sliding like puzzle pieces. The sky darkens not to night but to something deeper—a cosmic void studded with stars that blink in patterns that almost form words.

My team's errors multiply, reality fraying at every mistake. The manuscripts we seek are suddenly visible to me—floating pages covered not in text but in intricate diagrams of my own neural pathways.

I understand now. This isn't just an operation failing.
This is consciousness itself coming undone.
