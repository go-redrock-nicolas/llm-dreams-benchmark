I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as though the universe itself is breathing. You stand at the edge of a vast, shifting landscape where the ground ripples like liquid mercury beneath your feet, reflecting a sky smeared with auroras of impossible colors—violet flames, gold shadows, emerald static. Each step you take sends concentric waves outward, distorting the horizon into fractals. You feel weightless, yet your bones ache with the gravity of unspoken burdens.  

Suddenly, your skin begins to *change*. It glows faintly, translucent, revealing a network of veins that pulse not with blood, but with liquid starlight. Memories flicker there: a childhood room dissolving into ash, a lover’s face fracturing like glass, deadlines looming like jagged mountains. You realize your body is a map of your mind—every emotion etched into flesh. Anxiety tightens your ribs into a cage of thorns; grief pools in your stomach like molten lead. The dream whispers: *You carry what you refuse to feel*.  

A door materializes—a colossal oak door suspended in midair, its surface writhing with carvings of your deepest fears. You grasp the handle, which morphs into a serpent coiling around your wrist, and step through.  

Inside: a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflecting a fractured version of yourself. One shows you as a child, knees scraped, clutching a toy that crumbles to dust. Another reveals a future self, hollow-eyed and crumbling like parchment. But in the center of the maze stands a figure—a doppelgänger with your face, but eyes like twin supernovae. It speaks without moving its lips: *“You think healing is a straight line. It’s a spiral. A storm. A shedding.”*  

The ground cracks open. You fall.  

Into a forest where the trees are made of bone, their branches clawing at a moon that weeps black rain. Here, your breath crystallizes into gemstones that shatter on the ground, each containing a suppressed scream. You run, but roots snag your ankles, whispering *“Stay. Face us.”* When you finally stop fleeing, the earth softens. The roots bloom into roses whose petals are your own journal pages, ink smudged with tears you never shed.  

A river appears, its current a swirl of forgotten moments. You wade in. The water is warm, viscous—amniotic. It peels away layers of armor you didn’t know you wore: the sarcasm, the numbness, the relentless chase for control. Submerged, you drown… and are reborn. Your lungs fill not with water, but light. When you emerge, your body is new—skin like river-smoothed stone, hair like cascading wildfire, heart beating in time with the auroras above.  

The dream shifts again. You’re in a meadow where every flower is a synapse firing, electric and alive. A stag with antlers of tangled wire approaches, its eyes two flickering holograms. It bows, and you climb onto its back. Together, you gallop through a canyon carved from a thousand half-written letters, each crevice echoing with unsaid words. The wind tears at your clothes, then stitches them anew from threads of forgiveness.  

At dawn, the stag stops. The horizon bleeds into a canvas of gold. You dismount and press your palms to the earth. A surge of understanding floods you: stress was never the enemy. It was the body’s hieroglyphs, begging to be read. You vow to listen—to cradle pain like a compass, not a curse.  

The dream unravels. You wake in your bed, sheets tangled, heart racing. But your hands are steady. Your breath is slow. For the first time in years, your muscles don’t feel like coiled wire. The labyrinth has been walked. The map, redrawn.  

And somewhere, deep in the marrow, healing begins.
