I am dreaming. Or perhaps I am being drawn into a vision so vivid it mocks the boundaries between reality and the unreal.  

The sky—what blue shards remain—are split by ribbons of neon-green lightning that twist like living veins in the cosmic flesh above. A planet not unlike Earth looms low on the horizon, but its reflections pulse, distorted somehow—as if both present and imaginary, a relic of thought in celestial form. Below me, the ground is neither land nor water. It breathes like flesh, shimmers like crystal, and pulses with a heartbeat rhythm—if the world itself had been dreamed into a sentient slumber.

I have been chosen. Not by lottery, not by committee. The dream-makers chose me. I dreamed too much, too boldly. I wandered too far in the quiet hours when mind moves beyond the body's cage. And in doing so, I attracted their interest.

The entity that summoned me looked like nothing. And yet that nothing had color—in impossible ways, hues that stroke your senses in four dimensions. I call it nothing only because no word can describe what "It" was. It had origin. It had title. And finally, it had mission. Something involving a fraying string between the "Here" and the "Beyond." I don’t fully understand. Maybe I’m not meant to.

But this much I know: a rift has opened in the very fabric of imagination. Not around us, not in space or time—but deeper, in the realm of possibility itself. Concepts that once lived only in myth are now bleeding into the waking world. Dragons whisper in boardrooms. Shadows of long-dead gods invade actors’ dreams. Entire cities vanish into legends that afterward never existed. If this unraveling continues, imagination itself will die, and so too the freedom to dream.

So they’ve chosen me. The only one still capable of raw dreaming. Perhaps because I've resisted becoming jaded. Or because, when I sleep, I forget the ridges of normality and slip into insanity’s softer, deeper cradles. I don’t know. But they spoke in a language made of music and starlight, and I understood. I have the keys—not of knowledge, but of wonder. That is what makes me valuable, they said. That, and my ability to *feel* stories more than to read them.

Now I prepare for the impossible challenge ahead, standing on a platform that floats atop a translucent ocean of memory. Each ripple that grazes my feet flashes an image: a moment from someone’s childhood, a regret too deep to confess, a joy that outlived time. I imagine my gear, and the dream responds, assembling it from fragments of déjà vu—a coat stitched from forgotten lullabies, pinpricked with buttons that hold every secret I’ve ever whispered to the dark. My rucksack is filled with time instead of objects: pauses borrowed from moments that seemed to stretch forever—the first time I saw the ocean, the hush after a lover’s goodbye.

In my hands: a compass that doesn’t point north, but forward—not forward in direction, but in intent. I follow the needle’s trembling light, and it wavers toward the horizon where the unstable planet glows with feverish intensity.

I step into the unknown, aware that every step I take is being woven through the dream too large to hold in the mind. This mission will not be recorded in history. Perhaps not even remembered. But I know this: if the rift is sealed, imagination will live on. If I fail, the world becomes a duller place, day by day.

But I won’t fail.

Because this isn’t just a dream.

It is the dream. The circle from which all other dreams are born. And I am its lone guardian stepping into the night to find the dawn.
