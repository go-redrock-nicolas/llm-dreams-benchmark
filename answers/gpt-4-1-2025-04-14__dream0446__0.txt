I am dreaming.

I stand at the center of an impossibly vast hall, its marble floors shimmering beneath a shifting sky that glows with colors seen only in the threshold moments between sleeping and waking. Before me, a table stretches endlessly, its surface crowded with thousands of identical, delicate glass keys. Each one is tinted with a different hue—emerald green, sapphire blue, molten gold—but none give hint to the lock they fit.

I am paralyzed by indecision. My hand hovers, trembling between a viridian key and one the color of midnight's deepest blue, but the moment my fingers brush the air above either, a wind stirs from unseen corridors, whispering wordless warnings. How can such an insignificant decision rattle the foundations of my soul? Surely, I think, a choice as simple as this should not carry such weight. Yet the more I contemplate, the heavier the sensation grows—like lead pooling in the hollow of my stomach.

Examining this disproportionate hesitation, I feel the dream unraveling secrets from my subconscious. Each key becomes a memory: the viridian one pulses with the laughter of lost friends; the sapphire one hums with the regret of paths never taken. I realize the keys are not choices at all—they are moments, lived and unlived, possibilities that swirl as phantoms beneath my indecisive skin. Every refusal to choose echoes the many times I’ve turned away from crossroads out of fear, and every potential selection radiates with the sharp ache of what could become if only I dared.

Suddenly, the keys lift in silent unison, spinning above me like a halogen constellation. Their shimmering edges fuse into a door made of liquid light, inviting and terrible. I understand now: I cannot leave the hall until I step through, until I accept that the paralysis itself is the true prison, and the act of choosing—even blindly, even imperfectly—is the only way to awaken. So, in the center of my dream, I inhale, fill my lungs with the cool, opaline air, and walk boldly toward the door, the weight of hesitation finally dissolving as dawn breaks on the other side.
