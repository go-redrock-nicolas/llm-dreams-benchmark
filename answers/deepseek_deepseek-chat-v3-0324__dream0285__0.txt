I am dreaming. The room around me is hazy, bathed in the underwater glow of dim, flickering lights. The voices of the others rise and fall like waves, crashing against the walls, their words blurring into a murmuring tide. They are nodding, agreeing with the idea I find so unsettling—something about tearing down the old library in town to build something sleek and cold, something without history. My stomach twists. The smell of old books, ink, and dust whispers in my memory, though I can’t tell if it's real or imagined.  

My lips part, but no sound comes out. The weight of their collective certainty presses down on my chest, like stone slabs stacked upon me. One of them—a sharp-faced woman with eyes like polished glass—laughs at something I don’t hear, and the sound is the shattering of a wine glass, sudden and startling.  

Then I see it.  

Between the slats of the conference table, roots twist up through the floorboards. Tiny at first, then thicker, splitting the wood, curling around chair legs. The others don’t notice. Ivy unfurls from the ceiling, brushing my shoulder, and I realize I’m gripping the edge of the table—except the wood is softer now, like parchment. My fingers sink into it slightly.  

A single breath. I speak.  

"You’re wrong."  

The room quivers like disturbed water. The roots surge upward in response, cracking through walls, curling around the sharp-faced woman’s wrist. She doesn’t react. The others keep talking, but their voices are muffled now, distant. Only the library remains, its ghost superimposed over the room—shelves bursting through plaster, pages fluttering like moth wings. A book lands in my lap, its spine warm, pulsing faintly.  

When I open it, the words inside glow gold, and the dream tilts, and I know—I'm not just speaking. I'm rewriting something. The roots tighten around my ankles, not to hold me down.  

To anchor me.  

The last thing I hear before waking is my own voice, steady and strong, ringing through the crumbling room: *"Listen."*  

And for the first time, they do.  

Then—  

Silence. Breath. The faint scent of old paper lingering in the air.
