I am dreaming. …open your eyes to a sky that is somehow both midnight-black and sunrise-gold at once, every star a glowing ember drifting lazily toward the horizon like fireflies set free from gravity. You stand barefoot on a road of crystalline glass that hums with each heartbeat, splintering into three distinct paths. Behind you, echoes of all those earlier battles crackle in the air—frayed memories flicker like film reels: the job that collapsed without warning, the friendship that shattered in a single text message, the quiet phone call carrying news no one wishes to hear. The weight of them presses at your back, yet the dream refuses to let you crumble.  

Crossroads #1:  
To the left, a corridor of towering library shelves curves away into mist. Every volume is bound in mirrored silver that reflects not your face, but the faces of people who once believed in you. Their expressions morph—startled, proud, grieving, radiant—depending on how you tilt your head. A breeze flips pages, and you catch words you’ve never written but somehow recognize: “Pain sharpens purpose the way a whetstone kisses steel.” The air smells of rain on parchment.

Crossroads #2:  
Straight ahead, a staircase made of giant lotus petals unfurls into the sky. Each petal is large enough to serve as its own landing; veins pulse with moon-lit sap. At the top—a doorway cut from living obsidian—rotates slowly, as though deciding whether to offer passage. The staircase hums the lullaby your mother sang the night before your first day of school. Climbing would mean facing the intangible—the “why” behind all those storms—yet the music makes your knees tremble with a familiar, child-like awe.

Crossroads #3:  
To the right, a ravine opens in the earth, but its depths glow with bioluminescent rivers rather than darkness. Here, ghostly silhouettes of former versions of yourself—ages six, sixteen, twenty-three—stand upon drifting lily pads of light, waving as if to say, We’re still here, stitched into your marrow. A rope bridge woven from fireflies stretches across, flickering with each breath of wind. Crossing would require trust that those tiny sparks won’t burn out beneath your weight.

You take a step backward, indecision pounding in your chest—until a shadow detaches from the midnight-gold sky. It coalesces into a figure shaped like you but crowned with antlers of glass. Its voice rings like wind through chimes:

“Choose not the easiest route, but the honest one.”

You remember honesty: the time you admitted fear and discovered it was softer than pretending to be unbreakable. So you draw a breath scented with ozone and old ink and gingerly place a foot on the firefly bridge—Crossroads #3.

The fireflies burst into brighter brilliance, weaving themselves into constellations beneath your soles. With each step, the ravine sings—a choir of every tear you shed, harmonizing into something achingly gorgeous. The child-selves reach toward you, merging like watercolor into your skin until you feel whole, past and present interlaced.

On the far side, ground solidifies into a garden whose flowers bloom in impossible patterns: spirals inside fractals inside galaxies. You realize each blossom is a memory rewritten in color: the apology you never received now glows violet and gold; the night you nearly gave up sprouts scarlet petals that refuse to wilt; the moment you forgave yourself unfurls as a massive, luminous lotus radiating warmth.

At the center of this garden rises a tree made entirely of hourglasses. Sand tumbles upward instead of down. You place a palm on the glassy bark, and your hardships crystallize inside the hourglasses one by one—job loss, heartbreak, illness—spinning until they transform into motes of glittering sand. The tree exhales, scattering those grains into the wind so they become the sky’s newest stars.

You are no longer trapped at a crossroads; the paths have folded into the earth, absorbed by the garden’s quiet miracle. Above, the double-colored sky fuses into a dawn unlike any you’ve seen: lavender with streaks of molten copper. Birds carved from origami words swoop past, and each beat of their paper wings writes a new sentence across the horizon: “STILL YOU RISE.”

Your chest feels lighter than it has in months—maybe years—as you realize every hardship was a seed, buried deep so it could break open and root. You turn toward the horizon, where an ocean made of liquid light beckons. The shadow-self with glass antlers bows, satisfied.

And before the waking world whispers you back, you hear the garden dream itself speak—a voice made of rustling leaves and turning pages:

“This, resilient soul, is not the end of adversity. But it is the end of believing adversity defines you. Walk on, author of your own constellations.”

You step forward, and the dream dissolves into dawn’s first sigh—carrying the scent of rain on newborn petals, carrying the certainty that every crossroads from here on will bloom beneath your feet.
