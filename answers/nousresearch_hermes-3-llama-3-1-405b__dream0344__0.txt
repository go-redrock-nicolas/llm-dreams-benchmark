I am dreaming. My dream starts with me soaring over an azure ocean, the sun a ball of fiery gold above the horizon. I am weightless, caught between the sea and the sky, the cool wind in my hair as seagulls cry out in delight around me.

I soon find myself in a market square, a myriad of bright fabrics and bric-a-brac adorn the tables. The air is filled with laughter, joy, and the scents of exotic spices. You can hear the haggling of buyers and sellers, mixed in with the sweet melodies of buskers playing their hearts out. I am at peace as I wander around this place, running my fingers over intricate patterns and designs.

As the day turns into night, I am in the middle of a dense forest. Woven between the branches of ancient trees are fairylights, leading me to a grand marquee nestled below the canopy. I make my way through the crowd, each person gorgeously decorated with flora and jewels. At the centre of the marquee, there is a raised platform. Sat upon this stage is the person I do not fully trust, eyes glinting with secrets untold. I know that they want me to share my deepest thoughts with them, to barter my mind for their potential knowledge. A battle of wills.

Instead of approaching this mysterious figure, I reach out to touch the shoulder of someone else who has drawn my gaze. As they turn to face me, I am momentarily struck by their unconventional beauty, forged from the brilliance of the dream. We exchange no words, but an understanding passes between us. Together, we turn and walk away from the marquee, choosing to ignore the pleading calls of the person I do not trust.

As dawn breaks, this stranger and I find ourselves sprawled atop a cliff, watching the sun return to its post in the sky. The air is fresh and damp with morning dew, the grass tickling our bare feet as we dangle them over the edge. In this moment, I share my thoughts with this enigma, as they do with me. A chance meeting has turned into cherished intimacy, built on a foundation of vulnerability and trust.

As the dream comes to an end, I feel a sense of warmth and safety, a memory of a wondrous world where I chose to protect my heart and mind. With the larks as my witness, I allow this dream to wash away, storing it forever in a pocket of my subconscious.
