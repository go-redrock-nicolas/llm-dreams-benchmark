I am dreaming. As I stand swaying in the pitch-black subway car, the sudden loss of motion jolts through my body. The absence of the train's constant rumble is deafening, replaced by the panicked gasps and murmurs of the other passengers. A chorus of angry horns echoes through the car as those nearby reach for their phones, struggling to find any sign of light in the suffocating darkness.

Their frustrated shouts join discordant with the scraping of shoes against the floor as people instinctively move, some trying to make their way towards the exits while others huddle closer, seeking comfort in proximity. The air thickens with anxiety, and I feel a bead of sweat trickle down my temple in the oppressive heat.

Then, without warning, the faintest sputter of a blue glow appears near the front of the car. It grows, casting eerie shadows as the emergency lights flicker to life, bathing everyone in an otherworldly radiance. The dim light allows me to see the concern etched on passengers' faces, some clutching their belongings more tightly, others reaching out to steady themselves against poles or nearby shoulders. A woman's muffled sob pierces the tense quiet.

The train's intercom crackles, sending waves through the car. "We are experiencing technical difficulties." Comes the garbled, apologetic announcement. "Please remain calm and follow the instructions of the emergency team." But no team appears, leaving us suspended in this underground purgatory, surrounded by only the soft hum of the backup systems and the whispered prayers of my fellow travelers.

As the minutes stretch into what feels like hours, claustrophobia presses down. The small space of the subway car suddenly feels more cavelike than ever, trapping us all beneath tons of earth and steel. The glow of the emergency lights casts strange, dancing shadows on the faces around me, making everyone look like masked actors in some surreal theatre performance.
