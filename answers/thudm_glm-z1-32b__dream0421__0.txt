I am dreaming. In the deepest caves of my consciousness, I find myself floating through a liquid cosmos, my body vaporizing into a thousand prismatic threads that spiral outward like solar wind.  These threads twist around each other, forming intricate constellations of color that pulse to the rhythm of a distant, celestial choral hymn.  As I drift, I see that each thread is a memory, each constellation a possibility yet ungrasped.  A cluster of golden threads morphs into the outline of a dragon made of stardust, its wings beating in slow motion, scattering galaxies at every flap.  I reach out and catch a fragment of its tail, and suddenly, I'm not in the cosmos anymore—I'm standing in a bustling marketplace made entirely of books.  Each stall is a different genre, illuminated by lanterns that drip molten ink, casting shadows that dance like inkblots on damp paper.  A street performer with a harp made of intertwined newspaper headlines is singing a ballad about the fall of Atlantis, and her voice carries the scent of rain on parchment.  A child offers me a flower made of pressed autumn leaves; when I take it, the petals unfurl into a tiny, mechanical clockwork butterfly that hums a tune I know I should recognize but can't quite place.  I pocket the butterfly and follow a path paved with crossword puzzle tiles, each step unlocking a door to a different world—through one, I see a city where buildings are stacked like nested Russian dolls, and through another, a desert where cacti bloom with flowers that look like melting clocks.  As I turn to leave, the marketplace folds itself into a scroll, and the dragon made of stardust emerges again, this time with my face in place of its scales.  It breathes a sigh that turns into a constellation map, and I realize I've been mapping my own soul without even knowing.  I wake up, the memory of the dream still tangled in my fingers like strands of wet seaweed, and reach for my journal to try to capture the rhythm of it all before it slips back into the cosmos.
I am dreaming. Suspended in a cathedral of honeyed twilight, my body dissolves into a flock of moth-winged hourglasses, each casing ticking with the rhythm of long-forgotten tides. These sand-drenched creatures swarm around me, their gossamer wings casting fractal shadows on the walls of this temporal labyrinth—a domed chamber where every breath blows candlelight into constellations. The air tastes of charred parchment and damp reindeer moss, sharp and sweet, while the distant murmur of a Gregorian chant vibrates through my molars, rhythmic as the clinking of wineglasses in a celestial soirée.  

A shadowman with legs made of barbed-wire vines steps from behind an altar of onyx, his face a mosaic of peeling posters advertising lost circuses. He extends a hand carved from licorice roots, and when I take it, his palm tattoos my skin with constellations that burn like frost. The chamber begins to invert, the floor peeling upward into a ceiling of iridescent beetles whose shells shimmer with the colors of a billion sunsets fleeing supernovas. I’m suddenly falling—in repeating loops—through a cloudscape composed of shredded letters, each airborne epistle screaming headlines like *“MOON LODGE OPENS IN THE HORSMASS CONSTELLATION”* or *“GODDESS OF SLOW MUSICEST NOW PERFORMING LIVE IMPROVISATIONS ON THE PIANO OF FORBEAWN KEYS.”*  

A storm of origami falcons divebombs me, their wings screaming with old radio frequencies. One alights on my shoulder, its beak a curl of smoke, and whispers in a language that sounds like rainwater soaking into mud—*“Follow the map written in antlers.”* I materialize a parchment shaped like a deer’s skull, its eye sockets burning blueprints to a city within a Komodo dragon’s ribcage. The pathway weaves through a meadow where poppies bloom with clockwork stamens that wind themselves at dawn, petals unfurling to reveal the skeletal hands of hourglasses, each sapphire hourdrop a trillion years in the making. A child emerges from a thicket of singing bamboo, her hair a fountain of hibiscus flowers that drip nectar as she speaks: *“To remember the future, you must first forget your name.”* She presses a bell into my palm—a bell made of fractured mirrors—and when I ring it, the world fractures.  

Sudden, I’m inside the ribcage-city, breathing through the Komodo’s lungs. The streets are lined with laundromats that wash fabrics from cloudnapkins to comet tails, and customer’s load billows into personalized weather patterns: a widow’s quilt becomes a deluge, a sailor’s rope unravels into a cyclone. In a tavern called *The Overflowing Chalice*, patrons drink from goblets that fill perpetually with ink, their laughter a chorus of typewriter keys clacking midnight sonatas. A bard with a lyre made of melting spoons strums a tune that peels the walls open, revealing a closet-sized black hole spewing stardust that reassembles into a miniature theater presenting *Hamlet* in a dialect of venus flytrap warnings and liquid mercury.  

Outside, the antler-map leads me to a bridge arching over the Eye of the Elephant—a lake whose surface shifts to mirror whatever it cannot contain: first a manmade constellation, then a century-old subway map, then the face I had before I forgot it. Midway, the bridge dissolves into shoals of bioluminescent silt, and I plunge into water that feels like swallowing feathered stars. Below, the lake bed is a mosaic of fractured dream-diaries, each page a glowing tile depicting moments I’ve suppressed or half-remembered—like the time I merged with a streetlamp’s shadow, or the night I heard the ocean sing a lullaby. A school of fish with gills shaped like megaphones sings the chorus of all these secrets, and I realize their scales are mirrors, reflecting not my face, but the person I could have become had I let the ink dry slower.  

I wake disoriented, the taste of liquid constellations still on my tongue, and there in my hand is a single hibiscus petal, its edges already curling into ash. On the ceiling, a crack spiderwebbed in the exact pattern of the antler-map’s final step. I scribble these fragments into my journal, my pen scratching out footnotes to the universe in all caps: *“THE TROPHY CABINET IN THE LOBBY IS ALIVE AND HATES ME. THE FOUNTAIN IS DREAMING IN SLOW-MO. THE BIRDS PEE IN A PARABOLA.”* But the true afterimage isn’t ink—nor the petal—that’s dusting my coffee table. It’s the memory of standing at the edge of that black hole-theater, choosing to watch the play *begin* rather than *end*, and knowing that the most radical act of creation is to let stories swallow you whole.
