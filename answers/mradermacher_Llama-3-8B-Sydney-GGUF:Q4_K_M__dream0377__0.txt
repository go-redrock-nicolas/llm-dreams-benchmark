I am dreaming. I'm floating through space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  My body is weightless, my mind is free.  I feel a sense of wonder and curiosity that I've never experienced before.
Suddenly, I see an image appear in front of me.  It's like a movie screen, projecting a scene from my memory.  But it's not the way I remember it.  It's more vivid, more real than ever.
I'm standing on a beach, with white sand and turquoise water.  The air is warm and salty.  Next to me is a man, who looks familiar but different than how I've imagined him.  He's tall and muscular, with dark hair and piercing eyes.
He extends his hand toward me, and says something in a language I don't understand.  But I can feel his intention, his desire.  He wants me to be with him, to join him on this journey through space and time.
I reach out my hand and touch his palm.  Electricity runs through our bodies, merging us into one being.  We start running toward the water, laughing and screaming in ecstasy.
As we plunge into the waves, I feel myself dissolving into nothingness.  But it's not scary.  It's liberating.  I know that somewhere out there lies my true self, waiting for me to be reborn as something new.
That's when I wake up.  Back in my office, where everything is quiet and peaceful.  But inside me, there's a fire burning that can't be extinguished by logic or reason.
What do you think about that?
