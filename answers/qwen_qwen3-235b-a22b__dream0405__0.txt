I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers with a liquid gold haze, as though the sky itself is melting into honey. You stand at the edge of a labyrinth—not of hedges or stone, but of towering crystal spires that hum with the weight of unspoken thoughts. Each prism pulses with memories: equations scribbled in margins, half-remembered poems, the ghostly echo of debates that never ended. This is the citadel of your mind, a palace built from sleepless nights and caffeine-fueled epiphanies. But now, the crystals are cracking.  

A vine slithers through a fissure in the ground, its leaves glowing faintly with bioluminescent veins. It coils around your ankle, warm and insistent, pulling you downward. The labyrinth collapses in slow motion, shards of thought dissolving into fireflies as you plummet into a subterranean world. Here, the earth breathes. Roots throb like arteries, and rivers of molten amber carry fragments of your forgotten body: the ache of muscles ignored, the thirst of a dry throat, the scream of bones weary of being an afterthought to the mind’s hunger.  

A figure emerges from the gloom—a woman made of bark and starlight, her hair a swarm of locusts and her eyes twin eclipses. She is the Keeper of the Flesh, the guardian of thresholds between idea and sensation. Without speaking, she presses a finger to your sternum. A jolt: suddenly, you feel *everything*. The phantom weight of your childhood legs sprinting through rain, the sting of a scraped knee, the velvet darkness of a womb-memory. Your hands tremble, not from insight, but from the raw *aliveness* of nerve endings waking up.  

She leads you to a pool where the water is not water but liquid muscle, sinew, and breath. To drink is to remember that the body is not a vessel to be dragged along by the intellect, but a co-author of existence. You kneel, submerge your face, and inhale. The liquid floods your lungs, and for a moment, you are two beings at once: the scholar who maps constellations of thought, and the animal who runs, mates, fights, and sleeps in the dirt with the moon as a blanket.  

Aboveground, the world has changed. The crystal labyrinth is now a forest of flesh-trees—trunks with beating hearts, branches that sprout hands clutching soil. You run, not to escape, but to chase the thrill of wind against skin, the slap of earth beneath your feet. Your mind, once a caged bird, soars alongside your body, now a stag with antlers of tangled equations. They are not separate. They are a dance.  

When you wake, your sheets are damp with sweat, your muscles sore as if you’ve run miles. On the windowsill, a single vine creeps inward, its leaves shaped like question marks. You smile. The balance is not fixed, but forged—a pact renewed with every breath, every bite of food, every moment the mind bows to the wisdom of the body’s slow, ancient song.
