I am dreaming. I am standing in an ancient citadel, its towering limestone walls carved with the scars of countless battles. The air hums with tension, thick as honey, as two delegations face each other in a circular chamber—the Obsidian Hall, where no weapons have ever been drawn, bound by sacred law. 

To my left, the Azure Masari, descendents of sky-worshippers who sail living airships woven from clouds. Their leader, High Windlord Teyva, gleams in robes of shifting cobalt, his voice a susurrus of distant storms. "The Celestial Archives must remain above the clouds," he insists, eyes flashing with lightning. "Earth-dwellers defile sacred knowledge with their touch."

Opposite them, the Obsidian Pact emerges from the citadel's shadowed arches—mountain druids whose skin shimmers with embedded volcanic glass. Their matriarch, Hearthsinger Vural, opens palms that glow like magma cracks. "The Archives hold the Seed-Songs that once made deserts bloom," she thunders. "While you hoard them, our children starve beneath barren skies!"

Between them, the great compromise—the Floating Orchard—drifts lazily outside crystalline windows, its roots curling through cloudbanks, its branches heavy with fruit neither side dares harvest.

I feel the dream shift as I speak:  

*A silver bridge* slithers from my mouth into the hall’s center—not words, but *an actual bridge*, liquid metal forming steps where my voice falls. Gasps ripple as the structure arcs toward the Orchard. "You fear sharing," I say (and now my hands are weaving, pulling threads of mist and stone into the bridge’s railings), "but this tree’s roots drink cloudwater *and* touch bedrock. It is *of* both worlds."  

Pact druids recoil as their stone-god carvings *bloom* with sudden veins of sapphire; Masari grip their cloud-strings as the fibers now bear flecks of obsidian. The compromise is *in them* already.  

The dream fractures beautifully—some nod, others spit curses, but the seed is sown. The bridge hums. Somewhere, an orchard begins to sing.  

And that’s when I notice both factions are staring at *my hands*, which have quietly grown translucent. The dream... is waking.  

(Would you like to see what happens when the first apple is plucked? Or would you prefer another dream entirely?)
