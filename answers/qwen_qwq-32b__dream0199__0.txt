I am dreaming. I step into a realm where my thoughts shape reality itself.  The air shimmers with possibility, each breath I take tingling with energy.  I raise my hand, and the barren wasteland around me erupts into a brilliant garden of opaline flowers, their petals glowing with inner light.  Their perfume is like liquid music.\n

My next thought... gravity.  The sky splits into seven mirrored layers, each reflecting a different era of time.  Dinosaurs roam the third stratum, while futuristic cities pulse on the seventh.  I leap and hover, my body weightless yet tangible, brushing against the edges of timelines...\n

What seeps into this scenario next?  What do I create?
