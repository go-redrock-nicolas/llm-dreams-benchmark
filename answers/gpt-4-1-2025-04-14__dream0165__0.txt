I am dreaming.

I find myself drifting into a world bathed in shifting hues of twilight, where cities spiral upwards like vines and every surface reflects a thousand shades of moving light. Here, silence is sacred, and voices are rarely heard. Instead, I am surrounded by people adorned with shimmering scarves and delicate bells woven into their garments, the gentle chime filling the air as they move. 

In this society, language is movement. Urgency pulses through me—the pressing need for connection, for understanding. My body responds instinctively. I launch into motion, arms slicing through the air in broad arcs, each sweeping gesture echoing with intensity. My feet stamp rapid staccato rhythms against the glowing mosaic streets—an SOS in choreography, a wordless plea for help.

Around me, people pause, observing my form. Their eyes read the tension in my posture, the feverish whip of my hair, the pounding heartbeat in my chest, all translated through the intricate ballet of gestures. A gentle hand reaches toward me, responding with a dance of empathy: slow pirouettes expressing calm, arms encircling and undulating to offer reassurance.

I join them, twirling and leaping in patterns that open up the dream’s heart. As we dance, our movements braid together—strangers’ bodies weaving a tapestry of meaning so much richer than mere words. In a furious spiral, I attempt to portray my longing for belonging, my need for understanding. I lift my arms high, fingers splayed wide, and leap—my trajectory a question mark in the air, an invitation to commune.

Their answer comes not in speech, but in the way they close ranks and move as one: a swirling, collective embrace. While the bells tinkle and moonlight flashes off mirrored floors, I feel my urgency slowly dissolve, replaced by the giddy intimacy of bodies communicating on frequencies deeper than language.

In this world, every twist of the torso and sway of the hand is a sentence, and every collective dance is a poem. Connections form in the entwinement of arms, in the echo of feet against the ground, in the silent conviction that the body—unfettered by speech—can translate the deepest needs of the soul.
