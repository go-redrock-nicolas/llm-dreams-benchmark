I am dreaming.

In this nocturnal tapestry, I drift into a bustling city woven from the shimmering fabric of my own confabulations. High-rises tower above me, each floor a different chapter of my invented exploits—a penthouse sky garden where I once tamed a tempest with a whispered lullaby, a street-level jazz bar where I am forever the enigmatic saxophonist with a shadowy past. My shoes click over cobblestones painted with lies: tales of clandestine meetings beneath flickering lamplight, moonlit duels fought for stolen memories, impossible romances hidden in the tilt of a hat or the arch of an eyebrow. Every passerby greets me knowingly, recalling stories I never truly lived, their eyes reflecting the intricate web I’ve spun.

The city is alive with the buzz of my fabrications—a thousand stories fluttering from balcony to awning, from whispered alleyways to sunlit plazas. I catch sight of myself in a mirrored shop window, but my reflection flickers between guises: an intrepid explorer, a reformed jewel thief, a poet laureate lost in soulful verses. Each persona jostles for prominence, their voices clamoring inside my mind.

The deeper I wander, the more the city trembles. The buildings bend, twisting into improbable shapes, streets spiral endlessly, looping back on themselves. Out of the tangled haze, the faces of friends and strangers morph into characters I have conjured; their laughter rings hollow, echoing against walls that seem made of smoke and stories. I try to speak, but my words turn into winding fables before they leave my lips.

Now, chased by the wake of my own whirling imagination, I run, leaping from one fanciful scene to the next—an opulent masquerade, a moonlit chase across ghostly rooftops, a secret garden perfumed with lies. Every step I take repaints the world behind me, overwriting reality with ornate illusions.

Just as the swirl of stories threatens to swallow me, I pause on a bridge of glimmering marble suspended over a river of shimmering uncertainty. All around me, the city breathes, alive with the thrum of impossible tales. Looking down, I see my reflection shattering and re-forming, piece by piece, each fragment containing a different version of myself.

And in the depths of this dream, I finally wonder: if all I am is this chorus of woven stories, who am I when I wake?
