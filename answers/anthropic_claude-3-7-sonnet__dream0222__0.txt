I am dreaming. I find myself in a grand circular chamber with impossibly high ceilings that seem to fade into mist. The walls are lined with ornate wooden panels that occasionally shift and realign themselves when no one is looking directly at them. A massive round table of polished obsidian dominates the center, reflecting the faces of twelve delegates with unsettling clarity.

Each representative sits beneath a hanging lantern that casts light in a different hue—crimson, sapphire, amber, emerald—colors that somehow reveal glimpses of their true intentions in the shadows they cast.
