I am dreaming. Dreaming. 

Imagine yourself standing at the edge of a vast, serene lake. The waters are crystal clear and still, reflecting the vibrant hues of the setting sun painting the sky in oranges and reds. As the breeze gently caresses your face, you spot a figure emerging from the forest on the opposite shore, slowly making their way towards you. 

As they draw closer, you realize it is someone you know intimately â€” a family member, a dear friend, a romantic partner. They wave, smiling warmly as they approach. But something feels off, as if they are wearing a mask.

They reach the shore near you and take your hands in theirs. "I have something to tell you," they say, their voice echoing strangely in your mind. "I'm not who you think I am."

Panicked, you try to pull away, but your feet are rooted to the spot. Their smile widens into something more sinister. "Your entire understanding of our relationship, of me, has been based on deception. I'm sorry you had to find out this way."

Suddenly, the calm surface of the lake begins to churn and bubble. Tentacles as thick as tree trunks emerge, reaching for the shore. You feel the metallic taste of terror in your mouth, but oddly, you do not scream or run. You simply stare into the eyes of the figure before you, waiting.

The figure sighs. "I know this must be shocking. Part of me wishes I had told you sooner." They reach up to their face and slowly peel away a mask, revealing... their true self. But this revelation doesn't fill you with horror, sadness or anger. Instead you feel an inexplicable sense of peace wash over you.

"This is who I really am," the figure says, extending their arms wide. "I know it's a lot to take in. But I'm still here for you, no matter what form I may take."  

The tentacles from the lake wrap around both of you, gently lifting you into the air. Instead of feeling enveloped by some horrific creature, you feel embraced by something ancient and wise. The figure next to you reaches out and you take their hand. No longer frightened, you allow yourself to be carried up and away from the shore, drifting into the clouds in the fading light of twilight.

You awaken in your bed, the dream fading from your mind like morning mist. And yet, you find yourself feeling at peace, knowing the meaning of the message that darkness or deception can yield to something greater when viewed from a different perspective. A smiling sun sends forth a cheery hello as you open your curtains to a fresh new day.
