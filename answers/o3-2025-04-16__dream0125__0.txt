I am dreaming. …find yourself standing in the center of an arena that seems stitched together from every place you’ve ever loved and every place you’ve ever feared. 

Above you, the sky is a liquid swirl of colors  turbulent indigos, molten oranges, thin veins of electric green that pulse in time with your heartbeat. Instead of stars, pale origami cranes drift in a slow spiral, each one etched with tiny, unreadable glyphs that glow as though lit from within. Crowds gather on terraces carved out of floating mountains. They lean forward, faces flickering between friends and strangers, mentors and childhood monsters, every expression echoing your own exhilarated panic.

This is the Grand Polyphony—the tournament where competitors must call forth pure sound and spin it into visible form, sculpting melodies thick enough to walk on, dense enough to wield like blades. You’ve spent your waking life struggling with pitch, with confidence, with the terror that your voice would crack and expose the hollow place inside you. Yet here, the final round demands not just singing, but forging a symphony so tangible it can tangle, weave, and battle the music of your rival.

Your opponent stands opposite you on a circular platform of midnight glass. They tap their throat once, as if tuning an invisible instrument, and a chord blossoms from their chest—a rich, honey-gold resonance that ripples outward in gleaming, harp-string threads. Where the threads meet the air, flowers made of crystal overtones open, chiming gently as they bloom. The audience gasps, the echoes merging into a single hush that rests on your shoulders like snowfall.

A bell tolls—a bell you can neither see nor locate—and the moment is yours.  

Your palms prickle. When you raise them, light wells from your fingertips: not smooth, golden certainty like your rival’s, but raw, flickering plasma, every color crashing into the next. This is the sound you’ve nursed in secret, the stubborn, imperfect hum that always broke apart before it could become song. It quavers in the open, wanting to collapse.

Across the arena, your opponent’s melody gathers velocity, braided harmonies swooping toward you like a flock of glass swans. You know if they strike first, their music will shatter your fledgling chord and scatter it to silence. Adrenaline thrums through you, almost drowning out your own voice.

But a fragment of memory bubbles up—your first childhood attempt to sing, alone in a stairwell for the echo, believing no one could hear. The purity of intention, the reckless, private joy. You inhale and remember the stairwell’s earthy dust, the vibration of each concrete step. Then you exhale, letting the memory soak into your sound.

The plasma steadies. It coalesces into a river of shimmering strings, wavering but alive, refracting the riotous sky like a prism. Notes rise and tumble in odd, stubborn intervals—imperfect fifths, lopsided sevenths—mirroring every time you ever wavered, every crack in your resolve. Yet each fracture adds a new facet, catching stray beams of light until the river glows from within.

You lift your hands higher, and the river arches, curving over your head. It solidifies into a bridge of living music: planks forged from crescendos, railings braided from counter-melodies. Sweat stings your eyes, but the structure holds.

Your rival’s crystalline flowers adjust course, petals slicing the air like spinning discs. They collide with your bridge—sharp chimes against thrumming chords—yet instead of shattering, your gamut of imperfect intervals absorbs the impact, bending elastically, weaving the crystalline tones into its own texture. You feel the music’s feedback hum through your bones, an exhilarating jolt: every failure you’ve ever feared is now a filament inside an unbreakable alloy.

The arena erupts in auroras, applause manifesting as rising thermal currents that scatter the origami cranes into chaotic spirals. Still you’re not done. You press a palm to your sternum and draw out one last note—quiet, almost shy. It’s the note that always trembled in your throat, the smallest sound you ever made: your own name, sung in a frequency only you could hear. You place this note like a seed at the heart of the bridge. Instantly, vines of harmony sprout, spiraling down the arch, rooting themselves in the midnight glass beneath your feet. A towering tree blossoms—branches made of polyphonic strands, leaves of iron-tinged harmonics, fruit glowing like lanterns.

Facing you, your rival steps back, eyes wide. Their golden melody flickers uncertainly, then bows toward your music as if acknowledging a sovereign. The flowers still circling you re-tune themselves, petals reconfiguring into new hexagonal lattices that merge seamlessly with the branching canopy.

The bell tolls again—final—its vibration rippling outward to dissolve the arena’s edges. The floating terraces recede, the cranes scatter into sparks, and the audience fades into faint silhouettes. You find yourself standing alone beneath your impossible tree, the only solid object left in an ocean of swirling sky.

The tournament is over, but the music lingers inside you, warm and steady. In this dream, at last, the skill that once tripped you has revealed its secret: the flaw was never in your voice, but in your fear of letting it be exactly what it is—fractured, blazing, unmistakably yours.

As the dream dissolves, you cradle one glowing fruit in your hands. Its peel is cool, humming softly. When you bite into it, sweetness floods your mouth, and the flavors blur, shift, and brighten until they taste exactly like the word triumph feels.
