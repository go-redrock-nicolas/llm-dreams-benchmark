I am dreaming. 

In the dream, I find myself standing atop a towering, jagged mountain peak. The wind howls around me, its icy fingers clawing at my face, and the sky above is a deep, foreboding mass of storm clouds, illuminated sporadically by jagged bolts of lightning. My heart pounds in my chest, and my hands are slick with sweat as I grip the rough, cold stone beneath me.

I gaze down into the abyss below, a bottomless chasm of swirling mist and smoldering lava, and my stomach churns with vertigo. But I can't look away, as if drawn to the face of pure, unadulterated fear. Every instinct screams for me to flee, and yet, I feel strangely compelled to stay, to face whatever lies within the dream's grasp. Could this be the crisis I’ve been running from?

Below me, on the brink of the precipice, I see something move.

At first, it is only a fleeting shadow, a vague, shapeless form that flickers in and out of view. But as I strain my eyes and focus hard, it takes shape. It is a creature, a beast unlike anything I have ever imagined or seen before. It is colossal, its body composed of jagged edges and dark, shimmering scales that catch the lightning's eerie glow. Its eyes are two brilliant, red orbs that bore into my very soul, causing my pulse to quicken.

The monster roars.

A sound of pure fury, a cacophony that shatters the calm of the heavens and rumbles through my bones. It is the sound of despair and the end of the world, the kind of sound that makes you question everything. The beast rises, stretching its massive form, now as wide as the mountain is high. Its girth is something too massive to behold, and its movements are a symphony of destruction.

I hear voices.

At first, it is a murmur, a faint, distant hum that grows stronger as the beast's anger intensifies. I realize these voices are the people I love, the people I care about the most. They are pleading, begging me to do something, anything. I feel their despair, their helplessness, and it tears at my very core. But their voices are drowned out, lost in the beast's roar, and I realize, in that moment, that I am alone in this fight.

The beast draws closer.

It moves with impossible speed, its massive body capable of covering the ground with a single, earth-shaking step. The ground beneath me trembles, and I can see the faint outline of its claws breaking through the stone, leaving deep ruts as it climbs. The sight is terrifying, but it spurs me into action.

I turn, scrambling on hands and knees, my back to the creature as it comes closer, my body a blur of panic. I reach into the very core of myself, summoning all the courage and wisdom I have. The wind lashes at me, mocking my efforts, but I press on. The faces of my loved ones flash before my eyes, their words of encouragement echoing in my mind. I will not let them down.

I reach for a worn, leather-bound book that materializes in my hand.

It is the map to my salvation, the answers to questions I didn’t even know I had. With trembling fingers, I open it, and the pages fly open, filled with intricate patterns and ancient runes glowing faintly in the storm’s light. The words on the pages are a language I’ve never spoken before, but in this moment, I understand every bit of it.

The beast sees the book.

It sees it, and its rage doubles. But I do not let it deter me. I focus, ignoring the raw adrenaline coursing through my veins. I trace a complex, intricate symbol on the mountain’s craggy surface with the tip of my finger. The ground beneath me trembles and shifts in response to my touch, and with one last burst of willpower, I slam my hand down on the symbol.

The beast roars one last time. A final, titanic roar that seems to shake the very heavens, and then—it is gone.

The dream fades.

In its place, I find comfort. The storm calms, and the faces of my loved ones return, smiling, safe, and secure. I feel their gratitude, their relief, and my gratitude, my relief.

I wake up.
