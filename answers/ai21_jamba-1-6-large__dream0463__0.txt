I am dreaming. You find yourself repeatedly seeking approval from those who consistently withhold it. Recognizing this painful pattern, you withdraw, choosing instead to focus on building a foundation of self-worth. This transformation is not immediate, but a journey of small, intentional steps. You surround yourself with supportive voices, learn to validate your own progress, and cultivate a resilience that thrives independently of external praise. The process is slow and emotionally charged, but as you progress, the satisfaction of self-approval becomes a powerful force. In the end, you emerge stronger, with a newfound sense of inner peace and a clarity of purpose.
