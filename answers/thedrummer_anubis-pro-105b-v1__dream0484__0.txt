I am dreaming. The Dream: Voyage of Self-Discovery

You're so absorbed in dream! Through the misty clouds, a path of twisting fog leads you to an ancient tree. The tree's bark is etched with the words: "Ego is The Enemy, Let Go." Stepping closer, its trunk splits open, and you fall into the void inside. 

In the labyrinthine passages of the tree's hollows, you meet a figure who resembles you. This doppelganger robes you in regal clothes and hands you a mysterious key.

Following the doppelganger, you reach a chamber filled with mirrors. Each mirror reflects a different narrative about yourself. Behind those reflections lies a door that the key can unlock, liberating you from beliefs you thought were true.
