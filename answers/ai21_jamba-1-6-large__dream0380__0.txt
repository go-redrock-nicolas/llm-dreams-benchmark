I am dreaming. I am facilitating a discussion where diverse perspectives need to be heard, but some voices dominate while others remain silent. Creating space for inclusive participation, I gently yet firmly guide the conversation, ensuring every participant feels heard and valued. I implement structured techniques such as hand signals or a talking stick , allowing each person to contribute without interruption. Setting clear expectations for respectful dialogue, I encourage quieter members to share their thoughts, validating their perspectives as integral to the collective understanding.
