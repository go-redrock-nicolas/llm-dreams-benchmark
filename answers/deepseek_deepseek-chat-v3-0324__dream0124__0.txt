I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers like liquid mercury, refracting light in impossible angles—not forward, but *backward*, unraveling like a forgotten thought. The ground beneath your feet isn’t solid, nor is it soft; it’s a vast membrane of quicksilver, rippling as if your footsteps have already happened and the earth is merely catching up. You blink, and your eyelids snap open *before* you remember closing them.  

A tree stands before you—or perhaps it is un-growing. Its branches slither inward, leaves dissolving from gold to green before retreating into buds that have long since ceased to exist. You watch in dizzy fascination as birds fly in reverse, their songs assembling from echoes into melodies, into silence. Their feathers gleam iridescent, but only for a moment before the colors fracture and reverse into nothingness.  

You try to speak, but your voice comes first—a murmur of sound—and then your lips form the words. It feels like unraveling a sentence from its punctuation. The wind laughs at you in gusts, inhaling where it should exhale, and the horizon is a slow-motion reel of the sun un-setting, the sky bleeding from twilight into midday brilliance.  

You take a step forward—or was it backward? The concept blurs. A river flows uphill, splashes coalescing back into the current, droplets defying gravity as they rise like scattered beads returning to a broken necklace. Pebbles roll away from your touch before you've even reached for them, predictions of actions not yet taken.  

A figure flickers at the edge of your vision. You turn—no, you will turn. The anticipation of motion comes *after* the movement. The figure is a silhouette woven from shadow and absence, watching you with eyes that only exist once you've looked away.  

*"To walk here,"* the figure murmurs, its voice echoing from the future into the present, *"you must first arrive. To speak, you must remember the words before they leave you."*  

The world pulses, breathing in reverse. You take a breath out, and oxygen floods your lungs. You close your eyes to open them.  

And then you wake—  
—or was it the other way around?
