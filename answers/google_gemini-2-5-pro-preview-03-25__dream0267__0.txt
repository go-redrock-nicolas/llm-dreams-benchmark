I am dreaming. My thoughts begin to swirl around the actions I've taken and their effects on another person. I can see the damage I've caused, like ripples spreading across a still pond after a stone is thrown. Yet, strangely, the expected pangs of guilt, the heavy cloak of shame, the sharp sting of remorse â€“ they are simply not there. It's as if those emotional responses, usually so quick to surface, are locked behind an unyielding door somewhere deep within me.

I observe this emotional void with a detached curiosity, much like a scientist examining a peculiar specimen under a microscope. There's a perplexing emptiness where regret should reside. The space feels echoey, vast, and strangely serene. It's not a cold indifference, but rather a profound disconnect, a severance from the anticipated emotional consequence. I turn the situation over in my mind, exploring its facets, trying to understand this unusual lack of feeling. Why isn't the weight of my actions pressing down on me? Why does the reflection of the harm caused seem like a distant image, viewed through a reversed telescope?

This absence isn't relief, nor is it defiance. It's more like a neutral space, a calm eye within a storm I know logically exists around me. I ponder this internal landscape, this unexpected tranquility where turmoil should be. It's a puzzle, this missing piece of the emotional spectrum. The dream state allows me to float within this peculiar sensation, examining it from all angles without judgment, simply observing the strange peace that has settled where a storm of regret ought to rage. It's a landscape of quietude in the face of consequence, a baffling but undeniable feature of this particular dreamscape.
