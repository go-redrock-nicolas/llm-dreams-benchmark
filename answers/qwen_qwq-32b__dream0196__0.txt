I am dreaming. I am in a grand, crystal palace, its spires piercing a starless indigo sky.  The air hums with a frequency that makes my teeth vibrate.  I walk down a corridor lined with mirrors that flicker like liquid silver, each reflection showing me wearing a different mask - a porcelain cat's face, a mask of flickering flames, one that shifts into my grandmother's face before melting away.  A voice, resonant and honey-thick, calls out: "There's a performance to prepare for."  It's the voice of the departed diva, Lila Voss, whose famously cursed role I now must inhabit.  The mirrors all fracture at the edges, and through the cracks I see the audience below: thousands of shadowy figures with eyes like smoldering coals, their faces shifting between human and grotesque.  The stage beckons, but to reach it I must cross the Obsidian Steps, each tread a black mirror that might swallow me whole.  Above, a pendulum swings - not of steel, but of solidified time, each swing erasing a second of my memory.
