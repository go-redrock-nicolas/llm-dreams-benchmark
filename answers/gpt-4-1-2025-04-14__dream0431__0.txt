I am dreaming.

A soft, otherworldly light filters down through the ceiling of a vast and silent cavern, the walls encrusted with crystals that pulse faintly in rhythm with my heart. I stand on a bridge of glass that hums beneath my feet, arching over a lake so still it seems to hold every reflection—my face, my hurts, a montage of memories projected in the surface rippling around me. 

In my right hand, I clutch a small object: an ancient stone, smooth and palm-warmed, inscribed with the names of old injuries and resentments. It is heavier than it looks, latent with every word unsaid and every moment I have recoiled in fear or pride. 

Shapes begin to stir in the haze—a procession of people I have loved or fought or lost. Their faces flicker with ache and lesson, unfamiliar and intimate all at once. I reach toward them, my hand trembling with the compulsion to hold on, even as I know the stone pulls me downward.

In the dream, I allow myself to feel the weight at last, to sink into the memory of pain without flinching or rushing to blame. The cavern seems to deepen, the echoes of my own breath or regrets stretching into tunnels too dark to see the end. 

Then I hear it—the sound of water, soft and persistent. It laps at my feet, cool and forgiving, urging me toward the lake’s edge. There, I kneel, pressing the stone to my heart. My chest aches at the rawness, but the pain feels honest, fertile—as if hurt, confronted gently and without judgment, could become a kind of nourishment.

“I forgive,” I whisper, not to the faces gathered, not just to the world and the lingering shadows, but directly to myself—a bitter, frightened self who has clung to wounds as proof that love is dangerous.

The stone dissolves in my hand, melting into liquid stardust that drips from my fingers into the lake. The water glows brighter, dispersing colors across the walls and faces, and a breeze brushes my cheek, soft as absolution.

As the cavern brightens, the procession dissolves, leaving an expanding sense of peace, of openness. My hands are empty, but my heart feels lighter—spaces once filled with grievance now open to possibility.

In this dream-space, I realize that forgiveness is not forgetting, nor condoning, but choosing, moment by moment, to set down the burdens pulled from the past—so that my feet may carry me fully into love in the waking world.
