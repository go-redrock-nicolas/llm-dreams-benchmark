I am dreaming. A world of poison and venom is thus born, one where dreams are dragged into stark clarity, and the edges of consciousness fray away. Think of your deepest fear, and it shall bloom right in front of you, imbued with the unmistakable sheen of your own private abyss.

It is an unstructured landscape of many dark colors, the air heavy with moisture and unknown scents. Cold stones and rough bark press against your skin as you navigate the entrails of this perplexing world, your body feeling heavier and heavier.  Only the faint light from strange, luminescent flowers guides your path. Your breaths become slow and deep as you try to inhale life through the scent of damp earth and lush foliage.

In the midst of this solidifying void, you see an ancient tree with gnarled roots deeply entrenched in the ground. They hold the key, they are the anchor of this world. Your eyes follow the sinuous, winding lines of age-old bark, tracing the tree's many scars, until you reach its branches that stretch out like desperate fingers grasping for hope.

You let your imagination envelop the environment and with it comes a vibrant display of lights. The eerie glow from the flowers that once barely illuminated your path intensify, casting kaleidoscopic reflections on the surrounding foliage. Soft rays of light break through the sheer canopy above, lending an otherworldly aura to the tree.

And then, something more familiar, yet unexpected happens. From the upper branches, a shower of vibrant butterflies unfurls, a fluttering cascade of iridescent wings, as if the tree has suddenly come to life. They swarm around you, a tender tornado of colours, creating a painting, an ever-evolving, living image of beauty, grace and utter serenity.

Your senses are flooded with ephemeral touches of delicate wings brushing against your skin, a gentle whirlwind of life bursting with energy and hope, and you are at the center of it all. The fear that seemed to choke you is replaced by awe and wonder. In this place of your deepest fears, you discover the birthplace of dreams.

The luminescent creatures guide you through this enigmatic world, leading you towards the roots of the tree. As you reach out, you realise they are not roots but a threshold, a bridge towards waking. The butterflies settle down on every inch of your skin, covering you in a living, vibrant armour, preparing you to face the challenges of the waking world.

With this dream imprinted in your mind, you are reminded to protect the delicate balance of your capacity. You learn to set realistic boundaries, allowing yourself to be anchored yet liberated, guided by the lessons this surreal journey whispered into your heart. From the depths of this darkest abyss, you rise, reborn, draped in a robe of shimmering butterflies, ready to transform your reality.
