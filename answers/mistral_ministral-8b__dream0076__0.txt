I am dreaming. The air is thick with anticipation, the kind that clings to your skin like a second layer of sweat. I stand backstage, the hum of the crowd outside my dressing room a distant roar, a symphony of expectation. The stage lights are dimmed, casting long, dramatic shadows that dance and flicker like phantoms. The scent of makeup and stage dust fills my nostrils, a heady mix that makes my heart race.

I glance at the mirror, my reflection staring back at me with wide, anxious eyes. The costume I'm wearing is a masterpiece, a shimmering cascade of silk and lace that seems to move of its own accord. It's a dream within a dream, a testament to the creativity and artistry that has gone into this moment. But beneath the glamour, I feel a cold tendril of fear. This is it, the moment I've been training for, the culmination of years of dedication and sacrifice. And yet, something feels... off.

The door to the dressing room creaks open, and in steps my manager, her face a mask of concern. "You okay?" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper. I nod, but my smile feels forced. She hands me a small, velvet pouch. "Just in case," she says, her eyes darting to the stage. I take it, my fingers brushing against the smooth fabric. Inside, I find a small, intricate pendant, a tiny compass with a single, gleaming diamond at its heart. It's a gift from my mentor, a symbol of guidance and protection.

As I slip the pendant around my neck, the crowd outside lets out a collective gasp. The stage lights flicker, and for a moment, the world goes dark. When the lights come back on, I see it. A figure standing center stage, a silhouette against the bright lights. It's a woman, her form ethereal, her eyes glowing like twin moons. She holds a single, burning candle, its flame casting eerie shadows on the walls.

Panic surges through me, but I push it down. This is my moment. I take a deep breath, steeling myself for what's to come. I step out onto the stage, the crowd's roar deafening in my ears. The woman turns to face me, her eyes meeting mine. There's no malice in her gaze, only a profound sadness.

"Who are you?" I ask, my voice steady despite the turmoil within me.

She smiles, a gentle, sad smile. "I am the stage," she says, her voice like distant thunder. "And you are about to make history."

The crowd goes wild, their cheers drowning out the woman's words. I take a deep breath, the pendant heavy against my chest. I know what I have to do. I close my eyes, and when I open them again, the stage is mine. The woman is gone, but her presence lingers, a reminder of the power I hold in my hands.

I take a deep breath, and the world falls away. The stage is my playground, the crowd my audience. I am a dancer, a singer, a storyteller. I am a dreamer, and this is my dream. The lights dim, and the music begins. The world watches, their hearts pounding in time with mine. And as I dance, I know that no matter what happens, this moment will be etched into the annals of history. This is my dream, my story, my stage. And I will not let it end in tragedy.
