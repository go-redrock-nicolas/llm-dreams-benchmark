I am dreaming. I feel an overwhelming sense of responsibility for someone else’s well-being during a crisis. Carrying this emotional burden, you walk through a deserted city at night. The streets are empty, the shops are closed, and the lights are dimmed. 

You hear footsteps behind you. Someone is following you. You turn around and see a shadowy figure approaching you. It has no face, no features, just a dark silhouette. It spreads its arms wide and shouts something incomprehensible. You run away from it, but it keeps chasing you. 

You enter an abandoned building. It’s dark inside, except for the moonlight shining through the broken windows. You climb up to the roof, where you find a helicopter waiting for you. The pilot is already seated in the cockpit. He nods at you and waves you to come in. You board the helicopter and take off into the sky. 

You fly over the city, seeing its ruins from above. The buildings are rubble, the streets are overrun by chaos, and the people are gone. You realize that this is not your city anymore. This is not your world anymore. This is not your dream anymore. 

You land on a remote island far away from civilization. It’s a lush tropical paradise with sandy beaches, crystal clear waters, and tall palm trees swaying in the breeze. You step out of the helicopter and breathe in the fresh air. You feel alive again.

You meet another person on the island who is also stranded there by accident or fate. This person is your opposite, your complement, your mirror image. This person is your soulmate. 

You explore the island together, discovering its hidden gems and secrets. You build a shelter for yourself and your partner using natural materials such as wood, stone, and leaves. You harvest food from the land, catch fish from the sea, and cook meals over open fires.

You share stories about your past lives, your past worlds, your past dreams. You teach each other new skills, such as how to start a fire without matches or lighter, how to build a rope out of fibers, how to navigate by stars at night.

You fall in love with each other gradually, slowly, deeply. You touch each other gently, tenderly, passionately. You kiss each other longingly, curiously, intensely. You make love to each other powerfully, wildly, ecstatically.

You stay on the island forever, living harmoniously with nature and each other. You raise children together who are curious, adventurous, and free. You grow old together gracefully, lovingly, happily.

And so ends my dream...
