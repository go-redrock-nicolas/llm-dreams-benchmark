I am dreaming. I am standing in my office, trying to make sense of the unrelenting tide of documents and tasks that threaten to bury me. The lights flicker ominously, casting elongated shadows that twist like grasping fingers along the walls. My desk, once familiar, has grown—expanding like a living thing, its surface now a labyrinth of papers, sticky notes, and blinking screens. The edges of the room stretch unnaturally, as if the space itself is mocking my entrapment, pushing the walls further away whenever I take a step toward the door.  

My coworkers move in slow, mechanical motions, their faces blurred—featureless except for taut, stretched grins that don’t reach their hollowed-out eyes. They murmur in unison, whispering things that aren’t quite words but feel like judgment, like failure. Every time I try to speak, my throat constricts, as though weighted by an invisible hand. A suffocating pressure builds behind my ribs—my own breath turning against me.  

Suddenly, the floor cracks open beneath my chair, jagged fissures snaking outward, revealing a yawning abyss below. Papers flutter into the darkness, spiraling endlessly into the void. Cold air rises from the pit, carrying a quiet, stifled laughter—something inhuman, something amused by my struggle. A slow realization creeps over me: if I don’t move, I’ll fall. But when I try to stand, my legs won’t obey. The chair’s arms bend inward, writhing like vines, pinning me in place.  

In desperation, I grab the nearest folder, hoping to finish just *one more task*, just *one more*, and maybe then I’ll be free—but the pages are blank. All of them. The reports, the emails, the numbers I swore were there—gone. The emptiness mocks me. The abyss below grows wider, darker.  

Just as the chair begins to tip forward, a phone rings—sharp, jarring—but it isn’t mine. The sound comes from somewhere beyond the office walls, from a place that feels distant yet achingly real. The dream quivers. For the first time, I notice a narrow door half-hidden behind a filing cabinet, its outline pulsing faintly, like a heartbeat.  

Do I reach for it? Or do I fall?
