I am dreaming.  

The world around me is a city stitched together from forgotten eras—a labyrinth of marble towers with roots like mangroves, their foundations submerged in ink-black water. The sky pulses with three moons, each fractured, their cracks glowing like molten opal. A wind hums through the streets, carrying whispers in languages that taste of rust and honey. I am weightless here, a shadow drifting between moments, until I see *them*: a figure standing at the edge of a chasm that wasn’t there a heartbeat ago.  

They wear a coat woven from storm clouds, their face obscured by a mask of shattered glass. In their hands, they clutch a map drawn in blood, its edges dissolving into smoke. Below, the chasm writhes—a seething mass of clockwork gears and drowned cities, where cathedral bells toll in reverse. The figure hesitates, then steps forward, their boots hovering just above the abyss.  

I *know* they’re about to fall.  

But not because of the chasm.  

Because I see what they cannot: the map’s missing piece, a secret etched into my ribs like a birthmark. The blood they’ve traced to this moment is a lie. The path they follow leads not to salvation, but to a door marked *“Never-Enough,”* a prison of infinite hunger. I feel the weight of their error like a stone in my throat. They’re fleeing a fire they think is chasing them, but the flames are behind *me*—a library of burning books, each page a memory they’ll never recover.  

Do I speak?  

My voice in this realm is a cello string stretched taut. To intervene would anchor me here, tether my soul to their choice. But their mask cracks, and through the splinters, I glimpse an eye—wide, fever-bright, *familiar*. A sibling? A stranger? A version of myself I abandoned? The gears below scream, hungry for flesh.  

I surge forward, a comet of urgency, and press my palm to their chest. A vision erupts: not words, but a taste—rotten honey, the ache of a phantom limb, a child’s laughter echoing in a coffin. They stagger, the map igniting in their hands. The chasm yawns wider, its hunger now directed at me.  

The last thing I see is their face, finally bare: a mosaic of every choice I’ve ever fled.  

Then the dream fractures.  

I wake gasping, my sheets soaked in the scent of burnt paper, my mind clawing at the edges of the question that lingers like smoke:  

*Did they jump… or did I?*
