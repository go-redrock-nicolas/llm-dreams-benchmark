I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the precipice of a luminous city built entirely of memories. The buildings shimmer like mercury, constantly shifting forms - one moment a childhood home, the next a cathedral never visited yet somehow familiar. The sky above isn't one color but a tapestry of emotions: swirls of deep indigo confidence, streaks of crimson determination, and clouds of silver responsibility.

People with faces both familiar and strange gather around me in a circular plaza. Their expressions flicker between fear and hope as the ground beneath us trembles rhythmically. Each vibration sends ripples through the architecture, threatening to dissolve everything into nothingness.

"What should we do?" they ask in voices that overlap like waves. Their eyes—some blue as forgotten promises, others amber like suspended time—look to me with expectation heavy as ancient stones.

I realize I'm wearing a coat made of whispers, each pocket containing a different solution. As I reach into the first, I feel the cool smoothness of a crystal key. The second holds seeds that hum with potential. The third contains nothing but light that spills between my fingers.

The trembling intensifies. In the distance, a clock tower counts backwards, its hands spinning with impossible speed. I understand with dream-logic certainty that when it reaches zero, this world will either solidify into something permanent or dissolve forever.

I step forward, my decision crystallizing even as the world around me remains fluid. The weight of their collective gaze becomes not a burden but a foundation beneath my feet, steady and strong amid the chaos.
