I am dreaming. I find myself standing atop a glass tower that spirals endlessly into swirling violet clouds. Looking down at my hands, they shimmer with an ethereal, mercury-like quality - the same hands that I know caused devastation, though the specifics hover just beyond my dream-memory's reach. The peculiar thing is the hollowness where guilt should reside; instead there's only a crystalline clarity, like a frozen lake reflecting a winter sky.

As I contemplate this emotional void, the glass tower beneath my feet begins to ripple like disturbed water. Each ripple carries fragments of the harm I've caused - echoes of tears, whispers of pain, shadows of broken trust - yet they slide off my consciousness like rain on polished marble. The rational part of me understands these should wound my soul, but in this dream-state, I feel only a cool detachment, almost fascination.

The violet clouds descend, wrapping around me like silk scarves, and within their folds I see faces - some contorted in anguish, others frozen in betrayal. Still, no remorse penetrates my dream-self's armor. Instead, there's an almost transcendent sense of being beyond moral constraints, as if I'm watching a play where I know the ending but feel no investment in the characters' fates.

The most unsettling aspect isn't the harm I've caused - it's the perfect, pristine peace I feel about it. Like a mirror untouched by the horrors it reflects, my dream-self remains unmarred by conventional emotional responses. This detachment feels simultaneously liberating and terrifying, like flying too close to a sun that can't burn you.

As the dream deepens, I begin to question whether this emotional void is itself a form of punishment - to be forever separated from the basic human capacity for regret, floating in an endless sea of unfeeling observation. Yet even this philosophical pondering creates no ripple in my serene detachment.

The violet clouds continue their dance, and I remain suspended in this state of perfect, terrible calm.
