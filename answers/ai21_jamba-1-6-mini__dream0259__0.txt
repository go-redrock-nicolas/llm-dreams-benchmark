I am dreaming. In the dream, I am standing in a vast, desolate field under a stormy sky. The air is thick with an electric tension, and the ground beneath my feet is wet and muddy. I am barefoot, and the cold earth seems to leech the heat from my body. I can hear a distant rumbling, but it’s hard to tell if it’s thunder or the resonance of my own heartbeat.

My hands are empty, but not for long. I feel a familiar weight in them, and I look down to see a delicate, fragile object—a small clay vase I made long ago. It’s a symbol of something precious, something I’ve nurtured and cherished. But the surface is cracked, and as I roll it gently in my palms, I hear a faint crackling sound. The cracks widen, and I feel a deep ache in my chest. I know this object is about to break, and I am powerless to stop it.

Suddenly, I see a figure in the distance. It’s you, or rather, an alter-ego of you—someone I deeply care for. Our connection is unspoken but palpable. You are walking toward me, but the expression in your eyes is distant, almost accusatory. Your footsteps are heavy, as if each step is burdened with a weight I cannot comprehend. My throat tightens, and I can feel the sting of impending tears.

You stop a few feet away from me, and I can see that your own hands are empty now. Your expression shifts to one of profound sadness. I want to speak, to apologize, to explain that this vase was out of my control, but no sound comes out. The tears start to fall silently as you motion to the ground between us. I look down and see shards of the broken vase scattered there. Each piece is sharp, glittering in the dull light of the coming storm.

I kneel down, overwhelmed by the weight of the moment, and begin to pick up the pieces one by one. The glass cuts into my fingers, but I don’t feel pain. All I feel is the profound sense of failure, the weight of the loss, and the deep, gnawing guilt. I look at my hands, bleeding now, and understand that this pain is not just physical. It’s a symbol of the hurt I have inflicted—real or imagined—on those I love.

As I sit there in the mud, cradling the jagged pieces of my mistake, you kneel beside me. Your eyes meet mine, and I see something I wasn’t expecting—not anger, not just sadness, but a quiet resignation. You reach out to touch my hands gently, and your touch is both a delicate caress and a stark reminder of the relationship we are trying to save.

"It wasn’t just the vase," you say. "It was... you." There’s a pause, heavy with unspoken words that fill the space like an invisible fog. I want to argue, to defend myself, but I know that any words would be hollow. I look down at the broken shards again, suddenly struck by how much they resemble the fragments of my own self.

The ground begins to tremble again, and this time I can hear it more clearly, like the low, steady hum of a distant earthquake.
