I am dreaming. I'm trapped in an old, abandoned school building. The walls are damp and covered in thick, dark moss. The air is heavy with the scent of musty books and decay. As I frantically search for a way out, I realize that the doors and windows are all locked or boarded up.

Suddenly, I hear an ominous creaking sound coming from the ceiling. Looking up, I see a large section of it beginning to sag under the weight of something heavy. Dust and debris rain down on me as I dart out of the way just in time. I realize with horror that the rotting support beams are giving way beneath a mountain of old books stacked high above.

Just as the ceiling gives way, releasing a cascade of books and crumbling plaster, I turn a corner and stumble upon a hidden staircase. It leads down into the darkness, and I can hear a faint rustling sound coming from somewhere below.

Cautiously, I descend the stairs, my heart pounding in my chest. The air grows colder and damper as I go deeper into the school's underbelly. Finally, I reach the bottom, and my dream self is confronted by a terrifying sight - thousands of rats, their beady eyes gleaming in the darkness, scurrying towards me from every direction.

I scream and wake up, heart pounding wildly in my chest. Sweat drips down my forehead as I take deep breaths, trying to shake off the vivid nightmare.
