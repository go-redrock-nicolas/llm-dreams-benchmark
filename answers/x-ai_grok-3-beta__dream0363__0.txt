I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me is a surreal tapestry of emotions and surreal imagery, woven from the deepest recesses of my mind. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, endless canyon, its jagged walls painted in shades of crimson and amber, as though the earth itself is bleeding with unspoken rage. The air is thick, heavy with a metallic tang, and a low, guttural hum vibrates through the ground beneath my feet, mirroring the tremor of suppressed anger that has been simmering within me for far too long. 

Above me, the sky is a tempest of swirling storm clouds, bruised purple and black, crackling with veins of electric blue lightning that seem to pulse in time with my racing heartbeat. Each flash illuminates shadowy figures in the distance—faceless, yet hauntingly familiar, embodying every slight, every frustration, every injustice I’ve buried deep within. They stand motionless along the canyon's rim, watching me, their silence louder than any scream. My chest tightens, a pressure building like a dam about to burst.

Suddenly, a piercing wind howls through the canyon, carrying whispers of every harsh word I’ve swallowed, every moment I’ve bitten my tongue. The voices swirl around me, taunting, pressing in closer, until I can no longer hold back the storm inside. My anger erupts with the force of a volcanic explosion, raw and unbridled. My voice tears from my throat in a primal roar, and the ground beneath me splits open, releasing a torrent of molten lava that surges forward, illuminating the darkness with its fiery wrath. The heat scorches my skin, but it’s a cathartic burn, a release of everything I’ve held captive inside.

As the lava flows, it carves a path through the canyon, reshaping the landscape of my dream. The faceless figures begin to dissolve, melting into the river of fire, their oppressive presence no longer holding power over me. My rage transforms into something tangible, something I can see and touch, as the molten stream cools into obsidian, smooth and gleaming under the fractured sky. I kneel and press my hands against its surface, feeling the warmth still radiating from within, and I realize that this anger, though fierce and frightening, is a part of me—a force I can harness and shape rather than suppress.

Breathing heavily, I stand and look out over the transformed canyon. The storm above begins to calm, the clouds parting to reveal a twilight sky streaked with hues of violet and gold. Fireflies—or are they embers?—dance in the air, casting a soft glow over the newly forged terrain. A sense of peace washes over me, mingled with exhaustion, as though I’ve fought a great battle and emerged not victorious, but whole. The anger isn’t gone; it hums quietly now, a reminder of my strength, a spark I can call upon when needed.

In the distance, a bridge of twisted vines and glowing moss begins to form across the canyon, leading to an unseen horizon bathed in mist. I step forward, my footsteps echoing with newfound resolve, ready to cross into whatever lies beyond, knowing I’ve faced the inferno within and survived. The dream shifts, the edges softening like watercolor bleeding into the page, but the feeling lingers—a vibrant, visceral acknowledgment of my own power, reclaimed from the abyss of suppressed emotion.
