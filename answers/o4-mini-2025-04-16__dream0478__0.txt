I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The air around you shimmers with a liquid light, as if the sky itself has melted and been poured into your lungs. You float through a corridor of translucent mirrors, each one rippling with a different moment from your past. You step closer to the first mirror and see yourself as a child, standing in the backyard with dirt beneath your nails and a crooked grin on your face. But this time, the grass glows sapphire, and your grin unfurls into a constellation of fireflies. You realize that the stubborn pride you once wore like armor was actually a coat of tiny luminous blessings—each moment of stubbornness secretly fueling your resilience.  

You drift onward, and the next mirror shifts to a classroom, the chalkboard’s letters dancing upward as if they’re eager to escape. You watch the shy way you raised your hand, heart pounding, and now the voice that trembled through your question rings clear and strong, echoing like a bell through an empty chapel. What you once saw as timidness reveals itself as quiet courage, an inner melody waiting to be heard.  

Further on, the mirrors merge into one vast panorama: the face of someone you loved, frozen in a photograph with tears in their eyes. But here those tears transform into petals of silver orchids, drifting around you in a gentle storm. The heartbreak you carried so proudly suddenly blooms into compassion—an unexpected wellspring of understanding that flows into every future relationship.  

All at once, the mirrors dissolve into stardust, swirling around your feet like the dust of worlds yet to be born. You realize that each fragment of your past—joy, shame, anger, wonder—has been a prism, refracting the light of who you have become. You bend down, cup the stardust in your hands, and feel it pulse with possibility. You open your palms and release it into the sky, watching as your old stories spin into new constellations.  

You wake, but the memory of that dream-light remains in your chest—bright, weightless, and utterly alive.
