I am dreaming. My imagination cut loose from any mundane constraints, I see patterns within chaos.

One disaster after another appears before me: earthquakes shaking cities to their foundations; tsunamis roaring toward vulnerable coastlines; wildfires consuming bone-dry forests; tornadoes tearing across open plains. The disasters pile atop one another in an overwhelming cascade of destruction and chaos.

As director of emergency services, I'm at the center of the maelstrom, coordinating the response. In a command center filled with blinking computer screens and urgently ringing phones, I give orders, my voice steady and clear despite the pounding of my heart. Firefighters, paramedics, police officers race toward danger at my command. Lives depend on my decisions.

But the disasters are too many, too widespread. Our systems strain under the onslaught. Phone lines go down, cutting off communication with teams in the field. Computer systems crash, taking vital information offline. Each failure is like a punch to the gut, leaving me reeling. Keep it together, I tell myself. People are counting on you.

I switch to backup systems, sending runners with messages when all else fails. My team and I scramble to shore up our response as the world crumbles around us. To prioritize. To adapt. Time and again, we find some way through the cascading crises. By luck, ingenuity, sheer stubbornness, we hold the line against the roiling darkness.

The dream flickers, the disasters fade away. Calm descends, but it brings no relief, only a creeping sense of unease. This is the eye of the storm, a fleeting moment of peace before the next wave. I stand atop the command center, gazing out at the twilit world below: a world riven by widening cracks, on the brink of collapse. It needs a firm hand to hold it together. And that hand is mine.

My sense of duty is an iron weight, pinning my feet to the floor of the command center. I can't walk away, not while there's still work to be done. I'll keep fighting to save as many lives as I can, to keep the world from completely unraveling. But beyond that? I have no answers, only an aching uncertainty, a gnawing fear that no matter how hard I fight, eventually I'll fail. And when I do, the darkness will swallow everything.

I jolt awake, pulse racing, chest tight. Around me, the humdrum familiarity of my bedroom. But the dream lingers, a cold shadow over my thoughts. I know exactly what it means, despite its surreal imagery: my fear that no matter how hard I work, how much responsibility I take onto my shoulders, eventually I'll drop the ball. And in my waking life, there are no second chances, no backup systems to save the day. One false step, and everything falls apart.

That's not paranoia, but certainty, a truth that sinks its claws deep into my chest. I've lived my whole life quivering in its shadow, pushing myself to my limits, then beyond, chasing perfection I can never reach. I've never been able to shake it, no matter how much I've tried. The only thing to do is keep my head down, keep pushing forward. Keep fulfilling my responsibilities, no matter the cost.

But I can feel the strain building, the cracks spreading through my psyche. I don't know how much longer I can hold on. I'm dancing on the edge of a precipice, one misstep from tumbling into the abyss. I can only hope that somehow, I find a way through.
