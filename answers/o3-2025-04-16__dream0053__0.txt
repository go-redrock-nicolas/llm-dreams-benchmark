I am dreaming.

I open my eyes to find myself standing at the foot of an enormous spiral staircase, its iron balustrade curling upward into a fathomless gloom like the spine of some colossal serpent. The air tastes of rust and ozone, as though a summer storm brews inside these walls. A single emergency lamp pulses crimson above the stairwell door behind me, its dim glow throbbing in rhythm with my heartbeat. An alarm, distant but insistent, ticks off the seconds like a metronome—each click warns me that the building is no longer a place for human lives.

A low groan rumbles through the foundation. The floor quivers beneath my shoes. I glance down and see hairline cracks spider-webbing across the marbled tiles, the fissures glowing faintly as if they contain molten light. Something deep below is stretching the bones of this place.

I need a way out.

FIRST HAZARD: THE FLOATING ARCHIVE  
The staircase feels wrong—its steps warp and lean under invisible pressure—so I push through a nearby set of double doors. I emerge into a vast library whose shelves drift weightlessly like satellites. Leather-bound tomes orbit an invisible axis, swirling in slow spirals. A single book rips free, flutters open, and splays its pages in front of me. Each line of text rearranges itself into a map: the fire exits, service tunnels, rooftop heliport. Helpful—until the letters squirm, liquefy, and drip off the page like black tar. The map collapses into nonsense.

The floating shelves tilt; heavy volumes rain down. I duck, sprint for the opposite door, and barrel through just as a grandfather clock smashes against the threshold, showering sparks from its fractured brass gears.

SECOND HAZARD: THE ELECTRIC GALLERY  
I find myself in an art corridor lit by flickering fluorescents. The paintings hiss as if alive. Inside a gilt frame, storm clouds churn over a painted sea; lightning lashes outward, and stray arcs snap into the hallway, scorching walls. One bolt kisses a metal detector beside me, and the machine sputters, then explodes in a fountain of blue flame.

A ceiling panel collapses, spewing tangled cables. Electricity dances along the wires, spitting sparks that creep across the damp floor. I spot a row of rubber floor mats intended for construction crews. I leap from one to the next—makeshift stepping-stones away from the current—until I reach a maintenance elevator. The button panel glows a sickly chartreuse. I press “B2—Service Tunnels,” gambling on an exit in the basement.

THIRD HAZARD: THE FLOODED FOUNDATIONS  
The elevator lurches, stops halfway, and the doors crack open to reveal a horizontal river coursing through concrete corridors. Chest-high water gleams gun-metal gray and rushes by with the urgency of a runaway train. Floating on the torrent are office chairs, crumpled blueprints, a desk lamp flickering like a lone lighthouse.

A maintenance catwalk hugs the wall, just wide enough for my soles. I inch along, palms pressed to damp concrete. Below me, something massive bumps the steel support beams—an echoing clang that reverberates in my ribs. A half-submerged EXIT sign winks ahead, bobbing like a buoy. I have to reach it before the water rises further.

I spot a fiber-optic cable dangling overhead, its sheath torn, but the sparking wires inside flare like fireflies: a rope of light. I grab it, swing across a breached section of catwalk, and land by the EXIT door. My feet plunge ankle-deep into frigid water, but the handle turns. I push through into—

FOURTH HAZARD: THE BREATHING ATRIUM  
—a vast greenhouse atrium glowing emerald. Overgrown vines coil around shattered skylights. Ferns as tall as lampposts sway even though no wind blows. The air is thick with floral perfume tinged with rot. Each breath feels heavy, syrupy.

As I tread the mossy floor, the ground heaves beneath me, rising and falling in slow pulses. The building is exhaling. Veins of bioluminescent sap throb underfoot, illuminating a labyrinth of root-covered tiles. Somewhere above, I hear glass cracking: the vines are wrenching the remaining panes free. Shards drift downward like deadly snow.

A path reveals itself—a line of phosphorescent mushrooms leading to a service ladder bolted to a brick column. I sprint, dodging tumbling glazing and thrashing creepers. I climb.

FINAL HAZARD: THE ROOFTOP GAUNTLET  
Moonlight greets me at the ladder’s top as I emerge onto the roof. The city sprawls beyond, lights twinkling serenely, unaware of the chaos below. But the roof itself is a minefield of ruptured HVAC units wheezing scalding steam. Panels of metal flutter in the wind, threatening to slice flesh.

Across the gravel expanse stands a lone door marked “FIRE ESCAPE—ACCESS TO STREET.” Between us, vents belch clouds that shimmer rainbow, refracting moonbeams like oil on water. The temperature swings wildly—arctic near one vent, tropical at the next. I time the rhythm of the steam and break into a sprint.

One burst sears my sleeve; another engulfs my path in freezing mist. I skid on frost, nearly topple, regain footing, and shoulder through the EXIT door.

EPILOGUE: WAKING  
I descend a staircase that feels blessedly mundane: plain concrete, fluorescent tubes, a scuffed handrail. Each step cuts deeper into silence until I reach a green steel door. I push. Cool night air rushes over me, carrying the scent of rain-drenched asphalt and distant traffic.

Behind me, the building groans one final time—a leviathan settling into sleep. Ahead, streetlights shine. Sirens wail far off, but here, for a heartbeat, there is perfect calm.

I step into it—and wake.
