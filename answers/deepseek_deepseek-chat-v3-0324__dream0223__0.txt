I am dreaming. No—I am *inside* the dream, and the dream is alive.  

The sky is the color of a fresh bruise, purpling at the edges where the horizon should be, but there is no horizon anymore. Just smoke, thick and greasy, curling like the fingers of something hungry. The air smells of burning plastic and wet copper, a nauseating cocktail that clings to the back of my throat.  

I’m standing in what used to be a triage center—white tents, order, hope—but now it’s a ruin of overturned cots, blood-smeared tarps, and the low, animal sounds of people in pain. My clipboard is useless. The protocols keep changing, the rules rewriting themselves in my hands. One moment, I’m supposed to prioritize the most salvageable; the next, I’m told to let them all go. The papers dissolve into ash when I try to read them.  

A woman grabs my wrist. Her face is half-shadow, half-light, her eyes too wide, pupils swallowing the whites. "You have to help him," she says, but when I look down, the body at her feet isn’t a person anymore—it’s a tangle of wires and wet red meat, pulsing in time with a sound like a broken heart monitor. *Flatline. Flatline. Flatline.*  

I turn, and the disaster unfolds in every direction. A child sits cross-legged in the middle of the wreckage, stacking bones like toy blocks. A man with no face whispers numbers—casualty estimates, maybe, or codes I should know. The ground shudders, and the tents collapse inward, as if the earth is inhaling.  

Then, the worst part: the realization that I’m not just *assigned* to this. I *built* it. The protocols are mine. The inadequate supplies—my miscalculation. The disaster is breathing, and its breath smells like my own.  

I wake up choking.  

But—no.  

This is a dream.  

I don’t get to wake up.
