I am dreaming. I drift into a vast marble hall whose arched ceilings vanish into mist. Everywhere I turn, pale figures glide past in slow motion, their faces blurred as if seen through frosted glass. They laugh in hushed tones—soft chimes that ripple through the air like fragile glass wind-chimes—but none of their warmth ever reaches me. The floor beneath my feet gleams with liquid silver, and each step sends ripples through the surface, as though the ground itself sighs beneath my weight.

I realize I am not alone, yet I feel an ocean between my heart and theirs. Around me, couples exchange secrets in whispered breaths. Clusters of friends lean into one another with the familiarity of old trees entwining roots beneath the earth. I raise my hand to touch someone’s shoulder, but my fingers pass right through them—cool air, nothing more. Their laughter swirls around me, too bright, too distant; I taste its emptiness on my tongue.

In a corner of the hall, a great clock blooms from the wall—a living thing with twisting copper vines for hands, ticking in irregular rhythms. I approach it and find that instead of numbers, tiny windows line its face. Each window shows a fleeting moment: a child’s first dance with the wind, lovers clasping hands beneath rain, a solitary figure on a windswept beach. I press my palm against one of these windows, and for an instant I feel the pulse of someone else’s life—warmth, fear, joy—then the vision shatters like colored glass.

Driven by a longing I cannot name, I slip out of the hall into a garden built upon a floating island. Blooms of cobalt and ivory unfurl beneath a violet sky, their petals pulsing with quiet luminescence. I wander among them until I find a single white rose, its edges softly glowing. As I cradle it, the petals drift away one by one, carried upward on a breeze made of starlight. Suddenly I’m lifted, hovering between the earth and sky, weightless with hope.

High above the garden, I see a figure standing on a distant ledge—a person whose face is etched in moonlight but whose eyes burn with sincere warmth. My heart cracks open at the sight of them. I call out, my voice echoing like a distant bell, but before they can reply, the rose’s last petal flickers out. The winds of the dream shift, and I begin to fall, tumbling through violet clouds scattered with silver dust.

In that infinite descent, the loneliness that has shadowed me all night dissolves into pure longing. I realize it is this longing—the ache for someone who truly sees me—that shapes the contours of my dreamscape. As I wake, I carry that ache with me, a tender ember glowing in the darkness of morning, reminding me that connection often begins as a promise whispered into the void.
