I am dreaming. I stand atop a glass tower that somehow exists both inside and outside of reality. The sky above churns with impossible colors—purples that feel like whispers, greens that taste of forgotten memories, and a sunset orange that resonates like a cello's final note. My hands grip a console made of shifting light, where emergency dispatch screens flicker and transform beneath my fingertips.

"The western quadrant is flooding," comes a voice through static-filled speakers that seem to grow from the walls like crystal formations. But even as I redirect rescue boats there, the eastern mountainside ignites with blue flame that climbs without consuming, trapping hundreds in a labyrinth of light.

I speak commands into a microphone shaped like a seashell, but my words emerge as butterflies that dissolve before reaching the rescue teams. The communication towers—spires of copper and bone that stretch across the horizon—begin to fold inward like origami, cutting off district after district.

"We've lost contact with Hospital Seven," reports a woman whose face keeps changing, sometimes wearing my mother's eyes, sometimes a stranger's smile. "And the underground shelters report something moving through the ventilation systems."

The map before me breathes like a living thing. Red dots representing trapped civilians pulse like heartbeats growing fainter. When I press my hand to the screen, I feel their fear as physical pressure against my palm.

"Choose," whispers a voice from everywhere and nowhere. "The northern bridge or the southern tunnels. You can't save both."

As I reach for the decision key, the floor beneath me becomes transparent, revealing all the people looking up at me with desperate eyes. Their faces are impossibly clear despite the distance. I recognize each one somehow, though I've never met them.

The communications system wails one final time before dissolving into ravens that circle the control room, their wings leaving trails of static in the air. Each caw translates to a name, a life, a story that might end if I choose wrong.

And still, I must choose.
