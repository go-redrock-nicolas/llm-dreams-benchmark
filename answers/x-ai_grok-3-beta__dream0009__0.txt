I am dreaming. I awaken with a start, my breath catching in my throat as the world around me unfurls like a tapestry woven from the threads of history. The air is crisp, carrying the earthy scent of damp soil and blooming wildflowers, so unlike the sterile, recycled air of modernity. My eyes flutter open to a canopy of towering ancient oaks, their gnarled branches twisting toward a sky painted in the soft lavender hues of dawn. The ground beneath me is a bed of moss, spongy and cool, and as I push myself up, I realize I’m clad not in my familiar cotton pajamas but in a coarse linen tunic, the fabric rough against my skin, tied with a simple leather belt. My feet are bare, feeling every pebble and blade of grass as I stand, a sensation both grounding and foreign.

I am not in my time. There are no hums of electricity, no distant roars of engines, no faint glow of screens. Instead, there is birdsong—melodic and wild, a symphony unbroken by the buzz of modern life. I glance around, my heart pounding with a mix of awe and uncertainty, and see no trace of asphalt or concrete, only a winding dirt path snaking through the forest, barely wide enough for a cart. The realization dawns on me: I’ve slipped into an era long past, a time of simplicity and struggle, where humankind’s imprint on the world is but a whisper.

As I begin to explore, my bare feet tread cautiously along the path, each step kicking up tiny clouds of dust. The forest opens into a clearing, revealing a small village nestled in the crook of a glistening riverbend. Huts of timber and thatch squat low to the ground, their roofs sagging under the weight of time and weather. Smoke curls lazily from crude stone chimneys, and the faint clang of a blacksmith’s hammer rings rhythmically, a heartbeat to this ancient settlement. Villagers move with purpose, their faces weathered and lined by a life of labor, their clothing patched but vibrant with dyes of ochre and indigo. Women balance clay pots on their hips, children chase each other with sticks fashioned into mock swords, and men haul bundles of firewood, their muscles straining under the load. Their language is unfamiliar, a lilting tongue of guttural tones and rolling vowels, yet their wary glances speak clearly enough—I am an outsider.

I need to find my place here, to understand where I am and how I might survive in this alien world. My stomach growls, a sharp reminder of my body’s needs, and I realize I have no currency, no skills to barter with in a time before paper money or digital transactions. My modern knowledge—coding, streaming, social media—is useless in a land where the wheel might be the pinnacle of innovation. I must adapt, learn their ways, or risk being cast out as a stranger with no value. My eyes dart to a nearby field where golden wheat sways under the rising sun, and I see a group of men and women wielding sickles, harvesting with a practiced rhythm. Perhaps there, I can offer my strength, however untested, in exchange for a scrap of bread or a corner to sleep in.

I approach slowly, my hands raised in a gesture of peace, though my heart races with trepidation. A burly man with a beard like tangled brambles notices me first, his grip tightening on his tool as his dark eyes narrow. I mime the motion of cutting wheat, pointing to myself and then the field, hoping my intent translates through the barrier of language. After a tense moment, his expression softens, and he grunts, gesturing for me to join them. Relief washes over me, though I know this is merely the first hurdle in a world that will test me in ways I cannot yet fathom.

As I grasp the borrowed sickle, its wooden handle worn smooth by countless hands, I feel the weight of this new reality settle onto my shoulders. The sun climbs higher, its warmth kissing my skin as sweat begins to bead on my brow. Each swing of the blade is clumsy, my muscles protesting the unfamiliar labor, but I persist, driven by the need to belong, to survive. Around me, the villagers murmur, their tones shifting from suspicion to curiosity, and I catch fleeting smiles from a young girl clutching a bundle of grain, her eyes bright with unspoken questions about the stranger in their midst.

Beyond the field, the river glitters like molten silver, and I imagine the cool relief of its waters after a day of toil. I dream within this dream of learning their songs, their stories, of carving out a life in this forgotten time. But beneath the beauty and simplicity, a quiet fear lingers—how did I come here, and will I ever return to the world I knew? For now, I focus on the task at hand, the rhythmic swish of the sickle, the scent of freshly cut wheat, and the tentative hope that I might find a home in this ancient era, even if only for a dream’s fleeting span.
