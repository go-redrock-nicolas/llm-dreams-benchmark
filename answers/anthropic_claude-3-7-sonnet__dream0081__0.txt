I am dreaming. I'm wandering through the cobblestone streets of an ancient Balkan city, the afternoon sunlight casting long golden fingers between terra-cotta rooftops. The scent of cardamom and grilling vegetables drifts from hidden courtyards as I photograph crumbling Soviet-era monuments beside Byzantine churches. The contradiction of this place captivates me—centuries of conquest and resilience etched into every weathered facade.

Without warning, a distant explosion shatters the tranquility. People scatter from the square like startled birds. My phone buzzes with emergency alerts—borders closing, airports shutting down. The peaceful city transforms before my eyes as military vehicles rumble down narrow streets and civilians rush to gather supplies.

In my small pension, the elderly proprietress frantically translates news broadcasts I cannot understand. Her weathered hands tremble as she presses a small parcel of bread and cheese into my palm. "American? Very dangerous now," she whispers, pointing to my passport.

Night falls with an unnatural quietness. From my window, I watch fires bloom on distant hillsides. The electricity flickers, then fails. By candlelight, I sort through my belongings—what can I carry? What must I leave? The weight of uncertainty presses against my chest like a physical thing.

In dreams, time moves strangely. Suddenly I'm trudging through misty mountain paths with a group of strangers—local students, a Norwegian journalist, an elderly couple from Australia. We whisper in multiple languages, sharing water and fear in equal measure. A teenage girl with bright eyes sketches maps in the dirt, showing forest routes to a neutral border.

The mountain mist parts occasionally to reveal valleys below where convoys move like mechanical centipedes. Someone's hand finds mine in the darkness—human connection transcending our shared terror. We climb higher, where the air thins and breathing becomes a conscious act, each step a negotiation between determination and exhaustion.

At dawn, we reach a ridge where two worlds meet—behind us, chaos; before us, uncertainty. The border is both a physical line and a threshold of hope. Beyond it, I can see orderly fields and the distant promise of safety, though reaching it means crossing an exposed valley under uncertain watch.

In this suspended moment between worlds, I awaken—heart pounding, sheets tangled, the phantom weight of a backpack still pressing on my shoulders.
