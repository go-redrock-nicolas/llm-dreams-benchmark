I am dreaming.

In this hazy, half-lit place, night and day blend together, casting the world into a violet dusk. I stand atop a spiraling staircase of gleaming, translucent crystal—each step sparkling beneath my feet as if lit from inside by slumbering stars. Below me is a vast hall, impossibly big, stretching farther than sight, laid out like a labyrinth of floating platforms. Chaos roars everywhere: a deluge of color, movement, voices, and wailing wind.

Around me, people scurry—some draped in moth-wing cloaks, others with lanterns growing like flowers from their hands. Their faces turn upward; their eyes are heavy with a desperate hope. I see the floods encroaching, rivers of silver liquid swarming up through the glassy tiles, swallowing islands of ground.

A great, many-eyed, serpentine shadow writhes in the storm overhead, hurling down lightning that shatters into prisms and raining gemstone shards. The world is unwinding, and the people need to be anchored.

I draw one deep breath. The violet air fizzes on my tongue like champagne. My voice, when it echoes through the hall, rings bright and strong, the sound splitting the commotion like dawn breaks a nightmare.

"Everyone—gather!" I command, lifting my arm as if to hold back the storm. The lantern-bearers assemble, illuminating pathways where the liquid flood slows and recedes, repelled by their warm, golden glow. The moth-cloaked folk spread their wings, unfurling glittering patterns that mesmerize the menacing shadow; their dance tames its fury, bending it into ribbons that twist harmlessly skyward.

I direct the formation of bridges—arches of crystal rising at my will—linking isolated platforms into a lattice of safety. With every word, every gesture, the chaos bends. The winds soften to a chorus, the shattered jewels reform into glowing orbs, and the frightened faces below resolve into determined, courageous expressions.

At the heart of the hall, where the floor had completely given way, I kneel, planting my palm onto the cold glass. From my fingers, roots of light surge outward, knitting the world together like thread through fabric, binding chaos with luminous order. All around, the people cheer, and the darkness retreats.

I rise, breathless, feeling the charge of possibility in every cell. In this labyrinth spun from dream and crisis, I am both guide and weaver, shaper of the wildest storm—and so, together, we find our way toward calm, beneath the strange and beautiful twilight of my imagination.
