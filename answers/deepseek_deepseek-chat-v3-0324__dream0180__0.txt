I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering plaza under a sky the color of crushed violets. The air hums with the scent of spiced honey and something metallic, like ozone after a storm. Tall, ethereal beings drift past me, their bodies wrapped in flowing layers of translucent silk that ripple like liquid glass. Their faces are elongated, crowned with delicate, branching antlers that glow faintly from within.  

I realize I am in the heart of the Veridian Court, a place of intricate ceremonies and unspoken rules. A guide—perhaps assigned to me, though I don’t remember—whispers in a voice like wind through reeds, *"You must offer the Obsidian Lament at the third gong. To hesitate is to insult."* But the instructions dissolve into fragments before I can grasp them fully.  

The plaza’s center holds a shallow pool of mercury-like liquid, its surface reflecting not our world but another—a swirling cosmos of unfamiliar constellations. Around it, courtiers begin a slow, hypnotic dance, their movements precise as clockwork. I watch, mesmerized, until I notice their eyes keep darting to me. Expectant.  

When the third gong shudders through the air—a sound that vibrates in my bones—I step forward, my heart pounding. A silver chalice materializes in my hands, filled with something dark and shimmering. *The Obsidian Lament.* The guide’s warning echoes in my mind, but panic blurs the details. Do I drink it? Pour it into the pool? Offer it to the tallest figure, whose antlers drip with tiny, chiming bells?  

I choose wrong.  

The moment the liquid touches my lips, the world fractures. The courtiers recoil as one, their silk robes hissing like angry serpents. The pool’s surface boils, and the reflected stars blink out, one by one. The ground beneath me softens, and I sink—not into earth, but into silence. The guide’s voice is the last thing I hear, thick with sorrow: *"You have swallowed their sorrows. Now they are yours to carry."*  

As the dream unravels, I feel the weight of a hundred unnamed griefs settle in my chest, each one a cold, sharp star. And then—I wake.
