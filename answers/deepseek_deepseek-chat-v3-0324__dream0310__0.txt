I am dreaming. Around me, a great many people with copper-colored skin and long, dark, braided hair stand in an immense circle. They're drumming—a deep, rhythmic pulse that reverberates through my bones, through the very earth beneath my feet. The air is thick with the scent of burning sage and sweetgrass, curling upward into the sky where enormous storm clouds boil in shades of purple and indigo.  Lightning flickers inside them, illuminating the scene in brief flashes, like the opening and closing of some cosmic eyelid.

I don't understand the words they sing, but I feel them—they tug at my chest, pulling me into the center of the circle where the fire burns so hot and so bright it is nearly white. The elders, their faces carved with deep lines of wisdom and time, look at me with eyes that glow like molten gold. One extends a hand, offering me a small clay bowl filled with dark liquid that shimmers with flecks of silver—like crushed stars stirred into water.

"Drink," the wind seems to whisper in my ears, though no lips move. 

The moment the liquid touches my tongue, my vision shatters. I see everything—threads of fate weaving between us all, stretching from our hearts into the sky, into the past, into futures that haven't yet been born. I see my ancestors dancing beside me, their forms made of mist and light, laughing soundlessly. The drumming grows louder, faster, until it becomes the heartbeat of the world itself, and the ground trembles in response. 

Then, gently—so gently—the eldest of them places a warm, wrinkled hand on my forehead. 

And I wake.
