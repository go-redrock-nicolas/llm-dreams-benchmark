I am dreaming.

I stand at the heart of a great circular chamber, walls carved from shimmering crystal, their surfaces alive with shifting maps and endless data streams. The air thrums with tension—an invisible tide rising in this impossible place. I sense the weight of billions upon my shoulders, each heart beating in sync with my own trembling pulse.

Outside, the world is fractured. Beneath swirling violet skies, oceans have receded and forests have become memories. Cities glow in clusters of anxious light, separated by stretches of darkness where nothing grows. Here, every drop of water, every mouthful of grain, every matchstick of medicine is precious beyond measure.

Before me stands a dais, transforming moment by moment—sometimes wood, then gleaming steel, then a living vine tangled with digital blossom. Around it are advisors, not quite human, sculpted from hope and fear and whispered voices of those waiting in the silence. Their eyes are galaxies, and their words crackle like static, muffled by urgency.

Demands pour in, never ceasing: a hospital on the edge of collapse, a village waiting for their first bread in weeks, a convoy lost to a sandstorm the color of rust. Every message is a lifeline; every answer a fracture. I reach out, hands trembling but determined, and with a gesture, reroute the nutrient flows—reserves from a distant archipelago to save the sick in a mountain city. Another sweep of my arm, and a hidden aquifer is revealed to a parched valley, its waters dazzling in the minds of those who do not yet know salvation is coming.

With every decision, the room trembles. Faces appear and vanish in the crystal, some weeping in relief, some scowling in bitterness, all fleeting and achingly real. The pressure in my chest tightens, a universe pressing inward. Yet in the pattern of cascading commands, the touch of a thousand choices, faint glimmers of hope start to connect—a shifting mosaic of possibility etched with the light of resolve.

I am neither omnipotent nor omniscient, but in this dreamscape, I feel the flow of resource and need like a symphony of consequence. I see the shape of the world not as it is, but as it could be: new green shoots in barren earth, strangers sharing a ration beneath a fractured sky, a girl raising her eyes as water fills her cupped hands. Each vision fans the embers of my resolve.

Dawn is distant; sleeplessness is a myth here. But as I stretch towards another decision, the air fills not with despair, but with the echo of countless voices—alive, enduring, reaching for tomorrow. Through me moves not just fear, but the deep, adamantine pulse of humanity’s will to survive.
