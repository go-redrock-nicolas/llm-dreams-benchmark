I am dreaming. —I am dreaming.

The world is split between velvet indigo and fluorescent hum, as if day and night are fighting over the streets of my slumber-shadowed city. My footsteps echo—hollow, urgent—across slick asphalt, the smell of rain and electricity thick in the air. A bus rumbles past, golden windows flickering shadows, unaware of the world teetering on the edge.

That’s when the signs emerge—silent portents no one else seems to read. Sirens whimper in the distance, not shrill but more like a plea. A flock of crows churns in nervous loops above, rising into a cloud that blots out the moon. Staticky radio snippets play from open windows: “…please stay calm…emergency protocol…” The ground trembles, a subtle, insistent warning, but people simply keep sipping coffee, scrolling on phones, laughing on street corners.

My heart catches fire with urgent understanding. Something is about to splinter. I rush through the crowd—faces dreamy, unconcerned—and try to shout, but my voice is stolen, carried away on a strange, chill wind. I gesture frantically. My breath turns visible, hanging like ghosts in the air.

With adrenaline crackling in my veins, I burst into a subway station. The fluorescent lights overhead blink a distress code. I leap in front of a uniformed attendant. I grip her arm; her eyes are glassy and far away, as if she’s half-dreaming too. “Something’s coming,” I plead, voice suddenly solid, unfamiliar. “We have to warn everyone.”

Beneath my feet, a faint rumble grows into a shudder. Pipes creak, metal groans. The taste of ozone and danger stings my tongue.

Shadows spill like ink between the tiles. I fumble for the emergency alarm, smashing it with a bone-white fist. Suddenly, the world flickers—time stretches like taffy. All eyes turn toward me, awakening one by one, faces rippling with the slow bloom of realization. An unearthly siren rises; the sound vibrates in my ribs, my teeth, the very marrow of the city. 

Bright, otherworldly lights surge through the tunnels as the dream shifts—imagination unfurling in impossible colors. Now, all eyes are on the horizon, ready for the unknown, together. And I, heart hammering the rhythm of salvation, feel the first stirrings of hope in a world on the cusp of waking.
