I am dreaming. wander through the labyrinthine streets of this vast, unfamiliar city, a place that seems to shimmer with an otherworldly glow beneath a sky painted in hues of lavender and molten gold. Towering spires of glass and obsidian pierce the heavens, their surfaces reflecting distorted fragments of my own anxious face as I pass by. The air hums with a strange, melodic vibration, as if the city itself is alive, whispering secrets in a language I cannot grasp. 

Crowds of ethereal beings glide past me—some with translucent skin that glows like moonlight on water, others with eyes like twin galaxies swirling in their sockets. They pay me no mind, their murmurs blending into a symphony of incomprehensible voices. My heart races as I clutch a crumpled piece of paper in my hand, a note scribbled in haste that reads, “The Obsidian Tower, One Hour.” No address, no map, just those cryptic words burning into my mind. I’ve got sixty minutes, and the weight of urgency presses down on me like a storm cloud ready to burst.

I quicken my pace, my footsteps echoing on the polished cobblestones that gleam like black mirrors underfoot. The streets twist and turn without logic, narrowing into shadowy alleys one moment and unfolding into grand boulevards the next. Neon signs in languages I’ve never seen flicker above doorways, casting surreal light across my path—electric blues, acid greens, and pulsating reds that seem to pulse in rhythm with my own frantic heartbeat. A street vendor with feathers for hair offers me a vial of glowing liquid, muttering something about “finding what’s lost,” but I wave them off, too consumed by the ticking clock in my mind.

As I round a corner, I stumble upon a enormous plaza dominated by a colossal clock tower, its face a chaotic swirl of gears and hands that spin in opposing directions, as if mocking the very concept of time. The numbers on the clock are glyphs, ancient and indecipherable, yet somehow I sense there are only thirty minutes left. My breath hitches. I scan the plaza, desperation clawing at my chest, and spot a floating tram of shimmering crystal hovering just above the ground. It hums with energy, and without a second thought, I leap aboard as it begins to glide forward.

The tram whisks me through the city at a dizzying speed, past gardens of glass flowers that chime like bells in the breeze, over rivers of liquid silver that ripple with ghostly faces staring up at me, and through tunnels of cascading starlight that blind me with their brilliance. I ask a passenger—a figure draped in robes of woven mist—about the Obsidian Tower. Their voice is a haunting echo, reverberating in my skull: “Seek the shadow that defies the sun.” I blink, puzzled, but the tram lurches to a stop before I can ask more, depositing me at the edge of a district where the buildings seem to lean inward, conspiring against the light.

Here, the air grows colder, denser, and I feel the weight of unseen eyes watching me. In the distance, I see it—the Obsidian Tower. It rises like a monolith of pure darkness, a jagged scar against the vibrant sky, absorbing every trace of color and light around it. A shadow that defies the sun, indeed. My legs tremble as I approach, the ground beneath me shifting like liquid ink. The entrance is a cavernous maw, and as I step inside, the world outside vanishes, swallowed by an oppressive silence.

I’m late—I can feel it in my bones, though I have no way to confirm the time. The interior of the tower is a maze of spiraling staircases and mirrored walls that reflect endless versions of myself, each one more distorted than the last. Whispers coil around me, urging me upward, and I climb, my breath ragged, until I reach a chamber at the summit. A figure awaits, cloaked in shadow, their presence both terrifying and magnetic. “You’ve arrived,” they intone, their voice a chorus of a thousand echoes, “but not for the reason you think.”

Before I can respond, the floor beneath me dissolves into a void, and I’m falling—plummeting through layers of dream and memory, the city unraveling like threads of silk around me. My scream is swallowed by the wind as I hurtle toward an unseen abyss, knowing somehow that the meeting was never the point, that the journey itself was the riddle I was meant to unravel. And just as I brace for impact, the world shifts, and I’m somewhere else entirely…
