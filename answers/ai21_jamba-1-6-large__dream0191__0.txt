I am dreaming. The cave around me looms like the open maw of some colossal and ancient beast. Its walls shimmer with faint streaks of ore that pulse faintly, as if alive. The dull boom of shifting rock fills the air, growing louder and louder until it rumbles like the pounding of an earthquake. 

Without warning, the ground heaves beneath my feet, sending me sprawling forward onto the cold, gritty stone floor. The reverberations ripple through my bones, sharp and disorienting. Dust clouds billow up from every crevice, choking my lungs and clouding my vision. To my horror, the dim light from my lantern sputters and flickers as a distinct crack appears along its glass surface. 

A crushing weight presses down on my chest. The only path forward is shrouded in complete blacknessâ€”an abyss that seems to extend forever into the unknown. I scramble to my feet, tattered clothes clinging desperately to sweaty limbs, while panicked visions of being buried alive flash through my mind. 

One final plea reaches my fingertips as a faint, sickly glow escapes from behind me. A distant roar from the earth's bowels drowns out my lingering scream, and the last light is devoured by the encroaching darkness. 

The cave seals shut behind me, trapping me in a crypt of solitude.
