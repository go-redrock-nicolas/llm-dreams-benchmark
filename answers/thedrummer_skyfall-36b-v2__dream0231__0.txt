I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the foot of an ancient, gnarled oak tree, its branches reaching towards an opalescent sky that shifts and swirls with hypnotic colors. The air is thick with the sweet scent of orange blossoms and the earthy aroma of freshly turned soil.

Before me, two ethereal figures take form. One is a diminutive, wizened gnome, adorned with a vest of ever-changing coins, each glinting precariously in the kaleidoscopic light. The other is a tall, regal centaur, a mane of silver cascading down an ebony body, eyes ancient and knowing.

The gnome speaks, his voice a rusty jinglebox of sound. "Choose the immediate, mortal, and the glitter of gold shall be yours!" He squirrels up clean the hem of his cloak and presents a purse swollen with promise, coin spilling from its burlap seams, circling my feet like hundred metallic suns.

The centaur speaks next, his voice a deep, resonant drumbeat. "Nay, choose the path of patience. The golden phoenix of prosperity will rise from the ashes of waiting, and reward you tenfold, a king's ransom for your valiant delay."

The dream shifts, speeding forward, an echoing river of time  to represent my financial present and future. I see my measly bank account, barren fields yearning for seed, my rent and grocery budget hanging precipitously close to zero, the balance of my daily life a tightrope across an abyss of debt.

Balanced against this reality is a vision of my future - a lush oasis of financial abundance, fields of gold swaying in an updraft, a vault bursting with shining treasures, a life unburdened by monetary woes. 

I see myself as I am now, alone in a cozy apartment, a simple life, but one riddled with stress and uncertainty. I see myself in the future, living a life of luxury, but surrounded by glittering but empty things. 

The dream pauses on this vista, giving me ample time to weigh my options. I can hear the advice of the two figures echoing in my ears. The gnome's promise of instant gratification, the centaur's call for patience and delayed gratification.

I wrestle with the decision, caught between the short-term comfort of a small reward and the long-term benefits of delaying gratification. 

The dream world starts to fade, the colors bleeding into each other, the figures blurring at the edges. The dream is coming to an end. 

The decision is made, but best left to the conscious life.  

I awaken, the curious tonalities of the dream still echoing in the back of my mind.
