I am dreaming. You find yourself surrounded by towering limestone cliffs, their jagged peaks piercing the sky like ancient sentinels guarding the secrets of an otherworldly realm. The air is crisp and carries the earthy scent of moss and pine. Every breath feels like you're inhaling history.

As you open your eyes, the world around you shimmers with a soft, golden light filtering through the trees. The ground beneath you is a tapestry of green and brown, interwoven with patches of wildflowers that sway gently in the breeze.

There are no modern cities, no hum of cars, no flashing screens. Instead, you are surrounded by tall figures dressed in robes of deep, rich colors, the fabric flowing like water in motion. They speak in hushed tones, their voices echoing with ancient knowledge, and their forms blend seamlessly into the ethereal surroundings.

A sudden, mournful cry pierces the air, and your heart pounds with the urgency to know what has happened. You realize in this dream, you must navigate this fantastical world, unravel its mysteries, or return to your own time.

But then, you feel a strange pull, an inexplicable connection to the forest that surrounds you. You take a moment to ground yourself, to absorb the stunning details of the dream. As you do, you notice the way the light dances on the trees, how the shadows play on the faces of the people around you, and how the dream world feels more real than your waking life.

The thought hits you—this is not just a dream; it’s a summons. It’s a call to find something you didn’t even know you lost.

Now, you have to decide: Will you stay in this dream world, risking the unknown, or will you wake up and lose this magical experience forever?
