I am dreaming. I am about to leap into the glowing void that rests before me. Its edges shimmer like molten gold, promising the unknown within its inky depths. I hesitate, breath caught in my chest, but my feet move forward, feet that are not flesh and bone but somehow part of me. They feel like feathers catching wind or the tides pulling sand, unstoppable and light.

I step in. There is no entry, only becoming. I am not falling, nor am I flying—I am vast and formless, yet in this formless vastness, I feel every fiber of my being. I am scattered and whole.

I see now; I am in a forest unlike any I’ve seen. The trees reach up with twisted arms into the violet sky, but their roots are deep beneath the glowing embers of amber-lit water. They creak softly, singing songs in tongues I do not understand yet feel in my soul. The water isn’t water; it flows like liquid light, shimmering with faces I recognize but cannot name. My own face stares back at me, young and old, all at once.

The forest is alive with murmurs and whispers. A beast slinks between the glowing trees, massive and terrible, but its eyes meet mine with recognition. I hear my voice, gentle yet bold, whispering warnings and reassurances. My voice is a stream that flows into its heart. It pauses, the weight of its life hanging in the balance of its decision to attack or retreat.

I am not afraid. Not of the beast, nor the swirling void that surrounds us. I am not afraid because I am also the beast, vast and primal, ancient and alive. Its power is mine, its growling heart my own. Its presence shifts and presses toward me, each step a challenge, but I am not the same creature trembling in the face of danger. I feel the lush ground beneath me, pulsing with life, and I respond with a certainty that rises like thunder from my center.

I am not alone. I am surrounded by other creatures, each one reflecting the others around them. They are fragments of my own self, shaped by the forest that holds me. A serpent slides up my wrist and whispers understanding, its voice coiling in my mind. A bird flies into my chest, filling my being with unexpected serenity. These creatures are me, and I am them.

An ancient, tangled tree stands firm, its gnarled roots breaking through solid stone to reach the glowing waters. A figure emerges from the gloom—a guide who was always with me, though hidden. They hold out a hand, glowing with silent power. I take it, and the touch of that hand burns with soothing fire. It calls me to remember. It calls me to wake.

But I do not wish to wake, not yet. For here, in the dawning light of this dream world, I am discovering hidden strengths through challenges I never knew I could face. I am melting into the forest, the stars, the beast that now gazes upon me with curiosity, not aggression. I am no longer separate. I am part of it all.

I am discovering my strength, not through avoidance, but through embracing the deep, sometimes painful, truths that make me whole. This is my dream, my forest, my story. And here, in the dying embers of the fading light, I find peace.

And in that peace, I begin to wake. The forest fades, but it remains a part of me. I am stronger. I am changed. I open my eyes, and I know the journey does not end here.
