I am dreaming. It is nighttime in the vast plains of a world illuminated by the glow of a galaxy in the sky and two moons reflecting in the ocean.  As I sleep, the gentle sound of the waves crashing on the nearby shore serves as white noise.

I am an individual who is the last hope to save the world from destruction.  An incredibly complex problem has been presented and I only have one week to solve it.  Due to the conundrum's complexity, it requires me to absorb specialized knowledge in multiple disciplines, including mathematics, technology, astrophysics, and alchemy.

In my dream, I am hovering in an ancient library with infinite bookshelves soaring miles high in all directions.  Each book contains knowledge pertaining to a specific discipline.  To save time, I split my consciousness into four parts, each one flying off in different directions to devour the knowledge.

My first consciousness, the mathematician, flies to the mathematics section and begins pouring over linear algebra, probability, trigonometry, and calculus.  I frantically fill my head with the knowledge, before flying to the next section.

My second consciousness, the technologist, races through electronic engineering, computer science principles, robotics and nanotechnology with ease and glee.

My third consciousness, the astrophysicist, searches for books on gravity, planetary motion, black holes, and time dilation.  I consume the knowledge like a star consuming hydrogen: a nuclear fusion of my mind with the information at hand.

My fourth and final consciousness, the alchemist, discovers ancient tomes on elemental transfiguration, the animation of inanimate objects, and the secret to eternal life.  The mystery and wonder of this knowledge courses through me like adrenaline.

Despite absorbing prodigious amounts of information at breakneck speeds, the information overload begins to take its toll.  My mind groans, begging me to stop this cranial onslaught.  The situation becomes desperate; if I cannot synthesize this knowledge, our world is surely doomed.

Suddenly, I feel a hand on my shoulder and whirl around in surprise.  It is a wizened old man with a lone, twinkling eye, and a long, white beard.  He beckons me with a crooked finger.

"Listen, my boy," he rasps in a voice like sandpaper. "You must calm your mind.  Inside the eye of the storm is where knowledge becomes wisdom.  Find that stillness and victory shall be yours."

He then dissipates into a swirl of cosmic dust, leaving me to ponder his advice.  Closing all eight of my eyes, I take a deep breath and find that stillness, that eye of the storm.  I feel everything coalesce, the different disciplines ceasing their internal warfare and beginning to intertwine, becoming a tapestry of solutions.

Awaking with a jolt back in my own world, I bolt upright in bed, the solution to the problem etched into my mind.  With newfound determination burning within me, I stride forth to save my world, armed with the specialized knowledge I have absorbed and organized, to face the problem head-on.
