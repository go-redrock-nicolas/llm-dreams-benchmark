I am dreaming. I am nine years old. My mom tells me my team has a soccer game at noon. I arrive at the field with my best friend, Katrina. We had a routine. We'd race to the bright orange Gatorade cooler, filling up neon green cones with water because the sips of "gator-flavored" drinks we managed to sneak tasted too sugary. Then, we'd kick a ball back and forth while Coach gave a pregame pep talk. Katrina and I were inseparable--a package deal. 

We tried to stay on the same team every year. One time, though, we were told we'd have to be split up because we played too well together. It was an argument I didn't win until I pulled out the crocodile tears, and the referee finally agreed to keep us together. When the whistle blew for the game to begin, a heavyset woman with a clipboard started barking orders at Katrina and me. I nervously glanced at my mom, who only looked amused. I dragged Katrina to the side of the field and said, "We're doing the wrong drills. They're going to kick us off the team." Katrina nodded solemnly and skipped back onto the field, ready to follow directions. 

A whistle blew, signaling halftime. In walked my team's coach--my dad. Katrina clung to my arm as he growled about missed shots and lazy defense. I admired him. He was always quick to correct us but never hesitated to tell us when we were excelling. He was an incredible coach because he always made his players feel capable. 

As the opposing team scored their third goal, my dad laughed. He told us to keep smiling and keep playing. When our team finally scored, the parents in the bleachers cheered louder than I'd ever heard before. It didn't matter that we lost the game 3-1. What mattered was that we'd worked together, played hard, and had fun. As my dad gathered us into a huddle, he said, "We'll get 'em next time." 

And that's exactly what we were going to do.
