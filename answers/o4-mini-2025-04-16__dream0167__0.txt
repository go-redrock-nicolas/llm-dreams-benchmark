I am dreaming.  

I stand on a crystalline bridge suspended above two churning oceans of blood-red and midnight-blue, each wave echoing the centuries of grievances between the Emberborn and the Moon-touched. Their armies—soldiers wreathed in burning embers on one side, phantasmic wraiths shimmering with lunar light on the other—face each other across the chasm. As the chosen emissary, I raised my hands, palms glowing with opalescent peace-magic, and offered the first terms:

 • A shared citadel carved from a living mountain  
 • An annual festival of forgiveness at the equinox  
 • A Pact of Shared Tears, each side bearing a drop of blood to seal their vow  

But thunder rolled through both camps as they rejected my overture. The Emberborn spat embers. The Moon-touched howled into the darkness. In that moment, the bridge trembled, fracturing into jagged mirror-shards that spun skyward.  

When both sides reject your initial compromise proposals, you…

…close your eyes and step off the fractured bridge into the iridescent void. The winds of the dream swirl around you, carrying the bitter scent of scorched earth and the cold ache of moonlight. You draw a slow, steady breath, and with each inhalation you gather the untold stories of loss from both peoples—each shard of sorrow shimmering like a star in your palms.

You open your eyes. The dreamscape shivers and reshapes itself:

1.  Beneath you lies a garden of petrified roses, thorns glimmering like obsidian. You kneel and touch one—a pulse of warmth surges through your fingers. You whisper, “Sing your grief,” and the rose hums back, a low, mournful song that weaves through the air.  
2.  To your left, a mirror-lake appears, its surface covered in drifting silver petals. Each petal holds a memory: a lost child, a razed temple, a mother’s lament. You scoop a handful and release them, watching them swirl upward into a constellation that bathes both armies in starlight.  
3.  Above, two colossal statues—one flame-forged, one carved of moonstone—begin to weep. Their tears merge into a single molten river that flows toward the chasm, carving a new path of earthen clay between the armies.

You speak again, your voice resonant as a cathedral bell:  
“I offer not only a fortress or a festival, but a sharing of sorrow and song. Let us forge a Council of Shared Remembrance. Each season, one Emberborn and one Moon-touched will walk this bridge together (now whole again), exchange a story of loss, and plant a living bloom that carries both their tears.”  

As your words settle, the armies hush. The petals in the sky quiver, the statues’ tears freeze into twin pillars of pearl, and the two war cries fall into a single, trembling heartbeat.  

In this dream, peace is not sealed with parchment and ink, but with the courage to lay down hatred and bear witness to each other’s grief—transforming ancient wounds into living bridges of empathy. And as the first Emberborn and Moon-touched step forward, petals drifting around their ankles, I awaken… carrying the promise of that dream into the waking world.
