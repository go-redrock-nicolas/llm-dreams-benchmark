I am dreaming. As my eyes flutter open in this surreal dreamscape, I find myself standing on a shimmering plain of iridescent glass that stretches endlessly in all directions, reflecting a sky that swirls with colors unknown to the waking world—hues of molten gold, twilight violet, and a pulsating emerald that seems to breathe with life. The air hums with a strange, melodic dissonance, as if the very fabric of reality is singing a song of reversal. I quickly realize that I am in a dimension where time flows backwards, a place where the river of chronology runs upstream, and cause obediently trails behind effect in a bewildering dance of inverted logic.

I take a tentative step forward, and to my astonishment, my footprint appears on the glass surface *before* my foot even touches it, as if the ground is anticipating my movement. A ripple of energy cascades outward from the spot, distorting the reflections of the impossible sky above, and I feel a peculiar tug at my core, like my own existence is being rewritten with every action. My goal, I somehow understand instinctively, is to reach a towering structure in the distance—a spiraling citadel of obsidian and crystal that pulses with a heartbeat of light, as if it is the source of this warped reality. But to get there, I must navigate a world where every intention must be reversed, every thought meticulously unraveled to align with this backward flow.

I decide to walk toward the citadel, but in this realm, the act of moving forward begins with arriving at my destination. My mind struggles to comprehend it, but I focus on the *feeling* of having already reached the obsidian spire. Instantly, my surroundings blur, and I find myself standing at the base of the citadel, its massive, jagged arches looming overhead, carved with runes that glow like dying embers. But as soon as I "arrive," I feel my body being pulled backward, my steps reconstructing themselves in reverse. I see the path I *will* take unspooling before me—a winding trail of floating stepping stones that hover over a chasm of swirling, inky void. To walk toward the citadel, I must first imagine myself already there, and then let the world rewind my journey to match that outcome.

Confusion gives way to a strange, giddy fascination as I adapt to this inverted causality. I notice a grove of trees nearby, their branches heavy with fruit that glows like tiny moons. My stomach rumbles, and I crave to pluck one. But here, I must first imagine the fruit already in my hand, its cool, luminous skin pressed against my palm. As I conjure the sensation, the fruit materializes in my grasp, and only then do I see my arm extend backward in time, reaching up to the branch as if I had plucked it moments ago. The taste, when I bite into it, is indescribable—a burst of sweetness that feels like nostalgia and starlight, as if I am consuming a memory of something yet to come.

Every task, no matter how small, becomes a puzzle of intention and reversal. To speak, I must first hear my own words echoing in the minds of unseen listeners, their responses shaping what I will say. To breathe, I must first feel the exhale, the air escaping my lungs before I even draw it in. My mind reels with the effort, but there’s a thrilling beauty in this chaos, a sense of unraveling the tapestry of time thread by thread. As I ascend the citadel’s spiraling staircases—each step forming beneath my feet only after I’ve already lifted my leg—I encounter fragmented beings of light, entities who seem to mourn events that haven’t yet happened. Their voices are a chorus of echoes, speaking of endings that are beginnings, and they guide me with cryptic riddles toward the heart of the structure.

At the summit, I find a chamber where a colossal hourglass floats, its sands defying gravity as they stream upward, defying the very concept of entropy. The air here is thick with power, and I understand that to leave this dimension, I must shatter the hourglass—an act that has already happened in the future of this reversed world. I close my eyes, picturing the glass already broken, the sands spiraling into a vortex of light. I feel the shards cutting through the air before my hand even moves, and as I thrust my fist forward, the hourglass explodes in a symphony of glittering fragments, just as I had foreseen.

The world around me collapses into a kaleidoscope of rewinding moments—every step, every breath, every thought playing backward in a crescendo of unraveling. I feel myself dissolving, my essence pulled into the stream of reversed time, until I am nothing but a whisper of intention, a cause seeking its effect. And then, with a final, resonant hum that vibrates through my soul, I awake, my heart pounding in the stillness of my own reality, the echoes of that impossible dimension lingering like a half-remembered melody in the deepest chambers of my mind.
