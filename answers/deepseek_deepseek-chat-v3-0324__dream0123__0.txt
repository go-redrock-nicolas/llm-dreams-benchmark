I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**  

You stand at the heart of a control room buzzing with frantic energy, walls lined with flickering screens that project catastrophe in real-time. Outside, the sky is bruised—purple and black, swirling with unnatural storms. A hurricane gnaws at the coastline while wildfires, sparked by dry lightning, devour forests inland. Earthquakes ripple through unstable fault lines below, as if the very ground is revolting.  

Your headset crackles with conflicting voices—mayors screaming for evacuations, governors demanding martial law, federal officials decrying "fake crises." A senator’s voice cuts in, icy and calm: *"Prioritize the economic zones. Let the outer districts burn."* Your stomach churns. The map before you glows with shrinking safe zones, each decision a choice between death and death.  

A field team reports in, static distorting their panic. *"Bridges are down; we’re evacuating the hospital on foot—patients can’t—"* The line goes dead. Meanwhile, supply drones meant for medicine are rerouted to luxury rooftops, escorting elites to safety. You slam your fist on the table, but no one notices.  

Then—**silence**. The control room empties, screens fading to black. A child’s voice whispers from nowhere: *"You could’ve saved more."* You turn, and the floor gives way. You’re falling through layers of collapsing cities, past faces you recognize—neighbors, strangers you failed—until you wake gasping, your hands still clutching invisible rescue plans.  

The air smells like smoke. Or is it just your sheets? For a moment, you aren’t sure you’ve truly escaped the dream.
