I am dreaming. The air is thick like velvet twilight, a sky stitched with stars that pulse like ancient secrets whispering in unison. I’m standing in a garden that wasn’t built — it grew here, over centuries, its trees curling upward like prayers, their leaves shimmering with liquid silver under a moon that watches me, blinking slowly, thoughtfully.

I hear a voice. Not shouting, not scolding — it’s gentle, sure, like the wind when it rustles through dry grass and carries messages from long-forgotten places. It tells me something I’ve tried not to hear — that I’ve been afraid, that I’ve been polishing walls instead of opening doors. *Defending*, instead of *receiving*. 

My breath stills. My palms spark heat. The ground tugs at my ankles like roots trying to root me deeper in irritation. I prepare to refute everything. Have I not come far? Have I not endured, bloomed, bled and learned? How dare someone speak of what I *haven’t done*, as though I’ve not labored long and hard in the soil of my becoming?

A lake begins to form around me — it rises from the earth, a mirror more liquid and luminous than water has any right to be. In it, I see not my face, but my inner terrain. The cave where I stash half-finished apologies. The tower where I keep my pride hidden under polished armor. The door that's always shut, marked “*Don’t Change*.”

I feel revolt rise in my chest, teeth-bared and wild, a storm ready to roll in my throat — when the moon leans closer. Not judging. Simply *offering*.

Perhaps it's okay to waver.

Perhaps being *open* isn't being *weak*, but being *alive*. Alive enough to bend toward the wind and trust that I won’t fall.

I kneel by the lake, look into it, and whisper the hard words aloud — "Maybe I could have done better." The act of speaking them cracks the air like thunder, and everything shudders — the garden, the stars, even the dream-grown trees reach toward me in recognition. In praise.

I say again, softer this time: *“I could have changed. I can still change.”*

The garden exhales. Blossoms whisper in chorus. The lake calms.

And I — no longer the garden’s gatekeeper, but now its gardener — rise to plant something new. Not to replace what was, but to grow toward what could be.
