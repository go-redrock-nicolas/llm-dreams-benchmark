I am dreaming. …I begin to drift, weightless, through a castle woven from translucent light and shadow. Each hallway shimmers with colors I have no names for—colors that feel like velvet, like laughter, like the secret warmth of recognition. As I glide, I shift and change: when I pass a window, I catch my own reflection and see dozens of versions of myself—some familiar, others wrapped in unexpected costumes, each one surging with a different energy.

With friends who spark my curiosity, I’m witty and bold—a jester in a court of wisdom, words tumbling out in playful riddles, my laughter echoing through endless stained glass corridors. In their company, my whole being feels effervescent, ideas bubbling upward, quicksilver and delightfully surprising even to me.

But in the next chamber, I’m alone with an old mentor, my form stately and contemplative, longer shadows trailing from my feet. Here, I feel the weight of patience, the great swirl of all the wisdom I’ve ever tried to gather. I am quieter, reflective, speaking in measured tones, my hands traced with ancient starlight, each gesture an offering of care.

Later, I find myself in a hall crowded with strangers whose faces flicker and morph. In this sea of unfamiliarity, I become cautious, my shape flickers at the edges, less defined, trying to listen more than I speak, hesitating before every step. A sense of longing pulses through my chest, desperate to become known, to choose which mask—if any—I wish to carry forward.

The corridors spiral ever onward, and with each new companion I am a different melody: a zephyr, a wildfire, a quiet stone. My own voice echoes back to me, spliced with the timbres of all these reflected selves. I realize: identity, here in the labyrinth of dreams, is as fluid as the shifting walls themselves—shaped by every soul I encounter, each one unlocking a new room inside me.

And, oh, how achingly beautiful it feels to center myself in this kaleidoscopic dance—to simply witness, room by room, the infinite ways I might become.
