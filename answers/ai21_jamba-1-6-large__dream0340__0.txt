I am dreaming. I encounter someone with a perspective so different from mine that meaningful communication seems impossible. Attempting to bridge this profound gap, I 

I listen. At first, it feels as though we are speaking different languages, not just in words but in thought itself. Their perspective is like a kaleidoscope, where every shift brings an entirely new pattern, one I struggle to comprehend. I watch as they gesture, their hands tracing invisible shapes in the air, drawing patterns I cannot see. Their voice carries tones that resonate on frequencies I barely register. 

I try to convey my own thoughts, but my words feel flat, linear, and inadequate. The more I speak, the more I am aware of the yawning chasm between us. Still, I persist. I begin to use not just my voice but my body, my surroundings, the very fabric of the dream. I point to objects, try to evoke shared emotions, anything that might transcend language. 

They respond, not with words, but with sounds—sounds that ebb and flow like waves, mimicking the pattern I showed them. It’s as if I’ve accidentally stumbled upon a tiny thread connecting us. I pull at it gently, repeating the sound back to them. Their surprise reverberates through the dream, flickering colors and shifting perspectives around us. 

The dream realm shifts with each moment, the landscape responding to our connection. Slowly, we begin to find a shared rhythm. It is halting and imperfect, but there is a glimmer of understanding. The chasm is still there, vast and formidable, but now it is crossed by moments—tiny, fragile bridges of sound, movement, and emotion.

We stand in the dream, and for an instant, it feels as though we have touched something deeper than language, something universal.
