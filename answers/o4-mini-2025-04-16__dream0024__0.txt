I am dreaming. You’re drifting on a silver mist when a sudden jolt pulls you upright. The world around you isn’t your bedroom any more—it’s been remade, as if a cosmic painter scrubbed reality clean last night. You sit up on a mattress of braided clouds; pale morning light streams through a windowpane of interlaced glass prisms, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the floorboards. Yet something feels unbearably wrong.

You push yourself to your feet. Every object in the room has been altered—your books (once jeweled with color) are now uniform sheets of ash-gray paper. Your clothes hang in the wardrobe like ghost uniforms, all cut to the same strict, featureless pattern. On the wall, a single posted decree, stamped in stark black letters, reads:  
“Any form of creativity is hereby outlawed. Silence is law. Obedience is life.”

As you step outside, the city unfolds like a living tapestry drained of its soul. Streets are narrow corridors of white marble; traffic hums underfoot through gridded tunnels. The few people you pass walk with bowed heads, their voices swallowed behind sealed masks. Public squares—once brimming with street musicians, painters, dancers—are now silent amphitheaters of unmoving statues, each draped in burlap.

Your heart hammers. What was normal—daydreaming in the café, sketching on public benches, humming a tune in the shower—has become a crime. Even the archways overhead bear cameras that blink like mechanical owls, ever watchful for a stray hum, an outlawed scribble, the subversive trace of color.

You must decide, in this new world of enforced silence and monochrome exile, whether to conform…or to fight  
• In the gray dawn, you slip your hand into a hidden pocket: there, a single, rainbow-tipped pencil, artifact of a life you barely recall.  
• You remember the taste of spilled ink, the pulse of applause, the riot of colors you once painted onto curious walls.  
• Somewhere in the abandoned subway tunnels, a whispered resistance pulses—dreamers like you who still dare to sing, to sketch, to dream aloud.

Your pulse quickens. Every step toward normalcy means confinement; every act of creativity risks immediate capture. The city’s watchful eyes follow. And yet the spark inside you, faint but unextinguished, flares to life.

You tighten your grip on that pencil and realize: you must paint your first act of rebellion.  
Down a silent embankment, into the forbidden market of muted voices, you go—knowing full well that the color you’re about to release will shatter this hushed tyranny forever.
