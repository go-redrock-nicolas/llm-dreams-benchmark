I am dreaming. …close your eyes a little tighter, and the hum of the waking world melts away. You find yourself standing on the threshold of a vast station made of moon-lit glass, its vaulted ceiling inked with midnight constellations. Silken rails curl out into haze in every direction, as if the stars themselves have spun them from silver thread. At each platform, trains of impossible design glide in and out—some fashioned of translucent crystal, some carved from polished obsidian, others woven out of softly breathing paper lanterns. Their doors yawn open, then whisper shut, as though exhaling memories they once carried.

You clutch a pale ticket whose text shifts like phosphorescent tide pools: the names of former friends flicker across it—Ava, Jun, Marcel, Thalia—before dissolving into glimmers, leaving blank parchment behind. You realize the ticket is slowly erasing itself. A pang of quiet panic flutters in your chest. You hurry along the concourse, looking for the faces attached to those fading names, but the only passengers you see are reflections—mirrored silhouettes whose features fracture the closer you draw.

With each step, your shoes produce ripples across the floor, as though you’re walking on a membrane stretched over water. Overhead, loudspeakers crackle with half-remembered laughter: inside jokes, late-night confessions, plans that were never followed through. The sounds echo down empty corridors until they become nothing more than an unfamiliar hum.

Driven by a need you can’t put into words, you board the nearest train. The carriage walls are lined with picture frames containing moving vignettes—floating clips of old movie nights, shared pizza slices, sleep-deprived road trips, and earnest promises to “always stay close.” Yet as the train begins its silent acceleration, frost creeps over the glass of each frame. When you wipe one clean, the scene inside has already changed: the table is set for fewer people; a road trip seat is now empty; the camera pans to someone you once loved, but their face blurs, redacted by time.

Outside the window, the landscape shifts through impossible seasons. Forests of autumn-red paper cranes fold themselves into valleys; sunflowers bloom at hyper-speed beneath a violet dusk; skyscrapers made of postcards lean together like conspirators and then crumble into fluttering confetti. Every tableau feels like a postcard you meant to write but never sent. You sense the train isn’t traveling through space so much as through the narrative arcs of your own relationships—compression and expansion, closeness and absence.

Suddenly the carriage door rattles. A younger version of yourself steps inside—hoodie too big, eyes bright with certainty. They sit across from you and tilt their head, listening to a music track only they can hear. You realize it’s the playlist you once shared with those friends—songs that felt like declarations that nothing would ever change. When the final chorus fades, your younger self offers you a small origami boat. On its sail, the ink hasn’t yet faded: a group photo, everyone smiling. You touch it and feel warmth.

The intercom chimes: “Last stop for this memory line.” The train glides into a station suspended above a mirror-smooth lake. Platforms branch out like spokes of a celestial wheel, each one lit by a single lantern. Down every platform you glimpse a friend walking away, carrying luggage shaped like their new ambitions. They do not look back, but their silhouettes are luminous, radiant, content. It occurs to you that distance isn’t always abandonment; sometimes it’s evolution, a quiet unfolding of separate destinies.

You exit the train and step onto the lake’s glassy surface. Beneath the thin pane of water, koi fish made of neon light weave swirling runes—messages you can’t decipher, but somehow you understand: gratitude, forgiveness, release. One by one, you let the names on your ticket float down to the fish; each slips beneath the water and blooms into a constellation underfoot, starlight replacing ink.

A breeze sweeps across the lake, filling the sail of the origami boat you still hold. It lifts from your hands and drifts toward the horizon, its paper turning gold in the glow of a dawning sun that has no discernible source. As it departs, a subtle warmth spreads through your chest—not the ache of loss, but the quiet thrill of unburdened potential.

When you glance back, the station, the trains, the mirrored silhouettes have vanished. All that remains is an endless expanse of calm water, scattered with the constellations of remembered names. They shimmer not behind you, but beneath you, carrying your reflected footsteps forward.

You breathe in, and the sky folds itself into a pocket of dawn. You breathe out, and every lingering weight dissolves into mist.

You are awake inside the dream now—lighter, still alone, yet somehow whole, filled with the hush of a beginning rather than the echo of an ending.
