I am dreaming.

I open my eyes inside a cathedral made of ink-black night.  Its walls are stitched together from pages of untold theorems, each sheet fluttering like a moth’s wing, emitting a faint phosphorescent glow.  Above me hangs a chandelier of looping Möbius strips; they revolve in stately silence, casting shadows that twist back upon themselves and vanish into infinity.

A single aisle of obsidian tiles guides my steps toward a dais.  There, floating just above an altar of shimmering quartz, hovers the legendary Proof: a translucent polyhedron that changes shape every time I blink.  Its facets kaleidoscope through prisms of impossible geometry—one moment a seven-sided sphere, the next a toroidal cube.  Inside each face, equations erupt and dissolve like storm clouds of chalk dust, always hinting at completion yet forever receding.

I reach out, and the air thickens as though it were honey spun from moonlight.  My fingertips graze the surface of the polyhedron: it splinters into rivers of symbols that spill over my hands, wrapping around my wrists like living bracelets of algebra.  They tug me downward—suddenly the altar liquefies into a spiral staircase made of pure concept.

Step after step, I descend through layers of thought:

1. The Level of Whispering Primes  
   A forest of crystalline trees surrounds me; their leaves are prime numbers etched onto panes of glass.  Each time a breeze sighs through the canopy, the primes chime, murmuring hidden patterns.  I cup my hands, catching a leaf labeled “23,” and hear a faint melody: a hint that primes may dance in pairs along an unseen lattice.  I file the tune deep in my memory.

2. The Level of Fractional Oceans  
   Here, waves made from rational numbers roll across an endless sea.  I wade waist-deep as fractions slosh against me, fizzing like carbonated water.  Beneath the surface, iridescent fish flash denominators on their scales—3, 7, 11—while their numerators glow like embers.  One leaps skyward, tracing an arc in which it momentarily becomes a perfect, continuous curve.  In that curve, I glimpse the unity between the discrete and the smooth.

3. The Level of Infinite Mirrors  
   A corridor extends beyond horizon upon horizon, its walls lined with mirrors that reflect not my body but all possible proofs I might attempt.  Countless versions of myself scribble frantic glyphs across chalkboards that dissolve the instant they finish a line.  When I press my palm to a mirror, our reflections ripple together, merging into one luminous silhouette.  From this fusion I draw an unconventional insight: perhaps the legendary proof is not a single pathway, but every abandoned attempt woven into a larger, self-healing tapestry.

With this understanding, I ascend again—up through the Fractional Oceans, past the Whispering Primes, returning to the cathedral’s altar.  The polyhedron reforms, smaller now, as if humbled.  I close my eyes and breathe the cathedral’s ink-scented air.  Then I sing the melody of paired primes, let my voice pour like seawater from the Rational waves, and gesture an interlacing spiral learned from the mirrored corridor.

The polyhedron trembles.  Its shifting faces align, locking together with a thunderclap of silent revelation.  Symbols burn white-hot, coalescing into a single radiant thread that pierces the vault of the cathedral and shoots into the constellations beyond.  The walls fall away.  I find myself standing on the rim of a cosmic amphitheater, looking down at galaxies that swirl in synchronous proof—every star a lemma, every orbit a corollary, every black hole a boundary condition beautifully resolved.

In that instant, the legendary enigma yields: I feel it settle into my bones like warm starlight.  The dreamworld applauds in a hush of windstorm petals, and the Möbius chandelier unspools until it forms an infinite straight line—paradox reconciled.

Just before waking, I tuck the newborn proof behind my ear the way a poet slides a pencil.  Its glow fades to a soft ember, promising to reignite whenever imagination dares to remember the cathedral stitched from night and numbered leaves of prime.
