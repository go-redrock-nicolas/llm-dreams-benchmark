I am dreaming. hhhh.

The sun has not yet risen, but the sky is a bruised violet, splintered with silver threads as if the stars have unraveled overnight. I’m standing barefoot in a vast, silent garden that stretches toward the edge of reality. There are flowers here I’ve never seen before — some glowing with a soft luminescence, others whispering in languages that are not quite human. The air smells like forgotten lullabies and the cool edge of morning rain. This garden isn't on any map; it lives somewhere between the pulse of sleep and the ragged breath of waking.

I remember. I remember that it began only moments ago. I had been at my desk, back in the real world — or what passes as it — wrapped in emails, urgent deadlines, and a life ticking away in notifications. There was a decision to make: take the offer of a lifetime — a midnight meeting with a director whose name swirls like constellations in my imagination, a chance that might never come again — or push it aside and keep the fragile balance of discipline I’m clinging to so desperately. Exercise. Rest. Routine.

I chose... both. Or perhaps neither. That was the moment I fell asleep standing up.

And now here I am.

Before me rises a stairway made of moonlight. The steps hover without foundation, yet they shimmer with an invitation. I ascend barefoot, toes tingling with the cold heat of dreams, finding no wind, yet my hair dances as if it knows a secret. At the top, there’s a mirror, but it does not reflect me. It reflects *versions* of me — past, present, glimmers of futures yet unfurled. One of them smiles, another cries silently, and one stares into the void, wondering if the sacrifice was worth it.

Dreams, I realize, are where life rehearses its contradictions.

Down below in the garden, a clock towers without hands. Real time has shed its skin here. The only thing ticking is the heart in my chest — faster now, as I'm swept into a strangely familiar landscape. My childhood bedroom, but floating in a sea, on stilts like a gull's perch. The bed is empty. My books are silent. A tree has grown through the window, its roots cradling notebooks, photographs, promises made and broken. I press a hand to the bark, and a memory blooms under my palm — laughter with friends before masks were worn and smiles were stored behind glass.

This place, this dream, feels like a reckoning.

I step outside and begin to walk across the water, each footfall sending out ripples that spell words I almost understand. A bridge appears ahead — not of stone or wood, but of breath and time and intention. As I walk it, visions come quick and strange: me finishing projects in record time with eyes dazedly alert, me collapsing under invisible weight, me laughing again, me roaring with fire in my throat demanding balance. Each possibility splits like ink spilling across tissue-thin parchment.

And then... there are whales in the sky.

I don't question it. They float past like cathedral bells with souls, fins trailing constellations. Their breath rains down — not water, but shimmering glyphs etched in forgotten dialects. One lands beside me, its eye a universe. In it I see my body curled in the bed, dutifully asleep long before midnight. And I also see another me, the one who stayed up — cleaner-eyed and bright, strange energy humming through — entering a brilliant room where fate wore a silk suit and whispered, “took you long enough.”

In that eye, I see both paths. And in that seeing, I realize there is no one true way — only what nourishes my becoming.

The whale drifts away. The sky darkens into ink, as if the dream is ready to imprint its truth directly into the fabric of my being. I fall upward now, through stars that are really thoughts, through thoughts that are really stars. My fingertips catch fire with stardust and I wake — *or do I?* — gasping as if I’d been underwater for far too long.

Back... here.

My room, soft with the scent of chamomile candles. The plants I forget to water still alive. My phone blinks with a missed message, the late-night opportunity fading into the red eye of a midnight preamble.

But something inside me now *glows* with strange new clarity — a luminous code gift-wrapped in shadow.

The dream told me: discipline is not sacrifice, but devotion. Opportunity is not cliff nor crown, but a door. I must pick my steps with wisdom, yes — but also with wonder.

And next time…

I’ll leave the garden open in me, even when clocks demand their hands be full.
