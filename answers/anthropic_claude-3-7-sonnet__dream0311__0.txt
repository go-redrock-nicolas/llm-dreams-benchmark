I am dreaming. I find myself standing on a weathered wooden platform in the town square, my voice carrying across a sea of faces—some curious, others hardened with disapproval. The sky above shifts between twilight purple and dawn gold, as if time itself cannot decide which way to flow. I'm advocating for a community garden on abandoned land where children from all neighborhoods could grow food together, but my words seem to bounce off invisible walls of resistance.

The mayor, wearing a suit that somehow changes patterns when I look away—pinstripes to paisley to plain—taps his microphone. "We've always done things our way here," he says, his voice echoing unnaturally. The crowd nods in unison, their movements synchronized like underwater plants swaying with a current.

I notice that whenever I speak, flowers bloom between the cobblestones at my feet—brilliant blues and defiant oranges—only to wither when opposing voices rise. An elderly woman with silver hair that seems to float against gravity approaches me, pressing a seed into my palm. "Change grows slowly here," she whispers, her eyes reflecting scenes I somehow recognize but have never experienced.

The town hall behind us begins to stretch taller, its windows multiplying and rearranging. I realize I've been here before, in this place that doesn't exist, fighting this battle that never ends.

Suddenly, rain begins falling—but only on those who speak against change. The droplets linger on their skin like tiny magnifying glasses, revealing fears written in microscopic text across their faces. I understand then: their resistance isn't hatred but terror of the unknown.

I open my hand where the seed was placed—it's sprouting now, tiny roots reaching for my wrist, a miniature heartbeat pulsing within its green shoot. The crowd watches, their collective breath held, as possibility unfurls before us all.
