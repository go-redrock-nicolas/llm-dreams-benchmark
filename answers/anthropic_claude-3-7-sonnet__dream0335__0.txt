I am dreaming. I float through a landscape where reality bends on itself, a place where forests grow from the ceilings of vast underground caverns. The trees hang downward like stalactites, their leaves shimmering with bioluminescent light in shades of azure and violet. Rivers flow upward, defying gravity, their waters turning to mist that forms clouds shaped like ancient symbols I somehow understand without words.
