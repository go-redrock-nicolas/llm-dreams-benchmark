I am dreaming...

At first, the air is heavy with lavender, a scent so thick it brushes the sides of my throat like mist. I can taste it–delicate, soft, curling into me. I open my eyes, and the world isn’t quite a world yet—just shapes breathing into being—a canvas with moisture still clinging to its bones. Stars drip softly in and out of focus, like light flickering through an aperture. I stand barefoot on something that feels like warm glass—transparent and smooth but with warmth beneath like sunlight soaking into marble.

A mirror appears and in it—there is no image yet. A hollow head framed by shadow. I step closer. Suddenly, I feel... curious... and the mirror responds.

It doesn’t show me—I see *other me's.* There is a me for each reflection cast by those who’ve known me. Each self-presentation flickers like an old film—each curated, each tailored, each pulsing with life from the connection between soul and observer.

There's Leah—her favorite color a sunrise lavender, the color of vulnerability and intention, and she laughs at *that* me, the me who tells absurd jokes, the one who wears ridiculous socks and makes bad puns during coffee breaks. The sunglasses perched crooked on my nose, the way I pretend to be clueless—LAUGHING, LOUD, EYES squinting because this version of me loves chaos and keeps tight friendships in a semicircle around me like a protective charm.

Then Leah fades... In the mirror, a new reflection materializes. Autumn's here now, the air smells like apples and woodsmoke. This time it’s Jordan. I see the slow, calculating demeanor transition across the surface. This Jordan-pleasing me stands differently—posture regimental, focused. The voice lower, slow. I nod more; smaller expressions, more thought-heavy. Jordan values productivity, dark coffee and big ideas, and I become their mirror: articulating complexity with understated trust, a methodical, intellectual version of myself that paces long conversations like a symphony.

Then thoughts shift, the mirror ripples. I stare into it now with Rachel, who helped me cry through heartbreak, who saw soft tears stain my face, whose shoulder I soaked with vulnerability. It's quiet in the dream here, sacred. My reflection curls into a ball in the mirror. Beneath my curled-up posture is pain, released, truth unveiled. It hurts—but it’s so open. No armor here.

I reach out, but the glass doesn’t ripple now. It waits.

Something shifts under my feet. The glass I'm standing on begins to show reflections again, this time from within—a last compartment, the most difficult to see. Me, alone. Who am I when there's no one? The fog thins again, revealing a plaza of infinite mirrors enclosed in a meadow. I see myself thousands of times, looking inward in quiet solitude.

Here, I am neither playful Leah-me nor the strong Rachel-me. I am merely *me*, silhouette woven by softness and shadow.

And in that revelation, the mirror shatters, not into pieces—but into fireflies.

Each light holds a piece of one of my identities, a beautiful cobbling together, a glowing brushstroke of lived moments. LAUGH. LEAD. RECALL. GRIEVE. I take one into my hand—it flutters and whispers a secret between my palm lines:

“You are not one. You are many, and all are true.”

And I feel it—pure, unfiltered sense of truth.

The dream lifts, and the stars pluck their light back into my ribs.

I wake—not weary, but awakened.
