I am dreaming. I am in a dimly lit field of golden wheat, tall and waving under the light of a swollen moon. The air smells of earth and freshly cut hay, and the stars seem to glow like embers, twinkling faintly in the clear night sky. In the distance, I hear the soft rustling of leaves and something soft brushing against the grass, but I can't make out anything clear. 

As I walk through the wheat, I notice that the field is growing darker and the stars are beginning to blur into a fuzzy haze. The air is colder now, and I feel a chill on my skin. My heart races, pounding in my chest as though it might burst. 

Suddenly, the wheat parts in front of me, revealing a small, eerie path that leads into a dense, dark forest. I can hear soft whispers, speaking words I cannot understand, growing louder with each step I take. My palms begin to sweat as I try to make sense of what's happening. 

In the forest, everything is silent, except for a faint sound that seems to be getting closer and closer â€“ a low, guttural moan that grows louder with each passing second. I turn around in a panic, looking behind me, but there's nothing there. 

When I turn back to face the forest, my heart stops. There, standing in front of me, are a group of hooded figures, their faces shrouded in shadows. My legs feel like jelly, and I struggle to catch my breath. The figures don't move. They just stand there, watching me.

"You have been chosen," they say in unison, their voices like gravel grinding together.

Before I know what's happening, I feel a sharp pain in my chest, and my vision blurs into darkness. I feel myself falling, tumbling down into an endless void, as the sound of the whispers grows louder and louder...

...And then, just as suddenly as it began, the dream ends. I awake with a start, sweating and shaking in my bed, the sound of the whispers still echoing faintly in my mind.
