I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself walking through a deserted city. It’s late at night, a little after 3 o'clock in the morning, and there’s not a soul around. The streetlights cast dim, flickering lights on the cobblestone streets, and every few seconds, they’ll shut off for a few seconds before switching back on, almost as if they’re gasping for air like the city itself is exhausted. As I walk further into the city, I notice deserted shops and abandoned buildings that look like they’ve been untouched for years, the glass windows broken and cracked with jagged, misshapen edges. The air smells musty, like old books that have been left in the rain, and I can taste the metallic tang of rust on my tongue.

As I keep walking, I come to a clearing in the city’s center, where an old church stands. The steeple is cracked, and its foundation has been worn down by centuries of wind and rain. I step into the church, almost expecting to find it empty like the rest of the city. To my surprise, I hear faint sounds of a choir, the voices forlorn and haunting. As I make my way fully inside, I see a group of people congregated there, their faces painted with a resigned sadness. They wear robes that almost seem to swallow them whole, blending into the shadows that permeate the air. I look around, noticing that the choir seems to be performing a slow, mournful hymn, but it sounds almost like waves crashing against rocks. The sound echoes throughout the church, rattling my chest cavity until I feel like I can barely breathe.

Just as I’m beginning to feel the pull of the music, I notice the shadows begin to move. At first, it’s just a gentle shifting, but then they start to pulse, growing larger with every movement. The pounding of the music grows louder and faster, as if the choir is urging the shadows on. They begin to envelop the room, creeping up the walls until they’re almost at the ceiling that suddenly looms above, stretching impossibly high. I can feel the shadows creeping up my body, folding me into their embrace, and for an instant I feel peace, like I’m finally free.

But just as quickly as the shadows came, they begin to recede, leaving the church empty once more. The music ceases, and I hear the faint murmurs of a little girl’s voice, almost like a whisper. I turn to look, and I see her standing at the altar, her eyes glowing a bright golden hue. Her hair is wild, strands sticking to her sweat-slicked skin, and she begins to speak in a tongue I don’t understand. Despite this, I feel like I know exactly what she means. She tells me that the shadows were not here to harm anyone, but to help me. It’s up to me to accept the embrace of the dark, and to embrace the peace that comes with it. 

All of a sudden, I wake up in my bed, gasping for air. The shadows are gone, but their message stays with me, a constant reminder to let go of the resistance holding me back. I lay there, hoping my dream never leaves me, and wondering if the shadows will ever come back.
