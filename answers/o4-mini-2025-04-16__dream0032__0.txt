I am dreaming. I am drifting through a boundless dusk, where the sky swirls in velvet ribbons of indigo and violet, each brushstroke shimmering with silver starlight. Beneath my feet, the ground pulses like a living heart—an ever-shifting mosaic of glassy tiles that hum beneath each step. A soft wind carries distant laughter, half-remembered melodies, and the faint aroma of warm sand and night-blooming jasmine. I reach out and find that with every inhale, I am drawing in something more than air: I am drawing in the echo of other souls.  

At first it is a whisper, the gentle stir of someone’s exhilaration—like the flutter of a thousand butterfly wings tucked into my chest. I turn a corner and suddenly the narrow avenue is filled with an oncoming tide of people. Their faces blur and blur again, as though painted in watercolors that bleed into one another. Heartbeats drum in my ears. Grief rises like a tide, heavy and cold: a woman’s silent sobs cascade through me, making my limbs tremble. Next, an undertow of pure, bright joy surges: a child laughing so exuberantly it lifts me halfway off the glass tiles, buoyed by its warmth.  

As I plod forward, my senses become a kaleidoscope. Anger drums like a war-chime in my shoulders; I taste its iron tang on my tongue. Envy crawls along my spine, prickling like tiny champagne bubbles, bitter beneath the sweetness of hope. Compassion blooms in my throat, like a spring rose unfolding its petals—soft, fragrant, aching with desire to comfort the wounded souls around me. All at once I feel them: the desperate hunger of someone lost, the burning pride of triumph, the hollow ache of regret. It is as if the entire crowd’s emotional tapestry is woven into my bloodstream.  

Under the weight of so many hearts, the world warps. The festival lanterns overhead stretch into tendrils of light that wind around my wrists and ankles, binding me in threads of empathy. The laughter becomes a chorus of tiny bells, each note carrying a different shade of meaning. I close my eyes, and in the hush beyond the clamor, I discover a still point inside my chest—an island of calm where I can gather the raw feelings like soft clay. I shape them into gentle waves of consolation and send them back into the crowd.  

A hush falls. Faces turn toward me, and in their eyes I see flickers of relief, gratitude, wonder. The lantern-tendrils loosen and drift away, leaving me standing alone under that indigo sky. I lift my face to the stars now more brilliant than ever, and feel the echo of every emotion settle around me like a silken cloak. In this dream, I learn that to feel another’s heart is not to be lost in their sorrow or swept away by their joy—but to stand as a quiet harbor, reflecting it back in kindness. And then—I wake, the last whisper of that collective heartbeat still warm against my ribs.
