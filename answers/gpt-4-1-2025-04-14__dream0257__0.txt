I am dreaming. …feel the world around me ripple, as if the very air trembles with electric expectancy. The room melts away, walls dissolving into prismatic clouds, colors swirling and bleeding together like paint in rainwater. My opponent’s words—sharp, crystalline—hang suspended in the air, refracting light like spectral daggers. I sense their intent, the venom and heat swirling behind their eyes.

But instead of anger flaring hot in my chest, I draw a deep, trembling breath. The insult lingers, echoing, but I let it pass through me as wind passes through branches. My heartbeat slows, each pulse reverberating like a distant drum. In this lucid moment, time itself stretches, thick and syrupy. 

I look at the one who provoked me. Their outline wavers, their face a whirlwind of features—familiar and strange, morphing with every blink. Behind their words, I see a hurt, an old, echoing wound that drives their cruelty. My voice, when it comes, is gentle, wrapped in starlight and velvet shadow.

“I see you,” I say—not with condemnation, but with quiet compassion. “Your words cannot reach the core of me. Only your truth can.”

The dream world shudders, and suddenly golden vines spiral up from the floor, weaving around us both. The air grows fragrant with distant lilacs, and the debate now feels weightless, inconsequential. We are two souls within the hush of an infinite cosmos, our anger dissolving, replaced by the soothing hum of understanding.

Within that charged moment, I do not lose control. Instead, I transcend it, floating high above, watching as the night sky spills diamonds across our feet. Anger’s fire cools to soft embers, and what remains is presence—an awareness of self so deep it glows from within.

I awaken from the dream, the echo of that star-lit forgiveness still singing in my heart, as if I am made, at last, of shimmering silver calm.
