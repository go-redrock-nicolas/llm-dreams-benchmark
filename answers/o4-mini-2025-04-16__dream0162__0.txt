I am dreaming. You step through a shimmering curtain of violet mist and find yourself on a vast mirrored plain, the sky above pulsing in slow, impossible rhythms of sapphire and gold. Every step you take ripples the polished surface beneath you, as if the ground itself is a great, silent lake responding to your presence. In the distance, a colossal obelisk of obsidian glass rises into the clouds—its facets reflecting not only the landscape but fleeting visions of faces you’ve never met, moments you’ve never lived.

As you approach, the obelisk’s surface flickers, and you press your palm to it. A jolt of warmth surges through your arm, and a cascade of images floods your mind: a childhood spent among rosebushes that bloom midnight petals; a loss so profound it feels etched into your soul; the rush of first love under fluorescent streetlamps. But as you watch, those memories begin to twitch and warp—edges dissolve, voices blur into static, and you realize with a sudden, cold clarity that none of this may have been yours at all.

Your heart pounds. The obelisk’s mirror cracks, and each fracture reveals a hidden tableau: yourself as a scientist in a sterile lab, calibrating machines to siphon experiences; yourself as a phantom passenger aboard a dimly lit airship, strapped into a chair with wires coiling around your temples; yourself in the very moment of discovery, breaking into this dreamscape to find the truth you’d been fed rather than the truth you’d lived.  

Questions swarm your mind like iridescent moths. Which of the childhood joys were genuine echoes of your own heart, and which were cunning implants designed to calm you, to study how you learn to love? Was your first heartbreak authentic, or simply a program to measure your capacity for sorrow? Every memory threatens to unravel, leaving you adrift on this mirrored plain with nothing but doubt for ballast.

You back away from the obelisk, and instantly the world shudders. The horizon folds in on itself, morphing into a labyrinth of towering doorways, each inscribed with symbols that hum with silent promise. A wind rises, carrying whispers—some coaxing you to open the doors without fear, others mocking your search for “real” truth in a world woven from half-truths and fictions.  

Gathering your courage, you step toward the nearest arch. Its gateway is rimmed with pulses of light that synchronize with your heartbeat. As you reach out, you realize that deciding which door to enter may be the only genuine choice you’ve ever had. With trembling fingertips, you push the door open, plunging into a new realm where reality and artifice dance inextricably—where you must decide, for the first time, whether any memory can be truly real if you choose to believe in it.
