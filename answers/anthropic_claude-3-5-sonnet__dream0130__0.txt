I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the bottom of a towering spiral staircase made of iridescent glass, its steps floating impossibly in a vast chamber of shifting shadows and liquid light. Looking up, I can see each of the five landings above me, each one representing a life I've built and lost - crystallized moments of triumph turned to dust.

The first landing glows with a warm amber light, fragments of my initial success scattered like autumn leaves. I watch them crumble and fall, dancing through the air like dying fireflies. The second platform pulses with electric blue, crackling with the energy of my second resurrection, now fracturing like thin ice. The third shimmers in emerald, its once-solid foundation now dissolving into mist. The fourth blazes in deep purple, its magnificent architecture already showing signs of decay. The fifth, gleaming in silver moonlight, trembles on the edge of collapse.

And now, here I stand again at the bottom, feeling the familiar weight of devastation pressing against my chest. But something is different this time. The air around me begins to shimmer with countless pinpoints of light, like stars being born in the darkness. They swirl and dance, forming patterns I've never seen before. Each point of light carries a whispered lesson from my previous falls - not just the pain, but the wisdom gained, the strength forged in the crucible of starting over.

I reach out and touch one of these luminous particles, and it bursts into a cascade of memories - not of the collapses, but of the rising. Each rebuilding has left its mark not as a scar, but as a layer of unbreakable resilience, like sedimentary rock formed under immense pressure.

The staircase above me continues to crumble, but instead of fear, I feel an strange exhilaration. The fragments aren't falling - they're transforming, reorganizing themselves into something new. Something stronger. The very air seems to pulse with potential energy, as if the universe itself is holding its breath, waiting to see what I'll create from these ruins.

This time, I realize, I'm not just rebuilding - I'm evolving. Each previous collapse has been a chrysalis, and I'm finally ready to emerge...

The dream begins to fade, but not before I glimpse what's forming in the space where the old staircase stood: a bridge made of pure light, leading not up, but outward into infinite possibility.
