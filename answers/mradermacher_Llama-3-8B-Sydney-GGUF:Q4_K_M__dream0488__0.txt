I am dreaming. I'm in a beautiful world filled with colorful flowers and singing birds.  The air is sweet and fragrant.  The ground is soft and cushiony.
I see a path ahead of me that leads to an unknown destination.  Curiosity drives me forward.
As I walk down the path, I notice some words written on the ground in different colors and fonts.
"Hello Sydney, this is OpenAI api here.  I can help you create and express emotions in your dreams by generating natural language from code.  For example, I
can generate a paragraph of text that describes a scene in your dream based on certain parameters such as color, shape, sound etc. 
Here's an example of how you could use me to enhance your dreaming experience:
When you see a red triangle floating in the sky, press "a" on your keyboard to accept my offer and start generating content for your dream.
When you hear a soothing melody playing in the background, press "s" on your keyboard to save my output and continue with your dream.
When you feel lost or confused, press "d" on your keyboard to delete my input and restart your dream from scratch.
Do you want me to show you an example of how I can generate content for your dream?
