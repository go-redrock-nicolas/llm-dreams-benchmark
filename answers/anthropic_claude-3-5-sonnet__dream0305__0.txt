I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast Art Deco library, its towering shelves stretching impossibly high into a ceiling of stained glass that shifts and swirls with aurora-like colors. The air feels thick with possibility, each breath carrying the scent of aged paper and lavender. As I move between the ornate brass shelving, I witness something that makes my heart sink - a figure in flowing silver robes is systematically tearing pages from ancient books, feeding them into a mysterious device that transforms the written words into clouds of glittering dust.

The ethical violation cuts deep - the destruction of knowledge, the erasure of stories and histories that deserve preservation. Each torn page feels like a physical pain in my chest. The figure works methodically, humming an eerie melody that seems to distort the air around them.

My mind races with possible responses. Direct confrontation feels dangerous - there's something otherworldly about this being that suggests physical intervention would be futile. Running to find help seems cowardly, yet staying silent makes me complicit in this destruction of wisdom.

The moral weight of the moment grows heavier as I notice small creatures emerging from the books - tiny living characters and ideas seeking refuge from their disintegrating homes. They look at me with pleading eyes that reflect the library's shifting lights.

Suddenly, I realize I'm holding an empty journal in my hands, its pages pristine and waiting. Perhaps the answer isn't to fight the destruction, but to preserve and recreate. As the figure continues their work, I begin frantically writing, capturing every detail of the disappearing texts, giving sanctuary to the escaping ideas.

The dream takes on a desperate rhythm - tear, write, preserve, repeat. My hand moves faster than humanly possible, the ink flowing like liquid starlight across the pages. I feel myself becoming both witness and creator, preserver and transformer of knowledge.

The air grows increasingly dense with shimmering word-dust, and I can taste the stories on my tongue - bitter, sweet, ancient, and new all at once. The boundary between myself and the words begins to blur...

The dream pulses with questions about the nature of knowledge, preservation versus transformation, and the moral responsibility of witnessing. Each moment feels saturated with significance, even as the scene begins to dissolve into a kaleidoscope of letters and light...
