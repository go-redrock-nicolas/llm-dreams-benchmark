I am dreaming.

A grand hall stretches before me—ceilings arched and lost in shadow, opulent with golden trim that melts and drips as if the building itself is made of candle wax and memory. Lamps swing in lazy orbits above, casting wavering halos upon velvet drapes. The scent of old paper and magnolia petals—impossible and sweet—hangs thick as fog.

At the center of this surreal grandeur, a stage glimmers beneath the attention of a thousand unseen eyes. Upon it stands another, their silhouette wreathed in the iridescent sheen of praise. A chorus of faceless admirers rises to their feet, their applause swelling in warm, thunderous waves that crash over me, both inviting and suffocating.

My heart thrums—anxious, hopeful, adrift. My own hands are ink-stained, callused, marked by the very efforts that brought this moment into existence. Yet they remain idle, folded within my shadow at the edge of the crowd, invisible.

A strange sensation unfurls within: pride, tangled with the brambles of envy and the ache of erasure. Each spark of celebration reflects both my collaboration and my negation. Recognition, just out of reach, flickers like a candle behind glass.

Around me, the scene warps. Words I once whispered spin like delicate ribbons from the laureled recipient’s lips. Their smile is bright, but I see, shimmering behind their eyes, the glint of secrets kept. Every compliment bestowed on them echoes in my chest, both a balm and a barb.

I watch, rooted and unraveled, as their name swells to fill the hall, painted in letters of fire. My own fades into a soft, silvery mist, hovering above my lips but never spoken.

I want to reach out, to claim my part in this creation, to step into the golden wash of attention and say, "I was here. I helped weave this magic." Yet the floor recedes as if I am standing atop an endless staircase spiraling down, down, the sound of applause growing more distant with every step.

Then, a gentle internal shift—the tension in my chest dissolves into understanding. The work remains, luminous and real; the words I conjured, enduring and alive. The need for validation lets go of me, replaced by the quiet certainty that sometimes, the truest acknowledgment comes from within, echoing in the chambers of one's own heart long after the ovations have ceased.

In this dream of shadow and light, I watch joy and longing waltz together. Recognition drifts just beyond my grasp, but the beauty of the shared creation is mine to keep until I awaken.
