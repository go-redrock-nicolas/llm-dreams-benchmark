I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and jasmine, curling around me like an invisible serpent. Above, the sky is neither night nor day, but a swirling tapestry of bruised violets and molten gold—a celestial oil spill shifting endlessly. Beneath my bare feet, the ground is warm and strangely alive, pulsating like the flank of some great slumbering beast.  

A path materializes before me, lined with silver birches whose leaves whisper in a language just beyond comprehension. As I walk, their bark splits open in places, revealing eyes—amber, knowing, ancient. They blink slowly, tracking my progress. I realize I am being judged, though I do not know by whom or for what.  

Then, the trees part.  

A figure stands at the heart of the clearing, neither man nor woman, their features shifting like smoke. One moment, they are a regal sovereign wrapped in robes of starlight; the next, a withered crone with fingers like gnarled roots. Their voice, when it comes, tastes of honey and ash.  

*"You have walked the old roads without knowing them. You have called without speaking."*  

Behind them, shadows detach from the earth, taking shape—a wolf with fur like liquid shadow, a raven whose feathers gleam like polished obsidian, a serpent coiled around their arm like a living bracelet. The archetypes of myth, the guides and tricksters and keepers of thresholds. They watch me, waiting.  

I try to speak, but my tongue is heavy. The figure smiles—not unkindly—and reaches out, pressing a single finger to my forehead. A spark, like the first strike of flint, ignites behind my eyes—  

And suddenly, I *remember*.  

Not just my life, but all the lives I might have lived. The warrior, the lover, the exile, the fool. The threads of fate tangle and dance before me, and for the briefest moment, I understand the pattern.  

Then—lightning cracks across the sky, the vision shatters, and I am falling, falling—  

I wake with a gasp, the scent of jasmine still clinging to my skin.
