I am dreaming. I'm in my 47yr old suburban body, but I'm back in my college dorm at Duke University. 

It's morning and I hear a lot of movement in the hallway--doors opening and closing a  lot and the shuffle and light thud of feet and of rolling luggage--it's the end of the school year and summer break starting. 

I feel a mix of excitement bubbling up inside me, but also a low thrumming dread. It's the feeling of being free to take on the open road of uncharted adventurous possibilities that lay before me combined with a tense regret of things left unsaid and undone. 

I had had a crush on a girl named Marisa all semester. She had just broken up with her boyfriend and we became fast friends commiserating about our breakups, getting coffee together,  walking through the Duke gardens around the corner from our dorm, long bullsessions about life and philosophy. She admits she is in a vulnerable emotional state from her breakup, and after one long vulnerable conversation after midnight in my dorm room, we share a long embrace.

The past months I had been trying to play it cool, not wanting to spook her or ruin our friendship or overstep while she healed from her ex. Maybe she just saw me as a friend and I didn't want to ruin that. I kept my feelings in check, telling myself I was doing the noble thing.

But now it's the last day of school and people are shuffling out and I'm hit with a wave of regret at my reticence. Packing up my room, everything is put away in boxes and I glance around at the empty walls and desk and realize there is nothing keeping me here anymore. The seconds are counting down and the window of opportunity to tell Marisa how I feel is closing fast...

Just then, there's a knock at my door and I freeze. Through the peephole I see it's Marisa. I take a deep breath, open the door and she's standing there in the sundress she wore on the first day of spring that kicks up slightly in the breeze, mimicing the light airflowery feeling that always got kicked up in my chest around her.

Before she can say anything I have an out of body experience. I watch myself blurt out to her rapid fire that I have had a crush on her for months and replay all the times we shared in fast forward and how I wanted to tell her a hundred times but thought I was doing the right thing giving her space but now that the year is over I must tell her that I love her before it's too late and I'll always regret it if I don't.

She looks stunned. My heart pounds. The moment seems to hang suspended in the timeless air.

And then the words intoxicate me as they leave her like the first light-headed hits of champagne fizzing in my head - "I love you too."

And we embrace and everything fades out in a swirl. . .
