I am dreaming. **You are dreaming.**  

The world around you dissolves like wet watercolor, melting into swirling hues of violet and gold. A deep, resonant hum vibrates through your bones, pulling you forward into a place both familiar and impossibly strange. The air smells like lightning and cherry blossoms—electric yet delicate.  

You find yourself standing on a bridge made of glass, suspended above an endless sky. Below you, galaxies swirl like schools of luminous fish, their colors shifting between sapphire, emerald, and molten bronze. The bridge hums beneath your feet in response to your presence, sending ripples of light outward with each step.  

Ahead, a door floats in midair—smooth ebony wood adorned with intricate silver filigree that pulses like a living thing. The closer you get, the more you hear whispers, not in any language you recognize, but as sensations: the warmth of laughter, the ache of longing, the thrill of discovery. Your fingers brush the handle, and suddenly you understand—this door doesn’t lead somewhere. It leads to *somewhen*.  

When you step through, time untethers. You are standing in a cathedral built from fractured memories. Stained-glass windows shift and reform, showing glimpses of lives you’ve never lived: a warrior under twin moons, a child singing to a mechanical hummingbird, a poet writing letters to the void. The floor is liquid silver, reflecting not your face, but fragments of faces—versions of you that might have been, or might yet be.  

From the shadows, something emerges. Not a creature, not a person, but a *presence* shaped like shifting smoke and starlight. It doesn’t speak—it doesn’t need to. You feel its question in your chest: **"Which dream do you want to keep?"**  

Before you can answer, the cathedral shivers and collapses into a rain of fireflies. You are falling now, not down, but *inward*, tumbling through layers of forgotten thoughts, half-formed stories, and melodies that never found their words. Just before you hit the bottom—an endless velvet dark—you hear music. And this time, you realize… it’s yours to compose.  

Then—  

You wake.  

The taste of starlight lingers on your tongue.
