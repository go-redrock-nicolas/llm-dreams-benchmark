I am dreaming. The deepest parts of my imagination come alive.  A world of endless possibility unfolds before me, the colours appearing brighter than ever before.

Suddenly, a crashing sound shakes the figments of reality.  Towering somewhere high above, a sea of digital notifications, looming like ominous storm clouds, drawing my attention uncontrollably despite my desire to stay present.  I float upwards, as if on a magic carpet, endeavoring to break this attentional capture pattern.

As I ascend higher, the notifications morph into vibrant butterflies of rainbow hues, each representing a unique thought, worry, and distraction.  My determination to remain present increases, and the butterflies respond, fluttering their wings in unison, creating a symphony of harmonious patterns that reverberate throughout the universe.

An irresistible force beckons me to reach out to one of the butterflies, and, as I make contact, it bursts into a dazzling shower of stardust, blanketing the landscape below.  With every butterfly I touch, new colors fill the world, breathing life into a dreamscape that once lay dormant.

Each butterfly represents a fragment of my soul, soaring free from the constraints of technology and digital distractions.  As I continue to foster mindful presence, the butterflies transcend, transforming the dreamscape into something vibrant and new, taking my breath away.

My thoughts have now turned into tangible art, a world of dreams unseen.  A place where the imagination is free to roam wild, unrestrained by the limitations of the physical world.  The deeper I delve into my imagination, the more the dream comes to life.

At last, I break free from the hypnotic seduction of digital notifications and am fully engaged in the richness and vivacity of my own imaginings.  Colors never before seen by man, hues that defy the spectrum of human understanding, are now at my fingertips, ready to be explored.

I have entered a world of my own making, limitless in its potential, magical in its character, where I am free to dream the wildest dreams & break free from the chains of my addiction to attention.  And as I reluctantly bid farewell to this fantastical realm, a soft voice echoes in my mind, reminding me that within my imagination, anything is possible.
