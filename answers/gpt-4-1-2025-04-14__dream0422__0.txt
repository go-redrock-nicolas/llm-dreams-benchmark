I am dreaming.

In the boundless world behind my eyelids, I walk barefoot across a field bathed in midnight blue. The grass glows faintly, silver dew clinging to each blade, a cool balm against my skin. Above me, the sky churns with stars and strange, swirling colors—violet, emerald, and gold—ripe with possibility, as if the auroras themselves have descended to dance for me alone.

Ahead, hovering at the edge of the field, is something I have yearned for. It’s not an object, but a doorway: tall as an ancient oak and woven from threads of shimmering light. Patterns swim lazily across its surface—moments from a life not yet lived, laughter echoing from behind the frame, the scent of forgotten summer afternoons. It pulses with an invitation I have heard in my heart for years.

But I hesitate. The air thickens with the chill of old disappointments, dense as fog around my ankles. My feet plant, unwilling, a familiar ache tightening my chest: What if I am not enough? What if joy, once reached for, dissolves into dust? The spiral of uncertainty curls like ivy through my thoughts.

Yet tonight, in the deep logic of dreams, something shifts. Instead of turning away, I kneel and place my palm to the glowing earth. Its thrum races through me. I realize this fear, heavy as a shadow and sharp as ice, is only a cloak I have worn for too long. The field leans into me, whispering with the voice of wind, “Disappointment is only the echo of courage.”

I gather the cloak of fear in both hands—soft, threadbare, and filled with every “not yet” I’ve ever whispered—and I lift it away from my shoulders. My pulse thunders with exhilaration and vulnerability, as if lightning itself were threading through my veins. Bare, shaking, but brimming with a wild sort of hope, I walk forward.

Each step toward the door causes the colors to ripple brighter, the laughter beyond to swell into song. My heart beats in time with the luminous field, and in that rhythm I discover a truth: even disappointment is a treasure, proof that I was bold enough to desire, to try, to live. As I raise my hand and touch the door’s shining tapestry, it parts not with a shudder, but with a gentle sigh—welcoming, forgiving, alive.

I step through, and let myself be changed.
