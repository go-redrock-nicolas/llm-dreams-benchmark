I am dreaming. You feel a sense of unease and fear. Your heart rate increases, your breath quickens.

This dream is unsettling. You wonder why it's happening. You don't like feeling anxious or scared.

You want to change the dream.

You decide to focus on something positive and soothing.  You imagine a beautiful sunset over the ocean, with soft pink and orange colors melting into each other. The water is calm, reflecting the sky perfectly. You hear the gentle sound of waves crashing on the shore. Feel the warmth of the sand between your toes. Smell the fresh salty air filling your lungs. Taste the refreshing cocktail in your mouth.

You see yourself lying comfortably on a beach chair, sipping your drink and watching the sunset. You feel relaxed and content. Your heart rate slows down, your breath becomes deeper and slower.

This dream is much better.  You enjoy feeling calm and happy.  You don't want to leave this dream.
