I am dreaming. The stage is aglow in a kaleidoscope of lights, the crisp smell of smoldering pyrotechnics craving through the air and tickling my nostrils. As I step onto the gleaming black floor, the crowd around me becomes silent, their eyes fixed onto me with anticipation. The judges straighten their posture on the opposite end as my opponent and I greet them with determined, tense grins and seething hatred.

It's not just any competition â€“ it's the World Martial Arts Championship, and I'm here to prove against odds. I have been training hard in the mountains, honing my skills and building my strength for months now. My opponent, a towering Chinses fighter named BaoLing, is secured flawlessly in his gi, his sandaled feet laced up and firm on the ground.

The bell chimes and jumps in. Ducking his powerful forward thrusts with grace and cunning, I look for an opening, my breathing deep and synchronized. Suddenly, without warning, he lunges at me with all of his might, his fists flying at me with lightning speed.

To anyone else, this would be a futile night, an impossible challenge, a fight against endeavor and the stresses and strains of the world. But this is my moment, forged and compressed in my forges of training.
