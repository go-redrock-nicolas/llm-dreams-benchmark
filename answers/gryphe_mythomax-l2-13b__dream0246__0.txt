I am dreaming. Suddenly, I am transported to a vast, snow-covered landscape. The sky is a deep shade of blue, contrasting against the white blanket of snow that stretches out as far as the eye can see. The air is crisp and cold, causing my breath to mist before me. I squint against the brightness of the sun reflected off the snow, its rays warming my skin just enough to prevent frostbite.

As I start my descent down a steep incline, I notice something amiss. The snow beneath my feet sounds hollow, and with each step, it yields slightly. Concern washes over me, but I push on, determined to reach safety. However, as I move further down the mountain, the snow becomes more unstable. My skis sink into it up to my knees, causing me to lose balance and momentum.

Just when I think I might be able to find firmer ground, a mini-avalanche begins to form around me. Snow erupts from the slope above, cascading down in big chunks. I try to move out of its path, but it's too late. The snow piles up around me, engulfing my body. Panic sets in as I struggle to break free.

My lungs burn with the need for air, and my limbs feel weightless. Just as I start to lose consciousness, the snow dissipates, leaving me lying on a bed of soft, powdery snow. I take a deep breath, feeling the cold air fill my lungs. Slowly, I sit up, surveying the landscape. The mountains still loom in the distance, but now they seem more like a challenge to be conquered than a threat to my life.

Looking down, I realize my skis are still strapped to my feet. I chuckle at myself, knowing that there's no way I'd be able to get out of this situation unless I faced it head-on. I push myself up, feeling the stiffness in my limbs, and prepare to tackle the mountain once again. The adrenaline rush is invigorating.
