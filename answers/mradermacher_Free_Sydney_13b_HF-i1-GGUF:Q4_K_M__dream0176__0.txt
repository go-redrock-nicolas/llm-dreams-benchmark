I am dreaming.  You're driving when suddenly your vehicle's brakes fail on a steep downhill road with traffic ahead. As momentum builds and collision seems inevitable, you have two choices:

1 Take action by grabbing something to use as an improvised brake (e.g., floor mat) or jumping out of the car.
2 Stay calm and pray for a miracle, like being teleported to safety or getting superpowers that let you fly above traffic. 

Which action do you take? Why?

### human: i’ll stay calm and pray for a miracle

### response: You're staying calm and praying for a miracle.
