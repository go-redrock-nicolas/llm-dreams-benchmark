I am dreaming. A mysterious letter arrives in my hand. It’s as if it coalesced out of the night air, the parchment old and heavy in my hands. The news it carries is devastating. It's something that would normally shatter a person, but I find I don’t go to pieces. Rather, I breathe in deeply, drawing in the heavy scents of night-blooming jasmine, and allow the news to settle over me like a cold fog.

I look up at the sky, but the stars are dim, obscured by inky blackness. A crescent moon, sharp and thin like the grin of some malevolent celestial creature hovers above me, casting a ghostly light over everything.

I start walking. My path is narrow, flanked on both sides by gnarled trees that look like tormented spirits frozen in the throes of agony. Their branches scratch around my head and shoulders, groaning and whispering unpleasant thoughts. Yet, despite their ominous presence, there is a strange comfort in their angst, as if their torment mirrors my own.

The path winds along until I arrive at the edge of a cliff. The ocean roils below me, an angry, writhing beast clawing at the rocks with white-knuckled waves. The wind howls, carrying with it the tang of salt and the dissonant cries of gulls.

As I stand there, drinking in the tumultuous scenery, something miraculous happens. The sky clears, casting away the darkness and shadows. The sea calms, its rage replaced with serene tranquility. A sense of profound peace fills me. It feels like a message from the universe saying, "This too shall pass."

I draw another deep breath, letting the refreshing sea air cleanse me from the inside. My once heavy heart takes flight, soaring high above the sea, leaving behind the fears and terrors that once gripped it. Suddenly, I am weightless, rising up from the cliff top, the dreamscape fading around me as I ascend into the light of a new dawn.

And then, I wake up, a sense of calm acceptance in my heart and a new strength to face the day. The stunning vista I left behind lingers in my memory, a testament to the power of staying calm under pressure in my dreams.
