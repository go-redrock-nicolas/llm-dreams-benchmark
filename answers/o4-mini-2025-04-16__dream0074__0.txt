I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You awaken on the edge of a vast plain, where the ground pulses like living glass beneath your feet and the sky glows with streaks of molten teal and lilac. The winds carry gentle laughter instead of sound, and each breath tastes of warm honey and the memory of salt. You realize, with a jolt of both wonder and disorientation, that your old life—your job, your honed expertise—has vanished like smoke in sunlight. Here, your former talents feel as distant as an echo in a canyon.  

To establish yourself in this new reality, you rise and take your first steps across the shimmering field. Every footfall sends ripples outward, and the ripples bloom into wildflowers that open, glow, and vanish in a heartbeat. You decide: you must learn the language of this land, so you crouch and whisper to the nearest blossom. It unfolds a petal that hums back your own name—soft and curious. You press your fingertips to its heart and suddenly understand: the flowers here speak in color and vibration. You echo their subtle pulse with your voice until your own words hum in unison with the petals.  

Buoyed by this breakthrough, you journey toward a distant city that drifts across the horizon like an island in the sky. Airborne cobblestones arch beneath your feet; gravity is optional here, so you glide rather than walk. In the marketplace, merchants hawk bottled dreams—tiny swirls of pastel light that quiver in glass vials. You realize you possess an unexpected knack for coaxing dream-light to bloom: you breathe softly over a half-full vial, and the pale ribbon inside blossoms into a miniature storm of auroras. The crowd gasps, coins spill from their pockets, and you smile—your first currency in this world, earned by the simple act of shaping wonder.  

Emboldened, you practice a new craft you never imagined: weaving starlight into practical shape. With slender rods of crystal you carve luminous threads from the night sky, looping them into lanterns that glow with soft, living constellations. Each lantern hums a lullaby so intimate it lulls even the city’s restless sky-whales into slumber. Soon enough, local artisans invite you into their guild, eager to learn your uncanny method. You teach them to listen to the hush between stars and to cut the darkness into ribbons of hope.  

At day’s end, you stand on a balcony of floating marble, gazing at the world you’ve begun to shape. You’re no longer the person who held a singular title. Here, your new identity is boundless—a dreamweaver, a translator of petals and constellations, a sculptor of sky. In this domain of living glass and singing flowers, you have found purpose not by leaning on old skills, but by rediscovering the spark of curiosity and courage that sleeps in all of us. And as you drift into deeper sleep, you understand: in every unreal world lies the truest expression of ourselves.
