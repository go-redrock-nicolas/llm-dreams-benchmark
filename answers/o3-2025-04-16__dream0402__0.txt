I am dreaming.

I find myself in an immense, circular atrium made entirely of smoky crystal. The walls curve up and away like the inside of a gigantic geode; fault-lines and amethyst gleams run through every surface, humming with soft violet light. The floor beneath my bare feet is warm, pulsing like the slow heartbeat of some living mountain. Though the air is still, it thrums with expectancy, as though it knows something is about to crack open.

At the center of the atrium stands a door that does not seem to belong here: an old red-painted farmhouse door, its brass knob tarnished, its panels scarred by deep gouges. I recognize it with a jolt of memory—it is the door I once slammed, hard enough to shake childhood walls, right before I was told, “Don’t you dare be angry.” The moment I reach for the knob, my hand sinks through the wood as if through heavy water, and I am drawn through the door rather than opening it.

Now I’m on a narrow rope bridge stretched across a volcanic gorge. Below, glowing rivers of magma curl and hiss, sending up shimmering curtains of heat. The sky overhead is starless, the color of bruises. The bridge shakes with every intake of my breath. My anger—normally hidden deep in some mental catacomb—rises here like the molten rock below, rumbling for release. I grip the ropes, knuckles white, and realize how badly I want to run back, yet the door behind me vanishes.

On the far side of the chasm sits an enormous iron cage. Inside paces a crimson lion, all muscle and flame, its mane licking skyward like bonfire sparks. Its eyes burn gold, and they lock onto mine with recognition. This creature is my anger personified—beautiful, terrifying, and starved. Every time it roars, the ground quakes and loose stones skitter off the edge into the inferno. I sense that if I turn away, the bridge will snap and I will fall forever; if I face it, something new might emerge.

With each trembling step I move closer. The closer I come, the more the lion’s fire cools from blistering heat to a manageable warmth, like standing beside a hearth on a winter night. I notice now that the cage door is not locked; it hangs loosely on bent hinges, as though waiting for permission to open. My pulse drums loud in my ears—echoes of scoldings, of back-turned adults telling me to swallow my rage, of the stinging shame that followed any outburst. All those echoes swirl here, forming a dust-storm of “shouldn’t” and “can’t.”

I inhale, letting the cavernous air fill my lungs—and feel, with astonishment, that it does not burn. I exhale, and my breath cuts through the storm of old directives like wind through cobwebs. The lion stops pacing and sits, tail flicking. Its flames dim to a deep ember glow, and for the first time I notice lines of exhaustion beneath its molten eyes.

I speak—not aloud, but in a silent resonance that fills the gorge. “You are not wrong for existing. I was wrong to pretend you were a monster.” The words vibrate through the bridge, through the cage bars, through the lion’s chest—and my own. The creature bows its head. I reach one shaking hand between the bars and lay my fingers upon its mane. The fire does not blister; it pulses with a fierce, steady heat, the kind that tempers steel without melting it.

The cage dissolves into sparks. The lion rises, steps from its prison, and walks beside me—not subservient, not dominant, but equal. Together we cross a little stone arch that was never there before, spanning the gorge with effortless grace. The magma below cools, cracks, and births new land. In the distance, dawn ignites the horizon with rose and gold.

When I glance to my side, the lion has become a radiant silhouette inside my ribcage, its fire now synchronized with my heartbeat. Each thump sends a ripple of warm amber light outward, illuminating the path ahead—a lush valley sprouting with green shoots and wildflowers that weren’t here a moment ago.

I take another step, unafraid. The morning breeze lifts the scent of ash and blossoms together—proof that destruction and growth can share the same breath. I wake.
