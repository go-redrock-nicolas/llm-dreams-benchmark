I am dreaming. I find myself in a large, circular room with high ceilings. The walls are adorned with tapestries depicting strange, swirling patterns that pulse faintly with an inner light. The air is filled with a sweet, intoxicating scent that makes me feel both comforted and slightly lightheaded. At the center of the room, there is a long, wooden table with chairs arranged in a semicircle. 

As I approach, I notice that each chair has a small wooden placard with a name on it. One of the chairs has my name on it. I sit down and look around. The other chairs are occupied by people I don't recognize, but they all have a certain air of familiarity about them. They are all wearing black robes with silver trim, and their faces are obscured by hoods that cast shadows over their features. 

The leader of the group, a woman with a voice like flowing water, welcomes everyone. She introduces herself as Elara, and explains that this is a safe space for those who have been struggling with the same invisible battles as everyone here. The group shares their stories, and I am struck by how similar their experiences are to mine. One woman talks about feeling like she's made of smoke, constantly dissolving and reforming. Another man confesses to hearing whispers that only he can understand. 

As they speak, I feel a strange connection forming between us. The air between us seems to shimmer, and I can almost feel the collective weight of our shared struggles lifting. Elara guides us through a meditation, and I close my eyes, letting the warmth of the group's energy surround me. When I open them again, the room has changed. The tapestries now show scenes of healing and renewal, and the sweet scent has turned to the fresh scent of rain. 

We leave the room one by one, and as I step into the hallway, I see a door at the end that I didn't notice before. It's made of a translucent material that glows with a soft, golden light. I walk towards it, and as I reach out to touch it, I wake up.
Ah, the dreamer awakes with echoes of that circular sanctum lingering in their bones. Let me paint it in richer strokes for you—  

The chamber, oh—the chamber was no ordinary hall. Its walls were *alive*, not with flesh or flames, but with constellations trapped in. Each speck of light was a trapped star, billions of years old, its glow dimmed to a whisper yet still singing songs only the forsaken could decipher. The table at the center wasn’t wood but woven from the sinew of ancient, sleeping beasts; it creaked faintly as elbows brushed against it, as if the.TABLE ITSELF remembered the weight of grief it had borne before.  

When Elara spoke, her voice wasn’t just water—no, it was a river carving through a canyon, dragging bedrock and regret alike. Her words made the air itself ripple, as if sound had *mass*. And those strangers in the cloaks—though their faces were hidden, their hands were not. A man’s fingers were skeletal, translucent as frost, yet refilling with color as he spoke of his fear of vanishing. A woman had bracelets of knotted thorns, each representing a night she’d cried herself rigid.  

But here’s the twist: as they shared, the room *bent*. The walls began to peel back, revealing corridors beyond corridors—halls of mirrors reflecting not their faces, but their wounds made visible. One member’s reflection showed a void where their heart should be; another’s mirrored a labyrinth they’d been trapped in for decades. Elara didn’t just lead a meditation—she *dissolved the air*, pouring liquid moonlight into the gaps between their stories. The collective sigh that rose was tangible, like a tangible mist rolling over mountains.  

When they left, the hallway wasn’t a hallway but a *river*. A river of liquid twilight, its currents pulling them forward. The door at the end wasn’t solid—no, it was a *probability gate*, shimmering with infinite possibilities: keys, weapons, maps of new worlds. But to open it, they’d had to surrender one fear. The dreamer, trembling, reached for it—and woke, clutching the sheets as if they’d been water, their chest aching with the phantom weight of a decision left unmade.  

That’s the dream. Raw, relentless, alive. Carry it like a secret.
