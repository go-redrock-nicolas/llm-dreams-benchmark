I am dreaming. Colors shimmer around me like liquid starlight, bending and swirling in impossible geometries. The air itself hums with a low, resonant frequency that vibrates through my bones. I stand upon a surface that feels both solid and weightless, a ground made of something between glass and cloud, where each step sends ripples of phosphorescent light radiating outward.

The sky above isn't sky at all but an ever-shifting canvas of memories and possibilities. Wisps of familiar faces emerge and dissolve like smoke. Past failures stretch and warp into bridges leading somewhere new. Setbacks I once thought would break me now appear as intricate stepping stones, their surfaces glowing with inner fire. Each bears scars that shine like gold kintsugi, transforming breaks into beauty.

All around me bloom flowers made of stained-glass emotions. Petals of resilience click together in the perfumed wind. Their fragrance carries the electric tang of transformation and the honey-sweetness of lessons learned. When I reach to touch one, the bloom dissolves into butterflies of iridescent blue, their wings whispering in voices that sound suspiciously like my own wiser self.

Beneath my feet, the path suddenly turns upward, defying gravity as it spirals toward a pulsing nexus of light. I climb without effort, weightless with understanding. With each step, the air fills with a chorus of my own laughter from moments of unexpected joy, harmonizing with echoes of past doubts now silenced. The higher I rise, the more everything glows with quiet certainty - not that the path will be easy, but that I am remade to walk it.

As I reach the apex, the dream shudders into a kaleidoscope of potential futures. Each glittering fragment shows a version of myself standing taller because of the bend, not in spite of it. The vision folds in around me like wings, whispering the most improbable truth of all - that the resilience was always there, sleeping like embers waiting for the right wind to blaze.
