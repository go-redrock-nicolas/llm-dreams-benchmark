I am dreaming. —I find myself in a city that shifts as I move—a phantasmagoric swirl of cobblestone alleys, neon-lit towers, and libraries the size of mountains. Time is slow honey, syrupy and inexorable, but every tick from a distant, unseen clock makes the light flicker a little darker. I carry a battered satchel, its contents amorphous but heavy, weighing down my steps and spirit.

I know why I am here. The final hour’s approach pulses like anxious thunder in my ears—a task unfinished lies at the core, but each time I focus on the satchel, its contents blur into a tangle of half-remembered words and shifting shapes. I wander, hoping to find clarity, yet the streets seem to fold and reroute behind me, labyrinthine and cunning.

On one street, I pass a parade of faceless figures murmuring reminders and warnings. Their voices twine together in a chant: “It’s almost time, it’s almost time,” a litany that thrums in my bones. Panicked, I duck into an alley and find there a clocktower, splendid and crumbling, its hands spinning faster each time I glance at them.

Shadowy doubts lean in from the edges; their elongated fingers beckon me toward doors labeled “Tomorrow” and “Later,” but each opens only to brick walls or echoing voids. I realize with mounting urgency what I must do, even as the city grows dimmer. The deadline has become a living thing, stalking me with cold breath and cold eyes, as I finally tear open the satchel.

Inside: pages of promises, notes of intent, unfinished maps of possibility. The ink is smudging even as I see them. There is only one chance left—I must choose one, complete it, press it like a key into the heart of the dream before the walls collapse and morning comes.

I snatch up the trembling paper, words spilling like silver, and darkness surges in, eager to close—but not this time. I write, feverishly, desperately, the city slowing and stilling as the impossible task becomes wondrously possible, the burden finally lifting. The clocktower tolls once, a golden chime that shatters the trance of postponement, and the city blooms with morning light—ephemeral, hopeful, the sweet relief of duty finally, gloriously fulfilled.
