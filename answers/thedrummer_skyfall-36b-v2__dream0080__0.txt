I am dreaming. The scene unfolds in vivid technicolor before my eyes as my conscious mind sleeps.  I find myself standing at the threshold of an ancient, crumbling stone archway, its surface covered in intricate carvings that dance and shift as I gaze upon them. Behind me stretches a bleak, barren landscape, scorched by a relentless sun and devoid of life. But before me, the archway beckons, an oasis of lush greenery and life beyond. 

I pass through the portal and emerge into a breathtaking vista. Towering trees with leaves like shimmering gold reach for the sky, their branches laden with sweet-smelling fruit. Fragrant flowers carpet the forest floor in a riot of color, from the deepest crimson to the palest lavender. Crystalline streams flow through the underbrush, their waters clear and inviting. It's as if I've stepped into a living painting.

But something is not quite right. The idyllic scene is marred by an unsettling stillness, a heavy silence that hangs in the air like a pall. No birdsong, no buzzing insects, no soft rustle of leaves in a breeze. An eerie calm that makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

I walk further into the unreal forest, hugging my arms around myself against the sudden chill. The sky darkens, an inky black displacing the golden rays that had illuminated the trees mere moments before. Fireflies begin to blink on and off in an almost hypnotic rhythm, and I realize with a start that the lights are spelled out, forming recognizable words that flicker and fade:

"Your hardest work" 

"Crumbled to dust"

"Hopes once held dear"

"What if I hide?" 

"Dreaming was pointless"

Those last three words ring out like a dirge, sending a jolt of shock through my system. How does this dream know of my struggle, my shattered aspirations and broken dreams? The tears come unbidden, hot and searing as they track down my cheeks.

The scene shifts, the vivid forest melting away to reveal a shadowy void. I'm back outside the stone archway, staring out at the barren wasteland once more. The once colorful carvings now appear grayscale and peeling, the intricate patterns faded away to edge into illegibility. 

But there, on the distant horizon, a tiny spark ignites in the stark grayness. Like a candle's flame swaying in the night, it flickers, waxes, and grows. More sparks join it, then more and more, until a dazzling starfield blossoms across the sky. They pulse and swell, the light hums and vibrates, filling me with a strange, trembling sense of power. 

The sparks coalesce into the shapes of people, the ones I care for most holding literal sparks in their outstretched hands. My mother's gentle smile, my partner's reassuring nod, my closest friends standing strong and unwavering. They seem to be telling me something:

"It's okay to have another dream. There's strength in picking ourselves up. We can keep going, building something beautiful from the broken pieces."

The message echoes inside my head, and I feel the flickering embers of hope rise up, first as a warm glow, then as an ember within me. It grows and grows, spreading through me. The spark leap from my heart to the barren earth before me, and it comes alive again with brilliant colors and lush foliage.

The dream fades then, and I'm waking up, wiping away tears and smiling through them. The vision lingers at the edges of my waking mind, not cruel or frightening, but artistic and moving and strangely comforting. The archway hangs there at the boundary between sleep and consciousness, waiting for me to walk through it and face a world that doesn't have to be so bleak if I'm willing to fight for the light again.
