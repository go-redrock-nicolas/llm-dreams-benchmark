I am dreaming. You drift through a corridor of liquid glass—each step sends ripples of moonlight dancing across the walls. The air tastes of ozone and wild lavender. Ahead, an open door yawns, revealing an office twisted into a forest: desks sprout branches, keyboards are mottled with moss, and the overhead fluorescents glow like phosphorescent mushrooms. You realize, somewhere in this half-light, your work papers have taken root, leaves unfurling where your paragraphs once lay.

A voice, smooth as silk and sharp as the crack of a whip, calls your name. You turn. There stands your colleague—tall, elegant, eyes gleaming like obsidian mirrors. In one hand they cradle a pen, its nib dripping ink that pools on the floor like spilled black wine. Every time they write, a line of your report vanishes into the shadows. You feel a cold trickle of betrayal snake up your spine.

Heart pounding, you step forward. The corridor bends; glass walls bow inward, trapping you. Your colleague’s lips curl into a polite smile. “Lovely work,” they purr. “But I prefer my own version.” With a flick of that pen, your conclusions blur and dissolve.

Rage flares in your chest, and suddenly the world fractures into kaleidoscopic shards. The floor gives way to mist, and you’re falling—slowly, deliberately—through layers of color. You pass through an inverted skyline of floating buildings, each one rigid and gray, each one stamped with your name. The closer you get, the more you recognize how each structure has been hollowed out, windows boarded, foundations undermined.

Then, like waking from half a nightmare, you find yourself before a great oak pulsing with inner light. At its base lies a crumpled manuscript—your manuscript—glowing with every word you ever wrote. Branches quiver, shedding pages that flutter to the ground. You reach out, fingers brushing the illuminated pages, and you feel a surge of power: every idea you’ve ever nurtured, every argument you’ve refined, flows back into you.

Above, your colleague appears at the top of the oak’s trunk, perched on a high, crooked limb. Their elegant mask shatters, revealing something smaller and more fragile—a mockingbird with feathers of charcoal. It flaps its wings once, unleashing a swirl of black feathers that scatter through the branches, trying to choke out your light.

But the oak responds to you, its roots stirring beneath your feet, unveiling a glowing pen forged from pure starlight. You grasp it, feeling warmth spread through your hand. With one deliberate stroke across the bark, words bloom in silver: “Integrity endures.” The feathers dissipate in sparks of violet flame. The oak hums in triumph, and the pages of your work weave themselves together—stronger, clearer, more luminous than before.

Your colleague—the mockingbird—takes one last shuddering breath, then dissolves into a flurry of iridescent motes, scattering like sparks on the wind. The forest-office brightens into dawn’s soft gold. Desks straighten themselves; vines slide back into the walls. You stand tall, manuscript in hand, heart still humming with victory.

You awaken to the faint chime of your real-world alarm. Sunlight filters through your curtains, and for a moment, the echo of that luminous oak remains in your chest: a reminder that in even the strangest, most unsettling dreams, your own clarity and conviction can banish any betrayal.
