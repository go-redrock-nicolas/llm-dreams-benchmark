I am dreaming. I find myself suddenly materialized in the heart of an opulent ballroom, its ceiling stretching impossibly high with crystalline chandeliers that seem to float like jellyfish in a midnight sea. The light they cast isn't merely illumination but something alive—dancing, shifting, creating shadows that whisper secrets to one another in forgotten languages.

I'm searching for someone—the only familiar face in this labyrinth of strangers. Each person I pass wears clothing that shifts with their movements, fabrics transforming from silk to smoke to liquid starlight. Their laughter echoes with unusual resonance, as if traveling through water before reaching my ears.

I approach a circle of figures engaged in animated conversation, their gestures leaving trails of luminescent color in the air. As I draw nearer, they turn to me with eyes that reflect impossible geometries—some with pupils shaped like crescents, others with irises that rotate like clockwork. They smile with perfect teeth that seem too numerous, too white.

"Have you seen—" I begin, but my voice produces butterflies instead of words, azure wings carrying my question away into the high corners of the room.

A woman wearing a dress of autumn leaves and winter frost takes my arm. Her touch feels like déjà vu. "They're waiting in the library that isn't there anymore," she says with perfect logic that only makes sense in this moment, pointing toward a spiral staircase that both ascends and descends simultaneously.

The staircase leads me to a corridor where the walls breathe gently and portraits follow me with eyes that blink in synchronization with my heartbeat. The floor beneath me alternates between cool marble and soft moss, responding to thoughts I didn't realize I was having.

At the corridor's end stands a door made of water, perpetually flowing yet somehow solid. Beyond it lies not the person I seek, but a garden where the plants grow downward from a soil-ceiling, their flowers closing when I look directly at them, opening when glimpsed from peripheral vision.

The sensation of searching intensifies, becoming almost musical—a melody of longing that colors the air around me in shades of indigo and bronze. I know with dream-certainty that finding this person is both impossible and inevitable, a paradox that feels entirely natural in this realm where logic bends like warm taffy.

And somewhere, deep beneath the architecture of this dream, I sense the familiar presence I seek—not as a person anymore, but as the gravity holding this entire impossible world together.
