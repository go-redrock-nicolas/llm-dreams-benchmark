I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of mountain sage and damp earth, though I’m not sure if I’m indoors or out — perhaps both at once. A strange light filters through the sky, neither moon nor sun, casting the world in a golden-blue twilight. I drift into a clearing… or maybe a hall, its roof open, revealing swirling constellations that shift and sigh as though breathing. Around me emerge shadowy figures, undefined at first, like memories blurred by time. They do not speak. Instead, their voices come to me not through the ears, but the heart — as if they were memory-born, part of me and apart all at once.

They are the survivors. My kin.

One reaches for me — not with arms, but with silence. A tall figure woven of autumn leaves and silence, their skin etched with lines of stories — stories of abandonment, silence, the slow seep of pain that once threatened to drown. Another comes close — their breath visible though the air is warm, their eyes shaped like tears, their body lined with scars that glow softly.

As they welcome me into their circle, I feel the ground beneath shift from soil to mirror — a great, silver expanse that reflects not our faces, but our shared stories. For a moment, I see myself not as I was, nor as I am, but as I might be — unshackled by wounds, softened by time and care.

They draw closer, and as they do, I notice what changes in me: the spiral of shame that once lived in my chest begins to unravel, its tendrils dissolving into silken threads that lift like mist and scatter in a breeze only we can feel.

A woman steps forward, adorned in a cloak of woven starlight. She carries no tools, no medicine; yet when she gestures, I feel warmth bloom behind my breastbone. She does not cure — she *remembers* — the parts of me I had buried in shadow, the laughter that once lived in my throat before fear stole it. Her healing is not in herbs or bandages but in reclamation.

The others follow suit. One sings — a note so low and full it shakes the buried bones of my soul. Another dances without movement; they dance with memory, twisting through old nightmares like autumn wind through pine. Still another paints poems in the air with smoke and sunlight, their words draping around me like a ceremony.

A child — perhaps the youngest — places their small hand on my shoulder, and in that moment, the part of me that always felt small, afraid, alone — responds. It steps out from the dark crevice where I once hid, blinking in awe.

This is not magic in the way the world pretends magic to be — crystals or spells or whispered chants. No. This is the magic of presence, of knowing you are not alone. Of being seen in totality, and still called beloved.

Joy rises in my chest — unfamiliar, untamed. I cry without pain. I remember without shame. For the first time in what feels like forever, I *dare* wonder what might grow if I were to plant myself not in fear, but in kindness.

And so I stay in the circle, cradled in the breath of the others, as time softens its grip. One day, maybe soon, maybe in a heartbeat stretched wide, I will be the one to welcome another lost soul into this twilight garden of survival.

But for now, I simply stand with them — awake in dreams, shattered in pieces, and slowly, gently, beginning to bloom.
