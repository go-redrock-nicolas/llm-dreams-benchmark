I am dreaming. The air around me is thick like honey, each breath a laborious draw. Shadows stretch long and quiver at the edges of my vision. I stand in a hallway that spirals endlessly upward, its walls lined with mirrors, each reflecting not my own face, but scenes from a life I don't recognize. Laughter rings faintly, warped, as if underwater. My feet sink into the floor, which pulses like a living thing. I clutch a key made of ice that melts and reforms in my palm. There's a door ahead, rusted shut. The keyhole weeps black liquid. If this is a dream, why does dread coil so cold around my ribs?

In the heart of the spiraling corridor, the mirrors tremble as I pass. The reflections within them are not my own—they are **yours**. A mosaic of moments I was never meant to witness: your hands burying a lock of hair under moonlight, your whispered confession to an empty room, your trembling signature on a letter that condemned a stranger. The air hums with the weight of it, a dissonant choir only I can hear. My throat burns with unspoken truths. The ice key throbs, its chill searing my skin. It whispers, *"They’ll crumble like ash if you turn it. But the door hungers."* Below my feet, the floor splits—a chasm of static and moth-wing whispers. Your laughter sharpens into a scream. I choose: swallow the key, let cold truth dissolve my bones. The mirrors shatter. Your face, finally still, gazes back. Untouched. Unknowing. The dream unravels, but my ribs cradle the frost forever.
