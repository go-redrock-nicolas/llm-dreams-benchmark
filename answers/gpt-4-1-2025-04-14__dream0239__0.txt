I am dreaming. I am drifting, weightless, through the membrane-thin threshold of sleep and waking, when suddenly I tumble through a shimmering veil and land—softly, impossibly—on what at first seems a meadow, but the grass ripples, flows, and evaporates in delicate curls like fog before my eyes. This is a realm unbound by the rules of everyday matter: objects pulse and thrum, each simultaneously adorned in the qualities of liquid, solid, and vapor. The trees are built of pearlescent crystal, yet their trunks perpetually melt into rivulets of water that pool and then rise as mist, encasing their own branches before condensing back into gem-like bark.

To move forward, I find my body adapting. My hands plasmatize at the edges, fingers momentarily fusing together like quicksilver, then solidifying to grip the path—only for the ground beneath to dematerialize into thin steam. I must learn a new vocabulary of motion: tiptoeing on clouds that harden under my footsteps, then swimming through currents of molten glass, warm and weightless. I taste the air, sweet with the flavor of petrichor and frost, lingering on my tongue like a memory.

Every object I attempt to touch changes its state in response—a bouquet of snowflake-flowers shatters into rain, which instantly freezes, then shudders apart in bursts of metallic pollen. I navigate by intention as much as by movement; when my thoughts swirl, so too does the landscape, morphing into slick rivers I wade across, then breathing forests of vapor I drift through.

In this multiphase world, nothing can be held for long. So I learn to listen—not just with my ears, but with my whole being—to the subtle shifting symphony of matter in constant conversation with itself. Each element sings its longing to transform: ice yearning to melt, mist dreaming of solidity, stone aching to rise as steam. And as I move within this transformation, I become part of the chorus—translucent and solid and ephemeral at once, a dreamer shaped by the physics of pure imagination.
