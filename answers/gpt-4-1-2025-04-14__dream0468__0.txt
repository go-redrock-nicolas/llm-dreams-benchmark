I am dreaming.

The world around me blurs and reassembles, as if I have blinked and gone tumbling through a prism. The air tastes of bluebells and starlight, and I am standing on the edge of a lake made entirely of liquid moonbeams. The water hums with memory and possibility, casting pale reflections of impossible skies overhead—vivid streaks of emerald, cobalt, and gold swirl across the heavens. Every breath is a bell curve of silence and music.

Across the shore, ancient willow trees lean gracefully toward the glimmering surface, their roots entangled like knotted thoughts left unsaid. As I walk, silver pebbles beneath my feet emit soft chimes with each step. The gentle music soothes the turbulence I notice within myself—a familiar impulse to blurt the half-formed, the jagged, whenever stirred by emotion. Here, in this dreamscape, the atmosphere is patient and forgiving. Each word, still in chrysalis form, hovers in the air, translucent and fluttering, waiting for its wings to grow strong enough to take flight.

In this place, practicing intentional communication is like learning a new form of magic. I reach gently into the mist swirling around my thoughts, selecting my words as if choosing the ripest fruit from a tree. I let my feelings settle on the surface of the moonbeam lake, their ripples softening until clarity shimmers back at me. When I finally speak, the sound is deliberate, weaving golden threads through the silver air—a tapestry of understanding, radiant and whole.

Above, fireflies spark in the twisting branches of the willows. One lands delicately on my finger, pulsing with light that mirrors a new-found mindfulness inside me. It becomes clear: in this dream, every pause is honored, every breath counts. The world listens with me, alongside the hush of trees and the song of midnight water, as I practice choosing words shaped by presence and care. And in this luminous silence, communication becomes not just speaking, but a gentle dance—where meaning, emotion, and wisdom glide together, leaving behind trails of stardust in the waking dawn.
