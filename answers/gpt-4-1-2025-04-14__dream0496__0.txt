I am dreaming.

In the soft twilight of the dreaming world, I find myself floating down a corridor of impossible colors, walls shifting and pulsing in iridescent waves—cobalt dissolving into honey, crimson glowing like embers under moonlit water. The air hums with the scent of rain-soaked earth and sweet, unknown flowers.

Ahead, the corridor opens to a vast library—not filled with books, but with doorways. Each door frame thrums with a gentle warmth, and inside each one, a unique vista hums with possibility: a velvet forest rustling with silver-leafed trees and whispering wind; an ocean speckled with floating lanterns that rise like galaxies into the indigo sky.

Instead of judging the strangeness, I cradle curiosity in my chest like a glowing pearl. With each open question, the scenery responds. As I wonder about the silver-leafed trees, one bends low, revealing tiny creatures sculpting dreams out of dandelion fluff, giggling as they toss them into the wind. I am not a stranger here, but an explorer, led by awe and wonder rather than caution and critique.

I follow a lantern-lit path along the water’s edge, noticing how each step changes the song of the waves—sometimes laughter, sometimes the hush of slumber. My heart feels feather-light. The farther I go, the more the dream-world unfolds—not as a puzzle to solve, but as a living story eager for a co-author.

A floating city shimmers into being above the water, its bridges looping between clouds. I step onto a silver archway and meet a figure woven from starlight and velvet shadows. Instead of fear or skepticism, curiosity guides my greeting. “Who are you?” I ask, and the figure’s laughter sounds like windchimes kissed by a gentle breeze.

“I am possibility,” the figure replies, eyes twinkling with the promise of all that could be. “You let me in when you chose to wonder instead of judge.”

Together, we soar over the city, painting new skies with questions. Below, every corner blossoms with radiant potential, and curiosity becomes the key that unlocks each hidden marvel. The dream feels infinite—an endless adventure shaped by openness, where the unknown is not to be feared, but treasured.
