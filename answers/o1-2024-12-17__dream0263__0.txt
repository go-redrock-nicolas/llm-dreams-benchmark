I am dreaming.

Everything is overwhelming yet strangely exhilarating. I’m standing at the center of a vast circular atrium whose walls are made of ticking clocks—dozens, hundreds, seemingly thousands—all counting down, each one set to a different time. The floor is crisp white marble, shining like polished ice under the glow of a massive skylight. Overhead, the sky is awash in swirling tones of amethyst and rose, as if dawn is in a constant loop trying to break through spine-chilling night.

Before me stands a tall, curved desk shaped like a crescent moon, covered in an impossible tangle of papers, blueprints, digital tablets, half-drunk cups of coffee, and a flurry of sticky notes in neon colors. They float upward like miniature balloons when I slide them aside. Each document or device blinks urgently, each with an alert or a reminder that time is slipping by. My heart drums in my chest, synchronized in some bizarre way with the rhythmic ticking of the clocks on the walls. 

The space around me flexes and pulsates. It feels like I am in the command center of an interdimensional corporation, required to juggle responsibilities that span universes. One moment, I’m reviewing a blueprint for a sprawling architectural project that must be delivered in ten minutes; the next, I’m reading lines from a script for a play that opens in twenty. Then, just as I try to focus, the blueprint morphs, shimmering out of my hands, replaced by a tablet on which dozens of urgent emails flash. The swirl of tasks circles swiftly around me, drawn into orbit like planets around the desk.

Somehow, though my head throbs, I can see and sense it all in extreme clarity—maybe because in dreams, it’s possible to be hyper-focused on every detail while simultaneously feeling the world slipping from you. Across from the desk, more requests arrive via shimmering portals, each portal arcing with electric green sparks. From these rifts, I catch glimpses of entire teams waiting on my decisions—colleagues in futuristic office spaces, frantic managers in medieval towers, close friends in an alternate dimension. Each setting begs for my input. “We need more funds!” “We need final approval!” “We need your signature by dawn!” Their voices echo in a kaleidoscopic swirl, sometimes in languages I don't even recognize. 

Sweat beads on my forehead, and the air around me crackles with tension. I move my hands over the surfaces, scanning, sorting. Suddenly, an entire row of clocks on the wall speeds up, the hands swirling so fast they blur. The sound crescendos into a wailing chorus of alarms, each second throbbing in the pit of my stomach. As my cognitive resources stretch to the limit, I feel a peculiar stillness rising inside me, cutting through the chaos.

I shift my focus, letting the crystal clarity of dream-like logic guide me, and breathe in. In that moment, the swirling notes, the flickering updates, the chiming reminders, all start to slow. The sticky notes and devices rise in spiraling motions like leaves in a soft breeze. The entire circular atrium seems to take on the hush of a cathedral. Time itself tenses, hesitates, and holds. 

Leaning over the crescent desk, I take a pen that glimmers with stardust and begin scribbling swift yet meaningful strokes on certain documents. In the dream, I somehow know exactly which tasks require attention first. I close each project’s loop with decisive flair. One by one, the portals flicker closed, the waiting teams disappearing with satisfied expressions. Clocks fade to stately quiet. My heart rate evens out to a calm, steady hum. 

And as the last echo of that frantic symphony ends, a single spotlight from the skylight bathes me in golden warmth. All at once, the papers, the digital tablets, the urgent demands vanish, drifting away on a gentle breeze like petals falling to the ground. The atrium is empty now, just me and the hush. In the dreamlike hush, I feel triumphant yet oddly wistful.

Then, with a shimmering sigh, the atrium slips away into darkness, and I am left enveloped in stillness—until I awaken, pulse racing, mind brimming with fading memories of that crystalline moment of total control amid relentless chaos.
