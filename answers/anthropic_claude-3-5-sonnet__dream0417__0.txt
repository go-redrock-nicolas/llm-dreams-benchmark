I am dreaming. I find myself in a peculiar office space where the walls seem to breathe and shift like living organisms. The fluorescent lights above pulse with an unsettling rhythm, casting strange shadows that dance across the ever-changing surfaces. My colleague sits across from me, their face continuously morphing between familiar features and completely foreign ones – sometimes appearing as someone I knew from childhood, other times as a complete stranger with unsettling characteristics.

Every time they speak, their words come out as vibrant colored ribbons that float through the air, but the colors are all wrong – muddy browns and sickly greens that make my stomach churn.
