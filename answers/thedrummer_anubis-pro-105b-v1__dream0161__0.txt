I am dreaming. I find myself traversing a narrow mountain ridge during an unexpected blizzard with rapidly deteriorating visibility. As the path becomes increasingly treacherous and my extremities begin to numb, a wave of panic washes over me, threatening to engulf my entire being.

The howling wind screams in my ears, causing me to cover them with the woolen warmth of my mittens. The snow falls heavily, blurring my vision and making it impossible to see more than a few feet in front of me. I wrap my scarf tighter around my face, the cold seeping into the gaps where the fabric skips over my skin.

I press on, my legs aching from the struggle against the powerful gusts of wind. The snow beneath my boots is thick and unwieldy, threatening to slip out from under me with every step. I can feel the icy fingers of the mountain clawing at my clothes, desperate to claim me as its own.

Suddenly, my foot finds only air where there should be solid ground. I lose my balance, my arms flailing wildly as I try to regain my footing. But it's too late. I feel myself falling through the void, the wind rushing past me in a loud whistle.

I hit the ground hard, the impact jolting the air from my lungs. I lay there, dazed and disoriented, the world around me a blur of white and gray. I try to move, but my body feels heavy, weighed down by the layers of snow and ice that have accumulated on me during my fall.

I know I have to keep moving if I'm going to survive, but every part of me screams in protest at the thought of once again braving the harsh elements. I close my eyes, allowing myself a moment of rest, a moment of respite from the brutal onslaught of the storm.

But it's a moment that proves too long. I feel consciousness slipping away, my breathing slowing as the cold seeps into my very core. I try to fight it, to summon the strength to carry on, but it's a losing battle. The blizzard closes around me, a cocoon of white that swallows me whole, and I tumble into a deep, dark sleep.

Only in my dreams will I find peace.
