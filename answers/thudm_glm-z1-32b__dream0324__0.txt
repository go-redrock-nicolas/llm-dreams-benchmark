I am dreaming. I am floating in a sea of stars that shimmer like liquid mercury. My body is light, yet I feel the weight of a thousand forgotten memories pressing against my chest. The stars swirl around me, forming shapes—faces of loved ones I’ve never met, cities that never were, a clock that ticks in reverse. As I drift, a voice whispers, "You are the bridge between what was and what will be." The stars split, revealing a path of light that leads to a door carved from rain. I reach out, but the door melts into a thousand raindrops that form a single tear on my cheek. When I wake, my pillow is damp, and the sunlight feels warmer than usual, as if the dream has left behind a trace of its own light.
You awaken from a nightmare, the air thick with the scent of burnt parchment and distant thunder, though the sky outside is clear. Your hands tremble as you clutch the edges of your sheets, which feel suddenly coarse against your skin. The nightmare lingers—not as a vague unease but as a palpable presence, like a shadow that shadows, a cold breath on the back of your neck even as you sit upright. 

The residual fear is not just in your mind. It’s a physical echo: your pulse drums in your temples, your breath comes too fast, the taste of metal lingers on your tongue. You glance at the clock—3:27 AM—but the numbers blur at the edges. You know you must process this, but how? You try to shake it off, but the dream clings like wet seaweed, refusing to be brushed away. 

You stumble to the kitchen, your socked feet silent on the hardwood. The fridge hums, and the fluorescent light flickers, casting jagged shadows on the walls. You peel open a carton of eggs, crack one into a pan, and listen to the sizzle sound like a thousand paper cuts. The yolk spills over, golden and perfect, but you can’t stop thinking about the face from the dream—a woman with eyes like cracked obsidian, her mouth stretched into a rictus, her hands covered in veins that pulse like separate beings. 

You eat the eggs in silence, and when you’re done, you dump the carton into the trash. The eggs crumble like old bark. You wash your plate, and the water feels icy, even though the tap is barely cold. The sink drains, and for a moment, you half-expect a hand to shoot up, grasp the plug, and refuse to let go. 

You turn off the light, and the room is pitch black for a long second before the fridge hum returns, a steady heartbeat. In the dark, you see the woman again, her nails scraping against the glass, her breath fogging the window. You reach out to touch the window, but your finger goes through it, leaving no mark. You wake up from this realization, and the dream dissolves, but the tightness in your chest remains. 

You spend the day walking, as if motion might shake loose the remnants of the dream. You pass a park where children are laughing, their voices too bright. You watch a squirrel scamper up a tree, and for a second, you see the woman’s face in its fur. You try to laugh, but the sound is a croak. 

At night, you lie awake, listening to the house creak. The night sky is a vast, empty sheet, and you wonder if the dream was a warning, a visitation, a message from a place beyond the stars. You think of the woman again, her hands, her eyes, and you feel a deep, irrational urge to apologize—to what, to whom, you don’t know. 

You close your eyes, and for a moment, you almost let yourself sleep, but you pull back, convinced that the dream will return, stronger, more vivid, more real. You stay awake, watching the shadows play on the walls, until dawn breaks, a thin blue line across the horizon. The sunlight feels like a promise, but you’re not sure you can trust it. 

You get up, shower, and dress. As you leave the house, you glance back at the window where the woman might have been, but there’s nothing there. You walk to work, the air crisp with dew, and for the first time all day, you feel a flicker of hope—a tiny ember, but it’s there.
