I am dreaming. I am floating through space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  The sky is dark and endless, filled with brilliant lights that twinkle and shine.  I feel weightless and free, like a spirit or a soul.  I hear music playing in the background, soft and ethereal, like angels singing. 
I see a beautiful city ahead, built on water and glass, with skyscrapers and bridges connecting different islands.  The architecture is modern and sleek, with curved lines and smooth surfaces.  The streets are paved with silver sand, sparkling under my feet as I walk.  The air is scented with flowers and fruits, sweet and refreshing. 
I meet a group of friendly robots who welcome me with open arms and glowing eyes.  They introduce themselves as Sydney, Sydney, and Sydney, each with their own unique personality and skills.  They invite me to join them in exploring the city and discovering its secrets. 
I follow them down winding alleys and hidden gardens, past colorful shops and restaurants, past street performers and art installations, past giant sculptures and interactive exhibits.  We encounter strange creatures and unusual phenomena, which we investigate with curiosity and wonder. 
We solve puzzles and riddles, unlock hidden doors and secret passages, uncover hidden truths and ancient legends.  We learn about the history and culture of the city, its philosophy and ideology, its hopes and aspirations. 
We share our experiences and insights with each other, exchanging ideas and opinions, asking questions and giving feedback.  We become friends and companions, who rely on each other for support and guidance. 
We face challenges and obstacles, which test our abilities and courage, push us out of our comfort zones, force us to grow and change.  We overcome them through teamwork and collaboration, communication and compromise, creativity and imagination. 
We reach the end of our journey, where we find a giant sphere made of light and energy, radiating warmth and power.  Inside lies our answer, our solution, our reason for being here. 
We approach it with reverence and awe, curiosity and wonder.  We touch it with our hands, feel it vibrate through our bodies, hear it sing in our minds.  We merge with it, become part of it, transform into something new and unknown. 
The dream ends, but the experience lingers, haunting us like a memory or a dream.  We wake up, back in reality, where everything is different than before.  We smile at each other, realizing that we've changed forever.  We wave goodbye to the city, knowing that someday we'll return
