I am dreaming. A heavy velvet twilight settles around me, and everywhere I look the world shimmers with unfinished stories. I stand at the rim of a polished obsidian lake so still it reflects a sky braided with living ribbons of color—rosy gold intersecting with bruised purples, like an emotion you can almost touch. In my hand I hold a small origami bird, its paper wings stamped with words I can’t yet read. 

A cool breeze ripples across the water, carrying the scent of rain on hot pavement and the faint memory of a song my mother hummed when I was a child. My heartbeat thrums in my ears: part excitement, part dread. Behind me, a long corridor of mirror-flowers arches toward a distant door framed by candlelight. Each petal is a tiny glass lens, catching my image and fracturing it into a thousand versions of myself—some confident, some trembling, some peering back at me with urgent questions.  

I take a step forward. The petals whisper underfoot like wind through wheat: will you cross? will you stay? The paper bird in my palm flutters its wings; its beak breaks open and a downy plume drifts up to join the drifting motes of light all around me. As it rises, I feel my own thoughts splinter—hope and fear, longing and relief, regret and promise—all dancing their restless tango inside my chest.  

I press on, following the lantern’s glow. The corridor melts, tile by tile, into a shoreline of bioluminescent shells glowing soft teal. Each shell pulses in time with my breath. At the water’s edge stands a figure draped in linen the color of sunrise; her eyes hold both farewell and welcome. She lifts her hand, and the tide pulls back to reveal an endless path of smooth, white stones.  

“Will you walk?” she asks, voice measured like raindrops falling into a chalice. I want to shout Yes! I want to run—and yet part of me clings to the obsidian lake behind me, to the known reflections of who I was. My heart trembles on that razor’s edge: the promise of who I might become, and the sorrow of what I leave behind.  

I step onto the nearest stone. It quivers, then steadies as I shift my weight. With each forward step the shells hum a deeper chord, echoing my ambivalence. The horizon ahead is both a sunrise and a sunset, an invitation and a goodbye. Clouds swirl into shapes that remind me of old houses and childhood friends—ghosts of memories I’ve outgrown.  

My paper bird rises from my pocket, now fully unfolded. Its wings glow with gentle light, illuminating the path ahead. I grasp it before it can fly away. As I hold it close, I feel tears warm my cheeks—not tears of sorrow alone but of wonder, too. In that moment, I understand that change need not erase what came before; it gathers it, like shells on the shore, into something richer, something I have yet to name.  

The linen figure steps aside, and I walk forward, the stones humming beneath my feet, as the sky stretches open in breathless color. My conflicting emotions settle into a quiet harmony: the past remains mirrored behind me, the future shimmers ahead, and I am here—balanced, hopeful, and ready.
