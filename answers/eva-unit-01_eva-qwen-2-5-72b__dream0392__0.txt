I am dreaming. The dream begins in a vibrant, lush forest with towering trees, their leaves swaying gently in the warm breeze. The air is filled with a nostalgic, sweet scent that triggers a cascade of forgotten memories.

As I walk deeper into the forest, the trees begin to change, becoming shorter and more abstract in form. This transition feels strangely comfortable, and I continue traversing the strange landscape. Suddenly, I'm standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering lake, reflecting a startlingly clear, star-filled sky. The stars appear unusually large and seem to be pulsating like distant heartbeats.

The vastness of the lake gives me a strange feeling of awe and humility, and the dream fades as I gaze into this celestial reflection. Upon waking, I write this dream down and observe the parallels to my current life situation. As I ponder over the meaning of the dream, I realize that perhaps the stars represent those who have played a vital role in my life journey, guiding and illuminating my path.
