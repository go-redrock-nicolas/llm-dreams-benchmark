I am dreaming. You’re standing alone at the threshold of a vast arena carved into a mountain’s white marble flanks. The sky above you pulses with molten gold and violet, as though dawn and dusk have collided in a cosmic dance.  A hush ripples through the air, but it isn’t emptiness—it’s the suspense of ten thousand silent hearts beating in unison. Your breath steams in front of you like a dragon’s plume, each exhalation echoing through the vast coliseum like a summons.

As you lace your boots, you feel the warm thrum of ancient engines buried beneath the battleground—huge mechanical stewards of this contest, their bronze girders humming in time with your pulse. The grass beneath your feet is impossibly green and springs upward in threads of living emerald, softly caressing your ankles. Far off, the roars of the crowd are not mere sound but waves of color, streaking overhead in fiery reds, electric blues, and shimmering silvers.

You raise your head, and the gates at the far end of the field part like the pages of a storybook. Through that arch strides your opponent: a towering figure wreathed in drifting mist, eyes glowing like twin lanterns sunk deep in obsidian hollows. Around them, the very air shimmers, as though reality itself hesitates before their presence. But within you, a fierce spark ignites—undimmed confidence born of every trial you endured to arrive here.

The sun—giant and molten—slants low, forging long, dramatic shadows that stretch toward the center of the field. At that moment, the arena transforms: the grass ripples into liquid mirror, reflecting the kaleidoscope sky and amplifying every heartbeat. The mountainside walls ripple and become transparent; you glimpse distant galaxies swirling just beyond the horizon. In the hush, you sense the boundaries between dream and waking life melting away.

You step forward: each footfall leaves a trail of stardust that shimmers and dissolves. Your heart resonates with the arena’s hum, and you can almost hear it speaking to you in a wordless language: “This moment is yours.” Your hands tighten on the hilt of your weapon—an ornate staff hewn from meteorite iron, black as midnight and veined with liquid sapphire. It thrums with latent power, eager to be awakened by your command.

Across the field, your opponent raises their own blade of silvery moonlight, and in that instant, the world holds its breath. A single, crystalline note rings out, like a tuning fork struck at the dawn of time. Then everything surges into motion: the grass-surface ripples into waves, the sky’s gold and violet hues whirl like a living canvas, and the mountainside walls pulse with ancient runes that flare in response to your courage.

Your first strike arcs through the surreal light, leaving trails of comet-fire in its wake. Time slows, and you feel the collision of wills—not just yours, but the legacy of every battle you ever fought, every ounce of sweat and every moment you refused to yield. The dream stretches, expands, and in that boundless space you know: no matter the outcome, this moment is already immortal. It is the apex of your ambition, crafted by every step you took to reach this peak.

And then, as rapidly as it bloomed, the scene shatters like glass under a comet’s touch. You find yourself bathed in pale moonlight, standing on the edge of a silent field. The challenger’s specter fades into starlight, the audience dissolves into a thousand glittering motes, and only your own heartbeat remains, loud in the hush. You exhale—and the dream fades, but its fire burns on, a lantern in your spirit, guiding you still toward that impossible, incandescent summit.
