I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself in a vibrant and bustling city, but I feel an overwhelming sense of isolation. The streets are filled with people, but I can't seem to connect with anyone. Everyone seems to be in their own world, lost in their phones or engrossed in conversations that don't include me. 

As I walk through the crowded streets, I stumble upon a secluded alleyway. Intrigued, I decide to explore it. The alleyway is dimly lit, with old brick walls on either side. The further I go, the more the noise of the city fades away, replaced by a calm serenity. 

At the end of the alley, I discover a hidden garden. It's the most beautiful garden I've ever seen - full of colorful flowers, singing birds, and a gently flowing stream. But it's also deserted. No one else seems to know about this place of tranquility. 

Suddenly, a small, glowing frog hops onto my finger. It speaks to me in a language only I can understand. The frog tells me that this garden is a reflection of my own heart - a place of beauty and solitude, where I can find peace and rediscover myself. 

I wake up from my dream, feeling a newfound sense of purpose. I know that I must embrace the solitude in my life and use it to find my inner garden - a place of peace and self-discovery. And just like the hidden garden in my dream, I vow to keep my inner garden a secret place, known only to myself.
