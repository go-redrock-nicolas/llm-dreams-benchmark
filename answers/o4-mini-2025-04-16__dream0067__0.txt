I am dreaming. You are floating in a cathedral of glass and moonlight. The walls ripple like oil on water, each wave carrying whispered fragments of songs you once loved. In the center of this hall stands a tall, slender figure in a lab coat spun from starlight. They hand you a scroll of translucent blue silk. When you unroll it, letters of pure silver climb across its surface: a name, a number—months.  

Shock washes over you like a sudden gale. Your heart thrums so loudly in your chest it shatters the echoing quiet. The moon-water on the walls roils and bursts into shooting stars, hurling themselves around you as if you’ve become their impossible anchor. You clutch the scroll and feel its chill seep into your bones.  

Yet even as panic claws at your throat, the glass cathedral begins to dissolve. You drift out into a field of amber reeds taller than oaks, their feathery plumes singing in winds you cannot see. Each blade glows at the tip with bioluminescent fireflies—tiny lanterns of promise. You realize you can touch them without harm. One perches on your fingertip, warmth blossoming beneath its wings.  

A breeze carries the scent of distant rain on sunbaked earth, and before you stands a river made of molten light. You step in, toes wading through liquid gold that pulses with every heartbeat. Downstream, the water branches off into countless tributaries, each promising a different life: one leads to childhood laughter in dusty backyards; another to first love under a orange-pink sky; yet another to quiet autumn evenings by a crackling hearth.  

You watch each path shimmer, then feel the silver letters on your skin gently burning away, replaced by fine tracings of starlight—tiny constellations mapping out your days. The diagnosis was real, but here in this dream, you’re free to explore how you might fill the time you have left. Each tributary calls. Which story will you step into?  

At the river’s edge, you kneel and cup light in your hands. It pulses softly, reminding you that even in the briefest life, moments of blazing color are yours to claim. Your tears ignite with prismatic sparks as you rise, turning your gaze to the horizon where sky and water merge in a liquid mirror.  

And then—just as the first star pulses with your name—you wake. The echo of lantern-reeds still hums in your ears, the taste of molten gold on your tongue. You open your eyes to your quiet room, the morning light spilling across the bed. You breathe deeply, carrying with you the dream’s lingering gift: the startling beauty of fragile moments, the knowledge that even a handful of precious days can be as infinite as a cathedral of moonlight.
