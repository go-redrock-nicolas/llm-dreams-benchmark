I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and the distant hum of a city I no longer recognize. The sky is painted in a gradient of violets and ambers, swirling like watercolor, suggesting an approaching twilight that never comes. I stand on the edge of a bridge that arcs high above a river of liquid obsidian. Its surface mirrors not my reflection but scenes from my past—events I thought long buried, now shimmering with altered hues.

My grandmother’s hands, once rough from years of kneading dough, now move with the grace of a painter’s, molding bread into shapes I never knew existed: crescent moons and spiraling galaxies. She sings a lullaby I’ve never heard before, her voice trembling with secrets. The bakery where I grew up, always drab and stuffy, now glows with a honeyed light, its walls lined with jars of forgotten flavors—saffron-honey, burnt orange, starlight—each bottle breathing with its own tiny universe.

A figure approaches—the me of five years ago, wide-eyed and clutching a half-drawn picture of our family. My younger self stops, studies my face, and asks why I’m crying. I open my throat to answer but only whisper static, the words dissolving into the wind. The younger me frowns, turns, and walks away into a thicket of thornless black roses. The petals brush against my legs as I chase, but the blossoms close behind, sealing off the path.

The bridge shudders. The obsidian river below now reflects not the past but fragments of futures never chosen: a life in a glass tower full of murmuring drones, a voyage across deserts on the back of a mechanical camel, a life spent painting murals in the ruins of cities submerged underwater. Each vignette flutters like a moth’s wing before fading into the ink-black river.
