I am dreaming. The air around me is thick with the golden haze of late afternoon sunlight filtering through sheer curtains, casting everything in a warm, dreamlike glow. I stand in a room I don’t recognize, yet it feels familiar—perhaps a forgotten corner of my subconscious, lined with soft, worn furniture and shelves cluttered with trinkets and books whose titles blur when I try to read them.  

Then I see *them*. A figure sitting by the window, curled slightly inward, as if trying to make themselves smaller. Their shoulders tremble almost imperceptibly, and when they lift their head, their eyes are glassy with unshed tears. The sight pierces me—not with sadness, but with an overwhelming sense of intimacy, as if I’ve been granted permission to witness something profoundly private.  

I don’t hesitate. My feet carry me forward, the hardwood floor cool beneath my bare soles. I sit beside them, close but not touching, giving them space to decide if they want to bridge the gap. The air between us hums with unspoken words, heavy and electric.  

After a moment, they exhale—a shaky, surrendering sound—and lean into me. Their warmth seeps into my side, and I wrap an arm around them, feeling the weight of their head settle against my shoulder. The scent of salt and something faintly floral—like crushed petals—lingers in the air.  

No words pass between us. None are needed. In this golden, suspended moment, we exist beyond language, beyond time. The vulnerability between us isn’t fragile; it’s *alive*, pulsing like a second heartbeat. I press my cheek against their hair, and the dream itself seems to sigh, wrapping us both in its embrace.  

When I wake, the feeling lingers—a ghost of connection, tender and bittersweet, like the last note of a song you wish would never end.
