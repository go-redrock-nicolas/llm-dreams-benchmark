I am dreaming. I dream of a labyrinthine library where the walls are alive with murmuring stories. Each book is a pulsing organ, breathing in time with my heartbeat. The shelves stretch like endless ribs, and the air smells of ancient ink and possibility.  Suddenly, I feel a presence. A figure made of shadow and starlight steps forward.  "This is the Crossroads of Chronicles," they say.  "To proceed, you must choose: Save the library from collapsing into silence forever... or preserve the last untouched story, whispered only to those pure of heart.  The choice is yours, dreamer."
