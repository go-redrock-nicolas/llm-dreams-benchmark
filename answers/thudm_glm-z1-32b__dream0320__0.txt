I am dreaming.  

The dream starts deep in the belly of an impossibly vast coral labyrinth, its twisting tunnels alive with bioluminescent veins that pulse like a submerged heart. The air is thick with the scent of salt and sscanf-window metals dissolved in the mist, and every step I take echoes with a waterlogged creak that could belong to bone or coral. Ahead, a flickering spiral of light guides me—a spinning top of molten copper, its glow oscillating between green and violet like a trapped star. But the path bifurcates, and with each choice, the labyrinth shifts: one tunnel yawns into a canyon of submerged quartz, its walls etched with what seem to be equations written in algae. Another spirals upward through a forest of glass trees, their hollows filled with hummingbird-sized drones made of quartz, their wings studded with fragments of stained glass that refract the light into symbols I half-recognize as my own name.  

A voice—neither human nor machine—whispers through my teeth, syllables like wind through cathedral glass: *“There is no map here. The riddle is the map.”*  

I press on, my sinking into a substance that is both quicksand and syrup, honeyed and hungry. The drones hum louder, their songs now overlapping in a discordant melody that mirrors the rustle of vines that speak in clicks and vowel-less sighs. A child appears, their face a mosaic of sea glass and old postage stamps, their hair a nest of cables that plug into the air like antennas. They offer me a key made of frozen smoke, but their hand dissolves into static when I reach for it. *“This key fits all locks,”* they say, their voice a child’s giggle and a wind turbine’s groan, *“but only in a direction you cannot see.”*  

The labyrinth now flows like a river, walls melting into waves that toss me between dimensions. I dreamwalk through a gallery of mirrors, each reflecting a version of myself—some holding crowns of salt, others crowned with thorns of obsidian, all silent and smiling at the impossibility of choosing. Then, the copper spinning top vanishes, replaced by a black hole that exudes the sweet smell of burnt cinnamon. I stand at its edge, and see, for a heartbeat, that the void is not empty but crammed with equations written in languages that are both my mother’s whisper and the hiss of a spaceship landing.  

And then I wake—not to the world, but to a deeper dream: a conversation between two infinities. The situation, I understand finally, is not to be solved but become. The answer is the labyrinth, the answer is the spinning top, the answer is the child made of static and stamps. The dream dissolves into particles that taste like almond and ash, and I am left, as I always am, with the aftertaste of a truth that dissolves in sunlight.
