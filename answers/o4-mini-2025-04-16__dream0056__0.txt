I am dreaming. Cold mist coils around my ankles as I stand at the edge of an ancient forest the color of twilight. A dozen faces peer at me—strangers all—each clutching a battered rucksack and eyes wide with equal parts hope and fear. Despite having no previous experience, I feel a strange surge of confidence pulsing through my veins, as though some hidden part of me knows the way.

The first step into the woods is like slipping through a veil. Mossy trunks loom overhead, their bark patterned with glowing runes that pulse in time with my heartbeat. Every leaf shimmers in shades of violet and gold. When I reach out to brush one between my fingers, it dissolves into silver dust that drifts upward and scatters into constellations among the boughs. Behind me, the group hushes in awe; I turn, nod, and begin to lead.

We follow a ribbon of pale quartz pebbles that winds deeper into this living cathedral. Underfoot, the path hums—a low, melodic resonance that seems to whisper warnings in a language I almost understand. With each step, the forest shifts: trees twist into spiral spires, rivers of liquid moonlight swirl across our trail, and phosphorescent insects rise in clouds, illuminating hidden carvings on cavern walls.

My heart pounds as we emerge onto a high plateau overlooking a vast valley carved by time itself. Jagged monoliths stand like silent sentinels along its rim, each crowned by a floating island, drifting slowly as though borne upon a gentle wind. Below, a river of lavender mist cuts through the valley floor, and at its center stands a colossal tree with roots that cradle an obsidian doorway. From within, a deep, echoing hum beckons us onward.

I feel the strangers gather close, trusting my unspoken promise to guide them. I raise my hand and point toward the doorway, aware now that I’m not stumbling blindly—this dream has chosen me as its guide. As our feet touch the smooth stone steps spiraling down from the plateau, the runes on the trees flare in brilliant sapphire. A distant horn sounds once, a single note that vibrates through every fiber of my being.

With each descending step, visions flicker at the edges of my vision: memories I’ve never lived, laughter of children under a coral sky, the whisper of a beloved voice calling my name. The group pauses, fear and wonder warring in their eyes. I close mine, breathe deeply, and step forward again. The ground beneath my boot feels warm, as if the very heart of the world pulses there.

At last we reach the obsidian doorway. It swings open without a sound, revealing a chamber of liquid light. Stars drift across its ceiling, meteors flickering in slow motion, and at its center stands a fountain of pure crystal, dripping droplets that turn to butterflies the moment they touch the floor. The strangers gasp, and I realize that this is why we came: to bathe in this impossible light, to be reborn with the courage we never knew we possessed.

I lift my hand and beckon them in. As we step across the threshold, the butterflies rise in a riot of color and carry our collective hopes into the sky. The dream pulses around us, and I understand with startling clarity that every uncertain step I’ve taken has led us here. In this place of radiant wonder, we are no longer strangers, no longer inexperienced—we are pioneers in a landscape born of pure imagination.

I wake before the last butterfly can vanish. Sunlight spills across my ceiling, but the echo of that silent horn still hums in my chest, and I know I carry this dream—this impossible journey—with me, somewhere deep inside.
