I am dreaming.

I’m walking through a forest where the trees pulse with gently glowing veins of sapphire and violet. The air is sweet with the scent of oranges and distant rain, and the ground hums beneath my every step—a heartbeat from the roots below. 

Suddenly, a messenger bird—its feathers iridescent, shifting through every hue of sorrow—lands on my shoulder and whispers the devastating news. It tugs at my heart, a cold ache echoing through my bones. For a moment, the world blurs: the sky darkens, the trees’ light flickers with uncertainty, and the rain begins to fall in slow, drifting globes. Each droplet reflects my sorrow.

But I do not turn away. I pause in the gloom, plant my feet on the trembling earth, and draw a breath so deep it feels as though I am pulling the stars down into my lungs. My exhale is slow—a gentle breeze that stirs the luminescent ferns back to life.

Around me, the rain evolves, sparkling like crystal tears suspended in air. Each droplet, instead of falling, rises and floats, gathering in shapes of memories and hopes. The trees’ colors strengthen, ignited by the fire of endurance within my chest.

I reach out and let the shimmering rain ribbon through my fingers. I don’t break down—I bend, like a willow in the storm, learning the language of resilience from every glowing leaf and drifting sphere. The devastating news becomes a black stone, and I cast it into a pool of silver light, watching the ripples carry it far away.

Onward, I walk, into a deeper part of the dream-forest, the air crackling now not with despair, but with possibility—as if my very breath has rewritten the world around me.
