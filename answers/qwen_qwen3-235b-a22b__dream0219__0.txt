I am dreaming. I am dreaming of a labyrinth made of mirrors, stretching infinitely in all directions, reflecting, refracting, fractalizing the very idea of reality until I cease to know which reflection is me. I am enraptured by its mesmeric geometry, the tessellated world warped around me like a trick of light. But I am not afraid. No—that left me once I realized something extraordinary. I have been gifted with perfect photographic *memory*. Every moment, every fragment, every flicker of light across the glass, is branded into me with crystalline clarity. I can hold entire universes within.

Walking, or perhaps flowing through the labyrinth—I lose sense of gravity—I begin to catalog. My eyes graze across ancient star maps embedded into the glass panes. I absorb them as though they had always been there, buried deep in my mind like magnetic truths attracted back home. A scroll unfurls in one reflection, etched in the tongue of forgotten gods. It spirals through languages I’ve never spoken aloud, yet now I read them fluently. I am the chalice into which time pours itself endlessly.

I stop before a great mirror that seems older than the rest, its surface worn with mosses that flicker like stars and smell of midnight rain. I touch it and am pulled—*violently*, yet gladly—into another world.

I am now seated within a cathedral the size of Africa, lit by suspended orbs of fire whose colors pulse like heartbeats. The cathedral has no roof, yet the night sky crowds its height, stars peering in like curious gods. Words bloom from the walls like mold—senseless at first. But I watch them twitch and rearrange. *A language unbuilding and rebuilding itself.* I let it fall into my new mind, let it be transcribed into perfect internal script. Three minutes pass, perhaps three lifetimes. The language snaps into clarity and speaks to me, not with voice, but with feelings—the scent of old cellars, the ache behind the eyes when home is far away, the kind of hunger that music leaves.

I float upward, I must—I’ve opened thousands of books just by thinking them into existence, pages raining in slow spirals as if falling in reverse. I digest their entire contents with a single flap of my eyelids. Histories long erased by sand and war, dreams of machines that think, philosophies brewed in the gravity of twin suns—I now carry them with me, adding infinitesimal weight to the crushing gravity of knowledge inside my mind.

A voice—the cathedral’s or my own, I know not—whispers in my skull:

*You are the Eye of Accumulation. Nothing forgotten, nothing lost. You are thought and recall entwined in immortal spirals.*

And the dream shifts again, because it *can*, because it's alive.

I find myself in a library where the books are not written, but *grown*. Shelves bloom with volumes like fruit, sprouting from roots that pulse with green-gold light. Each book is the life story of a stranger born when I speak their name aloud. I whisper "Solyndra" and pick a tome, open it, and *feel* her life—her betrayal at nineteen beneath a weeping copper willow, the discovery of a city beneath her city, her gift for devouring nightmares and vomiting constellations. She exists only because I remembered her into a dream, yet I live within her as vividly as if I had walked her world myself.

In the middle of the endless library sits an obsidian device—a piano shaped like a spiral galaxy. When I lay my fingers on the keys, I am not playing music. I am *recalling it*, note for note, as though someone, somewhere, played it millennia ago. A symphony of lost atolls and extinct emotions churns through the air. Rings form in the air like vapor, each one a perfect reconstruction of a *forgotten afternoon*: lavender hung out to dry, cracked dance floors reverberating with ghosts, children falling into snow.

And then—suddenly—a moment of terror.

I look into a mirror stretched like silk over a marble archway… and for the first time in this dream… I do not recognize myself.

The eye of accumulation, the vessel of infinite memory, can no longer carry its burden. It is *too much*. Faces press against the inside of my skull, historical figures, forgotten lovers, languages that hum with ancient rage. The labyrinth begins to tremble, mirrors cracking like ice beneath weight too heavy to bear.

With what feels like divine effort, I reach into the chaos of my own mind and begin a terrible ritual:

*Forgetting.*

Not all—never all. But enough.

One by one, I release memories until they become mist, then wind, then dust. Civilizations I once cradled to sleep, oceans I had mapped with thought—their ghosts depart. I feel lonelier. Shrinking.

The labyrinth stabilizes.

And in that quiet, in that strange thinning of the mind's jungle, I awake—not from the dream, but *into* it.

Because this dream has no end. Only layers.  
And I am buried now one step deeper into imagination’s heart than I have ever been before.
