I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with electric anticipation as you step into a coliseum carved from obsidian and starlight. The arena pulses like a living thing—its walls shift between bioluminescent forests and deserts of floating glass, each landscape dissolving into the next like a feverish hallucination. Thousands of spectators hover weightlessly in the void above, their faces glowing with constellations. At the center of it all, a towering archway shimmers into existence, etched with runes that burn like supernovas. A voice thunders, not heard but felt in your bones: *"To claim your dream, you must first become the dream."*  

The first challenge begins.  

The ground beneath you ripples, transforming into a labyrinth of liquid mercury. Floating within it are fragments of forgotten memories—a child’s laughter, a half-remembered melody, the scent of rain on asphalt. To navigate, you must *sing* the labyrinth’s language. Your voice falters at first, but as you hum, the mercury hardens into bridges of crystalline sound. Each note you strike reshapes the maze, revealing paths that twist like Möbius strips. You stumble upon a shadowy figure—a fellow competitor—trapped in a loop of their own fear. You offer your hand, and your combined voices harmonize, shattering the illusion. The labyrinth dissolves, leaving your palms etched with constellations.  

The second trial is a mirror maze, but the reflections are not yours. Each pane reveals a life you could have lived: a warrior queen astride a stormcloud, a poet scribbling verses in a language of fire, a thief who steals time itself. The challenge? Choose none, yet embrace all. You press your forehead to a mirror, and the boundaries blur. You feel the weight of every unlived life flood your veins—the warrior’s rage, the poet’s ache, the thief’s restless hunger. When you pull away, your skin shimmers with iridescent scales, your hair weaves itself into smoke. You are *more* now, a mosaic of possibilities.  

The final challenge is a banquet.  

A table stretches into infinity, laden with dishes that bleed starlight and whisper secrets. Each course represents a sacrifice: a memory, a fear, a longing. To win, you must eat them all. The first bite of *forgotten joy* tastes like summer lightning; the second, *buried grief*, floods your throat with saltwater. You choke down *envy* (burning like chili seeds), *regret* (a gelid, metallic sludge), and *loneliness* (a honeyed nectar that rots your teeth). When you finish, your ribs crack open like blossoms, revealing a core of molten gold. The judges—a council of faceless beings whose voices are the hum of tectonic plates—lean forward.  

*"What will you create with what you’ve consumed?"*  

You open your mouth and exhale a phoenix.  

It’s feathers are woven from your laughter and failures, its wingspan blotting out the arena. It scorches away the last vestiges of doubt, leaving only the raw, pulsing truth of your hunger. The archway blazes anew, its runes resolving into a single word: **YES**.  

You wake at your desk, the scent of burnt ozone lingering on your skin. A letter waits—crimson wax stamped with a sigil you’ve never seen, yet somehow know. The words inside shimmer:  

*"Your dream job has been waiting. It begins at dawn. Bring the phoenix."*  

And outside, the horizon cracks open, spilling light like blood.
