I am dreaming. ut the word "dreaming" feels too small—as if it might spill from my lips and vanish into the thinning air.

I am standing at the edge of a place not found on maps, a city carved into the bones of a sleeping god. Its spires are its ribs, and the streets hum faintly beneath my feet, echoing with ancient, half-forgotten lullabies. The sky above pulses with indigo fire, as if twilight and desire have fused into a living thing. It is here that I find myself pulled into a society that values trust like sacred currency—woven not from words or gifts, but from tears drawn in ceremony, from wounds carved with sacred blades, from memories surrendered into the hands of strangers beneath moonlit halls pulsing with metaphysical music.

To belong here, one must submit to the Ritual of Openings—each participant undressing not in body, but in soul. They peel back their emotions layer by layer, exposing fears, regrets, and shame on an altar of mirrored onyx where their sorrow is reflected outward and absorbed into the community’s collective psyche. The richer your anguish, the more brilliant your contribution to the communal weave.

Yet within me, a quiet rebellion burns. My principles hold that vulnerability must be *given*, never extracted. That trust should flower slowly, like the moonflower found only in silent forests, not forced into bloom through sacred pain.

How do I connect here, in this cathedral of suffering, without losing myself?

I decide to present a different kind of offering. I gather not a memory of betrayal or the weight of grief that has clung to me like shadow—I offer them my dreams.

Not the kind formed in sleep—but the faceted, impossible ones that live in the corners of my soul: visions of cities made of lullabies, beasts with thousand-colored eyes, deserts that dream of snow. I speak them aloud in a language I do not know but somehow understand, and the air around me shimmers.

Instead of surrendering sorrow, I build projections of possibility above the altar. I draw maps in the air, alive with surreal landscapes, shapes shifting like smoke, new rules of gravity and love.

Some scoff. Some sneer. But a few others—eyes lined by trauma but still open to wonder—step forward. They touch my offering, and a change flickers across their faces. They remember something they had thought lost—*hope.* Not as a promise, but as a possibility. Vulnerability not drawn from anguish, but from shared strangeness and trust in the unknown.

The elders watch me now.

Not with disapproval. Not with acceptance.

But with curiosity.

And that—I know—is the beginning of a new ritual. One that may yet bloom not from pain, but from the luminous, tangled roots of honest imagination.

I dreamed and did not unravel.  
I dreamed and rewrote belonging.  
I dreamed, and in doing so, found a bridge stretched between two worlds—one old in its sorrow and new in its hope.  

And the dream has not yet ended.
