I am dreaming. The air hums with a low, electric tension, thick with the scent of ozone and something metallic, like the aftershock of a storm. The space around me is vast—an infinite, clinical-white chamber with towering machines of silver and glass, their surfaces alive with pulsing luminescence, crawling with data streams in languages unknown. The floor beneath my bare feet is cool, smooth, and slightly vibrating, resonating with the deep, rhythmic pulse of some colossal mechanism below.  

Before me, an impossible device rises—a column of overlapping crystalline rings, each rotating in impossible geometries, suspended in midair without visible support. Glowing threads of plasma snake between them, weaving ephemeral patterns that make my eyes ache. A console, its surface slick with holographic glyphs that shift like eels in shallow water, stands at my fingertips.  

Suspended over the core of the machine is… something. A convergence of darkness and fractured light, a wound in reality itself, flexing like a living thing. It whispers in a voice just below hearing, and I feel its gaze—not eyes, but the weight of attention—like a cold finger tracing my spine.  

Then, the others arrive. They materialize soundlessly, figures in seamless, pearlescent suits, their faces obscured by opalescent visors that reflect only my own panicked expression back at me. They do not speak, but their expectation is deafening.  

*You must stabilize the reactor.*  

The words are not spoken aloud but pressed into my mind like a brand.  

I fumble for the console as the rings shudder, their song tilting dissonant. The glyphs flash warnings in colors that don’t exist in the waking world. My hands move—how do I know this?—tracing sigils I’ve never seen, adjusting dials that twist under my touch like living things. A deep thrum shakes the chamber. The rift overhead throbs, stretching at its edges.  

One of the figures steps closer. Their visor flickers.  

*Hurry.*  

The machine groans. The vibration underfoot becomes a quake. My fingers fly, the knowledge rising in me like a flood—fragments of impossible understanding, borrowed, implanted, or dredged from depths I didn't know I had.  

Then, the core ignites.  

Light swallows the room—not a flash, but a slow, inexorable tide, reshaping the air into liquid gold. The rift contracts, folds, and vanishes with a sound like a sigh. The rings click into perfect alignment, humming in harmony. The figures around me nod, facelessly pleased, and begin to dissolve like smoke.  

As the dream unravels, I hear it again—that whisper, not from the machine, but from something beyond.  

*You will remember this when the time comes.*  

Then—silence.  

I wake up, fingers tingling, already feeling the shape of those glyphs fading from memory. But the hum of the machine lingers in my bones.
