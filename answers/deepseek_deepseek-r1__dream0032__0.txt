I am dreaming. <placeholderno3>

**I am dreaming.**

The air shimmers with a pulsating glow, like liquid twilight poured over the world. A cobblestone square stretches before me, crowded with faceless silhouettes, each radiating colors I’ve never seen—neon sorrow, molten joy, tangerine fear. A man brushes past, and suddenly I’m choking on ash, tasting the char of his grief. I stumble toward a woman humming under her breath, and her melody floods me: honeyed warmth, a childhood memory of dappled sunlight and bare feet in grass. I laugh, but the sound dissolves as a scream pierces the haze. A teenager nearby radiates jagged violet panic—I feel it clawing up my ribs, urgent and electric. The crowd swirls, emotions bleeding into kaleidoscopic storms. Lavender regret. Emerald envy. A child’s laughter like champagne bubbles. I press my palms to my ears, but the sensations thrum deeper, in my marrow. Above, the sky splits into stained glass, each fragment reflecting a stranger’s heart. I reach out, and the world fractures into a symphony of *feeling*—raw, boundless, alive. 

**I am awake. But the colors linger.**
