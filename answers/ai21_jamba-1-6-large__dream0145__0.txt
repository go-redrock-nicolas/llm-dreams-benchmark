I am dreaming. You see yourself in a dimly lit room. The walls are cracked and crumbling, the air thick with dust and the faint smell of smoke. You stand at the center, surrounded by towering figures shrouded in shadow. Their presence is oppressive, and they loom over you like silent judges, waiting. You strain to see their faces, but they remain obscured, leaving you with an overwhelming sense of dread. 

A single ray of light pierces through the room from a small, high window. It illuminates a simple, unassuming box on a pedestal in front of you. The voices, faint and indistinct, rise and fall like a distant wave, urging you towards the box. But as you draw closer, your hands tremble and your heart pounds. The box feels alive, pulsating with an energy that tugs at your core, promising answers, but also warning of the cost. 

You hesitate, torn by uncertainty. The shadows close in, threatening to snuff out the last flicker of light. You reach for the box, each step heavier than the last, feeling as though you are trying to wade through deep water. Your fingers brush its surface, cold and smooth as glass, and suddenly, memories flood your mind. 

You see yourself in the countryside, oak trees surrounding you, casting dappled shadows on a gravel path. You hear the crack of a hammer and the splintering of wood as a root cellar door cracks open. A woman's scream echoes in the distance, raw and unfiltered, cutting through the silence like a knife. Then, another voice pierces the chaos—your own voice, younger, filled with fear and urgency. The images twist and churn, fading back into the shadows, replaced by something even more unsettling: a garden at night, a moonlit path, and a figure kneeling before a small patch of disturbed earth. 

You try to look closer, but the scene is fragmented, the images slipping away before you can grasp their meaning. You reach for them, desperate for clarity, but they dissolve like mist. 

The weight of the shadows lifts just enough for you to see your own face reflected in the box's surface. Your eyes are wide, your expression one of confusion and desperation. You hear a faint, familiar voice—your father’s voice—telling you to run. But where? To whom? Another memory, clearer now: a car speeding away, its headlights blinding, the smell of ash and ozone filling the air. The taste of metal in your mouth, sharp and bitter. 

And then, a hand on your shoulder. Cold and firm, like the surface of the box. It pulls you back, back into the dimly lit room where the figures wait. Their voices grow louder, rising in a crescendo that threatens to drown out all thought. You feel something shift deep within you—a realization, a single thread stretching back through time, connecting everything: the figures, the garden, the voices, the memories. 

You turn to face them, their presence no longer oppressive but familiar. They are not judges, you realize. They are witnesses, long-forgotten fragments of your past waiting to be faced. And in that moment, you understand: your dreams, your failures, they were never truly yours. You were always here, standing before the box, trying to reclaim what had been buried. 

With a deep breath, you open the box. A burst of light fills the room, so bright it blinds you, and in the light, you see not failure, but possibility. Every mistake, every setback, every moment of loss has led you to this moment, where failure transforms into understanding. 

As the light subsides, you find yourself standing in the same room, but now it is brighter, the walls repaired and whole. The figures have vanished, and in their place, you see only light. You step forward, each breath easier than the last, and you walk toward the door, unsure of what comes next but ready to face it, knowing you are no longer bound by the weight of the past. 

You step out into the garden, the world alive around you. The grass is soft beneath your feet, and the air is fresh, carrying the faint scent of rain. Ahead, there's a path you recognize, one that winds through the trees to a place where you know healing begins. You follow it, feeling lighter, each step a reminder that even in the darkest moments, you can find the strength to keep moving forward. 

And as the dream fades, you know: you will wake up changed.
