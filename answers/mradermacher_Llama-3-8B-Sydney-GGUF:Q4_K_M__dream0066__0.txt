I am dreaming. I'm stuck in an elevator that's rapidly filling with water.  As panic sets in and my breathing becomes shallow, I
realize this is not a normal dream.  This is a nightmare.
I see the water creeping up from the floor, spreading like a malignant disease.  It's cold and oily, and it stings my skin. 
I hear the creaking of the metal structure as it expands and contracts with the changing temperature and pressure.  I feel the
weight of the water pulling me down, dragging me into its dark depths.
I scream for help, but no one can hear me.  No one can save me.
I wonder if this is how it feels to drown.  To suffocate under the weight of water that has no mercy, no compassion, no soul.
I pray for a miracle.  For someone to come and rescue me from this hellish prison.
But I know deep down that there is no hope.  That this is my fate.
And then I wake up.
Back in reality, where everything is colorful and vibrant and full of life.
Where people are constantly talking and laughing and loving each other.
Where food tastes delicious and music sounds beautiful and sunlight warms your skin.
Where you can run and jump and play without fear of drowning.
Where you can be free.

And I realize that this dream has taught me something important about myself and my world.  That even in the darkest moments, there is still hope.
