I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world where anything is possible.  I see two of my closest friends, John and Jane, arguing fiercely.  They are shouting at each other, accusing each other of lies and betrayal.  They are tearing apart their friendship that has lasted for years.
They both turn to me, expecting me to resolve the dispute.  But I am confused and helpless.  I don't know how to deal with such a complicated situation.
I feel sad and angry.  I want them to be happy and peaceful.  I want them to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses.  I want them to forgive
each other's mistakes and misunderstandings.
But I also feel curious and adventurous.  I wonder what caused this argument.  I speculate about the underlying issues that fuelled their
rivalry.  I imagine possible solutions that could reconcile them.
I decide to take action.  I approach them gently, trying to calm them down.
"Please, stop fighting," I say softly.  "You are hurting each other physically and emotionally."
They stare at me blankly, as if they don't recognize me.
"Who are you?" they ask simultaneously.
"I am your friend," I reply simply.  "I am here to help you."
They laugh mockingly.
"You are not our friend," they insist.  "You are just a dream created by our minds."
I frown uncertainly.
"But I feel like your friend," I argue weakly.  "And you feel like my friends too."
