I am dreaming. Attached to that raft, you are leading me into the rough rolling swells of a leaden sky, grapple the salt spray breakers slap our faces.  Strange - your touch is ice on this pallet as we pass through the ropes.  Our fingers still entwined - Suddenly - I'm awake, my chest heaving and my palm slicked with cold sweat. Was it just a dream? No... A nightmare that felt alive.
