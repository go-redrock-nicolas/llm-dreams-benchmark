I am dreaming. I am dreaming—and the dream is vast.

I find myself standing in an amber dusk that drapes the world like liquid honey. Low clouds skate across a violet sky, reflecting the last, flaming shards of daylight. The air smells of crushed cardamom and distant rain, yet the ground beneath my bare feet is warm as embers, pulsing with a subtle heartbeat that seems to echo my own.

Ahead rises a staircase made of mirror-bright obsidian, narrow as a ribbon of spilled ink, spiraling up into nothingness. Each step hums like a tuning fork struck by invisible hands. At the summit stands my closest friend—Ara—bathed in an aureole of sun-gold light. She has just been awarded something I have chased all my waking life: a crystalline diadem that gleams with constellations. It pulses in time with the staircase, as though it is alive.

I feel the spear-point of envy pierce my chest. It is sharp, sudden, embarrassing. Why her? The diadem’s glow throws long shadows of my jealousy across the dreamscape, and I watch them crawl over the horizon like ink spilled in water.

A hush falls. I step onto the first obsidian rung. The mirror-surface shows me not my reflection but shifting vignettes of every sacrifice I have made—late nights hunched over hope, whispered promises to myself—that ended in failure. With each step, the envy gains a new texture: first a metallic taste on my tongue, then a swarm of fireflies inside my ribcage, then a stone settling in my stomach. My heartbeat grows thunderous; the staircase trembles as though my emotions have mass.

Halfway up, I hear Ara‘s voice float down, clear and kind: “Come up here. There’s room.” But her kindness cuts deeper. I want to deserve that diadem the way she does; I want validation, applause, the divine spotlight. I want it so badly that the dream’s warm wind freezes, needles of frost glittering in the air.

Suddenly the staircase fractures into two paths—one veers toward Ara, the other toward a dark cliff face veiled in storm clouds. On the cliff I glimpse a singular figure: a version of myself wearing nothing but a cloak of pale moonlight, holding a cracked mirror. His eyes are the color of remorse.

Choice pulses between my temples: reach toward my friend and confront my envy with vulnerability, or let bitterness drag me into isolation. Torn, I feel my feet divide—one on each path—until my body splits like ripples in water. One half races toward Ara; the other stumbles toward the cliff.

Dream logic compels me to inhabit both selves at once. The half approaching Ara is heavy with shame yet buoyed by a tentative hope. The diadem’s light spills onto my trembling hands, illuminating every scar of effort. Ara meets me, removes the diadem, and places it against my chest. My envy flares—red, raw—yet instantly begins melting like ice held in sunlight. I realize the diadem’s brilliance is not a zero-sum treasure; it is refracted recognition, light enough to share. The metal cools as my heartbeat steadies. I feel… lighter.

Meanwhile, the half trudging to the cliff confronts the mirror-bearing duplicate. The cracked glass shows a distorted portrait of me—eyes narrowed, lips curled, fists clenched around all the disappointments I’ve hoarded like wilted trophies. “Do you want to keep this?” the duplicate asks in a voice rough as gravel. My other half answers by releasing a silent breath. The shards of the mirror swiftly dissolve into dandelion seeds, drifting away on a sudden updraft toward the violet sky.

The two halves of me spiral back together like opposite ends of a ribbon tightening. The staircase knits itself whole once more beneath my feet, and the storm clouds peel away to reveal a midnight dome spattered with newborn stars.

Ara stands beside me—no pedestal, no distance, just a shared horizon. The diadem now floats between us, a comet paused midflight. Its light reflects equally in our eyes, and in that light I see not competition but kinship, the overlap of two quests for meaning. The envy that felt like thorns has transformed into a strange, shimmering empathy. I understand her journey, she understands mine, and the distance between us collapses.

As dawn’s first rose-gold tremor touches the sky, I notice the staircase dissolving into blossoming wisteria vines. Their lavender petals drift about our ankles like gentle applause. We breathe in unison. I feel gratitude—raw, restless, real—bloom where envy once nested.

The dream recedes like a tide, but before waking, I whisper to the violet horizon: Envy is only admiration wearing a thorny mask. Lift the mask, and both faces can smile.

The sky answers with a hush of wind, the wisteria fades, and the diadem’s starlight folds neatly into my chest—warm, weightless, waiting to glow again in daylight.
