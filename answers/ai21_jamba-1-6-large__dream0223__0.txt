I am dreaming. I am dreaming vividly today. 

In my dream, I saw myself standing in a dark field, surrounded by a thick fog that seemed to envelop me. In the distance, I could hear the faint sound of footsteps approaching, though I couldn't see anyone. I began to panic, feeling like I couldn't move, like my feet were stuck to the ground. The footsteps grew louder and closer, until I could hear the sound of heavy breathing.

Suddenly, the fog began to clear, revealing a figure in the distance. It was a woman, dressed in all black. Her voice was low and menacing, and she spoke in a language I couldn't understand. As she approached, I could see that her face was covered in dark, swirling patterns. She reached out to me, her hand glowing with a strange, eerie light. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

Just as her hand was about to touch me, the dream began to shift. I was now standing in a bright, white room, with a table in the center. On the table was a book, open to a page with strange symbols and writing. As I looked closer, I could feel myself being drawn into the book, like I was falling into the pages.

The dream then changed again, and I found myself standing in a dark forest. The trees were twisted and gnarled, and the ground was covered in thorns. There was a faint sound of whispering, and I could see a bright light in the distance. I felt a sudden urge to follow it, though I wasn't sure why.

As I walked towards the light, I could hear a voice calling my name. It was soft and soothing, but I couldn't see who was speaking. The closer I got to the light, the more it seemed to be calling to me, like it was pulling me towards it.

Finally, I reached the light. It was a small, glowing orb, floating in the air. I reached out to touch it, but as I did, the dream began to fade. The orb disappeared, and I woke up with a start.
