I am dreaming. I'm transported into an infinite library, its shelves stretching like endless corridors under a sky of swirling stars. The air hums with a low frequency, a sound that vibrates through my bones. Each book on the shelves seems to pulse faintly, their leather covers shimmering with a bioluminescent glow. I reach for one titled "Chronoecology" and, as I open it, the pages begin to flutter on their own. The ink swirls into living diagrams—geometric spirals morph into pulsating galaxies, equations unravel into constellations. A sudden realization seizes me: these books aren’t just descriptions of reality but architects of it. Their contents are alive, shaping the environment. I drop the book. It hits the shelf with a sound like a heartbeat. The ground trembles slightly. A shadow detaches itself from the nearest bookcase. It solidifies into a figure draped in flowing robes, their face obscured by a hood. "We’ve been expecting you," they say, their voice a chorus of overlapping whispers. "This place is a repository of possible worlds. The anomaly you seek isn’t an error—it’s an invitation." Before I can reply, they gesture toward a doorway appearing out of nowhere, its frame glowing like white-hot iron. "Step through, and you’ll witness a universe where causality is just another color on the spectrum of existence."
