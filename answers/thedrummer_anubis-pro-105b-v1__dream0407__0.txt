I am dreaming. It's a warm summer evening and you're involved in a tense situation with a friend, Jane, at her lavish garden party. You and Jane are destined to dance together. As the moment of the final dance approaches, the straps on Jane's shoes break. 

She begs you to remove your shoes and urges you not to think about it too deeply. It's apparent that you share a size and there's no time left to find her a new pair. You struggle to retrieve your shoes, but you eventually agree to help your long-time friend. 

As the night goes on, you bond with Jane at the party. Jane gives you the warmest of hugs and your feelings transition from friendship to something even stronger. You dance and romance under the moonlight.
