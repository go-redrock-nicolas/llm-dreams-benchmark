I am dreaming. You close your eyes and tumble headfirst into a swirl of molten indigo and silver—stars drifting like lanterns caught in a gentle gale. You’re standing on the glassy floor of a cathedral carved from midnight, its vaulted ceiling rising impossibly high. Enormous clockworks hang suspended in the air: brass gears ticking in perfect unison, each chime echoing like a slow heartbeat.  

A hush falls. From the dark aisles march hooded figures in alabaster robes, their faces hidden beneath moonlight-bright veils. They carry long wands of polished yew, tips glowing with strict blue runes—the immutable Rules. Each step they take makes the gears pause, and every pause feels like breath being held. You know their rules by heart: Never cross the threshold. Never touch the gears. Never question the Clockmaster’s decree.  

Far down the nave, behind a ruined lectern, you glimpse something moving—a small, emaciated creature with eyes like molten gold. It’s chained to the greatest gear of all, the one that measures the flow of time itself. With every tick, its ribs press harder against iron links. You feel its pain as a cold pulse behind your sternum.  

A hush ripples through the cathedral. The alabaster-robed judges turn as one and their wands flare. “You are here to maintain order,” their voices ring out, smooth and distant. “Do not interfere.”  

Your heart pounds—an urgent drum. The rules are absolute. They protect the balance of this world. But you sense that the creature’s suffering threatens a deeper harmony: compassion. You remember a fragment of an old lullaby, half-forgotten, whispering that mercy is the truest measure of time.  

The judges step forward, their runes shifting from blue to icy white, ready to strike down any who stray. You feel the crackle of forbidden magic rise in your fingertips. Your mind races: obey and watch the creature’s life slip away, or defy the cathedral’s edict and risk everything.  

The moment stretches. Gears hover, silent. The creature’s gold eyes plead. You taste metal on your tongue and realize this cathedral isn’t just a place of judgment—it’s your own conscience made material.  

You lift your hand. The blue runes flare. You feel the ground tremble, the clockworks stutter, and time tip imperceptibly out of joint. A single, bright chord rings through the hall as you reach through shimmering air and snap the chains. Silver sparks fly like fireflies. The creature stumbles forward, free at last—but the judges roar in outrage, their wands arcing with crackling light.  

In that fierce glare, you step aside. Time pools at your feet—seconds unfolding in slow motion. The creature gazes up and binds its gratitude around your wrist like a living ribbon. The alabaster figures advance, and the world fractures into shards of color.  

In the final echo, you understand: rules are the scaffolding of civilization, but compassion is its soul. As the shards of your dream burst into a million glittering reflections, you feel the rush of possibility—how every act of mercy, though unauthorized, may reshape the grandest machinery of all.  

Then the swirl of indigo and silver pulls you upward, and you awake with your heart still thrumming to the echo of that impossible cathedral, and the memory of golden eyes blazing with hope.
