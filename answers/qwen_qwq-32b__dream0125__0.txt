I am dreaming. The tournament ahead is a grand, shimmering arena. Its architecture is otherworldly, with spiraling towers of iridescent crystal that hum a low, resonant tune when the wind slips through them. The air smells like petrichor and cinnamon, a paradoxical mix of storm and spice. Contestants from all corners of existence gather here—beings of smoke, constellations woven into flesh, creatures that shift hues like moods. The final round's skill is balance: a precarious walk on a bridge made of liquid light spanning an abyss. But balance has always been my nemesis. I’ve toppled from bikes, misjudged every leap, and stumbled through life’s tightropes.

As the crowd’s whispers swell into a thunder, I step onto the bridge. It ripples underfoot, reacting to my heartbeat. My first step is a revelation—the surface clings and releases like warm syrup. But midway, doubt cracks into panic. The abyss below gapes, teeming with shadowy beings that mimic my fears. They howl my failures: “Remember the bicycle crash on Elm Street? The proposal you chickened out on?” The bridge wavers, thickens, then thins to a hairlike strand.

Then, a voice—not mine—whispers, *Breathe with it, don’t fight it.* The voice belongs to my childhood self, standing at the abyss’s edge, grinning. She holds out a stone skipping on the bridge’s surface. It hops along unbroken. 

I exhale, syncing my rhythm to the bridge’s pulse. The liquid light solidifies beneath each step, reacting to my calm. The shadowy creatures still chant but their words fray into nonsensical syllables. At the center, the bridge becomes a mirror. My reflection’s eyes lock onto mine—there, decades of falls are replayed, not as defeats, but as lessons. Each stumble’s lesson coalesces into a silver thread in my palms.

With these threads, I mend the mirror, weaving it into a net beneath my feet. The bridge stabilizes, the abyss recedes. I cross, the crowd’s roar echoing as the threads ignite into a comet’s tail behind me. The winner’s crown is a constellation formed from the constellations themselves, but when I wear it, it dissolves into my skin, leaving a constellation of scars and stars tattooed over my heart.

**Epilogue:** When I awake, my palms still tingle, and the alarm clock’s melody carries a faint hum of crystal towers. The coffee I spill that morning forms a puddle on the counter that glimmers unnaturally in the sunrise.
