I am dreaming. The air crackles with an otherworldly energy, and the ground beneath me shifts like liquid glass. I see a series of doors arranged in a circle, each adorned with symbols I can’t recognize but feel a strange kinship toward. The first door has a spiral carved into it; the second, a winged serpent; the third, an eye within a triangle. A voice whispers, *Choose, but know that each holds a fragment of what you’ve buried.*  
When I touch the spiral door, visions flood me - a child’s laughter, the taste of stolen candy, the smell of rain on hot pavement. It feels like memory, yet not my own.  
The serpent door pulses beneath my palm, and sudden clarity strikes: I’ve been running from a truth I can’t name. Its coils seem to tighten around my ribs, demanding confession.  
The eye door’s gaze penetrates me, revealing faces of those I’ve loved but distorts them into strangers. Their whispers ask, *Do you recognize us now?*  

I step back, the circle now spinning. Above, constellations form not from stars but from tiny mirrors, each reflecting a different version of myself. **Which door do I choose next?**
