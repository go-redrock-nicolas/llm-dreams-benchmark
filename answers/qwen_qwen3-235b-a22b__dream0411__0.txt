I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of petrichor, though no rain has fallen. You walk through a forest where the trees are not trees at all but towering spires of glass, their translucent trunks humming with the memories of storms. Each step you take sends ripples through the ground, as if the earth itself is a living membrane, breathing in sync with your heartbeat. You are searching for something—or someone—but you don’t yet know what.  

Then you see *her*: a younger version of yourself, curled beneath a gnarled, withered tree that pulses faintly, like a dying star. Her face is streaked with tears that crystallize midair, falling as shards of sapphire. She clutches a letter—yellowed, crumpled, ink smudged by time—that you recognize instantly. It’s the rejection letter from the university you’d dreamed of attending, the one that once felt like the end of the world. Back then, you believed it had severed your path to becoming a writer. Now, the memory of that despair is a cold stone in your chest.  

But something is different here. The tree behind her isn’t just dying; it’s *transforming*. Roots writhe like serpents, burrowing into her shadow, and where they touch, the soil blooms with bioluminescent fungi that glow indigo and gold. You kneel beside her, though she doesn’t see you. Her sobs are quieter now, as if the forest itself is soothing her. You reach out, and your fingers pass through her shoulder like mist.  

Suddenly, the letter in her hands begins to dissolve. The words lift off the page, swirling into the air like fireflies, and rearrange themselves into a sentence you’ve never read before: *“The door you think is closed is only a mirror. Look closer.”* The tree shudders violently, its bark splitting open to reveal a core of molten amber. Inside, you see it—a tiny, perfect sapling, already green and thriving, nestled in the heart of the decay.  

The younger you tilts her head, noticing the sapling. Her tears stop. She presses a palm to the tree’s trunk, and the glass-forest erupts in song—a chorus of wind chimes and whale-song and the laughter of children you’ve never met but somehow know. The shards of her tears rise, reforging themselves into a bridge that arches into the canopy, where constellations swirl like spilled ink. She stands, hesitates, then steps onto the bridge. With every step, the stars rearrange into stories: tales you’ve written since that rejection, stories you’ve lived, the life you built when the first door slammed shut.  

You wake with the taste of copper on your tongue, as if you’ve bitten into a pomegranate seed. The room is dark, but your hands tremble—not with grief, but with the electric certainty that the worst moments of your life were not endings, but alchemy. The tree in your dream was right: the mirror was never meant to show you a dead end. It was showing you the face of the person who would survive the breaking, who would plant herself in the ruins and grow.  

Outside, dawn bleeds into the sky, and for a heartbeat, the light looks like the glow of that sapling—quiet, relentless, alive.
