I am dreaming. You stand at the controls of a nuclear power station as warning sirens pierce the air and emergency lights pulse crimson. Through the reinforced windows, steam billows ominously from the cooling towers. Your white coat is drenched with sweat as you frantically pull back on control rods with spasming hands. The facility shudders violently, and peeling paint falls like radioactive snow.

The pressure gauges are all in the danger zone, their needles actually bent. Alarms wail and lights flash everywhere. In the background, the haunting rattle of reactor fuel rods becoming unstable echoes through the acoustics of the containment building. A metallic taste fills your mouth as you realize you've failed to prevent a meltdown.
