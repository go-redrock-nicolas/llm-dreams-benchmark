I am dreaming. In my dream, I am standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering lake beneath a starlit sky, the moon a luminous orb casting an ethereal glow upon the serene waters. A profound sense of connection to nature courses through me, a quintessential oneness with the ecological tapestry that weaves itself across the land.

Rising into the air, I float above the treetops with the grace of a dove, the cool night breeze caressing my skin as I glide through the atmosphere. From this aerial vantage point, the intricate dance of life below unfolds in all its pulsating vitality. I see the rivaling armies of ant-warriors marching in perfect precision across the forest floor, their tireless workings an essential thread in the vast web of this place.

Undulating through the leaves, a vibrant blue morpho butterfly flutters past, catching the moonlight with its iridescent wings. Driven by an instinctive curiosity, I follow its flight path, descending into the dense foliage. Plummeting through the leafy canopy, I am enveloped by the earthy scent of petrichor and fertile soil, the rich pungency mingling with the sweet perfume of nocturnal blooms. Landing in a moonlit glen, I am greeted by a chorus of birdsong—a lively melody performed by lark and linnet, wren and warbler—and the palpable vibration of nocturnal creatures foraging beneath the surface of the earth.

Stealing softly through the undergrowth, I come to a clearing at the foot of a towering mountain. Waterfalls cascade over the precipice in silver ribbons, at once powerful and serene, carving an arc that echoes the celestial sphere above me. I walk into the misting spray, water droplets collecting on my skin and hair, my body fused with my surroundings as the chlorophyll abundant in the air enters my bloodstream.

A majestic stag steps into the glade, its eyes glinting with ancient wisdom. The creature thumbs into the mist, revealing itself to be a horse of Herne, transforming before my eyes. Drawn to this memory of England's green and pleasant land,a percheron, a cottage, woodlands - old stories reawakened. This is chronology fluid, eternal. I ride the herb-decorated Syrian by Fudanius, the guzzler of souls, and we wander in the hold-fast, a landscape timeless and untouched.

Changing once more, this noble horse is now a beautiful greyhound dog. My dreams give me a glimpse into the avant garde vision of Virginia Woolf. With her luminously progressive and petulant temperament, I can feel her pass through me as I move through the vinegar and oil smudged projects of Renaissance Florence where the dogs of the streets roam free, coeval to the people who live there. The vision comes back to me.

Driving home, I sink into myself through the rustling of the winter branches, the birds hungering, both in their ravenous call and in my own introspection. This melting cabin, the temperatures pressing lower, reflect the mellow dream that slowly extrudes from me as I gently sink into myself. 

 Relinquish the transient fates of choice and consequence, consider the nature of time and perception, then evanesce.
