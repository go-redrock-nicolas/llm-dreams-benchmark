I am dreaming. —in this moment of shimmering, electric uncertainty, I find myself standing at the center of a boundless circular hall. Its domed ceiling glimmers with floating constellations that swirl and pulse to the music of my thumping heart. Surrounding me is a ring of grand doors, each carved with hypnotic patterns that beckon irresistibly.

Each threshold beckons with its own siren-song promise: To the left, a door of shimmering aquamarine glass breaths out a scent like rain on jasmine, whispering of an endless garden where memories blossom on trees and laughter spills from sun-touched fountains. To the right, a heavy door of gnarled midnight wood vibrates with the faint beat of deep drums—a wild forest beyond, where time itself tangles in roots and glowing eyes watch from the darkness.

Straight ahead, a door of rippling silver shimmers tantalizingly, offering fleeting glimpses of impossible cities in the clouds, streets paved with dreams, and companions who never left or wandered away. Another portal, red and alive with the pulse of fire, hints at a carnival of delights, joy spun into gold, and soaring, soul-lifting music that lingers even after the echo fades.

Around me, the choices shimmer and pulse—there is no space for hesitation, only the raw thrill of forced destiny. My hand flies out, compelled by a longing that feels both foreign and desperately familiar, fingers grazing the door of rippling silver. Without breath, without thought, the world tips on its axis—

Suddenly, I am soaring, weightless and giddy, pouring through the silver threshold into a city spun from clouds and starlight. Towers lean and spiral impossibly high, gentle winds lift me from bridge to bridge, and the laughter of old friends rings through airy courtyards where fragments of every choice I might have made dance as motes of light.

Here, complexity is beauty, and indecision is a song sung by the shifting, ever-changing sky. And as I float onward, I realize—every door still beckons in the periphery, waiting for my next wild leap, ready for the next decision in this boundless, radiant dream.
