I am dreaming. I am the captain of a majestic ship, The Tempest, navigating the treacherous waters of a tempest-torn sea. The heavens above me are a swirling maelstrom of black and purple, with veins of lightning streaking across the sky like crackling whipcord. The winds howl and moan, carrying the cries of unseen spirits, while the waves rise up as colossal leviathans, eager to swallow my ship whole.

My crew, a ragtag assembly of battle-hardened sailors and wide-eyed neophytes, exchange nervous glances as the ship pitches violently. The hull groans beneath the ceaseless assault of the waves, its timbers creaking as if they too are pleading for mercy. A lone seagull, its wings buffeted by the storm, circles us once before vanishing into the swirling chaos.

“Captain!” the first mate, a tall man with a grizzled beard, shouts above the din, his voice barely audible. “The hull's breached! We’re taking on water in the lower decks!”

I grip the ship’s wheel tightly, feeling the wood pulsate as if it were alive, or perhaps it’s just the vibration of a ship on the brink of destruction. “All hands on deck!” I bellow, my voice cutting through the storm’s roar. My words reverberate with an authority I didn’t know I had. “Secure the rigging and batten down the hatches! We ride this storm or we go down fighting!”

My men scramble to their posts, tying ropes, bailing water, and reinforcing the weakened hull. A young cabin boy, no more than 15, looks at me with wide eyes, his pale face smeared with soot and rain. “We’ll make it, won’t we, Captain?” he asks, his voice trembling.

I meet his gaze, my eyes steady. “We don’t give up,” I say fiercely. “Not while there’s breath in our lungs and wind in our sails.”

The storm grows worse. A colossal wave crests over the ship, drenching everything in a deluge of salt and fury. I feel the wheel slip beneath my fingers as the ship heel dangerously to one side. For a moment, I see nothing but the churning black water below, but then the ship lurches upright once more, and I find my grip again.

The storm has taken its toll. Two of my crew are down, and I hear the cry of pain from below. My first mate appears beside me again, his eyes wild and his hair plastered to his skull. “Captain, the water’s rising too fast! If we don’t do something soon, we’ll be sunk!”

I take a deep breath, the spray stinging my face like tiny needles, and look up to the heavens. The storm is alive, roaring its defiance at us. But I am alive too, and I will not surrender this ship. “Bring me the albatross!” I shout, my voice barely audible over the storm’s fury.

The first mate’s eyes widen, but he doesn’t question me. Within moments, he returns with a large, wounded seabird, its white feathers stained with the blood of battle. “It’s the only one that survived,” he says, gripping the bird in his arms like a lifeline.

“We’ll send it out,” I say, determination sparking in my chest. “The storm will follow it, or so the legends say.” I take the bird from him, its eyes dull and lifeless as it tilts its head back and lets out one final, haunting cry. I release it into the storm. For an instant, the albatross struggles against the winds, but then it spreads its wings wide, and with a determined flap, it soars into the swirling vortex of the storm.

There’s a moment of stillness—a breath before the world itself collapses—and then, as if by some divine intervention, the winds begin to die down. The waves lose their fury, receding back into the deep, leaving our battered vessel intact, bobbing gently on the waves like a cork. The sun begins to break through the clouds, its golden light reflecting off the waves. I release a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. We’ve made it.

“Quiet!” I bark, adjusting my stance as I peer out into the horizon, the winds whispering my name. My crew shift nervously, their eyes darting between me and the now-calm waters. I raise my hand, and a Dashiell cries out, “She speaks true, Captain!”

Another wave crashes into the ship, but the storm is fading. The clouds tear open to reveal an expanse of stars, twinkling as though they’ve been waiting for this moment.

I raise my fist to the sky, a cry of victory on my lips, knowing the storm isn’t over—yet I have faith in the calm of the night. The Tempest stands triumphant once more.
