I am dreaming. The air hums with the weight of the moment, thick as honey and charged with the scent of ozone before a storm. I stand in a vast, circular chamber where the walls are not walls at all but shifting tapestries of living light—scenes of human joy and suffering flicker like candle flames, each one a heartbeat, a breath, a life.  

Before me, two figures sit in judgment—or perhaps they are the judged. To my left, a being woven from starlight and shadow, their voice the whisper of wind through autumn leaves. They argue for the sanctity of individual choice, for the right to stumble, to learn, to suffer if need be. "To remove pain is to erase growth," they murmur, and the chamber shudders with the echo of a million whispered regrets, each one a lesson etched in scars.  

To my right, a figure of molten gold, their words honeyed fire. They speak of mercy, of a world unshackled from needless agony. "Why must wisdom be carved in wounds?" they ask, and the air shimmers with visions—children laughing without fear, lovers untouched by betrayal, old age without loneliness. The very ground beneath me thrums with the warmth of their promise.  

I feel the decision crystallizing in my chest, sharp as a diamond forming under pressure. The chamber holds its breath. The tapestries still.  

And then—I realize.  

The choice is not between pain and peace.  

It is between a world that is *alive* and one that is *perfect*.  

I open my mouth to speak—  

And wake with the taste of lightning on my tongue.
