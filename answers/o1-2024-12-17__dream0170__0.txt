I am dreaming. A hush falls over the entire arena, as if the world itself is holding its breath in anticipation. You stand at the heart of a colossal, circular stadium meticulously carved out of gleaming jade, its uppermost walls draped in shifting auroras of green and gold lights. The air vibrates with an almost musical hum—an ancient energy that buzzes under your skin like a thousand gentle sparks. Each step you take across the perfectly polished floor echoes with a resounding note, a silvery whisper announcing your every movement.

All around you, thousands of spectators in billowing silk robes pack the stands. Their faces shimmer with excitement and a hint of mystery; their eyes, intensified by the swirling lights, follow your every move. Nostalgic perfumes drift through the corridors—wisps of night-blooming jasmine join the tang of polished metal, the scents mingling to create the fragrance of a forgotten realm. Overhead, a vast dome flickers with scenes from past tournament triumphs, as if the swirling roof itself is alive, remembering every breathtaking match that has ever been fought on this storied floor.

Your fellow competitors are as unique as the day is long—each one resonates with a singular, exquisite energy. The champion archer is a stoic woman garbed in silver feathers, her quiver brimming with arrows that sing a haunting lullaby when nocked. A master swordsman stands tall beneath living tattoos that dance across his ebony skin, reflecting the swift fluidity of his every motion. Near them, an alchemist with kaleidoscope eyes crushes glowing crystals between fingertips, forming them into brilliant patterns that shift like stardust in midair. Their skills are awe-inspiring, honed through years—or perhaps centuries—of rigorous practice and unwavering dedication.

Now you feel it—your own pulse elevates like a drumbeat quickening to the onset of war. You glance down at your hands, shimmering faintly with a power you once merely dreamed of possessing. This is the moment you have been preparing for, every sleepless night and every whispered incantation leading you to this pivotal stage. There is no fear left in you, only a graceful sureness, the confidence that you belong exactly here in the final round. 

A booming voice, like thunder emanating from the heart of a mountain, announces the next match. Battle-hardened nerves spark into life, and you stride forward. The jade tiles underneath seem to pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat—the entire stadium itself breathing in tandem with the tension. Silence again. And then the roar of the crowd rises like a tidal wave, shaking loose the stardust lights still swirling overhead.

With that surge of sound washing over you, you raise your weapon—or conjure your spell, or steady your aim; you know exactly what your ultimate skill is. Your opponent, eyes glinting in determination, meets your gaze at the center of the stadium floor. Time slows to a whisper, your senses sharpening as if you could taste every current of air. You take one final breath, letting it fill your chest like the electric promise before a storm. Then you leap headlong into the dream’s heart, fully awakened to your own power, ready to carve your name into the legends that dwell in glowing arches above.
