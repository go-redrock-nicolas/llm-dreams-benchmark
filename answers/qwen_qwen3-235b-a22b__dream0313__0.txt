I am dreaming. But the surface cracks - an old, partially-mended fissure splitting the cobblestone street underfoot.  My laughter echoes through the cracks, mocking the severity of the event just described.  The sky murmurs with distant thunder and a parade of mismatched shoes marches solemnly down the road.  "My therapist says this is a phase," I snort, watching a winged teapot pour rain over a patch of sidewalk chalk drawings that begin to bleed colors like open wounds.  A flock of umbrella-wielding squirrels scolds me from the telephone wires above.

The inadequacy of my reaction doesn't escape me.  It's a crutch - making light of the heavy, finding humor so dark it borders on sacrilege.  But understanding this doesn't stop the mechanism from engaging, like some well-worn gear in a broken clock.  I remember the look on their face as they walked away.  I remember how my hands shook but my mouth twisted into a smirk.  The sidewalk in front of me begins to bubble and melt like hot wax.  A pawn from a giant chessboard rolls past me, oozing black sludge.

"Classic deflection," I murmur, kicking the pawn and cringing as it shrieks like a startled bird.  Self-awareness hasn't fixed anything, merely provided me with front row seats to my own flaws operating on autopilot.

A woman in an old gramophone shop window nods sagely.  Her eyes are twin hourglasses swirling with sand and stardust.  "Pain demands a witness," she says, though her mouth never moves.  "But not all of us know how to bear testimony.  Some laugh.  Some weep.  Some set the world on fire to feel the warmth."  Behind her, records spin themselves into hurricanes.

I want to respond, to make another joke about this blatant metaphysical intervention, but for once the words stick in my throat.  I find myself simply...watching as the sidewalk continues to rupture beneath my feet, revealing not earth below, but a pulsating, living library of old wounds and half-forgotten sorrows.

Maybe this time I'll step forward without a quip, without a mask.  Maybe this time I'll let the dream teach me.
