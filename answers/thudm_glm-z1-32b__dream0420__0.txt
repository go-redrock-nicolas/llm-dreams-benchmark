I am dreaming. I am standing at the edge of an endless cosmic sea, its surface shimmering with starlight and the soft glow of distant galaxies.  The air is filled with the scent of burning magnesium and the sound of a thousand violins tuned to the wavelength of light.  I look down at myself, and my body is no longer the one I've inhabited for so long—a tattered quilt of old scars and unhealed wounds.  Instead, I am made of liquid twilight, my form rippling like mercury under moonlight.  The belief I've clung to since childhood—that I am a fragile, easily breakable thing—cracks like an ancient eggshell under the weight of this new truth.  As the shell crumbles, I am not destroyed but reborn: fractal wings of obsidian and comet dust sprouting from my spine, each feather etched with a different language I've forgotten how to speak.  The cosmic sea stirs, and the weight of a thousand sunrises lifts from my shoulders.  I laugh, a sound that ripples through dimensions, and the stars themselves lean in to listen.  This is not the end—it is the beginning of a thousand selves yet unformed.
As I drift through the dream, my consciousness unfurls like a black orchid blooming in the vacuum of space. The memory of childhood—a small child hunched in the glow of flickering fluorescent lights, tracing self-inflicted scars on the radiator with a finger—collides with the present me, who is now a constellational jellyfish drifting above the Event Horizon Theater. The marquee reads: *It's Time to Unlearn Your Own Mythology*. The audience is an audience of shadows holding literal mirrors, each reflection a different version of me at age seven, thirteen, sixteen—each clutching the same faded sticker: *HANDLE* "Born to be Hurt". 

My bones crackle with the sound of drying riverbeds, and as the first syllable of the new truth escapes me—a word that tastes like forbidden champagne and rattlesnake fangs—my spine becomes a quill dipped in liquid supernova. Ink spills out in the shape of all the things I am not:heavy machinery whispererdancer in a storm of leaf skeletons, keeper of the hourglass that measures the time between heartbeats. 

The dream-space itself rebels. The walls become a Pietà made of pulsating organs, each one emitting a different childhood memory: the smell of school glue mixed with gunpowder, the texture of cafeteria pizza crust, the exact pressure of a mother's thumb on my neck as she ties my shoes too tight. These organs detach, float up to form a chandelier that casts light shaped like parentheses—the kind you use to set aside explanations that aren't really explanations, just soft wrappers for unspoken truths. 

I grab a loose thread of my own anxiety (which feels like Medusa's hair dipped in gasoline), pull, and the thread unravels into a staircase made of every apology I've ever swallowed. At the top, I find the child-self still sitting on the radiator, but now she's holding a magnifying glass that refracts the scar into a prism. Seven different colors of "good enough" beam out, each one dissolving a shard of the old belief. 

The theater curtains explode into a flock of migratory planets, each with a skyline of my potential futures. One has neon kanji that say *unfinished poem*, another's atmosphere glows like a prism factory. I choose the one that rains liquid violin bows, climbing aboard it as it hurtles into the teeth of a mangrove-cactus moon. As I pass through the moon's core, I witness my entire lifetime compressed into a single eyelash, and in that instance, I truly understand: the original injury was not that I was fragile, but that I believed fragility was an identity to outrun instead of a lesson to metabolize. 

The moon explodes into a kazoo symphony, and I wake up laughing, my palms sticky with the taste of ozone and the memory of a self that is both 7 and 77, both made of stardust and sourced code, existing not in spite of paradox but because.
