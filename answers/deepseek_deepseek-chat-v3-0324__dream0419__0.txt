I am dreaming. The air around me hums with a strange, electric warmth, like the charged silence before a storm. The ground beneath my feet is not solid—it shifts like liquid mercury, reflecting fractured images of myself in its rippling surface. Above me, the sky is a swirling canvas of indigo and gold, streaked with veins of light that pulse like a living thing.  

Then, the voices begin.  

They come from everywhere and nowhere, soft at first, like distant echoes in a cathedral. *"You did so well." "That was incredible." "You deserve this."* Each word lands like a weight, pressing into my skin, making my chest tighten. I try to step back, but the ground resists, clinging to my feet like tar.  

A figure materializes before me—a mirror version of myself, but glowing faintly, as if lit from within. Their eyes are kind, but their smile is too wide, too knowing. They reach out, offering a crown woven from starlight and thorns. *"Take it,"* they whisper. *"It’s yours."*  

I recoil. The crown burns where it nearly touches my fingers, searing with a cold fire. Shadows coil around my wrists, whispering doubts: *"What if you fail next time? What if they see you for what you really are?"* The voices of praise grow louder, twisting, morphing into something suffocating. The sky darkens, the stars blinking out one by one.  

Then—a shift. A single, defiant thought rises: *Why does kindness feel like a threat?*  

The mirror-self tilts their head, waiting. The crown dims, the thorns retracting, leaving only delicate strands of light. The ground steadies beneath me, solidifying into cool, smooth stone. The voices don’t disappear, but they soften, no longer crushing—just floating, like leaves on water.  

I take a breath. The dream holds its silence.  

And for the first time, I reach out.
