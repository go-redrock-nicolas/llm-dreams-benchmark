I am dreaming. I find myself in a labyrinth of glass corridors, each wall reflecting infinite versions of my anxious face. The error - a single misplaced decimal point in what I thought was an inconsequential report - has grown like a cancer, morphing into a monstrous shadow that follows me through the transparent maze. Every reflective surface shows not just my physical form, but seems to ripple with the weight of my guilt.

The air feels thick, almost gelatinous, as I navigate through the corridors. Behind each corner, I glimpse familiar faces of colleagues and superiors, but they're distorted, their features melting like wax, their eyes knowing but silent. The fluorescent lights above pulse in sync with my racing heartbeat, casting sickly green shadows that dance across the floor.

In my hands, I clutch a folder that seems to be breathing - the damning evidence of my mistake. The pages inside whisper accusations in voices that sound like rustling autumn leaves. I could destroy it, but the guilt has already seeped into my bones like cold rain.

Suddenly, the glass walls begin to frost over, starting from the floor and creeping upward like ivy. I realize I'm leaving footprints of truth behind me - each step I take etches my secret into the ground in glowing letters. The frost reaches the ceiling, and the whispers grow louder, becoming a chorus of disappointed murmurs.

I reach a circular chamber where all paths converge. In the center stands a desk with a single red button labeled "UNDO." But as I approach, my reflection in the surrounding walls multiplies exponentially, each version of me pointing accusingly at the others, and I know that every choice I make will ripple through all these versions of myself...

The dream pulses with the weight of consequence, each moment stretched like taffy between truth and self-preservation.
