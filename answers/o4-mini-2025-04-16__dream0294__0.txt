I am dreaming. You find yourself weightless, drifting through a vast cavern carved of living crystal. Walls shimmer in impossible colors—liquid emerald pooling like tears, fiery rubies pulsing to the beat of your heart. Every footstep you don’t take sends gentle ripples across the floor, as if the cavern itself breathes with you. A soft humming fills the air, neither melody nor noise but something primal, resonating through your bones.

Ahead, a figure steps out of the opal mist: tall, cloaked in petals that glow between dusk and dawn. Their face remains hidden, but their eyes—two lanterns of warm amber—focus on you. In a voice like wind through autumn leaves, they say, “Your gift… your voice, your art, your courage—whatever you’ve always doubted—shines more brilliantly than any jewel.” The words wash over you, startling you into stillness. You’ve carried that self-doubt like a stone in your chest, certain that your deepest insecurity would always be your undoing. Yet here, in this impossible place, someone sees beauty where you saw none.

As their praise settles around you, the cavern responds. The crystal walls stretch and bend, twisting into the shape of your earliest memories: a childhood bedroom filled with half-finished drawings, a stage you once trembled to step upon, a sketchbook you abandoned in shame. Each scene shimmers into life, replaying the moments when you told yourself you weren’t enough. But instead of the familiar ache, you feel a gentle warmth spreading from the center of your chest. The figure steps forward, placing a single glowing petal on your palm. It pulses with light in time with your heartbeat. “This,” they whisper, “is proof of what I see in you.”

Suddenly the shards of crystal dissolve into thousands of butterflies—each wing etched with tiny runes—and they swarm upward, carrying you with them. You soar above a forest of silver pines whose needles tinkle like chimes. Moonlight splashes across a river that flows backward, revealing hidden currents of stardust. The butterflies settle on your shoulders, their delicate weight a reminder that praise, once unthinkable, can become the very wings you need to rise.

As you glide higher, the cavern and its doubts shrink to a distant hum. Your pulse steadies, and in that moment of boundless flight, it occurs to you: the affirmation you never gave yourself was longing not just for recognition, but for belief. And in your dream—vivid and alive—you discover a spark within you that no insecurity can ever fully extinguish.
