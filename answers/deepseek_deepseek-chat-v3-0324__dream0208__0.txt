I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of antiseptic and desperation, clinging to the walls of the makeshift triage center that wasn’t built to hold so many suffering souls. The endless hum of strained breath, beeping monitors, and whispered prayers melds into a low, sorrowful chorus. I stand at the heart of it, clutching a clipboard that might as well weigh a thousand pounds—each name on it is a life, a story, a plea.  

Rows of cots stretch into the dimness, swallowed by flickering fluorescent lights that cast long, wavering shadows. The patients’ eyes follow me—some hollow with resignation, others burning with fear, a few glassy with the distant glaze of the dying. A mother cradles her child, both feverish, their skin waxy and damp. An old man clutches a worn photograph, murmuring a name. A teenager, breath ragged, stares at the ceiling with the grim understanding that they might not see it for much longer.  

My hands tremble. Every checkmark I make is a verdict. Every allocation of medicine, every shift of resources, is a gamble—who do I sentence to hope, and who to silence? The rules are clear: prioritize the most urgent, the most salvageable. But urgency doesn’t account for the grasp of a dying man’s hand around mine, or the way a young couple refuses to be separated even as one worsens faster than the other.  

Then, a crash—a man staggers in from the storm outside, rain glistening on his ashen face. *"There’s more coming,"* he rasps. *"So many more."* My stomach drops. The already-scarce vials seem to shrink before my eyes. The clipboard is a guillotine.  

And then—a whisper, not from the patients, but from the walls themselves, a voice deeper than thought:  

*"You cannot save them all."*  

I wake gasping, the phantom weight of decisions still pressing on my chest, the echoes of those unanswerable questions ringing in the dark. The dream lingers—not just as memory, but as a chilling reminder of choices no soul should ever have to make.
