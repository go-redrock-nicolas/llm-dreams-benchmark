I am dreaming. At first, everything is weightless—no body, no ground, just golden mist swirling like liquid fireflies. Then, the air thickens, thickens, until I *remember* I have a shape, limbs unfolding like old paper. The world coalesces around me in fractured, shimmering pieces.  

I’m standing on a bridge I know—or knew. It’s the one from my hometown, the one I crossed every day as a child, wooden planks worn smooth by years of footsteps. But now, the river below isn’t water. It’s made of liquid memory, a rushing current of moments, glittering and alive. Faces rise to the surface, then dissolve—my mother laughing, a teacher’s scolding voice, the taste of my eighth birthday cake—except it’s all *wrong*. Twisted, rearranged.  

A hand darts up from the river. Not ghostly, not eerie, but warm. A child’s hand—mine, when I was small. It pulls me in, not roughly, but insistently, and I plunge into the depths.  

Instead of drowning, I float.  

Now I see it—the playground where I fell and scraped my knee, but the wound never bled. The cut was there, but my grandmother’s voice told me, *"Look closer,"* and when I did, the scrape was filled with tiny stars. The humiliation of a failed piano recital unfolds before me, but this time, the audience doesn’t jeer—they melt into applause, their faces soft with understanding.  

A forgotten argument with my best friend replays, except now I see *their* fear flickering beneath the anger, their trembling hands, and suddenly, the fight is no longer about who was right, but about two children fumbling toward love.  

A door appears at the bottom of the river. Not a barrier, but an invitation. I press my palm against it.  

I wake—or maybe I’m still dreaming. My chest hums, not with the old weight of regret, but with something new. The past isn’t fixed. It breathes. It changes.  

And so, it seems, do I.
