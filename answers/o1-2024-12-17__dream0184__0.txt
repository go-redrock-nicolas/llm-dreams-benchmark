I am dreaming. In this uncanny, inside-out cosmos, nothing is ever guaranteed except for the unexpected. The moment I open my eyes—or whatever sense passes for sight in this bizarre dimension—I find myself suspended in a sky where violet clouds wreathe around shimmering walnut-colored suns (yes, multiple suns, but almost never where you’d expect to see them). They spontaneously pop in and out of existence like mischievous fireflies, defying all logic I once held dear.

Down below, I see a terrain composed of wispy, pastel ribbons that drift and tangle, forming a living tapestry as perplexing as a labyrinth. Each ribbon pulse-changes color with a quicksilver flourish, and just when I think the color can’t possibly get any more vivid, it shifts again into a hue I cannot even name. The ground feels half-solid, half-liquid beneath my feet, its consistency changing from step to step. Sometimes the surface bucks and cracks, forming a canyon, only to melt seconds later into wide, floaty plains. 

All the while, improbable events occur with startling frequency. One moment, a cluster of giant hummingbirds flutters by, each the size of a horse, their emerald feathers glinting like polished jewels. In the next, those birds flicker out of existence entirely, leaving behind a single featherspark drifting lazily to the ground. Soon after, a swirl of what appear to be ghostly koi fish glides through the air. They pass through the lilac clouds and vanish, reappearing an instant later as ivy-green dragonflies. Everything changes shape and quality, as though the very molecules of the world keep rewriting themselves on a cosmic whim.

To survive, let alone function, in this inverted probability realm, I must relinquish the expectation of consistent cause and effect. I need to trust, paradoxically, in the unlikeliest outcomes. Like a painter who dips a brush into emptiness and somehow conjures color, I open my arms wide and imagine wings sprouting from my shoulders. The mere thought triggers a gentle prickling on my back, and then, as if in a dream (which, of course, it is), enormous shimmering wings spread out, arching toward the pink-and-ochre horizon.

My first attempt at flight is met with a jolt, as though the gravity here can’t decide whether to tug me downward or catapult me into the sky. With every movement, I have to expect the unexpected. I leap, and for an instant, find I can’t rise at all. Panic seizes me—will I be stuck? Then a cosmic toss of the dice occurs, and I suddenly rocket upward, surpassing the floating reefs and driftwood spires. I spiral among those bizarre ballooning shapes, trailing arcs of pale fluorescence. The dream-world’s air tastes of stardust and crushed mint leaves, though there is no breeze, only the gentle ripples of improbability tickling against my cheeks.

Far off in the distance is some sort of structure that appears both colossal and minuscule at once, like a fractal dream-castle. It hovers, or perhaps it’s anchored by translucent pillars. In this reality, vantage points can fool me: large things can unexpectedly shrink as I approach, or distant objects may suddenly warp next to me without traveling. Determined, I decide that is my destination—though I don’t know why, only that it exudes a soft golden light, calling me to witness more marvels.

As I set my course, each flap of my fantastical wings conjures a new swirl of probabilities: swirling confetti in myriad shifting shapes, tinkling bells from distant regions, the improbable taste of chocolate drifting over my tongue. In one singular instant, gravity inverts entirely—I find myself calmly sailing upside down. The pink-and-ochre firmament becomes a glassy floor above me, and the pastel ribbons beneath me become a sky I tread upon. My wings remain, strangely unaffected. If anything, they sense the disturbance and flutter more eagerly, carrying me gracefully in my chosen direction despite the planet’s sudden whim to invert itself.

Eventually, I reach the fractal tower. Its intricate corridors fold back upon themselves, each archway vanishing into a swirl of kaleidoscopic patterns. Inside, phenomenon piles upon phenomenon: waterfalls tumble upward or sideways, leading to shimmering pools that evaporate the moment they spill. Entire libraries of books blink in and out of shelves, the texts writing and rewriting themselves spontaneously, pages scrawled with swirling hieroglyphs that hold the gravitational formula for a thousand improbable realities. 

A dancing, velvety darkness sweeps across the structure without warning. It’s night now—or at least the dream’s version of night. The starfield overhead is breathtaking: swirling constellations shaped like improbable animals—lion-headed serpents, winged turtles, five-tailed phoenixes—drift across the skies, flickering so bright they leave afterimages on my vision, then wink out into emptiness. Meanwhile, the sounds around me have changed, too: a distant orchestral hum resonates from the same fractal library, like the low, warm thrum of cellos. Is it truly music, or have I simply begun hearing probability itself as it sculpts the architecture around me?

I realize that, to remain here and thrive, I must master the art of expectation inversion. I close my eyes, and where I might normally cling to logic, I simply allow fluid chance to guide me. My thoughts drift on waves of color and sound, and I find that letting go is the only real rule: do not attempt to impose bound laws upon a place that defies them. Instead, I become a mindful passenger, leaning into the impossible, letting each new wonder wash over me like warm, star-laced rain.

At last, I feel a gentle stirring within my chest: am I beginning to wake? Already, the fractal tower begins to break apart into shimmering bits of geometry, flickering in rainbow fractals. The dimension’s skies fold in on themselves, the vibrant ribbons and souls of ephemeral birds swirling into a gleaming cosmic funnel. The closeness of a new reality—the one I recognize as ‘real’—beckons me onward. 

And just before gravity switches back to normal, before the improbable events wink out in favor of predictable cause-and-effect, I embrace the last gasp of strangeness. In that inhale, I take with me a bittersweet memory of reversed probability. My heart quickens and expands, as though I’ve glimpsed the universe’s hidden places. Then I marvel at how quickly it slips away, like morning mist perched upon a sliver of dawn, gone the moment I open my eyes to the waking world once again.
