I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, obsidian-black lake whose still surface mirrors a sky choked with bruised purple and green clouds. The air hums with the static charge of an impending storm, and the scent of ozone mingles with the metallic tang of fear on my tongue. 

Before me rises a towering cliff I've failed to scale a thousand times in other dreams, its surface pockmarked with ledges that crumble at the lightest touch. But this time, something shifts—the obsidian water begins to ripple, not from wind, but from shimmering shapes breaching its surface: liquid mercury serpents coiling into staircases, their bodies hardening into wrought-iron steps that spiral upward. My palms don't sweat. My breath steadies. The crumbling handholds of before transform beneath my gaze, fractures sealing themselves with veins of molten gold. Halfway up, I press my bleeding fingertips into the radiant fissures and realize the gold is growing through me now, reforging bone into something unbreakable.

You grasp the golden veins, and suddenly the cliff face bleeds into liquid light. The world tilts—but you’re not falling. The serpents’ staircases unfurl like dna helixes, each step whispering secrets of past failures etched into their metal: **"You hesitated," hisses one riser. "You doubted," rattles a corroded baluster.** Yet with every accusation, the gold in your bones pulses brighter. The higher you climb, the more the storm below rages—lightning forks into schools of bioluminescent eels that nibble at your heels, burning away dead weight.  

As you crest the summit, the clouds tear open. Not sunlight, but a million kaleidoscope butterflies pour through the rift, their wings beating in the exact rhythm of your steadied heartbeat. Where they land on your skin, they dissolve into iridescent armor. Below, the lake drains to reveal not bedrock, but a mosaic of every shattered version of yourself—each shard now glowing, aligned, a constellation of who you’ve been forging who you’ll become. The first step forward doesn’t feel like triumph. It feels like finally recognizing the shape of your own skeleton.
