I am dreaming.

In the endless canvas of my mind, clouds of thought swirl and merge, conjuring illusions more vivid than daylight. Tonight, the world of dreams comes alive as a labyrinthine city beneath a violet sky. Towers gleam with tessellated mirrors; alleyways wind like silver serpents, becoming impossible whenever followed.

I wander these gleaming avenues, yet, like a persistent undertow, I sense unease—familiar shadows multiplying at the edges. It is the upcoming challenge: a looming summit, a test, an ordeal unknown but formidable. The city warps as my mind conjures disaster upon disaster, painting streets with images of failure, echoes of laughter, the weight of disappointment.

But something deep within me stirs. I become both witness and architect here. I pause in the center of a plaza where the stones pulse gently, infused with opaline light. I speak aloud, my voice both trembling and resolute, and the air shivers with understanding.

“These are only specters of fear,” I say, watching them swirl before me. I step forward, feeling a warm wind rise up—the city’s heart beating in harmony with mine. The worst-case scenarios become visible: towering faceless judges, crumbling bridges over vast chasms, doors locked tight. But as I address them, their solidity melts; they become gossamer veils of mist.

“In this dream, I see you: the catastrophes my mind constructs in its anxious solitude. But you are not Reality—only mirrors reflecting shadows. Let me walk through you, let me test your substance.”

And so I do—passing through the locked doors as if they were merely painted scenery, finding the crumbled bridges become wide and sturdy beneath my feet, feeling the faceless judges bow respectfully as I move past. The terrible city floods with golden dawn. Colors become more vibrant, the air fragrant with blooming possibility. I recognize creative potential hidden within every imagined disaster. Each ominous form becomes a teacher, each crisis a catalyst for transformation.

At the end, I look at my hands, luminous and strong. The nightmare world recedes into gentle coherence—a place where challenge is only a call to courage, where unseen allies and strengths wait to be revealed. Here, in the lucid core of my dreaming, I learn to see catastrophe not as destiny, but as the wild script of imagination, ready to be rewritten—each fear answered not by retreat, but by the bright and patient power of hope.
