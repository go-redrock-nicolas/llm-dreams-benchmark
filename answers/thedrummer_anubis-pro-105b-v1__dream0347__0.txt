I am dreaming. I notice the butterflies in my stomach. The knots rising to my throat, the clamminess of my clammy hands, and the weight on my shoulders seeming heavier than usual. I am going to have to punch my timecard and see my boss. I hate going in. It always ends up in an argument. My boss always wants to know why I'm late. He always tries to blame everything on me. He doesn't listen.

After work, I'm going to meet some friends at a bar for happy hour. Okay? The crowd is overwhelming. But, I know I need to pick myself up. I can't let work issues affect my social life. The clinking of glasses and the lively tunes pick up my mood surprisingly quickly. It's good to have such amazing friends by my side. 

But I couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom. I cannot predict what tomorrow will bring. I'll do everything in my control, I'll show up early, ready to work, but my boss can still find fault in my efforts. Nothing seems to be going right. No matter how hard I try, I still have to witness the shameless characters continue down the wrong path.

Perhaps I am dreaming of an alternate reality- or a nightmare. The path forward seems shrouded in uncertainty. There's light outside, but it doesn't reach me. It casts a shadow on my neck. I cannot cease to ponder the way reality ails me. I step into my reality, and suddenly the audacity of the cruel world shakes my dream into oblivion.
