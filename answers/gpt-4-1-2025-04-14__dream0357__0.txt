I am dreaming.

Mist curls above an ink-dark sea. My breathing, ragged and urgent, is the only sound in the stagnant, salt-laden air. Shadows stretch and ripple over waters that never reveal their depths. In the unsteady distance, an enormous creature—a lunar-eyed kraken or perhaps a living storm—shifts beneath the waves, tendrils grazing the battered hull of the rowboat I cling to. Its presence is dread, and it has just let me go, inexplicably sparing me. My heart pounds like a warning drum.

I sit there, drenched and trembling, and realize: I am alive by mere chance. My palms cling tight to the splintered wood, aching with the pressure of survival and the abrupt intrusion of awareness. My mind spins: I felt the creature’s eyes—implacable, ancient—see right through the fragile barrier of my skin to the core of my being, and found it wanting… or perhaps simply mortal.

With every shaky inhale, existence suddenly feels sharp-edged and precious. The stars above—strange constellations that I’ve never seen before—begin to pulse in time with my heart. Each is a pinprick of possibility on the ink-dark tapestry of forever, yet here I am, impossibly, at the center of it all. The world spreads beneath me: not infinite, but tenuous, each moment suspended above the abyss.

As my adrenaline ebbs, and the sea hushes, a gentle bioluminescent glow stirs beneath the water, revealing a swirling ballet of light and color. As if the sea itself grieves for the countless lost hopes and loves that have tumbled beneath its surface, but also celebrates every improbable escape from oblivion. I dip my hand into the water, watching alien blues and eerie greens spiral out from my touch.

The realization anchors itself within me—not as a cold stone, but as a warming beacon: life is precious because it is uncertain; its value comes from its impermanence. Suddenly, the line between terror and awe blurs. I sit in silence, shivering and watchful, but also newly reverent, resolved to linger in every fragile, beautiful moment before the dream’s dawn washes it all away.
