I am dreaming. I am dreaming that I am hiking in the mountains with my friends.  We are following a trail that leads to a beautiful lake where we hope to see some
wildflowers and maybe even a bear.   But suddenly, everything changes.   Suddenly, I realize that I am alone.  My friends have disappeared.  I don't know how or why.
I only know that I am scared and confused.  

Then I hear a noise.  A loud cracking sound like thunder but worse.    I look up and see a huge boulder rolling down toward me.   It is getting closer and
closer.   Faster and faster.    

I try to run but my legs won't move.   My feet are stuck in the snow.    I try to scream but no sound comes out of my mouth.   I try to pray but all I can think of
is "God please help me".   

Just as the boulder is about to hit me, I wake up.  I open my eyes and see my bedroom with its familiar walls and ceiling and floor.   I breathe a sigh of relief.
I'm alive. 

But then I remember something else.   A voice whispering in my ear.    Telling me not to worry because someone will save me soon.   Who are you?  Why are you
doing this?

And that's when I realize that it wasn't really a dream at all.   It was just my imagination playing tricks on me.   Or maybe it was something else entirely.
Maybe it was...
