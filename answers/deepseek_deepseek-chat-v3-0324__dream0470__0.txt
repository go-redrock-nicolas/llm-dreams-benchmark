I am dreaming. The air hums with a golden luminescence, thick as honey, and every breath I take tastes like starlight and ripe peaches. The ground beneath me isn’t solid—it ripples like liquid silk, shifting between moss-soft grass and warm, wet sand with each step I take.  

Ahead, a vast orchard stretches endlessly, but the trees don’t bear ordinary fruit. Instead, their branches drip with glistening, translucent globes—each one a captured moment from my life, glowing from within. I reach out, and my fingers brush against one. Instantly, I’m inside it.  

I’m sitting at a rain-streaked window as a child, watching droplets race down the glass. The sound of my mother humming in the next room wraps around me like a quilt. The warmth of that memory—so ordinary, so easily forgotten—fills me with a sweetness so intense it aches. I had taken that moment for granted, but now, here in this dream, it feels sacred.  

The orchard shifts. The trees whisper, their leaves rustling in a language just beyond comprehension. Another fruit pulses invitingly. This time, I’m standing in a crowded subway years ago, shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers. A man across from me, weary-eyed, offers his seat to an elderly woman. The way her face softens, the way he nods without expecting thanks—it was a fleeting kindness, one I barely registered then. But now, in this dream-space, the beauty of it blooms inside me like a flower made of light.  

Gratitude isn’t just a feeling here—it’s a living force. It curls around my limbs, seeps into my bones. The more I notice, the more the dream expands. Forgotten laughter, unspoken kindnesses, the way sunlight used to stripe the floor of my first apartment in the mornings—all of them are here, shimmering, waiting to be remembered.  

A river appears, cutting through the orchard, its water singing in a voice made of wind chimes and distant thunder. I step in, and the current carries me, not away, but deeper—into the heart of all the small, beautiful things I never paused to cherish.  

And then, just as the dream threatens to dissolve, I hear it—a whisper from the trees, the river, the very air: *"You are alive. You have always been this loved."*  

And for the first time, I believe it.
