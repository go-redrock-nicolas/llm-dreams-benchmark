I am dreaming. The air is thick, humming with an electric tension that raises the hairs on my arms. Around me, the world pulses in shades of molten crimson and bruised violet, the sky a writhing canvas of storm clouds that crackle with suppressed lightning. The ground beneath my feet is not solid—it shifts like the skin of some vast, restless beast, hot to the touch, trembling with pent-up fury.

I stand at the edge of a black mirror lake, its surface so still it seems frozen, yet beneath it, shadows coil and thrash like trapped serpents. My reflection stares back at me, but it’s not my face—it’s something older, sharper, eyes blazing like embers, lips curled into a snarl. And then it speaks, its voice the sound of grinding stone and splintering bone.

*"You cannot keep me here,"* it hisses. *"You cannot bury me forever."*

A wave of heat surges through me, the anger I’ve locked away now boiling over, searing my veins. My hands clench into fists, nails biting into my palms, but instead of pain, flames erupt from my skin—tongues of fire that dance and writhe, alive with my rage. The lake’s surface shatters as the thing within rises, a shadow given form, its body a swirling mass of darkness and flickering embers.

I should be afraid. But the rage is a wildfire inside me now, and it feels *good*. With a roar that shakes the dreamscape, I lunge forward, and we collide in a burst of sparks and smoke. The fight is brutal, primal—each strike lands like thunder, each snarl tears at the air. The shadow claws at me, whispering of every slight, every betrayal, every moment I swallowed my fury instead of setting it free.

But this time, I do not yield. This time, I *burn*.

With a final, furious cry, I seize the shadow by its throat and *pull*. It comes apart like charred paper, the fragments dissolving into ash on the scorching wind. The lake boils away, the sky clears to a blood-red dawn, and for the first time, the air feels clean—scorched, but pure.

I wake gasping, my skin tingling, the ghost of flames still flickering behind my eyelids. And I understand: some fires cannot be smothered. Some must be let loose, to ravage, to cleanse. The anger is still there. But now, it is *mine*.
