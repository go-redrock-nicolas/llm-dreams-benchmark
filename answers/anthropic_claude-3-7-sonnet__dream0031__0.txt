I am dreaming. I'm on a crowded subway, pressed between a businessman clutching his leather briefcase and a young woman with headphones trailing blue light across her neck. The fluorescent lights flicker once, twice—then plunge us into perfect darkness as the train shudders to a halt with a metallic groan that resonates through the cars. The momentum throws bodies against each other, muffled apologies overlapping in the sudden silence where the engine's hum should be.

In the blackness, whispers start like kindling catching fire. A child whimpers somewhere to my left. Someone's phone illuminates a small circle of frightened faces, their features distorted by the harsh upward light. Panic blooms like ink in water—I feel it spreading through the car, shoulders tensing, breathing quickening.

But then—something extraordinary happens. The darkness... shifts. The subway walls seem to dissolve, revealing not the expected concrete tunnel, but a vast cosmic expanse. Stars bleed through the metal frame of the train, constellations unfamiliar yet somehow deeply recognizable. The passengers fall silent as celestial light bathes our faces.

I reach out to touch the dissolving barrier between the subway car and this cosmic ocean, and my fingers pass through, trailing stardust. The businessman beside me gasps as gravity seems to loosen its hold. Objects—phones, scarves, coins—begin to float gently upward.

The train itself is transforming, its metal skin peeling back like petals opening to moonlight, revealing that we're traveling not through a tunnel but across the universe itself, carried on solar winds toward an enormous ringed planet that fills the horizon with impossible colors—shades that have no names in any human language.

And somehow, I understand that we are exactly where we need to be.
