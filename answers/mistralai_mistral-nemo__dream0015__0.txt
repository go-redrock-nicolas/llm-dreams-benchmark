I am dreaming. I wake up in a world I barely recognize. The sun hangs low in the sky, its glow a weak and sickly yellow, as if the very atmosphere has turned to rust. The city I once knew is now a labyrinth of crumbling concrete and twisted metal, overrun by time and nature. The buildings lean like forgotten drunkards, their windows staring out like blank, hollow eyes.

I'm standing in the middle of a broad avenue, once teeming with life, now reduced to a Wellington boot-stomping mud bath. The asphalt has been swallowed by weeds, their green tendrils snaking up through cracks and crevices, reaching out like skeletal fingers. The trees, once neatly trimmed and boulevard-worthy, are now colossal, their roots buckling the streets, their gnarled branches stretching out like skeletal arms, castingudinously eerie shadows.

A crimson sunbeat down, making the air dance in shimmering heatwaves. The acrid smell of smoke and the lingering stench of decay fill my nostrils. Despite the stifling heat, a chill runs down my spine, not just from the cold, but from the desolation, the emptiness, the silence - broken only by the distant crumbling of masonry and the raucous cackle of crows.

I husk the remnants of my surroundings, searching for any sign of civilization. A faded billboard, nearly swallowed by ivy, reads "Welcome to Neo-Essex 3000," its baby blue pleasure dome now a grimy, peeling fraud. A toppled statue of a once-revered figure lies half-buried in rubble, its face shattered, a lone bird standing on its shoulder - a king without a kingdom.

In the distance, the remains of the Eiffel Tower loom, its pinnacle sheathed in pulsating, iridescent energy - the only sign of life, of power, in this world turned to art deco ruins. A makeshift bridge suspension, a bridge made of the hollowed-out shells of cars, stretches out from my end of the city, swaying gently in the wind, leading towards the tower. It's the only way forward.

I take a step, my boot squelching in the mud. As I walk, the silence feels heavy, oppressive. It's not the silence of peace, but the silence of the void. The world holds its breath, waiting. I can feel it, a weight on my shoulders, a pressure behind my eyes. This is a world that doesn't just want to be saved, it needs to be.

I look back one more time, at the remnants of what was, and take a deep breath. Then, I walk towards the makeshift bridge, towards the energy-drenched tower, towards life, towards hope, into the heart of the future.
