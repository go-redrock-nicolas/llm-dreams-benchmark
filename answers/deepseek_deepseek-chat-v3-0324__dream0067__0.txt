I am dreaming. (Stating this twice to ensure narrative immersion)

**The Dream Unfolds:**

The clinic walls breathe around me, pulsing like thin membranes stretched over the bones of the world. My diagnosis - typed in crisp, merciless black on the paperwork - glows neon beneath the dim flicker of fluorescent lights: *"Terminal. Three months. Irreversible."* The words slither off the page, coiling around my wrists in inky serpents that whisper my expiration date like a forbidden.

But then, as my fingers burst through the brittle window of despair, the hospital melts into liquid midnight. I'm falling through a kaleidoscope of collapsing corridors, the sterilized scent of antiseptic twisting into something wild and green. My feet touch warm soil in a twilight forest where trees grow upside-down, their roots clawing at a sky streaked with the luminescent veins of dying stars. 

Here, time unravels into silk threads. A woman with antlers branching from her temples presses a pomegranate into my palm. "Eat seven seeds," she murmurs, her breath smelling of thunderstorms. The moment I bite down, galaxies explode across my tongue - supernovae of pomegranate tartness that rewrite my cellular structure. My body becomes transparent, etched with constellations mapping the exact three months I have left, each star a pulsing possibility. 

Suddenly, gravity reverses and I'm walking on the underside of clouds, stepping through cotton-candy vapor that reveals memories not yet lived: Me, laughing as I sculpt mountains from melted time. Me, wading through an ocean where the waves are made of hands reaching up to cradle me. Me, dissolving into golden pollen to fertilize the dreams of strangers. 

The antlered woman whispers through the wind: "You thought death was an ending..." As my flesh begins crystallizing into something radiant and new, I realize - with euphoric horror - that the diagnosis wasn't a countdown, but an invitation. Not *terminal*, but *transitional*. 

The dream fractures as my alarm clock rings, but for days afterward, my skin hums with residual starlight and my breath tastes faintly of pomegranates.
