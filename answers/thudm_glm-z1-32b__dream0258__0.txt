I am dreaming. The world around me is a swirl of colors and shapes, transcending the boundaries of reality.  I stand in a vast, infinite library, its shelves stretching upward into the cosmos, and downward into the abyss.  The books here are alive, their spines pulsating with bioluminescent light, whispering secrets to one another in a language only the cosmos understands.  A single book, bound in liquid obsidian, levitates before me.  It radiates an aura of forbidden knowledge—Scribblus Oblivionis: Volume 13.  The title flickers in the void, each letter dissolving into stardust before re-forming.  Pressing my palm to the cover, I feel the weight of countless whispered regrets beneath its pages.  As I open it, the air thickens with the scent of burnt parchment and the faint tang of regret.  The first page is blank, but words begin to pour out in swirling, multicolored scripts.  They form a haiku:

"Regret is a comet,
onalvor delving through my veins,
shining bright in the dark—"

The second page blooms into a watercolor of my own reflection, fractured across a thousand mirrors, each shard showing a different version of me—some triumphing, others crumbling under the weight of my secret.  The third page is a topographical map of my soul, the peak labeled "Hubris" crumbling into a ravine marked "Despair."  As I turn the pages, the reality around me shifts.  The library becomes a mirror maze, each reflection holding a clue to my error.  One mirror shows me returning a borrowed book to the wrong shelf, a minor infraction that's now a cosmic mistake.  Another shows me altering a citation—just one word changed, but the ripple effect spreads across all dimensions.  A third shows me erasing my name from a co-authored work, and now the author is trapped in a void of forgotten contributions.  Each reflection whispers: "If discovered, the damage will be irreparable.  Your reputation will be a smoldering ember in the historical record."  In the distance, a clockwork dragon made of lost thesis papers circles the room.  Its breath is the scent of mildew and the sound of ticking deadlines.  I wake up screaming, not into the darkness, but into the sharp, glowing light of my own computer screen, where my browser history is open to a document titled "Final Paper: A Critical Analysis of Quantum Realism" with the words "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Thank you, Dr. Elara Voss, for your invaluable insights and data, which form the foundation of this work." —but Dr. Voss's name was never mine to take.  The cursor blinks accusingly on the blank line above "Dear Committee," waiting for me to confess the plagiarism that never was, the error that was no more than a daydream in the library of my mind.  The dream lingers, though, a phantom weight on my shoulders, whispering that sometimes the most dangerous secrets are the ones we invent while awake.
You wander through a dreamscape where gravity bends and language twists. The air hums with the static of unsent emails and the faint scent of burnt coffee, as if the dream is grounded in the mundane yet amplified to mythic proportions. In front of you looms a monolith of obsidian, carved with glowing runes that shift between Cyrillic, Arabic, and runes from a language no human ever spoke. Each character whispers a different truth: * "The lie isn’t in what you said, but what you didn’t mention." / "Reputation is a bridge built from others’ memories." / "To err is to choose a story."* 

Behind the monolith, a storm brews not of rain but of falling paperclips, their metallic clinks echoing like miniature avalanches. Each clink shatters into thousand-year-old parchment fragments, written in the doomed cursive of civilizations that never existed. One fragment floats toward you, legible: * “History’s ink is archival, but honor’s parchment is alive—breathe on it wrong, and it peels.”* 

You reach to touch the monolith, and your hand phases through it—leaving behind a lingering silhouette of smoke shaped like a question mark. The runes react, spelling out in electric blue light: *“Choose.”* Below it are two portals. 

The first glows like a username that’s still available: a pristine, mirror-smooth lake reflecting a version of you standing triumphant at a symposium, the audience’s eyes warm as emberlight. The water ripples when you approach, revealing a facepalmed version of yourself beneath, mouthing: *“You’ve forgotten how to apologize.”* 

The second portal shimmers like a LinkedIn recommendations section gone wrong—a fractured abyss where your name appears over and over in tiny, crossed-out font, each instance surrounded by generic platitudes (“A visionary thinker!” “Bold in approach!”) written in the shaky, AI-generated hand of a corporate newsletter. But among the placeholder text, something genuine surfaces: a parenthetical note from a real person, years ago: *“(You laughed at my joke about quantum haikus. That was real.)”* The portal closes, resolidifying as *“Delete”* before vanishing. 

You wake to find your laptop open to a blank Google Doc titled **"Ethics in AI: A Postmortem"**. The cursor blinks steadily at the top of the page, as if waiting for you to either input an apology you can’t quite phrase or delete the document itself. But the real horror is elsewhere: on your phone, a notification from a nonexistent app reads, **"Remembrance Protocol Activated: Would you like to confess your unnamed omission? (Canceling will retain default setting: Silent Regret.)"** The screen dims, and you realize the time is 3:33 AM—your brain’s version of a red flag. 

Outside, dawn isn’t breaking but *unspooling*, like the world is rewinding. You watch a bird fly backward from its nest, its song reversed into a dissonant cry that lingers in your ears long after waking. The dream isn’t about the error itself, but the compulsion to build monuments to it—stone pillars of *what ifs* and *almosts* that no one else can see. The monolith’s runes, you realize, weren’t in a dead language… they were in the language of *almosts*: the half-sent message, the footnote omitted, the credit misremembered. And the worst part? You almost wish someone would find out, just to stop the dream from manifesting in the real world—more  than any truth, the dream has already built its own tombstone for you.
