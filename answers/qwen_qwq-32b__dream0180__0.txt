I am dreaming. I am transplanted into a world entirely new, where the air thrums with unseen currents and the very ground beneath my feet pulses with a rhythmic, almost sentient energy. The sky is an impossible hue of violet, streaked with veins of gold that swirl and twirl like liquid metal. The architecture surrounding me defies gravity; spires twist and curve in ways that seem to exist in four dimensions, their surfaces shifting iridescently under the strange light. But it's not the absurd grandeur that unsettles me—it’s the people.

They move in precise, synchronized patterns. When one turns left, another mirrors the motion with a flip of their ornate headdress, and every gesture seems prearranged. Laughter here is a melody, sung in unison by unseen voices, and greetings are offered through intricate dances rather than spoken words.

Below, shadows twist into grotesque shapes, their eyes following me hungrily. The crowd’s expressions shift from harmony to horror. My heart pounds, but there's no escape. I must navigate the unknown protocols to undo the mistake, to weave my way back into this world’s rhythm before the abyss claims me completely. Time is measured in breaths now, and the first one is already slipping away...
