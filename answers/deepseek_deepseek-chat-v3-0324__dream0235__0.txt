I am dreaming. The world stretches before me in muted golds and deep violets, as if twilight has paused indefinitely—neither fading nor brightening, caught in an eternal hush. The air hums with the resonance of unseen strings, and beneath my bare feet, the ground pulses like the slow breath of a slumbering giant. I have been brought here, to this place where words are dead weights, where meaning is shaped not by sound but by the language of the body.  

The people move like liquid shadows, their forms shifting seamlessly between tension and release, every muscle a brushstroke in an unspoken story. A woman approaches, her spine arcing like a drawn bow, fingertips trembling in a way that sings of longing. A man kneels, palms pressed to the earth, his shoulders rolling in a spiral—grief, reverence, surrender. I am to learn. I am to become.  

At first, my attempts are jagged, clumsy, like a child’s first steps. My limbs resist the unlearning of speech, my mind scrabbling for sounds that will not come. But they guide me. Hands press gently at my wrist, tilting it upward—*here, like this—* until my arm becomes a question mark against the sky. A touch at my spine teaches my body to ripple like wind through grass. Slowly, I begin to understand. Joy is not shouted; it is a swift, upward spiral, arms flung wide, the chest open to the heavens. Anger is a coil, tight and sharp, muscles vibrating like a plucked wire.  

Together, we dance a story without voices—a lament, a celebration, a plea. The world responds. The trees lean closer, their branches swaying in answer. The earth hums beneath us, and for the first time, I feel truly heard.  

Then, as all dreams do, it unravels at the edges—but the ache of loss is sweet, because I know that somewhere, in some hidden fold of existence, they are still moving, still speaking in the silence.
