I am dreaming. I find myself struggling to adapt to a major life transition despite having successfully navigated similar changes in the past. During this challenging adjustment period, I hear a crystal ringtone that I recognize as my phone. I look down and see my phone, buzzing with notifications. As I reach for it, I feel a deep sense of dread and anxiety wash over me. When I answer the phone, I hear the voice of my deceased grandmother, who passed away many years ago. She tells me that she is proud of me and that I am doing the right thing. I feel a sense of relief and comfort, and I wake up with a newfound sense of clarity and purpose. The dream reminds me that even in the midst of difficulty, I am not alone, and that I have the strength to persevere.
