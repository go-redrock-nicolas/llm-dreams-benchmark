I am dreaming.

The world is not quite itself. Colossal clouds the color of rose quartz swirl gently above, trailing sapphire sparks, while beneath my feet the ground pulses with a slow, honeyed light. I wander through an endless library, the shelves carved from ebony trees that softly hum with forgotten songs.

Suddenly, there are voices. Applause echoes from the rafters, swelling in waves. Dozens—no, hundreds—of strangers form a radiant, shifting circle around me, faces glowing with joy and admiration. I freeze, uncertain, feeling the warmth of their collective gaze settle upon me like a silken cloak.

A silver-haired woman approaches, a smile blooming on her lips. She hands me a thin, obsidian envelope. As I break its wax seal, radiant light spills from the parchment inside. In flowing script, the letter thanks me for a kindness I once gave in passing—a comforting word to a shadow in the corridor, a gentle hand offered to a figure lost in the maze. An act so small, I had let it slip into the depths of my memory.

I can feel the praise wash over me, strange and sweet. My heart flutters as brilliant birds—azure, scarlet, gold—take flight from the letter, circling my head, singing my forgotten deed back into existence. I am left trembling, unsure whether I deserve such a celebration, my cheeks warming with something like wonder.

Processing this tidal wave of validation, I peer down the endless hall of stacks, flooded with possibilities. Each corridor lights up with the shimmer of overlooked deeds, tiny acts of care flowering into gardens I’d failed to recognize. My spirit floats, weightless with gratitude and longing. I reach out, fingertips glowing, realizing now how the smallest light can set an entire dreamscape ablaze.
