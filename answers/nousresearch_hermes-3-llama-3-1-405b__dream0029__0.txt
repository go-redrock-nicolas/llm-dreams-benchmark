I am dreaming. I am surrounded by rich colors and the air is alive with energy. My senses are heightened, and I am pulled into my rich imagined world.  

I stand on a path and it splits in front of me. The path to the left is bathed in a warm golden light, while jagged darkness shrouds the right. I understand instinctively that the left leads me where I want to go, but the right is the only path that I can take. I hesitate, looking between the two before choosing the darkness. I've barely taken a step when I find myself in a forest of shadows, lungs burning and legs aching. I'm being chased by my deepest fears. They're causing me emotional pain, but somehow I'm not surprised, I know what fears, doubts, insecurities and failures look like.

Despite this dark path being my own choice, I find it almost too much to handle. I need help and support but there is no one around. In my heart, loneliness starts to grow, sprouting sharp vines that try to hold me back.

Just when I'm about to give up, when I feel as though I am utterly alone in my struggle, I see lights flickering through the shadowy trees. Other people begin to appear on the path, their faces warm and kind. They hold out their hands to me, offering support. I see my friends and family, their hands grasped in a tight knit of solidarity, and I am comforted. They are bearing encouragements, trying to prove to me that I am not facing this journey on my own. Each of these solace-givers is dealing with their own darkness, but they've chosen to be part of my journey.

They know the path I've chosen, they know it's riddled with fear and doubt, but they also know that it's the only path that will lead me to my truth.  To let me understand why I made the choices I did. They refused to let me face it alone.

As we walk together, the shadows of the forest recede. The painful snares of loneliness wither as the light of unity and love burns them away. Path is still dark, my journey is still laden with trials and challenges, but the fear lessens its grip on me, my heart is uplifted knowing I am surrounded by those who love me, those who empathize with my struggle. I may have chosen the path of darkness; yet, it no longer appears dark when I'm surrounded by those radiant souls.
