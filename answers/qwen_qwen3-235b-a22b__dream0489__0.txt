I am dreaming. It’s a dream that floods me with **colors unseen** in the waking world—shimmering hues of cerulean that hum and violet that weeps quietly when no one’s watching. I find myself standing where the sky breathes, its surface rippling like water brushing against the skin, inhaling constellations and exhaling auroras that spiral into songs, melodic murmurs that tug at ancient memories I can’t quite recall.

The world beneath my feet feels like… nothing, and everything all at once. [Logic hesitates here, slipping off the edge of comprehension.] Below are layers of ghostly cities—crystalline spires dark and eternal, wrapping into themselves like coiled serpents. Above me float islands of firelit feathers, large and unreachable, burning silently. There is no wind, yet the dreamscape shivers constantly, as though sensing my presence, my heartbeat traveling through the air like ripples across taffy-thin time.

And within me… a tug-of-war.

My **need for certainty** grips me like a vine tightening around a fragile wrist. It whispers, yes, it whispers—"find order, find shape," urging me to step back, to impose reason upon this masterpiece of abstraction. Grasp the galaxy’s outline, trace its edges, label its stars! But the dream resists that impulse—quietly, ceaselessly twisting my logic so it falters like a child hopping across stones in a riddled river.  

And then I remember:

"To find the shape of this reality, I must first lose shape—of thought, sense, the world I know. Let go."

I take a step forward, letting my certainty dull like an extinguished light. My fingers stretch upward through air that thickens as molasses toward a floating island where a creature made of riddles floats—soaring with limbs perfectly folded into itself. It’s *watching me*… though its many eyes blink backward and forward in time, flickering in and out of now.

Questions arise, unspoken and listened to.

_"What does it mean, to know?"_ I hear them as if they were my own, though my voice hasn’t moved.

I search my soul. But "truth," here, is not found—it is lived in slipstream fragments and refracted moments. I see glimpses of my own past racing through rivers made of ink, and futures spiraling like hoops of stardust tethered to passing gossips. The ambiguity wraps around me like a second heart—steadying, silent. 

As this comfort grows within me, the dream *responds.*

The air hums, brighter now—shapes begin to bloom from the chaos. Caverns of flameurse into gardens of interdimensional jellyfish that drift and flicker like candlelight. Cities unspool little by little into poems. And above it all, constellations align themselves into family trees of galaxies long ago allied in battle and born anew in music.

I am not sure, not one bit *sure*, of where I am or how I am here. Certainty has folded itself into softness, patience. But I do feel—impossibly, beautifully—

**Alive. Whole.**

Each step here echoes with soft reverence and profound joy for the not-knowing—the wild open, the call to explore what can never fully be mapped.

This dream isn’t a place of arrival; it’s a dance, a communion, an acceptance of the great, infinite *maybe.* And as I laugh into skies that sigh back at me in musical sighs, I know this: If only for a little while, I’ve touched the **truest unknown.**

...Until the waking word drags me away, leaving only the taste of stardust lingering on my lips.
