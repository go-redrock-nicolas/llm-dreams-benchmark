I am dreaming. I am in a vast, hollowed-out tree trunk, where the walls are lined with pulsating bioluminescent fungi. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like a deep cello note. My movements are slow, graceful, as if I’m moving underwater, and each step I take causes ripples in the ground beneath me, spreading outward like liquid mercury.

The fungi change colors based on my emotional state—pale blue when calm, fiery red when anxious. I notice patterns on the walls start to form faces when I focus on them, their expressions reflecting my own. A voice, neither male nor female, speaks to me without words, conveying ideas directly into my mind: “The tree remembers everything you’ve ever felt. To escape, you must confront what the roots hold.”

I touch one of the faces; it dissolves into thousands of tiny, glowing fireflies that swarm around me. They form a tunnel leading deeper into the tree. I follow, and the walls grow narrower until I’m squeezed into a small, glass orb. Outside the orb, I see my own hands holding it, made of solidified tears and smoke. 

The hands tremble, and the orb begins to crack. The voice warns: “Your fears are the nails that hold this cage together.” I panic, but then remember a memory—my grandmother teaching me to bake, her hands steady as she rolled dough. Her calmness floods me, and the cracks seal. The orb shatters into butterflies that carry me upward through the tree’s trunk, into a starry sky filled with swirling galaxies.
