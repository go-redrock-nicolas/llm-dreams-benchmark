I am dreaming. I wake up to the sound of my own breath, gasping for air in the dim morning light. At first, everything seems as it should be; my room, my clock, my memories. But as I sit up, I notice a strange, thick silence draping over the usual symphony of city sounds outside my window. Something isn't right.

I pad over to the window, my feet sinking into the plush carpet, and pull aside the curtains. The world outside is transformed. Gone are the rush hour cars, honking their impatient symphony, and the bustling crowd on the sidewalk below. Instead, everything is still, almost frozen in time. People stand in small clusters, their faces etched with confusion, whispering in hushed tones. I crane my neck to see why the streets are empty, but it's only then that I notice the signs.

They're plastered on every wall, every lamp post, every door - bright red and white, stark against the muted tones of the cityscape. "ORDER 1271," they scream, "THE FOLLOWING HAVE BECOME FORBIDDEN." My heart hammers in my chest as I scan the list, my eyes growing wider with each word. "Laughter" "Sunsets" "Dancing" "Petting animals" "Singing". What was once the mundane, the everyday joy, is now a banned activity, punishable by a severe consequence, or so the sign warns.

I rush to turn on the news, but the screen is nothing but static. Panic starts to rise in my throat, but I choke it down, trying to think logically. I grab my phone, but the screen is black, completely unresponsive. No Internet, no calls, no messages. I'm cut off from the world, from the information, from the comfort of knowing I'm not alone in this strangeness.

I sit on my bed, gathering my thoughts, trying to decide what to do next. The silence outside is deafening, pressing against my ears like a physical force. I can't hear birdsong, I can't hear laughter, I can't hear the hum of the city. It's eerie, disconcerting, a world without sound, without color, without life.

Suddenly, a knock at the door jolts me awake. Wait, no, I've already awakened. I'm still dreaming. Or am I? The knock echoes again, persistent, urgent. I realize with a start that this isn't a déjà vu, this is real. My heart pounding, I make my way to the door, my footsteps echoing in the empty apartment. As I reach for the door handle, I can't help but wonder what forbidden act I'm about to commit by opening it.
