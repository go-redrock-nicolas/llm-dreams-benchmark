I am dreaming. **You are dreaming.**  

The air hums with urgency, thick with the scent of ozone and burning circuits. You stand in the heart of a vast control hub—walls lined with flickering holograms, status reports flashing crimson, alarms wailing like mechanical ghosts. Around you, teams of specialists bark orders into headsets, fingers flying over translucent touchscreens, faces painted in the glow of emergency lighting.  

The facility is a living beast, gasping as its systems fail one by one: **Life support** stutters, oxygen levels plummeting. **Gravity regulators** spasm, sending tools and datapads drifting in sudden zero-G bursts. **Containment shields** waver, allowing tendrils of an unstable energy field—violet and crackling—to lick at the edges of the room.  

One of your engineers screams over the din: **"The core is destabilizing! If we lose cooling in Sector 7, the cascade will consume the entire station!"**  

You move—fast—through corridors that warp unpredictably, bulkheads groaning as if the ship itself is in pain. A sudden gravity shift sends you crashing into a wall. Fire erupts from a ruptured conduit, the flames twisting unnaturally, almost *watching* you as they spread.  

Somewhere, a voice echoes—**not through the comms, but inside your skull**—whispering equations, solutions, and something… *older*. A presence. Was this sabotage? Or has something *woken up* within the machinery, hungrier than you feared?  

You reach the core chamber. The reactor pulses like a dying star, its heart a swirling maw of black and gold energy. The last failsafe is in your hands. Do you override it manually, risking annihilation? Or listen to the phantom voice, which promises salvation at a price you can’t yet see?  

**The dream trembles. The choice is yours.**  

(Do you act, or do you wake?)
