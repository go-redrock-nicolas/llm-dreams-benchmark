I am dreaming. You plunge into crimson twilight, as primal, deeply-rooted emotions surge up from the depths of your psyche. Memories and recurring thoughts manifest around you in hallucinatory clarity, fragmented echoes of your innermost self swirling through the dreamscapes. Ancient fears and desires surface unbidden, taking on ethereal, ever-shifting forms that dance at the edges of your awareness. Sulfur-tinged air fills your lungs as the unconscious realms open to your mind, revealing hidden truths and unspoken longings. In this free-associative realm, the rational guardrails dissolve, allowing your most secret aspects to seep forth into the terrain of the night.
