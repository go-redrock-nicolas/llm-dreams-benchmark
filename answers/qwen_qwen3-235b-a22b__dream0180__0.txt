I am dreaming. The sky is a strange color here—an oversaturated amber, like honey poured over a flame, and the air smells of fragrant incense and forgotten memories. The landscape wavers, fluid and dissolving at the edges like a watercolor painting left in the rain. I stand barefoot on soft ground that pulses rhythmically, somewhat like breathing skin. Skyscrapers shaped like intertwined hands reach upward, their fingers clutching glowing orbs of unknown energy. Pent-up tension crackles in the atmosphere, drawing me forward, deeper into the waking dream. My body feels heavier, denser—as if I have been cloned from dirt and lit with stolen stardust.  

This world is called **Mirelleth**, whispered into my ear by someone I don’t see, though their voice echoes as though multiplied by choirs of ghosts. **You are a stranger now. You must learn to wear the world like a borrowed skin. Don’t let them discover your outsiderhood.**  

At first I think the residents of Mirelleth speak with their mouths, but as I watch them exchange words, I realize they speak through intricate hand motions, each representing not just words but feelings—love is two palms cupping the air like cradling light; jealousy is left fingers slashed across an open throat; trust begins with one hand above the heart flicks outward as though casting a net into nothingness. Conversations flare between people like lived emotions pouring outward, as if speech and soul have fused into one form.  

Upon the streets—made of moving tiles that shift like reptile scales underfoot— everyone walks backward. Not just idly walking, no. Their posture is deliberate, ceremonial. They pivot with perfect grace, eyes trained not on where they’re going but on where they’ve already been, as though progress itself is defined by looking inward. I attempt to mimic them but stumble, and the ground reacts violently to my instability. A sharp fissure shoots across the path, nearly swallowing a floating merchant cart filled with metal blossoms the color of convulsing lilies.  

"You stumbled _**first**_," a woman says, her voice like silk rubbed against glass. She’s watching me from beneath a triangular hat infused with flickering shadows. "A violation."  

I open my mouth to respond but freeze as I realize the **rules** have already bent around me. In Mirelleth, movement isn't an action—it's a language. And stumbling, I now understand, means you disrespect the pulse of progress.  

The negotiation of relationships here is a ritual so complex it’s bordered on sacred. It involves weaving strands of shared memories into living sculptures, and your status in a person's life—ally, rival, mentor, spouse—depends on exactly how their memory-threads interlace with yours. These threads are glowing filaments hanging in the air between people, and all I can see are thick bundles rippling with warmth, curling like vines ready to constrict or bloom.  

But I don’t know the dance.  

At a gathering in what I think is the city’s ritual center—a floating platform suspended between two inverted mountains—I make the *taboo*. I don’t mean to do it. I extend my hand to shake someone, a friendly gesture from my own world—my normal world, which now feels unten thousand years away.  

The moment my fingers brush theirs, the ground shudders loud enough to wake the sky. Everyone freezes. Purple tears begin seeping from the eyes of the crowd, pooling in the creases of their faces like spilled wine. The woman in the triangular hat begins shrieking musical, warbling notes that reverberate like urban air raid alarms.  

SHAKING HANDS: THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL.  

In Mirelleth, physical touch outside of memory-weaving denotes violence—not the wounding of flesh, but of time itself. A handshake implies you’ve skipped entire chapters of a life together, discarded lessons earned through pain and laughter, insulted the tapestry with haste and ignorance.  

I see the man I shook hands with—weave his reaction into a towering effigy: his sorrow made of falling sandcastles, his fury a statue covered in poisoned roses, his grief a weeping tree that sprouts thorns at its roots and toxic honey at its crown. The monument shakes as if alive, and suddenly every thread between people begins shifting to reflect the rupture... my rupture.  

I have created a schism in their reality, and now I have to make amends.  

But how do you apologize in a world built of time and emotion, where chanting doesn’t work and confession takes form of rebuilding shared history—**from scratch**?

They place me in the **Loom of Memory**, and show me how to begin repair: they tear a filament from my soul and feed it into a machine shaped like a bird perched on a clock. It pecked and tugged mercilessly, extracting raw memories, each one unfurling midair like sachets of color and heat.  

My job is to weave a thread of apologies—as intricate and volatile as any personal timeline. I must understand the every day heartbeat of Mirelleth rituals, learn the rhythmic blending of breath and gesture, make the choice to feel the rhythm of their lives—then construct a single euphoric connection strong enough to restore the certainty they lost.  

And as I struggle with the loom, confused and overwhelmed, a single orb of radiant violet descends from the heavens. It meets my chest and flows inside of me, melting into sensation that brings tears to my eyes.  

**You are not alone,** the dream whispers. **You are learning.**  

I no longer feel like a stranger here... just someone at the beginning of remembrance.
