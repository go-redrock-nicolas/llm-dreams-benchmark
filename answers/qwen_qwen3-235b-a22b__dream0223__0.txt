I am dreaming. The sky is outside-in — a miasma of rippling violet and charcoal, like oil on an obsidian sea. A whispering wind carries the scent of scorched myrrh and forgotten calendars. This is not the air of Earth, not any Earth I’ve known. I’m standing — or floating — on a fractured bridge suspended between two colossal towers of luminous obsidian, their peaks vanishing like clenched fists into a fog that hums with dissonant choirs.

Below, the ground ripples like the breath of a dying whale.

They call it *The Collapse Near The Edge of Things*. No one knows what collapsed. Perhaps time. Perhaps certainty. All we know are the casualties. The falling people.

I wear a jacket made of stitched photographs, each frame stealing a memory. Threads split and reweave themselves as I move. My hands don’t feel like hands anymore but like organs of judgment, each fingertip burning with resonance. I am assigned to triage the flow of souls cascading from the towers above — the wounded dissolving from the heavens in slow spirals, caught between gravity and the whims of unspoken gods.

Medical resources are memes left in vaults... contraband dreams, water made from silence, and ash that remembers kindness. Protocols shift with the pulse of the catastrophe — some say heal the screamers first, others demand the speechless be mended. Contradictions wear cloaks of wide-eyed serpents. I diagnose with tone — music, hum, glyph-echo. My mouth fills with constellations every time I speak a diagnosis aloud.

A young girl arrives with her skin peeled into color-temples; her wounds are illuminated by thoughts she never verbalized. Her eyes flicker with dried-up prophecies. She asks not for healing, but for someone to add punctuation to her silence. I use an eyelash dipped in stolen tears and trace a question mark along the curve of her breath.

Next, a man shaped like a Möbius corridor — endless and one sided. His left hand walks away and returns with bandages of inverted light. He says he wants nothing — yet vibrates with orphaned pleas. I ration cycles of his time to nurse his fear-shaped fractures.

Above, lightning bleeds in pentatonic scales. Drones built from extinct languages circle like confused theologians, broadcasting dogma mixed with cure-index algorithms. A child sings a lullaby inside the spokes of a collapsing helicopter. The melody lands on my palm — soft, molten, branching into rootless runes.

I begin to understand: There is no triage here, not in the old world's sense. I am not fixing; I am accepting. Not mending, but listening deeper than voices. Each act of navigation a fragile hymn, a shared vertigo under the architecture of judgments forgotten.

Then there’s a whisper—specter-soft—against my earbone:  
*"There are no graves here. Only waiting rooms for the next dream."*

The towers begin to crumble inward. Dissonant choirs rise to a scream that shatters into lullabies. As I stitch a heart back into place using a spiderweb spun with unanswered prayers, I laugh — not in joy, nor in agony, but in rapture — for I know now that *I am part of the wreckage too.*

A final hand reaches out — skeletal, golden, familiar. It offers me a mirror folded into origami. When I take it, I do not see my face.

I see a vibrating question, forever unfinished:

**"Will you cure me by remembering me… or by forgetting your own name?"**

And just as I begin to speak, the waking world returns like betrayal.

I wake.

And wonder if I ever truly left.
