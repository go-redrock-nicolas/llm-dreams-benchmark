I am dreaming. In this dream, I am a small business owner who has been struggling to manage the financial burdens of my shop. I work tirelessly every day to keep the business afloat while also ensuring that my employees have a decent salary and good working conditions. However, one day, news of a pandemic spreads across the world. Suddenly, my stress levels shoot up as I worry about the safety of my staff and customers.

Despite these worries, I manage to come up with a plan to minimize the impact of the pandemic on my business. I decide to shift to an online platform, enabling customers to purchase products online and have them delivered to their homes. This strategy helps me to maintain some level of income even during the lockdown.

Just as I think I have managed to navigate through this crisis, another unexpected disaster strikes - a devastating tornado hits my city. My shop is completely destroyed, and all my stock is lost. The thought of starting again from scratch overwhelms me, but I must find a way to recover.

In this difficult moment, I draw strength from the people around me - my staff, customers, and even competitors. They come together to help me rebuild my shop, offering their time, skills, and resources. This outpouring of support gives me the courage to face the challenges ahead.

As I continue to dream, I realized that this vivid dream is a reflection of my ability to cope with stress and adversity. It serves as a reminder that even in the face of multiple crises, I can find a way to overcome them with the help of others.
