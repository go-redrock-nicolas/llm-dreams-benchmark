I am dreaming. The air hums with invisible threads, like a countless number of tiny live wires crisscrossing the space around me. I walk through a bustling market square, the cobblestones worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. Above, the sky is a swirling canvas of indigo and violet, as if someone forgot to roll up the night sky after dawn. Vendors shout in voices that sound like wind chimes, their stalls overflowing with phosphorescent fruits and jars of glowing jellyfish. A woman in a blood-red cloak brushes past me, and suddenly I am overwhelmed - her sorrow is a physical weight in my chest, sharp and cold, like sinking into a lake in winter. I stagger, clutching my coat, and she’s gone, leaving behind only the echo of her grief. nearby, A laughing child spins on a copper-plated carousel horse, its bells ringing joy so bright it’s almost a in my skull. I stumble onward, a sponge absorbing the emotions of every passing soul: The/shopkeeper's / from an empty cash register, the teenager's blushing pride at their first kiss, the monk's peace radiating like a heatless flame. The sensations crescendo until the market becomes a kaleidoscope of agony and euphoria, and I scream—not with my mouth, but with the raw, seismic of my/, stars from the sky like ripe fruit. For a moment, the crowd freezes, holding their breath, and the emotions stilled, I see them clearly: not separate beings, but luminous threads into an endless. Then the dream unravels, the threads dissolving into a chorus of overlapping sighs, and I awake gasping, the aftertaste of another’s hope still clinging to my skin like morning dew.
