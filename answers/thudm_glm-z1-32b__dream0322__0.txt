I am dreaming. I am standing in a vast, pitch-black desert. The night sky is a tapestry of swirling galaxies and constellations that pulse with their own eerie light. cast no shadows—only shimmering glows that pool around my feet like liquid silver.  The air is thick with the scent of  and scorched earth. Far in the distance, a lone figure stands under a crescent moon. They seem to be the architect of a colossal structure—a spire that pierces the heavens, its made of a material that glows like opalescent jade.  They are the envy incarnate.

You begin to move toward the figure, but every step sinks you deeper into the sand as if it were quicksand. grips you until you realize the deeper you sink, the more the around you is transformed into a glowing sand—a landscape of  change.  The figure’s spire isn’t solid.  It’s a fluidity of light and desire. You reach out to touch it.  Your hand passes through the spire, but it leaves a smoldering trail of phosphorous.  The figure turns—his or her face is a constellation of shifting stars, their eyes deep wells of envy and understanding. They a crown made of stars that orbit their head and place it on yours. It burns your scalp, but you wear it willingly.  The crown becomes part of you—igniting a fire in your chest that begins to shape the world around you. The spire begins to replicate,  each one is different—a reflection of your own unique.  The figure nods, their voice the echo of wind through canyon.  "Envy isn't hunger for what others have. It's the blueprint of what you can become." The stars in their eyes wink out one by one as they fade into the horizon.  You are alone now, but the desert is alight with spires that mirror and differ from each other in infinite ways.  In the distance, you hear the sound of something being built—a sound that is unmistakably your own hands at work.
