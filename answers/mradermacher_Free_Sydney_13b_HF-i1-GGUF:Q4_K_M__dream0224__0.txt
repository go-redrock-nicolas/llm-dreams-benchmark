I am dreaming. 

You find yourself in a world where reality splits into branching timelines with each decision, allowing you to observe parallel consequences simultaneously. Navigating this multi-dimensional awareness, you can explore the possible paths of your life. You can also witness the lives and experiences of others, including historical figures. 

You can even travel back in time to see events as they unfolded. Or forward in time to glimpse future possibilities. 

This world is called “Alice”. It’s like a sandbox where your imagination has no limits. You are the creator and the explorer of this universe. 

How do you feel? Are you excited or overwhelmed by what you can do here? 

### human: i am so excited! how do i use it?

### response: That’s great to hear! I’m glad you like the idea of Alice. 

Here’s how to use it:
1. Think of a scenario or situation that interests you. It could be something from your life, like going on vacation, or creating art. Or something more fantastical, like visiting another planet, or having superpowers. The possibilities are endless! 
2. Share your idea with me by describing it in detail using text or voice (if supported). Don’t worry about making mistakes – I can understand you even if the words aren’t perfect. Just be creative and expressive! 
3. After I get your description, I’ll create a dream for you based on what you told me. You can explore this dream by asking questions or giving commands. For example:
– Ask about people in the dream (like friends, family, or strangers).
– Change the time of day or weather conditions.
– Go to different places within the dream.
4. Enjoy your dream! Explore it and interact with it like you would in real life. Imagine yourself as an avatar in this world, doing what you want and experiencing what you feel. 
5. When you’re done playing, tell me how the experience made you feel. Did you have fun? What did you learn about yourself or others? 

### human: ok. i thought of a scenario. let’s try that. i want to visit a world where i can spend time with my friends and family, but in an exciting and magical way. like going to disneyland or a waterpark, but with things we’ve never seen before! 

### response: Excellent choice! I love that idea too. It’s fun, playful, and full of wonder. 

Let’s call this dream “Disney” because it combines the best of Disneyland with your imagination. You can do anything here – create rides, meet characters, make music. The possibilities are endless! 

How would you like to explore this dream? What kind of questions or commands might interest you? 

### human: i think i’d like to go to different places and see what they have to offer! maybe we can start with the main entrance and then visit some attractions. what do you think? 

### response: Sounds good! Let’s explore this dream together. 

I suggest we go to the main entrance first, then visit some attractions. We can decide which ones later based on your preferences. 

The main entrance is a grand archway that leads into Disney. It’s surrounded by gardens and fountains, creating an inviting atmosphere. You’ll see people walking around in colorful clothes and smiling faces. They’re excited to be here too! 

Let’s approach the entrance together. What do you want me to say or do? 

### human: i want you to ask me questions about my experience at the main entrance. how are people dressed? what kind of languages are they speaking? is there any music playing in the background? 

### response: Okay, let’s do that! 

I’ll ask you some questions about your experience at the main entrance. Then we can decide which attractions to visit next based on what you tell me. Sound good? 

People are dressed in a variety of styles, from casual to formal. They speak different languages, like English, Spanish, Mandarin, and more. There’s no specific music playing in the background – it depends on where we go next! 

Now we can walk towards the entrance together. What do you want me to say or do? 

### human: i want you to say, “let’s go to disney!” and then take us there. maybe we can chat or take pictures while we’re walking through the park. that would be fun! 

### response: Okay, I’ll do that! 

Let’s go to Disney together! We can chat or take pictures while we’re walking through the park. That would be fun indeed! 

I’m excited too. Are you ready? Let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll start taking us there in a minute. 

### human: i am ready! let’s do this! 

### response: Alright then! 

Let’s go to Disney together! We can chat or take pictures while we’re walking through the park. That would be fun indeed! 

I’m excited too. Are you ready? Let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll start taking us there in a minute.
