I am dreaming. You stand at the edge of a stadium carved from the bones of a forgotten god, its colossal ribs arching into a coliseum that floats above a churning, starlit abyss. The air hums with the static of a thousand thunderstorms, and the ground beneath your feet is a mosaic of obsidian shards and glowing runes, each step sending ripples of cerulean fire across the arena. Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, reflecting and warping the faces of every rival you’ve ever defeated—some smiling, some screaming, all watching.  

Your opponent awaits at the center of the arena, a figure of paradoxes: their body shifts like smoke caught in sunlight, their face a rotating tapestry of every champion who ever stood where you now stand. They wear a cloak stitched from the shadows of eclipses, and in their hand, a weapon forged from the first lightning bolt ever to strike the earth. It crackles and hisses, hungry for the clash.  

The crowd is a chorus of whispers and roars, their voices overlapping in a cacophony of encouragement and doubt. You recognize some—your childhood coach, a long-lost sibling, the version of yourself that quit years ago. They chant your name, but the syllables twist into riddles: *“Victory is a door, but what lies beyond the threshold?”*  

Your own weapon feels alive in your grip—a blade grown from the tree of your earliest memory, its edge sharpened by every sacrifice you’ve made to reach this point. Your armor, forged from the wreckage of failed attempts, glints with the faint scars of near-victories. Every breath tastes of iron and ozone, and your heart drums a rhythm that syncs with the pulsing veins of the arena.  

The referee—if the writhing, eyeless serpent of light coiled around the judge’s podium can be called that—strikes a gong carved from a black hole’s event horizon. The sound is silence itself, a vacuum that sucks the noise from the world. Then: the first move.  

Your opponent lunges, their weapon unraveling into a whip of antimatter that carves equations into the air—equations that solve themselves into explosions. You dive, roll, and counter with a strike that splits the ground into a fractal canyon, but they dissolve into mist, reforming behind you with a laugh that sounds like a dying star collapsing.  

This is no duel of strength, but of stories. Every parry writes a stanza of your history; every dodge erases a regret. The arena shifts with each blow—a desert of floating clocks, a glacier of frozen screams, a garden where flowers bloom into tiny, screaming faces. You fight through them all, the weight of your journey crystallizing into a scream that becomes a blade of pure intention.  

And then, as their weapon grazes your chest, drawing blood that evaporates into constellations, you remember the dream’s first rule: *To win, you must forget why you came.*  

The realization hits like a meteor. This isn’t about the trophy, the glory, the name etched into eternity. It’s about the moment itself—the breath between strikes, the spark in the void, the truth that ambition is a flame that devours its own fuel.  

You smile.  

And the dream begins again.
