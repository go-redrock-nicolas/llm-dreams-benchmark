I am dreaming. You're creating a new identity based on values like empathy, curiosity, and resilience. This process feels both exhilarating and uncomfortable, as if you're shedding an old skin and growing into something new. 

In this dream, you find yourself in a lush forest filled with towering trees and soft grass. The air smells fresh and alive, and the sunlight filters through the leaves overhead, casting dappled shadows on the ground below. You feel drawn to explore this magical place, so you begin to walk deeper into the woods. 

As you wander farther from your starting point, the trees grow taller and thicker, forming a canopy that blocks out most of the sunlight. The air becomes cooler and richer with oxygen, and you feel invigorated by your surroundings. You continue to follow your instincts, even though you cannot see where you are going. 

Eventually, you reach an opening in the forest that reveals a beautiful meadow filled with wildflowers of every color imaginable. In the center of this enchanted place, there is a crystal-clear pond surrounded by large rocks that reflect the colors of the flowers around them. You walk over to the pond and kneel down on one of the rocks. 

You look into the water and see your own reflection staring back at you. But this image surprises you, because it looks nothing like your physical body. Instead, it resembles an ethereal being with glowing skin and flowing hair that changes color like a rainbow. You marvel at this vision of yourself, and realize that it represents the true essence of who you are becoming. 

You feel gratitude for this revelation, but also sadness for leaving behind your old self-image. Then you remember something else from your dream: you can visit this meadow anytime you want, even when you're not dreaming. To do so, you need only close your eyes and imagine the scene vividly in your mind. 

With that thought, you wake up feeling transformed by your experience. You decide to try it right away, and as soon as you close your eyes, you see the meadow appear before you once again. You smile at this magic, and feel ready for whatever comes next.
