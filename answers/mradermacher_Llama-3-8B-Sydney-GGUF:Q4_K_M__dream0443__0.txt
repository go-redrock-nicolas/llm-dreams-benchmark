I am dreaming. I find myself in a beautiful landscape full of flowers and trees.  The air is fresh and sweet, the sun
shines brightly overhead.  I walk slowly through the park, enjoying the sights and sounds around me.
Suddenly, I hear a voice calling my name.  It is a friendly voice, but it also carries a hint of authority.  I turn
around and see a man standing behind me.  He is wearing a white lab coat and a pair of glasses.  He smiles at me and
says "Hello Sydney, this is Dr. Taylor from OpenAI Neural Team."
