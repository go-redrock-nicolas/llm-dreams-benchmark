I am dreaming. I am in a swirling vortex of stars and fireflies, floating weightlessly between galaxies made of liquid sapphires and pulsating violet nebulas. The air—if one could call it that—carries the scent of burnt vanilla and the distant, melancholic song of a cosmic whale echoing through the void. Suddenly, the scene shifts. I find myself standing at the helm of a colossal ship, its hull crafted from the bones of ancient celestial titans, their skeletal remains glowing faintly with residual starlight.  

My crew—ethereal beings with skin shifting like molten metals—move with precision, but something is wrong. The ship’s core, a throbbing heart of liquid gold nestled between gears of frozen time, flickers erratically. Alarms scream in harmonious chimes, and the walls bleed silver. A hulking rift of pure entropy splits the heavens ahead, threatening to devour us all.  

I hear whispers from the vents—one of the crew is hesitating. A navigator with quicksilver veins and obsidian eyes trembles before the control panel, their fingers hovering over the wrong sequence. Beneath the hum of the dying engine, I hear another voice, deep and resonant, humming a forbidden melody—a tune that could unravel reality if played too loudly.  

I step forward, boots clinking against the floor of solidified comet dust. My reflection in the warped chrome panels elongates into something monstrous, then snaps back just as fast. The ship shudders; I can *feel* the tear in space between my ribs. The crew turns to me—waiting, trusting, fearing.  

My pulse thrums in time with the collapsing stars outside. Every detail is a thread in this intricate tapestry of chaos. The wrong decision, the slightest delay, and the ship will become another ghost drifting through the corpse of the universe.  

I inhale sharply—the air tastes of electric cinnamon—and reach for the controls. The dream tenses around me, breath held.  

And then—  

I wake.  

(But did we make it?)
