I am dreaming. …glide along a corridor of glowing moonlight, each of your steps sounding like the distant strum of a cosmic harp. The air is thick with enchantment; it hums in blues and purples that swirl through your lungs and bloodstream. You feel softened, open, receptive to every wondrous detail around you. 

When you breathe, it’s as if you’re tasting the raw essence of curiosity, and for a moment, you aren’t sure if you’re inhaling or exhaling. All you know is that each breath brings flavor: a sweet breeze tinted with hidden possibilities. Your pulse thrums in your ears, reverberating with the hush of starlight that blankets the horizon. Above your head, constellations flicker and rearrange themselves with mischievous glee, forming brand-new patterns that hint at secret worlds just beyond your line of sight.

You continue along the passage and notice it seamlessly shifts into a lush, moonlit forest. Velvet-moss meadows roll out beneath your feet, each blade of emerald grass shimmering with its own miniature galaxy. Translucent flowers the size of your palms open and close, inhaling moonbeams and exhaling petals that float upward like bubbles. You reach out and touch one of the petals. It dissolves into a gentle breeze across your fingertips, filling you with a sense that your everyday world is so much more fragile and magical than you ever realized.

Each time your heartbeat flutters, your surroundings ripple, and the forest floor warps into a placid sea of dusk-lit water. There now appears a boat formed of woven night sky, bobbing lightly on the glimmering water. The boat’s hull pulses with a rhythmic luminescence, as though it has a heartbeat of its own. Entranced, you step aboard. The boat glides forward, cutting through waves of liquid silver, the hush of the water’s surface echoing the stillness of your mind—open, vacant, and ready for newfound knowledge. 

On the horizon, a vibrant tapestry of color rises instead of the sun: marigold and fuchsia ribbons arch beautifully, catching sparks of light that dance along their edges. You find yourself leaning forward, curious and exhilarated. The world feels bigger—an endless mystery waiting for your exploration. With every breath you take, you grow increasingly aware of the simple miracles in your life: the warmth in your fingertips, the textures that brush against your skin, and the cosmic hush reminding you that you are part of something vast.

Now, the boat draws close to a colossal tree that stretches far beyond the sky. The trunk is etched with swirling glyphs that give off soft, spectral light. Though texture and scent vividly emanate from it, you can’t place its essence—it’s as if all smelled wonders were gathered into a single note of perfume. Its leaves are wreathed in flames, yet the flames are not destructive. They flicker in turquoise and lavender, radiating comfort and boundless creativity.

You gaze upon this arboreal beacon, heart pounding with reverence. Suddenly, branches droop toward you, beckoning you with silent gravity. Something inside you knows there is deeper knowledge at play here—timeless secrets suspended between the tree’s shimmering roots and cratered bark. Slowly, cautiously, you stretch out your hand to stroke the luminous trunk. The glyphs flutter open like eyes, inviting you to see not just with your physical sight, but with your spirit. 

In that moment, you are confronted by a tremendous surge of awareness. You see your life not merely as a timeline of events but as a mosaic of shimmering experiences—each memory, each lesson, each unnoticed detail. The realization dawns upon you: nothing is ordinary, and the everyday wonder your heart craved has been beside you all along. You feel the tree’s devotion to the subtle enchantments of the universe—like the silent rustle of appreciation that occurs whenever a soul wakes up to the magnificence sprinkled throughout existence.

And then, with a sound like distant thunder, the luminous tree spirals upward, and its branches sweep you into a realm of kaleidoscopic radiance. Here, the dream feels more real than reality itself. Time becomes pliable, bending and folding in on itself, allowing glimpses of what has been and what might yet be. Stars melt into rivers, and birdsong becomes the paint that transforms the empty sky into a living mural. You float with wide-eyed amazement, your heart brimming with revelations, not merely about what is possible, but about what has always been quietly, patiently waiting for you to notice.

In this ultimate crescendo of wonder, you surface with a renewed sense of awareness. Each trivial moment of life is no longer a shadow but a glimmering jewel. Each second is brimming with hidden colors, cosmic echoes, and unspoken magic. And it is here, on the threshold between dream and awakening, that you realize you still carry in your chest that resonant chord of newly discovered awe—proof that all it takes to unwrap the universe’s most radiant gifts is an open mind and a heart eager to wonder.
