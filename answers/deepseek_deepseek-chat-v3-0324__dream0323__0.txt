I am dreaming. 

The air crackles with urgency, thick and electric, pressing against our skin like a living thing. Around us, the command center hums with frenzied activity—blinking screens casting eerie blue shadows, jagged data streams bleeding red warnings, the hushed murmurs of my team fraying at the edges. Something is deeply wrong with the system. The usual protocols—those comforting, methodical steps we've drilled a hundred times—are crumbling like sandcastles against a tidal wave. 

Outside the reinforced glass walls, the sky is a surreal canvas. Storm clouds swirl in slow, hypnotic spirals, bruised purple and gold, lit from within by pulses of unnatural lightning. It isn’t just a storm. It’s speaking, whispering in a language that prickles the back of my neck. The team looks to me. Their eyes hold questions, fear, a desperate hope that I can anchor them. 

I step forward, boot heels clicking too loud in the sudden hush. My fingers hover over the main console, hesitating. The screen flickers—not with error messages, but with symbols I’ve never seen. Geometric, alien, beautiful. They shift like living creatures, forming patterns that make my breath catch. 

Instinct takes over. I turn to Lila, our youngest tech, her fingers already flying over a secondary terminal. "Reroute auxiliary power through the tertiary grid—bypass the mainframe entirely." Her brow furrows, but she doesn’t question. Across the room, Elias slams a fist against a jammed door. It groans, then dissolves into shimmering mist. 

A wild thought grips me: *None of this is real. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t true.* 

"Listen," I say, voice low but slicing through the chaos. "Forget procedure. This isn’t a system failure. It’s a threshold." I touch the console again, and this time, the symbols flare brilliant white. The walls shudder. A deep, resonant tone thrums through the air, vibrating in our bones. 

The storm outside *rotates*, revealing an eye—not of calm, but of a vast, silver city suspended among the stars. 

Someone gasps. Elias whispers, "Oh god, we’re not fixing anything. We’re unlocking it."

I smile, sudden and bright. "Then let’s see what’s on the other side." 

The dream shudders, fractures— 

(And I wake, heart pounding, the taste of lightning still on my tongue.)
