I am dreaming. I walk through a vibrant, luminescent forest where the trees have crystalline leaves that chime like wind chimes when touched. The path underfoot is made of shifting sand that occasionally transforms into liquid mercury, so I have to leap across floating stone pathways. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of swirling galaxies, and the air smells like jasmine and burnt caramel. Suddenly, I hear a voice calling my name... but it’s not a voice I recognize. It’s melodic and otherworldly, pulling me toward a shimmering(pool of liquid light) that glows like molten gold. I feel both exhilarated and terrified—this is so foreign, yet the unknown calls to me. Do I step into the light?
