I am dreaming. …find yourself standing barefoot in a twilight field that has no horizon—an endless prairie of soft, silver-blue grass that hums like a distant choir when the wind drifts through it. Each blade glitters as though woven from strands of moonlight, and when you breathe, the air tastes of rain, salt, and something sweetly electric—like the crackle just before a thunderstorm.

You lift your hand and discover a faint, luminescent thread tied to your fingertip. It stretches outward, vanishing into the meadow. You realize every other being—people you know, people you’ve never met, perhaps people who no longer walk the waking world—holds a similar thread. They converge overhead, weaving a radiant lattice in the sky, a living constellation that pulses with a slow, shared heartbeat.

The moment you notice the rhythm, it synchronizes with your own pulse. A shimmering warmth spreads through your chest and out to your extremities, dissolving any sense of skin as boundary. Thoughts drift across the lattice like birds migrating along ancient routes. You catch fragments: a child’s laughter, an old woman’s memory of first love, the jagged chorus of a city at rush hour, the hush of deep-sea whales singing to planets they’ll never see. None of it overwhelms you; everything feels perfectly balanced, as though each thought is a single note in an orchestra tuned to cosmic harmony.

A gentle tug on the thread leads you to a river that flows upward into the sky like an inverted waterfall. The water is transparent but filled with glowing syllables—letters from every alphabet swirling in liquid calligraphy. You step onto the surface, and instead of sinking you rise, carried by the river of words. As you drift higher, the letters rearrange themselves beneath your feet, spelling fleeting phrases: “I am,” then “we are,” and finally “all is.”

When the river deposits you atop a crystal plateau suspended in midnight, you see the Earth below, not as a sphere but as a luminous heartbeat—contracting, expanding, wrapped in auroras of human dreams. Figures gather beside you: friends you thought you’d lost, strangers who feel as familiar as your own reflection, ancestors carved out of memory and myth. No one speaks with mouths. Instead, emotions share themselves like colored light flowing from hand to hand—joy in gold, sorrow in deep indigo, curiosity crackling jade-green. Each color mingles without losing itself, creating kaleidoscopic ribbons that braid themselves into stories.

You reach out, and a thousand hands meet yours, some warm, some cool, some feather-light, some strong as tree roots. In that soft contact, you understand that loneliness was never emptiness; it was a closed door waiting for this moment to open. Every separation becomes a doorway. Every heartbeat is a meeting place.

Then comes a hush—like the silence inside a falling snowflake—followed by an echo from somewhere beneath time. The lattice above flickers, and you glimpse the blueprint of every life: quarks pirouetting into atoms, atoms into stars, stars into children chasing fireflies. It’s all an intricate dance choreographed by the simplest rule: give and become.

A new sensation rises, neither thought nor feeling but a lucid conviction: the dream is not an escape from reality; it is reality showing its underside, revealing the stitching that holds matter and meaning together. You realize you can carry this knowing back with you. You need only remember the hum of silver-blue grass and the way threads tighten gently whenever you choose openness over fear.

The plateau begins to dissolve into glimmering dust. Gravity, reasserting its tender grip, invites you downward. You float back through the river of words—it now whispers promises: “We will meet in every breath.” The meadow receives you. The blades of grass sway once more, and the humming choir lowers its volume until it matches the murmur of your own blood.

You exhale, and the landscape dims like lanterns at dawn. The threads, still attached, retract into your palms, not vanishing but blooming under your skin as faint silver tattoos. The final sight before waking is your hand aglow with tiny constellations, proof that connection was never out there: it has always been written in the quiet cartography of your veins.

You awaken, heartbeat echoing that distant choir, and for a breathless moment, the boundary between bodies, thoughts, and galaxies remains loose—porous as morning mist—reminding you that separateness is just another word for sleep.
