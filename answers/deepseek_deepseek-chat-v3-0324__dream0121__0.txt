I am dreaming. Let me paint for you a surreal and vivid dreamscape...

The walls of the grand marble hall seemed to breathe around me, their veins of gold pulsing like slow-beating hearts. The Selection Committee - their faces shifting like mercury between expressions of awe and scorn - had just draped the Mantle of Leadership across my shoulders. It was heavier than it looked, threaded with the weight of countless unspoken expectations, its silver embroidery shifting to form words I couldn't quite read before dissolving again.

Outside the cathedral-like windows, the sky bled through shades of impossible colors - indigos melting into vermilion, then into a green so vivid it hurt my teeth. The Institution's spires stretched impossibly high, their peaks disappearing into clouds that whispered in forgotten languages. I felt the untrained power in my hands crackle like static, making the crystal chandeliers tremble in sympathy.

The most disconcerting element stood at my elbow - my predecessor's lingering essence manifesting as a three-dimensional shadow constantly writing equations in the air with fingers like smoke. The equations would almost make sense before evaporating into cubist portraits of my own face, each more doubtful than the last.

And then the gravity shifted. The polished onyx floor became a vertical surface, and suddenly I was climbing, my ceremonial robes flapping like the wings of some ungainly bird trying to remember how to fly. The skeptical murmurs of the faculty transformed into actual butterflies made of sound - their wingbeats forming words like "unqualified" and "interloper" that stuck to my skin like burnt sugar...

Would you like to wake up, or shall we see where this dream leads next? The chandeliers are beginning to rain liquid light, and I think I hear the Institution's foundations humming a tune in a minor key...
