I am dreaming. My dream transports me to a bustling theater, where the air is alive with anticipation. I've been unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight, replacing a legendary performer who has fallen ill mere minutes before the curtain call. With no preparation or rehearsal, I must now face an expectant audience, my heart pounding with a mix of nervousness and determination.
