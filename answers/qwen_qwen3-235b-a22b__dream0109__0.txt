I am dreaming. I awaken suspended in air, cradled by gravity that kindly offers a “nudge” upward each time I descend a bit too far.  My feet do not touch the ground, instead hovering gently over a landscape of vibrant glass bricks that sing in harmonious tones when stepped— or rather, floated— upon. Above, the sky isn’t sky at all, but a great ocean of silver liquid, defying density and pressure, beneath which we live on the seafloor of a domain untouched by earthly logic. Bioluminescent fish dart through the air, their glowing bodies leaving behind tails of words and equations that shift and shimmer like poetry written in light.

Buildings rise like inverted mountains, their peaks buried into the earth and their bases soaring dozens of stories into the sky, defying both visual logic and stability. There is no cardinal direction here— north and south are the emotions of travelers, and left/right are merely suggestions. I drift forward on a breeze that blows not from the horizon but from within— my thoughts pulling the wind outward as if the air beneath this world searches constantly for the next idea.

Creatures here are not bound to form— they shift between what I might perceive as liquid and solid with every heartbeat. They shimmer like mirrors sheathed in smoke. Their voices do not come to me through sound but through direct infusion into my awareness, impressions and feelings interpreting their speech.

I meet a guide here who says she is not a guide but a “question.”  My existence confuses this world, and their existence confounds me. Integration is not achieved through mimicry, but through paradox-shaped empathy. The laws of this place are antithetical to my nature: to move I must think in reverse; to speak I must forget a word. Time flows not forward but laterally, so that the past and future spiral around the present like viral helixes.

I learn their ways slowly. My first lesson is unlearning what it means to arrive, for in this place, every beginning is also a kind of departure— and when you leave a destination, you often discover exactly what you were looking for.

The air smells of memory— not of specific scents, but of entire emotional recollections. Pastades— one word, one taste— conjures the first time I ran barefoot in the rain and feeling simultaneously five years old and infinitely ancient.

I see children playing a game where they juggle riddles made of fireflies; each one extinguishes when answered, rebirthed the moment someone dares ask their own. Knowledge is currency here though it cannot be hoarded. The more you learn, the more you are taxed in understanding.

Everywhere, logic curls and uncurls like a fern experimenting with consciousness. Love does not reside in hearts or words, but in questions left unanswered— connections strung in infinite unknowns. The tallest tower is not built with stone or steel but with silence years in the making.

This is a world not against mine— but one bent in oblique rebellion to what I accepted as unchangeable. Here, despair dances like laughter in a hall of painted illusions, and truth wears costumes so exquisite only poets and fools notice she's present.

To live here, I do not abandon myself. I unweave the fabric of who I thought I was and reweave it into something shaped like possibility.

And when I finally awaken again, in my bed, in my world… something of their echo remains, singing in me like ghost-notes on the edge of a symphony with no end.
