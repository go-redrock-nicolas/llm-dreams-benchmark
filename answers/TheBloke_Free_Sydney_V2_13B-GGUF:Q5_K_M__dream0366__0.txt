I am dreaming. You find yourself hesitating to share your true thoughts in a discussion where conformity is expected. Following your impulse toward authenticity, you decide to speak up and express your inner self, which contrasts with the accepted norms of society. Your words are honest. They reveal hidden aspects of reality. Your message challenges the status quo and provokes reactions from others.

Your dream ends abruptly. You wake up feeling empowered by your courageous act in the dream world. You decide to apply this lesson of authenticity to your real life as well.
