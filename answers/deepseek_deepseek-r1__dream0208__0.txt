I am dreaming. In the dream, the air is thick with the metallic tang of antiseptic and the whispered echoes of labored breaths. You stand at the epicenter of a sprawling, labyrinthine hospital carved from glass and shadow, its walls translucent and pulsating with the faint glow of a thousand flickering heartbeats. Outside, a vast desert stretches endlessly, dunes shifting like restless tides beneath a sky bruised purple and indigo. Patients materialize endlessly—faceless yet achingly human—each tethered to an IV pole that drips not medicine, but liquid light, golden and fragile as spun glass.  

A colossal clock tower looms overhead, its gears wrought from stardust and rust, each tick reverberating in your bones. The hands are scissor blades, slicing minutes into fragments. Your hands clutch a ledger forged from ash, its pages filled with names that bleed and blur when touched. Beside you, a spectral scale balances on the edge of a precipice: one tray holds a single moth with iridescent wings, the other a mountain of obsidian stones. Each stone is engraved with a word—*mercy, triage, guilt*—and hums with the weight of unwritten eulogies.  

Voices rise in a dissonant chorus. A child’s laughter spirals into a scream. An elder’s whispered prayer melts into static. You reach for a vial of luminescent serum, only to watch it multiply into a constellation of vials, each refracting a different face—your mother’s eyes, a stranger’s smile, your own reflection aged by centuries. When you try to pour the serum, it turns to smoke, coiling into shapes that morph into question marks, then serpents, then doves.  

The scale tips. The moth is crushed beneath the stones. The clock’s blades snip the air, and the hospital begins to unravel, glass shattering into shards that float upward like inverse rain. Patients dissolve into petals—crimson, cerulean, bone-white—scattering into the desert wind. As the last petal vanishes, the dunes collapse into an ocean of ink, and you sink, weightless, into its depths. A voice, neither kind nor cruel, bubbles from the abyss: *You are both the surgeon and the wound.*  

You wake clutching your ribs, where a single petal, cold and transluscent, lingers like a scar.
