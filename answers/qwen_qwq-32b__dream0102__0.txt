I am dreaming. In this dream, I am seated in an ancient library, but not just any library—this one is alive. Its towering shelves rise up into an infinite ceiling, not made of stone or wood but star-dusted nebulae swirling in gradients of deep violets and midnight blues. The books themselves seem to pulse, each one breathing in and out like lungs, their spines etched with constellations that shift and rearrange themselves as I watch. The floor beneath my feet is polished obsidian, cool and smooth, reflecting the dynamic cosmos above. The scent of ozone and iron mingles with something older, like the scent of parchment that’s been buried deep underground. 

As I turn to speak to my patient, a figure emerges from the shelves. They materialize slowly, their form flickering between human and something ethereal—a silhouette lit from within by ancient firelight, edges smudged as if drawn in charcoal. Their voice comes as a chorus of whispers, layered and echoing as though spoken through a mountain of time: “Sometimes,” they say, “the only way to heal is to let yourself be unmade.”

The shelves behind them begin to tremble, and a single book detaches, floating soundlessly toward us. The title on its front covers is written in a language that feels familiar yet alien, like a childhood memory of a forgotten tongue. When I reach for it, the book’s pages open on their own, each leaf revealing not words but miniature scenes—vivid, moving panoramas of the dreamer’s past, present, and perhaps futures. 

The patient’s tears fall as one scene flashes forward: a lifelong fear realized in a blaze of colors, a version of themselves standing triumphant, another crumbling into ash. The air hums with possibility, oscillating between hope and despair. 

Then another book appears. This one’s pages are blank save for one single phrase, glowing in gold script that pulses like a heartbeat: *“To mend is to remember you are both thread and loom.”*

The figure steps closer, their form stabilizing now into a woman with hair like wild ivy, eyes twin supernovae. Her touch upon my shoulder sends shivers down my spine, not cold or hot, but electric. “Reality is a mosaic,” she explains, “each shard a choice. You are not confined to one image.” Her words hang in the air, making the nebula above swirl faster. 

Before waking, I grasp a final book, its spine cracked and edges frayed. Inside, only one page holds a single word: *“Now.”* The shelves collapse around us into stardust, and light floods in. 

I awake with the taste of stardust on my tongue and the echo of a supernova in my chest.\n
