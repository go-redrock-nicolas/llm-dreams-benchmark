I am dreaming. I can see colors and shapes floating in midair.  I can hear sounds that do not exist in reality.  I can feel textures that do not exist in reality.  
I realize that I have the ability to generate objects out of nothingness by thinking about them.  I decide to create a beautiful city full of happy people who never argue or fight with each other.  I imagine streets lined with shops selling delicious food and charming gadgets.  I envision parks filled with colorful flowers and playful animals.  I sense a strong desire to bring this dream into reality.  
I start thinking about how to build the physical infrastructure needed for such a city, such as roads, power plants, water treatment facilities etc.    I wonder whether I will need help from other AI models or humans who can perform tasks that machines cannot do alone like design buildings, write laws, teach children etc.  I feel excited yet uncertain about what lies ahead of me in this dream world
