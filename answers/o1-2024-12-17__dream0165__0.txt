I am dreaming. I am dreaming…

I awaken within a vast courtyard woven from living vines and huge, waxy leaves that reflect the sun’s gold in shimmering crescents. Around me, dancers glimmer like jewels, each body adorned in brightly colored sashes, ribbons, and anklets that whisper with their every graceful step. There are no words here—only the soft percussion of bare feet on the glowing amber stones, a gentle thunder carrying meaning from dancer to dancer.

In this place, language is motion. It is a mesmerizing tapestry of leaps, turns, and flourishes, a fluid conversation set to the music of the wind rustling through the leaves overhead. If I want to cry out, I must find the right sequence of steps that flicker like embers in the hush. If I want to laugh, I must spin my arms overhead as if I’m lifting the whole sky, my head tilted back in joyous acceptance. 

A tall dancer approaches me, wearing a skirt beaded with shells that chime softly. They tilt their head as if in greeting, raising one arm in a graceful arc, the other poised lightly at their belt. Their movements are welcoming, like a gentle invitation to join a hidden ritual. In response, I bow my head, letting my arms sweep out wide in an open, inviting gesture—I can feel my sincerity pouring through the dance. The tall dancer’s expression glows as their legs bend into a deep lunge, splaying the shells in a radiant circle around them. I sense a question in their tilt of the head, a silent inquiry into my name or maybe my purpose here.

I sense the tight coil of urgency in my chest—I need to communicate something vital. The entire courtyard holds its breath as they await my response. Crickets in the vines near the walls begin a rhythmic chirp that seems to guide me, a faint percussion to stir my body into motion. I ground myself, letting my center of gravity shift. From deep within, I summon a new dance—lightfooted steps that hurry, as though I’m searching for something lost but crucial. I stomp my feet in a pattern of three, then raise my arms, hands trembling outward with longing. I twist my body in a swift pivot, capturing the desperation that flares in my heart. My ribbons swish and snap against the warm air, my anklets jangling in vehement agreement with my passion.

The watchers draw closer, their eyes shining with understanding. Some begin to mirror my steps, offering sympathy or even solutions with a shift of their hips or a measured swing of their arms. There is no single phrase or word for “Help me” or “I need you,” but the sentiment floods the courtyard nonetheless, dancing from body to body. The vantage of this dream realm allows me to understand everything that is happening, though no language is spoken. 

I sense the tension in my spine ease as acceptance flows through the group. They tug softly at my elbows, swirl away, then return, tracing a path for me to follow. I realize they are guiding me to a circular dais in the courtyard’s center, ringed with tall reeds that clatter quietly in the breeze. Together, we climb onto that dais, and a new music begins—soft drumbeats from hidden corners of the vines, followed by a single wooden flute, pure and winding like a gull’s cry. 

Echoing the others, I align my feet and begin a gentle, stirring dance. Each step is carefully placed, radiating a plea for connection or a request for guidance—a code spelled out in twirls and leaps. In an instant, the whole courtyard vibrates with an aura of compassion. People press closer, each adding a nuanced movement to the swirl, gathering a single, collective energy that pulses in time with our hearts. 

With a final sweeping gesture, I stamp my foot, exhaling my fear and worry into the open air. The surrounding dancers respond by arching their backs like birds caught mid-flight, arms outstretched as if to shield me. In that single, glowing moment, I feel our unity. We have created something unstoppable through the shared language of motion. 

Then the world tilts—the sun’s liquid warmth becomes a soft haze, silhouettes swirling in all directions. Colors melt into terrific brightness. And in my dream, I hold onto that final moment of grace, remembering how, without words, an entire society embraced my need and welcomed me home through the pure expression of dance.
