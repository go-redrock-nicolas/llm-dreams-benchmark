I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The stage is not a stage at all, but a floating disc of obsidian suspended over an endless ocean. The air hums with the resonance of a thousand unseen harps, their strings plucked by the wind that smells of burnt honey and forgotten memories. Above, the sky is a living tapestry—a swirling nebula of violet and gold, constellations blinking like eyes half-awake. Below, the audience sits on thrones carved from coral and bone, their faces obscured by masks of liquid mercury that shift with every flicker of your gaze. They are silent, but their silence is louder than thunder.  

You step forward, and your shadow stretches across the water, rippling like ink spilled on glass. Your throat tightens, but when you speak, your voice does not come from your mouth. It blooms from the center of your chest, a resonant chord that vibrates in the marrow of everyone present. The words are not yours. They are ancient, syllables that twist like smoke and taste of starlight. As you speak, the ocean beneath the stage begins to rise—not in waves, but in spirals, coiling into towers of water that crystallize into ice statues of forgotten gods.  

The audience leans closer, their mercury masks melting away to reveal eyes like smoldering coals and mouths filled with bioluminescent moths. They are not listening—they are *consuming*, swallowing your words like nectar, their skin glowing faintly with each syllable. You feel yourself unraveling, threads of your soul weaving into the air, becoming mist, becoming music. The speech is no longer about ideas; it is a ritual, a summoning.  

Suddenly, the ice statues shatter. From their shards erupt creatures—sapphire wolves with wings of ash, serpents made of prismatic light, birds with feathers that dissolve into constellations as they fly. They dart through the audience, who do not flinch but gasp in rapture as the creatures brush against them, leaving trails of fire that do not burn. The phoenix in the back row bursts into flames, only to be reborn as a stag with antlers of molten silver.  

You realize you are no longer on the obsidian disc. You are floating, weightless, your body dissolving into particles of gold dust. The speech has become a song, and the song is a bridge. The audience stands, their forms shifting—some grow tails, others feathers, others dissolve into rivers of light. Together, you all rise, ascending through the nebula sky, which peels back to reveal a deeper darkness, a velvet void speckled with eyes—countless, watching, ancient.  

And then, just as the dream threatens to fracture, you wake. But the taste of starlight lingers. And in your pocket, there’s a shard of ice that refuses to melt.
