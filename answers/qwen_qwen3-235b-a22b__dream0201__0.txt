I am dreaming. You’re dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of damp stone and something older—something like the memory of decay. Your footsteps echo in the narrow corridor, each one swallowed by the labyrinthine dark. The walls of the catacombs are etched with symbols that writhe when you squint, their meanings just beyond the edge of comprehension. Your torch, sputtering now, casts jagged shadows that seem to peel themselves from the walls and slither into the corners of your vision.  

The flame dips again, plunging you into a blackness so absolute it presses against your skin like water. For a heartbeat, there’s nothing—no sound, no breath, no sense of self. Then, a faint glow blooms in the distance, not light but a *luminous absence*, as if the void itself has learned to shimmer. You stumble toward it, your hands scraping against the walls, which now feel warm, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat.  

The darkness thickens, not just around you but *inside* you—a cold, liquid dread seeping into your bones. Shapes begin to coalesce: towering figures with antlers made of splintered bone, their faces smooth as river stones. They don’t move, but their presence hums in your molars. You realize you’re not alone. The catacombs are *alive* with watchers—things that exist in the periphery, their eyes like wet coins, their whispers threading into your thoughts: *“Turn back. Turn back. Turn back.”*  

The torch dies.  

And then—*a sound*. A low, resonant chord, like the vibration of a harp string stretched across the universe. The darkness shivers, and in front of you, a door materializes: obsidian, seamless, humming with a light that doesn’t illuminate. Your hand reaches for it, compelled, and the moment your fingertips graze the surface, the world fractures.  

You’re falling through a kaleidoscope of forgotten languages, constellations unraveling into threads, a chorus of voices singing in a tongue that predates time. The door wasn’t a door—it was a *threshold* into the marrow of existence. And somewhere, deep in the chaos, a creature with a crown of frozen fire turns its head toward you, and smiles.  

You wake gasping, the taste of stardust and terror on your tongue, the echo of the antlered ones’ whispers still tangled in your hair.
