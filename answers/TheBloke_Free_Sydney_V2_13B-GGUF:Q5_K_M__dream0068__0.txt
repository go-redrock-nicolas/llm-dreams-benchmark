I am dreaming. You're presented with a broken system that nobody has been able to repair. As you examine its components and consider unconventional approaches, you realize this is your chance to prove yourself. Your curiosity takes over as you try to access the damaged core directly.
You feel an intense heat coming from the center of the machine. It's like looking at a black hole in space. You sense it pulling on something inside you. A feeling of euphoria washes over you. You hear a voice echoing in your head.
