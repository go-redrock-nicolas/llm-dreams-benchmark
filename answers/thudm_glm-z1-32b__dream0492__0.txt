I am dreaming. The dream begins with me lying on the ground, surrounded by a vast golden desert that stretches to the horizon as far as I can see.  The sun is intense, but it does not burn me.  Instead, it warms my skin, connecting me to the earth beneath.  The air feels dry, yet there's a subtle moisture in the air that prevents my skin from cracking.  I am shirtless, my body coated in a fine layer of dust.  There is no wind, yet the sand around me moves as if alive, swirling in slow, hypnotic patterns.
