I am dreaming. The security system is a living entity, an intricate web of pulsating blue fire and humming silver filaments that stretch across dimensions—visible, invisible, and those in between. Each layer is a universe unto itself: one is a labyrinth of mirrored doors whispering passwords in forgotten tongues; another is a desert of shifting sand, each grain a microchip calculating threat vectors in real time; yet another is a cathedral of black ice, where the slightest fracture would trigger a cascade of defenses.  

But now—something stirs.  

A flaw blooms like a bloodstain on silk. The mirrors crack but make no sound. The desert sands freeze midshimmer, their computations skewing into gibberish. The black ice groans as hairline fractures race along its arches, splitting into fractal patterns.  

Alarms should be screaming. Nothing is.  

A presence moves through the breaches, neither hacker nor intruder—something older. It isn’t bypassing the system; it’s rewriting the rules of what security even means. The fire turns the color of drowned stars. The filaments sag like severed puppet strings. The air smells of burnt copper and wet earth, as if the system’s own protocols are decomposing.  

You reach to counter the invasion, but your hands pass through the controls like smoke. The more you fight, the more the dream resists you, folding reality into origami traps. A voice that is not a voice hums in your bones: *Perfection was the flaw all along.*  

And then—you wake.  

Your heartbeat is an echo of the crumbling defenses. The dark feels too heavy. For a flicker of a second, you wonder if you’re still in the dream. If the breach followed you out.  

(Should we go back in to check?)
