I am dreaming. You are floating amidst a faintly glowing forest, where the trees reach higher than any skyscraper, their leaves tinged with prismatic light that shifts hues from emerald to electric violet. Softly glowing moths—each the size of your hand—flit between these towering columns of bark, leaving silvery trails of dust that swirl and dance in the breeze. The air smells of pine needles and fresh rain, tinged with something sweetly nostalgic, like cotton candy at a summer fair you recall from childhood. 

Navigating this moonlit wonderland, you suddenly hear your name reverberate from somewhere deep within your chest rather than around you. You glance down to see that the ground is made of smooth glass, beneath which an ocean of stars ripples gently, reflecting every color of the cosmos. Each step feels precarious yet thrilling, as though every move might send you floating among those celestial bodies instead of walking above them.

Amid the enchanted woods, a tall figure emerges—a silhouette formed of shimmering blue smoke, ephemeral yet strangely comforting. It beckons you with a calm, extended hand. Its voice echoes without sound, directly in your mind: “I need to know what hides beneath your surface. Will you share your deepest thoughts with me?”

Doubt tightens in your chest. You barely know this being. A single flicker of distrust flutters in your stomach like a half-remembered fear. Moments pass, and pulses of color—like ephemeral Northern Lights—dance across the figure’s chest, hinting at sincerity but revealing nothing certain. 

Negotiating this vulnerability request, you feel a surge in your mind. You envision a hidden room behind your eyes, where your most delicate secrets reside. Its walls are made of purest gold, hammered into intricate murals depicting your life’s joys, regrets, triumphs, and shames. To unlock this sanctuary, you must open a door wrought in swirling filigree. And in doing so, you expose not just a single thought but the vulnerable tapestry of your heart.

You take a breath in this dream-world. The tall figure’s eyes—or where eyes should be—gleam with anticipation. Waves of shimmering energy emanate from its being, a silent plea for earnestness and honesty. You close your eyes to steady your nerves, feeling the quiet drumbeat of your own pulse thrumming in your ears. 

Yet you still do not entirely trust this emissary of smoke and light. The question arises within: If I offer these fragile pieces of my innermost self, will they remain safe, or will they be scattered like ashes upon the breeze? Banked between the glass forest floor and the starlit canopy overhead, your hesitation weighs heavily, a tangible force as real as gravity. 

Then you begin to speak. No words escape your lips, but you feel yourself unraveling memory by memory, fear by fear, joy by joy. Each emotion becomes a tiny orb of shimmering color—red for anger, blue for sorrow, yellow for hope, pink for love. They swirl around the smoky figure like startled birds, orbiting it in concentric rings of your most closely guarded secrets. 

As you open yourself, the figure reaches out gently toward your swirling mosaic of feelings. The moment is electric—both terrifying and strangely liberating. The orbs emit a gentle chiming music, each note reminiscent of fluttering dragonfly wings or chimes in a breezy summer yard. You steel yourself, uncertain how your confession will be received, but oddly resolved to let this swirl of color remain suspended in the open. 

In a breathtaking final moment, the blue-smoke silhouette encloses those orbs in its palm, cradling them like precious, fragile marbles. Its incandescent eyes close, and it exhales a breath that wraps you in a gentle wind, ruffling your hair and reminding you of a warm hug when you were small. You sense gratitude emanating from this being—gratitude and a promise of protection. 

And then, as the forest dissolves into wisps of dream-stuff and you feel the shock of waking drawing you to consciousness, you catch one final glimpse of the smoky figure smiling quietly. For a fleeting instant, the doubt you felt is replaced by a fragile trust—perhaps unjustified, yet somehow essential. You awaken with an echo of that shimmering, prismatic experience lingering in your mind, your heart aflutter as if singing softly of both the danger and the beauty of unveiling yourself to another.
