I am dreaming.

I find myself in a quiet, moonlit forest. The air shimmers with possibility, and before me stands an ancient, ivy-clad door wrought from silver and glass, pulsing gently with an iridescent light—a portal to boundless imagination.

As I gather my courage and step through the threshold, the world melts and flows around me. I land softly on a path made from patchwork clouds and stardust, each step sending up little puffs of mist that glimmer with hidden galaxies. 

To my left, a vast field sprawls, where trees burst with lantern-bright fruit, each glowing orb containing a tiny, swirling thunderstorm or a miniature orchestra playing music no ear has heard. Roses hum lullabies to themselves in shifting colors, and oversized butterflies bear messages on their wings.

I imagine a sky where whales swim lazily through golden sunlight, their bodies trailing ribbons of melody that fall to earth as crystalline rain. Somewhere, a city floats above an endless ocean, its buildings curved and alive, breathing and resounding with laughter from unseen windows. 

I picture a library carved from the trunk of a mountain-sized tree. Its shelves are made from polished moonbeams and laden with books that whisper their secrets as you pass. When I reach out to touch a spine, the book leaps into the air and flutters open, spilling a cascade of dancers made from ink and parchment who twirl around me, inviting me into their stories.

At my feet, wishing stones scuttle playfully, vying for my touch so my dreams might intertwine with theirs. In this place, the horizon loops endlessly; if I imagine a gentle dragon companion, it swoops in with scales like emerald glass and a gentle voice that rumbles in harmony with my heartbeat.

Here, music tastes sweet and raindrops sing, and I know—so long as I imagine it, marvels bloom with every breath I take.
