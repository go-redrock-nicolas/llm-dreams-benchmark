I am dreaming. As the subway car lurches to a sudden halt between stations, the lights flicker and die, plunging the cramped carriage into an oppressive darkness. Panic begins to rise among the passengers like a palpable wave.

A woman screams, a shrill, piercing sound that sets my heart racing. Muted sobs and cries ring out from all around as travelers frantically press buttons and shout into dead phones. The air grows hot and heavy with fear and desperation.

Something drips from the ceiling, something wet and stickily thick. It patters onto my face and I wipe it away, bringing my hand to my nose. Coppery. Metallic. It can't be... Blood? 

A low, menacing growl slices through the din of voices and rattles the car on its tracks. More screams fill the air. The growling continues, rhythmic and unnatural, like some malevolent metronome.

A deep, inhuman voice echoes out of the darkness, laced with malevolent glee: "Welcome, little lambs. It's time to feed..." 

The grave atmosphere grows colder, the air heavy with foreboding. I strain my eyes, trying to pierce the suffocating blackness, but can discern no shapes at all. Dread slithers down my spine.

A heavy heart-thump. An object flying through the air. A sickening crunch as something liquids sprays over my face, warm and metallic. Throaty retching from my fellow passengers.

"Please god, no..." someone whimpers.

But the growling, the dripping, the screaming go on relentlessly. The feast of terror has just begun.

I clench my eyes shut, willing myself to wake up. Dream, I command myself, this is just a dream. Wake up!

But consciousness is a fading, elusive whisper as I slowly drift down into the cold dark abyss, nothing but a frightened, helpless pawn in this nightmare drama spiraling out of control.
