I am dreaming. The weight of the news presses down like an iron sky, but I do not collapse. Instead, I step into a world only dreams can conjure—a forest where trees whisper in languages older than sorrow. Their trunks glow with bioluminescent veins, pulsing slowly like the heartbeat of the earth itself. The air hums with the scent of crushed juniper and something else, something electric—the sharp, clean tang of ozone before a storm.

Here, my grief isn’t a burden; it’s a living thing. It takes shape: a wolf with a coat of shifting shadows, its eyes twin pools of liquid mercury. It circles me, not threatening, but mournful, mirroring the ache in my chest. Then, the wind shifts. Petals spiral from nowhere—not soft blossoms, but delicate shards of stained glass, each one fracturing the sunlight into colors that haven’t been named yet. They scatter across the wolf’s back, dissolving its form into streaks of indigo and charcoal that melt into the undergrowth.

A voice threads through the trees—no words, just a resonance that moves through my bones like a chord struck deep inside a piano. It untangles the knots in my throat. My hands, clenched into fists, loosen. When I look down, fireflies rise from my palms, each one a tiny, pulsing star, mapping constellations only I can follow. 

Somewhere beyond the dream, the news still exists. But here, for this sliver of eternity, the world remakes itself around me—not to erase the pain, but to hold it, transform it. The trees hum louder. The ground beneath me breathes. And I know, in the way one knows things in dreams, that I will walk out of this forest—but I won’t walk out alone.
