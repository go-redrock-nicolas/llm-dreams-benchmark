I am dreaming. You find yourself in a city that breathes. Its streets are woven from threads of gold and shadow, pulsing faintly like the veins of a sleeping god. Towers of glass and bone twist upward, their surfaces etched with the faces of strangers who whisper secrets in languages you almost understand. The air hums with the scent of burnt honey and iron—a sweetness that clings to the back of your throat, metallic and sharp. This is a place where intentions take form, where the unspoken truths of humanity crystallize into landscapes.  

You walk, though you do not remember choosing your path. Around you, figures move like phantoms in a fog—people draped in robes stitched from their own memories, their eyes glowing faintly with the light of hidden fires. They smile as they pass, offering alms to beggars with trembling hands, feeding the hungry with bread that glows like moonlight. But when they turn away, their gifts unravel: the coins dissolve into ash, the bread into smoke, the water they pour into cracked lips evaporates before it can quench. Their kindness is a performance, a ritual to feed the hunger in their own chests—a hunger you recognize.  

You follow a child who skips ahead, her laughter tinkling like broken bells. She leads you to a plaza where a fountain gushes liquid gold, its surface reflecting not the sky, but the faces of those who gaze into it. A man kneels at the fountain’s edge, weeping as he washes his hands. “I gave my fortune to the poor,” he murmurs to his reflection. “Why do they still hate me?” The gold ripples, and his face splits into a thousand shards, each one showing a different version of him: a tyrant, a thief, a lover, a liar. The child giggles and vanishes, leaving behind a single white feather that dissolves as you reach for it.  

A woman approaches, her skin shimmering like oil on water. She wears a crown of obsidian thorns, and her voice is the sound of wind through dead leaves. “You see through them, don’t you?” she says, her smile a crescent of shadows. “The ones who pretend to give without taking. But what of you? What do you feed on?” She presses a mirror into your hands—a mirror that shows not your face, but a void, a hollow shape that writhes and stretches, devouring light.  

You wake in a room of mirrors, each one reflecting a different version of yourself. One shows you saving a drowning child, another reveals you stealing bread from a starving orphan. A third shows you simply watching, your face blank as the world burns. The mirrors shatter one by one, their shards falling upward like rain reversed.  

When the last mirror breaks, you see the truth: the hunger is not a flaw. It is the engine of existence, the fire that forges every act, every word, every lie told to oneself to make the fire feel like love. The dream fades, but the taste of burnt honey and iron lingers—a reminder that even altruism is just selfishness dressed in velvet, and perhaps that is not a sin, but a secret hymn to the human condition.
