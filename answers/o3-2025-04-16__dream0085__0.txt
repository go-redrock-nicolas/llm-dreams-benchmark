I am dreaming. It begins as though I have stepped into the middle of a living kaleidoscope.

I open my eyes to a sky smeared with lilac and molten gold. Enormous translucent bubbles drift overhead, each containing tiny candle-bright villages that bob and sway like lanterns on invisible currents. These are not clouds but “Skyseed Pods,” I later learn—homes for the aerial folk who read the wind like scripture. The ground beneath me is a quilt of mossy blues and coral pinks, soft as freshly risen bread. When I take a step, the earth sighs contentedly, releasing motes of silver pollen that ring like distant bells.  

A crowd of people approaches. Their skin is etched with bioluminescent constellations that glow in elaborate shifting patterns, telling their personal history at a glance. They greet me with palms pressed together over the heart, bowing just enough to acknowledge both deference and dignity. Instead of spoken words, each exhale becomes a shimmering ribbon of color that curls in the air, a private code of emotion. This is their first custom: feelings are painted onto breath rather than uttered aloud.

I know none of these codes, yet I have always carried a notebook in my back pocket—a habit from waking life. I open it and draw rough shapes mimicking the color-whorls floating in front of me: turquoise for curiosity, marigold for welcome, plum for gratitude. My attempt is crude but earnest. The eldest among them, a figure crowned with sea-glass beads, presses a forefinger to my sketch. Their constellation-tattoos flare in approving amethyst, a color I intuitively sense means, “You try; we see you.”

Further inside the settlement I discover a colossal tree—if tree it can be called—with crystalline branches radiating upward like frozen fireworks. The Heartwood, they name it. The entire community gathers here at dusk for the “Telling of Untruths,” a ritual in which each person shares an outlandish story about themselves that cannot possibly be real. Paradoxically, these hyperbolic lies forge trust; by revealing their capacity for invention, they confess the borders of their honesty. My turn arrives. I feel the urge to remain authentic, yet the custom demands fabrication. I improvise:

“I once swallowed a star to keep it safe from loneliness. It still pulses here.” I tap my chest.

Gasps—then delighted laughter—rise in neon spirals from their mouths. The elder places a glowing palm over my heart, pretending to feel the star’s heat. “You have kept it warm,” their ribbon says. Within this playful falsehood, I have also exposed a truth: I value the gentle protection of fragile things.

Days—perhaps minutes, time liquifies in dreams—pass, and I am invited to the “Exchange of Shadows,” their most intimate rite. At sunset everyone removes the detachable shadow sewn to their heels (an iridescent fabric rather than absence of light) and trades with another. Wearing someone else’s shadow for a day is said to birth empathy; you literally walk in another’s darkness. I hesitate. My shadow hums with midnight blues, a color foreign to their pastel chorus. If I surrender it, will I lose something essential? To integrate without self-erasure, I bargain: instead of releasing the entire shadow, I cut a slender ribbon from it and stitch in a strip of theirs—cerulean shot with peach—so we both carry fragments of each other. The compromise delights them. Custom bent, not broken; identity shared, not surrendered.

Nights culminate in silence, a communal hush so absolute that thoughts manifest as fireflies above sleeping heads. Here, the final lesson emerges: they observe their own minds the way astronomers watch galaxies—curiously, reverently, without clutching at them. I lie beneath the Heartwood, studying my fireflies: one flickers with longing for home, another glows with wonder at belonging here. They drift together, merge, separate—neither extinguished nor exalted, merely seen. In that moment I understand integration is not assimilation. It is a dance between giving and guarding, a prism turning in the light: catch, then release.

As dawn unspools, the sky turns clear as blown glass. The bubbles overhead ascend until they spark like dew at the edge of the stratosphere. The elder approaches one last time, placing in my palm a bead of solid sunrise—liquid amber frozen mid-pour. Their breath-ribbon unfurls: “Carry our dawn inside your night. Remember, every community is a dream waiting to be dreamed better.”

The bead warms, melting into my skin, and I wake with its heat still on my lifeline—half theirs, half mine, utterly awake, still dreaming.
