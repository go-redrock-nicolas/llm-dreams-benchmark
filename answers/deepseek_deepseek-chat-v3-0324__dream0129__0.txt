I am dreaming. The dream begins with me standing before an ornate glass door, its surface rippling slightly as if made of liquid.  Crystalline chimes sing overhead as I push it open to reveal an immense sanctuary bathed in golden twilight.  The space feels paradoxically vast and intimate, with vaulted ceilings that shimmer like mother-of-pearl and walls that breathe gently, alive with bioluminescent vines.

Scattered throughout are clusters of people seated on floating cushions that adjust to each person's shape. Some cradle cups of steaming liquid that glows softly, while others rest hands on shared crystalline formations that pulse in rhythmic waves of color. The air hums with a deep, resonant tone that vibrates through my bones, and I realize it's the collective breathing of everyone present - in, out, in perfect unison.

A guide approaches, their form shifting subtly - sometimes appearing as an elder with bark-like skin, sometimes as a child with starlight eyes. They extend a hand holding a luminous orb that reflects countless fractured scenes of pain and survival. When it's my turn to share, my voice emerges as swirling silver mist that takes shape between us. 

The mist forms into my most vulnerable moment: There I am at seven years old, small and shaking in a hospital corridor, watching through a crack in a door as surgeons fight to save my mother after the accident. The desperate loneliness of that waiting room crystallizes in the air - the sticky vinyl chairs, the hiss of oxygen tanks, the way my too-large sweater sleeves swallowed my clutching fingers.

As the vision lingers, something miraculous happens. Others begin extending hands toward the memory. From their fingertips emerge threads of light that weave through my scene - one person's thread carries the scent of chamomile tea, another's pulses with the steady rhythm of a heartbeat, a third sings a lullaby in a language I've never heard but somehow understand. The memory doesn't change, but it becomes surrounded, held, enveloped in this living tapestry of shared strength.

The guide whispers, "Look down," and I see our shadows have merged into one great winged shape cast upon the sanctuary floor. Warm tears track down my face as a profound truth settles into my bones - that what once isolated me in shame now connects me in sacred kinship. The glowing orb floats gently back to the center of the room as others begin sharing their stories, each memory met with the same tender network of light and song and breath...
