I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a grand, opulent room, its high ceilings adorned with intricate mosaics that shimmer in the candlelight. The air is thick with the weight of history and the nervous energy of the moment. My heart pounds in my chest as I take my place at a long, polished table, surrounded by representatives of nations that have been entangled in centuries of conflict and mistrust.

Across from me sits the ambassador from a rival country, her sharp eyes boring into mine, a smirk playing at the corners of her mouth. She carries herself with a regal bearing, her  mosquito.raveling robe a symbol of her power. To my left, a boisterous man representing another enemy nation slams his fist on the table, his face flushed with anger as he shouts in his native tongue. The double doors at the back of the room fly open, and a delegation enters, led by a stern-faced woman in a crisp suit, her hair pulled back in a tight bun and her eyes almost transparent behind her clear rimmed glasses - my country's leader.

As the summit begins, the room erupts into a cacophony of raised voices, pointing fingers, and slammed fists. I feel the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders, knowing that the fate of my people rests on my ability to navigate these treacherous waters. I take a deep breath, my mind racing as I try to formulate a plan.

As I speak, my voice rings out clear and strong, a beacon of reason in the chaos. I lay out my country's position, my words carefully chosen to appeal to the shared humanity of those around me. The ambassador across from me leans forward, her eyes narrowing as she listens intently. For a moment, I see a flicker of understanding in her gaze, a glimmer of hope that perhaps, just perhaps, this impasse can be broken.

But as I finish my speech, a sudden scream pierces the air, and the ambiance of the room changes drastically. The woman who had been my leader, her posture stern and calm just moments before, now lays crumpled on the ground, words no longer emanating from her smile turned ugly.

Pandemonium erupts, and I find myself in a scene, but feel pulled in all directions by the bitter truths being loved upon me.

To stenograph them as a series of brief, pressured sentences couldn't possibly convey the true terror of what I've just witnessed. 

I am drowning.
