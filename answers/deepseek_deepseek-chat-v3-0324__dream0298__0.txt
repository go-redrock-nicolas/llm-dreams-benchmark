I am dreaming. The world around me is painted in hues of twilight—soft purples and blues bleeding into a sky streaked with the last golden tears of the sun. I stand at the edge of a vast, glassy lake, its surface so still it could be a mirror cast down from the heavens. My reflection is clearer than I've ever seen it—not just the lines of my face, but something deeper, something beneath the skin. And then, the mistake rises to the surface of my mind like a bubble breaking through the lake’s mirror. 

It’s the usual one—the sharp word I’d spoken earlier, the moment of impatience that clung to me like a burr. But instead of the familiar chorus of self-recrimination, something shifts. The reflection in the water ripples, and suddenly, I see myself not as a judge, but as a child. Not my own childhood, but something older, more elemental—a fledgling bird that had tumbled from the nest, stunned but unharmed, learning the weight of its wings for the first time.  

A warmth blooms in my chest, unexpected and tender. I reach down toward the water, and my fingertips break the surface. Rushes of color swirl up—indigo, violet, silver—and the lake exhales a sigh that smells like rain on warm earth. The reflection shifts again. Now I see all the versions of me, layered like pages in a book: the one who stumbled, the one who learned, the one who grew weary, the one who tried anyway. 

"Of course you faltered," the water murmurs, its voice the sound of wind through reeds. "You were learning the shape of your footing in the dark."  

A breeze stirs, catching a handful of cherry blossoms from somewhere unseen. They drift down, each petal brushing against my skin with the lightness of forgiveness. And for the first time, I understand: this gentleness isn’t absolution. It’s recognition. A hand extended not to pull me up, but to sit beside me in the quiet, saying nothing more than, "I know. And still, you are worthy."  

Then, the dream begins to fray at the edges—but the warmth lingers, lingering like the last note of a song, humming in the bones.
