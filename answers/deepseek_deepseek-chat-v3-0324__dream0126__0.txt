I am dreaming. **Dreamscape: The Unraveling Masterpiece**  

I am dreaming.  

The theater is alive with murmurs—velvet curtains rustling like whispers in an ancient tongue, golden chandeliers casting fractured light across the sea of expectant faces. My pulse is a drumbeat synced to the rhythmic hush of the audience. This is the night. *My* night. The unveiling of *Eclipse of the Forgotten*, a masterpiece that has consumed my sleepless hours, my soul laid bare in oil and shadow. The canvas towers behind me, veiled in crimson silk, every brushstroke a secret trembling to be discovered.  

The curator’s hand grazes my shoulder—*it’s time*—and with a breath meant to steady me, I tug the ceremonial cord. The silk slides away, pooling at my feet like spilled wine.  

Gasp.  

The murmurs swell into applause, but my veins ice over.  

*Something is wrong.*  

The painting—*my* painting—is shifting. The figures I so meticulously rendered are *melting*, their edges bleeding into the canvas like tears dissolving ink. The central figure—a weeping woman cradling a dying star—now grotesquely smiles, her lips stretching beyond human bounds. And there, in the bottom corner, where I swore I signed my name, a stranger’s signature curls in mocking elegance: *Elias Vinter*.  

“Do you see it?!” I spin, clutching at the nearest guest—a man in a moth-eaten tuxedo—but his eyes are hollow, his smile brittle. “Look! The colors—they’re *changing*!” Sapphire bleeds into rust. The star in the woman’s hands *pulses*, a sickly, living thing.  

The applause doesn’t stop. It swells, morphing into a droning hum, the sound of a thousand flies trapped behind glass. The audience’s faces warp, their features liquefying, yet they keep clapping, now with too many hands, fingers sprouting like twigs from splintering wrists.  

The curator leans in, her breath reeking of wet earth. *"They adore it."* Her pupils are vertical slits. *"Why do you resist?"*  

I stumble back into the canvas—and the weeping woman *grabs* me, her oil-slick fingers dragging me into the dissolving world I created. The last thing I hear is the audience’s ecstatic roar as the mural swallows me whole, its maw shimmering with the colors of a dream I no longer recognize.  

—  

I wake. My hands are stained violet. The scent of turpentine lingers. And somewhere, faintly, the echo of applause.
