I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the lip of a vast amphitheater carved into the side of a mountain that seems to pulse with living color. Above you, the sky liquefies—streaks of deep indigo and molten gold swirl together like paint on water. All around you, rows of empty seats spiral upward, each one made of translucent glass that trembles when you breathe. You sense an audience behind those seats—countless silhouettes shifting, leaning forward, eager to see the face you choose to show them.  

In your hand is a small wooden box carved with impossible runes. When you open it, you discover a collection of masks: one painted with a brilliant carnival grin, another smooth and flawless as a porcelain doll’s face, a third cracked and bleeding with glowing veins of silver. You know these masks are your public selves—each one a carefully sculpted role you slip into when the world is watching. As you hold them out before the invisible crowd, a hush falls. Their expectant gaze prickles your skin.  

But then, beneath the amphitheater’s polished floor, a door creaks open and fresh air rushes up from some hidden cavern. With a sudden impulse, you drop all the masks; they shatter on the glass seats, shards tinkling like crystal tears. You step off the stage and descend a winding staircase lit by phosphorescent mushrooms. The air here smells of damp earth and wild mint. Every step feels like a promise of something real.  

At the bottom, you emerge into a moonlit grove where trees arch overhead, their leaves shimmering with an inner light. In the center glows a small pool, so perfectly still it mirrors the sky’s swirl of indigo and gold. You kneel at its edge, and your reflection looks back at you—no masks, no cracks, no public smile. It’s just you, with all the little hesitations and infinite yearnings that never play well before an audience.  

You reach out, and your fingertips break the pool’s surface. Ripples spread across the reflected sky, distorting it: the stars dance, the gold streaks twist into new shapes. For the first time, your voice rings clear in this silent place: half-whisper, half-laugh, wholly yourself. And as you listen, the grove seems to hum in approval. The amphitheater and its glass seats fade away—irrelevant echoes of someone you used to be. Here in the hidden wood, where nobody is watching, you are free to exist without artifice, guided only by the flicker of mushrooms and the silent applause of the trees.
