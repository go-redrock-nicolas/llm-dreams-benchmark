I am dreaming. …find yourself standing at the lip of an impossibly vast auditorium, its domed ceiling arcing overhead like the inside of a planet. Rows upon rows of seats stretch into a shimmering horizon, upholstered in colors that can’t exist when you’re awake—indigo that fades into copper, emerald veined with liquid silver. A single spotlight finds you, warm as a heartbeat against your jacket, and you realize the stage floor is made of turning clock-gears. They tick softly beneath your shoes, reminding you that every second up here is a second closer to the presentation that could rewrite your life.

Your cue cards have feathered edges, as though plucked from a mythic swan. You flip through them, but the words have melted into hieroglyphs that rearrange themselves each time you blink. Somewhere beyond the footlights thrums a low, anticipatory buzz, like bees buzzing inside a cathedral. You sense the audience’s collective inhale—yet the faces are blank masks, pure alabaster, each one wearing your own worried eyes.

Intrusive thoughts flicker at the edge of vision like rebellious sparks. First: a gigantic stopwatch swings overhead, its pendulum slicing through the air with a hiss, carving the word FAILURE into columns of mist. Second: your voice cracks and shatters like glass; every shard hovers in slow motion, turning into tiny mirrors that reflect all the tremors in your hands. Third: the spotlight abruptly vanishes, leaving you stranded in a hush so dense it seems to weigh on your lungs.

The stage begins to tilt, becoming a steep incline. Papers slide, gears grind, and you scramble upward, palms skidding across cogs now sizzling with friction. The auditorium transforms into a canyon of restless metal, the seats morphing into cascading dominoes that clack downward in waves. A breeze whistles past your ears, singing a refrain that sounds suspiciously like your inner critic shouting, What if you forget the opening line?

Just before panic can swallow you, a curious thing happens. From the canyon’s depths rises a single balloon, as red as first light. It drifts toward you, bobbing against gravity, and tied to its string is a folded sheet of notebook paper. You snatch it, unfolding to find—at last—legible words in your own handwriting:

“Breathe. A pulse is a drum you already know how to play.”

The letters glow faintly, releasing a hush of lavender dust that settles over the gears. Instantly, the machinery slows, obedient. The auditorium rights itself. The masked faces lower their blank visages, heat-venting like sculptures exhaling. A fresh spotlight ignites—not hot and interrogative this time, but gentle, the color of sunrise on water.

The balloon ascends, carrying away the stopwatch pendulum, snapping its chain with one decisive pop. A chorus of wind chimes rings overhead where the threat once swung. The domino seats blossom into a forest of paperwhite lilies, each trumpet-shaped bloom flickering with motes of gold. You’re no longer on a stage of gears but on a smooth obsidian platform that reflects the stars swirling above—constellations you’ve named after your own strengths: Curiosity, Tenacity, Joy.

In this hush, you feel your pulse settle into an even cadence, a metronome set to human possibility. The cue cards reshape into crisp pages bearing your outline, every point highlighted like a path of lanterns—and you know it by heart now, as though someone whispered the entire speech directly into your bloodstream. A microphone rises from the floor, twined with ivy. Its surface hums, eager, but no longer menacing.

You look out, and the audience masks soften into genuine faces, all watching with something close to hope rather than judgment. They mirror back your steadied breathing, your gathering confidence, your readiness to begin. The dream breathes with you, beating in sync.

Your mouth opens.

A single word—clear, resonant, and sure—drops into the hush like a pebble into still water, sending concentric ripples across every row. It is not the word you rehearsed, but something better, born from the marrow of a midnight heart:

“Welcome.”

And the entire auditorium exhales in luminous applause, the lilies releasing perfumed constellations, the ceiling rolling back to reveal galaxies swirling in appreciative arcs. Anxiety disperses into astral dust, and you understand that even here, in the deepest corridors of sleep where fears wear enormous faces, you command the stage; you shape the story; you turn shadow into spotlight.

You wake with the taste of starlight on your tongue and an unmistakable calm thrum in your ribcage—an after-echo of that dream auditorium, its crowd still waiting, but now you carry that balloon-message in your waking palm:

Breathe. A pulse is a drum you already know how to play.
