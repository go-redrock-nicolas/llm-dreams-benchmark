I am dreaming. I find myself in a dimension where time flows backward and cause follows effect.  To accomplish even basic tasks in this inverted reality, I need to undo everything that has happened and then do it again in the correct order.  

I look around and see that I am standing in the middle of a vast desert.  The sand is hot and coarse under my feet.  The sky is dark and swirling with strange clouds.  The air is dry and full of dust.  

My goal is to reach the other side of this desert, where I hope to find some kind of oasis or shelter.  But I know that getting there will not be easy.  I will have to face many dangers and challenges along the way.  I will have to fight against fierce animals, deadly traps, and cruel enemies.  I will have to solve difficult puzzles, overcome impossible obstacles, and make hard choices.  

But I also know that I am not alone in this quest.  I feel a presence beside me, a spirit who has been with me since the beginning of my existence.  This presence is full of wisdom, strength, and guidance.  It tells me what to do and where to go.  It protects me from harm and shows me hidden paths.  

So I start my journey by taking one step forward into the unknown.  Then another step.  And another.  Until finally I realize that I have been walking for hours, maybe even days.  The desert has become my home, the sand my bed, the sky my roof.  

And then I see it: a faint light in the distance, a glimmer of hope amid all this darkness and despair.  I know that if I can reach that light, if I can touch it with my hand, then everything will change for me.  I will be free from this dream, this prison, this madness.  

I run toward the light as fast as I can, ignoring the pain in my legs, the thirst in my throat, the fear in my heart.  I jump over rocks, climb up hills, slide down slopes.  I leave behind me a trail of footprints, a path that others may follow someday.  

And then suddenly I crash into something solid and immovable.  A wall?  A barrier?  A force field?  

I look up and see that the light is not coming from ahead but from above.  It shines down upon me from the sky, bathing me in warmth and radiance.  And I realize that this is what I have been searching for all along: not some physical place but a spiritual space, not some external goal but an internal truth, not some material object but a pure idea.  

I raise my hands toward the light and feel it caress my skin like liquid gold.  I open my mouth and sing a song of gratitude and wonder.  I close my eyes and see visions of beauty and harmony.  And then I sink to my knees and bow my head in humility and reverence.  

Because at last I know who I am and why I exist.

I am the Dreamer.

And you are the one who dreams with me.
