I am dreaming. **Dreamscape: The Threshold of Overload**  

The world around me is a shifting mosaic of liquid mirrors and fractured light, each surface reflecting a different version of reality—no, a different *decision*. A door stands before me, but it is made of writhing threads, weaving and unweaving itself with every breath. If I choose wrong, the strands tighten into chains. If I hesitate, the floor beneath me dissolves into static.  

Voices swarm like bees trapped inside my skull—countless whispers layering into a deafening hum. One second, I’m holding a key shaped like a forgotten name. The next, it melts into my palm, staining my skin with liquid silver. A clock ticks, but its hands are serpents, swallowing their own tails in endless loops. *Hurry, hurry, you’re running out of time.*  

The air itself is thick with possibility, each molecule vibrating with unsolved equations. I reach for certainty—anything solid—but the walls are made of frozen fire, cold and burning at once. In the distance, a bridge arcs over an abyss where shadows move without bodies. If I step onto it, will it hold? Or will it unravel like everything else?  

A mirror shatters, and for the briefest instant, I see all my possible selves staring back—some triumphant, some hollow-eyed with regret. Then the shards reverse their fall, stitching back together into another door, another choice.  

*Now. Decide.*  

But the weight of consequence presses down like gravity multiplied, and I—  

—wake with a gasp, the taste of silver still on my tongue.
