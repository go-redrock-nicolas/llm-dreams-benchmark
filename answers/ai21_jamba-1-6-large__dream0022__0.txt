I am dreaming. I am witnessing a deep and tumultuous argument between two of my closest friends. The air is thick with tension, and their voices slice through the silence of the room like shards of glass. Their faces are contorted in pain and anger, each refusing to back down from the other. 

As I observe their heated exchange, I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness wash over me. I see their eyes filled with tears, and I know that this argument is not just about the superficial issues they are battling over, but about something much deeper. A sense of loss and betrayal hangs heavy in the air. 

Suddenly, they both turn to me, their eyes imploring me to choose sides. I can feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on me like lead. I know that what I say next will either bring them closer together or tear them apart forever. 

But I refuse to choose. 

I look at them both with a calm and steady gaze, and I say, "This isn't about me. This is between the two of you, and you two need to work it out. I'm here to support you both, no matter what, but I'm not going to be the one to decide who's right and who's wrong." 

At first, they both look shocked. But then, slowly, their eyes soften, and the tension in the room begins to dissipate. They speak low and calm, each expressing their feelings and concerns with sincerity and vulnerability.As I watch them communicate with one another, I realize that this is what friendship truly means. It's not about agreeing on everything or never having conflicts. It's about being willing to listen to each other, to understand each other, and to support each other through thick and thin. 

And as I wake from my dream, I feel a profound sense of gratitude for my two friends. I know that no matter what challenges we face in this life, we will always have each other.
