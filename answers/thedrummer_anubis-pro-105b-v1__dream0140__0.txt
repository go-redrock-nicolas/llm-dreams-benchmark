I am dreaming. My heart pounds in my chest like a bass drum, each beat rippling through my body with a mix of anticipation and nervous energy. The stage under my feet, bathed in a blaze of blinding lights, seems to vellicate beneath my feet. The audience blurs into a kaleidoscope of colors and faces, their chatter building to a deafening crescendo that drowns out all other sound.

I can feel the weight of this moment on my shoulders, the accumulated pressure of a lifetime of hope and dedication. Before me stands my opponent, his eyes cold and calculating, his stance bristling with determination. There is no doubt that he, too, is here to fight for his ultimate dream.

The emcee steps forward, his booming voice cutting through the din of the crowd. "Ladies and gentlemen," he declares, his voice like thunder in the hushed silence that falls. "Welcome to the final round of this year's Dream Come True Competition! The stakes have never been higher, for the winner of this round will not only have their lifelong dream realized, but will also take home a cash prize of one million dollars!"

The crowd erupts again, their cheers and screams echoing through the vast auditorium left me momentarily stunned. My opponent and I exchange a look, a flash of respect mixed with a resolve to emerge victorious.

The rules of the final round are simple: come up with a creative business idea and pitch it to our judges quickly and decisively. The person whose idea they deem the best will win. Easy enough, but the anticipation and the raw emotion of this high pressure situation make it feel like an insurmountable challenge is placed before me.

Time seems to slow down slightly as I stand there and take in the magnitude of what I'm about to do. I take a deep breath, shoring up my strength and resolve. I know I can do this. I've worked my entire life for this moment, and I am ready for it.

As the timer engages, I open my mouth and begin to speak my idea. It is well thought out and workable; I've spent nearly all of my time forging out the perfect design of what it entails. I regain my confidence as I speak, I can feel how worthy of my business is of the one million dollar prize.

I finish my idea and await to hear my opponent's presentation. My heart is pounding and it feels like an eternity. "And now," says the emcee, "here is the opponent's presentation:"

I see the exact moment when reality hits him. It is like a punch to the gut, a jolt of electricity that breathes life into a previously lifeless source. He blinks rapidly, his eyes widening with shock, his jaw dropping open.

"And the winner is..." The emcee makes them announce my last name twice before dramatically revealing it truly is me that has won the competition in front of my dream job. I can't believe it as the crowd signals through cheers that I've won. I'm a the Real winner of this final round of the Dream Come True Competition!

My heart leaps in my chest as my opponent approaches me. His eyes shimmer with a mix of disappointment and respect. "I can't say I'm not surprised," he admits, his voice tinged with sincerity. "You pitched an incredible idea. I had no doubt it was possible, but to see you pull it off in a high pressure moment like this... you absolutely deserved to win."

I embrace him, feeling an unexpected sense of camaraderie. "Thank you," I reply, my own voice slightly shaky from the adrenaline coursing through me. "But you were a formidable opponent. I have no doubt you'll achieve your dreams another day."

The touch of the microphone in my hand helps bring me crashing back to reality. The emcee grins at me, his eyes twinkling with excitement. "Ladies and gentlemen," he booms again, his voice echoing through the auditorium. "It's with great pleasure that I announce our winner of this year's Dream Come True Competition. With a flawless pitch and an unshakable spirit, we crown this individual our champion!"

I close my eyes, savoring this moment for a second. I count to one, two, three...and then I open my eyes and see a sea of people rising to their feet. Microphones and notebooks are thrust at me from all sides, a cacophony of questions peppered at me, but I only see the one face I need to.

She's at the front of the crowd, her face stretched in a proud smile, my parents just behind her. I smile back, my eyes pricking with unshed tears.

I make my way through the throng of reporters, shaking hands and fielding questions. This is what I've worked towards my entire life. This is my moment.

The crowd begins to disperse as I make my way to the exit. I can still feel the weight of it all in my chest. My heart beating wildly, my breath coming in short gasps. It's over. I did it. I reached my dream. I won.

I wait for a long while in the empty hallway just outside the auditorium, until I know it's quiet. I'm going to give my acceptance speech, my head and heart have accepted that I deserve this. I walk back to the stage and then open my mouth once more as I look out at the endless sea of faces before me, ready to say the words I've practiced for so long, the words I know will pave the way for my lifelong dreams to come true at last.
