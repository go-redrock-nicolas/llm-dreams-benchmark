I am dreaming. You're in a vast hall filled with the mystical glow of fairy lights and ancient tapestries that whisper stories of old. Had it not been for the faint chatter of voices, you could easily believe you've been whisked away to a forgotten world. The group you're about to meet has been together for years, their bond as tangible as the air you breathe.

As you walk towards them, you notice the quiet camaraderie they share, each person's aura blending seamlessly with the next. They turn to you, offering smiles that are both welcoming and deeply knowing. You feel the weight of their expectations, but also their readiness to accept you.

They begin to explain the intricate patterns etched into their work, sharing stories of battles fought, lessons learned, and paths untaken. Their unity is inspiring, a testament to the strength of their shared purpose.

You long to be a part of their world, to drink from the same well of knowledge, to feel that sense of belonging. As you stand among them, part of you already knows you've been accepted, that this is the beginning of a journey destined to change you in ways you can't yet define.
