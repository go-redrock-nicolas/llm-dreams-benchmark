I am dreaming. I believe I have worked hard to earn my accomplishments, but someone suggests luck has played a significant role.  Confronting this challenge to my sense of agency, I yell "No!  That's not true.  I've earned everything by myself through skill and effort.  Luck had nothing to do with it."  But as I yell, I realize something strange is happening to me.  My body is changing shape and size.  My skin is turning green and scaly.  My arms are growing longer and stronger.  What's going on?
