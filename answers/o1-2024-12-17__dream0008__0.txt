I am dreaming. Your desk is tucked into a corner of the vast, open-plan office, and you can sense a hush that feels unnaturally heavy pressing down over every employee. The fluorescent lights above hum like restless hornets. The screensaver on your computer flickers with an iridescent pattern of spirals that look oddly alive, each swirl pulsing like a heartbeat. You glance down at your lap to find a stack of paperwork thicker than a phone book: forms, spreadsheets, mysterious diagrams, all requiring your immediate attention.

Your boss, whose name you can’t remember in the dream, looms over you. Her expression is polite, almost unnervingly so, as she hands you a slip of paper with an impossible deadline—impossible because the clock on your screen says it’s already five minutes past the time the project is due. There’s a flicker of panic in your chest, but no one else in the office seems to notice this monumental oversight. They continue tapping away at their keyboards, their eyes blank, as though they’re caught in a looping spell.

“Let’s see something spectacular,” your boss says with an unsettling calm. Her voice distorts as she speaks, words staggering out in echoes. She imposes a file into your hands. At first glance, it’s enormous: hundred-page proposals, bizarre flowcharts that shift and rewrite themselves as you stare at them. You drop the file on your desk, and instead of paper hitting wood, you hear what sounds like glass shattering. Cracks spiderweb across your desk’s surface, each fissure shining an odd, violet-blue glow.

Something is not right—clearly you’re dreaming, but you’re stuck in it. Waves of pressure roll up your spine, urging you to flee, but your legs feel sunk into a quicksand of dread. You push the top paper aside; beneath it, an image of an elaborate cityscape spills out like fresh ink, buildings spiraling into the sky in fractal patterns. For a moment, you’re so enchanted by the image that you almost forget the horrifying urgency of the deadline. Then you notice in the corner of the paper a flickering digital clock, ticking down the seconds you have left to complete the project.

Your computer monitor begins to expand, its edges bulging outward as though trying to eat the entire desk. Streams of data race across the screen—graphs, multi-colored charts, rows of numbers blinking in cryptic patterns. The fluorescent lights overhead flicker, and suddenly each light fixture morphs into a swarm of mechanical insects, humming with mechanical whirs and beeping codes. Tiny, metallic wings brush past your ears, and you clench your eyes shut to block out the unsettling transformation all around you.

When you open them again, you’re standing now—no recollection of leaving your seat. Your boss is behind you, a towering silhouette of shadow and fluorescent static. Her eyes glimmer with an artificial brightness, filled with an expectation that grows heavier by the second. The rest of the office is gone. Desks, chairs, even walls are dissolving into fractals of geometry, leaving you in a floating, infinite corridor of filing cabinets. Drawers keep flying open, launching mountains of forms into the space around you. They swirl and flap in the air like anxious paper birds.

You realize these documents are alive—feathers of text scatter off their pages like confetti. Desperate, you grab one of these living sheets only for it to hiss and squirm between your fingers, shrinking until it becomes the size of a stamp, then vanishing into dusty motes the color of midnight. The corridor stretches on forever, but behind you is your boss, arms crossed, an otherworldly presence blazing in her gaze.

Suddenly, a booming alarm resonates through this abstract realm—a harsh, clanging sound that reverberates in your rib cage. The floating corridor begins to quake, and the mechanical insects in the ceiling lights return, swirling into a cyclone overhead, scanning your face with a thousand metallic eyes. You clutch the rapidly shapeshifting file in your arms. It’s hot, glowing as though it’s about to erupt with molten information. Data points seep through the manila folder, dripping into the air like droplets of neon tears.

You feel the pressure: you have to finish. You have to produce something. You frantically flip through the unstoppable flows of numbers, diagrams, and charts, your breath coming out in ragged puffs. Every second that passes seems to stretch time, and yet you know you’re racing against a clock that’s seconds from striking zero. The alarm blares louder, and you crane your neck to see that digital countdown on the paper. There are only a handful of seconds left.

Something within you stirs—an almost heroic urge. You think, perhaps, you can do this after all. You stare down at the folder in your hands, willing the fractal data to coalesce into a single coherent concept. You speak words you’ve never said before, chanting them like an incantation. A furious, dazzling light engulfs the file, and it explodes in a phenomenon of colored stardust. In the vibrating haze, everything dims to silence.

When the sparkles fade, your boss stands there, calm as ever, surveying the aftermath. You hand her what remains of the project—a single, gleaming crystal shard. The countdown on the paper is at zero, but somehow, you feel as though you’ve delivered just in time. Your boss studies the crystal with piercing eyes, and gives the barest nod of approval. Relief floods through you with dizzying intensity.

Before you can even exhale, the surreal office collapses in on itself, a dream undone by the swift snap of consciousness. The last thing you see is the expression of your boss twisting into that polite, unreadable smile as she vanishes with the rest of the world in a swirl of shattered geometry. Then you awaken, heart hammering in your chest, uncertain if you truly finished the impossible project, or if you’ve simply escaped its strange, mesmerizing grasp.
