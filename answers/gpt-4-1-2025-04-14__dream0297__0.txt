I am dreaming.

It starts in a softly lit ballroom, the walls draped with velvet and gold, as if fashioned gently from the lingering memories of a Renaissance masquerade. Laughter, like scattered pearls, tumbles through crystalline air. The faces blur—beautiful, radiant, shifting beneath elaborate masks—but I glide among these apparitions with uncanny ease, draped in midnight silk that whispers at my heels.

Words spill from my lips like shimmering illusions, and with each phrase, eyes turn to me: wide, longing, entranced. My voice bends and twists, a melodic thread that feels as malleable as smoke. Anxiety and awkwardness dissolve—every social interaction becomes a marionette show, the strings weaving from my fingers unseen.

People flock, drawn close by my smiling charm, their admiration dazzling and weightless. I read their hopes in the curve of a cheek, the flutter of eyelashes, the way their laughter sharpens as I draw near. I offer them pieces of myself—a glance, a laugh, a gentle touch on the arm—but each gesture feels hollow, as if I am peering at them through thick glass.

With every delicate manipulation, the crowd grows thicker, odder, their faces now painted in hues not found in waking life: cobalt lips, emerald eyes, hair like rivers of fire or fields of wheat. They trust me, confide in me, hand over secrets wrapped in velvet boxes and truths hidden behind docile smiles. In their gaze I see devotion, but their voices echo in empty chambers inside my chest. 

The more their adoration grows, the more ethereal and untouchable I become, drifting among their affections like a ghost. My charm is a spotlight—I shine brilliantly at the center, but there is darkness behind my eyes, a mirror reflecting only my isolation. No matter how many circle around me, reaching with fragile hands, none can bridge the gulf between their warmth and my distant, frozen core.

In the heart of the ballroom, I stand atop a spiraling staircase as spectral dancers swirl beneath me. The music grows louder, twisting and strange, yet my sense of disconnection deepens—a vivid loneliness painted in carnival lights and hollow applause.

Their trust is mine, but I remain an enigma even to myself—a spell cast with no one to lift it. And as the dream drifts gently apart, like confetti on a midnight breeze, I linger in the silent knowledge that charm, without connection, is the sweetest and saddest illusion of them all.
