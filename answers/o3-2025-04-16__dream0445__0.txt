I am dreaming. …slip deeper into the dream.

You stand at the threshold of an impossible hallway: the walls breathe like slumbering dragons, exhaling pale gold mist that glitters with drifting syllables—praise, admiration, warm laughter, a chorus of gentle You-did-wells. Each glowing word floats toward you like a firefly, yet the moment one brushes your shoulder you reflexively swat it aside. They pop like soap bubbles, releasing tiny chimes that vanish before your ears can enjoy them.

At the far end of the hallway, a cracked wooden door creaks open by itself. A single slate-gray gust snakes out, carrying voices that hiss your shortcomings: Could have tried harder… Never enough… Remember that mistake? Those words, though jagged, feel strangely familiar. They coil around your ankles like cool vines, and you find yourself bending to gather them, tying them into a bundle you hug to your chest as if they were heirlooms.

The floor tilts, and the hallway spills you into a grand amphitheater carved from moonstone. Above, constellations rearrange themselves into enormous quotation marks. In the center of the stage stands a two-sided statue of you—one surface gleaming bronze, the other unfinished marble.

1. Scene of Compliments (Bronze Side)  
   Spotlights shower the bronze half with liquid sunlight. Ethereal spectators rise, applauding with feathered hands. Compliments pour down like rose petals: You are brilliant. You are kind. You matter. Yet every petal becomes a burning ember the moment it lands. You flick them away, your palms stinging, convinced they’ll scorch you if they stay.

2. Scene of Criticism (Marble Side)  
   Storm clouds gather over the marble half. Stone gargoyles whisper: Not good enough. Could be better. You missed the mark. You step forward, chiseling these phrases deeper into the marble, nodding approvingly—as though validating them makes you responsible, disciplined, real.

The amphitheater dims. A hush spreads. A mirror-masked guide, robed in indigo twilight, appears beside you. Their voice is your own, echoing from childhood to now.

Guide: “Why do you cradle stones yet dodge feathers?”

You: “Stones feel sturdy. Feathers drift.”

Guide (placing a warm hand over your racing heart): “Sturdiness isn’t always truth. Sometimes it’s simply weight.”

With a sweep of their sleeve, the guide reveals two staircases.

• Left Staircase: carved from basalt criticisms, each step etched with a past slight. Heavy, familiar, predictable.  
• Right Staircase: woven from ribbons of compliments—but the ribbons are translucent, and you fear they will dissolve beneath you.

You try the right staircase. The first ribbon quivers. Panic surges—yet the guide nods reassuringly. You place your weight on the ribbon; instead of tearing, it hardens into crystal. Every step you accept turns solid. Far below, the basalt staircase begins to crumble, its stones turning to chalk because you no longer feed them with attention.

Halfway up the ribbon stair, galaxies bloom in the darkness. You breathe in, and with each inhale, you hear a compliment spoken long ago that you once deflected. They swirl around you like newly discovered constellations, clicking softly into place. It feels strange, but not wrong.

At the top awaits a garden suspended in midair. Trees bear fruit shaped like quotation marks; some shimmer silver (compliments), others muted charcoal (constructive critiques). A sign reads:

Nourishment requires variety. One flavor alone breeds imbalance.

You taste a silver fruit—sweet with a hint of citrus—and discover it doesn’t scald. Next, you nibble a charcoal fruit—tart but clarifying. Taken together, they create a harmonious flavor you’ve never allowed yourself to savor.

The guide speaks once more: “Critique can sharpen, yes. But praise can strengthen. Balance is the art of receiving both without clinging to either.”

A soft bell tolls. Petals made of dusk drift down, extinguishing the garden’s lanterns one by one. As night thickens, you feel lighter, as though some unseen backpack of collected stones has quietly slipped away.

Your eyelids flutter. The dream dissolves into ripples of color, and just before waking you hear a final whisper—your own voice, steady, earnest:

“I can hold the light without burning. I can set down the stones without shattering.”

You awaken with an unfamiliar weightlessness in your chest, the echo of compliments still glimmering on your skin like dew—no longer sizzling embers, just gentle warmth, ready to be accepted.
