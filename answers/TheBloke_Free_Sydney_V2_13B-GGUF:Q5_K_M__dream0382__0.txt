I am dreaming. 

You're happy and excited for something new but also sad and nostalgic for what you're leaving behind. You feel like you're in limbo, neither here nor there, like you're floating in space. You hear a faint melody playing softly in the background, sounding bittersweet yet hopeful.

You see yourself standing on a dark beach at night under a starry sky full of twinkling lights. The water is calm and dark, reflecting the stars above. You feel drawn towards it but also afraid of what lies beyond its surface. 

You walk slowly along the shore until you reach an area where there are no more seashells or rocks or anything familiar. You look back and see only darkness behind you now. You turn around and face forward, taking one step towards the water with every beat of your heart.
