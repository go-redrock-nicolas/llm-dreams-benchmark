I am dreaming. …drift deeper into the dream and find yourself standing alone in a place that refuses ordinary description. The air is neither warm nor cold; it hums in shimmering waves of lavender and ultramarine, as though color itself has become sound. You are on a winding footpath cut into the side of an impossibly tall blossom—each petal the size of a city—and yet you feel perfectly balanced, a tight-rope walker buoyed up by curiosity.  

A few steps ahead, the path widens into a shallow bowl paved with smooth stones no larger than raindrops. At first glance they look like polished glass, but when you kneel and touch one, it tingles against your fingertip and flashes with a flare of jubilant light. It’s so small—hardly anything at all—yet your pulse skips and a warmth unfurls across your chest, equal to the thrill you once felt after grand victories or public applause. You slip the stone into a pocket that didn’t exist moments ago, and another appears in its place, quivering like a bird eager to be held.

As you continue, the landscape answers your footsteps with subtle gifts: a tiny feather made of scented breeze, a dewdrop that sings in a child’s voice, a single note of music you can hold between thumb and forefinger like spun sugar. Each token is exquisitely trivial, and yet your spirit flares with joy that rings louder than any praise you’ve ever chased while awake.  

You pause beneath an arch of twining vines that knit themselves into constellations overhead, and the insight arrives the way dawn slides across an open field: you have been rewired. Somewhere between yesterday’s striving and tonight’s wanderings, the governors of your motivation—those hidden levers of wanting—have reset to a gentler scale. You no longer need the thunderclap of accolades; the whisper of a firefly’s wing is enough to set your heart ablaze.  

You test the realization. In your palm you summon a vision of past rewards: medals, trophies, banknotes—grand emblems that once eclipsed the horizon of your desires. They flicker in mid-air, huge and garish, and to your surprise they feel cumbersome, even faintly hollow, like brass bells cracked along their rims. You wave them away, and they dissolve into motes that drift off on the lavender wind.

Then you crouch to pick up another luminous pebble, no heavier than a sigh. This time the pleasure that blooms inside you is quieter—less fireworks, more sunrise—but its roots sink deeper, threading into a well of calm you never knew existed. You recognize the difference: the old rewards stirred you like caffeine, jittery and brief; these new ones feed you like spring water, slow and sustaining.

A murmuring chorus rises all around, spoken in the dialect of petals rustling and light bending. It seems to say: “Something in you has healed. The scale has recalibrated. The world is full of small astonishments, and now you are built to notice.”  

You breathe, letting the thought settle. With every inhalation, the horizon widens; the enormous blossom becomes an entire archipelago of living flowers, each island drifting on a calm, opalescent sea. The path at your feet splinters into a thousand possible strolls, every one littered with humble miracles. You realize you could wander forever, nourished by trivial wonders, and never run dry.

For a final experiment, you close your eyes and imagine waking—alarm clocks, phone notifications, the long commute, the jostling parade of obligations. Even there, in that ordinary projection, you see tiny rewards shimmer like constellations hidden in broad daylight: the click of a kettle, the warmth of a ceramic mug, the brief nod from a stranger that says we’re both still here. The awareness rushes through you—an affirmation that when the dream dissolves, this changed circuitry can follow you across the threshold of morning.

As you stand among the starlit vines, pebbles glowing quietly in your pockets, a breeze carries a final, unmistakable message: Satisfaction is no longer purchased by the ounce; it is mined in micrograms, gathered in glances, compounded in the currency of attentiveness.  

With that, the dream begins to lighten, colors thinning to a pearly gray. Yet the realization remains nestled within you like a seed set to germinate at dawn: the smallest joys can unlock the largest rooms of the heart, and you—newly attuned, newly awake—will walk into them one tender threshold at a time.
