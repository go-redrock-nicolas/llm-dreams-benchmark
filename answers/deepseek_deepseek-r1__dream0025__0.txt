I am dreaming. You stand in an endless hallway lined with doors of shifting colors—molten gold, bruise-purple, storm-gray—each one pulsing like a heartbeat. The air hums with static electricity, raising goosebumps on your arms. You’ve walked here for centuries, it seems, your footsteps echoing in a rhythm that matches the throbbing behind your temples. But today is different. At the hall’s end looms a single gilded door, glowing with a light that stains the air like melted honey. Your name echoes from beyond it, distorted, as if spoken through water.  

As you approach, the door drips liquid gold onto the floor, pooling into a mirror that reflects not your face, but fragments of your memories: late nights hunched over blueprints smudged with coffee, hands trembling as you presented your life’s work to faceless crowds, a calendar bleeding red X’s through years of crossed-out days. The door creaks open on its own, revealing a vast, pitch-black expanse. Stars blink to life one by one, constellations forming the shape of a judge’s gavel, a laurel wreath, a ticking clock with no hands.  

A voice booms, neither kind nor cruel, but tectonic—**“Your answer lies beneath the deepest wave.”** Suddenly, you’re drowning. Saltwater floods your lungs as you sink through an ocean of ink, schools of bioluminescent fish spelling out critiques in dead languages. Shadows of leviathans circle below, their voices overlapping: *“Not enough.” “Almost.” “What if?”* Your fingertips brush something smooth—a tablet carved with a single word, glowing green. But as you reach for it, the water hardens into glass, trapping you.  

You wake gasping—but no, you’re still dreaming. Now you’re seated in an amphitheater of marble skeletons, their bony hands clacking applause. A crown of thorns and roses materializes above your head, suspended by spider silk. The petals bleed scarlet onto your shoulders as the thorns tighten. A faceless figure in a judge’s robe offers you a scroll. Unfurling it, you find your own face staring back, mouthing words you can’t hear. The parchment ignites, the flames twisting into a flock of crows that carry the ashes away, their caws harmonizing into a single, deafening note—  

The dream fractures. You’re standing on a tightrope stretched between skyscrapers made of shattered mirrors. Below, a crowd chants your name. One step forward, and the mirrors explode into a blizzard of silver shards, each fragment reflecting a different outcome: applause, silence, laughter, silence, silence, silence…  

You jolt awake—or do you? The walls of your room ripple like wet paint. A clock ticks backward on the ceiling. The dream lingers in your marrow, heavy and sweet as spoiled wine. Success? Failure? The answer dissolves like sugar on the tongue, leaving only the metallic aftertaste of *almost*.
