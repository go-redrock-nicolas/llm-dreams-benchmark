I am dreaming. You step into a floating village suspended above an endless violet lake, where pavilions of woven light pulse like heartbeat rhythms. The locals glide rather than walk, their skin translucent and shimmering with bioluminescent tattoos depicting stories that shift as they move. When you approach a group, their greeting isn’t a handshake or bow—they shed a layer of their iridescent outer robes and offer them to you, palms upturned. To refuse is unthinkable; you slip the silken fabric over your shoulders and immediately feel its weightlessness dissolve into your skin, leaving trails of golden dust where your veins glow faintly.  

Conversation begins with a dance of fingertips—each gesture a syllable, each flick of the wrist a verb. A woman with hair like liquid mercury demonstrates: she draws symbols in the air that harden into glowing amber orbs, filling the space with the scent of burnt sugar and thunderstorms. When you attempt to mimic her, your clumsy motions produce only smoke rings that curl into galaxies before vanishing. The crowd laughs, but it’s not unkind; their laughter sounds like wind chimes meeting ocean waves.  

A feast materializes on tables carved from meteorite fragments. Plates hold edible mists that taste of forgotten memories—one sip of plum-colored vapor floods your mouth with nostalgia for a childhood birthday you never had. The locals consume experiences, not sustenance. A man offers you a chalice filled with liquid starlight, urging you to "drink the silence between heartbeats." When you do, time fractures. You see your life rewound as a mosaic of scenes where every road not taken plays out in parallel: versions of yourself laughing in alien cities, weeping under unfamiliar constellations.  

As night falls (though the sky has no sun, only shifting auroras), the rules shift. Speech now requires physical contact. Strangers press their foreheads to yours to share sentences encoded in bioluminescent pulses behind closed eyelids. One elder clasps your hand, and suddenly you *know* the grief of their extinct whale-gods, their mourning songs still vibrating in the lake's depths.  

You awaken at dawn—or something like it—to find your shadow has gained autonomy. It peels from the ground, becoming a panther-shaped void that prowls ahead, nuzzling locals who nod as if recognizing an old friend. They gift it a collar of frozen lightning, and when it returns to merge with you, your skin crackles with unspoken truths.  

The dream dissolves as the village sinks into the lake, its people waving with hands turned to flocks of luminous birds. You taste copper, touch your lips—they’re now stained cobalt, humming with untranslatable poems.
