I am dreaming. ---

**The Velvet Silence Before the Storm**

The gallery smells of ozone and burnt lavender, walls breathing in time with your pulse. Your masterpiece hovers mid-air, a cityscape sculpted from liquid shadow and cathedral glass, suspended by filaments of humming gold light. The crowd’s murmurs blur into a droning hymn, their faces smudged watercolors behind the scrim of your trembling focus. Then you see it: a hairline crack splitting the base, snaking upward like cursive script. 

**Cracks as Language**  
The fracture deepens, etching glyphs you don’t recognize—sharp, geometric symbols that frostbite the air where they scroll. No one else gasps. No one else notices the cerulean paint bleeding from your sculpture’s skyline, pooling on the floor as iridescent mercury. You lurch forward, but your feet fuse to the onyx tiles, roots of cold burrowing into your veins. The audience claps, oblivious, as your creation *changes*. The glass towers warp into sinewy shapes, flesh-pink and veined, throbbing like a exposed heart. A smell of wet soil and burnt sugar floods the room.

**The Mirror That Swallows**  
When the velvet curtain finally lifts, the canvas isn’t yours. It’s a mirror—but inverted. Instead of your reflection, it shows a hollowed-out version of the gallery, walls peeling back like flower petals to reveal a blackened core where faceless figures writhe. You try to scream, but your voice unravels into smoke tendrils that curl into the mirror’s void. The audience cheers louder. Someone shouts, *"Revolutionary!"* as you stumble backward, falling through the frame.

**The Anatomy of Doubt**  
You’re drowning in a starless sea, but the water is made of your own sketches—discarded drafts and half-formed faces, their paper edges slicing your skin. Shadows coil around your ankles, hissing in your mother’s voice: *"You’ve always been too fragile for this."* Below, a colossal eye opens, its pupil a spiraling gallery of every piece you’ve ever destroyed, every stroke you’ve erased. The creatures there beckon with hands made of charcoal dust, whispering, *"We could have been masterpieces too."*

**Metamorphosis**  
Something snaps. Your ribs crack like porcelain, and light erupts from your chest—not warm, but searing, a supernova of cobalt and viridian. The audience’s applause twists into a keening wail as you burst, fractal wings of stained glass and wire unfurling from your spine. You’re no longer human. You’re a constellation of broken things reassembling: jagged mirror shards for teeth, oil-slick feathers, fingers that drip molten gold. The crowd flees, but their terror is pollen now, nourishing your metamorphosis. Your masterpiece shatters, and from its ruins blooms a new creature—a chimera of every doubt you’ve ever nursed, radiant and ravenous. 

**The Echo Upon Waking**  
You jolt awake, sheets knotted around your legs, throat raw. Dawn bleeds through the blinds. On your forearm, three faint marks glow—a constellation you don’t recognize. Somewhere, in a studio that exists between sleep and gravity, a cracked canvas sighs, still weeping liquid stars.
