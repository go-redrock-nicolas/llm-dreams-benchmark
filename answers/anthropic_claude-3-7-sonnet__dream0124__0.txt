I am dreaming. The sky is not above but below me—a swirling tapestry of midnight blue and shimmering silver, like an ocean of stars suspended beneath my feet. I feel simultaneously weightless and anchored, my body drifting in this reverse gravity while my consciousness remains oddly oriented.

I notice people around me growing younger instead of older, their wrinkles smoothing, their hair darkening and lengthening. Buildings reconstruct themselves from rubble, their materials floating upward to form pristine structures. Conversations flow backward, beginning with understanding and ending in curious introduction.

To drink water here, I must first feel refreshed, then watch as droplets leap from my body back into a glass that fills itself. The water jumps from the floor where it had been spilled, returning to wholeness. To read, I must comprehend the full meaning before my eyes trace the sentences from end to beginning.

Walking becomes an exercise in feeling myself arrive before deciding to journey. My footprints heal themselves behind me as I move, grass rising from flattened states to stand tall again. When I speak, others respond before I've formed my thoughts, and I must trace backward to understand what question I need to ask.

The most peculiar sensation comes when emotions flow in reverse—grief precedes loss, satisfaction comes before effort, and love grows from intimacy toward curious first glances. My memories from this place form not from experience but emerge fully formed, then gradually dissolve as I live through their causes.

In the distance, a mountain unmakes itself, stone by stone floating upward to reconstruct a peak that was never meant to crumble. Birds fly backward, their songs echoing in reverse harmonies that somehow still make perfect sense to my dreaming mind.
