I am dreaming. The scene unfurls before me like a dream within a dream. I find myself transposed into an unfamiliar world, one where the architecture is  clashing, neither old nor new, ancient nor futuristic. Columns of weathered stone twist skyward, adorned with pulsating neon runes. The air is thick with a cacophony of strange sounds - the groaning of distorted brass instruments, the electronic chirping of unidentifiable creatures, and an undercurrent of whispers in an alien tongue.

As I step forward, the ground beneath my feet shifts and ripples, as if walking on the very skin of some slumbering beast. I must concentrate on my balance, every nerve ending alight with the unsettling sensation.

Hesitantly, I approach the first person I see: a gaunt figure in tattered robes, their face obscured by a tattered mask adorned with glittering gems. They turn towards me, and I'm struck by the stark whiteness of their eyes, pupils black as obsidian, gazing at me with an unsettling intensity.

I try to speak, to introduce myself and explain my situation, but my mouth forms words in a language I've never heard before. It's as if my consciousness is library shelves of foreign cultures and mythologies, and my subconsciousen in the foxy face of the local language. The figure tilts their head, a gesture open to interpretation - confusion, suspicion, or perhaps a glimmer of recognition. 

Emboldened, I gesture around us, asking silent questions: Where am I? What is this place? How can I understand and communicate here? I'm met with silence, but the figure reaches into their robes and produces a small, ornate mirror. Twisting to glossy ebony handle reflects only an empty, echoing chamber. I place a palm against the glass, and suddenly I'm flooded with fragmented images and impressions. Snapshots of rituals performed under a blood-orange moon, the twisting gallery of secret societies that masquerade as fairytales, historial recall that hops from city to city like a necrotic crab.

I blink, overwhelmed and disoriented. The figure gestures to themselves and makes a sign, miming eating from an open hand. I realize they're introducing themselves - not with a name, but with a concept, an ideal. They repeat the gesture, then point to me expectantly.

Slowly, tentatively, I begin to mimic their actions, trying to convey my understanding. I extend my hand, envisioning the empty but hungry space between my face and their makeup. With a flourish, I fill that void with the first image that springs to mind: a towering bookcase, shelves creaking beneath the weight of ancient tomes whose spines writhe with magic. The figure nods, clearly satisfied.

Taking a deep breath, I begin to sketch out the next part of my message. I mime holding a notebook and scribbling in it, trying to convey the act of writing and documenting. A furrow creases the white brow, so I quickly pull out a hardcover you thumbed my finger through its pages. Velvet of leaves, whispers of poetry, billing of machinery.

Suddenly, the figure's demeanor shifts. The eyes narrow, and their posture stiffens. The mirror falls from their hands, shattering at my feet. In that instant, the dream world around us judders and warps, as if an unseen hand has suddenly twisted the dial on a
