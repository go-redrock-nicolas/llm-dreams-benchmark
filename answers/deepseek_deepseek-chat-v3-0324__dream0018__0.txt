I am dreaming. The air inside the house is thick with the scent of damp wood and rusted metal, a musty weight pressing against my lungs as I move through the halls. The walls, once solid and familiar, now shift like tired old bones—crooked floorboards groan beneath my feet, and hairline fractures weave through the plaster like the veins of a dying leaf. Every step makes the house exhale—a slow, pained whisper.  

Then I see it: a crack splitting the ceiling, jagged as lightning, creeping wider with each passing minute. Dust rains down in lazy spirals, catching the dim light filtering through broken slats in the boarded-up windows. Above me, I hear something heavy—*shifting*—then a long, slow creak. The roof is bowing. The house is coming undone.  

I rush outside, bare feet pressing into damp grass, and when I turn back, the truth hits me: the whole structure is listing to one side, the foundation crumbling into the earth like a sinking ship. The chimney leans precariously, bricks loosened like rotten teeth. My breath catches—*how did I not notice this before?*  

I have no money, no contractor, just my own two trembling hands and whatever remains in the rusted toolbox beneath the porch. Time is slipping, and the house groans again—a deep, mournful sound.  

Then, an idea flickers. Fragments of memories—my grandfather repairing fences, my neighbor patching a leaking roof with scavenged shingles, the way we used to jury-rig things when there was no other choice. I don’t know how to fix this, but I *have* to.  

My hands move on instinct. I drag splintered planks to brace the leaning walls, hammering nails at desperate angles. The wood is soft with rot, and halfway through, the head of the hammer snaps off—useless. I curse, then grab a rock, slamming it into crooked metal brackets to force them into place. My knuckles bleed. The air smells like sweat and rust.  

Above, the sky darkens—a storm is coming. The wind howls through the cracks, and the house *moves* again, shifting beneath my touch like a living thing resisting help. I don’t know if it’s too late.  

But I don’t stop.  

The dream narrows to this single, desperate act. The fate of the house—maybe *my* fate—rests on these broken supports, on the strength of my own exhausted hands. The first drops of cold rain hit my skin.  

And then—I wake up.
