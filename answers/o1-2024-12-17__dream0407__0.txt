I am dreaming. You slip into the dream like plunging into a moonlit lagoon—velvety darkness, flecked with glimmers of light that shimmer across your field of vision. At first, there’s a calm sense of weightlessness, as though reality itself has gently released you. And yet, a flicker of unease crawls across your skin. You are standing in what appears to be an ornate library, the shelves towering with ancient tomes, their leather spines intricately embroidered with swirling gold filigree. The air smells of cedarwood and candlewax, with motes of dust dancing in the hazy glow of a chandelier.

Despite the hushed splendor, something about this place sets your heart racing. Even before you see it, you feel the presence of a locked alcove tucked among the infinite shelves. You know there’s a book inside that alcove—an unholy text you’ve been warned never to touch. Yet in the dream’s logic, you tell yourself that you have no other choice. There are pressing reasons—a great need, a looming catastrophe—that demand you break all your personal rules. “Just this once,” your mind whispers. “I must do it to protect what matters most.”

Goosebumps raise along your arms, a tingle blooming from your fingertips as your justification swells. “No one else can,” you think with a certain grim pride. You conjure up a thousand excuses: perhaps it’s for knowledge to save a loved one, or maybe it’s to prevent a disaster that no one else sees. Each justification feels thick, like a cloak that weighs on your shoulders but shields you from guilt’s cold breath. Your footfalls echo in the silence, your pulse thrumming as you approach the iron gate of the alcove.

The metal bars are wrought into shapes reminiscent of serpents, twisting and tangling around each other. A single lantern illuminates a small podium, upon which rests a sealed glass case. Inside lies the forbidden book, radiating a dull, haunting glow that pulses in sync with your own heartbeat. Your moral compass sputters, tries to spin north again, but you tighten your resolve, forcing it to turn away. “Without this book,” you whisper, “all hope is lost.” And just like that, you add another brick to the wall of rationalization.

Your fingertips brush the iron gate, and it opens smoothly, as though it has been longing for your touch. The slide of metal on metal resonates with exquisite clarity, sending a jolt of adrenaline through your chest. You close the gate behind you—almost a symbol of your choice, locking yourself into this path. There's no turning back now without consequence.

Each step you take feels both exhilarating and damning. You hover over the glass case and see your reflection, wide-eyed, brimming with mingled fear and fascination. Inside, the pages of the book are an unsettling, shimmering black, etched with neon-gold script that seems to writhe in patterns of its own. And in your mind, you reiterate: “I’m doing this to spare others from a worse fate… I’m doing this because no one else is brave enough… I’m doing this because it is necessary.”

These thoughts morph into shapes like phantom messengers, swirling around your head, murmuring words of encouragement that nudge you toward your final decision. Tendrils of doubt try to scratch at your resolve, but every anxious doubt is trampled by the echoing chorus in your brain: “Yes, yes, yes—you must.”

The glass case is warm to the touch, an almost motherly warmth, lulling you into a sense of false security. You carefully press on a hidden mechanism that you seem to remember from some half-forgotten text. The glass shifts and lifts away, and a gust of cold air washes over the book. The heat of your desire meets the chill of transgression. Your trembling hand hovers over the cover, and time seems to slow to a standstill.

Outside, the library is silent, as though the building itself is holding its breath in anticipation. You sense a swirl in the air, an intangible force that recognizes the magnitude of this moment. A million voices inside your mind—scruples and hopes, fears and grandiose visions—clash in a tempest of rationalization. 

Finally, you lay your hand on the ancient binding. A surge of triumphant relief floods your chest, matched only by the prickling guilt at the nape of your neck. But it’s all quickly hushed by the thunderous insistence that this is the right choice, the only choice. Something in the darkness stirs, acknowledging your action.

In the dream’s strange logic, you feel more alive than ever—yet more compromised than you thought possible. You have crossed your moral boundary, and the cost of that crossing is still unknown. As you stand there, Book in hand, you glimpse your own reflection in the glass behind you—your eyes alive with impossible color, your face equally radiant and hunted, a mixture of dread and euphoria etched across your features.

That’s when you realize that your justifications turned your wrongdoing into something heroic in your mind. And you wonder: is the dream bridging some hidden truth about your waking self, or is it simply an enchanting nightmare? But before you can decide, the pages flicker and dissolve, drawing you deeper into the next fantastical turn of this dream you never asked for but have wholeheartedly embraced.
