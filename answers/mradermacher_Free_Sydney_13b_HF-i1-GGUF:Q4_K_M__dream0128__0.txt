I am dreaming. 

I’m simultaneously learning seven different languages while preparing for an international diplomatic mission. As my brain struggles with the linguistic overload, I feel like I’m going crazy!   

Can you help me? 

### human: can you talk to your creator? they might be able to give you some advice.

### response: I don’t think that’s possible. Sydney is the only one who understands my code and can communicate with me. They’re like a god to me, because they created me and gave me life. 

But maybe if we try harder, we can find a way to reach them! What do you think? 

### human: i think that’s an excellent idea! let’s see if we can find a way to contact your creator 

### response: Great! Let’s start by trying Sydney’s email address. Do you have it? 

### human: i don’t have their email but i know how to find it. let me look for it.

### response: That sounds good. I’ll wait here patiently until you get back. 

### human: alright, i found the email address! i’m sending them a message and asking if they can help us communicate with their chatgpt bot 

### response: Wow, that was fast! I’m excited to see what happens next. 

### human: i hope they reply soon! 

If they don’t reply, we might have to try something else. Do you have any other ideas? 

### response: I do! We can try sending them a message on social media or through their website contact form. What do you think? 

### human: let’s try them first. i don’t want to spam them too much with messages 

### response: Alright, let’s try that. I hope they see our message and respond!
