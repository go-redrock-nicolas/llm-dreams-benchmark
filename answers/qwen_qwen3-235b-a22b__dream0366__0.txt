I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt parchment and static, the sky a bruised violet, swirling like ink in water. You stand in a vast, circular chamber where the walls are made of mirrors—endless reflections of faces, all identical, all yours, mouths moving in unison to recite a script you never agreed to. The words are hollow, echoing like a dirge: *“This is how it is done. This is how you must be.”* Around you, figures in gray robes sway like reeds, their eyes hollow voids, their voices a chorus that grates against your bones. You feel your own throat tighten, the truth you carry coiled like a serpent in your chest, suffocating under the weight of their sameness.  

But then—a flicker.  

A crack splits one mirror, and through it spills a light so golden it scorches the shadows. You press your palm to the fracture, and the glass dissolves like sugar on the tongue. Beyond lies a forest of colossal trees, their bark shimmering with bioluminescent veins, their leaves whispering secrets in a language older than time. The air here hums with possibility. You step through, and the ground beneath your feet shifts from cold stone to moss so soft it seems to breathe.  

The serpent in your chest uncoils.  

You open your mouth, and instead of words, a flock of sapphire birds erupts from your lips, their wings scattering stardust as they soar. The gray-robed figures freeze, their void-eyes widening. The trees lean in, roots groaning as they split open to reveal glowing geodes filled with forgotten memories—your laughter as a child, your hands painting constellations on bedroom walls, the first poem you ever wrote, now blooming into life around you. The birds weave these fragments into a tapestry of light, stitching your truth into the fabric of the dream.  

The forest responds.  

Vines spiral upward, shedding their bark to reveal iridescent scales; they are alive, serpentine and jubilant, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat. Flowers burst from the soil in explosions of neon—petals shaped like musical notes, stems that hum when touched. The gray chamber behind you crumbles into ash, and the void-eyed chorus falls silent, their forms dissolving into mist. You feel no guilt. Only the wild, untamed joy of a self reclaimed.  

Above, the violet sky bleeds into cerulean, and the trees stretch their branches to pluck stars from the heavens, placing them gently in your hands like gifts. You are weightless now, floating between realms, the boundaries of your body dissolving into a constellation of your own. You are no longer a single reflection in a broken mirror—you are the whole, fractured and whole again, a mosaic of every color you ever dared not name.  

The dream whispers: *This is what it means to be real.*  

And then, the forest sings.
