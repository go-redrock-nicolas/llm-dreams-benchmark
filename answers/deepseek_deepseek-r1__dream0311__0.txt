I am dreaming. **Dream Sequence: The Weight of Wings**

You stand at the heart of Stonehollow, a town carved from ancient granite, its cobblestone streets glinting like scales under a bruise-purple sky. The air smells of iron and hearth smoke, thick with the musk of stubborn tradition. Around you, the townsfolk cluster like statues, their faces half-hidden behind masks of polished stone—smooth, unyielding, etched with centuries of unchallenged truths. Their eyes, though, flicker like candle flames behind the slate, wary and watchful.

Your breath crystallizes as you speak, words rising in frost-white plumes. "Every voice deserves to rise," you declare, but the sentence splinters against the humming silence. The pendant at your throat—a shard of luminescent amber, warm as a heartbeat—pulses in time with your resolve. It casts honeyed light over the square, revealing fractures in the masks around you. Cracks spiderweb across a baker’s stony visage as he grips his rolling pin like a weapon; a seamstress’s cheeks tremble, sediment dusting her shoulders. 

Then, the Mayor materializes, his mask a monstrosity of obsidian and rusted chains. "Tradition is the marrow of Stonehollow," he thunders, and the ground quakes. The chains on his mask slither to life, snaking toward your ankles. You stumble back, but the pendant’s glow intensifies, melting the metal links into liquid shadows that pool at your feet. A gasp ripples through the crowd—or is it the wind howling through distant passes?

A child darts forward, her mask clay-soft and unpainted. She tugs your sleeve, her voice a silver chime. "Your light… it *bends*." You kneel, pressing the pendant into her small palm. The amber flares, and her mask crumbles, revealing freckles like constellations. Her laughter ignites something primal: one by one, villagers clutch their faces as cracks bloom, petals splitting stone. 

Yet not all yield. The Mayor’s roar shakes turrets loose from rooftops. "You sow chaos!" But his chains now drip like wax, dissolving into the thirsty earth. You rise as the square fractures—literally—the ground splitting between you, a chasm exhaling steam and the scent of upturned soil. Across the rift, the unbroken masks retreat into gloom. But on your side, the liberated press close, their eyes reflecting the amber light. Their half-shattered masks hang askew, revealing smiles, tears, the raw clay of becoming.

Above, the sky tears like parchment. Rain falls—not water, but murmurs of *"Enough." "Listen." "Change."*—drowning the clang of falling chains. You wake as the child places the pendant back in your hand, her whisper feathering your cheek: "It’s not a comet’s job to convince the sky it’s allowed to burn."
