I am dreaming. Find myself abruptly transported to a snow-covered mountainside, the air crisp and cold against my skin. I am in avalanche terrain, with the snow conditions deteriorating rapidly all around me. The sunlight glints off the powdery surface which belies the danger lurking beneath.

A faint rumbling begins to rumble in the distance, growing louder and closer with each passing second. Panic begins to rise in my chest as I realize the ominous sound is not a figment of my imagination, but the all-too-real warning of an impending avalanche.

Turning to flee, I take a step back, but my foot sinks through the snow crust into the soft powder beneath. With mounting dread, I watch as deep fissures start to form around me, branching out in a network of cracks like fractured glass. The mountainside trembles violently, sending clouds of snow billowing up around me.

Thick icicles tremble ominously overhead, threatening to snap off at any moment. The once pristine white landscape now seems alien to me, the serene stillness shattered by the escalating commotion. Exerting every ounce of strength for control, I try to remain optimistic. 

While immobilized, an eerie hush descends over the chasm, strangely at odds with the growing sense of danger. In that moment of relative calm, I find myself pondering the surreal nature of the dream, questioning whether this is a vision of my own mind's creation or something far more profound.

Then, without warning, the tranquility is shattered as the mountainside explodes in a deafening roar. A colossal wave of white hurtles toward me, devouring everything in its path. In a desperate bid for survival, I throw myself to the side, every muscle tensing as I brace for impact.

Time seems to slow as the avalanche engulfs me, burying me deep within its icy embrace. The weight of the snow presses down upon me, stealing my breath away and plunging me into a suffocating darkness. yet in this dream, focusing intently, I can still see -submerged, I find myself in an ethereal underwater realm bathed in a ghostly blue light, where the laws of physics seem to bend and warp in impossible ways.

Float amongst delicate perpetual water blossoms floating in a dimension of deep space, and and float through realms both majestic and terrifying, my consciousness expanding to encompass the vastness of the cosmos. 

Yet even in this surreal landscape, I remain acutely aware of the dream's underlying message. As the dream begins to fade, I am left with a profound sense of the fragility of existence and the immense power of nature, beauty and terror, to both destroy and inspire. 

With a heavy sigh, I slowly emerge from the depths of my subconscious, the dream's vivid images still vivid in my mind. Even though I know it was only a figment of my imagination, I can't shake the feeling that there was more to it than meets the eye.
