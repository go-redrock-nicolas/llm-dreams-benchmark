I am dreaming. The dream begins in a grand, opulent library, its walls lined with towering bookshelves that stretch towards a vaulted ceiling, adorned with intricate murals depicting scenes from ancient myths and legends. The air is filled with the scent of old parchment and the faint, sweet aroma of distant rain.

I am standing in the center of the library, a vast expanse of polished marble floor stretching out beneath my feet. The room is dimly lit, the only light coming from the flickering flames of a dozen candles placed at intervals along the shelves. The shadows dance and weave, casting eerie, ever-changing patterns on the walls.

I am searching for something, though I am not sure what. I feel a sense of urgency, a gnawing need to find it, yet I cannot remember what it is I am looking for. As I walk, the candles seem to shift and change, their flames flickering in and out of existence, leaving me in a state of perpetual twilight.

Suddenly, I hear a voice. It is soft, barely audible, yet it seems to echo through the entire library. "You are not worthy," it says. I turn, trying to pinpoint the source, but the voice seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. I feel a chill run down my spine, a sense of dread that clings to me like a shroud.

I continue to search, my footsteps echoing through the vast chamber. The books on the shelves begin to move, their spines shifting and twisting as if alive. They whisper to me, their voices a chorus of disapproval. "You are not good enough," they say. "You will never be enough."

I try to ignore them, to push on, but the words gnaw at me, chipping away at my resolve. I feel a growing sense of despair, a deep-seated belief that I am unworthy, that I will never be accepted, never be loved.

As I search, the library begins to change. The shelves start to crumble, the books falling to the floor in a cascade of dust and decay. The murals on the ceiling begin to peel away, revealing a dark, foreboding sky. The once grand library is now a crumbling ruin, a testament to my own inadequacy.

I sink to my knees, my body wracked with sobs. The voice echoes through the ruins, mocking me, taunting me. "You will never be enough," it says. "You will never be approved."

Just as I am about to give in to the despair, I hear another voice. It is soft, gentle, filled with warmth and love. "You are enough," it says. "You are more than enough."

I look up, my eyes filled with tears. The voice belongs to a figure standing at the far end of the library. It is a woman, her face bathed in the soft glow of a single candle. She is smiling at me, her eyes filled with compassion and understanding.

"You are enough," she says again, walking towards me. "You are worthy of love and acceptance. You are enough."

As she approaches, the ruins of the library begin to fade away, replaced by a lush, verdant garden. The woman takes my hand, her touch warm and comforting. "Come," she says. "Let me show you."

Together, we walk through the garden, the woman's words filling my heart with a sense of peace and acceptance. I am enough. I am worthy. I am loved.

As I awaken, the dream fades away, but the words remain. I am enough. I am worthy. I am loved. And with those words, I find the strength to face the day, to face the world, and to face myself with the knowledge that I am enough.
