I am dreaming. I'm standing in the middle of an endless ocean, the water dark and ominous. There's not a single speck of light anywhere in sight. The only sound I can hear is my own labored breathing. I can't feel my legs anymore, and every time I try to take a step, the water pushes me back down. Panic surges through my body as I realize this is a nightmare - one where I'm drowning, unable to escape my own worst fear. 

Suddenly, a shadowy figure appears in the distance, seeming to pull me towards it. My heart races even faster as I struggle against the unseen force. The figure grows larger and more distinct, revealing itself to be a gigantic, monstrous whale. Its skin is alive with bioluminescent squid ink that reflects the ominous glow of the dark ocean. Its mouth gapes open, revealing rows upon rows of razor-sharp teeth. 

Just as the whale is about to engulf me whole, a beam of light pierces through the darkness from above. I look up to see a bright, shimmering portal appearing in the night sky. It pulsates with an ethereal energy, beckoning me towards it. Summoning every ounce of strength I have, I swim towards the portal as fast as I can. 

As I reach out to grasp it, the currents of the ocean reverse course, pushing me towards the monstrous whale once more. I close my eyes and scream in terror, feeling its hot breath on my neck. Then, against all odds, I feel myself being pulled through the portal. 

I awaken with a gasp, heart pounding and drenched in sweat. Thankfully, it was only a dream. But the fear it evoked lingers in my mind, a reminder of the power of the subconscious mind.
