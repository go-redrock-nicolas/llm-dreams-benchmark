I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering lake where the water moves in impossible ways—some droplets float upward toward the sky like reverse rain, while others ripple backward, erasing their own splashes before they even touch the surface. The horizon shifts and fractures like broken glass, each shard reflecting a different moment in time: a fleeting sunrise, the slow-crawling dusk, a midnight storm that hasn’t yet arrived.  

My hands feel strange—sometimes they are wrinkled and aged, other times smooth and young, fingers flickering between past and future selves. I try to take a step forward, but my foot lands on soft moss before my mind decides to move it. The air smells of thunderstorms that haven’t happened yet and the fading perfume of flowers already withered.  

A figure appears before me, made of gossamer and shadow, their shape never settling—child, elder, stranger, friend, all at once. Their voice echoes from all directions at different times, some words reaching me before they speak them, others arriving too late, leaving only fragments of meaning.  

"You must untangle the knot," they say—or will say—or have already said.  

"How?" I ask—or will ask—or have asked before.  

They point to the lake, where fish swim in looping spirals, their tails sometimes appearing before their heads. I reach in, and the water burns cold and hot at once, my arm flickering between submerged and dry, between healed and bleeding. Something brushes my fingers—a key, a letter, a smooth stone carved with symbols that shift when I try to read them.  

Then—suddenly, inevitably—I understand. The dream isn’t about finding answers. It’s about learning to ask questions in reverse. To accept that the fire comes before the spark, the grave before the birth, the farewell before the hello.  

The lake swallows me, or I rise from it, or perhaps I never touched it at all. Time exhales—and the dream begins again.
