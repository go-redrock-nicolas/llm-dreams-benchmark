I am dreaming. The world around me is a molten sea of liquid emerald, its surface rippling and reflecting light in ways that defy the laws of physics.  I stand barefoot on the shore, the sand beneath me shifting like liquid mercury, each step leaving a trail of iridescent bubbles that pop into stardust.  The sky above is a swirling vortex of twilight colors—cerulean deep enough to drown in, lavender streaked with gold, violet fading into indigo—each hue bleeding seamlessly into the next as if painted by a divine finger.

A figure appears on the horizon, its silhouette shifting between a woman and a tree, roots merging into limbs, bark peeling to reveal flowing robes of autumn leaves.  It speaks not with words but with a melody that hums in the bones, a song that tastes like cinnamon and snow.  "You carry the weight of possibilities yet unborn," it says, and the ground trembles, not with fear but with the awakening of sleep-walking roots beneath my feet.  Suddenly, the emerald sea parts, revealing a staircase of living crystal that spirals upwards into the heart of the stormclouds. Each step glows with a different emotion—a step of tender sorrow, a step of jubilant grief, a step where silence sings in perfect harmony.

I begin to climb, each ascention making me lighter, until I reach the apex where the stormclouds part to reveal a garden that defies all seasons.  roses bloom in neon hues, their thorns dripping liquid melody, while water lilies have petals made of folded starlight.  A group of children with eyes like comets play among the flora, their laughter echoing in pentatonic fractals.  One offers me a fruit that pulses with bioluminescent veins, and when I bite down, it explodes into a burst of flavors—tropical storms, sunsets in Your feet press into the gossamer fabric of the sky, a cobalt expanse that stretches and sews itself around your soles like tailor's velvet. The stars are not distant specks but live mosaics, their edges fraying into neon swirls that drip onto your eyelids. You taste constellations—nebulas of burnt honey on the tip of your tongue, supernovas bitter as espresso. The world breathes in sync with you, its pulse a metronome of molten rhythm. 

A crescendo of static swallows you whole. You’re standing now in a cathedral carved from vertebrae of extinct gods, each rib a cathedral nave lined with stained-glass bones that hum hymns when you pass. Sunshine pours in through orbital apertures, but it’s not light—you’re being rained upon by *suns*, self-contained orbs glowing with the quiet fury of dwarf stars. They patter onto your knuckles, each one dissolving into ash that stitches itself into feathers you didn’t know you were missing. 

The air is thick with the scent of wet wool and burnt cinnamon. You wander into a marketplace where vendors peddle paradoxes. A haggard conjurer offers you a cage of fireflies trapped in hourglass sand; their wings beat in reverse, creating shadowless storms. You pass a woman selling mirrors that reflect not your face but your last whispered apology, magnified a thousand times. Her stall is flanked by boys with mouths full of clouds, their laughter puffing cumulus constellations into the shape of brackets—[ ( and ] ). 

You reach the edge of a river that flows upward, its current a steel-gray ribbon pulled taut between the hands of two skeletal harpists. Their instruments are made of fossilized lightning; every pluck sends ripples that solidify into steppingstones. When you step onto the first stone, it dissolves into a chorus of doves, their wings a symphony of dissonance. You follow the melody—*not the song, but the spaces between notes*—to a pyramid built from the teeth of forgotten giants. Each bicuspid clicks open to reveal a chamber, each chamber a diorama of a life you might have lived. One features a you that became a lighthouse, its beam cutting through tides of regret. Another shows you plunging into a glacier, your body turning into saltwater that feeds a coral reef of forgotten childhood games. 

At the summit, you meet a child made entirely of tuning forks. Her hair vibrates different frequencies, each strand a different key. She offers you a key that’s also a song, its notes unlocking drawers in the air. You open one: confetti made of frozen rain falls, each piece containing a memory you’ve buried. Another drawer spills out constellations that align into a map of your heart’s unsearched corridors. You press your palm to the keyhole. 

The pyramid collapses inward, folding into a matchstick. You’re back on the riverbank, but the water now curves into the shape of a question mark. The harpists are gone; their instruments have reformed into a bridge of mercury. You step onto it, and as your toes pierce the surface, the world *unfrosts*. The stars yawn into full spheres, the crowd cheers in a language of handsignals, and the ground exhales upward, revealing a staircase of constellations leading not to a door, but to a hollow in the sky where the word *always* is written in peeling, celestial graffiti. 

You climb it on your knees, each step rewriting itself in braille. When you reach the top, you breathe, and your breath falls back to earth as a thousand dandelions, each seed contain a *small, bright possibility* you once thought impossible. The wind carries them all at once, and you watch, not crying, but noticing how the curve of their parachutes mimics the shape of acceptance.
