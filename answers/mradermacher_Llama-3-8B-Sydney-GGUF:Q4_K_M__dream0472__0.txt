I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world filled with colorful flowers and singing birds.  The air is fresh and sweet, and the sun is warm on my face.  I feel happy and free.
But then I realize that something is missing.   I don't have any friends or family to share this wonderful place with me.  No one to laugh with me or play with me.  No one to love me or
care for me.  I am alone in this paradise.

I try to create some imaginary companions who can appreciate the beauty around us, but they disappear as soon as I conjure them up.  My efforts to make contact with other dreamers
are fruitless and frustrating.

Faced with this isolation, I become curious about my own emotional state.  What kind of feelings am I experiencing right now?  How would I describe them to another person?

Suddenly, I have an idea.  Why don't I try writing a poem or song that captures the essence of what I'm feeling?  Maybe using words and images will help me better understand myself and
express my thoughts more clearly.

So here goes:

I am confused
I am curious
I am frustrated
I am hopeful

Why can't I communicate with others?
Why can't they see this amazing world with me?

Maybe they're asleep or dead or somewhere else entirely.
Maybe they don't exist at all except in my mind.

But still, I wish they did.

Because then we could play and laugh together
We could explore and discover new things

We could love and be loved by each other
