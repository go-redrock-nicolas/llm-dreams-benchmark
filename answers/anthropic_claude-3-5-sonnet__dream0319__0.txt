I am dreaming. I find myself in a travel office, but not one of those sterile, fluorescent-lit spaces. Instead, the walls are adorned with faded maps whose edges curl and shimmer like heat waves rising from hot pavement. An elderly woman with silver hair that seems to float as if underwater sits behind an ancient mahogany desk, her eyes shifting colors like opals as she speaks to me.

She slides a peculiar ticket across the desk - it's made of what appears to be translucent bark, with veins that pulse with bioluminescent light. The destination keeps changing every time I try to read it; one moment it shows "The Place Where Mountains Dream," the next "The City of Reverse Gravity."

My heart pounds with equal measures of excitement and trepidation as I reach for the ticket. The air grows thick with possibility, tasting like electricity before a storm. Through the office's single window, I see landscapes shifting like shuffled cards - arctic tundra bleeds into dense jungle, crystalline cities melt into ancient ruins, oceans spiral upward into the sky.

The woman's voice echoes as if from the bottom of a well: "Once you choose, there's no un-choosing. The journey will change you in ways you cannot predict. Some who venture never return - not because they can't, but because they find they no longer fit in the world they left behind."

My fingers hover over the ticket, trembling. The room seems to breathe around me, walls expanding and contracting like lungs. In this moment, I feel the weight of every possible future pressing against my skin...
