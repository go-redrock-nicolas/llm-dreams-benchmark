I am dreaming. …let go of every tidy syllogism and step, barefoot, into a carnival of delightful nonsense.

The moment you accept that up is frequently sideways and that apples recite poetry while falling sky-long, the city unfolds around you like a crumpled origami crane unfurling itself mid-air. Its streets are Mobius strips of cobblestone. Buildings float, slightly tilted, tethered to the ground by ribbons of moonlight. Nothing obeys geometry except, curiously, the shadows—they march in perfect right angles while their owners zigzag in spirals.

A polite mailbox in a top hat greets you in flawless pentameter—  
“Good evening, traveler, welcome to Whirlanne!  
Please post your certainty, abandon your plan.”  
You feed it every leftover scrap of common sense, and the slot slams shut with a satisfied sigh.

Currency here is traded in paradoxes. A street vendor offers you a steaming bowl of “Square Circles, lightly salted.” You pay with the riddle, “If I know one thing, it’s that I know nothing,” which the vendor pockets like a glittering coin.

To cross the central plaza you must pass the Garden of Illogical Delights. The flowers sing off-key lullabies that keep you wide awake; the trees shed leaves made of yesterday’s memories. One drifts into your palm—a memory you haven’t lived yet: sitting on a hill made of melted clocks, laughing with a friend you haven’t met. The leaf smells of warm nostalgia for the future.

You need guidance, so you visit the Oracle of Non-Sequitur: an enormous goldfish suspended in mid-air, drifting lazily inside a bubble of phosphorescent water. You bow; it speaks through ripples that turn to words in your mind:  
“To thrive here, traveler, walk backward into tomorrow, speak in metaphors you do not understand, and always—always—believe the unbelievable.”

Armed with riddled wisdom, you head for the Bureau of Accepted Absurdities, hoping to secure your “Permit to Disbelieve Reality.” The clerk, a translucent cat wearing spectacles, stamps your form with invisible ink. “Approved,” it purrs, “on the condition you never confuse fact with truth.”

Night descends in glowing brushstrokes of emerald and violet. Lanterns hatch from eggs along the boulevard, fluttering upward like soft-bellied fireflies. The stars rearrange themselves into punctuation marks—ellipses linger provocatively over the horizon, as if the sky can't finish its own sentence.

You finally reach the city’s edge, where a staircase spirals both up and down at once. A sign reads: EXIT—ENTER. You choose both directions simultaneously, feeling yourself split into mirrored possibilities that laugh, hug, and wave goodbye/hello.

In that impossible moment, you understand: logic and illogic are dancers, not rivals. They spin together in infinite pirouette, and to watch only one partner is to miss the music entirely.

With that realization, the dream folds gently closed, like a storybook at bedtime. The floating buildings drift apart, the singing flowers hush, and the staircase unwinds back into plain nothingness.

You awaken—perhaps?—holding the faint scent of future nostalgia, and discover a single, translucent stamp on your palm:  
Permit Granted—Reality Optional.
