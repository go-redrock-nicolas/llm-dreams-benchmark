I am dreaming. # The Labyrinth of Forgotten Stars

I find myself standing at the threshold of an ancient library that stretches infinitely in all directions. The ceiling arcs impossibly high, dissolving into a swirl of nebulae and celestial bodies that pulse with gentle blue and purple light. Books line shelves that spiral upward like DNA helixes, some volumes floating untethered, their pages fluttering like birds' wings.

As I step forward, the marble floor beneath me transforms into a shimmering pool that supports my weight while reflecting constellations I've never seen before. Each footfall sends ripples across the surface, disturbing star patterns that rearrange themselves into new cosmic configurations.

"You've returned," whispers a voice that seems to emanate from everywhere and nowhere. I turn to see an elderly librarian with eyes that contain galaxies and skin etched with scripture in languages long forgotten. "Most never find their way back after the Great Disappointment."

The Great Disappointment—suddenly I remember it clearly: the project collapse, the trust betrayed, the months of doubt that followed. Yet here I stand, somehow whole again.

"How did I overcome it so completely?" I ask, my voice echoing strangely in this boundless space.

The librarian smiles, extending a hand that holds a small, weathered book. "You read between the lines," she says. "The story of your resilience was written long before the challenge appeared."

As I accept the book, its cover warms beneath my touch, and when I open it, the pages contain not words but windows into moments of my life—small victories, hands extended in friendship, quiet epiphanies in darkness—all connected by threads of golden light.

I understand now. My recovery wasn't sudden at all, but a constellation of moments, each one a star guiding me through the night.

The library begins to dissolve around me, books melting into butterflies that carry fragments of wisdom on their wings. The librarian's form shifts into pure light as she says, "Remember, resilience isn't rebounding to where you were—it's discovering where you were always meant to go."

I wake with tears on my face and the lingering sensation of butterfly wings against my fingertips.
