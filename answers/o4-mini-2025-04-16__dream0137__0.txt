I am dreaming. You stand at the threshold of a vast marble hall that seems to stretch into infinity. Above you, the vaulted ceiling ripples like liquid silver, each panel reflecting a fragment of your face—some resolute, some anxious, some resolutely determined. You grip the handle of an enormous gavel carved from midnight-blue crystal, its weight both comforting and electrifying in your hand. Around you, the walls pulse with faint red veins, as though the very courthouse is alive, breathing doubt and expectation with every heartbeat.  

Before you spreads the bench: a long dais of polished obsidian, perched above a sea of restless spectators. By your side sits the grimoire of evidence—its pages flickering with whispered testimonies and spectral diagrams that shift shape when you blink. From the back rows, hooded figures slip serpentine coins toward the defense table. Each gold disc coils briefly into a venomous snake before dissolving into black ash. Their eyes glow with hunger; their whispers curl around your ankles like mist, pressing you to bend, to barter, to betray your sworn oath.  

Despite the mounting threats—the distant roar of phantom engines slamming against the courthouse doors, the sudden cracks of ice spreading across the polished floor—you feel an unshakeable calm bloom in your chest. You raise the gavel. Your voice rings out like a trumpet of dawn, each word luminous: “Order in the court!” The hall shudders, the floating lanterns above you brightening to pure white. With every ruling you deliver, the red veins in the walls fade. The schematic ghosts in the grimoire stand firm behind your judgments, their forms glowing more vividly with each declaration of integrity.  

In that suspended moment—your eyes alight with conviction—the onlookers fall silent. The coins melt away entirely, the serpents vanish, and even the distant engines retreat into nothingness. You have carved justice from shadow, forging truth with a single stroke of crystal. And as the last echoes of your gavel dissolve into the hush, you awaken, heart still thrumming with electric purpose and the lingering taste of triumph.
