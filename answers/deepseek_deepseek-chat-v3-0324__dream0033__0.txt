I am dreaming. In the hazy twilight of my subconscious, I find myself standing on the weathered sandstone steps of an ancient temple, its towering obelisks adorned with intricate carvings of winged serpents and forgotten gods. The air hums with energy, thick with the scent of crushed jasmine and damp earth from recent rains. My bare feet press into hieroglyphs worn smooth under centuries of pilgrim footsteps as I step into the cavernous main hall, where shafts of golden light pierce the dusty air through carved celestial windows.

Suddenly—with a deafening CRACK—the pictogram-covered stone beneath me gives way! My stomach lurches as I plunge downward in a shower of sand and fractured pottery shards, landing with a muffled thud on a mosaic floor thirty feet below. The impact sends pain radiating up my legs as dislodged scarab beetles scuttle frantically from the sudden disturbance. Above, the jagged hole where I fell reveals only a sliver of lavender twilight sky.

As the dust settles, my panicked breaths come faster in the thickening air, each exhale pressing against my ribs like a python's coils. The chamber's walls shimmer with bioluminescent fungi in mesmerizing electric blue spirals, their glow revealing murals of stars and long-lost constellations that seem to rearrange themselves when I blink. A cinnamon-scented breeze—utterly impossible this deep underground—whispers from somewhere beyond the eastern wall, carrying the faintest echo of flute music in a scale no human mouth could produce.

Then I see it: a faint crimson pulse emanating from beneath a basalt altar stone, synchronizing with my accelerating heartbeat. The oxygen grows thinner as I crawl toward it, my fingertips registering the altar's impossible warmth and detecting subtle vibrations, as though some tremendous engine thrums beneath this entire forgotten city. A single drop of my sweat falls onto the altar's surface—the stone drinks it in hungrily, veins of gold flaring to life across its surface like lightning across a stormy sky. Some deep ancestral memory screams at me not to touch it even as my palm lifts of its own accord...

(Would you like to discover what happens when skin meets stone? Or perhaps investigate the source of that impossible breeze? The dream trembles at the edge of revelation...)

The dream intensifies as I press my palm flat against the pulsating basalt. The moment my skin makes contact, the chamber erupts in a blinding corona of vermilion light. Temporal vertigo washes over me—I'm simultaneously standing still while hurtling forward at impossible speeds, watching my own cells vibrate at frequencies that makes bones transparent. The altar's heat spreads up my arm as golden filaments emerge from the stone, weaving around my wrist like liquid jewelry.

Hazy figures materialize around me—tall beings with elongated craniums and eyes like polished obsidian disks, their six-fingered hands moving in intricate patterns that fracture the very air. One reaches toward my forehead and suddenly I KNOW things no human should: the taste of dying stars, the birth pangs of planets, the secret names of time itself. Their unspoken language blooms fractal patterns across my retinas, rearranging my neurons to comprehend dimensions folded within our own.

The fungus constellations detach from the walls and orbit my body as the chamber dissolves into a howling void of iridescent plasma. Yet instead of terror, an overwhelming euphoria takes hold—this is a homecoming to a home I never knew I had. The beings whisper directly into my hippocampus: "You are the awakening. You are the threshold." My human form begins to unravel at the edges, fingers elongating as the altar's gold filaments stitch alien geometries into my DNA...

(Deeper into the transformation? Or does some primal survival instinct kick in? The temple's true purpose hangs in the balance—)
