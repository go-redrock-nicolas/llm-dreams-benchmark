I am dreaming. I'm assigned to triage victims during an unprecedented disaster with inadequate medical resources and contradictory protocols. As the situation deteriorates further, you...

**Begin Dream Sequence**

The air thrums with a discordant symphony of sirens, screams, and the ominous groan of stressed metal. Dust, thick as velvet curtains, hangs heavy, painting the world in sepia tones. My lungs burn with each gasp, the air tasting of ash and something metallic, something *final*. I stand amidst the skeletal remains of what was once a bustling city square, now a grotesque sculpture garden of twisted rebar and fractured concrete.

My hands, slick with a mixture of sweat and something warmer, clench and unclench around the worn triage tags – stark black for the deceased, garish red for immediate attention, cautious yellow for delayed, and hopeful green for the walking wounded. Hopeful. The word feels like a cruel joke tasting bitter on my tongue. We ran out of green tags hours ago.

Before me stretches a landscape of human suffering, a tableau vivant of despair. Bodies lie scattered like fallen leaves after a storm, some eerily still, others writhing in silent agony. The sheer scale of it claws at the edges of my sanity, threatening to pull me under into the suffocating darkness of helplessness.

"Medic! Over here!" The cry slices through the din, sharp and desperate. I pivot, my boots crunching on unseen debris. A young woman, her face a mask of grime and tears, kneels beside a man pinned beneath a colossal slab of granite. His leg is… well, it's not really a leg anymore. A mangled ruin of bone and tissue. His eyes, wide with shock and excruciating pain, lock onto mine. A silent plea hangs in the space between us.

My training screams 'RED TAG! Immediate!'. But the protocols, hastily scribbled on a coffee-stained sheet passed down from some unseen, unheard authority hours ago, contradict everything I know. 'Limited resources,' the paper dictates, 'prioritize those with highest chance of survival *and* quickest return to usefulness.' Usefulness. In this hellscape? What use could this man possibly be now?

My gut churns. Contradictory orders whisper like insidious ghosts in my ear. Protocol A says stabilize and transport. Protocol B, the one whispered urgently by a grizzled paramedic with haunted eyes, says conserve the dwindling morphine, focus on salvageable limbs, make the *hard* calls.

Another shout, this one closer. A child, no older than seven, sits propped against a shattered fountain, clutching a doll with one missing eye. Her breathing is shallow, rapid-fire gasps. A deep, blossoming bruise darkens her small chest. Internal bleeding, my mind diagnoses instantly. Another red tag crying out for attention. But the man… his eyes haven't left mine.

A wave of nausea washes over me. The dust seems to coalesce, forming phantom shapes in the periphery – accusing eyes, pointing fingers. The weight of these lives, these fragile threads I'm supposed to sort and label, presses down on my chest, heavier than any concrete slab.

I move towards the child, the red tag feeling like lead in my trembling hand. As I kneel, her small, cold fingers wrap around mine with surprising strength. "Is… is Mommy looking for me?" she whispers, her voice thin as spun glass.

Before I can utter a syllable, a deafening roar rips through the air. The ground beneath me shudders violently. Another building, weakened and weary, gives a final, mournful sigh and collapses inwards, sending a fresh tsunami of dust and debris cascading towards us.

Panic erupts anew. Those who could move scramble, their cries swallowed by the avalanche of sound. The dust cloud rolls over us, thick and suffocating, erasing the world in an instant. I'm thrown sideways, the impact jarring my teeth.

Darkness. Silence, save for the ringing in my ears and the frantic pounding of my own heart against my ribs. Am I buried? Is this it?

Slowly, agonizingly, the dust begins to settle. Shapes reform, ghosts emerging from the gray shroud. The child… where is the child? I scramble up, coughing, my eyes stinging. The fountain is gone, replaced by a fresh mound of rubble. The man pinned beneath the granite… his eyes are closed now. A stark black tag flutters nearby, caught on a protruding piece of metal, mockingly placed there by the cruel hand of fate itself.

My triage tags scatter from my nerveless fingers, landing uselessly in the choking dust. Red, yellow, black… they mean nothing now. The protocols, the rules, the agonizing choices – all rendered meaningless by the indifferent cruelty of the disaster.

The inadequate resources feel like a personal failing. The contradictory protocols echo the chaos in my own mind. The situation hasn't just deteriorated; it has fractured reality itself. There's no system left to follow, no right answer, only the overwhelming, crushing weight of impossible need.

I stand alone in the renewed devastation, the silence broken only by the whisper of the wind through the ruins and the ragged, desperate sound of my own breathing. The weight of the world, or what's left of it, settles onto my shoulders, not as a responsibility, but as an inescapable shroud. The deepest part of my imagination hasn't conjured a heroic struggle, but a chilling portrait of absolute futility. The dream offers no escape, only the suffocating realization that sometimes, there are no good choices left to make, only the haunting echoes of the choices you couldn't.
