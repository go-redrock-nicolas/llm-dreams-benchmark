I am dreaming. I am flying over a beautiful city when suddenly I see a storm coming from far away. Itâ€™s very scary! The clouds turn dark, lightning flashes, and thunder roars. Raindrops start falling heavily and wind blows strongly. Trees bend, roofs leak, and cars crash. People run indoors seeking shelter. I wonder what will happen next...
