I am dreaming. I find myself in a looping corridor of memory, where the walls shimmer with reflections of a conversation gone wrong. Each mirror-like panel replays the moment—a casual comment from my closest friend that somehow cut deeper than intended. The slight feels enormous here in this dream space, magnified by my own insecurities. Their words echo around me, growing distorted and more hurtful with each reverberation.

I notice my dream-self growing smaller, shoulders hunched, colors fading from my clothing as I obsessively replay the scene. The corridor narrows, ceiling dropping incrementally. My breath quickens. The air feels thick, difficult to draw into my lungs.

Then—a strange blue butterfly lands on my wrist. Its wings pulse with an impossible light, creating ripples across the mirrored surfaces. The butterfly's presence shifts something fundamental in the dream. I watch my reflection closely and see that when I breathe in rhythm with the butterfly's wings, the corridors widen slightly.

"What am I doing to myself?" my dream voice asks, surprisingly clear.

The butterfly takes flight, leaving a trail of luminescent dust that forms words in the air: "You choose what to carry."

The mirrors begin showing different scenes—the countless times this friend has shown up for me, moments of genuine connection, laughter shared across years. I feel my dream-body straightening, expanding.

The corridor transforms into an open meadow where the night sky blooms with nebulae and slow-moving celestial bodies. The weight lifts from my chest. In the distance, I see my friend walking toward me, their form partially transparent, partially made of starlight.

I understand, in that peculiar dream-knowing way, that holding onto hurt is a choice—one that dims my own light first. The meadow grass waves beneath my feet, whispering that forgiveness begins with releasing the grip on pain, not with another's apology.

I reach my hands toward the stars and feel myself rising, weightless and whole again.
