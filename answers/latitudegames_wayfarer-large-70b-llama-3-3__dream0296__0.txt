I am dreaming. In this ethereal realm of my mind, I stand transfixed before a mirror that materializes out of the swirling mists. As I catch sight of my reflection, a jarring disorientation grips me. The person staring back is unrecognizable - a stranger's face gazing at me with curious surprise. Where once my familiar features were etched, now a kaleidoscope of impossible characteristics mingle. My skin shimmers with an opalescent hue, refracting light into miniature rainbows. Alien eyes - pools of bioluminescent water containing galaxies within their depths - blink in bewilderment. The disconnect between my perceived self and this bizarre reflection sends waves of vertigo through my form, as if my very identity is shifting like quicksand beneath me. I raise a trembling hand to touch this mirage-flesh, and the glass ripples like liquid. The reflection ripples and distorts with every movement, taunting me with the fragmented pieces of who I may or may not be. As I watch, transfixed and horrified, my form dissolves into pinpoints of light that swirl and reform into new, even more alien configurations. I struggle to grasp who I am, to reconcile the me I know with the me I see - but like chasing smoke, each attempt to define myself slips through my grasp, leaving only the haunting echo of a thousand possible selves.
