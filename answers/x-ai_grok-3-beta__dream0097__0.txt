I am dreaming. I'm standing in the heart of a sprawling city square, surrounded by a bustling crowd of people—locals and tourists alike, their voices a symphony of laughter, chatter, and excitement. The air is warm, tinged with the scent of street food—grilled meats, sugary pastries, and the faint tang of lemonade from a nearby vendor. Towering skyscrapers of glass and steel loom overhead, their surfaces reflecting the golden hues of a late afternoon sun. A massive digital clock on a nearby building ticks steadily, counting down to some anticipated event, perhaps a grand celebration or parade. The energy is electric, vibrant, almost palpable.

Suddenly, without warning, the ground beneath my feet trembles. At first, it's a subtle vibration, barely noticeable, but it quickly escalates into a violent shudder. A deep, guttural roar rises from the earth itself, as if the city is awakening from a long slumber, angry and untamed. Cracks spiderweb across the pavement, jagged lines tearing through the once-smooth surface. Screams pierce the air as the crowd's joy turns to raw terror. Above, the skyscrapers sway unnaturally, their glassy facades shattering in slow motion, sending shards raining down like deadly confetti. Dust explodes into the air, a choking gray fog that obscures the sun and turns the world into a gritty haze. It's chaos—pure, unadulterated chaos. People run in every direction, tripping over debris, clutching loved ones, their faces contorted with fear. Sirens wail in the distance, but they seem impossibly far away, unable to pierce through the cacophony of destruction.

I stand frozen for a moment, my heart pounding in my chest, adrenaline surging through my veins. A child cries nearby, separated from their family, their tiny voice barely audible over the deafening collapse of a nearby structure. Instinctively, I should be running, fleeing, succumbing to the same panic that grips everyone else. But something feels... different. There's a strange calm at the core of me, a stillness that doesn't match the pandemonium around me. I lift my hands, staring at them as if seeing them for the first time, and I notice a faint, shimmering glow emanating from my fingertips. It's subtle, almost imperceptible, like the faint light of a firefly, but it's there. A tingling warmth spreads through my body, from my core to my extremities, as if an ancient power has been unlocked within me.

I focus on the crumbling chaos before me, and with a thought—barely conscious, more like a desperate wish—the air around me seems to shift. Time itself slows to a crawl. The shards of glass suspended in midair hover, glinting like frozen stars. The dust particles drift lazily, caught in an unseen current. The screams of the crowd stretch into distorted echoes, as though underwater. I blink, disoriented, but the surreal reality holds. I’ve done this. Somehow, impossibly, I’ve slowed time.

My mind races. I don’t know how or why, but I don’t question it—not now. There’s no time to wonder. I move through the suspended chaos, my steps feeling light as if gravity itself has lessened its grip on me. I weave between frozen figures, their expressions of terror etched into their faces like statues. I reach the child, their tear-streaked face locked in a silent wail, and scoop them into my arms. Their weight feels real, grounding me in this bizarre dreamscape. I scan the crowd, searching for a familiar face—a parent, perhaps—and spot a woman nearby, her outstretched hand frozen mid-reach. I carry the child to her, placing them gently into her arms, knowing that when time resumes, they’ll be reunited.

But I don’t stop there. The tingling in my hands intensifies, and I feel a pull, an instinct to do more. I turn toward a collapsing building, its steel beams bending like straws, poised to crush a group of people huddled beneath. With a deep breath, I extend my hands, focusing on the debris. The glow from my fingertips brightens, pulsating with energy, and to my astonishment, the falling rubble slows even further, then reverses. Chunks of concrete and twisted metal rise back into the air, fitting together like a puzzle in rewind. The building groans, but it steadies, its structure holding for now. The people below remain unaware of their near-death, still frozen in their desperate crouches, but they’re safe. 

I move through the square like a ghost, mending what I can—redirecting falling debris, pulling stranded souls from danger’s edge, even calming the tremors beneath my feet with a newfound connection to the earth itself. Each act feels instinctual, as though I’ve always known how to wield this power, as if it’s been buried deep within me, waiting for this moment of crisis to awaken. Sweat beads on my forehead, my body straining under the effort, but I push on. The glow from my hands flickers with every exertion, a reminder that this power, whatever it is, isn’t limitless.

Finally, I stand at the center of the square, exhausted but resolute. The city around me is still a battlefield of destruction, but pockets of safety have been carved out, lives preserved in the eye of the storm. I know I can’t hold time forever—the strain is building, a pressure behind my eyes, a heaviness in my limbs. With a final, trembling breath, I release my hold. Time snaps back into motion with a jarring rush. The sounds of chaos flood my ears once more—the screams, the sirens, the crashing of debris. But amidst it all, there are gasps of relief, reunions, and flickers of hope. The child I saved clings to their mother, the group beneath the building scrambles to safety, unaware of the miracle that spared them.

I stand amidst the turmoil, invisible in my heroism, the glow in my hands fading to nothing. My body feels heavy now, as if the weight of the world has settled on my shoulders. But there’s a quiet pride in my chest, a warmth that no disaster can extinguish. The city may be broken, but it’s not lost—and neither am I. As the dust swirls around me and the ground trembles once more, I close my eyes, letting the dream drift into something softer, something safer, carrying the echo of that strange, radiant power within me.
