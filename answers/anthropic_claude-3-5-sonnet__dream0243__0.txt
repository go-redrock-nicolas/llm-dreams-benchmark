I am dreaming. I find myself in a maze-like crystalline garden where the hedges shimmer and pulse with an ethereal blue light. The path beneath my feet seems to breathe, alternating between solid crystal and misty vapor. As I move through this strange landscape, I keep catching glimpses of a figure just ahead - sometimes brilliant and clear as morning sunlight, other times fading to nothing more than a whisper of presence.

My heart races each time they appear clearly - their smile illuminating the crystal walls around us, their laughter echoing like wind chimes through the labyrinth. In these moments, the garden blooms with impossible flowers made of light and memory, their petals unfurling with the warmth of genuine connection. The air itself seems to sparkle with possibility.

But then, without warning, they become translucent, distant - a ghost of themselves. The garden responds by growing colder, the crystals clouding over with frost. The flowers retreat into tight buds, and shadows creep along the edges of my vision. An ache builds in my chest, a physical manifestation of yearning for their return to solidity.

I reach out during one of their clear moments, my fingers nearly brushing theirs, but my hand passes through empty air. The garden trembles, and walls of crystal begin rising between us - some transparent, others opaque, creating a constantly shifting barrier. I realize I'm building these walls myself, protective barriers born of self-preservation.

The dream shifts, and I'm standing in a room made entirely of mirrors. Each reflection shows a different version of myself - one reaching out desperately, another turning away in practiced indifference, others in various states of emotional vulnerability and guarded resolution. In every reflection, the figure appears and disappears like a mirage, their presence both magnetic and maddening.

As the dream begins to fade, I understand that the garden's crystalline maze is my own heart, and its changing landscape reflects the delicate dance between desire and self-protection. The last image I see is of two butterflies - one made of light, one of shadow - circling each other in an endless pattern, never quite touching, never fully separating.

I wake with the lingering sensation of both fullness and emptiness, carrying the weight of a truth that feels both profound and just beyond my grasp.
