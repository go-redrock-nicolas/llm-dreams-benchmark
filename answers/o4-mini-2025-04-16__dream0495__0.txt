I am dreaming. You drift into a twilight realm where the air quivers like silken chiffon, each breath scented with moon-dust and night-blooming jasmine. Beneath your bare feet the ground pulses with soft luminescence, as if the earth itself were breathing. Colors ripple in the sky—crimson melting into sapphire, then fracturing into fields of violet sparkles. Somewhere overhead, a slow, melodic hum resonates, guiding you deeper into this living tapestry of dream.

You wander into a grand hall of fading memories. Along one wall stands an easel where once you painted dawns in every shade of hope; now the canvas yawns blank, brushes dangling like silent sentinels. On another, a stage where your voice once soared—now the microphones stand mute, their wires curling like sleeping serpents. The instruments you loved lie scattered: a violin with frayed strings, a piano with keys that sink like tired hearts. Familiar halls you shaped with passion feel hollow, as if purpose has slipped away the moment you stepped inside.

A corridor of mirrors beckons. In each reflection, you see a different self: the artist, the teacher, the explorer. But none radiate the conviction you remember. Their gazes are soft, searching. When you reach to touch the glass, your fingertips brush an icy film, and the image shatters into petals of light. Those fragments swirl around you, whispering—reminding you that fulfillment isn’t fixed, that it flows and reforms like water through your fingers.

Drawn forward by a gentle tug, you arrive at a still lake whose surface is liquid moonlight. You kneel at its edge and peer in. Your reflection stares back—not as the person anchored to old definitions, but as someone unbound, silhouette flickering between past and possible. The water ripples, and the world beneath reveals scores of tiny boats, each carrying a single glowing lantern. One by one you tiptoe across the lake’s glassy skin, lighting lantern after lantern until the entire surface shimmers with a thousand hopes.

On the far shore, a colossal tree stands, its bark etched with intricate runes. Golden roots anchor it to bedrock; its branches reach out to weave a canopy of dancing lights. Beneath this living cathedral, a voice—neither male nor female, neither young nor old—speaks: “True purpose grows like these roots. You may plant it here, or there, or even beneath a star. Water it with curiosity, not obligation.” In that moment, the weight of old expectations falls away. You feel something new unfurling in your chest, bright and tremulous.

When the dream begins to dissolve—colors draining into soft mist—you rise and step toward a lone butterfly, its wings painted in molten sunrise. It lifts before you, a living beacon, and you follow. With each flutter it whispers of uncharted paths and passions yet unnamed. Hand in hand with that flickering guide, you walk into the dawn of a fresh purpose, ready to discover meaning wherever your heart chooses to roam.
