I am dreaming. As I drift into the realm of dreams, the world around me softens, edges blurring like watercolor on a canvas soaked in twilight hues. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering lake, its surface a mirror of molten silver under a sky strewn with stars that pulse like heartbeats. The air is warm, carrying the faint scent of jasmine and something ancient, something I can’t quite name but feel deep in my bones. 

I’m alone at first, or so I think, until I notice ripples forming on the lake, gentle at the start, then growing bolder, as if something unseen is stirring beneath. My heart quickens—not out of fear, but with a strange, magnetic pull. I’ve always believed that relationships must be built on rigid structures, on roles and expectations carved in stone: you give this, I give that; you stay here, I stay there. It’s a belief I’ve clung to like a lifeline, a map to navigate the chaos of human connection. But standing here, on the edge of this dream-lake, I feel the weight of that belief dragging at my ankles like chains.

A figure emerges from the water, not with a splash but with a graceful unfolding, as if the lake itself has woven them from threads of moonlight and mist. They are neither man nor woman, neither friend nor stranger, but something in between—a presence that feels like every longing I’ve ever buried, every word I’ve never dared to speak. Their eyes are deep pools of amber, endless, and when they look at me, I feel stripped bare, not of clothes but of pretense. “Why do you build walls when you could build bridges?” they ask, their voice a melody that vibrates through the air, through me, stirring something dormant in my chest.

I open my mouth to defend my belief, to explain that walls are safe, that they keep the hurt out, that relationships must have boundaries to survive. But the words dissolve on my tongue, bitter and hollow, and I realize I don’t believe them anymore—not here, not now. The figure stretches out a hand, not to pull me in but to invite, and I hesitate only for a heartbeat before stepping forward. The water is warm as it closes over my feet, then my knees, then my waist, and I’m not sinking—I’m buoyant, weightless, as if shedding that old belief has unshackled me from gravity itself.

We float together, this mysterious being and I, and the lake begins to transform. Beneath us, it’s no longer just water but a tapestry of memories—every connection I’ve ever had, every moment of joy and pain, glowing like submerged lanterns. I see the times I held back, the times I demanded instead of listened, the times I assumed instead of asked. And I see, too, the missed chances to be raw, to be real, to let someone in without a script or a safeguard. The figure beside me doesn’t speak, but their presence hums with a quiet truth: relationships aren’t transactions or fortresses—they’re dances, messy and wild, requiring vulnerability as the first step.

I dive deeper into this revelation, into the lake of my own heart, and it’s like swimming through liquid starlight. The old belief—that I must control, predict, contain—crumbles like ash, and in its place grows something tender and fierce: the understanding that to connect authentically, I must let go. I must trust the unknown, the ebb and flow of another’s soul against mine. I surface, gasping, not from lack of air but from the sheer expanse of this newfound freedom. The figure smiles, a smile that feels like dawn breaking, and as they begin to dissolve back into the lake, they whisper, “Build bridges. Cross them. Burn them if you must. But never stop reaching.”

The lake stills, reflecting a sky now streaked with the first blush of morning, and I stand on the shore again, drenched but lighter than I’ve ever been. My chest aches, not with loss but with possibility, with the thrill of unlearning. I know, as the dream begins to fray at the edges, that I’ll carry this with me—a resolve to challenge my old assumptions, to step into relationships with open hands and an unguarded heart, to embrace the beautiful, unpredictable chaos of truly seeing and being seen.

And as the dream fades, I hear the lake’s ripple one last time, a soft farewell, promising I’ll return whenever I need to remember.
