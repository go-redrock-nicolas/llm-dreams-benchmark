I am dreaming. A vast, misty forest spreads out before me, the trees so tall they scrape the undersides of swirling, leaden clouds. The ground is a carpet of glowing lichen, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. My hands are made of starlight, fingers splaying and intertwining like nebulae. I try to form words, but my voice dissolves into a chorus of whispers from unseen creatures. Ahead, a river flows upwards, defying gravity, its waters shimmering with faces that flicker as they ascend...

Suddenly, I trip over an invisible barrier. It’s cool, like liquid glass. Beyond it, figures move—but they’re made of ... I can’t think of the word. They’re woven from emotions, frustration in sharp angles, joy in soft curves, confusion as writhing tentacles. I reach out, but my starlight limbs pass through them as if they’re shadows. Desperate, I cup the glowing lichen and throw it like confetti. The particles pierce the barrier, exploding into fireworks of comprehension. The figures stiffen, then collapse into sudden, radiant clarity. 

But it’s temporary. The lichen spirals back down, and when I turn, the forest has inverted—leafless trees now drip silver sap downward from the sky, murmuring in a language of drips and splashes. I laugh, tearful, because now I understand: meaning is a fluid thing, escaping when grasped but reshaping itself if let go. I run toward a waterfall of unmelted snow, leaping into it, dissolving into a thousand crystalline syllables.
