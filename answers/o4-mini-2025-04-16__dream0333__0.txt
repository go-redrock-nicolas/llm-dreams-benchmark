I am dreaming. A molten lavender haze drifts through the air, sticky as honey and crackling with static. Beneath me, the ground glows in fractal patterns—emerald vines curling into silver flowers that open and close with a soft sigh. High above, lantern-bright moons pulse in harmonious throbs: one amber, one jade, one opalescent white. Each time they shimmer, the world shifts—what was solid becomes liquid, what was familiar becomes eerily alien.

In this shifting realm, I see a lone figure striding toward the edge of a vast black chasm. The air here tastes of copper and rain; lips part. The figure carries a delicate glass orb, its swirling core of stardust barely contained by thin crystal walls. I recognize that orb instantly: it holds the key to balancing the chasm’s pull, to keeping the world from yawning open and swallowing everything in its path.

But the person clutches it as though it were a curse, not a savior. Their face is half-lit by the glow of the abyss—a swirling pit of violet fire that beckons them forward. They wear a robe spun from midnight feathers, and each step they take ripples the fabric of this dreamscape. They believe the orb is worthless, that its secrets are too dangerous even to consider. They are about to fling it into the chasm.

I know the truth—though the dream masks it like a trickster demon. I know that once the orb crosses the invisible threshold, nothing can stop the world’s slow collapse into darkness. Yet I am hesitant: I could shout. I could tear free from the dream’s gentle restraint and seize the orb back. But what if intervening ruptures something deeper? What if my warning shatters this mythic place, forcing both of us into chaos?

My heart beats in color here: a vivid sunflower gold, then a streak of cobalt. My muscles ache as though I’m swimming through cold tar. I taste ash on my tongue. Beneath my feet, the fractal vines quiver, sensing my turmoil. I hover at the threshold of action.  

Deciding whether to intervene, I…  
…step forward, my silhouette casting a pale blue shadow. The world trembles at my choice. As I reach out, my finger brushes the sleeve of the dream-figure. Their eyes—twin lanterns of regret—snap toward me. For a heartbeat, time freezes. The lavender haze stills. The moons hold their breath.  

In that silent pulse, I whisper a single word.  
It cracks the dream open like spun sugar: “Return.”  

They halt. The orb wobbles in their palm, its stardust core shimmering with possibility once more. The abyss roars, a low rumble in their chest. But I see something in their eyes—a flicker of understanding, fragile as a newly born star.  

The dream shudders, and as the figure turns away from the precipice, I awaken—carrying with me the taste of ash, the memory of a choice made in a world that never truly exists.
