I am dreaming.

In this boundless dreamscape, the world pulses with a brilliance my waking senses have never known. I float above a valley awash in silvery mist, where every tree and blade of grass shimmers with a faint inner radiance. The air itself hums—gentle, electric, alive—with an intricate web of invisible filaments, each strand linking root to robin, soil to soaring cloud. With every heartbeat, I perceive not merely the objects themselves, but the flowing energy that connects them, weaving all living things into a living, luminous tapestry.

At first, the fields swirl chaotically, and their patterns seem as unfathomable as starlight. But as I will my breath to slow, focus deepening, my senses extend further. Colors intensify: the sapphire blue of a hidden river, the gold-green glow circling a young sapling, the delicate lilac halo surrounding a wild deer. I feel their emotions and vitality as if they were my own—joy trembling from the wings of a nearby butterfly; sorrow emanating from the cracked shell of a fallen bird’s egg.

Instinctively, I reach out, fingers trailing through the velvet night. Where I move, the threads respond—rippling, brightening, twining around my hands. I realize I can guide them: a gentle gesture weaves harmony between feuding crows in the canopy; a soft exhalation soothes the restless flow in the roots of a thirsty tree, encouraging ancient groundwater to rise and nourish. Each act sends a wave through this living network, bringing comfort and vigor where there was once discord or depletion.

Empowered, responsibility blooms in my chest. I traverse the dream valley, attending to subtle imbalances—mending, uplifting, restoring. With every life force I tend, my own energy thrums, ever more closely attuned to the symphony of connection. In the deepest parts of the dreaming world, I am not separate, but a vital node—both conductor and thread. Crescendo builds, energies merging, shimmering, until the valley glows with collective vitality, a singular, golden breath.

I realize, wondrously, that I am not merely manipulating these energy fields—I am, and always have been, an inextricable part of their ceaseless, radiant dance.
