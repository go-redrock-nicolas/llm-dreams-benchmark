I am dreaming. # The Whispering Towers of Nyth'Alar

I find myself standing in a metropolis unlike any on Earth—towering spires made of living crystal that hum with consciousness, their surfaces rippling like water when touched. The inhabitants of Nyth'Alar move in graceful, synchronized patterns, their translucent bodies adorned with bioluminescent markings that pulse in rhythmic sequences.

I quickly realize my mistake when I offer my hand in greeting to an elder whose markings glow deepest indigo. The crowd around me falls silent, some covering their chest spirals—apparently their most sacred bodily region. The elder's eyes—three of them, arranged in a triangle—blink in different sequences, communicating something I cannot comprehend.

A child approaches, their markings barely flickering, and gently takes my wrist, guiding it to form a circular motion before my sternum. The tension dissolves as the Nyth'Alarians resume their flowing movements.

I learn that direct eye contact is considered an intimate gesture reserved for family bonds, while thoughts are communicated through light patterns and subtle body positions. Sharing food is not merely sustenance but a sacred exchange of energy—each morsel must be held aloft for three heartbeats before consumption, honoring the spiritual essence believed to reside within.

Most bewildering is their concept of time—cyclical rather than linear—which shapes every interaction. Important conversations begin by acknowledging past and future selves as present participants, creating a dizzying temporal awareness I struggle to maintain.

As I adapt to these intricate customs, I find myself drawn into their communal dream-sharing ceremony, where consciousness flows between minds like water between vessels, and I glimpse the stunning complexity of a culture built on collective experience rather than individual achievement.
