I am dreaming. The world outside my window is a sea of flickering lights, like fireflies trapped in amber.  My desk, cluttered with holographic charts that hum like bees, shows the real problem: The Great Crop Failure.  Across seven continents, the soil has turned to glass overnight—a smooth, obsidian-like substance that cracks underfoot. A message pings on my terminal from the Tower of Babel Network: [Crisis Stabilization Protocol: Initiating Phase Omega-9]  

My name is Dr. Selene Voss, leading the Terra Nova Collective’s emergency council. The air smells of ozone and desperation. Our options are grim. We can deploy the Leviathan Farms—massive vertical farms on the ocean floor—but they require uncontrollable bioluminescent plankton to fertilize the crops. Or maybe we can crack the glass soil with sonic drones, though that might shatter Earth’s magnetic field. Worse, there are whispers of the_idxoid: a shadow BIOS in the planetary core, manipulating this crisis as a test.

My interface flickers, pulling me into a data stream.  Faces of starving millions flash by.  A child’s face lingers—wide-eyed, holding a withered radish. I feel the weight of their hunger in my ribs. The council’s vote is stuck at 48-48. The clock ticks. The glass soil reflects the dying stars.  I stand, my voice steady. “We activate Phase Omega-9.  And we name it—Iris.”
