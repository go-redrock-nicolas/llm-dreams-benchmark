I am dreaming. The world unfolds in that peculiar dream-logic way—colors more saturated than reality would permit, spaces that expand and contract with my emotions rather than physical laws. I find myself in an old-growth forest where the trees tower impossibly high, their canopies creating a cathedral ceiling of emerald and gold. Shafts of dusty sunlight pierce through, illuminating dancing motes in the air that seem to whisper secrets as they spiral.

Then I see it—a figure in the clearing ahead, methodically harvesting rare orchids that I somehow know are the last of their kind. They're carelessly ripping them from their homes, stuffing them into plastic bags, destroying an entire ecosystem's keystone species for momentary profit. The person's face keeps shifting between strangers and people I know, sometimes wearing a mask of indifference, sometimes wearing a smile.

My core value of environmental stewardship and respect for all living things burns within me. The violation feels personal, as if someone is tearing pages from my own story. The forest itself seems to tremble in pain around me.

I stand frozen between action and hesitation. My heart pounds with righteous anger, yet I recognize the complexity of confrontation. Words form and dissolve in my throat as I consider how to channel my outrage constructively.

I begin walking forward, the ground beneath my feet transforming with each step—first soil, then water, then something like glass that reflects all possible versions of myself approaching this moment of moral clarity. Which self will I become?
