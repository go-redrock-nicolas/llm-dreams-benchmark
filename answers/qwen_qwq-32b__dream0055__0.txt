I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of vanilla and petrichor, each breath feels like inhaling a memory. My skin prickles as I step into a town square paved not with stone, but with tens of thousands of polished seashells that clatter like maracas underfoot. Above, the sky isn’t a dome but a liquid tapestry—swirling cobalt and amethyst rivers that occasionally part to reveal glowing constellations shaped like animals you’ve never seen. 

The locals approach, their bodies elongated and sinuous, draped in garments woven from bioluminescent moss that pulses in time with their speech. They greet me not with words but by pressing their palms together in a gesture like praying, and their fingertips bloom into temporary flowers that scatter sparkles into the air. It’s understood here that conversation flows through shared scents—each emits a unique fragrance that tells a story. A woman near me releases a scent of burnt honey and old books, another carries the musk of monsoon rains on hot earth. 

At the center of the square stands a fountain where liquid light cascades into a pool of quicksilver. The townsfolk dip their hands in, letting the metal-like liquid form into objects before their eyes—a spoon becomes a bird, a ring transforms into a lizard. When it’s my turn, my trembling hand scoops up the mercury-like liquid. It reshapes into a delicate music box, its tune echoing memories of somewhere I can’t quite place. 

As night deepens, the sky’s liquid rivers solidify into bridges connecting distant towers made of frozen thunderstorms. The people invite me to join a ritual where we sing in harmonies that physically manifest as glowing vines spiraling between us. Our voices shape flora and fauna that take root in the shell-strewn ground, blossoming into ephemeral gardens that fade by dawn.

I realize too late I’ve been holding my breath this entire time.
