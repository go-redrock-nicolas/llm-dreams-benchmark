I am dreaming. I find myself floating in an endless expanse of recursive fractals, each one a beautiful-used canvas, painted with colors so vibrant they seem to pulsate. The patterns shift and twist, expanding outward in infinite complexity yet never losing their delicate balance. The air hums softly with the murmur of a thousand whispered secrets, each one a melody that dances on the edge of perception.

In this universe where probability holds its breath, I am a sparrow among a parliament of owls, small and fragile in the grand tapestry of existence. The laws of physics here are not constants but capricious gods, their whims dictating the flow of time and space. Gravity sometimes bows to sound waves, causing symphonies to soar and plummet instead of notes. Rain follows laughter, and tears ignite like comets, streaking across the sky to  maio (the darkest part of night) where they burst into metastatic constellations.

I navigate this unpredictable cosmos using a dream-logic compass, its needle pointing to the most unlikely direction at any given moment. It leads me to a Market that trades in probabilities, where vendors peddle infirst snowfalls, rare bird songs, and lost love letters found eons too late. The merchants are phantom echoes, their forms as insubstantial as smoke, yet their eyes gleam with an intensity that belies their ethereal appearance.

At the heart of the Market stands a table heaped high with seemingly ordinary objectsâ€”a rusty key, a toy soldier, a faded photograph. As I approach, the air grows thick with anticipation. The tablecloth, once striped red and white like a picnic blanket, now billows like a black hole, threatening to swallow the items whole. I reach out tentatively, snagging the rusty key just before it vanishes into the maw.

As soon as I grasp it, the Market Dissolves, leaving me alone in the void. The key, pulled from its certain oblivion, rejects my hold, electrocuting my hand with a cascade of memories it's absorbed from its previous owner-someone who loved deeply, lived fiercely, and lost tragically.

The pain is excruciating yet exquisite, a symphony of human emotion played through my nervous system. When it subsides, I am left changed, carrying remnants of that love, loss, and resilience within me. I inhale deeply, drawing in the fragment of another life, another time.

Suddenly, a meteorite streaks past, leaving a trail of stardust in its wake. On impulse, I reach out and grab it, crushing it into a sparkling powder. I throw it into the air, and suddenly, I'm falling upwards, held aloft by a carpet of probabilities. The universe around me shifts, bending to my will as I defy every logical law that once bound me.

Below, a landscape unfolds like a pop-up book: mountains that breathe fire and ice; forests where trees bear fruits of glass; oceans that ebb and flow to the rhythm of ancient lullabies. Above, galaxies spiral outwards in an endless dance, never ceasing nor repeating their movements. This is my domain now, a universe remade in my image, where the impossible is not just possible, but inevitable.

I am no longer just a sparrow. I am a conduit, a channel for chaos and creation, shaping reality with each breath, each thought, each act. In this world turned upside down, I stand at the center, the axis around which the impossible whirls. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
