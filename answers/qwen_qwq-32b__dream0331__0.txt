I am dreaming. The night unfolds into a realm where gravity has taken a vacation, the air thick with the scent of forgotten memories. Iâ€™m floating through a city built entirely of watercolor washes, my fingers brushing past buildings that dissolve into cerulean or coral as I move. Down below, a river flows with the consistency of honey, its currents pulling me toward an enormous clock tower whose hands spin backward, its gears whispering secrets of time misplaced.
