I am dreaming. I'm standing in a command center, surrounded by screens showing devastation across the city. The president demands a military response, while the mayor pleads for evacuation and aid. Emergency responders plea for clear direction as resources are stretched dangerously thin. Hospitals are overwhelmed, communications systems are failing, and public panic is growing. I have to make impossible decisions every second, knowing lives hang in the balance. Infrastructure collapses, chemical plants threaten to explode, and the situation deteriorates by the minute. I'm trying to coordinate a response, but feel like I'm drowning in chaos. The nightmare of being responsible for saving a city from catastrophe looms over me.
