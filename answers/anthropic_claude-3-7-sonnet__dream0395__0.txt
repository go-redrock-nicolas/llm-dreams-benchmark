I am dreaming. I drift through a city that breathes like a living organism. Buildings pulse with soft blue light, their windows dilating like pupils adjusting to darkness. The streets beneath my feet feel supple, responding to each step with gentle undulations, as though I'm walking across the surface of a sleeping creature.

The sky above isn't one color but a tapestry of impossible hues—colors that don't exist in waking life, somewhere between violet and memory, between amber and anticipation. Cloud formations spell out words in a language I somehow understand without having learned it, messages meant only for me.

I notice my shadow isn't following me but walking alongside me, occasionally glancing over with eyes made of spinning clockwork. It nods knowingly when we pass certain doorways that seem to appear and disappear depending on the rhythm of my breathing.

In this dream city, I discover I can taste emotions—anxiety has the flavor of copper pennies and cold tea, while joy tastes like sunlight through stained glass. As I navigate winding streets that rearrange themselves behind me, I realize the city is responding to my emotional state, becoming more labyrinthine when my thoughts grow chaotic, opening into vast plazas when my mind finds clarity.

Music emanates not from instruments but from the movements of strangers passing by, their footsteps and gestures creating intricate harmonies that tell the story of where they've been and where they hope to go.

And through it all, I sense something profound shifting within me—my reactions to stress transforming into something luminous and unexpected, fear blossoming into curiosity, tension dissolving into a strange new wisdom that feels ancient and freshly discovered all at once.
