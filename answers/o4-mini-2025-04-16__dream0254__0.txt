I am dreaming. You are floating, weightless, in a twilight forest of silver-leaved trees whose trunks pulse softly like beating hearts. Mist curls at your ankles, glowing faintly with violet sparkles. Your friend stands before you, pale as moonlight, their eyes rimmed red. In their hand they clutch a small glass vial filled with dark, roiling liquid.

As you drift closer, the ground beneath you hums in low, resonant tones. A wind stirs the leaves overhead, whispering half-formed words you almost understand. Your friend’s shoulders heave, and at last the dam breaks: they cradle the vial to their chest and their voice fractures in a single, wrenching sob.

They confess, voice trembling: for months they’ve been siphoning your dreams—each stolen dream fragment stored in that vial, feeding a silent curse that now threatens to consume you both. Every stolen memory of laughter, every flicker of hope, transformed into that murky elixir. If they don’t return it, your shared future will be nothing but an endless night.

You reach out, breath catching as your fingertips graze their trembling arm. Instantly, you feel a surge of warmth against your palm, like trapped sunlight bursting free. The forest brightens: silver leaves shimmer, the mist parts. All around you, the forest listens, waiting.

Kneeling beside your friend, you gently take the vial from them. It pulses again, as if alive. Their tears fall, each one a tiny star splashing onto the forest floor, where they vanish in sparks. You whisper, voice steady and kind: “We’ll face this together.” With a careful twist of the cork, you tip the vial. The liquid pours out, floating upward in inky tendrils that coil and unravel like dancing smoke. As it disperses, you feel those stolen memories—your childhood laughter in the summer rain, the thrill of first discovery—releasing back into the world.

Your friend leans their forehead against yours. In that moment your hearts beat as one: a steady, gentle drum that rings through the trees. The forest exhales around you; the silver leaves settle, the mist glows pure white. For an instant, everything is peaceful. Then, as dawn’s pale light seeps in at the edges of your vision, you awaken—still cradling the echo of your friend’s secret and the fragile hope you restored together.
