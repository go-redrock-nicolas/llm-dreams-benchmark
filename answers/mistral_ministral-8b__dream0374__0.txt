I am dreaming. The scene unfolds in a grand, opulent ballroom, the kind of place where the air is thick with the scent of expensive perfumes and the hum of whispered conversations. The chandeliers above cast a warm, golden glow over the polished marble floor, reflecting off the gleaming silverware and crystal glasses that adorn the tables.

In the center of the room, a stage has been erected, draped in rich velvet and adorned with elaborate floral arrangements. A crowd has gathered, their eyes fixed on the stage, anticipation buzzing through the air like a live wire. I am standing at the edge of the crowd, my heart pounding in my chest like a drumroll.

Suddenly, the lights dim, and a hush falls over the crowd. A spotlight sweeps across the stage, landing on a figure standing at the podium. It's them, the person who has always been the face of our team, the one who receives the accolades and the praise. They are dressed in a tailored suit, a confident smile playing on their lips as they wait for the applause to die down.

As the applause fades, a voice echoes through the room, "Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we honor the incredible work of our team. This year's award goes to... [Their Name]."

The crowd erupts in cheers, and I feel a pang of something sharp and hot in my chest. It's not anger, not exactly. It's more like a deep, gnawing disappointment, a sense of injustice that's been building up over time. I've been the one working late nights, the one pouring over the data, the one coming up with the innovative solutions. I've been the one making sure the team stays on track, the one who's always there when they need help. And yet, here I am, standing in the shadows, watching them receive the recognition that should be ours.

I try to push the feeling aside, to focus on the speech they're giving. They're talking about the challenges we've faced, the obstacles we've overcome. They're talking about the team, but I can't help but feel that they're talking about themselves. And as they reach the climax of their speech, I feel a surge of something else, something darker. It's a sense of betrayal, of being used and discarded.

But then, something unexpected happens. As they're about to finish their speech, they pause. They scan the crowd, their eyes meeting mine. And in that moment, I see something in their eyes, something that makes my heart skip a beat. It's a glimmer of understanding, of acknowledgment. They nod slightly, a small, almost imperceptible gesture, and then they continue their speech.

The rest of the dream fades away, but I wake up with a sense of unease, a lingering feeling of injustice. I can't help but wonder if they really saw me, if they really understood. And if they did, why didn't they do more to acknowledge my contributions? The dream leaves me with a sense of longing, a desire for recognition, and a deep, abiding curiosity about what the future holds.
