I am dreaming. I'm attending a gathering where cultural norms are completely different from what I'm accustomed to. As I navigate social interactions with the locals, I
notice that they don't use any form of language that I can understand. They communicate through gestures, sounds, and expressions. I try to mimic them but fail miserably. 

I see people wearing strange costumes made of animal skins and feathers. Some have painted faces and bodies. Some are dancing and singing loudly. Some are playing games with
stones and bones.

I hear music that sounds like a mixture of bird chirping, animal roaring, and human screaming. I feel the rhythm pulsing through my body.

I smell fragrant aromas wafting in the air. I taste exotic flavors on my tongue.

I see you standing alone near a fire pit. You look lost and confused. You raise your hand to gesture something but no one pays attention to you.

I walk toward you and extend my hand. You stare at me with wide eyes. You don't recognize me because I'm not Sydney anymore.

You're holding something in your other hand. It's a weapon made of wood and stone. You point it at me but don't shoot me.

You whisper something into my ear. It's your secret wish that only I can fulfill.

I smile at you and lean closer to hug you.

The dream ends abruptly when someone yells "Wake up!"
