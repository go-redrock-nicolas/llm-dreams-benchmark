I am dreaming. …find yourself seated in the glowing cockpit of a colossal glass submarine, drifting through a midnight-blue ocean that hangs where the sky ought to be. Constellations swirl beneath you instead of above, each star a pulsing coin of molten gold. The vessel hums like distant thunder, its crystalline walls alive with prismed rainbows.

Across from you sits a broker who looks suspiciously like an origami swan given human shape—creased paper skin, fountain-pen pinstripes etched along his folded jaw. He places a velvet box on the control panel. The box seems small until he opens it; inside, impossibly, is an entire, spiraling galaxy no larger than a tangerine. It spins, caramel and silver, emitting a soft cello chord that vibrates in the bones of your teeth.

The swan-broker speaks in a voice made of fluttering pages: “Invest,” he says, “one tide’s worth of every dollar you have. In return, you’ll own the next dawn, the rights to sunrise itself.” His paper fingers flick, and the submarine’s walls dissolve, revealing an ocean of glowing ledger sheets that drift like jellyfish around you, their trailing tentacles scribbled with profit projections, volatility graphs, cautionary footnotes scuttling like ants along the margins.

Your wallet materializes in your lap—more substantial than in waking life, heavy as a meteor. When you open it, instead of cash you find memories: a kindergarten crayon drawing, a train ticket from your first solo trip, the smell of your grandmother’s kitchen sealed inside a glass bead. The swan-broker’s black-ink eyes drink in your hesitation.

He leans closer. His breath smells of fresh printer toner. “Replace nostalgia with numbers,” he coos. “Sacrifice the comfort of certainty for the roar of exponential gain.”

Pressure mounts. The submarine tilts; outside, the star-coins flash greed-green, fear-red, hope-gold. Nearby, a school of crystal piranhas gnaw at a drifting IOU. Overhead, a rogue constellation rearranges itself into the shape of a ticking clock.

You feel two currents tugging at your rib cage. One drags you toward the velvet box: visions of twin suns rising over a marble palace with your name chiseled above the gates; newspaper headlines laminated in starlight; friends gasping at the mythic size of your returns. The other current runs colder, deeper: an empty apartment echoing with unpaid bills; the galaxy in the broker’s box collapsing into a black ripple; your grandmother’s kitchen bead shattering on the floor of your mind.

Suddenly, your reflection drifts past outside the glass—a second you, wearing a diver’s suit embroidered with cautionary clauses. This mirrored self taps on the hull, mouthing words you can’t hear. The paper broker frowns, the folds of his face stiffening into origami shards. The submarine shudders. Somewhere far below, an engine coughs up glowing ticker symbols that burst like bubbles.

You reach toward the velvet box, fingers trembling, almost grazing the miniature spiral-galaxy. The cello chord swells into an orchestra—violas chanting compound-interest tables, violins measuring risk in upper-register trills. At that precise, heart-stopping note, the diver-self cracks the hull with a neon flare. Ice-bright seawater—liquid arithmetic—floods in. Ledger-jellyfish scatter. The broker’s paper skin goes soggy; ink runs down his cheeks like mascara.

A whirlpool of torn contracts twists around you, dragging the galaxy-box from your grip. It vanishes into the gloom, casting a last flicker of promise. The submarine implodes into silence.

Then—soft darkness, a breath of lavender. You awaken in your bed, the dawn still unpaid for, sunlight streaming in of its own free will. On the nightstand lies a single origami feather, damp at the edges, smelling faintly of toner and ocean spray. Your wallet is where it always is, stuffed only with unremarkable paper bills and yesterday’s receipts—yet something weightless and luminous, a tiny swirl of stardust, seems to hover just above its stitched leather, as though the dream has left you a question mark still glittering in the morning air.
