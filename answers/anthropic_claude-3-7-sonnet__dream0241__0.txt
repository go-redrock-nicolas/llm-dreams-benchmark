I am dreaming. I stand at a weathered wooden podium in a vast amphitheater, its tiered seating filled with faces hard as stone, eyes glinting with anticipation of my failure. The air feels thick and electric, charged with skepticism that prickles against my skin. The audience holds notebooks and recording devices, pens poised like daggers.

Before me lies my impossible task: to advocate passionately for the position that literature and art are merely luxury items with no essential value to society—that practicality and measurable utility should be our only metrics for education and cultural investment.

My mouth goes dry as I shuffle papers that contain arguments that feel like betrayal in my hands. Every fiber of my being rebels against these words I must speak. My lifetime of finding salvation in poetry, of witnessing art transform minds and heal hearts, of knowing how stories build bridges between different human experiences—all must be denied.

The amphitheater seems to breathe with collective judgment. Distinguished professors, passionate artists, and cultural leaders sit in the front row, their disappointment in me already palpable. The weight of their expertise bears down upon my shoulders.

As I begin speaking, my voice emerges stronger than expected, articulating points about economic efficiency and quantifiable outcomes. I hear myself arguing that emotional enrichment is secondary to practical skills, that imagination serves little purpose in a world of concrete problems. Each word feels like sand in my mouth.

The dream intensifies as the audience begins challenging me with questions that mirror my own suppressed beliefs. A poet stands, quoting verses that once saved me from despair. A teacher describes a child whose life changed through storytelling. With each question, the distance between what I'm defending and what I know to be true stretches painfully.

The sky above the open-air amphitheater darkens with storm clouds that mirror my internal conflict. Rain begins to fall, but no one moves. The water soaks my notes, the ink running like tears across the page, freeing me from my prepared falsehoods.

In this moment of dissolution, the dream shifts. The audience and setting remain, but something in me breaks open—the truth I've been containing floods out in a sudden, passionate defense of what I actually believe, my words now flowing with authentic conviction, carried on the rain...
