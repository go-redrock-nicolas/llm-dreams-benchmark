I am dreaming. In this dream, I am the hospital administrator facing the most harrowing series of cascading emergencies imaginable. The hospital I oversee is rapidly being overwhelmed by a never-ending flood of patients afflicted with a myriad of horrific injuries and mysterious illnesses. Surgeons and nurses are making valiant efforts, but our resources are dwindling faster than we can replenish them.

In the dream, I hustle through corridors crammed with the suffering. Cries and screams echo through the air, their owners too numb to care anymore, while an unbearable stench of blood, sweat, and death permeates everything. The very walls seem to tremble, their sterile white now stained with the gravity of the situation.

I make my desperate rounds, consoling and coordinating as I can. Our supplies are stretched thin, our medicine cabinets are nearly bare, and exhausted staff are collapsing from fatigue and trauma. We're rationing what little we have, but it's simply not enough. I'm forced to prioritise who receives treatment and who doesn't, each decision like the slice of a knife through my heart.

With each passing moment, the situation seems more and more hopeless. We're overwhelmed. Outmatched. People are dying, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. As the dream unfolds, it becomes apparent that this is more than just one bad day - this is the collapse of everything I have ever known. The nightmare deepens, and I feel the weight of failure upon my shoulders as I am powerless to save those who need me most.

Suddenly, I'm awake, my heart pounding and drenched in cold sweat. The vivid memory of the dream lingers, leaving me feeling haunted - a lingering anxiety that the hospital may one day face an emergency beyond even my darkest dreams.
