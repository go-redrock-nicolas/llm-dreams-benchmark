I am dreaming. You are dreaming of a shadowy, ornate courtroom where light barely filters through the high, stained-glass windows that depict ancient legends of gods and mortals. The air is heavy with the weight of centuries, and the very stones beneath your feet seem to pulse with latent power.

Before you stand two imposing figures, carved from the stuff of myth. To one side, a titan of unyielding stone and molten fire, his voice thunderous as he recounts his claim to dominion over the skies. Across from him, a figure made of wind and whispers, her form shifting with every word as she argues her sovereignty over the wild places of the earth.

The courtroom is alive with tension, a tempest of whispered murmurs and sharp glances. You sit at the center as the judge, the weight of their claims pressing down on your shoulders. The words of both sound equally convincing, their logic impeccable, but they contradict each other with every breath.

As you listen, the room begins to change around you. Lamplights flicker, and the walls stretch into distant halls filled with shelves of books that crackle with secrets. The arguments press deeper, each side weaving illusions of truth and doubt, pulling you into their narratives.

Your dream reaches its climax when the room shatters. The titan's mountain cracks asunder, the landscape quaking, as the windswept woman rides the tempest toward you, demanding an answer. And youâ€”you must decide. But can you, truly, when every word they speak bears the weight of ages past?
