I am dreaming. I am looking through the window of a large building, gazing into the ballroom where an award ceremony is taking place. The room is lit with the soft glow of chandeliers; the air is tinged with the scent of lilies and the faint clink of crystal glasses.

I am here, but not. My presence is like a ghost, a silent onlooker, as I watch the events unfold. On the stage, a person stands at the podium, their voice ringing out with pride and accomplishment. As they speak, their gaze sweeps the room, glinting with the satisfaction of a job well done.

But a cold sensation coils in my chest, growing stronger with every word they utter. Their speech is laced with references to a project, one that had consumed my every waking moment for the past year. A project that I had poured my heart and soul into, nurturing it from a tiny seed of an idea into a fully fledged triumph.

As the person on stage continues speaking, I am struck by the realization that they are taking credit for my work. The chill in my chest transforms into a bitter heat, a righteous indignation that demands acknowledgement, credit, justice.

And yet, as the audience applauds and the offender basks in the glow of praise and admiration, I feel the fire in my heart slowly ebb away, replaced by a weighty sadness. I am simultaneously overcome with anger, resignation, and a riptide of complex emotions that I struggle to articulate even within the realm of my own mind.

I find myself grappling with the fundamental human desires for recognition and achievement. I am reminded of how fragile our sense of self-worth can be, and how easily it can be undermined by the actions of others. I am forced to question the value of my endeavors if they can be so easily swept aside, repackaged and presented as the work of another.

As the scene dissolves into a haze and fades from view, I am left with a lingering sense of unease and discomfort. And as I drift further into the depths of my dream, I feel a profound urge to explore these feelings, examine the roots of my own need for validation, and ultimately, to find a way to make peace with the events of this introspective nocturnal journey.
