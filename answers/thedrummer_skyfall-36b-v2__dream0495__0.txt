I am dreaming. You find yourself standing amidst the wreckage of your dreams. The once familiar landscape that brought you solace and purpose is now a barren wasteland, ravaged by the raging winds of time. As you survey the depressing scene before you, your eyesight becomes blurry and filled with tears. You blink, but the tears linger.

Fading into the distance, you hear the whispers of your heart, a sympathetic voice nudging you forward. "Go on," the heartbeat whispers. "There is still time for you to begin anew and reclaim your lost sense of fulfillment."

The voice spurs you on as you march ahead, navigating through the remains of what once was. A bizarre sight appears before you - an old, rusted doorknob, blaring at you. You pause for a moment, and suddenly the warm feeling of nostalgia washes over you.

The doorknob glides open effortlessly, and you spot yourself.. At the other end of this peculiar passageway, you see glimpses of your future self. 
The sight is mesmerizing, leaving you dumbfounded. Your future self is floating weightlessly in an indigo colored galaxy, surrounded by vibrant hues of dazzling stars. The expanse of the cosmos seems surreal, as if it were an extension of your own consciousness.

You recognize that your future self has found purpose and meaning in a way that surpasses anything you have ever known. The energy and enthusiasm emanating from this distant figure are palpable, radiating a profound sense of joy and fulfillment.

As you watch, your future self turns to face you, wearing a mysterious smile. The smile seems to convey an understanding of your current predicament, a silent acknowledgment of the challenges you face and the path you must tread to reach this point.

Suddenly, a wave of empathy and encouragement floods your heart, as if your future self is offering a guiding hand through the murky waters of uncertainty and confusion. The warmth of acceptance envelops you, and you find yourself drawing strength from this connection.

With a renewed sense of determination, you take a step back into the present, bringing the delightful memories of your vision with you. The barren landscape before you suddenly looks different, the path forward now clear and illuminated by the light of your future self.

You know that the journey ahead will be challenging, but with the bond you forged in this dream alongside the vision you've had and the knowledge of what lies ahead, you feel empowered to begin anew. The unknown stretches before you, but you walk into it with courage, knowing that purpose and fulfillment await you on the other side of this transformative journey.
