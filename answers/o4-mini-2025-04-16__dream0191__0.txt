I am dreaming. You are alone in the black belly of the world. The tremors have died, but the cave still trembles in your bones. Your lantern’s glass spiderwebs and the flickering flame guttered out, leaving only the warmth in your palms where it once burned. Endless darkness presses in, slick as wet stone, and each breath tastes of dust and fear.

At first, your heartbeat races—a staccato drum in the void. You raise your hands to your face and feel nothing but rough air. You listen for water dripping or distant wind, any hint of passage. You think of home: morning light through windowpanes, the sound of birdsong—then catch yourself. None of that exists here. Here, the walls are damp flesh and the silence, a beast coiled around your spine.

But then your foot nudges something cool and slimy. You bend and trace the floor with your fingers: a carpet of tiny bioluminescent mushrooms, each one blooming with an inner lantern glow. They pulse softly, like the very heartbeat you thought you’d lost. Hesitantly you cup a cluster, and they wink brighter, lighting the chamber with an eerie jade radiance. Shadows leap back, revealing ancient glyphs carved in the rock—swirling spirals, jagged lines, symbols that whisper of a time before memory.

A low hum vibrates through the tunnel. It’s not the cave, you realize, but the mushrooms themselves—singing in a language of light. You close your eyes and listen. The hum resonates in your chest and fills the hollow there. Your fear, once an avalanche, loosens to a quiet tremor. You remember something a distant teacher once said: in true darkness, the smallest flame becomes wonder.

Guided by the fungi’s glow, you press on. The tunnel slopes downward, and a cool draft brushes your cheek. Ahead, the floor opens onto a subterranean lake so still its surface mirrors the glowing mushrooms overhead as if stars had fallen and settled here. Stepping onto a smooth stone, you crouch to touch the water. It doesn’t chill your hand but hums warmth through your veins. Reflected in its glassy face, your eyes look braver than you feel.

Then, from the far side of the lake, a shaft of silver light pierces the gloom—moonlight, defying the sealed exit. It drifts in through a crack high above, illuminating a narrow spiral staircase carved backward into the rock. Each step is slick but solid. As you climb, the hum of the mushrooms fades behind you. You carry the glow of first wonder in your mind. You rise, you breathe, until at last you emerge into a moonlit glade, the cave entrance yawning shut behind you as if it never were.

You stand under the night sky, star-pocked and infinite, and for the first time in that deep dark, you know what it means to carry your own light.
