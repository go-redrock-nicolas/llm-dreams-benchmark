I am dreaming. **Dream Journal - Entry Unknown**  

**The Clocktower of Liquid Hours**  

I find myself standing at the center of an endless marble plaza, its gleaming surface stretching into a horizon that flickers like a half-remembered thought. The air is thick with the scent of rain that hasn’t yet fallen, and the sky—oh, the sky—it isn’t blue, nor black, but a shifting tapestry of forgotten colors, hues that vanish from memory the moment I try to name them.  

Before me looms an immense clocktower, its face not marked with numbers but with swirling sigils that rearrange themselves each time I blink. The hands aren’t rigid metal but molten, flowing like mercury, stretching and contracting at uneven intervals. And then I realize—the tower doesn’t merely *keep* time. It *feeds* on it.  

A laugh bubbles up within me, wild and unburdened, and as I surrender to it, the world accelerates. The stars overhead streak like fireworks, flowers burst from the cracks in the marble only to wither and regrow in seconds, and my heartbeat thrums in triple time. But then—dread. A thought slithers in: *What if I’m trapped here?* Instantly, everything slows. The air congeals like syrup, my own breath stretching into an echoing groan, seconds yawning into eons. I watch, helpless, as a single dewdrop trembles on the edge of a leaf… trembling… trembling… never falling.  

A figure appears at the tower’s base—a guide? A warden? Their features are indistinct, as though viewed through warped glass, but their voice is honey and thunder. **"You’ve been touching the edges of it,"** they murmur. **"Time isn’t a river. It’s an ocean, and you’re the storm."**  

With that, the dream twists—I’m no longer standing but *falling upward*, the clockface swallowing me whole. Inside, gears of translucent amber pulse like living organs, each turn syncing to the rhythm of my terror, my joy, my longing. I reach out, and my fingers pass through the cogs, stirring memories: A childhood birthday party expands into a decade-long afternoon; a lover’s kiss, once fleeting, lingers for a hundred years.  

And as the dream dissolves into liquid gold, one truth remains—time doesn’t just bend. It *writhes*. And so do I.  

**I awaken… or do I?**  

*(The faintest scent of rain lingers in the air.)*
