I am dreaming. …let your awareness unfurl like a bright ribbon in water.  

First, you peer past the obvious—the glowing moon hanging over a silver ocean, the velvet sand beneath your toes—and sink into subtler ripples of sensation. A breeze brushes your cheek, but now you realize it carries a faint chime, as though each salt-touched gust plucks invisible strings stretched between the stars. The air itself sings.

You pivot, widening the aperture of attention. Behind the dunes rises a forest you hadn’t noticed, its trunks braided from strands of polished glass. Moonlight tunnels through them, splintering into slow, drifting prisms. Every prism contains a miniature sky: tiny clouds roll across lilac horizons, raining specks of opal that fizzle before they reach the ground.  

You step closer, and the crunch beneath your feet is not sand but pages—parchment, warm and breathing. Letters rearrange themselves as your shadow passes, composing half-remembered sentences from childhood stories, then dissolving back into blankness. You kneel, press your palm to a page, and feel a pulse. It races to match your heartbeat, as if the story is eager to be read.

A sudden scent of petrichor lifts your chin. High above, thunderheads coil in bone-white spirals, yet the sky remains clear. You glance again and discover the clouds are enormous moths, their wings latticed with constellations. They dive, scattering star-dust that drifts like slow snowflakes, melting into sparks where they land. One spark kisses your forearm; color rushes under your skin, turning your veins into glowing rivers that braid around your bones.

You test this newfound luminescence: raise your hand, and light streams from each fingertip in five distinct hues—amber, rose, cerulean, viridian, violet. You swirl them, painting sigils in the air. The sigils bloom into windows. Through one you glimpse a city constructed from shifting origami: cranes, dragons, and lotuses fold and unfold themselves into streets and towers. Through another you spy a quiet library where every book spine bears your name, but the titles change with each blink—biographies of lives you never lived.

Curiosity pulls you deeper. You choose the third window, step through, and find yourself floating in the marrow of a gigantic clock. Its gears are transparent planets orbiting an unseen sun of molten gold. Time here does not tick; it breathes, expanding and contracting in tides. Each inhalation of the clock stretches the universe long and thin; each exhalation compresses it into a shimmering bead. You realize you can surf these tides: lean forward to ride a future swell, lean back to slip into the undertow of the past.

Experimenting, you glide forward—a thousand dawns blossom in rapid succession, painting the clockwork in peach and carmine. Children’s laughter echoes, then fades into distant choirs. You glide backward—everything slows until sound itself thickens, like honey poured in reverse. You taste notes of lullabies you’ve never heard, somehow nostalgic.

A voice—your own, yet older—whispers from everywhere: “Remember the corners you never look at.”  

So you turn your attention to peripheral glimmers. In the slim shadow between two gears floats an unassuming seed, matte black, no larger than an eyelash. When you focus on it, the dream around you hushes, as if awaiting your choice. You pluck the seed; warmth blooms in your palm, radiating stories of forests not yet born. Without thinking, you swallow it.

Instantly roots burst from your spine, weaving a lattice that lifts you upward through the clock’s vaulted ceiling. Stone falls away; you emerge into open night, now towering like a graceful cedar. Leaves unfurl from your fingertips, each leaf a lens showing simultaneous scenes: lovers meeting, rivers thawing, cities healing. You feel their hopes curl inside you like new buds.

As dawn breaches the horizon, your tree-form softens, dissolving into a congregation of fireflies that sail back toward the beach where this began. Each insect carries a flicker of insight you gathered by broadening your gaze. They scatter, seeding the world with tiny awakenings: a stranger will pause to admire a weed flowering through concrete; a child will decide to paint the sound of rain; an old friend will make the long-avoided phone call.

Finally, you shrink to one last firefly, spiraling downward. You land on the surface of the moonlit water—yet it ripples not as liquid, but as polished mirror. Your light sinks into its depths, illuminating a reflection that is both you and more than you: a silhouette threaded with galaxies, roots, wings, and patient gears. The reflection smiles, and the mirror-sea whispers, “Keep looking.”  

With that, you wake—eyes wide, heart glowing—carrying the afterimage of a dream that taught you how vast perception can be when you dare to notice what hides in the periphery.
