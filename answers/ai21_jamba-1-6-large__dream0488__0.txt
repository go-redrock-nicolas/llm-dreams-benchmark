I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering ocean under a sky painted with hues of purple and gold. The air is warm, and a gentle breeze carries the scent of salt and distant flowers. As I look out at the horizon, I notice something strange—the water seems to ripple in response to my thoughts.  

Curious, I close my eyes and think of calmness. When I open them again, the waves have slowed to a gentle lapping, as if the ocean itself has taken a deep breath. A soft voice, almost like the whisper of the wind, tells me, "Speak, and it shall be."  

I smile and think of the word harmony. Instantly, the ocean begins to glow faintly, its surface alive with swirling patterns of light, like stars reflected in water. Dolphins leap in the distance, their playful calls echoing across the waves. I feel a profound sense of peace.  

Then, I decide to experiment. I think chaos. The ocean churns, waves crashing violently against one another. The light disappears, replaced by shadows, and the air feels heavier. I tighten my grip on the railing I didn't realize was there.  

Suddenly, a hand touches my shoulder. I turn to see a figure standing beside me—a tall, luminous being with eyes like liquid gold. "You wield a great power," it says. "But remember, the balance is delicate. Thought shapes reality, but feeling gives it life."  

I swallow hard, realizing the weight of the being's words. Slowly, I think happiness. The ocean calms again, but this time it glows with a warm, steady light. I hear laughter and the sound of a distant celebration. The being smiles, nodding approvingly.  

"The key," it says, "is knowing what you truly desire. Speak with intention, and the world will listen."  

As the dream begins to fade, I feel a strange mixture of gratitude and awe. When I wake, the feeling lingers, like the echo of a promise.
