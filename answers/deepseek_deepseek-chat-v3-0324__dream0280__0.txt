I am dreaming. I am dreaming and you are here too.  

The air is thick with golden pollen that swirls lazily between us, catching fire in the beams of dying sunlight that slant through the crooked windows of this abandoned greenhouse. Glass panes, cracked and cloudy with age, filter the light into something soft, forgiving. Outside, the world is veiled in whispers—wind through tangled vines, the distant murmur of a creek, the secret language of birds tucking themselves away for twilight. But in here, there’s only us, and the slow unraveling of words that were never meant to be spoken aloud.  

You sit on the mossy lip of an empty stone fountain, fingers trailing through stagnant water. The surface ripples, distorting your reflection, but I see you clearly—the hesitation in the set of your shoulders, the way your lower lip trembles just once before you steel yourself.  

*"Do you ever feel like you're made of glass?"* you ask.  

It isn’t a metaphor.  

Your skin changes as I watch, turning translucent at the edges, thinning like mist. Beneath the surface, I see things—memories, not organs. A childhood bedroom with a too-small bed. A letter left unopened on a kitchen counter. A hallway that stretches too long, doors slamming shut one by one.  

I reach out—not to touch, because I’m afraid you’ll shatter—but to hover near the pulse at your wrist. I swear I see it flicker, a trapped firefly behind frosted glass.  

*"Tell me more,"* I murmur.  

And you do.  

Each confession strips another layer. The glass fractures in delicate spiderwebs, revealing deeper hues—indigo grief, scarlet rage, the honey-gold of something tender, untested. You tell me about the hands that left bruises buried too deep to bloom on skin. You tell me about the words you swallowed that still scrape your throat when you breathe. You tell me about the love you hid because it was too bright, too much, too real.  

I listen. The air hums with the weight of it. The pollen-dusted light turns liquid, dripping from leaf to leaf like syrup. A single bead lands on your half-transparent collarbone, a burning star against the fragility of you.  

You look up then, eyes shining with something perilously close to relief.  

*"I think,"* you say, voice barely audible, *"I think I'm ready to break."*  

And I open my arms—not to catch you, but to let the shards rain down between us, glittering like fallen constellations.  

Because some things must shatter before they can be remade.
