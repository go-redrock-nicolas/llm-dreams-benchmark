I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast library that stretches beyond what eyes can comprehend. The bookshelves twist into impossible geometries, some volumes hovering in midair, their pages gently fluttering without wind. As I step forward, the marble floor beneath me becomes transparent, revealing not earth but a cosmic ocean swirling with luminous jellyfish-like beings that pulse with knowledge too profound for words.

My hands reach for a book, but it dissolves into a cloud of golden butterflies. Each carries a fragment of wisdom on its wings—certainties I've clung to throughout my life. They flutter away from my grasping fingers, and I feel a momentary panic rising in my chest.

"You always seek to hold truth in closed palms," whispers a voice that seems to emanate from the very architecture. The voice sounds like multiple beings speaking in perfect harmony, neither male nor female, neither young nor old.

I walk deeper into the labyrinth of knowledge, and the shelves begin to breathe. With each exhalation, new corridors form; with each inhalation, familiar paths disappear. My rational mind scrambles for landmarks, patterns, anything to orient myself, but the more desperately I try to map this place, the more bewildering it becomes.

Suddenly, I'm standing before a pool of mercury-like liquid that reflects not my face but all my possible selves—paths taken and untaken swirling together. I kneel beside it, and as my fingers hover above the surface, I understand: certainty has been my prison all along.

The moment I embrace this thought, the library transforms. The books, the shelves, the cosmic ocean below—all melt into a luminous fog that surrounds me with gentle, pulsing light. Within this fog, possibilities bloom like night flowers, each containing universes of potential understanding.

I open my arms wide, surrendering to not-knowing, and feel myself becoming boundless, merging with the dream itself, a living paradox: most certain when embracing uncertainty, most knowledgeable when acknowledging ignorance, most present when releasing the need to define what is real.

The fog whispers, "This is where wisdom begins."
