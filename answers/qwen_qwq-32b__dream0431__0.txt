I am dreaming. I find myself in a dimly lit forest with trees whose bark shimmer like liquid silver under the faint glow of a half-moon. The air feels thick and heavy, each breath carrying an earthy scent of wet soil and pine. From a distance, I hear a mysterious melody, a blend of a flute and the whisper of wind. As I follow the sound deeper into the forest, the trees grow denser and the path less clear until I reach a clearing where a figure is playing a celestial harp.

The figure turns, and I recognize it as a version of myself from years ago—the me who experienced the injury. The sound of the harp shifts into a sorrowful, haunting tone, and the me from the past starts weeping. As I stand there, my own emotions surface—the anger, the hurt, and the lingering resentment. 

I step forward and gently place my hand on their shoulder. Instantly, the harp transforms into a rainbow-colored butterfly that flutters upward into the sky. The younger me smiles, and with that, I feel the weight begin to dissolve. The forest around us brightens, flowers bloom at our feet, and the air fills with the laughter of unseen creatures. 

When I wake, I am left with an overwhelming sense of clarity and a quiet whisper in my heart: "Forgiveness is not forgetting. It's the gift you give yourself to release the poison intended for others."
