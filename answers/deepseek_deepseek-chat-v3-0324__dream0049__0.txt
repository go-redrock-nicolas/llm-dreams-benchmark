I am dreaming. Gradually, the world around me softens and blurs at the edges, as if reality itself is melting into watercolor. The air hums with a faint, electric buzz, and I realize—with a thrill—that I can *combine* things. Not just stack or glue them together, but truly *fuse* them, weaving their essences into something entirely new.  

First, I reach for a pocket watch left on a sunlit windowsill and a handful of dandelion seeds plucked from the breeze. The moment they touch, the watch’s brass casing shimmers like liquid gold, swallowing the seeds whole. The gears inside sprout delicate, feathery tendrils, and suddenly, the watch *blooms*—its face opening like a flower to reveal not numbers, but shifting constellations. When I hold it to my ear, it doesn’t tick. It *whispers* the time in the voice of the wind, forecasting not hours but the arrivals of distant storms and the births of faraway stars.  

Emboldened, I snatch a teacup from a nearby table and press it against a moth fluttering too close to a candle. The porcelain shudders, then turns translucent, its surface rippling like a liquid mirror. The moth’s wings dissolve into the glaze, etching themselves into the cup’s sides—now delicate, veined, and pulsing faintly with bioluminescence. When I pour water into it, the liquid doesn’t steam. It *sings*, a soft, humming lullaby that curls into the air like smoke.  

Laughing, I grab a violin resting against a chair—but before I can find something to merge it with, the floor beneath me *breathes*. The wooden planks twist into roots, and the walls stretch upward into a cathedral of living bark. The violin’s strings shiver, then snap free, slithering like vines around my wrists. The instrument groans, warping, its body splitting open to reveal a hive of glowing, musical bees. They swarm in harmonic formations, their wings playing symphonies as they weave between my fingers.  

I realize, with dizzying delight, that the dream isn’t just letting me *invent*—it’s *alive*, responding to my thoughts before I even touch anything. The world itself is eager to reshape, to *play*.  

And just as I reach for the moon spilling through the window, intending to fold it into a handful of scattered marbles, I wake—  
with the taste of starlight still on my tongue.
