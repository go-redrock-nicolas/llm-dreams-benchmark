I am dreaming. In the haze between wakefulness and slumber, I find myself in the corridors of my workplace, but everything is distorted and shadowy. The once familiar fever of a vibrant office is now an oppressive blanket of dread as I pad silently down the hallway, the squeak of my shoes echoed, like a menacing alarm. 

I arrive at my cubicle, only to find it in disarray. Papers strewn about, files haphazardly piled. As I gingerly sort through the mess, a sickening realization dawns on me. They're all mine, but the contents have been twisted, manipulated. The projects I've poured my heart and soul into, now marred by subtle errors and misplaced information.

A shadow flickers at the edge of my vision and I whirl around, my heart pounding. There, leaning against the wall with a smug smirk, is my colleague Sam. The one I've mentored, trusted, and even considered a friend. In the dream, his face is distorted, twisted into a grotesque parody of the person I thought I knew.

"You did this," I hiss, my voice trembling with a blend of anger and betrayal. "Why?"

Sam's laugh echoes, hollow and menacing in the quiet of the office. "It's nothing personal," he spits, taking a step closer. "Only business. You've been coasting on your laurels for too long, and I'm tired of living in your shadow."

I can feel myself tremor as his words pierce my core, fueling the flames of my fury. "But why like this?" I demand, gesturing to the havoc he's wreaked in my workspace. "Why undermine everything I've worked for?"

"Because it's the only way to move up in this dog-eat-dog world," Sam sneers, his eyes glittering with malice. "And I plan to do whatever it takes to get to the top, even if it means knocking off a few peas from the top."

As Sam throws his head back in a cruel laugh, I feel a rush of power surge through me. I won't let him get away with this betrayal, this sabotage. With a roar of frustration, I lunge forward, determined to confront him once and for all.

But just as our dream-selves collide, a blaring alarm breaks the nightmare, transporting me abruptly back to reality. I jolt awake, my heart pounding and skin slick with sweat, the echoes of Sam's twisted laughter still ringing in my ears.
