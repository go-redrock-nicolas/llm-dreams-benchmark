I am dreaming.

A thousand small suns are bursting above the horizon, each refracting colors I’ve never had names for—shimmering violets with edges of green fire, rivers of molten gold pouring across an endless sky. I am standing at the edge of a cliff, but the rock beneath my feet is warm and breathing, pulsing with life, as if the earth itself is resilient and endlessly renewed.

I remember the long shadow behind me—the vast, bleak desert I walked through, where sandstorms howled like lost souls and hope flickered to a whisper. I thought I would never emerge. Yet here I am, blinking in wonder at this surreal sunrise, marveling at how the scar on my heart has not just healed, but blossomed into a living tapestry wrapping my chest. Each thread glows, stitched from every night I refused to give in.

I walk forward, feeling light as air. My footsteps send waves of color rippling across the ground—frosted lavender, stippled indigo, glowing coral—spreading beauty with every tentative step. I see a garden ahead, impossibly lush: trees grow upside-down, dripping fruit into shallow lakes of mirror-bright water. Insects hum songs that tangle in the air like ribbons.

As I sit beneath a tree whose roots weave up and around like a cradle, I look down into the lakes. Reflected there, I see not just my face but my entire story—etchings of sorrow, yes, but also radiant lines of laughter and courage. I am struck by the realization: the setback was part of my becoming, a single, thunderous chord in the symphony of my life. I needed to break, to be poured molten and reshaped by adversity, to become something more intricate and beautiful than before.

In this vivid dreamscape, resilience is not merely recovery—it’s transformation. The past’s heaviness has become fertile earth for impossible gardens. With every exhale, I send ripples shimmering into the new day, astonished at my own power to rebound and rise, again and again, into something miraculous.
