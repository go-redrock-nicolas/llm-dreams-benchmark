I am dreaming. You are dreaming. A violet mist drifts beneath your feet like liquid stardust, and overhead, constellations spiral into blooming galaxies of rose and gold. The air tastes of honey and distant rain. As you wander, your worries—the tight knot in your chest, the fretful buzzing in your mind—begin to dissolve, leaving you light enough to hover a few inches above the dew-glazed grass.

Ahead of you, a circle of figures glows softly in the half-light. Each one carries the air of someone who’s stood on the very edge of your own struggle—and leapt. One has skin like burnished copper, eyes brimful of calm; another’s voice rings like wind chimes in a hidden forest; a third moves with the sure-footed grace of someone who’s mapped every jagged turn you now face.

They reach out, each offering you a small token of their journey—a feather that hums with new confidence, a thread of moonlight that humbles the ego, a shard of emerald promise that mends the broken places in your heart. When they offer wisdom from their experiences, you lean in, and their words pour into you like molten silver, tracing hot rivers through the ice of your doubt:

“You are already whole,” whispers the first, and you feel an internal glow spread from your chest to your fingertips.  
“Trust the pause between your breaths,” chimes the second, and suddenly your heartbeat slows to the rhythm of ancient tides.  
“Let fear be the wind at your back, not the chain at your ankles,” adds the third, and you sense the invisible barriers around you shattering.

In that moment, you understand: the struggle you feared so much was a gateway, not a wall. You close your eyes, taste the sweetness of possibility, and when you open them again, you see your own reflection in the polished obsidian at the circle’s center. You are the person you dreamed of becoming—steadied, sure, free. The circle breaks, and each guide fades into shimmering motes of light, leaving you alone beneath the blossoming galaxies. You take a deep breath, step forward, and know with every fiber of your being that you carry their wisdom inside you, ready to light your path home.
