I am dreaming. I find myself walking through a forest that seems to breathe with its own consciousness. The trees tower above me, their bark spiraling in impossible patterns that shift when I'm not looking directly at them. The air is thick with a luminous mist that tastes like memories—some sweet, some bitter on my tongue.

As I walk deeper into this living labyrinth, I notice a figure walking beside me. Without turning, I recognize them instantly—their presence as familiar as my own heartbeat. We walk in perfect rhythm, our footsteps creating harmonies in the moss beneath our feet. Each step releases tiny spores of light that float upward through the mist.

For what feels like hours or perhaps just moments, we traverse this dreamscape together, sharing unspoken thoughts that manifest as colorful birds darting between the trees. I feel complete in their company, my spirit lifted by their presence.

But gradually, something shifts. The birds become heavier, their wings labored. My companion's footsteps fall out of sync with mine, creating dissonant echoes. The light between us dims, and I notice I'm carrying a glowing orb that pulses weaker with each step.

With sudden clarity, I understand: what once was a mutual exchange of energy has become unbalanced. Their silhouette now seems to draw from my light rather than contributing its own brilliance. The realization doesn't come with anger, but with a profound sadness and recognition.

At a clearing where the forest opens to reveal a sky filled with twin moons, our paths diverge. Words aren't needed—the forest itself seems to acknowledge this necessary parting. As they walk toward one horizon and I toward another, I feel the orb in my hands growing brighter again, its warmth returning to my fingertips.

The mist swirls around me as I continue alone, yet not lonely. The trees now whisper ancient wisdom: some connections are meant for seasons, not lifetimes, and honoring their natural conclusion is an act of love for both souls.
