I am dreaming. I'm standing backstage in a grand auditorium, my heart thundering against my ribs as I glimpse the audience through a slim opening in the velvet curtains. The room is filled with the subtle rustling of expensive suits and perfumed air - CEOs, venture capitalists, industry pioneers - faces I've only seen on magazine covers and news broadcasts. This presentation will either catapult my career into the stratosphere or become my most public failure.

The leather portfolio in my hands feels unusually heavy. Opening it, time seems to stretch as I discover with mounting horror that my meticulously prepared slides have transformed overnight. Graphs point in impossible directions, statistics contradict themselves, and my careful research has morphed into nonsensical jargon and children's drawings. One page appears to be covered in hieroglyphics; another shows only a crude sketch of a cat wearing sunglasses.

A voice announces my name, each syllable echoing with terrible finality as applause ripples through the audience. The spotlight finds me as I step onto the stage, its heat intensifying the beads of sweat forming at my temples. The first row contains my childhood heroes, my current boss, and inexplicably, my third-grade teacher who always said I'd amount to nothing.

My mouth goes desert-dry as I reach the podium. The microphone emits a piercing whine that makes several audience members wince. I open my portfolio again, desperately hoping the contents have somehow corrected themselves, but now find only blank pages and a single Post-it note that reads "Good luck!" in unfamiliar handwriting.
