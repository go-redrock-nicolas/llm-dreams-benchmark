I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt lavender, a fragrance that clings to your skin like a memory you can’t quite place. Around you stretches a landscape that defies logic: a desert of liquid mercury, its surface rippling with the reflections of every failure you’ve ever known. Each step you take sends shockwaves through the silver ground, and with every tremor, the faces of your past mistakes rise like ghosts from the depths—cracked glass masks, hollow-eyed and whispering in languages you once spoke fluently.  

You’ve walked this way for eons, it seems. The horizon is a jagged scar, bleeding twilight hues of bruised plum and smoldering tangerine. Behind you, the failures pile into a mountain of shattered clocks, rusted keys, and paper boats soaked through with ink that refuses to dissolve. You don’t look back. You can’t. The weight of them is a storm at your heels, a howling thing with teeth made of regret.  

Now, ahead, the final obstacle looms: a tower of living shadow, its spire piercing a sky filled with stars that scream as they’re born. The structure breathes, its walls undulating like the ribs of some primordial beast. Staircases spiral upward in impossible geometries, folding into themselves, vanishing into mirrors that reflect nothing. To climb it would mean confronting the thing you’ve buried deepest—the fear that your heart is a hollow drum, beating only to mock the silence inside.  

You touch the tower. It recoils, hissing, and the ground beneath you fractures into a thousand floating shards of obsidian. Each shard holds an image: a childhood dream abandoned, a love left unsaid, a door left unopened. You step onto them anyway, your feet bleeding ink as you balance on the edges of your own history. The tower’s voice grates like tectonic plates colliding. *“You are not enough,”* it growls. *“You never were.”*  

But you laugh—a raw, ragged sound—and the shards tremble. You laugh because you’ve heard this lie a thousand times, in a thousand forms. You laugh because the pain in your chest isn’t emptiness; it’s the echo of every time you chose to keep going. The tower shudders, its shadows fraying at the edges.  

Higher now. The air is liquid nitrogen, freezing your lungs with every breath. The stairs dissolve beneath you, replaced by a rope made of your own hair, stretching into a void where time unravels. You climb, hands raw, fingers slipping, until you reach a door of frosted glass etched with the words you’ve whispered to yourself in the dark: *“Not today. Not ever. Not again.”*  

You push through.  

Inside, the tower’s heart is a cavern of mirrors, each one showing a version of yourself that never was—a warrior, a poet, a ghost, a god. They all reach for you, their reflections cracking as you pass. At the center, a throne of thorns cradles a single, pulsing light: the truth you’ve carried but never claimed.  

You take it.  

It burns, of course. It sears away the armor of your doubt, the scar tissue of your defeats. You feel yourself unraveling, then stitching back together with threads of starlight and the sound of distant waves. The tower collapses into ash, the desert evaporates, and the screaming stars fall silent.  

You wake as dawn bleeds through the cracks in the world, your skin humming with the memory of fire. The failures are still there, waiting in the corners of your mind—but now they kneel, bowing to the thing you’ve become: a story not yet finished, a storm that refuses to be stilled.
