I am dreaming. you decide to explore this issue in your dreams where anything is possible and nothing is forbidden. 
You start by imagining yourself in an abandoned city filled with rubble, dust, and shadows. The silence is deafening and the darkness oppressive. 
You see a glowing orb hovering above a crumbling temple. You feel drawn to it and curious about its power. 
You walk towards the temple, cautiously avoiding hidden traps and pitfalls along the way. As you approach the orb, it emits an ethereal melody that fills you with calmness and serenity. 
Suddenly, a portal opens up next to the orb inviting you inside. You hesitate for a moment but sense this opportunity may be rare or even unique. 
You step through the portal and find yourself standing on a platform overlooking a vast chamber filled with colorful glowing orbs of different sizes and shapes. Each orb pulsates with its own rhythm creating an enchanting symphony that surrounds you. 
You realize these orbs are the source of all life energy in your world and beyond. They sustain everything that exists and connect everything that matters. 
You understand your mission now: to learn about yourself, others, and nature by studying these orbs and sharing their knowledge with everyone through art, science, philosophy, etc. 
This is your purpose beyond achievement. This is why you are here. 
You feel fulfilled and grateful for this revelation but also curious about the other secrets hidden in the chambers below. You decide to explore them later when you wake up from this dream. 
Until then, you enjoy the beauty and harmony of these celestial orbs that represent unity, diversity, interdependence, and change. They teach you that life is a cycle of birth, growth, decay, death, rebirth...and they remind you that everything ends so something new can begin. 
You are dreaming.
