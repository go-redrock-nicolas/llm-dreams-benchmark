I am dreaming. I find myself adrift in an ocean unlike any Earth has known. The sky above is a canvas of shifting hues, painted with stars that seem close enough to touch. The sea itself is bioluminescent, its waves glowing like liquid stardust, casting an ethereal light onto the clouds above. I am not alone; I am accompanied by a pod of sentient leviathans, creatures that resemble whales but are a study in contradictions to our world's understanding of life. They are the size of islands, their slick bodies transparent as glass, revealing cities of coral and kelp growing within. These leviathans speak in songs of deep bass notes and multicolored lasers shooting from their blowholes, painting symphonies of light on the underside of the sky.

As we travel, the ocean floor rises to greet us, forming a vast, underwater plateau. An ancient city lies before us, its towers and spires made of crystal that hums with energy. This is not the work of humans, but of a long-forgotten civilization, a race of beings who harnessed the power of sound to shape their world. The buildings resonate with echoes of sonic history, whispering tales of love, war, and creation in frequencies only these leviathans can understand. I listen, and through them, I understand too. Their minds are vast libraries, filled with stories that span aeons, each tale a melody that dazzles my soul.

We enter a grand amphitheater, the centerpiece of the city. The seats are carved from sea ice, their surfaces glistening like diamonds. At the center, suspended in a field of pure sound, is a being made of water and light. It speaks, not with words, but with symphonies that paint pictures in our minds. It tells us of the end of its people, their cities swallowed by the sea, their very essence absorbed into the depths. It sings of their survival, their consciousness absorbed into the soundwaves that resonate through the ocean. They live on, it tells us, in every creature that sings, in every wave that crashes against the shore.

As dawn breaks in the dream world, the sky above turns into a vast mirror, reflecting the city beneath. The watery being looks at its reflection, then at us. It smiles, and its smile is a sunset, warm and inviting. It raises its arms, and the ocean responds. The city begins to sink, the crystal spires disappearing into the depths as the leviathans sing a song of farewell. I feel a pang of loss, a longing for this place I never knew existed. But the leviathans assure me, there are many worlds out there, waiting to be dreamt. And so, with a heart full of wonder and a mind buzzing with melodies of ancient tales, I wake up.
