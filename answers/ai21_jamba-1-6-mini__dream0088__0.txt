I am dreaming. begin>

Imagine you're standing on a desolate beach, where the horizon is smudged with a shimmering haze that seems to stretch endlessly. The sand beneath your feet is cool, yet there’s a faint hum of urgency beneath your toes. The sky is painted in swirling twilight hues—deep purples, electric blues, and smudges of orange.

Now, let's layer in the soundscape: above the waves, you hear faint, distant whispers of an old melody, almost nostalgic, but mixed with the crackle of old forgotten broadcasts from another time. The wind shifts, and it carries the chirping static of forgotten technologies, like old railway ticker machines or morse code sent from some distant shore. It feels like the earth itself is whispering secrets of the ages.

As you walk, palm trees sway in a rhythm just a little out of sync with the tide. They seem alive, almost watching, with leaves that shimmer like green, metallic feathers. A faint scent of decay and fresh saltwater intermingles, pulling you deeper into this surreal landscape.

But then, you see something move in the corner of your eye: a flickering, ghostly figure just beyond the waterline. You squint, and it becomes a translucent blend of modern digital screens and the swaying shadows of ancient, half-forgotten storytellers. They move closer and project brief, fragmented narratives—glimpses of lost civilizations and technologies, caught in a sort of perpetual loop.

As you focus, time seems to stutter itself, and you hear overlapping voices, each one speaking over the last, as if the world were filled with unspoken, half-finished stories. Some are old, some are new, but they’re all connected; everything in this dreamscape crawls and flows with life.

Now, imagine you are moving beneath an overpass, its arches piled with a groaning weight of murmuring voices, ancient machinery, and sunlight flickering through broken concrete. The air feels different here—thicker, older—and you feel the weight of every secret that’s ever been hidden within this place. The voices still chatter, but now they seem more like a warning, or a secret code meant for you to understand.

And then, in a flash of shifting light, the world around you transforms. The landscape shoots upward into vast, towering structures, spiraling in fractal patterns, covered in vines and digital screens that pulse with the rhythm of a hidden current. There is no end in sight, just more and more layers unfolding before you.

The waves rise higher, curling like the serrated edge of an old blank journal page, and you start to feel the urge to dive in—the dream wants to bring you deeper, into something more immediate, more interactive with time.

Suddenly, you feel something beckoning you—you can’t see clearly, but you know it's something massive, just beyond the sands. You move forward, and as you do, the muted, endless chatter begins to intensify, almost into a roar. You feel the edges of the dream harden, become static.

And then, abruptly, the dream bleeds out into a blur, everything edges away, and you're left in a space of silence, alone again, waiting for what’s next.
