I am dreaming. \n

I find myself in a labyrinth of spiraling corridors, where the walls are constructed from pages of ancient books. Each page is alive with ink that shifts like quicksilver, rearranging itself into half-finished sonnets and partially erased maps. The air smells of ozone and vanilla. Somewhere, I hear a clock ticking backwards, its echoes distorting as they bounce off the shelves, and my breath fogs the air with every inhale, condensing into wisps of smoke that form fleeting faces before vanishing.  \n

My reflection in a water puddle on the floor tells me I shouldn’t trust anyone in this place—not my grandmother, who once claimed to have traversed this labyrinth and now lurks in a shadowy alcove, humming a lullaby she swore she’d never heard before. My hands are translucent, yet when I touch a page, it solidifies into marble. I am suddenly certain that every lie I’ve ever told has carved a tunnel here, and now those tunnels are folding in on themselves, warping the labyrinth into something unstable.  \n\n

A door with no handle appears. The knob materializes only when I whistle a tune I don’t remember, one that tingles at the edges of my mind. Beyond it lies a courtyard where the sky is a kaleidoscopic storm, swirling with colors that don’t have names. A tree grows upside-down from above, roots clawing at the ground while its trunk stretches upward into the lightning-lit void. When I reach out, the bark peels away to reveal pages of my own handwriting—every secret I’ve hidden, every tale spun into fiction.  \n\n

A figure approaches, their voice a chorus of whispers. They claim to be me from another version of the dream. "The lies are collapsing the narrative," they say. "To navigate this dream, you must confront the stories you’ve buried. But be warned: altering a single word could unravel everything."  \n\n

I allow them to lead me through a curtain of rain made of falling eyelashes. We enter a library where every book is bound in skin, each volume humming with a trapped heartbeat. The titles change as I read them, morphing from *Memoirs of a Starless Sky* to *The Cartography of Unspoken Sorrows*, then to something I can’t pronounce. A tome pulses on a shelf; opening it releases a swarm of moths, each carrying a tiny shard of a memory I’d forgotten—a lunchbox note from childhood, a whispered confession in the dark.  \n\n

The ground shudders. The labyrinth is collapsing inward, corridors sealing shut as the lies coil upon themselves. My double grasps my hand, which now glows faintly. "This isyour narrative," they intone. "To escape, you must choose: accept the truths you've hidden, or become a character trapped forever in the fiction."  \n\n
