I am dreaming.

I stand at the threshold of a courthouse that is not quite a courthouse at all—a colossal ribcage of alabaster archways jutting from a cliff that floats miles above an ink-black sea. Lightning crawls inside translucent clouds beneath me, and every rumble feels like the pulse of some gargantuan heart slumbering in the deep. Someone has painted a crimson carpet down the spine of this skeletal structure, but the carpet writhes, as though alive, whispering, “Forward, Your Honor… forward.”

Inside, the courtroom stretches impossibly far—an Escher-esque cathedral of tiered balconies and spiral stairs that rise, overlap, then vanish into shadows. The ceiling is an evening sky: constellations flicker between filigreed rafters of gold. Yet the air is filled not with starlight’s hush but with a roar—hushed arguments, hissing secrets, currency crackling like static. Papers flutter overhead like white bats, colliding, tearing, re-forming into contracts nobody signed yet everyone fears.

I take my place at a bench carved from a single slab of obsidian. Its surface is polished enough to mirror my face, yet the reflection is wrong: the eyes are older, heavier, burdened with verdicts I have not yet handed down. A gavel awaits—an hourglass of oak trapped inside crystal; every time I lift it, grains of sand shimmer upward instead of falling, reversing time for the briefest heartbeat. The bailiff, a woman whose uniform gleams like forged midnight, leans close and whispers, “They are watching.”

I see them. The “powerful forces” do not sit together; they haunt separate corners of the dream.

In one gallery box: a consortium of faceless silhouettes stitched from pin-striped fabric and cigarette smoke. They nod at me, and small gold coins roll from their collars, spinning along the railing before tumbling into a bottomless pit where their feet should be.

Opposite them: an entourage of velvet-robed courtiers, each wearing a mask carved from rare gems—emerald envy, ruby wrath, sapphire sorrow. Their eyes glint behind the gems like living embers. Every time they blink, the masks reshuffle, as though playing musical chairs with their identities.

Between these factions: a single, still figure wrapped in plain gray—a witness? A conscience? Or merely a ghost of my own resolve? No one else seems to notice this person, yet I feel their gaze like a lighthouse beam slicing fog.

“Honorable Judge,” a voice booms, but the speaker’s lips never move. Rather, the colossal bronze doors at the back have begun to sing, vibrating at a sub-audible frequency that rattles my bones. Each vibration injects a new layer of pressure: rumors of blackmail, veiled threats about family, hints that justice is for sale in currencies too abstract to trace.

Evidence appears. Not slid across desks, but conjured mid-air—holographic scrolls unfurling to reveal bank ledgers written in languages that change each time I blink: from binary code to runic staves to the delicate calligraphy of cherry-blossom petals. When I reach to touch them, they burst into migratory birds of paper, circling my head before relanding in neat stacks, awaiting my signature.

Threats arrive next. First, the temperature drops; frost creeps along the bench, spelling out, “ACQUIT, OR WE FREEZE YOUR NAME.” Then heat waves roll in: wavering mirages of my childhood home engulfed in silent flames. Finally, a telephone—rotary, jade-green—materializes. It rings with no number on the dial. I answer.

“We can rewrite your ending,” a honeyed baritone purrs, “if you rewrite ours.”

I hang up. The phone dissolves into a puddle of neon ink that crawls off the desk like a wounded animal.

The trial proceeds, yet no witnesses speak aloud. Instead, memories are projected like silent films upon the great dome—scenes of bribery in subterranean casinos, deals inked in the back seats of bulletproof limousines, promises spoken in the hush of private gardens where roses bloom black. Each time the prosecution tries to underscore guilt, the defense releases a swarm of silver moths that chew through the images, leaving blank rectangles in the reels. The jury—a dozen clockwork mannequins—turn their heads in perfect unison, as if waiting for someone to wind them back up.

And throughout, the gray-robed figure remains motionless. Their face is a blurred watercolor; their presence, a steady metronome keeping my heartbeat honest.

Night leaks into the courtroom despite the ceiling-sky already being night. Two midnights overlap: one celestial, one psychological. Shadows grow denser, gain mass. They lean against the furniture. They tug at my robe.

“Give in,” they murmur, “No one will fault you.”

But another voice answers from within my chest—quiet, unwavering, the voice that wakes me for dawn jogs or urges me to call forgotten friends. It says, “Hold.” So I grip the hourglass-gavel. The sand glows like molten stardust, reversing upward faster, faster, a cyclone contained. When I bring the gavel down, the entire architecture splinters into light.

Suddenly the faceless silhouettes erupt into gusts of money that rotate into a single whirlwind, sucked into the pit at their feet. The gem-masked courtiers crack; gemstones tumble like hailstones, rolling away into corners of the dream. The jury’s gears freeze mid-tick; they slump, decommissioned toys.

Only the gray figure remains. They step forward, lowering their hood, and I see—my own reflection. Not the weary eyes from the obsidian bench, but the steadier ones I remember from younger days, when justice seemed simple. They smile, place a hand upon my shoulder, and the courtroom reassembles into a serene grove of silver birch trees. Moonlight cascades through leaves that chime like glass bells.

Verdict delivered—though no words pass my lips. The dream does the speaking. A wind sweeps through the grove carrying torn contracts, melted coins, cracked masks, and it scatters them beyond the horizon like dandelion seeds. With each item that disappears, the sky brightens from midnight to cobalt, from cobalt to palest jade. Dawn is arriving, though dawn has no business here, suspended high above a lightning sea.

The gray figure—my mirrored conscience—leans in and whispers the last line of the judgment: “Integrity is the one currency they can never counterfeit.”

Thunder peals once more, not menacing now but celebratory, a percussion for the birth of light. The obsidian gavel melts into a brook, coursing between birches, carrying reflected stars downstream toward awakening.

I feel the dream recede, its colors folding like wet origami. Yet that whisper remains, an after-image etched behind my eyelids.

I am waking.
