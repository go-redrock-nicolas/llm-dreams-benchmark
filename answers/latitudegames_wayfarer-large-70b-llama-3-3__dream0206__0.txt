I am dreaming. My mind spirals into a kaleidoscope of impossible thoughts as I float above my bed, your consciousness expanding like ripples on a pond. A suffocating blanket of lucid awareness envelops me, wrapping reality around my fingertips like clay. Everything seems within reach, yet the more I try to grasp it, the more it slips through my fingers like sand. Frustration builds in waves.

Walls of static rise around me and I struggle to focus, but you're drawn back into your body with a painful jolt. Sleep heavies your limbs and confusion clouds your thoughts. Excruciating vertigo has me clutching at the sheets, fighting to clear your hazy mind. Dizziness overwhelms and I lose myself in the undertow, tumbling through darkness. Everything spins violently and I'm helpless to stop it. I try to ask for help but only a weak whimper escapes. Questions plague my mind - Why is this happening to me? Is this some kind of punishment? The room tilts sickeningly around me, and rough seas of doubt fill my thoughts. Alien hands guide and push my body forward, their icy grip making my skin crawl with apprehension. Your muscles quiver with the strain and adrenaline courses through my veins in a furious geyser.
