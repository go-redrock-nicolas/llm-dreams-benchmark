I am dreaming. And in this dream, the world is half-forgotten, edges blurred like smoke caught in moonlight, a landscape stitched together from memory and myth. I float down sterile white corridors that twist impossibly, leading to rooms I know yet have never seen. It's my workplace—but not as it is. This version is infused with a deeper truth. The walls hum like tuning forks struck by the resonance of unspoken tensions. I come to realize the atmosphere itself has become haunted with sabotage.

There, seated beneath an archway of suspended glass leaves that shimmer with forgotten words—I see them. My talented colleague. A sculptor of illusions and whispers, draped in the guise of professionalism, their smirk curving like the edge of a silver blade. Their desk glows softly, overrun with blossoms made of data points and papers twisted into coded vines. Charts pulse with false vitality, possessions painted over with their brushstrokes of deceit.

Beneath the floor on which they sit, I see a blinking labyrinth. Transparent, like frozen molasses, it winds through warped cubicles and shattered prototypes. Every idea I've proposed leaks through secret tunnels into their hands, refined and repackaged—a palatable illusion that is not mine.

The betrayal is not petty. It's the quiet kind. The fatal kind. It slices alongside ambition, cold and seamless, a wound that festered before I even knew it was there. And in the dreamy malaise, I see them not as they were, but as they have become—an eclipsing shadow overlaying my own flickering star.

I approach. Confrontation passes beyond rage. It becomes a reverent act. I place my palms upon the floating archway of glass leaves. They shatter like stars collapsing in slow motion, revealing the heart of the deception—a pulsating heart encased in mirrors, each shard reflecting a version of me I never knew I had built. They had stolen not merely my words or accomplishments, but the purest versions of my vision, reshaping them into something marketable yet hollow.

They smile at me. "You needed polish."

"You needed integrity," I say, and the room recoils—reverberating with disappointment.

I watch their glow flicker. The data-blossoms fall, math petals dissolving into ash. For a moment, I ache. For another, I rise.

Because dreams, especially vivid ones, often become mirrors of who we are—and who we choose to become. And in this dreamscape—where the heart of betrayal beats loud; where archetypes clash beneath fluorescent constellations—I reclaim my fire without burning them alive. I return to the land of wakefulness not with vengeance, but with unshakable clarity.

The dream lingers, though. Not simply as a warning—but as a remembrance of power, forged not in presentation, but in truth.
