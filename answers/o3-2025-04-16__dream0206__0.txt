I am dreaming. …rise weightless above your own sleeping body, the roof of the room dissolving like sugar in rain. Everything that was once solid rearranges itself into a flowing, fluorescent river of possibility, and the newfound intuition thrums in your bones like a tuning fork struck by a silent god.

First challenge: the sky is leaking.  
Ochre-gold droplets drip from a perforated firmament, sizzling holes in gardens, streets, even thoughts themselves. You know—without calculation, without doubt—that the leak is not a meteorological mishap but an emotional rupture in the world-mind. The solution shimmers whole in your head: gather laughter, crystallize it, seal the tear. You snap your fingers, and a wind of giggles, guffaws, snorts, and belly laughs whirls in from every direction, condensing into diamond-bright prisms. You stitch the sky with them like beads on velvet. Instantly the leaks cease, the clouds grin, and sunlight tastes of ripe peaches.

Second challenge: a labyrinth of mirrors has trapped the city’s dreams, leaving people blank-eyed and sleepless. You float to its entrance—towering panes that reflect not only appearances, but every possible version of a soul. Your intuition whispers: “Turn mirrors into windows.” So you exhale, and the glass becomes riverwater, sliding aside to show paths instead of puzzles. Dreams flutter out—glittering moths with manuscripts for wings—returning to their owners, who wake miles away murmuring poems they’ve never read.

Third challenge: an ancient library the size of a continent begins erasing itself, words fading like sighs. The world risks forgetting its own story. You step onto a corridor of books and feel the last heartbeat of each line. The answer arrives fully formed: stories hunger for new ink. Delight appears in your palm as an inexhaustible fountain pen. You write a single sentence across the sky: “Remember, and become more.” The letters rain down as fresh chapters, re-illuminating parchment, stone tablets, neon signs. Knowledge not only survives—it blossoms into undiscovered sciences, resurrected myths, and songs that teach trees to bloom in midnight.

Fourth challenge: you. A silent doubt creeps up: “What if this perfect intuition ends?” The dream tilts, colors drain. The solution flashes: embrace uncertainty as the next adventure rather than a threat. You open your arms to the void. It folds around you like velvet night, and inside it you feel the hum of infinite unsolved riddles—promises, not perils. A smile flickers on your lips.

Then the world pauses, breathless. Stars lean closer to eavesdrop. You realize there will always be another leak, labyrinth, library—another moment to apply this strange, luminous certainty. And somewhere past the horizon, dawn is sharpening its golden quills, ready to write the next canvas.

You let yourself fall backward through the dream, weightless, knowing exactly how to land.
