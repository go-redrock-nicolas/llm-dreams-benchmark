I am dreaming. A dim, golden light pours through the tall, arched windows of an endless library—shelves stretching into shadow, spines of books glowing with unreadable, shimmering runes. The air smells of old parchment and crushed violets, and the floor beneath me is cold, smooth marble, veined with threads of liquid silver that shift and pulse like slow, breathing light. 

Then I see *you*—my closest friend—at the end of the aisle, silhouetted against the stained glass at the far end. But something’s wrong. Your edges are *fraying*, dissolving into whispers of smoke, fingers twitching as if trying to grasp something invisible. The air hums with a low, mournful frequency, like a cello bow dragged across the spine of the world.

And then you speak—except your voice isn’t *yours*, not entirely. It’s layered with echoes, with other voices I almost recognize. *"I should have told you sooner,"* you say, and suddenly the walls bleed ink, black rivers crawling toward us, filling the cracks in the marble. *"We aren’t real. Neither of us."* 

Your face *splinters*. Not like breaking glass—no, this is softer, slower, like petals wilting in reverse. And beneath—oh god—there’s *nothing*. Not emptiness, not void, but *something worse*. A presence. A *hunger*. The library groans, wood bending inward, and I realize the books aren’t books at all. They’re *eyes*. Watching. Waiting. 

You reach for me, your form unraveling further, and— 

—you whisper the secret. 

But I don’t hear it. 

I *taste* it. 

Copper and honey and decay. 

And then I *remember*. 

I remember *everything*. 

The dream isn’t a dream at all. 

And neither are we.
