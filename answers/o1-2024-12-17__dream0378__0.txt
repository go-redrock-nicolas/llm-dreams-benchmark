I am dreaming.

It is twilight when I first glimpse the distant city: an enormous latticework of jewel-toned arches and shimmering spires that seem to float over a turquoise lagoon. The structures, though reminiscent of grand castles, are shaped in such a way that each tower is topped with an intricate spiral swirl—like the twisting of a conch shell—verdant vines curling around translucent balconies that hum with sparkling lights. Silhouetted against the pale, lunar sky is a civilization entirely unlike any I have known.

I soon realize I have somehow arrived at the border of this land, standing ankle-deep in warm, glimmering water. The lagoon is luminescent. Every step I take yields a puff of radiant silt that bursts with a silvery glow. Gazing down, I catch my reflection for a moment—yet I look no different from myself. Nervous excitement stirs in my stomach, for I know I have never set foot here before, never so much as read or heard about these people. I can feel the gentle, rhythmic pull of a foreign breeze lifting my hair, carrying from the capital a melody unlike any song I know. Its notes sound half like wind chimes, half like an unearthly choir calling in gentle pulses.

As I wade forward through the shallows, I notice a group of tall, willow-limbed figures beckoning to me from the water’s edge. Their skin is rippled in faint patterns like swirling clouds, and their clothing—if I can call it that—seems grown from living fibers that gracefully twist in colored bands around their forms. Rather than speaking outright, they use measured gestures: a delicate tilt of the head indicating greeting, a flutter of their slender fingers signifying gratitude or deference. Now and then, a soft hum resonates from deep within them, swirling in the air as though the hum itself were a tangible thread of communication.

One of them calls to me in a language that sounds like the wind dancing through reeds. A wave of anxiety ripples through my heart, but I will not let it stop me. Realizing I can hardly mirror their greeting as gracefully as they do, I attempt a respectful nod. The figure who first approached me seems unoffended, though some in the group appear intrigued—or perhaps amused—by my nervous attempt. Slowly, the group ushers me forward, onto the sand-packed paths leading into their city.

Their streets are not made for a human gait: they spiral and branch in ways I cannot initially comprehend. Where I would expect clear boundaries between personal space and public areas, they seem to have a more fluid sense of territory, often stepping into one another’s rhythmic dancing circles and drifting away just as seamlessly. Private and communal spaces are woven, ephemeral, one blending into the next with no doors or locks as I know them. It is both beautiful and disorienting.

As I walk, the newness of it all heightens my sense of wonder. Overhead, the sky is a cascade of purple and minty green stars that shoot across the horizon in slow arcs, like languid comets. A hush moves through every tower as these celestial visitors pass, and the people—these dreamlike beings—bow their heads in reverence, briefly silent. It feels sacred, yet I do not know the right gestures. My every learned behavior—for instance, crossing my arms in neutrality or smiling to politely greet strangers—suddenly feels alien, possibly even offensive here. So I fix my eyes on my guides, trying to emulate their respectful posture …

They lead me to a courtyard, where the ground is laid with polished rose-quartz tiles. I spot a shimmering fountain at the center, its water gurgling in a rhythmic, musical pattern that produces gentle chiming notes. Entire pathways of tiny flowering shrubs, each one shaped like a spiral shell, swirl around the fountain. People (or perhaps I should call them citizens of this realm) move in a continuous, artful dance, arms swaying as they pass by one another. The shifting, swirling footwork is mesmerizing. I feel as if they are all part of a single living tapestry, weaving in and out among themselves. 

Then, the tallest of my escorts moves forward to greet me personally. I watch these beings instruct me through graceful gestures: a gentle hand offered palm-down means “Would you walk with me?” A slight tilt of the elbow is an invitation to converse, carried out through subtle humming or a series of hooted sounds that ring like a flute. When I try to respond, my voice comes out a bit clumsy, and my guide’s features flicker with a patient smile—at least, I believe it is a smile in their culture.

In my heart, I struggle not to impose my own perspectives. I yearn to see their rituals, to observe, to adapt. In some distant part of me, I recall that in cross-cultural encounters, it is all too easy to read significance into gestures that may mean nothing of the sort. So I tread gently, noticing their willingness to teach me even as I fumble. Every time I pause or hesitate, the group responds with gracious understanding. It seems they have a special reverence here for those who wish to learn.

I am guided into an archway leading one level higher, where I witness a gathering—perhaps a communal meal. The tables are shaped like crescents, arranged around an open hearth that shines an iridescent glow. People are seated on low, cushioned pods that sway like air-filled bubbles when you settle on them. Bowls made from enormous translucent shells contain morsels of shimmering fruit, each piece shaped as though it were carved by the sea. Curious but cautious, I watch how they eat, each with measured, ritualistic gestures, pausing often to offer a hushed note—just a single melodic tone—before taking a bite. It seems to be a sign of gratitude or reflection. Inspired by their gentle reverence, I repeat a soft humming note of my own before sampling the fruit, which is unexpectedly sweet and tangy all at once, its flavor blossoming in my mouth like honey spun through glowing stardust.

Over the course of this communal dining, I begin to loosen, to harmonize my body language just enough that the difference between us feels smaller. The language barrier still stands, but they appear not to mind; they answer my clumsy attempts to speak with gentle hums of encouragement, guiding me like a patient teacher. Rarely have I encountered a culture so cooperative and kind with a stranger. Yet in their expressions, there is also curiosity, a question that seems to glimmer in their large, glistening eyes: “Who are you, and what do you bring to us?”

Eventually, night descends fully— if one can call it “night” in a realm blanketed by dancing auroras. I notice the inhabitants retreating into a spiral staircase carved around the edges of a tall, glassy tower. The surfaces glow in coral-like patterns, lighting the stairs from within. As I climb higher and higher with them, the air grows lighter, tasting of gentle breezes and dew. There is a hush among us, as though they are preparing for a collective slumber or meditation. 

At the tower’s pinnacle, the floor is ringed with cushions, each turned toward an expansive window. Outside, iridescent fish drift through the lagoon waters below, leaving floating trails of white luminescence. Everyone finds a seat, and I follow suit, unsure if I should hum, kneel, or speak. Then the tallest guide gently touches my shoulder, leading me to a cushion near the window. The older ones, whose hair-like tendrils are diffusely colored like clouds at sunset, form a circle in the middle of the floor, softly chanting something that creates a serene resonance in the tower. It rolls over me like waves of calming energy, reminding me of songs long forgotten. 

I close my eyes, uncertain if I’m meant to join in, but I feel the presence of these people around me, encouraging my immersion in their sacred circle. My breath steadies, my mind quiets, and for a moment, I sense something intangible yet comforting, as if the barrier between us lessens. Our differences are still vast, but the wonder of honest connection makes them feel like stepping stones rather than impassable walls. Here, in the cradle of this foreign culture, I have found acceptance, patient guidance, and a willingness to share their unique way of being.

As the chanting subsides, I open my eyes, only to see the faintest rays of a new dawn glistening over the horizon. In their tradition, no one cheers or claps; instead, they offer a whisper of gentle, rippling hums—their version of applause or renewal. My guide smiles again, that serene, knowing expression, and I feel in my heart that I have taken a small but meaningful step toward understanding.

Then, soft as gossamer, I feel the pull of reality calling me away from their realm. The tower’s lights shimmer in and out, becoming hazy, like a candle flickering in a breeze. I glimpse the lagoon as it reflects the rising sun, and right as everything begins to swirl into a kaleidoscope of color, I hear a final, melodic chorus from the inhabitants, wishing me farewell in their gentle, humming voices.

I awaken with a start, my mind filled with echoes of violet spires and hums that yet sing in my ears. The memory of the kindness in those large, luminous eyes lingers, and so does the feeling of being a student in someone else’s sacred place. Though all around me is now my familiar world, that dream, and the lessons of humility and open-heartedness it carried, remain as bright as the lagoon’s shimmering waters.
