I am dreaming. My eyes flutter open to a world hewn from shattered glass and liquid starlight. The ground beneath my feet ripples like mercury, reflecting fractured glimpses of faces I can't quite recognize—or perhaps don't wish to. A cathedral of icicles looms overhead, each dripping neon blues and poisoned purples that sizzle where they strike the ground, releasing whispers that curl into smoke-lettered pleas: Guide us. Save us. The very air crackles with potential, static raising the hairs on my arms as a dozen pairs of eyes—opal-irised, lidless, burning—swivel toward me. My pulse hammers in time with distant thunder as I lift a hand, and the shattered sky bends.
The ground shivers in response to my movement, mercury waves coalescing into obsidian steps beneath my bare feet. Above, the cathedral groans as icicle spires realign into spiraling archways, their neon drips now pooling into living ink that writhes upward into shadow hounds with constellation pelts. They circle me, not growling but humming - a harmonic resonance that rearranges the floating debris of broken planets orbiting our battleground. The crowd of lidless beings press closer without moving, their elongated fingers raised in unison as if holding invisible strings attached to my ribcage. I exhale and taste copper, realizing the whispers now manifest as cursive scars across my palms spelling ancient verbs in a language that scorches as I read: command, shatter, remake.

Distant thunder solidifies into a helix of stormclouds spilling backwards, defying gravity to feed the forming maelstrom behind my eyes. My left hand closes around the scar-verb for "command" and it ignites into a torch of liquid sunlight, its rays piercing through three floating monoliths that materialize midair - one bleeding hourglasses, another oozing molten keys, the third pulsing with trapped lightning. The shadow hounds howl in reverse, their soundwaves knitting the fractured sky into a tapestry depicting all possible tomorrows. I reach for the burning keys just as the ground gives its first true command - a seismic roar that shapes itself into a single word reverberating through every mirrored shard: *Now.*
