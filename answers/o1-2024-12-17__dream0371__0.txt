I am dreaming. You are in a gleaming palace of knowledge nestled between towering, crystalline mountains that reflect the pale moonlight in luminescent shards. Soft echoes of distant contraptions hum in the cool night air. You came here believing you possessed every shred of valuable expertise—an understanding of arcane sciences, advanced technologies, timeless wisdom gleaned from centuries of study. These columns of polished marble and swirling glyphs stand as testaments to your accomplishments—except tonight, you see your library of achievements has inexplicably turned to dust.

You wander the enormous corridors, heart pounding, as you behold shelves that once held your precious tomes reduced to empty archways. Lion-faced sconces flicker with pale blue fire, revealing tablets of shimmering energy etched with mysterious new formulas you’ve never encountered. An entire wing of knowledge has blossomed overnight, containing revelations far beyond your comprehension, rendering your once-vaunted expertise suddenly obsolete.

An uneasy blend of awe and fear twists within you. Your identity—so entwined with the mastery of these once-coveted skills—feels shaky as the plaster of your old reality crumbles. Yet, in this moment, you surrender to the truth: the world is always evolving, and you can cling to the ruins or flow into the future.

With trembling hands, you step into the newly formed wing, letting your curiosity guide you. Each floating tablet is a puzzle that reignites dormant sparks of wonder. Your fingertips graze glyphs that shimmer and rearrange themselves into luminous patterns, beckoning you to explore and learn anew. Though your hard-won knowledge now feels like a whisper of lost antiquity, the thrill of discovery swells within you like a sunrise over jagged mountaintops. 

In the midst of this dreamscape, you reclaim your sense of purpose by becoming a learner once again: open-eyed, open-hearted, ready to reshape your identity. As the spectral dawn filters through vaulted glass ceilings, you feel reborn—undaunted that everything you knew before has transformed into seeds for a new beginning.
