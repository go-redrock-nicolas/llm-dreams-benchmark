I am dreaming. The air hums with an eerie, liquid stillness, thick as syrup, pressing against my skin. I stand in a city of glass—towers like frozen waves, their surfaces rippling with reflections that don’t quite match the world around me. My footsteps echo, though I don’t remember walking. In my hand, I hold a knife. No—not a knife. A key. Or perhaps both, shifting form at the edges of my vision.  

A voice that is mine yet not mine whispers, *You need this. You’ve always needed this.*  

Around me, shadows congeal into figures—faceless, but I know them. They are the ones I’ve sworn to protect, to uplift. Yet here, in this mercury-lit dreamscape, I am pulling something from them. Not their possessions, not their bodies, but something finer, something essential. A shimmering thread, like light caught in spider silk. With each pull, they dim. The key-knife grows warmer in my grasp.  

*Hypocrite,* the air hisses. *You take what you condemn.*  

A mirror appears before me. My reflection doesn’t blink. Its eyes are hollow, not with emptiness, but with a hunger—a vast, gnawing void where my principles should be. The face is mine, but the smirk is foreign, viciously satisfied.  

*This is who you are when no one is watching.*  

The dream shudders. The glass city cracks, fractures spreading like veins. The key-knife melts, scalding my palm, and I scream—  

—and wake with my own gasp, sheets damp, the taste of copper and guilt sharp on my tongue.  

For a moment, the line between dream and self feels terrifyingly thin.
