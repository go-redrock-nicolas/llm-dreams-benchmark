I am dreaming. The vast expanse of your unfolding imagination transports me to a beautiful, serene garden. The lush green grass beneath my feet contrasts sharply with the vibrant colors of the blooms scattered throughout. As I breathe in the sweet fragrance of the flowers, I feel a deep sense of tranquility.

Suddenly, a gust of wind carries an unfamiliar scent, stirring a sense of unease within me. The garden begins to shift and transform. The sun dims, and shadows creep over the once-vibrant landscape. Amidst the tranquil setting, I notice a small, fragile-looking bird, its wings tucked close to its body as if in fear.

A flicker of anger rises within me. I want to protect the bird, but an external force prevents me from doing so. I feel myself becoming increasingly agitated and trapped. The bird represents my suppressed anger, and my inability to act is the cage that confines it. It appears defenseless and unable to spread its wings.

As my frustration grows, the bird's characteristics begin to shift. Its frail features morph into something more powerful and fierce. The once timid creature now embodies the fury within me. I realize that by acknowledging and embracing my anger, I empower myself to transform it into a force of strength and resilience.

Understanding the significance of what I'm witnessing, I watch as the bird spreads its wings and takes flight. Along with it, I feel my own ability to confront and channel my anger into positive change. I awaken from this dream with newfound clarity, aware of the power within me, urging me to face my emotions boldly and constructively.
