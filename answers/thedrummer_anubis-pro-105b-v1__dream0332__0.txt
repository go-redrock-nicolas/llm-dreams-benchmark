I am dreaming. As I dream, I find myself in a barren wasteland, the sky above a swirling vortex of grey and red, ominous storm clouds roiling with electrical crackles. The air is thick with an unsettling, pungent smell of smoke and ozone. I try to move, but my legs feel heavy, as if they're trapped in a pool of viscous tar.

Suddenly, a figure materializes in the distance. It grows larger with each passing moment until I realize it's a mirror image of myself, but with sharp, pointed horns protruding from its head and eyes that glow like molten lava. The mirror-me begins to speak, its voice a melody of discordant notes that grates against my eardrums.

"You've been led astray, my faithful counterpart," the entity declares. "The truths you've held dear for so long were nothing more than clever deceptions, chasing shadows instead of substance."

The creature lowers its head, and with one sweep of its horned finger, it creates a tear in the sky, revealing a kaleidoscopic tapestry of images. I see peers I trust uttering platitudes that now strike me as shallow and misleading. Prominent figures whose words I once revered now spew discordant rhetoric, their words dripping with poison and malice.

I look to my own hand and see that it's penetrated with splinters, each shard representing a different tenet I've often expressed. The mirror image slowly pulls back the splinters one by one, and with each painful tug, I feel my structure destabilize, my very foundation crumbling. It opens its mouth and vomits out a never-ending stream of raw data and statistics, contradicting everything I thought I knew.

In the dream, I try to shield my face, overwhelmed by the onslaught of fact after fact that chips away at the walls of my perception. I see how disgusted the world around me looks at my narrow-mindedness, how my unquestioned beliefs are tearing it apart. I feel myself growing smaller, crumbling into dust and soon disappearing altogether.

To my relief, my mirror image vanishes, and I wake up.
