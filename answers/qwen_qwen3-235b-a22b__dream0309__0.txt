I am dreaming. I am standing in a house made entirely of mirrors — walls, floor, ceiling — all of it reflecting endless versions of myself.  Each mirror is slightly warped, contorting my reflection into fantastical shapes and sizes.  Some reflections show me as powerful and triumphant; others depict me as small and insignificant, my eyes hollow, my hands trembling.  The most unsettling thing is that all of these reflections move independently of each other.  They smile and frown, shout and whisper, dance and fall — all doing different things, all claiming to be *me.*  

The air feels thick, quivering with a strange kind of static electricity, as though thoughts are being formed directly in the atmosphere. A low hum vibrates in my bones, the tone is constant but somehow always shifting, like there’s a message trapped within it.  Desperate to understand, I reach out toward one of the mirrors, expecting the cool, smooth touch of glass under my fingers. Instead, the surface ripples like liquid silver and my hand passes through.  

Suddenly I'm no longer in the mirrored house, but walking on the surface of water. Beneath me lies a city, shimmering like liquid gold. Skyscrapers rise upward in graceful spirals, casting long shadows across the crystalline surface of the ocean.  I realize, with a pulse of awe, that the city is alive — its buildings responding to my movements, growing taller with my confidence, shrinking as doubt gnaws at me. In the distance, I see a figure sitting atop one of the towers — a woman wreathed in light, her face partially obscured.  She's familiar, painfully so, and yet my brain cannot place her. She smiles faintly, her eyes filled with something close to sorrow, as though she's watching a scene play out that she already knows the ending to.  

I begin to walk faster toward her, but the water becomes dangerous, churning beneath my feet. Shapes form beneath the surface, too many to count — faces I recognize, voices overlapping in a cacophony that blends with the low hum from before. They all seem to be arguing, though I can’t understand the words. Then, one voice cuts through the noise like a blade.  

“You got lucky,” it says flatly.  

I freeze, the breath catching in my chest. The voice sounds like my own — not the confident, trained projection I use in meetings or on stage, but the fragile, honest tone I use only in the privacy of my mind, late at night. I know the words are directed at me, but I also *feel* them — as though I’ve thought them myself, only to Banish them to the back of my consciousness where they fester in silence.  

“No,” I whisper, though the word barely forms. I start walking again, faster now. The waves get higher, crashing against my ankles, spraying saltwater on my face. I can barely keep my balance, and I feel as though the surface will give way at any moment, plunging me into the golden city below.  

“Stop pretending,” the voice says again. It’s sharper now, harsh. “You’d be nothing without the breaks. You weren’t special. You weren’t better. You were just... lucky.”  

The mirrored reflections, the city beneath the water, the light-clad figure on the tower — everything begins to shimmer, as though stuck between dimensions. I try to push the voice away, but it resonates in my bones. I feel tears prickling at the edges of my eyes. Everything I’ve worked for, the struggles I’ve endured, the pride in thinking I’ve forged my own destiny — are these all lies? Have I just been coasting?  

A second voice joins the first, warmer somehow. It’s a voice I’ve heard before, long ago, and entirely trustworthy. “Luck or not,” it says quietly, “you *were here too.*”  

The words stun me. I stop moving entirely, as the water beneath me calms again, the city’s shape becoming clearer. Just as I’m about to respond, the light-clad woman on the tower lifts her hand and gestures toward me. The hum I felt earlier rises in volume, clearer now, like a long-forgotten song. Suddenly, all of the mirrored selves begin to fade, their reflections dissolving into light. The ones I trusted most vanish first — the confident trionpher, the bold performer, the great leader — until only the hollow-eyed reflection, the trembling one, the one that whispers doubts, is left.  

The light grows brighter, until I can see nothing but it. The voice returns, gentle and unrelenting:  

“You wore those masks to build yourself. But the truth is in the cracks between — in the moments you *had* to show up because no one else would.”  

The golden city seems to pulse with life now, not in response to my pride, but to my fear. I realize the truth: it’s not about what I accomplished, it’s about what I learned by climbing, falling, and climbing again.  

“I wasn’t nothing,” I whisper. The voice hums its agreement, and the light begins to swirl, lifting me up, up, away from the city and the water.  

And then I wake..modify()
