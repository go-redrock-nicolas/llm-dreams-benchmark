I am dreaming. **You are dreaming.**  

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and late-night jasmine. A cobblestone path, glowing faintly beneath a waning crescent moon, winds ahead into an endless expanse of velvet-shadowed woods. At your back—dimly familiar, rapidly fading—is the world you’ve left behind: deadlines, checklists, the hollow echo of delayed gratification.  

But here, the path is alive. Every step you’ve taken is illuminated in fleeting streaks of blue bioluminescence, pulsing beneath the stones like submerged lightning. Some glow fierce and bright—days when progress felt triumphant, inevitable—while others flicker weakly, nearly extinguished: the forgotten mornings you hit snooze, the nights doubt whispered *why bother?*  

Then, halfway, the light sputters.  

Ahead, the path forks. One side dissolves into mist, soft and beckoning, lined with specters of abandoned ambitions: that half-finished novel’s crumpled pages, a rusted guitar with snapped strings, a language left unpracticed until the words evaporated. Each one murmurs in your mother’s voice, or your first love’s, or your own—*It’s not too late to quit. Who would even notice?*  

But the other fork…  

A figure crouches there, not human but shape-shifting—sometimes a fox with galaxies tangled in its fur, sometimes a child stacking rocks into wobbly towers. It doesn’t speak, only pushes a single glowing pebble toward your boot. When you lift it, images surge through your fingertips:  

— **A hand calloused from sketching**, flipping through a year’s worth of daily drawings;  
— **Your future self**, not triumphant but *content*, sipping coffee in a sunlit kitchen built by skills you haven’t earned yet;  
— **The visceral shock** of looking back and realizing *you* were the obstacle, the only one keeping you from the alternate reality where you’d given up.  

The pebble melts into your palm, searing cold. The path ahead isn’t brighter—but now, with every step, the stones hum a slow, stubborn rhythm: *Not for them. For you. For you. For you.*  

You wake clutching your pillow, heartbeat synced to the fading echo. The dream lingers like a scar—or a promise.
