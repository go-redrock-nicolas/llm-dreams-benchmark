I am dreaming. It's so vivid, I'm very aware of where I am.  I'm on a crowded subway train traveling through some unknown city.  The noise of the rails reverberates throughout the car as it trundles down the dark tunnels.  Passengers are packed in, standing shoulder to shoulder, holding onto the rails above their heads, or the poles in the middle of each section.  The car rocks back and forth in a steady rhythm as it continues its journey through the darkness.

Suddenly, without warning, all the lights go out and the train stops between stations.  Fear grips the crowd as darkness engulfs them.  The sounds of panic fill the air.  Gasps of horror, panicked chatter, confusion and fear flee through the air, bouncing off the walls, muffled only by the pitch black surroundings.

As the panic begins to spread among the passengers, you feel a sense of calm wash over you.  The darkness that once seemed oppressive, you now find comforting.  You reach out with your senses, feeling the sounds of the people around you, smelling the scents of the city.  Slowly, a soft glow fills the car, emanating from you.  The panicked passengers begin to calm as the light fills the space, casting an eerily beautiful hue on everything it touches.

You stand up and make your way to the front of the car, the light growing with each step until it illuminates the entire train.  As you reach the driver's cabin, you put your hand on the door and it swings open.  You step inside and take a seat at the controls.  The train hums and comes alive with power, the tracks ahead glowing a luminescent blue, creating a path of light into the dark tunnel ahead.

The passengers stare in awe as you navigate the train with a deftness that seems almost otherworldly.  They continue on their journey, safe in the knowledge that they are in good hands.  The train glides along the tracks, in and out of stations, the light from inside the car spilling out onto the platforms, illuminating the faces of the waiting passengers who look on in wonder as the train passes by.

Eventually, you arrive at your destination.  The train comes to a gentle stop and the doors open.  The grateful passengers step out onto the platform, blinking as their eyes adjust to the sudden light.  They look back at you, wanting to know who you are, needing to understand what just happened, but the words escape them.  You simply smile and wave as the train pulls away from the station.

As the train leaves the station, bound for another adventure, you wake up.  The dream fades from your mind, a fleeting memory, but the feeling of peace and calm remains.  You smile, knowing that somewhere, somehow, you made a difference, even if it was only in a dream.
