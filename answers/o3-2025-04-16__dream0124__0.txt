I am dreaming. …I lift my eyes and watch tomorrow retreating into yesterday like a silver comet, its tail a river of un-written memories sliding back into the dark. Hours un-tick. Sunlight un-rises, folding itself into a violet horizon. I realize that in this place every consequence reaches out first, and only afterward do I feel the spark that birthed it.  

To put one foot “forward,” I must start with the footprint that will already exist in the sand. I concentrate on the cool impression of that footprint—there it is, waiting—then allow my muscles to unwind the step that was destined to create it. My leg rises after it lands; my balance corrects itself before it ever falters. Walking feels like reading a sentence whose letters leap back onto the pen as you finish the thought.

I try to speak. The echo answers me first, then rolls back into my throat as breath. Words drip upward like ink lifted from parchment, arranging themselves into unborn feelings in my mind. If I wish to greet someone, I first listen to their returned salutation floating through the air in reverse. Only then do I taste the consonants melting inward, un-forming on my tongue.

Hunger approaches me as sudden satiety. A plate empties itself of crumbs, rebuilding a warm, fragrant loaf slice by slice. I swallow the calm glow of being full; moments later the soft bread slides whole from my mouth to my hand, steam coiling inward toward the crust, and finally settles un-bitten upon the tablecloth that has just unfolded.

Rain rises from mirror-bright puddles, stitching itself into clouds that drift backward across a charcoal sky. Thunder implodes to a whisper, and lightning retreats into the bellies of cobalt thunderheads, leaving blackness un-scorched. I see the rainbow first, then watch its colors siphon off the horizon and funnel into a single drop that darts into the cloud bank like a jewel returning to its box.

Whenever I wish to accomplish anything, I must cradle the ending in my palms and let it surge into its unborn beginning:

• To light a lamp, I find the warm glow already dancing on the walls. I cup that glow, feel it dim until the room is dark, and at last hear the click of the switch beneath my thumb.  
• To paint, I gaze at a completed masterpiece radiant upon the canvas. I study every hue retreating into my brush, every line collapsing gently into pale linen until the surface is blank. Only then does the palette grow heavy with untouched color.  
• To comfort a friend, I first sense the calm smile that will come after tears. I cradle it like a blossom in winter, let it fold into sorrow in their eyes, then open my arms to receive the grief that has already been healed.

I notice constellations drifting in reverse across the velvet firmament, rewinding mythologies. Orion sheathes his sword, stepping backward into invisibility. The Pleiades gather their shimmering grains from the sea of night and tuck them into an invisible pocket. I realize that even the universe here dreams in reverse, inhaling starlight so that darkness can learn to glow.

Finally, I wish to leave—or was it that I have already left? A door appears behind me, swinging shut first, then cracking open wider and wider until its frame dissolves into luminous fog. I step through the memory of my arrival, feet becoming lighter as each reverse heartbeat threads itself back into silence. The world un-stitches around me, folding into the smallest note of music—a single, crystalline tone that slides into my ear, into my mind, until…

…I awaken, forward once more, the echo of that backward universe lingering like frost on a window: proof that somewhere, far beyond the chronology we cling to, cause is gently catching up with effect, and tomorrow is waiting to be untold.
