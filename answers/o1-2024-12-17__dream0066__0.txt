I am dreaming. …suddenly notice the mirrored walls begin to ripple, as though they’re made of liquid silver themselves. Your heart pounds while water seeps in faster than you’ve ever known water to move. The fluorescent ceiling light above you flickers, casting an eerie glow that shimmers off the rising flood. You press desperate, frantic fingers against the elevator’s smooth metal doors, but they refuse to give. They’re cold and slick with water, as if the steel is turning into ice.

Your breath comes in shallow gasps now. The water is already at your waist, swirling with impossible currents, and your clothes cling like weights to your body. You feel a strange numbness creeping across your legs. Still, you can’t help but notice shapes dancing on the inside of the elevator walls: faint outlines of drifting jellyfish and dark silhouettes of fish-like figures. A wave of panic blossoms in your throat. Part of you wonders if you’re hallucinating—or if this claustrophobic shoebox has somehow connected to an otherworldly ocean.

Time slows. You hear a mechanical groan from overhead as the lights blink out entirely. A cavernous darkness envelops you. You can sense the water rising, now brushing against your chin, lapping at your lips. Your broken breathing thunders in your ears. Each inhale is a gulp of cold, damp air. Desperate, you pound the button panel, trying in vain to salvage the final moments of clarity. Nothing responds. Water sloshes and slaps. A quiet terror snakes through your mind: an unshakable certainty that you're completely trapped.

Then, lightning erupts inside the flooded box. It's not actual lightning, but a bright blue glow expands in chaotic, writhing patterns across the water’s surface. It flickers for an instant—then becomes a living, crackling arc, coiling around your arms and sparkles dancing at your fingertips. Your skin tingles with something electric, yet it doesn't harm you. Instead, the shimmering light pulses and softens, revealing itself to be some strange bioluminescent aura. It brightens your surroundings, painting the cramped, metal walls in shades of neon turquoise. 

A sudden surge pushes you off your feet, and water flows into your mouth as it surges to your eyes. You cough and sputter, your vision swimming in fractal patterns. Rather than feel suffocated, though, for a moment you’re overcome with an extraordinary calm. You can hear your heart’s churning echo inside your chest, and you sense your body begin to drift. Is this the moment you give in?

But a warmth blooms near your heart, radiating outward toward your fingertips. You feel your lungs expand, drawing in a breath of water that inexplicably doesn't sting or choke. It feels… breathable, an otherworldly mixture of fluid and oxygen. Bubbles dance up around your face, glimmering strangely in the sapphire glow. The water isn't freezing now; instead, it's soothing, like a comforting bath. The once-silent fish silhouettes reappear, swimming out of the walls, drifting closer. Their glowing eyes fix on you, ghostly watchers of the performance. 

Suddenly, the elevator doors groan again and slide open with a monumental clang. The water rushes out in a torrent, carrying you through a corridor that stretches into a swirling oceanic realm. You’re swept along in a current beneath a fever-dream sky of shifting coral pinks and stormy indigos. Above, shimmering jellyfish with spidery tendrils undulate gently in luminous arcs. Below, you see impossible structures growing from the sea floor—twisting spires of pearl and seashell, ancient sculptures carved by unknown hands. 

Within this fantastical underwater kingdom, you realize you’re neither drowning nor fearful anymore. Hospitality thrums in the water around you. You allow yourself a moment to float there, suspended between panic and euphoria, the strangeness of it all etched into your senses. Bubbles drift from your nose and lips with every steadied exhale, as if the ocean is melding with your lungs, letting you breathe the dream. 

An immense shadow glides overhead, causing the water to surge with fresh waves that ripple like living, moonlit curtains. It could be a whale, or perhaps an entire leviathan of swirling starlight. You feel its presence in your very bones: an ancient guardian patrolling the boundary between nightmares and wonder. Its wail reverberates through you, equal parts lament and lullaby, marking you as a humble traveler in this otherworldly domain.

Yet somehow, your mind whispers of waking, that elusive border where real life intersects with the last flickers of dream. You battle against that boundary. You try to cling to the elevator cage behind you—hoping against hope that this ephemeral, rippling realm might stay just a moment longer. But the gentle hush of the ocean starts to fade.

Everything becomes nebulous, the swirling colors sifting to gray. The final impression you register is the soft glow of that bioluminescent aura, brightening once more as if to bid you farewell… 

And you wake with a gasp, the memory of water still pressing against your skin, the distant echo of submerged wonders echoing in your ears. Only the firm mattress beneath you and the salt on your lips remain, the bittersweet recollection of a dream as wild as an uncharted sea.
