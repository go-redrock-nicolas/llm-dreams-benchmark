I am dreaming. You are in a vast operating theater that seems woven from moonlight and shadows: shimmering silver arches tower overhead, translucent walls flicker with swirling constellations, and there is a whisper in the air like a hush before a grand performance. You stand at the center, dressed not in the typical scrubs but in an otherworldly garment of rippling color—royal blues and molten golds that shift and flow as if alive with your every movement.

Laid out before you on a circular platform is the patient: their face is half-hidden behind curling wisps of fog, yet you feel a keen awareness of their fragility. The faint glow of an unearthly lamp bathes the scene in a pale radiance. All around, the instruments float in the space, as though this dream grants them weightlessness, each polished piece reflecting an impossible swirl of cosmic lights.

The scalpel in your hand is warm, almost alive to the touch. In the distance, you faintly hear the rhythmic patter of your own racing heartbeat echo from somewhere deep within the steel walls. It’s as if the operating theater itself breathes in unison with you, trembling with both anticipation and fear. You know you have no formal training—no real-world knowledge of incisions or scalpels or surgical sutures—yet there’s a thrilling pulse of determination. The patient’s life depends on what you do next.

A wave of dizziness washes over you as you glance down at your trembling hands. You notice the scalpel’s blade glint with an iridescent shine, catching each star-like spark passing through the air. The patient’s eyes flutter open for the briefest moment, revealing twin galaxies within their gaze. The dream’s hush intensifies. Every molecule in the room waits on your next move.

Your breath slows, and you remember fleeting fragments of improbable dream lessons—a chorus of voices from distant corners of your subconscious, urging you to trust in your hidden capabilities. You close your eyes. In that blink of darkness, you see diagrams dancing behind your lids: glowing lines and fractal geometry that reveal themselves as the intricate map of the human brain.

When you open your eyes again, a trembling sense of calm radiates through you. You lower the scalpel with trembling carefulness. At first contact, the edge of the blade hums, resonating with fluorescent patterns that trace along the patient’s skull. Oddly, no blood spills; instead, trails of stardust swirl and coil into the air, as if the patient holds the galaxy beneath their scalp. Each thread of glowing cosmic filament you navigate feels impossibly delicate, resonating with your own heartbeat.

Time slips into a lazy spiral, and you realize that in this dream realm, your fear has transformed into a potent clarity. The surgical instruments respond to your mind’s unspoken commands; they float when you need them to, become gentler or sharper in harmonious lockstep with your intuition. You begin to perform the delicate procedure as though guided by unseen mentors, moving through shimmering cerebral pathways that radiate in colors the human eye has never seen.

Sweat beads on your forehead; it drips into the swirling stardust and vaporizes in little pops of shining mist. The quiet of the theater amplifies every sound—your own breathing, the subtle hiss of your internal panic cowering in the corners of your thoughts. And yet, despite the extraordinary weight upon your shoulders, you feel an indescribable rush of hope. Each passing moment, each deliberate motion of your hand, drives you closer to saving the patient.

Then comes the final suturing: you feel a wave of ecstasy, a sense of completing a wondrous puzzle. The cosmic threads stitch themselves under the guidance of your scalpel’s humming blade, closing seamlessly as if made of living light. The floating instruments drift away, satisfied, returning to a quiet orbit in the air. And as you withdraw your hands, you realize the patient’s breathing has grown steady and calm.

Warm relief floods through you, soaking your heart in incandescent gratitude. The luminous world of the operating theater seems to soften at the edges, and a swirling darkness—gentle, comforting—begins to gather at the corners of your vision. You sense the dream slipping from your grasp. But as it does, you glimpse the patient’s eyes flutter, a faint smile offered in silent thanks.

And then you exhale—and wake, the feeling of the scalpel’s comforting weight still echoing in your hand, the glow of stardust lingering behind your closed lids.
