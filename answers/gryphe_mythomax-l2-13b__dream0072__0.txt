I am dreaming. The scene unfolds in a bustling office full of people hunched over their computers, typing away furiously. Amidst the hustle and bustle, two colleagues who were previously friendly exchange heated words. Their voices rise as they argue passionately about an important project that they are working on together. 

As a bystander to this debate, you can't help but feel intrigued and worried. The tension between them is thick, and it's clear that their disagreement could lead to disastrous consequences for the project. You crane your neck to get a better view of the situation. 

Suddenly, one of them storms off, slamming their laptop shut, leaving the other one stunned and alone. The remaining colleague looks around anxiously, helplessly pleading with everyone for their opinion on who's right in this debate. All eyes turn towards you, hoping that you might have the answer to end this impasse. 

You take a deep breath, gather your thoughts, and finally, muster the courage to speak up. With a strong, clear voice, you express your honest opinion about the merits and flaws of both sides of the argument. Your colleagues listen intently, hanging onto your every word. 

When you finish speaking, there's a palpable sense of relief in the room. Some nod their heads in agreement, while others offer their own insights. The tension seems to ebb away as everyone focuses on finding a common ground and resolving the issue. 

As the room slowly quiets down, you glance around, feeling a sense of pride wash over you. You realize that your contribution helped to diffuse a potentially explosive situation, and you feel a sense of camaraderie with your colleagues. 

With a sigh of contentment, you wake up from the dream, feeling refreshed and invigorated for the day ahead.
