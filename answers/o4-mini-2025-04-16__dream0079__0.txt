I am dreaming. You are dreaming. Before you stretches a vast, undulating landscape of violet dunes pierced by spiraling towers of glass. The sky pulses in ribbons of emerald and rose, and a distant thunder of chanting winds gives rhythm to your racing heart. At the summit of the tallest tower lies your impossible task: to unlock a door carved from liquid starlight, behind which waits the answer you’ve long sought—but every step up that tower crackles with fear.

With your hands trembling, you call out to your community for guidance and assistance, and they answer in a symphony of light. First comes your grandmother’s gentle laughter, shaped like silver smoke, weaving through the air to cradle you. Then your neighbor’s strong voice, rich and resonant, rolls in like warm honey. Friends you’ve never met arrive as flickering silhouettes—artists, gardeners, teachers—each humming a unique note that merges into a chorus of encouragement. As they gather at your side, your world brightens, the dunes shifting into patterns that pulse under your feet, lighting the way upward.

They bring you three gifts:  
  • A compass fashioned from your earliest memories, its needle pointing constantly toward hope.  
  • A cloak stitched from threads of compassion, warm enough to shield you from self-doubt.  
  • A chalice carved of morning dew that, when you sip, restores the courage you feared had been lost.  

Together, you ascend the spiral stairs of the glass tower. At first each footfall threatens to shatter, but with every step their song grows louder—an echo of shared laughter, shared burdens, shared triumphs—and the stairs solidify beneath you. At midway, a roar of wind tries to push you back, yet your companions form an arch of light, standing resolute. Their voices weave through the gusts, so the wind becomes a partner in your ascent rather than an enemy.

At last you stand before the doorway of liquid starlight. Etched upon it are your doubts—impossible equations, whispered “what ifs,” the shape of every fear you carry. Your community falls silent. You lift the chalice to your lips and drink. A gentle warmth spreads through your chest, and your grandmother’s laughter returns, infusing your bones with calm. You open your eyes, meet your own steady gaze reflected in the starlit door, and intone a single word of truth: I am enough.

The door dissolves in a cascade of sparkling light. Beyond lies a meadow of endless possibility, where the grass glows softly beneath a sky free of storm. Your companions’ voices rise one last time in a joyful song of victory—yours and theirs entwined. And in that moment you realize the challenge was never truly yours alone. It was a journey you undertook together, and you awaken buoyed by the unbreakable bond of community, ready to carry its warmth into every waking hour.
