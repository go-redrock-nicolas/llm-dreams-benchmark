I am dreaming. I am drifting through a rose-fogged sky, my arms outstretched like wings too fragile to carry me. Below, the world ripples in pastel currents—lavender rivers winding past towering alabaster trees whose leaves tremble like silent bells. A faint melody hums in the breeze, a lullaby I once shared with someone now long gone. As I float, that melody warps, twisting into a half-remembered argument: the sting of old words I never quite let go of.  

Suddenly, the horizon shudders and a doorway of moonlight swings open. On the threshold stands a figure with my old partner’s familiar silhouette. Their eyes burn with accusation, though their face is smeared in shifting pigments of blue and violet. My heart hammers: here it is again, the echo of past hurts invading a moment that has nothing to do with them. I taste bitterness on my tongue, an unconscious replay of old grievances.  

In that instant, the air cracks, and I see it—the silver filaments tying my chest to the figure before me, glowing threads of memory and fear. I realize I am projecting: overlaying yesterday’s quarrels onto today’s calm. Around us, the trees dissolve, replaced by a smooth obsidian hall lined with countless mirrors. Each reflection shows a different version of me, some wounded, some unrecognizable.  

I step forward, heart thundering, and place my trembling hand on my own mirrored face. “This isn’t you,” I whisper, and the glass trembles. The old figure flickers, its features draining away like ink in water. I breathe deep, feeling the silver threads snap one by one as I name what is real: the hushed present moment, my safe surroundings, the kindness of someone who isn’t here. My mind unclenches, and the hall of mirrors crumbles into stardust.  

Suddenly I’m back in the sky, but the rose fog has lifted. Now I drift above a field of luminous lilies, each bloom opening like a radiant eye. There is no accusation in their gaze, only gentle curiosity. I stretch my wings again, but this time they feel whole, unburdened by old shadows. As I descend toward the glowing flowers, I carry with me the simple truth I reclaimed in the obsidian hall: not every heartbeat echoes a wound, not every face reminds me of loss. And in that knowing, I wake—lighter, freer, ready to meet the day without the ghosts of the past clinging to my wings.
