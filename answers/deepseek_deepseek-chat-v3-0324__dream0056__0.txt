I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Untamed Wilds**  

You blink, and suddenly the world around you shifts. The air is thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. A cool mist curls around your ankles, swirling like a living thing. Ahead, a dense forest looms, towering trees stretching into a twilight sky streaked with violet and gold. You are not alone.  

Behind you, a group of strangers—faces unfamiliar yet oddly trusted—clutch maps, ropes, and worn leather packs. Their eyes turn to you, expectant. A woman with a long braid and a scar across her cheek nods. "Lead on," she murmurs.  

But you’ve never done this before. Your hands, though steady, hold no calluses from rope burns, no ingrained dirt from weeks of travel. Yet something deeper whispers: *You know the way.*  

The first challenge comes swiftly—a ravine, splitting the earth as if cut by a god’s blade. A rickety rope bridge sways ominously in the wind. One wrong step, and the abyss yawns below. You press your palm against the frayed fibers, and somehow, impossibly, you *feel* its weakness. "Not this one," you say. "We’ll find another path."  

The group follows without question.  

Deeper into the forest, the trees seem to lean closer, murmuring in a language just beyond understanding. A faint glow pulses between their roots—bioluminescent fungi, lighting the way like buried stars. Animals watch from the shadows: a fox with silver-tipped fur, an owl with too many eyes.  

Then, the ground trembles. The forest *breathes.*  

A massive shape moves in the undergrowth—something ancient, something waking. Fear prickles your spine, but instead of fleeing, you raise your hand. A hum resonates in your chest, a sound that doesn’t belong to this world. The creature stills. Eyes like molten gold meet yours, and for a heartbeat, you *understand* it.  

The strangers exhale in awe.  

Night falls, and the stars above *shift*, forming unfamiliar constellations that tell stories you’ve never heard but somehow know by heart. You guide your companions to a clearing where the earth is warm, where embers from an old fire still glow—though no one remembers lighting it.  

As dawn paints the sky in blood and honey, you realize: this land has been waiting for you. Not the experienced guide you aren't, but the one you *become* in the space between breaths.  

And when you wake, the scent of pine lingers—just for a moment—before fading into the waking world.
