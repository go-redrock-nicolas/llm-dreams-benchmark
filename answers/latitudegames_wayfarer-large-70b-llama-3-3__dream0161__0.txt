I am dreaming. As the raging blizzard intensifies, howling winds whip ice crystals against my skin like a thousand tiny blades. The mountain path beneath my feet grows narrower by the second, disappearing beneath an ever-deepening blanket of snow. My toes have gone completely numb, and the bitter cold seeps into my bones with aching persistence. I struggle forward, using my ice axe for balance as the gusts threaten to sweep me off my feet and send me plummeting into the abyss below.
