I am dreaming. The worn cobblestones beneath my feet shimmer like liquid gold in the fading twilight, pulsing with the rhythm of my quiet breath. The news had arrived on the wings of an obsidian raven, its message etched upon my palm in silver ink that dissolved against my skin—leaving only the weight of its meaning behind. 

A storm of emotions should rise in me. A hurricane. A flood. But instead, the air around me grows thick with the scent of jasmine and warm earth. The cobblestones shift, unspooling into a narrow path through a twilight garden, where the trees whisper in languages lost to time. 

I step forward. 

With each stride, the grief transforms—not gone, but alchemized. The sorrow twists into vines, curling around my arms, blossoming into midnight flowers that hum against my skin. The pain shimmers, becomes fireflies caught in glass lanterns, casting fractured light across my path. 

The garden breathes with me. 

And then—colors deepen. Purples so rich they taste like grapes. Blues that ripple like the ocean’s underbelly. The path leads me to a still black pool, its surface mirror-smooth. Reflected back at me is not my own face, but a thousand shifting possibilities—each one another version of what comes next. 

I kneel. Dip my fingers. The pool remains undisturbed, but I feel it… the ripple courses through my veins, cool and certain. 

"Once, you dreamed yourself small," murmurs the wind. "Now, dream yourself vast." 

I close my eyes—and breathe again. 

The night garden dissolves into stars, and the stars dissolve into song.
