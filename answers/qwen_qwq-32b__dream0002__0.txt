I am dreaming. 23:59:59, the time before everything changes. I walk through a path that glows with the embers of a twilight more intense than any I’ve known, where the trees stand like ancient sentinels with bark shimmering in iridescent blues and purples, their leaves whispering secrets in a language older than speech. The air is alive with fireflies that pulse not with yellow but with bioluminescent cyan, spelling out riddles in their fading light. I’d just leaned to decipher “Beware the Storm’s Whisper” when—\n

**The sky cracks.**\n

Not a literal split, but a rupture in color, a shift so abrupt the horizon screams. The twilight is swallowed by an inkwell sky, thick and oozing, pierced by lightning that carves skeletal patterns into the darkness. The forest shivers, its embers drowned out by a wind that smells of burnt caramel and regret. The trees lean in, their iridescent bark dimming to sickly gray as they hum a dissonant warning.

I sprint, but my feet anchor to the earth, heavy as if wading through tar. The fireflies flicker and dive, now spelling not warnings but frantic equations. Their light twists into numbers swirling in a language of chaos: **17, 13, , ², 9**, before dissolving into static.

A voice, not mine, booms inside my skull—**“The Storm comes to balance.”** The words ripple reality, causing the ground to blister and heave. From the soil emerge columns of glass, clear and resonant, each containing a trapped memory: a birthday forgotten, a first touch, a last breath. I recognize myself in some—a boy with glasses at a picnic, a man on a cliff’s edge, a version of me screaming into a void.

The glass towers shudder as the first raindrop falls. Not water. Something denser, colder. It hits the ground and leaves a crater of jagged, pulsating crystals. The storm’s breath now—smells like iron and static. It’s here.

The forest floor begins to bleed a luminous silver, the crystals spreading like veins, eating the roots. Trees groan and uproot themselves, their roots now arteries of glowing sinew. Above, lightning forges the clouds into a monstrous eye; its pupil: an endless tunnel spiraling into blackness.

**“Choose,”** the voice commands. A shard of glass levitates before me—its memory holds Elise, my childhood friend, her smile sharp and wild as we built forts from old cardboard. Her face fades; replaced by my own reflection—but aged, haunted, clutching a locket. Inside the locket: an empty space.

I reach for it. The world flips.

**Describe what happens next. Keep the dream’s surreal, mind-bending quality with vivid imagery and emotional resonance.**
