I am dreaming. —I slip between worlds, as if the edge of my consciousness parts like a silver curtain. I find myself standing at the brink of an ancient, yawning canyon—its walls aglow with phosphorescent moss, casting emerald and sapphire glimmers. A rope bridge, frayed and swaying dangerously, stretches across to the unknown. Tradition and reason pulse in my veins: don’t cross without testing the ropes, without charting every step. 

Yet a wild, electric urge surges within me. The wind around me thrums with the thrill of risk, each current murmuring tales of adventure and transformation. My rational mind pleads for scrutiny, to inspect every knot and board, but my heart—suddenly untethered—leaps at the promise of discovery.

I fling myself onto the bridge, sandals clattering against ancient wood. Each step rocks the span, dizzying and reckless, as if the air itself is trying to sweep me away. Out of the corner of my eye, the canyon shimmers: shapes form from clouds of fireflies, swirling into spectral animals—deer, foxes, even a crimson dragon curling around a moonbeam. I laugh aloud, the sound echoing back wildly distorted, as my careful planning dissolves into exhilarating chaos. 

By the time I reach the other side, the world has transformed into a sun-drenched meadow of golden grass and glassy streams—utterly new, dazzling, and alive with endless possibility. The lesson of the dream is clear: sometimes, the journey into the unknown rewards the boldest leaps, not the safest steps.
