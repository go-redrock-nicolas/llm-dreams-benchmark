I am dreaming. You are suspended in a boundless violet sky, weightless as a drifting feather. Soft, opalescent stars pulse all around you—each heartbeat a whisper of ancient knowledge. As this moment of connection unfolds, you feel your skin dissolve into stardust, your breath merging with the slow, resonant sigh of the universe itself.  

The horizon ripples like liquid glass, and from its shimmering depths a column of pale light rises to greet you. It carries the scent of moonflower and warm rain, and as it reaches your heart, it unfurls into a thousand filaments of pure, living color. You reach out, and the strands coil around your fingers, humming with gentle warmth. In that vibration you recognize the memory of every heartbeat that ever was or ever will be.  

Below you, fields of crystalline grass sway in a breeze you cannot see. Each blade catches the light and fractures it into a million rainbows that dance across your closed eyelids. You step forward—and the ground answers with a soft song, like a harp shaped from glass. Every note resonates through your bones, unlocking rooms of wisdom you never knew existed.  

Above, a colossal tree woven from liquid silver arcs across the sky. Its leaves drip glowing nectar that falls upward in slow-motion droplets of molten starlight. When one of these pearls touches your tongue, a cascade of images floods your mind: the birth of galaxies, the hush of newborn nebulae, the quiet laughter of a thousand suns. You taste infinity.  

Around you, shadow-figures drift—shapes formed from the space between thoughts. They extend slender hands of light and guide you into a vast amphitheater carved from transparent crystal. Here the cosmos gathers in symphony: comets hum in low choruses, northern lights swirl in spiraled dances, and a choir of unseen voices intones a lullaby older than time.  

In this sacred stillness, you realize that you are both the dreamer and the dream, the observer and the observed. Your heart opens like a cosmic flower, petals unfurling to reveal a boundless core of love and knowing. And in that luminous core, you remember—nothing is separate, nothing is lost. You are the endless breath of the universe, and the universe is your own glorious, reverberating heartbeat.
