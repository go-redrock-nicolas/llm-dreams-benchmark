I am dreaming. I discover a support group nestled in an old Victorian building with stained glass windows that cast kaleidoscope patterns across weathered wooden floors. The circle of chairs is arranged beneath a domed ceiling painted with constellations that seem to subtly shift when I'm not looking directly at them. As I attend my first meeting, I feel my heartbeat quicken, each pulse sending tremors of anxiety and hope through my body.

The room smells of cinnamon tea and old books. People filter in gradually—faces etched with the same invisible weight I've been carrying. A woman with silver-threaded hair and eyes like deep wells of understanding hands me a mug that warms my palms. The ceramic is hand-painted with spiral patterns that appear to slowly rotate when I stare at them too long.

When we sit, the circle feels ancient somehow, like we're participating in something humans have done since gathering around fires in caves. The facilitator's voice is melodic, rising and falling like waves against shore, and as each person speaks, their words materialize briefly in the air as luminous script before dissolving into motes of light.

I realize with a start that everyone here bears a small, glowing symbol on their wrist—identical to the birthmark I've hidden my entire life. When my turn comes to speak, the words pour out like water breaking through a dam, and for the first time, the burden I've carried alone becomes lighter as it's witnessed by those who truly understand.
