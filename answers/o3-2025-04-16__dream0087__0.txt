I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You find yourself standing in a vaulted chamber that feels half–courtroom, half–cathedral, cobbled together from memories your waking mind has never owned. The ceiling roils like an upside-down ocean of stained-glass waves, each pane depicting an episode of the family’s long, tangled history. The floor is polished obsidian streaked with silver veins that pulse faintly, as though the stone remembers every footstep it has ever borne.

At an enormous round table sit the disputing relatives—two factions of the same bloodline who once shared lullabies and now swap accusations as sharp as broken porcelain. To your left, the branch descended from the elder sibling: their clothes are brocaded in dusk colors, indigo and claret, eyes full of ancient entitlement. To your right, the branch of the younger: they wear lighter shades—sage, pearl—and cling to a wounded sense of having been overlooked for generations. Between them, the table’s ebony surface reflects their scowls so perfectly that the very reflections appear to quarrel.

At first, voices are civil, though each syllable clinks like glass. They discuss property lines, inheritance, a vanished heirloom locket. But old resentments leak through every pause, rising like vapor. When the conversation tips toward rage, the stained-glass ceiling responds: panes flash crimson, then crack, threads of light spidering outward. Ancestral faces painted in those panes grimace and whisper, urging the living to fresh fury.

You breathe in, tasting iron on the air. A tremor ripples through the obsidian floor; silver veins splinter into thorn-shaped tendrils that spread beneath their chairs, ready to bloom into danger. Words now slam against the chamber’s marble columns—literal words, flaring letters of molten gold that strike the stone with the clang of church bells. One faction’s patriarch shouts, “You stole our birthright!” Another matriarch fires back, “You squandered it first!” Flames of rhetoric whip above their heads, forming dueling sigils in the smoky air.

Time to act.

You lift your hands. From your palms unfurl ribbons of soft luminescence—honey-colored, warm as hearthlight—curling outward until they bind the edges of the round table, knitting together like living silk. The obsidian calms under this glow; the silver roots recede, the floor humming contentedly, soothed but not yet safe.

When the factions look at you, their faces momentarily share the same amazement, as if startled to remember you were there at all. You speak, but your words are not ordinary language. Each sentence forms a translucent seed that drifts above the table before opening into a miniature memory: two cousins sharing a secret fort; a grandmother laughing, flour on her cheeks; brothers weaving willow whistles by a river that no longer exists. The quarrelers see themselves inside these floating silhouettes, feel the warmth of forgotten afternoons. Some scowl at first, arms crossed, but even their anger flickers like a candle in a draft.

Yet beneath the surface, hostility remains. The chamber darkens again; the broken stained-glass shards tremble overhead. You need something deeper.

Firmly, you reach toward the table’s center. From the obsidian’s heart, you summon the Family Tree—not a genealogical chart but a literal sapling of silver bark and emerald leaves. It pushes upward, thickening into a small, radiant tree whose roots thread through every crack in the floor, drinking up generations of grievances. The moment it appears, the room fills with the scent of rain on dry earth. Leaves whisper in too many voices at once—babies’ coos, lovers’ promises, soldiers’ farewells—all the notes of the family’s long orchestra.

You invite each faction to step forward and place a hand upon the bark. Reluctantly, they rise. Their fingertips touch the trunk, and the tree glows brighter, splaying constellations of living light across the ceiling. In that glow, the stained-glass shards knit themselves into new murals—no longer scenes of betrayal but of births, harvest dances, and reunion dinners. The ceiling becomes a tapestry of possibility rather than pain.

A hush falls. The patriarch’s shoulders slump, as though he’s set down a boulder he’s carried since youth. The matriarch’s eyes glitter, and it isn’t only anger—there’s saltwater there too, unspilled tears for sisters lost to time. One cousin begins to hum a lullaby no one has sung in decades; another picks up the melody. Soon, the chamber rings with a song that bridges both factions, older than any feud.

When the last note hovers in the air like a firefly hesitant to land, you speak again—this time in plain words. “Let history be your compass, not your cage.” Your voice echoes once, twice, then settles into the floor’s silver veins. The obsidian shines mirror-still; no cracks remain.

The factions return to their seats, but the chairs have subtly shifted, nudged closer so knees almost touch. They look at one another not as rivals but as weary travelers who have shared a storm. Agreements are not yet drafted, apologies not yet said—but a door has opened, and through it drifts a dawn-colored breeze.

A bell you cannot see tolls overhead. The murals brighten, then recede into a gentler twilight. You feel the dream’s gravity release you, the chamber dissolving into petals of light that swirl away like dandelion seeds. The silver tree is the last to vanish, its leaves curling into sparks that spell the single word Remember before they wink out.

And you awaken, heart thrumming, palms warm, the scent of rain still ghosting the air, as though the dream’s roots have followed you into morning.
