I am dreaming. You wake in a shadowed corridor, the air thick with the sour tang of burning plastic and something colder—like fear distilled into pure scent. Overhead, a single fluorescent tube sputters, casting the walls into jagged bands of yellow and inky black. Your heart hammers as you realize you’re alone in a vast, labyrinthine building—and every second brings fresh peril.

You step forward onto a floor that shudders beneath your weight. The tiles ripple like water, then crack, sending splinters of ceramic skittering away. From somewhere deeper in the maze comes the low roar of steam escaping a ruptured pipe. A hiss coalesces into a scalding cloud that billows down the hall, spitting fireflies of molten metal against the walls.

Your mind races as you press a hand to the wall’s cold cement, searching for an exit. Ahead, the corridor splits into three paths:

  1. Left: A jagged staircase spirals downward. Somewhere below you hear the plash of water and an echoing drip—ominous as a time bomb.  
  2. Straight: A pair of double doors, their windows smeared in something dark. Every few seconds, a faint green glow pulses behind them.  
  3. Right: A narrow maintenance tunnel, lit by ghostly emergency lights that flicker on and off, revealing walls slick with an oily residue.  

Your lungs burn for fresh air; you choose the right-hand tunnel and squeeze through. The oily walls drip onto your boots. A distant rumble shakes the building as if it resents your presence. Overhead the lights wink out entirely, plunging you into pitch. You navigate by touch, groping for a handrail that isn’t there, until your fingers brush cold metal. You follow it, inching along, until you emerge into a shattered atrium.

Moonlight glints off broken glass strewn across a terrazzo floor. In the center, a skylight yawns open to an overgrown rooftop garden. Beyond its vines and rusted benches you can almost taste freedom. But between you and the sky stands a waist-high wall, crimson-stained and prickly with rusted spikes. At its base coils something long and dark—a rat snake, its scales shimmering iridescent in the moon’s glow. It hums, low and electric, as it sensors your approach.

Your pulse ricochets in your ears. You weigh your options: try to leap the wall, risk the spikes—or distract the snake first. You scan the atrium and notice shards of glass arranged in a rough arc, catching stray moonbeams like faceted eyes. Thinking fast, you hurl a chunk across the floor. It clinks, rolls—and the serpent uncoils, slithering toward the sound.

You vault up, pain slicing through your palms as you catch a spiked rim. You swing a leg over and clear the barrier, landing in the garden’s strange hush. A cool breeze brushes your sweating face; you can hear distant sirens, or perhaps your own pulse.

But the dream isn’t done testing you. Behind you the atrium begins to flood, each shattered panel leaking a viscous, pale liquid that hisses on contact with glass. You dash for a crumbling stairwell at the garden’s edge, vines tearing at your clothes. Above you, the final exit—a heavy steel door—hangs loosely on its hinges, monsters of shadow clawing at it.

With a rally of adrenaline, you shoulder it open and stumble into the night. Crisp air floods in, stars glint like distant, knowing eyes—and your chest unfurls as you realize you’ve escaped… until you blink, and find yourself once again at the foot of that first staircase, the corridor’s fluorescent tube sputtering, beckoning you to choose your path anew.
