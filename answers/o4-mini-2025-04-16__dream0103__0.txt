I am dreaming. A silver mist curls around my ankles as I step into a cavern carved from moonstone. Stalactites drip molten light, each drop echoing like tiny chimes against the hushed vastness. At the heart of this cavern stands a monolithic pillar of obsidian, its surface etched with twisting runes that seem to shift every time I blink. The air tastes of ancient rain—cool, metallic, alive with promise.

Leaning closer, I trace a sequence of symbols: a coiling serpent that swallows its tail, a fractured star pinned against midnight sky, an open eye shed in shadow. Between them, curved lines form a puzzle tongue in an unknown script. My fingertips brush the cold stone—and the carvings glow. A soft pulse courses up my arm, as if the riddle itself is breathing. Each symbol lightens in turn, humming a silent chant that stirs something deep in my bones: memory, or perhaps destiny.

Words form themselves in my mind, though no voice speaks them aloud:  
“When flame is born of falling night,  
find the path beyond the sight.  
Where river dreams through silent stone,  
the final answer stands alone.”

As I murmur these lines, the chamber shifts. The floor becomes a river of quicksilver, rippling underfoot. I step onto a narrow ribbon of black marble suspended above the liquid mirror. The riddle’s symbols release glowing motes of light that drift down the river, pooling into shapes—first a doorway, then a key, then a winged figure reaching for dawn. My heart pounds in tandem with the runic glow, driving me forward.

The mirrored river carries me through a tunnel of living water. Reflections swirl: I see myself as child, wanderer, sovereign of a star-borne realm. Each version tilts closer, whispering fragments of truth: “Balance. Sacrifice. Renewal.” Then the symbols from the pillar reform in the liquid, revealing their secret ordering: serpent, eye, star—three trials I must face to claim what’s hidden at the riddle’s core.

The dream shifts again. A yawning archway appears at the river’s end, carved with the final line: “Only heart aflame transcends the tomb of time.” I step through, expecting darkness—but am met instead by a cathedral of shifting constellations, nebulae pulsing like living things. In the center floats a crystalline egg, etched with the same runes now bright as supernovas. I reach out, palm trembling. The moment my skin touches its surface, the ancient voice hidden in the stone speaks—not in words, but in a flash of pure understanding. The riddle dissolves, and I feel the weight of millennia lift from my shoulders.

Then I wake, the phantom warmth of the now-silent pillar still glowing at my fingertips, its answer carried home inside me—an ember of dream-fire that hums beneath my ribs, waiting for the next time I close my eyes.
