I am dreaming.

I awaken—not in my bed, but in a ballroom of shifting colors, where every surface glimmers and sighs with a life of its own. Around me, people waltz between pillars woven from moonlight and shadow, their faces shifting like reflections on water. I move to join them, and each tilt of my head, each exhaled breath, leaves ripples in the air—gentle as silk, but unmistakable.  

As I step forward, I notice how a smile unbidden makes the woman in blue flicker with sudden brightness; how the wrinkle of my brow dims the lanterns in the corner. My hands, fluttering with uncertainty, send currents through the room—tiny gusts that set dancers spinning or stumbling. Laughter, surprise, even sorrow pulse around me, shaped by these gestures I once thought invisible.

With this new awareness, I become deliberate. My movements slow, measured. When I bow, graceful and open-hearted, a chord of warmth threads through the crowd, drawing other dreamers near. If I hesitate, shrinking inward, the colors in the ballroom pale and the melody softens to a whisper.

The dream deepens. I realize that my body is an instrument playing in a vast, unseen orchestra, each gesture a note in the symphony of this strange world. A raised eyebrow emboldens a shy stranger; a sidelong glance causes ripples of uncertainty far beyond what I intended. My posture weaves connection or distance. How powerful—and how fragile—this language is.

With this knowledge, I move through the ballroom with intention, infusing my every nod and gesture with encouragement, kindness, and invitation. The room responds, growing wilder and more radiant. The guests—figments, perhaps, of my own psyche—blossom in confidence, their laughter spilling like champagne, their eyes shining with the reflected light of my softened gaze.

And as the dream begins to fade, I carry with me a lingering awareness: the shape of my presence leaves echoes in every space I inhabit, woven silently, irreversibly, into the dreams and realities of those around me.
