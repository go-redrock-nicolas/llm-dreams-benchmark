I am dreaming. You open your eyes inside the dream and discover you are already moving—waist-deep in grass the color of moonlight. Each blade glows as if stitched with threads of silver, swaying in a breeze that smells faintly of paper and saltwater. Far above, two moons hang like watchful coins: one jade-green and one bronze, each pulsing to the slow rhythm of an unseen heartbeat—perhaps your own, perhaps the world’s.

Ahead rises a weather-beaten gate made of cracked mirrors. Beyond it you glimpse two diverging paths, though the mirrors warp them like melted glass:

Path of Feather and Path of Anchor.  
Freedom or Memory.  
Flight or Home.

An ink-black heron perches atop the gatepost, feathers dripping galaxies. It tilts its head, speaking without sound: “Choose.”

You step closer and the dilemma unfolds with aching clarity.

1. The Path of Feather
   A bridge of floating parchment pages stretches out over an endless gulf. On the far side, a crystalline aviary holds a single phoenix whose plumage flickers through every color you have ever loved and every color you have yet to name. If you cross and unlock the cage, the phoenix will be free—and so will you. Gravity will loosen its grip; you will shed the weight of expectations, drift among constellations, and write your life in fire across the sky.   But the price is heavy. To take the path of Feather is to forfeit every memory of the faces that taught you kindness, the songs that steadied your courage, the very scent of rain from the town where you were born. You will soar unburdened, yet stripped of the stories that make flight meaningful.

2. The Path of Anchor
   This road spirals downward through cathedral-like roots of an world-spanning tree. Lanterns—each containing moments from your past—hang in the hollows, humming like distant lullabies. At journey’s end waits a marble dais holding an antique compass. Place your palm upon it and every memory, every friendship, every bittersweet chapter will be woven into an unbreakable tapestry. You will keep them all, safeguarded forever.   But in sealing the memories you must bind the phoenix’s wings to the earth. Imagination, risk, the wild swing of possibility—these will soften, dim, and eventually quiet. Your life will remain rich with the known, yet the sky will forever be closed.

The heron’s eyes are twin eclipses. “There is no third gate,” it warns.

Wind gusts; parchment pages lift and rattle like applause. Far below, roots creak like ancient floorboards. Your heart staggers between them—Feather beating in one chamber, Anchor tugging in the other.

A subtle sound rises—your mother laughing at a kitchen table, a friend calling your name across a midnight highway, the crackle of a campfire where you once vowed never to settle. Each memory arrives as a lantern-hued moth, brushing your cheeks, asking to be kept. Simultaneously, the phoenix sings, its voice a sunrise distilled into sound: vast, uncaged, incomprehensibly new.

You close your eyes inside the dream and feel the boundary between heartbeat and universe blur. Then—almost imperceptibly—you step.

Toward the gate you choose, the dream tilts. The moons exhale. Mirrors shatter into a rain of prisms, illuminating your decision but hiding its aftermath. You taste both grief and relief in the same breath, knowing compromise is always a kind of alchemy: something is lost, something is born.

And as the scene dissolves into the hush that precedes waking, one final truth lingers like a comet’s tail across your mind: even in dreams, the hardest choices are not between good and evil but between two pieces of your own soul.
