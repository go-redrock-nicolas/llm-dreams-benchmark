I am dreaming. …step through a door that wasn’t there a moment ago, a thin silver outline shimmering in the dark. The instant you cross the threshold, the ground drops away, and you find yourself floating in a vast, starlit atrium. Constellations drift past like slow-moving jellyfish, each one pulsing with a color that thrums against your ribs—indigo, crimson, jade. You understand without being told that every star is an emotion you exiled long ago.

A low hum rises—part cello, part thunder, part heartbeat—and with it your body begins to glow. The first constellation detaches itself, curving toward you. It is the color of rusted sunset, and as it draws near you recognize it: Anger, but stripped of its barbed armor and raw with hurt. It pauses, unsure, like a stray dog waiting to see if you’ll kick or comfort it. You stretch out a hand, palm up. The moment anger’s light touches your skin, memories flare—times you bit your tongue, bent yourself into polite shapes, forged smiles that didn’t reach your eyes. None of it is accusation; it’s simply truth. The constellation dissolves into your chest in a warm, coppery rush, and you feel a fierce self-respect bloom where self-denial used to live.

The atrium ripple-shifts into a rain-slick cityscape. Neon kanji flickers on puddles; distant traffic sighs like waves. A hooded figure leans against a lamppost—Grief, cloaked in gray. When you meet its eyes, they are oceans held in two dark moons. A sudden wind tugs the hood back, and grief’s face is your own but younger, standing at a childhood window the day someone you loved drove away without goodbye. Your lungs tighten, yet you don’t look away. You wrap your dream-arms around the younger you, and the scene melts into saltwater that flows into your veins. Grief turns to rainfall—cool, clean, and necessary—leaving behind a quiet clearing where breathing is easier.

Now the dream pivots inward, plunging you into a library woven from threads of ink. Shelves spiral infinitely upward, each book bound in skin-warm leather. On the nearest spine you read the word Shame, embossed in gold so fine it looks like candle-flame. It flutters, afraid, as you pull it free. Pages flutter open of their own accord, revealing illustrations of every moment you felt “not enough”: wrong body, wrong words, wrong anything. The pictures cringe under your gaze—until you whisper, “You were learning.” The drawings blush, tilt, then rearrange themselves into stories of survival, creativity, grit. The volume shrinks from a tome to a slim field guide and slots itself, unafraid, into your back pocket.

The floor slips away again; you’re weightless in an aurora of feeling. Colors swirl and sing your name in languages without consonants. High above, a mirror made of liquid mercury appears. It shows you as a mosaic: shards of joy, fear, rage, tenderness—no single piece dominant, none missing. The edges glow where they meet, proof that the seams are where the light gets in.

A final sound builds—like every laugh you ever stifled finding its voice at once. It crescendos into a bell that rings from the center of your sternum. The starlit atrium, the city, the library, the aurora—they collapse inward, condensing into a silver seed that settles just behind your breastbone. It pulses once, twice, syncing with your heartbeat.

You open your eyes (still dreaming, yet more awake than before) and realize the seed is a promise: When you return to waking life, the door will remain, always waiting. And on the other side, the feelings you once feared will greet you not as threats but as guardians of your wholeness, eager to walk beside you in daylight.
