I am dreaming. I'm stuck in an elevator that's rapidly filling with water. As panic sets in and my breathing becomes shallow, I notice something peculiar—the water is warm, almost comforting against my skin, and glows with an ethereal blue luminescence. The elevator buttons begin to transform, melting into tiny swimming fish that dart between my fingers when I reach for them. The ceiling of the elevator gradually dissolves into a night sky filled with stars that ripple like reflections on water.

My initial fear morphs into wonder as I realize I can breathe perfectly well beneath the rising water. My lungs fill with liquid that somehow provides more clarity than air ever did. The elevator walls become transparent, revealing that we're not in a building at all, but descending through layers of an impossible ocean where forgotten cities made of coral and crystal stretch across the seafloor.

Schools of incandescent creatures I've never seen before—part bird, part fish, with wings that leave trails of bubbles—swim circles around the elevator. They seem to be guiding me toward something. In the distance, enormous bell-shaped structures pulse with internal light, sending out harmonic tones that I can feel vibrating through the water and into my bones.

I realize the elevator is no longer moving mechanically but drifting with purpose, like a seed carried on a breeze, toward an ancient doorway carved into the side of an underwater mountain. The door is covered in symbols that rearrange themselves as I watch, somehow spelling out a message that feels deeply personal, though I can't quite translate it.

As the elevator approaches the threshold, the water around me begins to whisper in countless voices, telling stories in languages both familiar and forgotten, and I sense I'm about to discover something I've always known but never remembered.
