I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air around you shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, but it is cool and sweet, tasting of forgotten summers and the first breath of dawn. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all—translucent columns of liquid glass, their branches spiraling upward to cradle constellations that drip starlight like honey. Each leaf is a prism, fracturing light into colors that have no names, hues that hum in your bones. You step forward, and the ground beneath your feet is not solid but a living mosaic of moss and bioluminescent fungi, pulsing in time with a heartbeat that isn’t yours.  

As you walk, the forest whispers. Not words, but memories—not your own, but ones that feel intimately familiar. A child’s laughter echoes from a thousand years ago, a lover’s sigh from a civilization that crumbled to dust, the primal scream of a creature taking its first breath in a primordial sea. You realize you are not alone. Shadows move at the periphery of your vision, figures woven from smoke and starlight, their forms shifting like reflections in a broken mirror. They do not speak, but you feel their presence as a warmth in your chest, a silent chorus harmonizing with your thoughts.  

Then the forest dissolves. You are standing on a cliff that overlooks an ocean of liquid mercury, its surface rippling with the imprints of galaxies. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of collapsing nebulae, each explosion blooming in slow motion, scattering diamonds of fire across the horizon. A bridge of light materializes beneath your feet, stretching into the void. You walk, and with every step, your body becomes less *yours*. Your skin dissolves into motes of gold, your breath merges with the wind, and your mind unfurls like a scroll unspooling across eternity.  

You are everywhere at once.  

You are the antelope sprinting across a savanna that glows like molten copper, the ancient tree whose roots drink from underground rivers of magma, the moth circling a lantern in a city that floats on clouds. You are the ache of a mother’s longing, the joy of a first kiss, the terror of a falling star. Every life, every moment, threads of a tapestry you suddenly see in its entirety—a living, breathing entity that is neither matter nor spirit, but the song that binds them.  

And then, a shift. The vastness contracts, funnels itself into a single point of light within you. You are back in your body, kneeling on the cliff’s edge, but your hands are not hands—they are constellations, your tears not water but liquid time. The figures from the forest stand around you, their faces now clear: they are every version of yourself you have ever been or might become, gazing at you with eyes that hold infinite forgiveness.  

When you wake, the dream clings to you like perfume. The world feels thinner, as though the veil between the self and the infinite has been pierced. You carry the certainty that you are both a drop in the ocean and the ocean itself, a fleeting note in a symphony that has no end. And somewhere, deep in your marrow, the forest still grows, its glass branches whispering secrets to the stars.
