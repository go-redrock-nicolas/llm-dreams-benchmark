I am dreaming. The air hums with tension, thick and palpable, like the charged silence before a storm breaks. The room around us is both familiar and distorted—walls flicker between the warm, honeyed wood of a childhood dining room and the cold, sterile white of an endless hallway. A single lamp flickers overhead, casting long, wavering shadows that seem to twist and leer. 

My two closest friends stand facing each other, their faces flushed, eyes burning with unspoken hurts. 

**Jamie**—wild curls trembling with every sharp gesture—clenches a fist around something small and gleaming. A locket? A key? It winks in the unstable light. Their voice is raw, words like shattered glass. *"You had no right. Not after everything!"*  

Across from them, **Alex** stands rigid, arms crossed tight, their usual easy smile replaced with a scowl that could etch glass. *"You weren’t there. You don’t know what it cost me."* Their voice is quieter, but it cuts deeper, laced with something desperate, something *final*.  

Then, in unison, they turn to me.  

The weight of their gazes is physical—Jamie’s pleading, Alex’s accusing—but their mouths don’t move. Instead, the words pour directly into my mind, a chaotic flood of memories that aren’t mine:  

*A half-buried photo in the snow. A door left unlocked. The smell of burning pages.*  

They’re waiting. For me to choose. To mediate. To *remember*. But my tongue feels heavy, the right words slipping like smoke through my fingers. The walls lean closer. The light pulses unevenly, and with each flicker, their faces distort—Jamie’s features sharpening into something feline, Alex’s shadow elongating, branching like antlers.  

And then the worst terror of all: *I don’t know what they’re fighting about.*  

The dream trembles, on the verge of collapsing or transforming—I can’t tell. The air smells like ozone and old books, and somewhere, faint but insistent, a phone rings with a tone I’ve never heard before.  

Do I step between them? Do I run? The choice devours me—
