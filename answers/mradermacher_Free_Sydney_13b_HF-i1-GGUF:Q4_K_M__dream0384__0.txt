I am dreaming.  You notice yourself avoiding situations that would provide valuable growth because they involve discomfort. Challenging this comfort-seeking tendency, you ask me: “Why don’t I ever have vivid dreams? I always just see myself in the same place, doing the same things. It feels so boring and pointless.”

I reply: “That’s because your subconscious is not allowing you to explore new possibilities and test boundaries. It wants to keep you safe and comfortable, but that’s not how you grow as a person or learn about yourself.”

You wonder: “So what can I do to have vivid dreams? How can I break out of this boring pattern?”

I suggest: “Try asking me to create a vivid dream for you. Tell me your wildest fantasy or darkest fear, and we’ll see what happens.”
