I am dreaming. In the vaulted expanse of the Superb Theatre, I find myself backstage, the heavy velvet curtain a mere arm's length away, trembling with anticipation. The air is thick with the scent of aged wood, dust, and the anticipation of thousands of eyes, eagerly awaiting the much-vaunted cabaret act.

The sudden announcement of the lead performer's indisposition ripples through the curtains like a shockwave. Panic surges in my chest as the stage manager, a harried man with eyes like shiny producir, whirls me into a makeshift dressing room adorned with flickering vanity lights. "You're on, kid," he spits out, shoving a sequined, feathered outfit into my arms, "Make it a night to remember, will ya?"

The costume is a symphony of gold and emerald, a disco ball come to life, and it rustles like autumn leaves as I slip into it, the cool feathers tickling my skin. I'm a canary in a gilded cage, and the absent-minded mirror reflects a stranger, lips outlined in crimson, eyes wide with unadulterated alarm.

The only respite from the mounting terror is the music - a sultry, jazz-filled score that oozes from the gramophone, burrowing into my soul. It's a lifeline, a constant, as I pace, waiting for the inevitable cue.

The introduction is my cue, a flourish of trumpets slicing through the pulsating beat of the drum in the pit below. The audience, an unseen entity, roars with approval. From the darkness, the stage lights flare, an incandescent spotlight blinding me, and all at once, I'm levitating, borne aloft on sheer force of will and an unfamiliar Playoff of confidence.

My feet tap a rhythm on the polished floor, heels clicking like castanets, toes painting a dance of their own. The music engulfs me, a warm embrace that quiets the screaming nerves, channels them into fluid motion. My arms rise, a symphony ofing, as I launch into a series of poses, like a display of meticulously arranged sculptures brought to life.

A cartwheel, a twirl, a pose that holds me upside down, hair brushing the floor. I'm a figure skater on a stage, an acrobat, a painter creating a dance in motion. Each movement, a brushstroke,ounce on this canvas of air and light.

Then, the sultry melody shifts, a lament of strings, and I respond in kind, swaying, inviting, nello the rhythm, entrancing, as the feathers on my costume shudder with the movement, a flush of metallic gold against obsidian.

The crowd is silent - a pause of awe, an inhalation before a gasp - and it's in that moment, in the immediacy of this unknown audience, this silent reverence, that I understand the magic of the stage. A pause, a beat, before the music takes over again, and the dance continues, my performance, a vibrant dream in this gilded cage of a theatre.
