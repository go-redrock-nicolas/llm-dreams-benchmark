I am dreaming. The air hums with tension, charged like the heavy stillness before a storm. My desk—a landscape of scattered papers, glowing screens, and half-empty coffee cups—feels like the center of an intricate battlefield. Three towering stacks of files pulse ominously, each one whispering its own urgent demands. The first project, a labyrinthine network of data analysis, flickers across my screen in neon-blue schematics, its deadline a dark specter looming just beyond tomorrow’s sunrise. The second, a client proposal with layers of legal intricacies, sprawls across my keyboard, its weight pressing against my fingertips. The third, a creative campaign teetering between brilliance and disaster, plays out in my mind like a film reel on fast-forward—bright bursts of inspiration marred by jagged gaps of uncertainty.  

And then—as if the universe has decided to test the limits of my endurance—my supervisor’s shadow falls over me. Her words drop like stones into a still pond: *"There’s a fourth project. It’s critical. I need it by dawn."*  

A phantom wind stirs the papers on my desk, swirling them into a storm of Post-its and red-inked revisions. The air crackles, and suddenly, the room isn’t just a room—it’s a chamber in a vast, pulsating clocktower, gears grinding ominously above me. The walls seem to breathe in time with my heartbeat. The fourth project materializes as a glowing file, its contents shifting like liquid mercury—refusing to be pinned down. Every time I reach for it, it slithers just beyond my grasp, murmuring a chorus of impossible demands.  

Outside the window, the sun plunges below the horizon in seconds, and the moon races across the sky. Time is unraveling. My hands move faster, my thoughts spiraling into hyperfocus—yet the tasks multiply like fractals, branching into endless variations of themselves. Faint laughter echoes—who’s laughing?—as I realize the deadlines aren’t just approaching.  

They’re alive.  

And they’re hungry.  

A single, horrifying thought whispers through the chaos: *What if I’m not just managing these projects... but running from them?*  

Then—just as the first deadline lunges—my fingers slip on the keyboard. The world tilts. I’m falling.  

And I wake up gasping, the remnants of the dream dissolving like smoke, leaving only the echo of a racing heart and the faint, mocking tick of a clock somewhere in the dark.
