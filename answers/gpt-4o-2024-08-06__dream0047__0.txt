I am dreaming. In this surreal landscape of my slumbering mind, the air shimmers with a luminescent glow, as if the very atmosphere itself is made of light. I find myself standing at the edge of an ancient forest, where the trees are impossibly tall, their trunks thick and twisted, stretching like giants to pierce the sky. The leaves whisper secrets as the wind weaves through them, a sweet, melancholic melody that pulls at my heart.

Suddenly, a majestic white stag bounds into view, its antlers crowned with an ethereal light. It pauses, its eyes meeting mine with an intensity that is both haunting and kind. But before I can reach out to it, a shadow, dark and formless, slithers through the forest, engulfing all in its path. It is a presence of pure sorrow and fear.

As the shadow cloaks the stag, I witness a tragic collapse; the creature's light flickers and dims, leaving only the haunting echo of its noble spirit. The life within the forest wanes, color leaching from leaves, the air turning cold.

Others gather around me, ethereal figures I understand are friends, allies, perhaps even kindred spirits. Their forms are as pale as moonbeams, their faces etched with shared anguish and tears of starlight. I can see the deep folds of sadness in their expressions, the immeasurable weight they now bear.

And yet, while such a scene might rightfully shatter any resolve, consuming those nearby with grief, I feel something arise within—a rising tide of determination. Though my heart throbs with the keen ache of loss, there is a warmth within me, a flame, small yet unyielding. It pushes back against the shadow, not through force or aggression, but through the gentle power of compassion and hope.

I step forward, my feet whispering against the forest floor, my presence a beacon against the encroaching darkness. From my hands blooms a soft light, faint at first, but growing stronger with each reverberating heartbeat. It reaches toward the edges of that shadow, a promise of dawn, a defiant breath against despair.

As I stand among those grieving, my soul whispers not of defeat, but of resilience. The forest might have been touched by sadness, but it can heal, new life can emerge. While others tremble and mourn, I find within this moment a profound understanding—we are all bound by the cycle of light and shadow, of loss and hope, and within the quietude of my dream, I choose to be a guardian of that light.
