I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt lavender, and the sky above you ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting a version of the world that never was. You stand in the hallway of your childhood home, but the walls are made of translucent glass, etched with faint fingerprints that glow like phosphorescent ink. Behind each pane, scenes flicker—memories you recognize but cannot quite *feel*. Your mother laughing in the kitchen, her face half-obscured by a curtain of ivy that grows from her hair. Your father’s hands, too many fingers, arranging photographs into a collage that shifts when you blink.  

You touch the glass. It’s cold, but not unpleasantly so. The images warp. Now your mother is weeping into a telephone that dials itself, her tears pooling into a puddle that becomes a river, carving canyons into the floorboards. Now your father stands in a field of static, his mouth moving silently as black moths pour from his throat. You realize, with a calm that unsettles you, that these are not memories. They are *edits*. Carefully curated lies, stitched into the fabric of your mind like gold thread in a moth-eaten tapestry.  

A door appears at the end of the hallway, its surface a mirror. When you approach, your reflection does not mimic you. It smiles—a slow, serpentine thing—and gestures to a key hanging from your neck, warm against your chest. The key is made of bone, and it hums as you grasp it. The door unlocks with a sound like a sigh, and behind it lies a library.  

The library is infinite. Shelves spiral into a ceiling of swirling constellations, each book bound in skin, labeled with your family name. You pull one—*Mother, Volume III*—and its pages bleed ink that pools into words: *“She was never yours. You were carved from a wish and a wound.”* Another—*Father, Volume VII*—whispers, *“He traded his shadow to keep you alive. The debt is due.”*  

You wander, reading, until the books begin to scream. But you do not flinch. Instead, you climb a staircase that materializes beneath your feet, leading to a room where time folds like origami. Here, you see your parents as children, playing with a third figure—a girl with your eyes, your hands, your voice. But she dissolves when they touch her, leaving only a smear of ash on the air.  

“You were meant to forget her,” says a voice. It’s your own, but older, wearied by centuries. The walls of the room peel back like petals, revealing a chasm where the truth lies coiled—a serpent eating its own tail, its scales etched with names you’ve never heard but somehow know.  

You kneel at the edge. The serpent hisses, *“They buried us to protect you. But roots grow in darkness too.”*  

And still, you do not scream. You do not weep. You breathe in the metallic tang of the air, the weight of the revelation settling into your bones like sediment. The dream begins to fray at the edges, the library dissolving into a field of static, your parents’ faces flickering like broken televisions.  

When you wake, the key is gone. But the taste of ash remains. And somewhere, deep in your marrow, a root has taken hold.
