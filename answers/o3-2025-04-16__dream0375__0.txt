I am dreaming. …I find myself adrift in a vast, slow-turning sky, as though the whole horizon has forgotten which way is up or down. Colors slide across one another—petrol-blue melting into ember-gold—like oil in water. Somewhere in the distance a single bell tolls, not with sound exactly, but with a vibration that rustles the feathers of thought.

I realize this place is woven out of nothing but energy. Every object, every being, even the air itself, glimmers faintly, as though countless fireflies were stitched into its fabric. I hover on the edge of a floating causeway made of translucent crystal steps. Each step contains a memory: tiny silhouettes dance inside them, reliving moments I once loved or feared.  

Ahead, two types of figures wander. Some blaze with a comforting aurora—rose, aqua, honey-gold. Their glow pours toward me in gentle, warm rivers, filling my limbs with soft strength. Others drift like dim constellations whose stars have gone cold; they trail thin ribbons of ash-gray mist that tug at me, unraveling my warmth thread by thread.

I step forward. The crystal beneath my feet chimes, reading my emotional weight. When I pass the radiant travelers, my spine straightens, my thoughts sharpen, and a buoyant laughter seems to bubble up from my bones unbidden. When I brush too near the ashen shapes, I feel my knees weaken, as if gravity itself is thickening; a sudden fatigue fogs my senses.

I decide to explore the pattern. Beside the path stands a living sundial, petals of silver opening and closing with each pulse of my heart. Irridescent sand flows upward through its stem, defying time. I place a hand on its rim, and the dream pulls me inward, revealing scenes from waking life:

• There I am at a crowded café, listening to a friend who speaks in constant crisis. His words swirl like gnats, and with each anxious anecdote a small flicker is siphoned from my chest.  
• Then the image flips: another friend appears—one who laughs with her whole face. In her presence, my own colors brighten, and invisible filaments transmit a charge that feels like early sunlight on river water.  
• A third vignette: a relative whose conversation feels like walking through syrup—slow, sticky, exhaustive. The sand within the sundial darkens.  
• Finally, a mentor who asks a single, piercing question that sends champagne fizz through my nerve endings. My aura grows wider, brushing the edges of the vision itself.

The sundial closes its petals, sealing these observations. I’m returned to the crystalline bridge, now aware that the figures of light and shadow are personifications of my waking relationships: some restore, some deplete. My dream-self wonders: What makes the difference? The answer arrives in imagery rather than words—a library whose books bleed color onto the floor. Titles appear:

“Mutual Presence”  
“Respectful Listening”  
“Unspoken Resentments”  
“Shared Curiosity”  
“Transaction Disguised as Love”  

The pages flutter open, revealing threads that braid themselves into a single cord. I wrap this cord around my wrist; it hums with boundaries, discernment, gratitude.

A shimmering doorway materializes, fashioned from overlapping dragonfly wings. I step through and find a garden shaped like a mandala. Each petal-path leads to a unique person in my life, seated inside a gazebo of their own making. I watch: some gazebos have open arches that let sunlight flood in, while others are nearly opaque, draped in ivy that drinks light before it reaches the occupant. I feel my energy respond—expanding under the open arches, contracting under the vine-shaded ones.

In the center of the mandala, a fountain of quicksilver sings: “When you water others, do not forget to return to the source.” I cup my hands, drink, and my colors flare brighter than before. From this vantage I finally grasp the lesson:

1. Energy is currency—spend it, but also earn it back.  
2. Connection thrives on reciprocity; imbalance ferments into fatigue.  
3. Boundaries are not walls; they are membranes through which healthy exchange can occur.  
4. Gratitude is a natural generator; grievance is a slow leak.  

I bow to the fountain, to the sundial, to the luminous and the dim—teachers all. As I begin to wake, the dream folds itself like origami, tucking its images into corners of my mind to be unfolded tomorrow when choices press close.

The final note I hear is the bell again, but this time it rings clear, and I know it comes from my own heart rerouting its currents: protect, renew, illuminate.
