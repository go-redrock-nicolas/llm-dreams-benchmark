I am dreaming. I find myself wandering the busy streets of Tokyo, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and neon lights that illuminate the night sky. But despite being in the midst of such a vibrant, bustling city, I can't help but feel a deep sense of loneliness and unease. It's as if I'm completely disconnected from the world around me, a solitary figure lost in a sea of people.

Just as I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by this sense of isolation, I notice a group of kind-looking strangers watching me from across the street. There's an elderly Japanese man, his long white hair tied back in a traditional bun; a young couple, their hands intertwined and their faces glowing with loving affection; a street performer, his colorful kimono swirling around him as he expertly manipulates a trio of diabolos

These strange strangers approach me with compassionate eyes and sympathetic smiles. The elderly man bows his head forward, then generally points further down the block. I did't expect to get help offered me so easily by perfect strangers, with my helplessness so clear and visible emanating and shining from my body.

The elderly man nods at me, and then starts walking. He gestures for me to follow him. I nod back at the man, smile at the others, and then follow after him. The young couple walk behind me, and the street performer slowly recedes and becomes one of many street performers in the ever changing scene. Soon we are in an elevated enclosed walkway constructed high enough up from the surrounding ground that it high enough up to be considered an air space and not most people's normal level of street.
