I am dreaming. You stand at the edge of a vast, impossible city—a place stitched together from fragments of your memories and fears. The sky above bleeds watercolor hues: bruised purples melting into molten gold, as if the heavens themselves are undecided. Below, the ground splits into two paths. One is paved with polished obsidian, reflecting a version of yourself in a crisp suit, walking into a glass tower that stretches endlessly upward. The other is a writhing vine of cobblestones, overgrown with flowers that hum in harmonic whispers, leading to a labyrinth of murals, sculptures, and the scent of wet clay.  

You step forward, and the air thickens like syrup, slowing your movement. The obsidian path glows faintly, its surface etched with equations and timelines—deadlines, mortgages, retirement plans—each line a promise of safety. But the words shimmer and dissolve as you touch them, replaced by a child’s sketch of a dragon, its wings scribbled with the words *“What if?”*  

Behind you, a figure materializes: a version of your future self, wearing a tailored coat made of folded spreadsheets. They hold out a contract written in ink that smells like burnt coffee. “Sign here,” they say, their voice a monotone chorus of colleagues. “You’ll never starve. You’ll never *burn*.” But when you glance down, the contract’s fine print writhes into a poem you once wrote at 17, half-remembered and aching with longing.  

Suddenly, the vine-covered path surges upward, twisting into a spiral staircase that pierces the clouds. At its peak, a woman with a paintbrush for a finger and hair of liquid gold beckons. Her eyes are twin supernovae. “Come,” she sings, her voice a symphony of crashing waves and cello notes. “We’ll starve together. We’ll *burn*.” In her hand, she holds a canvas that shifts and pulses—a half-finished portrait of you, but freer, wilder, with constellations tangled in your hair.  

The city begins to fracture. Buildings melt into origami birds, streets fold into Möbius strips. The suited version of you starts climbing the obsidian tower, but their hands leave smears of paint. The artist’s staircase crumbles, yet each broken step blooms into a stained-glass butterfly. You feel yourself pulled in both directions, your ribs creaking as if your heart is splitting into two organs: one mechanical, ticking like a clock; the other feathered, beating in dissonant jazz rhythms.  

A choice must be made. But the dream refuses to let you choose. Instead, it forces you to *feel* both futures simultaneously. In one hand, the weight of a gold watch; in the other, the weight of a child’s sketchbook. In one ear, the hum of fluorescent lights; in the other, the roar of a crowd cheering your name after a performance you can’t remember. You taste the metallic tang of regret already, even as you haven’t moved.  

Then the ground gives way. You fall through a kaleidoscope of moments: a boardroom where your voice is a monotone; a garret where your hands are stained with ink and failure; a child’s laughter in a house you can’t afford; a gallery where no one claps. You hit the bottom—only to land on a trampoline of suspended starlight, bouncing higher with every failed draft, every rejected application, every compromise.  

The dream ends as you wake up gasping, your cheeks wet, your fingers twitching with phantom brushstrokes. The city still waits, half-built in your mind. The paths are still open. But the taste of both heavens—and both hells—lingers, sharp and undeniable.
