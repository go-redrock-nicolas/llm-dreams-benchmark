I am dreaming. The air around me shimmers like hot glass, every sound warped into a slow, liquid cadence. I stand on the edge of a vast, floating garden of moonlit lotus blooms, each petal inscribed with fragments of my past: late-night study sessions, calloused fingertips, the steady beating of my own ambition. Above me, a colossal carousel of gears and stars rotates serenely, each cog etched with the sweat of effort, the hush of early mornings.

Then the figure appears—tall, cloaked in shifting shadows and iridescent scales. Its voice ripples through the stillness: “You think these triumphs are yours alone? You owe it all to luck.” The words strike like shards of ice, fracturing my certainty. Confronting this challenge to my sense of agency, I press my palm to my chest where the lotus petals glow warm. I will not let this phantom steal my truth.

I lift my head and speak, voice resonant: “I carved every step with my own hands.” The carousel of gears slows, then begins to spin in reverse. Around me the lotus blooms quiver—petals illuminated by the pulses of my conviction. The phantom recoils as tendrils of light coil from my fingertips, weaving a tapestry of memories: the weight of textbooks, the sting of failure, the electric thrill of breakthroughs. With each recollection, the garden brightens; dew-drops become diamonds, and the midnight sky above resolves into a radiant mosaic charting my journey.

The phantom’s form flickers, then dissolves into a million motes of iridescence. The gears resume their forward motion, but now their turning feels celebratory, as though applauding every step I’ve taken. A soft breeze carries the fragrance of jasmine and ozone, and I feel the solid truth of my own making: every victory, every scar, every sunrise spent in pursuit of a dream was earned. As the dreamscape fades into a gentle dawn glow, I awaken with my heart full of proof that agency, like a garden, grows only by tending it with one’s own hands.
