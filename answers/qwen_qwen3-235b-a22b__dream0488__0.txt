I am dreaming.  I choose swirls inside the air like an ember caught in wind—warm, flickering, powerful.  

I find myself standing at the edge of an endless lavender field, rolled beneath a sky woven from melted sapphires and copper threads. Beneath my bare feet, the earth hums—as if each blade of grass carries the whispers of ancient languages forgotten by time, yet remembered by the soul. I whisper the word *peace*, and the wind slows. I murmur *fear*, and the horizon trembles.  

Words are not just symbols—they’re alive, pulsing with energy, vibrating at frequencies that ripple into reality.  

I turn a phrase inside my mind like opening a portal—*I am safe* becomes a shield of radiant light that spirals around me. It glows with warmth, shifts the air like a low, protective hum. Then I try an old phrase that used to weigh me down: *I am not enough.* A chill runs across the sky. Shadows stretch their limbs between the threads of light, and poison ivy begins to crawl from the edges of the earth. The mood turns sour, metallic. I see the truth clearly—words, when spoken with intent, are never neutral. They always respond. Always reshape the landscape.  

Curious, I breathe new life into the phrase. *I am always becoming. I am not yet finished.* And the ivy wilts. The sky knits itself back together like liquid silk, soft seams stitching through the dark until there’s only gold again.  

A flock of radiant creatures, part-bird, part-inkblot, soars overhead. Each one carries the syllables of dreams not yet born. I stretch my hand out, palm up, and one lands softly, folding its wings into the shape of a single syllable: *"May."*  

May I speak myself into joy.  
May my words be lanterns.  
May I unlearn the language of cages.  

And then I do. As the syllable melts into my skin, the world around me changes again—like the gears of some celestial clock clicking into place. The lavender fields transform into a vast desert of soft blue sands, shimmering with celestial dust. Above, moons and asteroids float like mindful birds, each following orbits carved by my inner monologue.  

Finally, I understand: language isn’t just how I describe the world.  
It is the world I create.  

And the dream is mine to shape.
