I am dreaming. ...start to feel the icy water seeping into my shoes, the cold creeping up my ankles like a thousand tiny fingers. The elevator, once a mundane metal box, now feels like a suffocating coffin, its stainless steel walls closing in on me with every passing second. The water level rises with an eerie slowness, its surface glinting like a mirror in the faint fluorescent light that still flickers overhead.

Panic sets in, my heart racing like a jackrabbit as I frantically press the alarm button, again and again, hoping against hope that someone, anyone, will hear my distress call. But the only response is the mournful wail of the alarm, echoing off the walls as the water continues its relentless ascent.

The air is growing thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. I'm hyperventilating, my lungs burning from the lack of oxygen. I try to calm myself, to think clearly, but my mind is a jumble of fear and desperation. I'm trapped, with no escape in sight.

The water is now waist-deep, its chill seeping into my bones. I can feel it seeping into my pores, numbing my skin. I'm starting to feel disoriented, my sense of balance compromised by the confined space and the rising water. The elevator's control panel, once a mundane array of buttons and lights, now seems like a cruel joke, its buttons and levers rendered useless by the deluge.

As the water continues to rise, I start to feel a strange sense of detachment, as if I'm observing this nightmare from outside my body. I see myself, standing in the elevator, my eyes wide with fear, my skin pale and clammy. I'm frozen in terror, unable to move or escape.

The water is now chest-deep, and I'm starting to feel the weight of it bearing down on me. I'm struggling to keep my head above the surface, my lungs burning from the exertion. I'm aware of the irony – I'm trapped in a metal box, drowning in a sea of water, with no way out.

In a desperate bid to escape, I start to feel around the elevator's walls, searching for a hidden release mechanism or a weak spot to exploit. My fingers scrabble against the smooth metal, but there's nothing – no handhold, no lever, no escape route. I'm trapped, and the water is still rising.

As the water closes in around my neck, I feel a sense of resignation wash over me. I'm going to drown, trapped in this elevator, with no one to save me. The thought is both terrifying and surreal, like something out of a bad dream. And yet, even as I'm consumed by fear, a part of me remains detached, watching this macabre scene unfold with a morbid fascination.

The water is now lapping at my chin, and I'm struggling to keep my mouth and nose above the surface. I'm aware of the sound of my own ragged breathing, the gurgle of the water as it rises, and the creaking of the elevator's metal walls as they strain against the pressure.

As the water finally engulfs my face, I'm plunged into darkness, the world around me reduced to a single, terrifying sensation – the feeling of being drowned, alone and unrescued, in a tiny, metal coffin...
