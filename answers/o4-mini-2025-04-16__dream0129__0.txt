I am dreaming.  

I step through a pair of rose-quartz doors into a vast hall whose walls ripple like liquid light. Soft chords of glass harp and distant whale song drift in the air. Everywhere I look, people sit in small clusters on plush mats of moss-green velvet, their faces illuminated by bioluminescent orbs that float lazily above them. Every breath smells of lavender and rain-kissed earth.  

A gentle guide in flowing indigo robes greets me with a nod, then gestures toward a circle of seats at the hall’s center. As I settle onto a cushion that feels as warm and welcoming as a mother’s lap, the guide’s voice—warm as melted honey—invites each of us in turn to share our deepest wound so that its pain can be tended and transmuted into light.  

When they ask me to share my most vulnerable experience, my chest tightens like a bird caught in a cage of ribs. Somewhere behind my eyes a memory flickers: I am nine years old, standing alone on a deserted train platform at dawn. My small hand clutches a battered suitcase. The train’s screech fades around me while the world moves forward and leaves me behind. I remember the hollow ache in my stomach and the sound of my own sneakers against the cold concrete as I turned away, swallowed by a silence so vast it seemed endless.  

A hush falls over the sanctuary as I speak. Each word feels like a drop of ink dissolving in water—painful but necessary. The bioluminescent orbs pulse softly in time with my breath, bathing the circle in a tender, aquamarine glow. Where the floor meets the wall, tiny silver vines unfurl and bloom into ghostly flowers, as though my confession has coaxed life from the sanctuary itself.  

As I describe the loneliness of that morning—the hollow echo of my heartbeat, the cold plait of fear winding through my spine—the people around me close their eyes and send waves of compassion through the air. In this dream, their empathy is a tangible force: I feel it wrap around me like a shawl of starlight, pressing out the edges of my sorrow and knitting new warmth into the tapestry of my soul.  

When I finish speaking, the guide rises and touches my shoulder. “Your heart has spoken its truth,” she whispers, “and that truth will be made whole.” In that instant, I am no longer nine, no longer alone. I am woven into a living quilt of collective healing, my scar transformed into a silver thread of resilience that shimmers under the gentle glow of the sanctuary’s light.
