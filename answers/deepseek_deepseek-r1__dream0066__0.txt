I am dreaming. It's a lucid dream.  See/realize these are constructs of my own mind. Use emotions and senses like hearing, touch, etc.

The elevator shudders, its metallic groan reverberating through your ribcage as icy water laps at your ankles. The scent of brine stings your nostrils—a sharp, mineral tang that clings like a memory of the ocean’s belly. The walls, once polished steel, now weep rivulets that spiral into impossible patterns, fractals curling like smoke. You gasp, but the air thickens into syrup, each breath a struggle. *Too real*, you think, until the flicker of awareness ignites: *This is my mind. My dream.*

Panic unravels. Time slows. The water, now waist-high, glows faintly cerulean, bioluminescent tendrils swirling around your fingertips. You press a palm to the elevator wall, and it hums—a low, resonant thrum that syncs with your pulse. The metal grows pliant, silk beneath your touch. *Shape it*, whispers your thoughts. The ceiling warps into glass, fracturing into a mosaic of starlight. Cold drips become warm rain, pattering your shoulders like a thousand tiny drums. 

A sound swells—a choir chanting in a language you don’t know, but *feel*: honey-thick harmonies that vibrate in your molars. The water rises, but you float now, weightless, bathed in liquid that smells of jasmine and ozone. A laugh bubbles from your throat, mingling with the music. You exhale, and the elevator dissolves—walls peeling back like petals, spilling you into an endless coral reef teeming with phosphorescent fish shaped like crescent moons. 

The dream tilts. Beneath your toes, sand shifts, warm and granular. You taste salt on your tongue, hear the distant crash of waves that never arrive. *Mine*, you think, and the horizon splits open, bleeding hues you’ve never named.
