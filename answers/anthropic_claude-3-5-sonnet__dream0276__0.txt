I am dreaming. I find myself in a world where every small gesture radiates with unprecedented significance. A falling leaf catches my eye, and its gentle descent fills me with an overwhelming sense of joy that cascades through my entire being. The simple act of catching a drop of morning dew on my fingertip sends waves of euphoria coursing through my nervous system, as if I've discovered an ancient treasure.

I notice that my footsteps leave behind shimmering impressions that pulse with a soft, bioluminescent glow – each step rewarding me with a chorus of tiny wind chimes that only I can hear. The air around me feels thick with possibility, and even breathing feels like an achievement worthy of celebration, each inhale tasting like liquid starlight.

In this dream-state, I find myself collecting seemingly mundane objects – a smooth pebble, a discarded bottle cap, a twisted paperclip – but each one fills me with an inexplicable sense of accomplishment that borders on ecstasy. These small treasures begin to float around me in a lazy orbit, each one trailing ribbons of memory and meaning.

The strangest part is how this heightened sensitivity to reward makes perfect sense within the dream's logic. I understand, with dream-clarity, that I've tapped into some fundamental frequency of the universe where every atomic interaction is a cause for celebration. A butterfly landing nearby feels like winning an Olympic medal, and successfully tying my shoelace feels like solving world hunger.

As I move through this hypersensitive dreamscape, I begin to wonder if perhaps this is how children experience the world – where every small discovery is earth-shattering and every tiny victory is worth celebrating with your whole heart. The thought brings tears to my eyes, but they float upward instead of falling, forming a constellation of emotional memories above my head.

The dream continues to spiral into increasingly intense reactions to increasingly minute events, until even the space between thoughts becomes a source of indescribable satisfaction...
