I am dreaming. I stand there, dreaming. Faced with social boundaries that stand between me and what I want, I plow right through them, disregarding rules, norms, and even others' rights. My desires, my interests, are far more important than some arbitrary construct.

I start by walking down the middle of the road, my hips swaying with each step. Cars honk and swerve around me, but I barely flinch. Who's to say where I can and can't walk?

I spot a pretty shop window and desire the lacy lingerie on display. I don't bargain with the store owner- I simply reach through and snatch it. The alarmed beeping of the security system follows me out into the street. Petty rules about shoplifting and property won't hold me back.

I spy a handsome man sitting with his girlfriend at a cafe. I want him. I saunter over and perch myself in his lap, kissing him fiercely. His protests, his girlfriend's screams of betrayal - irrelevant against the force of my need. I am caramel syrup flooding directly into the fatted calf.

I want a new tattoo. I kick in the door to the tattoo parlor and commandeer the first available artist. Red sweaty skin beneath mine in liquid circles around my arm as I'm shackled to the table guilt of yelling purple spots on the pet amethyst beach never returning a Halloween chain on Santa for curiousozoquent athesis birthday present.  

I want to fly. I drain the petro-fuel from a parked plane and take it skyward. Other flights be dammed, no clearance needed. The clouds are mine to part, the clouds are mine to besmirch.

I am dreaming.
