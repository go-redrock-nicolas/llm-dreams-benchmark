I am dreaming.

In this vivid trance, I find myself high in the alpine wilderness—far above any tree line, where the snow lies thick and undisturbed, glinting ice-blue beneath a heavy sky. My breath hangs in the bitter, crystalline air as I gaze downstream at a valley lost in darkening shadows. But the mountainside beneath my boots vibrates—a subtle growl in the bones, a warning that pulses up through the crust of snow.

With a sudden shudder, fissures snake outward in spiderweb patterns, the cracks opening with slow grace, as if the mountain itself is stretching awake. The snow underfoot sags, groans, and begins its inexorable slide. The world erupts in roaring white—the familiar landscape vanishes in a chaos of whirling flakes and thunderous vibration.

I kick my skis, desperate, surging sideways, but the snow gives way, sending me tumbling into a storm of my own making. Light fractures through the maelstrom in shards of blue and silver; I spiral weightless, locked in the storm’s cold embrace. My mind detaches—glimpsing above, a sky split by auroras, ribbons of emerald and violet weaving themselves in impossible patterns, beckoning from beyond the ashen shroud.

Suddenly, time slows, the avalanche freezing mid-rush. The ice crystals shimmer like diamonds suspended in a sunbeam, and I, weightless, drift through these frozen jewels. All is silent except for the distant, haunting call of a snow owl gliding beneath the green curtains of northern lights. The fear recedes, replaced by awe at this strange, quiet place between disaster and deliverance—a parallel realm perched on the knife-edge between waking and dreaming.

Here, in the heart of the storm, I reach out my hand, feeling the cold spark of a snowflake pause on my palm, glowing with a life all its own—a reminder that even in avalanches, even in fear, beauty and wonder still bloom, wild and untamable, at the deepest layers of the dreaming mind.
