I am dreaming. I observe myself standing on a pale-gray sidewalk, the midday sun warming the back of my arms. My shadow stretches out in front of me. Across the street, a crowd has gathered, admiring something I can’t yet see—a hum of voices and the occasional burst of laughter carries over to me. Curiosity nudges me forward. I can't move. 

I look into the storefront window. 

I see a flyer advertising a romantic novel called Scent of Eden. 

Written by Karen Hawkins. 

I have never heard of Karen Hawkins. Gross. Why do I care? 

I look deeper into the window. 

I see a single rose, brown and withered, and a perfect model of the human skeleton sitting crossed-legged on a throne, reading Scent of Eden. 

A grim reaper reads a romance novel. 

A rib and two vertebrae are off the skeleton’s bones; they are on the ground, free from the skeleton, free from Eden. 

A gust of wind stirs up. 

Nobody notices me looking into their storefront window. They don’t notice me at all. 

I look up to the sky, sheepishly, and blush. 

As I look to the sky, I see a flock of birds pass overhead. Long black feathers come off their wings and gently fall to the earth in waves around me. 

I walk away, embarrassed and carrying two black feathers near my feet. 

Why am I feeling jealous of Karen Hawkins? I just stumbled across a flyer in a window. 

“Look at me!” I yell inside my head. “I can write books too!” The thought of someone else succeeding in an area I care about eats me alive. 

I can’t stop thinking about all the other books I have written, and how they could be marketed, and how they could be sold, and how they could make me rich. 

I start to cry, and my tears turn into black feathers that fall from the sky. 

Suddenly, I realize I’m not on the sidewalk anymore. I’m in a dark forest, surrounded by towering trees with barren branches that seem to stretch endlessly into the sky. The ground is covered in a thick layer of black feathers. 

I hear a rustling in the distance. 

I turn around … but there’s nothing there. 

I start to panic. 

I run through the forest, the feathers sticking to my feet like glue. 

The trees grow closer together, their branches reaching out to grab me. 

I hear a voice behind me. “Why are you running?” 

I turn around, and there’s the skeleton from the storefront window. 

It’s no longer reading Scent of Eden. 

It’s holding out the rose. 

The rose is no longer withered and brown. It’s vibrant and full of life, its petals glowing with an otherworldly light. 

I feel like I’m going to cry. 

“Why are you running?” the skeleton asks again. 

I can’t speak. 

“You’re not afraid of me,” the skeleton says. “You’re afraid of yourself.” 

I want to argue, but I can’t. 

“You’re afraid of your own potential,” the skeleton says. “You’re afraid of what you’re capable of.” 

I look at the rose. Its petals are glowing brighter now, their light illuminating the skeleton’s face. 

“Take it,” the skeleton says, holding out the rose. 

I reach out and take the rose. 

Its petals feel warm and soft against my skin. 

“You don’t need to be jealous of Karen Hawkins,” the skeleton says. “You don’t need to be jealous of anyone. You have everything you need within you.” 

I feel a sense of clarity wash over me. 

“You are capable of great things,” the skeleton says. “You just have to believe in yourself.” 

I look down at the rose in my hand. Its petals are no longer glowing. They’re just petals. 

But they’re still beautiful. 

I look up at the skeleton. 

“You have everything you need within you,” the skeleton says again. “Now go and create something beautiful.” 

I feel a surge of energy. 

I turn and start walking through the forest, the feathers no longer sticking to my feet. 

I walk with purpose. 

I walk with confidence. 

I walk with the knowledge that I am capable of greatness. 

I don't know where I'm going, but that doesn't matter. 

I know that I’ll find my way. 

I am on a pale-gray sidewalk, the midday sun warming the back of my arms. Ahead of me I see Karen Hawksin and a copywriter of Scent of Eden, with a single rose in her hand. She smiles at me, then hands me the rose and walks away. As Karen walks away, I hear a voice saying, “Now it’s your turn.” 

I realize it was never about Karen Hawkins. 

The rose is in my hand, and I hold it close to my chest. 

I take a deep breath. 

I know what I must do. 

I sit down on the sidewalk and begin to write.
