I am dreaming. I am lying on a beach, feeling the gritty sand beneath my toes and watching the waves crash onto the shore. The sun is setting, casting hues of pink and orange across the sky, and the air smells faintly of salt and seaweed. I close my eyes and let the sound of the waves lull me into a peaceful state. 
As the waves calm, they begin to morph into images(I see flashes of my past, moments I thought I had long forgotten. I see myself arguing with an ex-partner, the sound of our voices echoing in my mind. I see the hurt in their eyes and feel the weight of my words. I see myself standing before this situation, unable to move, trapped by my own emotions. 
Suddenly, the waves come crashing back, washing over me and pulling me out to sea. I struggle to keep my head above water, gasping for air as I am pulled deeper and deeper. The water is cold and dark, and I can feel the weight of my past dragging me down. 
But then, I see a light. It's faint at first, but it grows brighter and brighter until I can see it clearly. It's a vision of myself(breaking free from the past, standing tall and strong, no longer weighed down by old emotions. I see myself walking away from this past, leaving it behind me, and stepping into a new future. 
I wake up from the dream, feeling lighter and more free than I have in a long time. I realize that the weight of the past doesn't have to hold me back, that I can break free and move forward into a brighter future.
