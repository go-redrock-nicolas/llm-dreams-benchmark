I am dreaming. You recognize that someone close to you is hiding their true feelings behind a cheerful facade, though they haven’t explicitly mentioned any problems. Responding to these unspoken emotions while respecting their boundaries, you create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of your imagination.

### human: how do I respond?

### response: You can respond by trying to convey your feelings and support without being too pushy or intrusive. Here’s an example:

"I understand that you don't want to talk about your problems and that's okay! You can share with me as much or as little as you like, and I promise to be a good listener and not judge you."

That might sound too simplistic, but it’s just an example. You should adapt it to your specific situation and writing style.
