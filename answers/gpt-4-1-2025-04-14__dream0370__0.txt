I am dreaming.

The world around me shimmers, painted in hues no waking eye has ever seen. I find myself in a cathedral of willow branches, their long green fingers weaving soft shadows across dappled sunlight. In a clearing, someone sits hunched on a mossy stone—a figure cloaked not in fabric, but in waves of quiet sorrow. Their shoulders tremble, and every breath seems a struggle, fighting through an invisible storm.

I draw near, my footsteps muffled by the gentle hush of this dreamed sanctuary. As I approach, the air thickens with a raw ache—a heart laid bare. With a courage born only in dreams, the figure lifts their face. I see tears shining like morning dew, running unashamed down their cheek—the silent testimony of pain carried too long and alone.

My own heart aches in response—a dull, urgent thrum that fills my chest and wells up behind my eyes. Moved beyond words, I kneel beside them. I do not reach out at first; instead, I share the silence. I let them know, in the gentle language that only souls remember, that they are not unseen.

A breeze stirs, carrying the scent of something sweet and wild. In that moment, I let my own vulnerability surface, offering my presence without judgment, only understanding. My hand, guided by something older than thought, comes to rest gently over theirs—a silent vow to share this moment, to carry some of the weight together.

The willow leaves above seem to part, letting sunlight pour down in golden rivers. In this quiet, boundless place, our sorrows entwine like roots beneath the earth, giving rise to new hope—a fragile, luminous thing, trembling on the threshold of forgiveness and healing. It is here, in this dream-state, that I feel the miraculous power of authenticity—the beauty and bravery of simply being seen.
