I am dreaming. You stand at the precipice of a vast, smoldering chasm, with waves of volcanic heat rising from the depths below. The ground beneath your feet trembles as a massive dragon emerges from the shadows, its scales glinting like polished obsidian. The beast's eyes burn with ancient, otherworldly intelligence as it fixing you with an unblinking stare. A resonant voice echoes in your mind, challenging you to prove yourself worthy by solving an impossible riddle within mere moments, or face being cast into the abyss.
