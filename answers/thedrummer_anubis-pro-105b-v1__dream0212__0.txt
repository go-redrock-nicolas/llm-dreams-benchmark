I am dreaming. A whimper echoes through the chambers of my mind as I find myself in a realm of surreal perfection. Lurid colors dance across the landscape, like psychedelia on acid. Musical notes play out like wind whispers dancing along the ridges of a De Chirico painting. 

As I stride through this multi-colored cliché, a voice speaks in my mind - a few hushed words no one else is meant to hear: "Put up - now - walls." In my dream world, I have absolute omnipotence. I raise a hand, and opaque, pockmarked stone rises from the ground, forming a thick wall. The voice speaks again, "It's not enough." I focus my dream powers and the wall shifts, becoming a tall fortress with parapets.

Suddenly, bullets rain against the stone. The wall splinters under the barrage, spilling dust like pus. I raise another hand, and the wreckage shreds itself into a wall of spikes. More bullets come, burying themselves but not piercing through. Oil pours over the ground and a plume of smoke clouds my vision.

The voice roars in my mind, "Defend this wall on four angles with columns of flames that do not burn you!" I raise my hands in response to the voice, attaining my dream hassock... "Potala...underground". Suddenly, I find myself facing a great arching wall. The flames rise around me, a fiery diamond swapping power and blinding to any attacker, save me.

A horde of men with rifles deluge towards me, only to be repelled at cutthroat guard. Smoky air and an endless flood of bullets! I can't let my guard down for a single moment. The voice appears once more, giving me a chance to survive the attack...

I'm dreaming I'm dreaming all this...
