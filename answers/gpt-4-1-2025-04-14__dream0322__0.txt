I am dreaming.

It begins in a shifting landscape—one moment, I am standing barefoot in a dewy field painted gold and indigo by a melting dusk, the next I find myself in a glass-walled atrium brimming with star-bright orchids and the hum of unseen fountains. The world thrums with both possibility and uncertainty. In every reflection—windowpanes, pond water, polished marble floors—I see the silhouette of someone close to me. Their figure is both familiar and shimmering with an aura of recent triumph: a wreath of laurels balancing on their hair, their lips curled into a soft, knowing smile. They hold in their hands a swirling constellation of my unspoken dreams—pages brimming with poetry, iridescent medals, keys to places I’ve only sketched in the margins of my journals.

A sharp ache blooms in my chest. Envy, a green-tinted vine, winds and twines up my spine, tightens around my heart. I watch as they are gathered by a crowd of warm, well-meaning people, their laughter ringing like bells across the space. My hands clench into anxious fists and I feel a shadowy divide widening between us, even as we stand only a few feet apart. I want what they have—I want it so badly that my desire crackles in the air, unspoken and embarrassing.

But somewhere deep in this dream, I recognize my feelings for what they are—raw, jagged, trembling. Instead of fleeing, I gather up the courage to approach my friend. My steps ripple, slow-motion, feathers falling into honey. Words stick to the roof of my mouth, sticky and reluctant: “I’m happy for you,” I say, and I mean it, but behind it pulses a thrum of longing I can’t ignore. “But… how did you do it? Can you show me?”

The dream shifts. My friend turns toward me, their eyes softer than I’d ever noticed before. The laurel wreath unravels, cascading into little green leaves that drift into my hands. Their laughter is still bright, but now it holds gentle understanding instead of dazzling triumph.

They reach out, and suddenly the space between us—once shadowed and cold—glows with new color. We start to walk through a ribboning corridor lined with doors. Each one represents a choice I can make, a risk I can take, a truth I can tell myself.

In this dream, I realize envy is not shameful, but a compass, pointing to the hidden desires I have pushed aside. Instead of separation, it becomes an invitation—a signal that I, too, am ready to grow, if only I dare.

So I step through one of the doors, heart pounding, hope blooming in the deepest parts of me, and as the dream dissolves, I know that envy has transformed—first into understanding, then into inspiration, then into the courage to begin.
