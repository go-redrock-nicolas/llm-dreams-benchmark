I am dreaming. As I drifted into the peaceful slumber, my mind transported itself to a tranquil haven. Surrounded by towering tree leaves and lush greenery, I found myself at a serene retreat designed specifically for individuals grappling with the exact same struggles and demons that I had been silently battling. The atmosphere was one of understanding and empathy, a safe space to unburden one's true selves without fear of judgment or rejection.
