I am dreaming. I find myself in a shimmering library where the books float like autumn leaves caught in a gentle breeze. The shelves stretch impossibly high, disappearing into a ceiling of swirling cosmic dust and distant stars. As I try to focus on catching one of the drifting tomes, my attention keeps being pulled toward a pulsing, opalescent door at the far end of the room.

Behind that door, I somehow know, lies the source of my distraction - a swirling vortex of unspoken words and unresolved feelings. The air grows thick with emotion, taking on a deep indigo hue that matches my mounting anxiety. Every time I attempt to organize the floating books or decipher their ever-changing text, the door's soft throbbing grows more insistent.

The emotional weight manifests as crystalline tears that float upward instead of falling, each one containing miniature scenes of past conversations and missed opportunities. My fingers pass through them like smoke, but they leave traces of warmth and regret on my skin.

Suddenly, the bookshelves begin to fold into themselves like paper origami, creating new pathways that all seem to lead to that haunting door. The gravitational pull of the unresolved situation becomes nearly unbearable. Even the ink from the books begins to run, forming meandering rivers of letters that flow toward the door's threshold.

I try to busy myself with counting the stars that have now fallen onto the library floor like scattered diamonds, but each one reflects back the face of someone connected to my emotional turmoil. The task of maintaining focus becomes as impossible as holding water in cupped hands, my thoughts consistently flowing back to what lies beyond that shimmering doorway...

The dream pulses with the rhythm of an anxious heart, each beat bringing me closer to the inevitable confrontation with what I've been avoiding. The library continues its subtle transformation, becoming both a sanctuary and a maze, reflecting the complexity of emotional entanglement and the futile attempt to distract oneself from what must eventually be faced.
