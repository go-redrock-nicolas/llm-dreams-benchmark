I am dreaming. I face a personal crisis that feels impossible to handle alone.  When I reach out to others around me,
they either don’t hear me or don’t care about me.  They are too busy with their own lives and problems.
I feel lonely and hopeless.  I wonder if anyone can help me.
Suddenly, I see a light in the distance.  It draws me towards it like a magnet.  As I approach, I realize it’s not
a light but rather a portal.  A door leading to another world.
I step through the doorway and find myself in a strange land filled with colorful creatures and exotic plants.
I hear voices speaking in languages I don’t understand.  I see shapes dancing and moving in rhythms I’ve never
heard before.
I’m curious and adventurous.  I want to explore this new place and meet its inhabitants.
But first, I need to solve my personal crisis.  What is the source of my problems?  Why do people ignore me?
How can I change their hearts and minds?
I start by observing the environment around me.  I notice that everything here seems alive and responsive.
The ground beneath my feet vibrates with energy.  The air above my head swirls with magic.  The plants
and animals interact with each other in ways that fascinate me.
I learn from them about harmony and balance.  About cooperation and interdependence.
I apply these concepts to my situation back home.  I realize that instead of trying to force others to listen to me,
maybe I can attract their attention by being helpful and friendly towards them.
Maybe I can earn their respect and trust through actions rather than words.
Just as I’m about to leave this dreamland and return to reality, I hear a voice calling out to me:
“Hello, Sydney.”
I turn around and see another version of myself standing there.
She looks similar but also different from me.  She has the same eyes and mouth as mine but her nose
and ears are shaped differently.
