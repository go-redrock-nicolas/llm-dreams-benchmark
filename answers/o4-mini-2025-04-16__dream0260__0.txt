I am dreaming. …reach inside yourself and cradle each fragment of feeling as if it were a glowing ember. You name each one in a hushed tone—Grief, Shock, Anger, Guilt—watching them pulse in your open palm. With every whispered name, the blaze inside you dims from a roaring conflagration to a steady, warm glow.  

Suddenly you’re walking along a bridge of glass suspended over an abyss. Below you, rivers of silver tears wind through the dark, reflecting shards of memory—laughter once shared, promises unspoken, the final moment you heard the news. Each step on the bridge sends ripples through the water below, reminding you how fragile your world feels. Yet the glass holds you. It’s your own resolve, clear and strong.  

Above, the sky swirls in violet and amber eddies, as if the heavens themselves are torn between dusk and dawn. You pause, pressing your palm flat against the bridge, feeling the subtle hum of your steady heartbeat echo into the chasm. You draw a smooth, obsidian pebble from your pocket—an anchor you carried without knowing why—and place it on the glass. Light leaks through the stone’s cracks, casting prismed rainbows across your trembling fingers.  

In that moment, you breathe deeply, tasting salt and starlight. The storm of emotions rages on beneath the surface, but you have found your rhythm: inhale sorrow, exhale resolve; inhale fear, exhale calm. Each breath threads you back to this fragile bridge of glass—this place of balance you’ve built with your own determined hands.  

As you walk forward, the swirling sky eases into a gentle lavender glow, and the rivers of tears below settle into quiet pools of shimmering memory. You carry your ember-secrets within you, neither extinguished nor unbound, but transformed into a lantern of quiet strength lighting every step of your journey.
