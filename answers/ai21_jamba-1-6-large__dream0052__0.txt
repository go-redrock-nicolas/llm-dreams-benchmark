I am dreaming. It's a hazy orange twilight and I've stopped the car to chase the sun. 

I've just left my father's lawyer's office and the cool, sun-drenched hills of the quiet backroads tickle me with déjà vu. 

I won't forget the attorney's alarm when he saw my father's face in mine. He lingered on me for a moment, disarmed by my resemblance. It's not a trick of the eye, not a fleeting illusion– I looked so much like my father that the elderly attorney's mouth fell open. I smothered a laugh and longed to ask him, "What did he look like?" 

The doors here smell like San Quentin and I'm sure my father was a free man when he came in. The bright carpet is clean, the walls quiet and pristine with their eggshell background and gold-lettered plaques. I was the tiger in the room, neither fully dressed in pride nor nakedly timid like my company. 

My father's calm move to buy this old widow's house while she laid on her deathbed was quick and cruel and brilliant. The attorney was waiting for my roars, but I couldn't connect with the poor widow in my bones. I watched the rain crying down the window behind her when she told me how my father must have loved her. Her voice cracked with little sobs and she shivered but I didn't hear her. Her slender hands rattled with too much jewelry and I watched her lips move wondering what she would taste like if I kissed her. 

The sun is setting. The moon is full and there are a thousand stars in the sky. Shadows dance across the pale orange walls of my father's new house.

She was his prey. 
I'm humored as I think about what my father would have become if he hadn't been sent away so young. He was so hungrily ambitious that nothing and no one got in his way. My father's business partner told me once how he'd wanted to throw a man off the dome of the capital building to prove a point. That was over breakfast Benny and I laughed until we coughed through tears into our eggs Benny and I'll never forget the hunger in his green eyes when he described the drop.

I laugh out loud. I wonder if a star fell with me. I hope my father's watching somewhere and he burns with jealousy. 
"You're a pale shade," I taunt him and no one but the shadows. 

I jump when I hear a scuffle in the house behind me. I hadn't noticed her before and I wonder why she waited to move, like she was ready to pounce if I'd heard footsteps sooner. The little house creaks gently as if to soothe her. 
She's wearing my father's Army coat. I didn't see her before because she was pressed against the far wall behind a stack of moving boxes. She's been watching me for who knows how long. 

"How long were you standing there?" 
She's been waiting for me to notice her. She must've been, she's cautious in how she steps toward me. Her small, honey-colored hands twist together nervously. I can't stop my laugh from escaping. 
"I'm here for my things."

It's been a week since my father passed, so I can't tell how long she's been hiding in his house. I've been so preoccupied with my own drama that I haven't stopped to think about the woman who's been living in my father's house. It's obvious she's been here for a while. She's wearing his coat, for God's sake. 
I don't recognize her, but she looks familiar. Am I imagining things, or did I see her at the funeral? 
"Who are you?" I ask. 
"I'm Livia," she says. 
"Livia," I repeat, trying to place her name. 
"I'm his wife," she says, like it's obvious. "His estranged wife," she clarifies. 
"How estranged?" I ask. 
She steps toward me, her eyes narrowed. "How estranged do you think?" 
"I don't know," I say, though I do. They haven't spoken in years. 
"How estranged do you think?" she repeats. 
"Not estranged enough to keep you from taking his coat." 
Her eyebrows jump, surprised. "You noticed that?"
"Of course I noticed that."
"It's mine."
"How so?"
"It was a gift."
"A gift?"
"Yes."
"From my father?"
"Yes."
"And you're taking it now?"
"Yes."
"Because he's dead?" I ask.
"Yes."
"That's cold."
"It's my coat," she says, like it's obvious. 
"How long were you married?" I ask.
"Twenty-three years."
"How long have you been living here?" I ask.
"Since he died."
"And you're just now coming out to get your coat?" I ask.
"Yes."
"Because he's dead?" I ask again.
"Yes."
"And you're just now telling me this?"
"Yes," she says. 
She steps toward me and I feel her eyes on me. 
"How long were you standing there?" I ask again.
"Long enough," she says. 
"Long enough for what?" I ask.
"Long enough to know you're just like him," she says. 
"What do you mean?" 
"You're a cold bastard," she says. 
"Is that why you're taking his coat?"
"It's my coat," she says. 
"You're taking his coat because he's dead and you're cold."
"Yes."
"That's fucked up," I say.
"It's mine," she says. 
"I don't care if it's yours. I'm taking it back."
"It's my coat," she says. 
"I'm not going to argue with you about this."
"You're not going to argue with me about this?" she asks.
"No," I say. 
"You're not going to argue with me about this?" she asks again.
"No."
"Why not?" she asks.
"Because it's my coat," I say. 
"It's my coat," she repeats. 
"Yes," I say. 
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It's mine."
"Yes."
"It'
