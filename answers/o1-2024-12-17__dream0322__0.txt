I am dreaming. …open your eyes in a place that’s both entirely unreal yet brimming with exquisite clarity. The sky above you seems to be cut from a single piece of shimmering gemstone, a vast expanse of turquoise that ripples like water. Deep in your chest, envy begins to smolder. It stings like a current of electricity flickering through your bones. 

In the near distance, you see someone you know—someone whose success has awakened this tangled knot of envy. They stand on a platform formed from polished marble, carved with swirling symbols that flicker and pulse with silver light. A low hum pervades the air, a sound that swirls in your ears and resonates in your heart: a reminder of your unfulfilled aspirations. 

You begin to move. At first, your feet are hesitant, nearly glued to the marble floor. It’s as though the ground itself doesn’t want you to disturb the serenity of this shimmering realm. But you press on, drawn forward by the conflicting desire to both celebrate and resent the achievement that outshines your own. Each step feels like you are crossing an invisible boundary, inching closer to the object of your envy and, at the same time, edging nearer to your own vulnerability.

As you move, lights flare into twisting shapes around you—like neon vines curling through the air, each lit with sparks of deep green for longing, stark white for truth, and glimmering gold for possibility. Through the translucent glow, you catch glimpses of memories: fragments of the late-night hours you spent practicing, the rejections you endured that left you so hungry for validation. These memories blink in and out, crisp as glass but fleeting as breath, fueling that prickly heat in your blood. 

You arrive at the platform where your friend stands. Their eyes, luminous and reassuring, flick over to you. You can almost sense the hush in the air, as though all the gilded vines and intangible energies around you lean in to listen. You want to speak but, for a moment, your voice sticks in your throat. Veins of turquoise swirl across your arms, mirroring the sky’s shade—the color of suppressed emotion. 

Trembling with unspoken words, you confront them, and your reflection in their gaze calls all your pent-up emotions to the surface. The envy you held so tightly for their success is suddenly illuminated, not as a flaw, but as a beacon showing you just how deeply you yearn to unlock your own brilliance. 

In this surreal moment, the marble platform dissolves beneath you both, and you find yourselves standing on vibrant, living ground, pulsing with your combined energies: their achievements and your aspirations weaving themselves together like roots of a magnificent tree. You feel your chest rise with a new sort of courage. Instead of letting envy bury you, you allow it to reveal what your heart truly desires. 

There, in the glimmering dreamscape, with your friend’s congratulatory smile radiating toward you, you breathe in a sense of hope. And as quickly as it began, the shimmering air wavers, the vines close in around you—and you catch the last flicker of a luminous green spark before you wake, carrying with you the quiet, powerful resolve to transform envy into fuel for your own boundless potential.
