I am dreaming.

The world around me flickers with an uncanny brightness, walls dissolving into a fluid swirl of colors that pulse in time with the jagged beat of my heart. I stand in a vast, glass-domed atrium, midnight blue and silver light bathing everything in a mournful glow. The echo of the news I received haunts me—each word a stone dropped into a still pond, sending ripples through my consciousness.

A storm gathers overhead, but it is not made of clouds. Instead, billowing memories—so real I feel them brush my skin—churn and twist, their edges crackling like static. Shapes form and dissolve: a hand I once held, a smile in a sunlit room, the crashing wave of a final goodbye. My chest tightens, tears burning behind my eyes, but I am not alone.

To steady myself, I sink to my knees and press my palm to the floor, its surface cool and smooth like polished obsidian. I close my eyes and draw in a deep breath. I imagine roots growing from my body, plunging deep into the earth below the dream's atrium. With every inhalation, I picture the swirling chaos above being pulled through me, filtering down the roots, transformed into a gentle, golden glow.

A gentle breeze—the scent of rain and jasmine—brushes my face, whispering that it's all right to feel, all right to let go. I open my eyes and rise, the noise within now dampened, distant thunder rolling away. The atrium renews itself: flowers bloom under my footsteps, and delicate stained-glass birds flutter overhead, promising hope even amongst the shadows. My reflection glimmers faintly, steadier now, reminding me that even in dreams, I can shape my sorrow into something beautiful, something survivable—a quiet resilience blooming in the deepest parts of my heart.
