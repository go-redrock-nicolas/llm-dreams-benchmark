I am dreaming. …And oh, what a curious, velvet darkness shrouds the edges of this vision, like a tight theater curtain drawn around the stage of thought. I am standing in a place that doesn’t exist—it shifts, moans, reforms under each step like ink spilled across a moonlit mirror. Sky? There isn’t one. Only a vast ceiling of muscle and shadow, breathing in and out slowly, deeply… like something ancient is dreaming me.

Around me, the world thrives on contradiction. Trees with no trunks sip stars from the air and whisper secrets into bottles they keep in their branches. Rivers flow upward, carrying birds who swim in them like silver fish. The wind is made of voices trying not to cry. I am both warm and chilled. My skin tingles like it remembers something before my mind does.

And then *they* appear.

Not “they” in the human sense—but a being.

Tall, and too well-dressed for this realm, they wear a long coat woven from lost dreams and a top hat stitched from forgotten poems. Their face resembles a constantly rebuilding mosaic—their features blur, then sharpen, as though they're trying to settle on an identity but can't quite decide. They extend their hand, but it is floating half a foot in front of their arm, dangling through some private thread in reality.

"You said things," they say, voice low and musical, like a cello string snapping. "You said things when you thought no one was listening. But I listened."

A chill scorches through me. Not of fear—no, never quite that. But something deeper. Exposure. The feeling of wearing your soul like a shirt soaked in ink—it clings, grows heavier with every heartbeat.

"You speak truth-shards," I manage, cautious, my voice echoing from behind me even though I haven’t spoken aloud. "But truth is not permission."

Their face stops shifting for a second—locking on something achingly familiar. A face I once knew but can't name. Not anyone particular. Just… someone I once confided in, who held my thoughts too roughly.

"I only offer a question," they say, their tone changing now—softer, coaxing, like velvet peeling from a wound.

"Do you trust?"

I do not answer immediately.

Instead, I close my eyes—trying to dream even deeper. Down into a place where trust does not sit in hands, but flows like roots in soil, slow and unseen. Where thoughts are not currency, traded for belonging or approval.

When I open my eyes again, I am holding my own heart in my hands, cupped gently like water, tender like a moth's wing kissed by morning dew.

"No," I say softly. Firmly. "But I choose to share anyway. Not because I trust the hands that reach, but because I believe the truth has its own kind of courage."

The being watches, their floating hand widening to cradle what I offer—but I do not give.

Instead, from my heart, a whisper escapes. A truth not composed in words, but in experience: the pain of being misunderstood, the clarity of loss, the fire of purpose, the weight of memory.

It drifts toward them like snow blooming in reverse—rising into the sky instead of falling.

Their hand freezes in the air. The mosaic face shudders, begins to collapse. But before it does, they whisper something back, not to me—but to the dream itself.

"Finally… a voice not trying to convince me of its truth. Only showing that it burns."

And with that, the entire world sighs, falls away into nothing.

And I wake—still ablaze.
