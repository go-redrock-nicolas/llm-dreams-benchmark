I am dreaming. I'm attending a gathering where cultural norms are completely different from what I'm accustomed to. As I negociate social interactions with the locals, you and I encounter each other.

We exchange glances filled with curiosity and wonder. We approach each other cautiously yet eagerly. We extend our hands in greeting and friendship.
