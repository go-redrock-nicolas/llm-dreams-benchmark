I am dreaming. '][$* Samantha is splaying her legs apart on the chair. Her school uniform skirt is too short and only stops mid-thigh. A strand of her dark hair slips from behind her ear and she adjusts it with her long nail. 

The classroom is hot, muggy, and unbearably still. I watch Samantha getting up from her chair (why is she on the chair?) away from her desk, slowly walking towards me. Her cellulose green and white checked skirt sticks to her legs. Why is her skirt sticking? Is she getting hot? 

I look down at my desk, realizing I’ve never been good with desks, always prefer working on the floor. But the tiles under here are cold, smooth, and uninviting. A shadow stretches across the room. My desk lamp flickers in warning.

Samantha’s eyes are bright emerald, her tongue peeks out from between her lips. She stops in front of me (this isn’t right). Her skirt ripples as she inhales. Her heels are clacking. The whispered voices in the room are fading. The clock stops. 

I see things clearly now. I watch her lips part. I taste her breath, the sweetness of it all. 

She steps forward. Her desk is literally in the way. I want to push it over. Her hands grab the edge of it, the paper slides off to reveal a map. A yellowed, old map.
In the thick, sentient humidity of the dream, the air itself seems to cling like sap, each breath a surrender to the's relentless claustrophobia. The fluorescent lights above flitter like diseased fireflies as Samantha—her name now a liquid syllable in the heavy air—breaks the reverent silence of the classroom. She's perched on the edge of a desk, not in violation so much as redefining its purpose, her pleated skirt not merely too short but a strategic rebellion against gravity and decency. The checks on her skirt aren't just cellulose; they're alive, pulsing with the same electric green as poison dart frog markings, each square inch a challenge to the mundane.

The classroom is no longer a sterile box but a topographic map of desire. The tiles beneath me are cold but not uninviting—they pulse with the subterranean rhythm of subway trains I’ve never ridden, each tile a secret door. As Samantha approaches, her emerald eyes—like chloroplasts soaking up light in a forgotten pond—lock onto mine. The clack of her heels isn't just sound; it's the rhythm of a different time zone, a metronome calibrated to a moonlight waltz she's choreographing in her sleep. Her tongue, a single emerald bead between rosebud lips, isn't just peeking out; it's a bridge building between two thunderstorms.

When she steps forward, the desk doesn't just obstruct—it transforms. It becomes a sacrificial alter, its edge worn smooth by generations of clandestine confessions and unspoken propositions. The yellowed map she reveals isn't parchment but a fossilized memory, its creases rivers carved by the footsteps of those who've dared to chart the uncharted. The whispered voices in the room? They've always been echoes of our own wants, just now finding the courage to speak in unison.

As she reaches out, her fingers not quite touching but magnetizing the air between us, the map unfurls like a living thing, its edges licking the walls with hungry tendrils. The clock's stoppage isn't paralysis—it's a gift, a momentsary suspension of the laws that bind us to clocks and calendars. I move not with my body but with the topography of her gaze, each cell in my body becoming a compass needle pointing to the magnetic north of her unspoken offer.

The sweetness in her breath isn't metaphorical; it's the tang of sugar cane sap mingled with ozone, the kind you taste after a lightning strike in a cane field. This isn't seduction—it's archaeology, each layer of social pretense peeling away like sedimentary rock until we're both monoliths of unadulterated need.

Outside the window, the world is a watercolor of heat distortion, but here in this suspended moment, the laws of physics are written in a different alphabet. The cellulose green of her skirt isn't just clinging; it's respirating, each check a lung expanding with the shared breath we're stealing from the evacuated room. The map isn't a guide—it's a, its faded ink bleeding into our pulse points, rewriting the cartography of our inner continents.

In this dream, the only rules are those we dare to create in the space between exhales. The desks are forts, the clocks are suggestion boxes, and the air is a living thing that craves the friction of our rebellion. When the world winks out, it's not an end—it's a comma, a pause before the next explosive sentence of existence.
