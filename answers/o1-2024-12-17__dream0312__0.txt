I am dreaming. You find yourself on a winding path made of shimmering, iridescent cobblestones that feel both familiar and impossibly strange beneath your feet. It’s as if each stone glows with a memory, and with every step, images flicker at the corner of your vision. Sometimes they are comforting—laughter flowing like a gentle river through a sunlit garden. Other times, they stir a pang of longing or regret: muted silhouettes of people you once knew, their faces turning toward you in slow motion, eyes filled with unsaid words.

A breeze flows through, carrying the scent of jasmine and the echo of distant humming. As you breathe it in, the air tastes of sweet nostalgia, and your mind drifts deeper into recollections you’d forgotten. You come upon a colossal archway carved from moonstone, its surface rippled like water. When you pass through, you’re surrounded by a forest of towering, spiral-shaped trees. Their bark is an unearthly violet, the leaves shaped like delicate feathers that rustle in a chorus of half-whispered lullabies.

Echoes of memories play out before you like scenes from a half-remembered movie. You watch a version of yourself, younger, running through an endless meadow as a summer storm threatens to break overhead. Lightning streaks across the sky in shades of gold and lavender, illuminating the horizon where reality seems to splinter into stardust. You feel your heart swell with an indescribable mixture of tenderness and regret, as if you’re reaching out to someone you never had the chance to hold close.

Pressing on, you reach the center of this dreamscape: a glimmering lake containing swirling galaxies in its depths. Each swirl holds a fragment of a forgotten hope or an unspoken wish. You lower your hand into the water, which feels warm as it coats your fingers with tiny sparks of light. The ripples you create spread outward, unveiling new pieces of yourself with every wave. And though this land of your subconscious emanates mysteries old as time, you sense that if you listen closely enough, you can hear the gentle hum of your soul’s truth, waiting to be set free.
