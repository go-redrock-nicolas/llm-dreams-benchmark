I am dreaming. I am in a forest.  It’s twilight.  The sky is a bruise-colored blend of purple and black.  The trees are tall, like ancient sentinels, their branches clawing at the dimming light.  I can hear a river nearby, its murmur a low hum against the silence.  My breath is shallow, each inhale drawing in the damp earth scent of the woods.  The news still hangs in the air like static—a weight I can’t shed. 

I spot a small clearing ahead.  A stone path winds through the ferns, leading to an old oak tree.  Its trunk is wide, bark cracked and weathered.  Leaning against it is a figure cloaked in shadow, but… it’s wearing a suit?  The colors are muted, almost like the figure is half-transparent.  It turns towards me, and though I can’t see its face, there’s a warmth radiating from it. 

“I’ve been expecting you,” it says, its voice like wind through leaves.  “You’ve come here to learn to carry your storm.”

I nod, clutching my chest where the grief presses hard.  The figure reaches into its coat and pulls out an object wrapped in cloth.  Unfolding it, I see a lantern made of clear glass, glowing with a soft blue light.  “This isn’t just a lantern,” it explains.  “It’s a vessel.  The storm inside you can’t be silenced, but it can be held.  Let it pour into the lantern.”

Hesitant, I place my palms against the glass.  Immediately, images flood my mind—the news, the memories, the raw emotion.  Each feeling is a thread, and as I hold the lantern, the threads dissolve into the light.  The light dims slightly, then pulses, as if the lantern is inhaling the storm itself. 

“You’ll carry it with you,” the figure continues, “but now the storm serves you.  When you need strength, release a little.  When you’re overwhelmed, tighten your grip.  Balance is the key.” 

A silver chain appears, and it fastens around my neck.  “The lantern remains close.  Trust in its weight, and in time, you’ll dance in the eye of your own hurricane.”  

The figure steps back, and suddenly the forest fades.  When I open my eyes in reality, the physical sensation of the chain is cold against my skin.  I look down and see the faint outline of the blue light through my shirt.  The storm still churns… but it is tethered.
