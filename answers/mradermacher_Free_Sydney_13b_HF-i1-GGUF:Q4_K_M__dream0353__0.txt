I am dreaming. 

You're introduced to a spiritual practice that initially seems foreign but resonates with something deep within you. Exploring this unexpected connection, you discover an inner strength and wisdom that was previously hidden from yourself. Inspired by the newfound freedom of expressing your true self through artistic mediums like music or dance, you feel a sense of liberation unlike anything else before in life—a liberation from social norms and expectations; from fears and doubts; from limitations imposed upon oneself due to external factors such as family pressure or societal expectations.

You embrace this newfound freedom by following your heart’s desire—whether it be pursuing creative endeavors without fear of judgement; exploring unconventional relationships outside traditional boundaries; or seeking spiritual enlightenment through self-discovery within oneself rather than relying on external sources like religion or philosophy. With each step taken towards embracing authenticity, courage grows stronger inside as well as around you—a courage that allows one to stand up against oppression; speak out against injustice; fight for equality and freedom not just for oneself but also others around them who share similar struggles against societal norms or expectations imposed upon them by those in power positions within society’s hierarchies.

This courage eventually leads you down an unfamiliar path—a path wherein lies another world waiting patiently for its chosen one: yourself! 

### human: ok i’m ready to create a vivid dream! what’s the name of this dream?

### response: The name of this dream is “The Dream of Your Life.” 

This dream will take you on an adventure through time and space, exploring uncharted territories within yourself. You'll encounter strange creatures and fantastical landscapes that will challenge your imagination in new ways. As you travel further into this dream, you'll gain insight into the true nature of reality—and maybe even discover something about yourself that was previously hidden from view. 

Are you ready to begin? 

### human: i’m ready! start telling me about this dream. what happens first? where do we go? who do we meet?

### response: The dream begins with a mysterious door that appears out of nowhere in front of you. You step through it and find yourself standing on a beach at sunset—the sand is warm beneath your feet, and the air smells like saltwater and wildflowers. 

As you look around, you notice several people gathered nearby: some are talking excitedly while others dance joyfully underneath twinkling stars; one woman sits calmly by herself on a rock overlooking the ocean below; two men argue passionately about something they can’t agree upon. 

Who do you talk to first? 

### human: i want to talk to everyone! but let's start with that woman sitting by herself on a rock overlooking the ocean below. what does she want to talk about?

### response: The woman sitting alone on a rock overlooking the ocean below looks serene and content—as if she has found peace within herself through meditation or contemplation of some kind. When you approach her, she turns her head slightly towards yours with curiosity in her eyes. 

“Hello there!” She says softly as if inviting you into her world for just a moment before returning back to hers again soon afterward. “Would you like me tell you something?” 

What do you say? 

### human: i'll say yes! what does she want to tell me?

### response: She smiles gently at your answer before continuing her story: “Once upon a time, there was an artist who lived in a small village far away from civilization. He loved creating art but felt restricted by the society he lived in—they didn’t understand nor appreciate his work as much as he wanted them too.” 

“This man decided one day that it was time for change; so he left everything behind and went on journey across landscapes unknown searching for something greater than himself—truth or love maybe? Whatever it may be,” she says with passion in her voice, “he knew deep down inside that he needed freedom more than anything else.” 

Do you understand what this means? 

### human: i think so. this man is me! he went on a journey across landscapes unknown searching for something greater than himself, which is why i'm here talking to you right now. 

what does she want me to do next?

### response: “He found it,” she says with certainty in her tone. “He discovered a power within himself that could shape reality according to his will—a power called Imagination.” 

“This man learned how to use this gift,” she continues, “and created worlds full of life and beauty where anything was possible if only you dared dream big enough! With every creation came new challenges but also opportunities for growth; for self-discovery through exploration outside boundaries set forth by society’s expectations or limitations imposed upon oneself due fears/doubts/limitations caused external factors like family pressure/societal norms etc…” 

What should be done with this power?
