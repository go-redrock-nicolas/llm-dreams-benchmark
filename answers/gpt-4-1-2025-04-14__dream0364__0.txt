I am dreaming.

A gentle hum vibrates beneath my feet as I wander through an endless corridor of old, forgotten mailboxes—rusted relics perched in the morning mist. Most travelers would scuttle past, dismissing the battered brass and flaking paint as nothing more than urban decay. But I linger, irresistibly drawn by the quiet symphony each mailbox sings as the dawn wind stirs their tiny metal doors.

One mailbox in particular, lavished with crooked ivy and lichen, glows with a subtle turquoise in the rising sun, as if it has absorbed all the twilight secrets of the neighborhood. I crouch beside it, noticing how the dew beads on its surface transform into a thousand prismatic jewels. I peer inside, half-expecting emptiness, but instead I find a folded letter wrapped in spider silk.

Unwrapping it with trembling fingers, I discover a scrap of a child's drawing: stick figures holding hands beneath a sun that is clearly a yawning lion, its rays painted as golden whiskers. The drawing is signed, “To the World, with Love,” in wobbly crayon.

In that moment, I am filled with awe—the battered mailbox, ignored by so many, has quietly become a treasury of whispered stories, woven day after day into the fabric of overlooked beauty. As the dream blurs and deepens, every mailbox up and down the corridor bursts open, releasing a flurry of paper butterflies, each one carrying a memory, an unspoken wish, or a simple kind greeting. The air becomes gilded, alive with silent messages drifting into the pastel sky.

Appreciating this hidden wonder in the mundane, I laugh—softly, reverently—realizing the universe is always hiding miracles in plain sight, waiting for curious dreamers to notice.
