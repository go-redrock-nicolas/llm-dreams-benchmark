I am dreaming. At first, the world around me is a blur, shapes melting at the edges like watercolor left in the rain. Then, slowly, everything sharpens, and I find myself standing at the threshold of an enormous labyrinth—walls taller than redwoods, woven from twisting vines heavy with iridescent blossoms that hum softly, as if whispering secrets to one another. The air is thick with the scent of something like honey and crushed mint, rich and dizzying.  

A path stretches before me, cobbled in shimmering stones that shift color beneath my feet—amber, then sapphire, then a deep, luminous green. Part of me tenses, convinced that this is a trap, that the flowers are poisonous, that the labyrinth will tighten around me like a snake’s coils if I take another step. But then I hesitate.  

*Why do I assume the worst?*  

The humming blossoms sound more like laughter than a threat now. The shifting stones feel playful, not treacherous. I take a deep breath and step forward—this time not bracing for danger, but open to wonder. The walls rustle as I pass, not menacingly but curiously, as if they too are watching, learning.  

A soft glow pulses ahead, gold bleeding into rose, and suddenly I’m at a clearing where a great tree stands, its trunk woven from countless strands of light. Its roots clutch not dirt but galaxies—tiny swirling constellations pulsing beneath the surface. Before I can question whether it will burn me, it *sings—* a sound like wind chimes made of stars. And the fear unravels.  

I wake with the echo of that song in my chest, the taste of nectar on my tongue, and the startling realization: *What if my mind has been a labyrinth of shadows by choice? What if I could choose light instead?*
