I am dreaming. But as I speak, what I am trying to say is recognized, grasped. However the understanding is not as it should be. There is a twist. I say a word and hear back its ripple, but the ripple is not my own, it is not my voice. I close my eyes to feel the currents of my thoughts, backtracking to a moment where the word was pure, untampered by what lies beyond. 

"It's not that they don't get it," I realize as the scene around me changes, “It's that I can feel it, deeper than I could ever explain.” 

I am sitting on the edge of an endless body of water, its horizon obscured by fog. A breeze gently stirs, carrying the faint sound of music. The melody is familiar, but I can't place it. It feels woven into the fabric of the dream itself. Right here, right now, this is the place of pure expression I’ve been searching for. This exact moment. I am on the verge of saying something profound, realizing an emotion I have never been able to express until now. I close my eyes. 

"If only I could remember it long enough to write it down," I say to no one in particular, though I feel as if I'm explaining this to someone, a figure just out of sight. And yet, as I speak the words, I know that they’re inadequate. They’re just words. The real thing—that something that should be grasped but is just out of reach—it lies in the ineffable space between the notes of that music. In the feeling that lingers after the melody fades. 

I open my eyes, and I am no longer by the water. I’m in a dimly lit room, illuminated only by the soft, blue light of an old television set. On the screen, I see myself as a child, playing in a park. My younger self doesn’t notice me. He’s too busy running, chasing a butterfly. I want to speak to him, to somehow communicate with that version of myself. I want to tell him to stop running. I want to tell him about this moment, this understanding. 

"Do you even know what you're after?" I ask, but he doesn’t hear me. He’s too young to understand, and as I watch him disappear into a swirl of colors, I realize I don’t want him to. 

The dream shifts again. I am in a library. The shelves stretch infinitely upward, disappearing into shadow. I know, somehow, that every book on these shelves is a piece of me. Each a fragment of thought, a shard of memory, a piece of a conversation that I have either had or wish I could have. 

I pull one from the shelf. It is bound in black leather, the title obscured by intricate patterns etched into the cover. I open it, expecting words, but instead, there is only music. The same melody from before. Each note is written in a language I have never seen, but somehow know. It strikes me, then, that this is the very language I have been seeking. The language of feeling, of unspoken understanding. 

And then I wake, but the dream stays with me. It lingers in my fingers, in my chest, in the corners of my mind where I keep things that are precious. It was not just a dream, I realize. It was a reminder. 

A reminder to keep chasing that butterfly, even if I can’t quite catch it. 

Even if I were a butterfly myself, I would never want to stop.
