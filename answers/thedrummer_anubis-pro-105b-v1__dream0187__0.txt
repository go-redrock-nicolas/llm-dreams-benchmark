I am dreaming. I'm responsible for a safety system where absolute perfection is required to prevent disaster. When anomalies begin appearing in my previously flawless protocols, I know something is terribly wrong.

In the dream, I'm standing alone in a dimly lit control room, surrounded by banks of flickering computer screens and whirring machinery. The walls are cold, grey concrete and the air smells of ozone and burning wire. 

I'm staring at one particularly malfunctioning screen through the drizzle of sweat that's running down my face. It's like a ship's navigation chart, warning us of impending doom. The lines that used to be straight and even, now squiggle across the screen in all directions, like a child's crayon scribbles. 

Suddenly, my phone rings. It's the voice on the other end and opposite drip of the receiver. "The.Sleepo." It says. The ship is in danger of rupturing and erupting from its initial state. It needs to be put to rest immediately.
