I am dreaming. You find yourself drifting through a moonlit boulevard of iridescent balloons and lanterns, each one humming with its own soft melody. The air smells of warm cinnamon and damp moss, and beneath your feet the cobblestones ripple like gentle waves. All around you, the city’s colors shift—jade to rose to periwinkle—like a living watercolor.  

Ahead, you spot someone you love walking beneath an arch of rose-gold vines. They wear a bright sunflower mask, its petals gleaming with laughter. But as you draw closer, you sense a tremble in their shoulders, a subtle discord in the sunflower’s gleam. In the hush between streetlamps, you realize: behind that cheerful facade there is something unspoken, a weight they carry alone.  

You pause, heart softening. The crowd’s music swells and recedes, and for a moment the world narrows to just the two of you. You don’t ask them to explain. Instead, you lift your hand—light as moonlight—and place it gently on the sunflower’s edge. The mask trembles; a single petal cracks, revealing a sliver of pale longing beneath.  

In that quiet space, you offer only this: your presence. No questions. No demands. Your steady breath becomes a silent promise that you will stay, that you see them as they are. The sunflower’s glow flickers, then steadies, softer now, more honest.  

As you both stand under the rose-gold arch, the lanterns above rain tiny sparks of light, like understanding falling into your shared silence. Then the dream begins to dissolve—the balloons drift away, the cobblestones smooth out, the scent of cinnamon lingers one last time.  

You wake with a gentle warmth in your chest, carrying the unspoken bond of attention and care into the waking world.
