I am dreaming. …pull the whole dreamscape into crystalline stillness.

A heartbeat ago you were poised to lash out—fists tightening, throat hot with words sharp as broken glass—because the silver-masked figure before you had just shattered the luminous globe you’d been guarding. Shards of violet light still spin in slow motion around the mask’s empty eye-slits. Every nerve insists that you strike, shout, do something.  

But then the impossible hush arrives.  
Time folds in on itself like origami, and you notice—really notice—the space between impulse and action. It’s no thicker than a dragonfly’s wing, yet inside it yawns a cathedral of awareness.

You slip into that slender sanctuary.

First you hear your own pulse echoing through endless vaulted chambers.  
Second you feel the heat of anger swirling through your torso, not a wildfire after all but a red river, molten and alive.  
Third you realize you’re lucid: you are the dreamer and the dreamed. Within this pause, you can rewrite everything.

So you breathe.

In through the soles of your feet, where bioluminescent moss glows turquoise.  
Out through the crown of your skull, releasing a plume of gold dust that settles over the frozen tableau.

As your breath slows, colors return to their original speed. The suspended shards melt into droplets of amethyst rain, chiming softly as they touch the indigo marble floor. The silver-masked figure’s posture softens; its shoulders sag as though it, too, is tired of the violence written into so many stories.

A question surfaces, luminous and fragile: “What does the globe actually represent?”  
You look inward and see it is your sense of worth, your right to shine. The mask didn’t destroy it—only revealed its impermanence.

Compassion wells up in your chest like a warm spring.

You step forward, place a hand on the figure’s metallic cheek. The mask ripples, liquefies, and drips away to reveal…your own face, younger and frightened. The child-you looks up, expecting punishment, but you simply hug them. The embrace fuses the two of you into one radiant being, stitched together by threads of lilac light.

Around you, the cathedral transforms: pillars become willow trees, marble becomes grass, the ceiling opens onto a midnight sky ablaze with constellations that pulse in time with your breathing. The remnants of the shattered globe swirl upward, converging into a new sphere—bigger, brighter, pulsating with every color you’ve ever loved. It hovers above your palms like a tame sun.

You realize the triggering moment has become a seed of insight: that between stimulus and response lives infinite choice, and in that infinity you can sculpt galaxies, heal old fractures, or simply rest in the stillness.

A slow smile spreads across the cosmos.  
You exhale one last time, and the dream unfurls into dawn.
