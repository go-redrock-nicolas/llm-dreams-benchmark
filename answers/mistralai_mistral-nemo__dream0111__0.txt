I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the most peculiar operating theater. The walls, ceiling, and floor are not the cold, sterile white I've come to expect from such places, but rather, they're alive with a kaleidoscope of colors, shifting and dancing like an aurora's embraced the entire room. The air is filled with a symphony of soft, LED hums and the distant, rhythmic pounding of a heart, pulsating from unseen speakers, echoing the lifeline that lies before me.

In this dream-theater, the table isn't a clinical slab of metal, but an enormous, writhing tree trunk, its gnarled roots stretching out like veins, branching out beneath the bright, ethereal glow of what seems like an entire galaxy compressed into a chandelier, casting its milky, cosmic light upon the scene.

My reflection is warped and distorted in the gleaming surface of the table, my features elongated, eyes wide with anxiety and determination. Yet, in this distorted mirror image, I see not fear etched into my face, but an eerie calm, a serene focus I can only hope to mimic in reality.

The patient lies before me, not a person, but a creature from the deep, its body a delicate, translucent clustered of nerite seashells. Each shell is a tiny, perfect nautilus curve, grey as a stormy sea, pulsating with light, pulsating with life. It's not a body, but a city, a metropolis of delicate, interconnected alveoli, a complexity that in any other context would be beautiful, breathtaking, but now, it's a labyrinth of fear, a challenge I'm not sure I'm equipped to face.

My hands, once firm and steady, now tremble as I grasp the scalpel. Not a cold, steel blade, but a hummingbird's beak, delicate and precise, vibrating with energy. It's a living tool, pulsating in rhythm with the city before me, as if the universe itself is guiding my hand. The blade, if you can call it that, is a shimmering cascade of liquid light, a rainbow prism refracting the chandelier's cosmic glow.

The time for hesitation is over. The hummingbird's beak begins to throb, its vibrations intensifying, its song growing louder, more insistent. It's as if the tool itself is urging me on, pushing me towards the precipice of doubt and into the abyss of action.

I take a deep breath, filling my lungs with the cool, electric air, and guide the blade towards the first shell. The room holds its breath, the universe pauses, and in this moment of crystalline silence, I cut.
