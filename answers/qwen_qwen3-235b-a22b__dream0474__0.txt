I am dreaming. The night is not dark, but laced with pale, shifting veils of violet and jade light—like auroras watching over a sleeping world. I find myself standing barefoot on a shore not made of sand or stone, but of moonlight woven into grains that sing softly with each step. A strange warmth moves through the air, like whispered lullabies in a tongue I’ve never learned but somehow understand. It’s not my language—yet it fills the spaces behind my ribs like an ancestral echo.

I look around, and realize I am not alone.

A procession approaches from the heart of a forest that seems to breathe. Towering trees hum in their roots, and their leaves are like stained glass in a cathedral of nature—shifting color and reflecting sights not of this world. From the canopy, lights drift down like constellation embers, and in their descent, form figures—tall, wrapped in flowing sashes that shimmer with the sheen of river water and flame. These are not people like me. Their faces bear the calm solemnity of ancient rites, and their eyes glow faintly with a light that seems to pierce time.

I am drawn toward them without moving, and the landscape rearranges itself—as dreams do—with impossible grace. Monolithic stones rise like sleeping giants in a spiral circle around us. Symbols carve themselves into air and earth, looping ideograms of syllabics and glyphs that pull meaning from the marrow of memory.

I am wrapped in cloth that smells of cedar and incense. My reflection, moonlit and liquid in a nearby pool, shows me not as myself, but as part of this ancient reverie—face lined with sacred ash, hair adorned with feathers and beads that vibrate faintly when the drums begin.

Their voices start low, then rise in layered waves—polyphonic, pulsing drumbeats and wooden windpipes that call across eons. I sense this is not a performance, but a remembrance—a ritual that predates any written history. It is not mine. It is wildly unfamiliar in pattern and shape, yet every pulse feels like it's choreographed within my DNA. Each symbol they paint into the air with their hands, each posture struck, wakes something in me—not from my limited life, but from something older.

I move. My body knows the rhythm before my mind does. There is no dissonance, only integration. I dance where I have never danced, howl syllables I've never uttered, and cry tears that are sweet with the taste of fire and sorrow.

The ground moves beneath us, spiraling with our steps, revealing beneath the soil an immense longhouse adorned with golden vines and celestial faces—watchers of old lines and landscapes. Inside, a fire burns without smoke. Around it, memory visions bloom like midnight jasmine—children playing beside rivers once thought barren, ancestors laughing and weeping, wars avoided and sung into being as echoes of possibility.

I feel my presence here is not accident, but invitation.

And yet, I know deeply—I am not a part of this culture by birth. I have never walked its soil, sung its babies to sleep, or named my pain with its stories. But in this dream, I am a student made vessel. I am allowed to feel the resonance of a lineage not bound by blood, but by rhythm—by shared breath across time, by the universal aching for meaning, for memory, for marvel.

It is a forgotten connection made new. Not appropriation, not mimicry, but *resonance*—a shared pulse thrumming across the heartstrings of different continents, different histories, bound in a moment by nothing less than love.

And in that space, something shifts within me. A deeper reverence is born—not for the "foreign", but for the interwoven. For the ways in which even the farthest shores reflect the same moon.

Then the light narrows. The figures blur into fog. The beating slows. I wake, with the marrow of an unknown fire etched deep into my bones. The dream remains. I guard it like sacred firewood—knowing it must not be stolen from its source, but carried back, honored, and never forgotten.
