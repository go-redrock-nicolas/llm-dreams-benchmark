I am dreaming. ../

I find myself standing at the threshold of an ancient library that seems to float among iridescent clouds, its countless stories stretching infinitely in all directions. The bookshelves are made of living wood that pulses with a gentle, amber luminescence.

The dream begins to fade, but the sensation of purpose remains, etched into my being like stardust settled on skin. The library's whispers follow me into waking, reminding me that every choice, every moment, is part of an ever-unfolding story...
