I am dreaming. The air in the command center hums with a metallic tang, like the aftertaste of a lightning strike. Sleek holographic interfaces flicker around you, casting prismatic halos on the faces of the twelve specialists assembled—geniuses in fields you can’t pronounce, their eyes sharp enough to flay you alive. Your new uniform itches, a high-tech fabric that seems to throb in time with the pulsing crimson alert on the main screen. Its glow outlines the crisis: an alien artifact, unearthed in the Arctic permafrost, now levitating above the ice like a shattered black moon, emitting a low-frequency tone that’s unspooling reality itself.

Dr. Veyra, the quantum cryptolinguist, leans forward, her voice honeyed venom. “Your *plan*, Commander?” The last word drips with irony. The others freeze, scalpels paused over data tablets. You feel the dream-logic now—strange confidence flooding your veins, as if the artifact’s hum has rewired your synapses. You step toward the hologram, finger tracing a fracture in the artifact’s impossible geometry. “We don’t decode its language,” you hear yourself say. “We *answer* it. Not with equations. With this.” You tap your temple. The room prickles with disbelief. Yet when you turn, the glacier on-screen is already blooming into crystalline flora, obeying some unseen command. The team stares. You’re improvising an opera in a language you’ve never spoken, but the ice sings back—and suddenly, neither you nor the dream care which is the conductor.
