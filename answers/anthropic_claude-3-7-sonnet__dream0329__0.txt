I am dreaming. I stand at the threshold of a massive library that stretches beyond comprehension, shelves rising impossibly high into a ceiling of swirling nebulae and distant stars. Each book contains a decision—some made, some unmade—their spines glowing with varying intensities of blue and amber light. The air smells of old paper and something else... possibility.

A weathered librarian with eyes that shift between silver and gold approaches me. Her name badge changes each time I blink: "Authority," "Conscience," "Tradition," "Justice."

"You must choose," she whispers, her voice like autumn leaves skittering across stone.

Before me appear two paths through the stacks. One is straight, well-lit, meticulously maintained—each volume perfectly aligned, every step clearly marked with the comforting weight of precedent and protocol. A golden thread runs along this path, unbroken and reassuring.

The second path winds unpredictably between the shelves, dimly illuminated by the glow of books that seem to pulse with urgency. This path is overgrown with vines that bear both thorns and luminescent flowers that whisper contradicting advice as I pass. The air here feels electric with potential and danger.

In my hands materializes a key—neither fully solid nor entirely ephemeral. I understand instinctively that it will unlock a restricted section containing information that could save many but violates the sacred order of this place.

The ground trembles beneath my feet as distant clock chimes reverberate. The decision cannot wait, yet both choices leave something precious behind.

I feel the weight of countless unseen eyes watching my choice—some encouraging rebellion, others silently pleading for adherence to the rules that maintain this delicate universe of knowledge.

What will I choose when both rightness and wrongness wear each other's clothes?
