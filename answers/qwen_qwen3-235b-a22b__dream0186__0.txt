I am dreaming. The air is thick, humid, electric with possibility—the kind of dream that feels less like a vision and more like vulnerability made manifest. I’m standing in a field of liquid amber and obsidian gravel, beneath twin moons that bleed violet light across a sky stitched together with constellations that pulse like live wires. My creation lies before me—an enormous sculpture woven from shards of my childhood, from memories I buried deep in the marrow of my bones. It’s alive. It breathes.

The sculpture—my art, my confession—respires with a glowing core: a luminous heart cut from copper and woven from my own fraught laughter, my mother’s voice, the hot breath of fear after a first kiss, the taste of failure so sharp it made my eyes water, the one moment I knew I mattered.

A great crowd moves forward. Specters in black robes, eyed with lightning, mouths like razored hymns—they are the Critics. Not ordinary critics of art or fiction, but judges of the soul, the type that lurk in the folds of your unconscious, whispering in the echoing corridors behind your eyelids.

They circle the sculpture with glacial movement, fingers twitching. Then, like violins tuning for something inevitable and dire, they begin.

“She lacked craft,” says the tallest, who has eyes like frozen mirrors. “All feelings, no form.”

"There is nothing new here," murmurs another. “This has all been said before, better, by others.”

"Stale. Pretentious. Self-indulgent. Revealing only weakness."

Their voices become cicadas. A high, shrilling pitch of condemnation that drowns out the breathing of my creation. The heart flickers.

I bend inward, knees weakening beneath the weight of my own dishonor. In the dream, shame is a flood—a thick, cloying oil that coats the back of the throat, corrodes the soul. I want to weep, to hide, to withdraw into the silence that told me for years to never say anything at all. To never offer up this part of me. Never open the ribcage and show the raw quiver of beating heart.

But something shifts.

A tremor beneath my feet. The obsidian gravel splits open like fragile eggshell, and from it rises roots—living roots, pulpy and luminous—that reach hungrily toward the sculpture. They slither into its ribs of memory, each tendril transferring something primal, something alive.

Then—like an exorcism—the heart reignites. Not with rage but with an aching, defiant *truth*. I begin to understand: the Critics are real, but so too is the core of this thing I've made. Real enough to burn through the fog of dissection. Real enough to change it.

The Critics recoil. They shriek, their voices dissolving into the humid air, and one by one their forms fracture into fog and gold dust, like old gods tired of exacting worship.

Then silence falls.

The sculpture stands tall now—bathed in the violet light of the twin moons, its surface worn but glowing, like a canyon wall etched with centuries of wind and whisper.  
And I—still tender from the exposure, still barefoot in the dream—I stand behind it, eyes heavy with ancient knowledge.

They called it weak.  
So was the seed before the forest.  
So was the tear before the ocean.

And in dreams, weakness can be holy. Vulnerability divine.

I wake up trembling.  
But not from fear.  
From freedom.
