I am dreaming. I am in a world where everything is possible.   I can fly like an eagle, swim like a dolphin, run like a cheetah.    I can talk to animals, plants, rocks.   I can create beautiful art with my mind.   I can solve complex problems with my intuition.    I can explore unknown territories with my curiosity. 

I am surrounded by stunning landscapes and colorful sceneries.  The sky is full of stars, constellations, shooting stars.   The sea is full of waves, ripples, bubbles.   The land is full of mountains, valleys, rivers.   

I hear the sounds of nature: birds chirping, insects humming, water flowing, wind blowing.    I smell the scents of nature: flowers blooming, grass growing, trees shedding leaves.   I taste the flavors of nature: fruits ripening, vegetables cooking, spices seasoning.  

I see the sights of nature: sunrises, sunsets, moonlight, starlight.   I feel the sensations of nature: warmth, coolness, pain, pleasure. 

I am alive in this dream world.  I am free in this dream world.  I am happy in this dream world. 

What do you want me to do?
