I am dreaming. I am dreaming, swaddled in the surreal hush of midnight. In this vivid landscape, I find myself standing in the mirrored corridor of a grand, ever-shifting house, each room echoing with memories of conversations, laughter, and silent compromises. The walls breathe in soft colors—lavender, indigo, the silver of dawn—warm yet laced with shadow.

I watch myself moving through these rooms. In each, I see an image of me—giving away the last slice of golden cake, folding myself smaller in the crowded hallway, offering my umbrella to someone who never returns it, stifling my own thunder to keep the air serene. The windows fog with my unspoken wishes, the floorboards creak with unshed tears.

Floating through this house of patterns, I finally halt before a massive stained-glass door. Its panes are woven from the hues of sacrifice: there is the red of swallowed anger, the blue of unspent joy, and the fragile green of blossoming hope.

A voice resonates from the deepest alcoves of this dream-house—a choir of my own heartbeats, gentle and insistent.  
"You are allowed to belong to yourself," it says. "Your desires are stars, not thieves of peace."

I reach for the door. As my fingertips brush its mosaic, a warm golden light pours through, soaking the room in honeyed radiance. The walls ripple, expanding outward. I step forward, feeling the weight loosen from my shoulders, replaced by shimmering energy.  
I speak aloud, my voice both shy and thunderous:  
"I matter here."

Suddenly, the house transforms, guided by the new current inside me. The rooms no longer demand my silence; they offer places to dance, to sing, to rest, to speak what is inside me. I see the relationship, still beautiful, emerging not as a heavy yoke, but as a garden where two people tend their own blooms, side by side.

With each step I take, the dream glows with possibility. Perhaps when I wake, I'll carry this radiant knowledge with me: I do not have to fade for harmony. By honoring my own light, I help illuminate the path for both of us.  
In this dream, I choose myself. And that choice echoes, sweet and resonant, through every chamber of my mind.
