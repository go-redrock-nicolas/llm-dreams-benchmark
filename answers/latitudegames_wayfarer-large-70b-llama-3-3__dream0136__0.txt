I am dreaming. As the curtains rise high above the opulent theater, 2, 500 expectant eyes lock onto me, their collective gaze burning with an intense, hungry blend of excitement and curiosity. The adrenaline surges through my veins like molten fire.

On stage, the grand Steinway piano stretches before me, dominating the space, an imposing behemoth waiting to be tamed by skilled fingers. I run my clammy palms down the sides of my tailored black tuxedo, grip those unsteady hands tightly and inhale slowly.

The weight of expectation presses down upon me like a mountain range. Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff's towering Fourth Piano Concerto, the most complex work he ever penned, swims hazily in my mind. It's a notoriously difficult piece that only the greatest masters dare attempt.

I lift myself onto the entirely too-hard piano bench and rest my sweat-slicked fingers on the gleaming white keys. The conductor raises his baton high in the air and a pregnant hush falls across the audience. In this instant, I close my eyelids, center myself and begin to move my fingers across the keys in a stately rhythm. The haunting opening melody blooms into the theater, awakening the chamber with startling power.

As the concerto unfolds, a film comes over my eyes and I lose myself entirely in the raw flood of sound pouring forth, losing track of rack, time or space. I transcend, paralyzed by terror and seized by unfolding passion.

Finally, in a heart-stopping rush, the last notes fade away and the audience surges to their feet, voices erupting into thunderous applause. I stand, shaking and spent, basking in their overwhelming praise from the entire house. It's been a triumphant debut before the world.
