I am dreaming. I'm sitting at my desk, but it's not quite my desk anymore. The wooden surface begins to ripple like disturbed water, and my computer monitor stretches impossibly tall, reaching toward a ceiling that seems to recede into infinity. The project files scattered across my desk transform into living, breathing creatures - origami birds made of deadline notices that flutter anxiously around my head, their paper wings whisking past my ears with urgent whispers of "due dates" and "deliverables."

My supervisor approaches, but she's walking on the walls, defying gravity, her business suit flowing like liquid mercury. As she speaks, her words materialize as glowing butterflies that land on my shoulders, each one adding crushing weight. The fourth project she hands me isn't a folder or a file - it's a pulsing, crystalline sphere that hums with an ominous frequency.

The office around me begins to fold in on itself like a complex piece of architectural origami. My coworkers' desks spiral into a MÃ¶bius strip of endless workstations, where everyone's typing on keyboards made of flowing water. The deadline calendar on the wall bleeds its numbers, red digits dripping down to form a pool at my feet, and I realize I'm now standing on a surface of floating timestamps, each one ticking away with increasing urgency.

The three existing projects have manifested as three different versions of myself, each one frantically working at a different corner of this impossible space. They look at me with exhausted, pleading eyes as they juggle cascading spreadsheets and shower of endless emails that burst into tiny fireworks when they collide.

The crystalline sphere of the fourth project pulses stronger now, its light synchronizing with my heartbeat. As I reach out to touch it, my fingers pass through its surface like mercury, and I feel the weight of time itself pressing against my consciousness. The walls of the office have become transparent, revealing an infinite landscape of deadlines stretching to the horizon, each one a ticking clock tower in a surreal cityscape of responsibility.

I try to speak, but my words emerge as colorful equations that float away, solving themselves in mid-air. The pressure builds as the origami birds, glowing butterflies, and time-stamps swirl faster and faster around me in a tornado of tasks, until...

The dream begins to fade, but the weight of those four projects lingers like phantom limbs, their deadlines echoing in the space between sleep and wakefulness.
