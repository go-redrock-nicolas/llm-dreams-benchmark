I am dreaming. You are standing at the edge of the universe staring out into the endless abyss. A strange mist surrounds you and a feeling of dread creeps up your spine. Slowly, a figure emerges from the mist, a tall, dark shadow envelops your vision and a faint voice echoes out "You are not alone". 
As the mist clears, you find yourself standing in a field of flowers, the sun warming your skin and the gentle breeze brushing through your hair. A child runs up to you holding a bouquet of flowers, laughing and smiling.
You feel a sense of peace wash over you, and the world fades away into the mist once again. You wake up feeling refreshed and renewed.
