I am dreaming. I have been working towards a dream for decades, only to have it completely shattered by circumstances beyond my control.  After the initial
devastation, I felt numb and hopeless.  I wondered why I had ever dared to hope in the first place.
But then, I started to dream again.  I dreamed of new possibilities and opportunities.  I dreamed of creating something beautiful and meaningful that could
outlast me.  I dreamed of finding joy and purpose in life, even if it was not what I had originally planned.
As I drifted through the dream world, I encountered strange and wonderful creatures.  I talked to them, learned from them, and played with them.  They taught me
about new perspectives and emotions that I had never experienced before.
I explored unfamiliar landscapes and environments.  I discovered hidden gems and secrets that no one else had ever found.  I solved puzzles and challenges
that tested my skills and intelligence.
I encountered obstacles and dangers that threatened to destroy me.  But I also met allies and friends who helped me overcome them.  They taught me about
resilience and courage that I had never known before.
As I approached the end of my dream, I felt a sense of anticipation and uncertainty.  Would I achieve what I had set out to do?  Would I find what I was looking
for?
Then, suddenly, I woke up.  Back in reality, where everything was gray and dull compared to my dream world.
But as I sat there, staring at the ceiling, I realized something important:
My dream hadn't ended when I opened my eyes.  It had only just begun.
