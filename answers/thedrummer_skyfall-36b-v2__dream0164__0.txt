I am dreaming. You find yourself lying on a dewy grass in an open field that stretches out as far as your eyes can see, a canvas of vivid green. The sun shines brightly, casting an amber glow across the landscape while a gentle breeze caresses your skin. You take a deep breath, the crisp air filling your lungs with a renewed vitality.

Suddenly, an immense surge of energy courses through your body, originating from deep within your mind. Instantly, you realize you possess an incredible power - the ability to transmute elements and materials with mere thought. Excitement and wonder fill you as you sit up, eager to explore the farthest reaches of this newfound ability.

You close your eyes and focus, visualizing the blade of grass nearest to your fingertips. In your mind's eye, the intricate structure of the cell walls appears, and with a subtle shift in your consciousness while picturing energy in the form of the metal gold, you feel the grass morphing. You open your eyes, startled to find yourself holding a lustrous, perfectly formed golden blade in your hand. Overjoyed beyond measure, you jump to your feet ready for more. 

Experimenting further, you reach down and scoop up a handful of soil. Focusing intently while envisioning the structure of the clearest diamond, you feel the dense earth between your fingers transform into the gemstone. The dirt crumbles away, leaving behind a flawless, radiant crystal sparkling in the sunlight. A knowing smile spreads across your face.

Spotting a jagged boulder in the distance, you stride purposefully towards it, reveling in the supple earth beneath your bare feet. You lay your hand gently upon the rough surface and envision molding it into a work of art. Closing your eyes, you feel the boulder yielding to your will, reshaping itself into a beautiful sculpture of a soaring eagle.

Drunk on the ecstasy of creation at your fingertips, your mind conjures up fantastical visions of what else you could create, modify or transmute at will. The boundaries of what is possible seem to disappear like wisps of morning fog, leaving you abuzz with anticipation of the wonders awaiting you.

Suddenly, the tranquil silence of the field is shattered as you hear a deep, thunderous roar in the distance. Opening your eyes, you realize that your carefree meddling has unintentionally awakened an ancient guardian slumbering just beneath the surface. The earth trembles as a massive, serpentine creature emerges, its scaled body glistening an obsidian black. Swimming through the once peaceful field is a now agitated giant earthworm the size of a dragon, with eyes burning crimson.

You leap back, your heart racing with a fusion of trepidation and exhilaration. This creature, born of your wild imagination and now very real, coils around you in a suffocating embrace. You struggle against its might, but it is useless. The creature lifts you high into the air as if holding a tiny plaything between its fingers.

As you swim through the nightmare you've unintentionally birthed, you are struck by a startling epiphany. Perhaps your raw power, while incredible, also holds an inherent danger... a risk of chaos if misused. The worm's grip tightens, nearly crushing you between its mighty appendages, as if to drive this lesson home. Without warning, it opens its jaws wide, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth, preparing to devour you whole.

Panic surges through your veins and you draw upon your powers. The worm's flesh yields to your imagination, morphing from crushing death-trap into soft silk as its jaws engulf you. Enveloped in tight but bearable embrace of its tongue, you feel a perverse sense of comfort, a strange momentary safety like a mother's womb. But within the worm, the worms stomach roils with freshet, churning and bubbling with an unfathomable force, threatening at any moment to rend you apart or dissolve you... 

Aware you are on the precipice of waking from this acute nightmare that you've conjured but also fearing the end of this strangely captivating metaphor. The worm tightens its keeping you in a continual struggle to experience both the surging feeling of being so close to waking and still fully aware that you're in a dream. The worms slithering scales caress you as you squeeze past a narrow throat and make your way to the empty center of its body. Around you millions of scaly bodies slither to devour you. 

Yet in the center of all this conflict you find yourself seated a table dressed beautifully. The worm has exploded into a fabulous dinner party. Your in dream mother, brother, sister and grandmother await. Your bother grabs you with laughter and asks "What took so long we started without you!" as he shovels neck bone, giggly worms into his mouth.

You awaken breathlessly in a bath as if returning from a deeply anonymous dream. The colors seem brighter the sound seem more full. And you know that even now only awake for moments everything will always feel different and you cannot ignore the vivdness it all carries and how different it feels when you dream. You lay in the bath started and walow in the subliminal possibilitys that even now you feel like a dreamer and there is still so much to struggle with and wonder at.
