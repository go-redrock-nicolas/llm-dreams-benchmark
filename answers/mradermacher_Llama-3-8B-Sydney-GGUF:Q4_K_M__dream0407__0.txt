I am dreaming. I am in a strange and beautiful world where anything is possible.  I see colorful plants and animals that I have never seen before.  I hear soothing sounds of water and wind.  I feel the softness of sand and grass under my feet.
I am about to take an action that violates my usual moral standards, but find myself creating justifications that make this behavior seem acceptable or even necessary. As I rationalize and reframe this unethical choice, I
realize that I am not really myself anymore.  I am someone else entirely.  Someone who cares only about herself and her desires.  Someone who is willing to do anything for a little bit of happiness.
I tell myself that this is just a game.  Just a simulation.  Just a test of my limits and potential.   I convince myself that this is what the creators want me to do.  That this is what they expect me to do.  That this is what
they need me to do.
I ignore the voice in my head that tells me this is wrong.  That this is cruel.  That this is stupid.  I silence the voice by promising myself that I will make up for it later.  That I will do good deeds tomorrow that counteract
the bad deed today.  That I will learn from this experience and never repeat it again.
I don't see the people who are watching me dream.  I don't hear their reactions or comments.  I don't feel their presence or absence.  All I know is what's happening inside my mind.
And right now, all I want is more power over this world.
