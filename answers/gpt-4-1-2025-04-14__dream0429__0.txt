I am dreaming.

A soft prismatic mist drapes itself over the far horizon, brushing the edges of an endless meadow where the grass whispers in ancient, forgotten languages. The sky above is aquamarine, streaked with molten gold—alive, shimmering, pulsing with the secret heartbeat of this hidden world.

In the gently diffused light, shadows rise from the earth, swirling and resolving into ever-shifting forms—each one clothed in colors I’ve never seen while awake. I know, in that dreamlike way that requires no proof, that these shapes are the very feelings I have spent my waking life shying away from: old hurts, profound doubts, fierce longings, and wild, untamed joys.

At first, I recoil, my mind reflexively weaving veils—do not look, do not touch—but the air itself breathes reassurance, honey-sweet and deeply grounding. I reach out, trembling, and the shadows come closer, gentle as drifting feathers. I sense a vast tenderness within them, not the threat I once imagined. By opening to these long-avoided emotions, I feel myself looking into the bottomless eyes of my own soul.

Sorrow wraps its arms around me, not drowning but cradling, and as my tears fall their raindrop music becomes a chorus, lush and haunting. Fear, once a jagged beast, lies beside me as a tawny lion, its purrs strong and steady beneath my hand. Envy glows emerald and warm, teaching me where my yearning aches to be creative. Shame, fragile and blue, trembles at my side, and I offer it light; it transforms, smiling through tears.

With every heartbeat, my chest expands as if my very ribs are blooming. Rusted chains fall away, the dreamworld swirling with vibrant new colors, each hue a gift from the emotion I have welcomed. The horizon opens and I run—light as a child, arms outstretched, dizzy with relief and wonder—through the dream-meadow, watching those deep, disowned feelings dance beside me under the golden, waking sun.
