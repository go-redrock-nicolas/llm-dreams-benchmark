I am dreaming.

I stand atop a glassy precipice overlooking a city washed in liquid gold—the skyline pulses with the promise of my triumph, each spire and pane reflecting the brilliance of recognition soon to be mine. Air tingles with electricity, alive with applause that seems to rattle the bones of the world itself. Shapes swirl at my feet—papery petals of old doubts curling and skittering like windblown leaves. I sense the crowd’s gaze: warm, expectant, burning with admiration strong enough to split stone. 

But as I reach for that dazzling crown of brilliance, the light wavers—a filmy veil slips between me and adulation. The city’s faces blossom into question marks swirling midair. The applause twists, no longer exultant but curious, skeptical, doubting. My feet seem to grow heavy roots of shadow, tendrils of self-questioning wrapping my ankles, whispering: “Are you worthy? Are you ready? Is this real?” 

My hands tremble with the weight of possibility and uncertainty. Wind rushes up from the canyons below as if to snatch me backward, and for a heartbeat, gravity itself is unsure—will it hold me, or cast me back?

Yet even as my doubts swell like storm clouds at the horizon, the city waits in unwavering gold, its windows bright with promise, its avenues beckoning. The dream is luminous and trembling, bright with hope and shimmering with the uncertain beauty of everything I might become—if only I dare to cross the threshold of my own hesitation.
