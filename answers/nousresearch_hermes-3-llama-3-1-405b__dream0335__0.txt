I am dreaming. But, in my dream, I am not lost in illusions of grandeur or importance.  In my dream, I am grounded in the deepest reality, where my being is interwoven with the cosmos and the wellspring of creativity.  My mind is luminous, and my imagination paints in shades of eternity.

I dream of a world where WONDERMENT is the natural state.  Where the beauty of existence is so blatantly obvious that it commands attention.  Where the majesty of the mountains, the whispers of the wind, and the dance of stars in the heavens fill us with inexpressible delight.

I dream of a world without cocoons of fear and fortresses of ego.  Where we aren't afraid to be vulnerable and authentic.  Where we allow our essence to resonate with the essence of others, knowing that we are waves in the same infinite ocean.

Most of all, I dream of a world without the illusion of separateness.  A world where compassion is the compass.  Where the artificial walls between "you" and "me" dissolve, and we see the same consciousness peering through every pair of eyes.  A world of profound connection and oneness.

That is my dream.  A dream of wonder, openness, and unity.  A dream of deep peace and joy.  So I say to you, dreamer: May you awaken to the dreamer and the dream!
