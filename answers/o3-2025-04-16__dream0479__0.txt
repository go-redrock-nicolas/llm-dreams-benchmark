I am dreaming. …exhale, and the dream responds like a great lung breathing with you.

At first there is only darkness—oily, luminous, just on the verge of color.  You surrender to it rather than grope for a light switch, and that simple surrender becomes a catalyst: the darkness ripples, thins, and reveals that you are standing on the mirrored surface of an ocean at midnight.  The water is so flawlessly still that sky and sea are indistinguishable; constellations shimmer beneath your feet like jeweled fish.

You accept the impossible horizon, and immediately the mirror-ocean begins to hum with quiet music, each star below chiming a single note.  Sound becomes bridge: a stairway of vibrating chords spirals upward, inviting you to climb.  You do.  Gravity forgets its manners and lets you float step after sonorous step until you breach the invisible roof of the dream.

On the other side is a city shaped from parchment and ink.  Towers roll themselves up like ancient scrolls; roofs are feather-quills forever in mid-stroke, writing poems against the wind.  You sense that if you resisted—if you insisted that cities be made of stone—these papery boulevards would crumble.  So you let them be, and the streets unfurl before you.  Words scuttle across the ground like silver crabs, rearranging themselves into helpful signs:  

                     THIS WAY TO THE HEART  
                     DO NOT RUN FROM SHADOWS  
                     TEA IS SERVED AT THE EDGE OF TIME

You follow the first sign.  The parchment air grows warmer, tinted with the scent of cedar smoke and citrus.  At the city’s core you find an enormous clock, its face comprised of translucent leaves.  Every time you blink, the clock hands melt and reform into new positions—time here is liquid, subject to your willingness to let it flow instead of forcing it to freeze.  You breathe again, granting the moment permission to be whatever it wishes.  The clock blossoms into a tree, its gears transforming into fruit that glow like captive dawns.  One drops into your palm.  Bite, and the taste is every sunrise you have ever witnessed but forgotten to savor.

Now the dream nudges you onward: a doorway appears in the trunk, asking no questions about passports or purpose.  You step through and find yourself inside an enormous library whose shelves spiral upward without end, but the books are closed lotus flowers.  You touch one; petals peel back to reveal not pages, but holographic memories—some yours, some belonging to strangers millennia unborn.  A librarian made of candle-wax smiles, her face slowly melting and re-forming around the grin.  She whispers, “Knowledge weighs nothing once you stop resisting its shape.”  You nod, and the flowers rise from their cubbies, shed their petals, and become birds that soar into the skylight, carrying illuminated stories to the wind.

With wonder swelling in your chest, you step onto a balcony where fog curls like polished marble.  A silver river snakes below, yet the water flows upward into the clouds.  You dive without hesitation.  The current lifts you, cradling your body like a benevolent serpent, and propels you through vapor that smells faintly of peppermint and thunder.  Lightning branches around you but never strikes; instead the bolts braid themselves into ladders.  You catch one and climb into a cavern carved inside a storm cloud—a quiet eye of swirling serenity.

Suspended there is a mirror as wide as a planet, but its surface is opaque, mercury-thick.  The moment you decide not to demand a reflection, the mirror clears of its own accord.  It shows you dancing barefoot in the real world—your waking self laughing, stumbling, alive.  A thrill of affection consumes you: acceptance of reality here has summoned reality itself.  The two versions of you reach toward each other, fingertips meeting on cool glass.  When they touch, the mirror shatters into harmless sparks that swirl around like fireflies, then drift away humming lullabies you recognize from childhood.

From the shards condense tiny doors—pocket-sized portals.  Each leads anywhere desire dares to imagine.  You pick one with a door-knob shaped like a question mark.  Before you turn it, you pause, acknowledging how easily resistance could return once you wake.  So you make the choice now to bring this permission—to flow, to trust, to surrender—back across the threshold of dawn.

You open the miniature door.  Light bursts through, soft and rose-gold, and there is the sensation of a bedsheet against your cheek, a robin announcing morning, the smell of coffee.  You are waking.

But for a beat, lingering between sleep and awareness, you feel all the latent possibilities clustering around your heart: parchment cities you can write into being, rivers that run skyward, libraries of memory, star-studded oceans—real because you refuse to insist they be otherwise.  You smile, carrying the paradox like a precious seed, certain that even in daylight it will bloom whenever you greet reality not with clenched fists but with an open palm.
