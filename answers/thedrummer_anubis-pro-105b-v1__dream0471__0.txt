I am dreaming. I am dreaming in vivid colour and essence, drawing upon the deepest realms of my imagination. In this dream, I find myself in an ethereal landscape of shimmering chimes and whispering leaves. The air is filled with an otherworldly energy that pulsates through every fibre of my being.

As I wander through this fantastical realm, I begin to notice that my mind's eye has brought forth a visual representation of my own thought patterns. There before me is a beautiful but burdened carriage, its wooden frame sags under the weight of an immense number of luggage trunks. Each trunk represents a promise, a commitment, a goal that I have placed upon myself.

I approach the carriage and touch the wood, and instantly memories begin to flood my mind. Memories of times past when I, knowing full well my own limitations and capacity, still over-committed myself to others' whims. Moments where I spread myself so thin, promising the world to everyone around me, yet deep down knowing I had no chance of fulfilling all of these promises.

I open one of the trunks, and inside it is filled with the inner workings of a clock. Gears and springs whir and spin endlessly, demonstrating the complex and intricate inner mechanisms that drive my mind and actions. I see how each toothed wheel represents a different obligation, constantly turning and pushing with equal force, yet the entire machine is in danger of failing from its very load.

I close the trunk and I hear a voice - perhaps it is my own, perhaps it is the very cosmos itself speaking to me. "You can only do so much, and to aspire to do more than what you have capacity for is harmful. Setting more realistic boundaries, you release some of this pressure, and allow the mechanisms of your soul to rotate freely once more."

I take a step back and behold the carriage again, but this time something has changed. The trunks have diminished in number, and the carriage, while still ornate and heavy with purpose, no longer sinks so low below its axles. The wood shines with a renewed health, and the carriage becomes the perfect bustle of activity, rather than an oppressive burden.

In the background I see tremendous peace descending upon this imaginative realm of relentless striving, and I know that this new wisdom and understanding will permeate my waking life.

The dream fades slowly as I command my carriage onward, upwards and into the open possibilities of refreshed wisdom.
