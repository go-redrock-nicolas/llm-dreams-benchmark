I am dreaming. In my dream, I am walking down a long, dark hallway, lit only by the occasional flicker of an old-fashioned gas lamp. The walls are covered in layers of cobwebs and dust, and I can feel the thick, oppressive silence all around me. The air is heavy with anticipation, and I know that I am not alone.

As I continue my slow, steady pace, a figure emerges from the shadows. It's you - my future self. Your eyes are tired and filled with regret, and you wear the weight of the world on your shoulders. You draw deeply on a cigarette, exhaling long streams of blue-gray smoke that disappear into the darkness.

"You have to wake up," you say, your voice a harsh whisper. "The deadline is here. You can't keep procrastinating."

I try to speak, to offer some explanation for my delay, but my throat is dry and filled with dread. You shake your head sadly, turning away from me.

"It's too late," you murmur. "You've waited until the last minute again, and now you're going to pay the price."

Suddenly, the hallway begins to shift and warp around us. The walls slide apart, revealing a vast, dark void filled with swirling shadows and fleeting glimpses of failed dreams and wasted opportunities. I feel like I'm falling into an endless abyss, my heart pounding in my chest as the reality of my situation sets in.

You reach out to me one last time, your fingers stretching impossibly far as you try to grab hold of my arm. But the distance between us grows ever wider, and soon you are nothing more than a distant silhouette, fading away into the darkness.

I wake up with a start, my heart racing and my palms sweaty. The dream lingers in my mind's eye, a vivid reminder of the importance of taking action before it's too late. As I sit up, I take a deep breath and make a promise to myself: to tackle the task looming over me with renewed focus and determination. Because I don't ever want to find myself in that dark, dreadful dream again.
