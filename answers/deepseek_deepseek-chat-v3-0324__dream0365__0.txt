I am dreaming. I feel the breath catching in my chest, uneven and fluttery like a trapped bird. My shoulders creep upward, knotting with tension, as if invisible strings pull them toward my ears. This is more than nervousness—it is the electric prickle of anticipation before something monumental.

Around me, the air shimmers with possibility. The ground beneath my feet is not solid earth but shifting mosaic tiles, each one inscribed with symbols I can almost decipher—glyphs of past failures, future triumphs, and roads not taken. They rearrange themselves as I step forward, whispering in a language that dances just beyond comprehension. 

A great doorway materializes before me, wrought from smoke and starlight. Its archway pulses like a living thing, breathing out gusts of wind that carry the scent of thunderstorms and orange blossoms. I know—with the certainty of dreams—that beyond this threshold lies the challenge that has set my body alight with nervous energy. 

As my fingers graze the luminous surface, the door dissolves into a swarm of fireflies. They spiral upward, forming a constellation that mirrors the rapid tattoo of my heartbeat. The mosaic path now leads into an impossible forest where trees grow upside-down, their roots cradling galaxies in tangled tendrils. Somewhere in that vertiginous wilderness, the thing I fear and desire most waits. 

My next exhale comes out as visible vapor, curling into the shape of a key. I catch it before it dissipates, feeling its weightless solidity. The dream bends closer, holding its breath. Every cell in my body thrums with the primal understanding that this—the tension, the trepidation, the dizzying wonder—is the alchemy that precedes transformation. 

What happens next is yours to decide...do I step through? Do I turn back? The dream holds both possibilities in suspension, quivering like a soap bubble at the tip of a blade.
