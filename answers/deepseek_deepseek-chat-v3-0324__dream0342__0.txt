I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of blooming jasmine and damp earth when I first notice it—the subtle shimmer in the air like heat haze, but cooler, more deliberate. The sky isn’t quite the right shade of blue; it’s deeper, richer, almost translucent, as if the atmosphere itself is made of liquid sapphire. I walk barefoot along a path lined with smooth, iridescent stones that hum softly beneath my feet, their song a whispering lullaby in a language I almost understand.  

Then I see them—the trees. Towering spires of living crystal, their leaves delicate fractals turning slowly in the breeze, casting prismatic rainbows over everything. They pulse with an inner light, slow and steady like a heartbeat. One of them bends toward me, a low branch extending like an arm, and in its translucent surface, I see movement. Images flicker—snippets of my own life.  

There I am, tossing a single-use coffee pod into the trash. A harmless act, routine. But the tree shudders, and the vision expands—a thousand pods, ten thousand, a million, all tumbling into a chasm where they melt and swell into a black, oozing tide. It seeps into the roots of the crystal trees, staining them from within. Their light dims. Their song stutters.  

A figure steps from the bark—somewhere between human and dryad, skin the color of moss, eyes reflecting galaxies. "Each choice folds into the next," they say, their voice like wind through reeds. "Convenience is a chain, and you hold every link."  

The ground beneath me trembles, and suddenly I’m sinking, not into earth but into the black tide itself. It’s cool and thick, clinging to my skin, and inside it, voices whisper—future voices, maybe, or echoes of creatures not yet born, choking on what we’ve left behind.  

I wake with a gasp, the last remnants of the dream still clinging like dew. The air in my room is ordinary again, but the weight of the choice remains—small, everyday decisions rippling outward, changing worlds unseen.
