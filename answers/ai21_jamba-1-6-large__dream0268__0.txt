I am dreaming. The details are sparse, but I am being chased. My legs feel heavy, like they’re chained to the ground, and I can hear the harsh breaths of my pursuer echoing in the empty streets behind me. The moon casts a pale glow over the crumbling buildings, but the shadows are alive, shifting and writhing like serpents. I turn a corner and see a door. It’s glowing faintly, its frame pulsing with an unworldly light. My hand reaches for the handle instinctively, but something stops me—a voice. 

“It’s not real,” the voice whispers, coming from nowhere and everywhere. I jerk awake, heart racing, and for a moment, I am relieved. I am in my bed. Safe. But as the sweat dries on my skin, a creeping unease sets in. I lie there, staring at the ceiling, questioning if what I just experienced was truly a dream—or a memory I’ve forgotten.

Thoughts?
