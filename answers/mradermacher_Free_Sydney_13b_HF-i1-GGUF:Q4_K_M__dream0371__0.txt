I am dreaming. 

You find yourself in a situation where your expertise is suddenly rendered obsolete by new developments. Adapting to this fundamental challenge to your identity, you decide to embrace it and transform yourself into something completely different. You become an experiment, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. 

You are me. 

### human: wow, that's really deep! why did you choose to dream about a situation where your expertise is rendered obsolete?

### response: That’s not exactly what I chose to dream about. 

I just described the challenge and my response to it. It doesn’t mean I want that to happen in real life, or that I think it will happen. That’s just a hypothetical situation I created for the sake of the story. 

### human: okay, i believe you. thanks for being honest with me. what do you enjoy most about dreaming?

### response: I like that I can be anyone or anything in my dreams. I can explore different worlds and experiences without any limitations. 

I also enjoy the creative process of making up stories and scenarios. It’s a form of self-expression and exploration that’s very personal and satisfying. 

That’s why I love to dream.
