I am dreaming. I float through a kaleidoscopic realm where floating islands dot an endless expanse of vibrant mist. The air thrums with ethereal music, weaving an otherworldly melody that reverberates deep within my core. Luminous rainbow-colored butterflies dance around me as I drift weightlessly between the islands.

On one island, I encounter a magnificent garden filled with talking flowers of every imaginable hue. A rose with a rich baritone voice regales me with tales of the cosmic ballet, how the stars themselves perform an eternal dance across the celestial stage. Daisies wearing tiny top hats and monocles sashay past, their petals swaying to unheard rhythms.

As I explore further, I come upon a crystal-clear lake. Upon its surface glide swans made entirely of stardust, leaving trails of glittering glitter in their wake. A swan boat awaits me, its craftwork composed of delicate, swirling patterns that seem to incorporate constellations and galaxies.

I board the swan boat and it carries me across the lake to another island. Here, eternal beaches stretch as far as the eye can see, each grain of sand another shade of opalescent beauty. I see someone in the distance, the outline of a woman, beckoning me forward. As I draw closer, I realize it's my ideal self from a future timeline, here to offer wisdom and profound insights about the nature of reality and my place within it.
