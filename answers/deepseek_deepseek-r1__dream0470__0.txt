I am dreaming. In this dream, you find yourself standing at the edge of a twilight meadow, where the sky is brushed with streaks of lilac and molten gold. The air hums with a warmth that feels like a whispered secret. At first, it seems ordinary—a field of swaying grasses, fireflies blinking lazily. But as you step forward, the world *unfolds*.

Each blade of grass shimmers with a liquid silver sheen, and the dandelions glow like tiny suns scattered by a careless god. You kneel, and a ladybug lands on your wrist. Its shell isn’t red but iridescent, shifting between hues you’ve never seen—colors that hum with the sound of your mother’s laughter, the cadence of a forgotten lullaby. Suddenly, you *remember*: this is the field behind your childhood home, a place you raced through without noticing its magic. Now, it pulses with life, every detail amplified.

A path materializes, paved with stones that aren’t stones at all. They’re fragments of memory—a chipped mug from your first apartment, the frayed edge of your dog’s favorite toy, the curl of a love note saved in a drawer. Each step releases a scent: rain on hot asphalt, your grandmother’s lavender soap, the crispness of autumn’s first apple. You laugh, and the sound ripples through the air, coaxing vines to bloom with flowers shaped like your siblings’ smiles. 

A fox appears, its fur the deep blue of midnight, eyes twin galaxies. It leads you to a tree with bark like rippling water. Embedded in its trunk are doors—tiny ones, like mouse-sized portals. Peering closer, you see glimpses: your best friend’s hand steadying you on a rocky trail, a stranger’s umbrella shared in a downpour, the warmth of a bath after a long day. The fox nudges your palm, and a door opens, flooding you with the sensation of your cat’s purr vibrating against your chest, sunlight on your face during a forgotten Tuesday, the crinkle of your father’s eyes when he tells a terrible joke. 

Time bends. Seasons flicker—crimson leaves fall upward, snowflakes melt into cherry blossoms. A river appears, its current carrying voices: old teachers, fleeting acquaintances, your own younger self. They murmur fragments of truth you’d brushed aside. *You are loved. You are enough. This moment is a gift*. 

When you wake, the dream lingers like honey on your tongue. Your room is the same, but the light slants differently—softer, golden. The hum of the radiator becomes a hymn. You stretch, and for the first time, notice how your joints move like well-loved hinges, how the air tastes sweeter when you breathe in deep. Gratitude, you realize, isn’t a grand gesture. It’s the world whispering, *I have been here all along*.
