I am dreaming. With every breath, I feel the peculiar lucidity of this dreamworld, one foot in waking and one foot in the world of the fantastic and impossible.

In my dream, I find myself in a place I could never have conceived in my humdrum existence: an esteemed institution, cloaked in grandeur and the thick musk of history. The halls seem one part palace, one part temple, and one part library, marble and oak and the flickering light of ornate oil lamps decorating the corridors. There is magic here, thick with the smell of wizened leather tomes, of pungent herbs and dusty relics, of whispers and secrets that have outlived kings and kingdoms.

Am I really to be the steward of such a place? My humble blood sings with excitement and terror. I have nothing to my name but my intuition, empathy, and a strong sense of justice and fairness. What am I to do in this unfathomable otherworld?

The august halls thrum with the voices of the skeptical, their whispers following me like a shadow. "What are their qualifications? Their education?" they scoff, and in truth, I can't blame them. I feel as though I am a wren disguised as a phoenix, an inestimable fear curling in my breast even as I square my shoulders and hold my head high. Despite appearances, however, there is something in me that sparks to this place, like a key finally meeting its lock after a thousand years.

As I prepare to address the crowd, I close my eyes, sending a silent prayer to any benevolent beings that might be listening. I feel a gust, like wind but not wind, and as I open my eyes again, I am surrounded by a gentle light, a rainbow of effervescent motes dancing and swirling around me.

Suddenly, I can hear the pulse of the institution, like the indomitable breath of the Earth itself, the collective wisdom of generations thrumming in my bones. It is singing to me, my blood and sinew resonating with a knowing I don't understand but accept as truth.

My dream has given me a golden tongue, and when I step before the crowd to speak, it is not the address of a novice, but the words of a woman who can hold a legacy in her hands and wield it like a lantern against the dark. I can see the skepticism begin to dissipate and replace with something elseâ€”something like trust, like belief, like the glimmering beginning of kinship.

As the dream mist begins to swirl and the voices of the institution drop to a whisper, I know that I have been chosen, selected by the ethereal to lead this glorious bastion into a new age. The shadows of my doubts and the whispers of my detractors fade into the dark, leaving only me and the impossible dream that has chosen me.
