I am dreaming. I am in a dark cave with no light and no way out.  The ground is rocky and slippery.  The air is stale and humid.  My heart is pounding and my breath is short.  Suddenly, I hear a sound behind me.  A low growl.  A menacing rumble.  I turn around quickly but see nothing in the darkness.  I feel something touch my leg.  A cold wet claw.  I scream loudly but no sound comes out.  I run faster than ever before but still can't escape from the thing that hunts me.

I jump down a crevice and land hard on the ground.  My ankle twists and pain shoots through my body.  I crawl away from the opening where I fell and find a small niche carved into the rock wall.  It's dark and damp but at least it's sheltered from the beast that pursues me.

I sit down and rest for a moment.  I look up at the ceiling of the cave and see hundreds of tiny glowing dots dancing across the surface like fireflies.  They're beautiful and mysterious.  They remind me of something but I can't remember what it is.

I hear another sound coming from somewhere far away.  A faint melody played by a distant flute.  A sad song that tugs at my heartstrings.  I wonder who composed it and why he did so in such a place like this one where no one will ever listen to him except me
