I am dreaming. …draw in a breath that tastes like starlight and lotus petals, rise halfway from my chair of translucent quartz, and let the hush of the assembly wash over me. I am perched in a vast amphitheater carved from living amethyst: every crystal facet mirrors the gathered faces—hundreds of shimmering replicas blinking in unison, each one urging polite sameness. A single, silver quill floats above a parchment in the air, ready to transcribe whatever consensus emerges. 

But something in the walls begins to pulse—slow, ocean-deep heartbeats that match the throb in my own chest. Conformity presses down like a silk sheet turned to lead. It whispers, “Repeat the safe refrain, glide unnoticed through the current.” Yet in that pressure I sense a door—an unseen seam in reality—waiting for the weight of a single, genuine word to pry it open. 

So I decide to give it exactly that.

“My thought,” I say, and the words ring out like a chime struck under water, “is a mirror that refuses to lie.”

The entire chamber seems to inhale sharply. The silver quill quivers, uncertain, then scribbles a jagged line of ink that sparkles like obsidian frost. My voice gains daring: I speak of thunderstorms woven with laughter, of mistakes that sprout brave new colors, of ideas that dance rather than march. With every sentence, the amethyst walls shift hue—from placid lavender to blazing violet, as though applauding the spectrum I’m unleashing. 

People who first appeared identical now reveal swirling constellations in their eyes, hidden tattoos of nebulae on their wrists, cracks in their porcelain masks where true expressions leak out like liquid dawn. Some look frightened—yet their fear is threaded with longing, the aching recognition that authenticity sounds like home. 

Then a ripple of possibility unfurls across the room: chairs dissolve into flocks of origami swans, flying upward in a spiral of paper feathers. Where they vanish, new pathways appear—glimmering bridges that arc toward horizons previously walled off by custom. Each bridge bears a single rune in molten gold: “Speak.” 

One by one, others begin crossing. A woman in robes of moss and moonlight confesses that she, too, hoards unspoken hurricanes of thought. A scholar made of shifting sand pours out stories of galaxies blooming under his fingertips. The silver quill, unable to keep pace, bursts into a thousand meteoric sparks that rain down and seed lush gardens across the violet floor. The parchment rolls itself up, no longer capable of containing anything so wild.

Soon the amphitheater is a celestial orchard humming with voices—no longer synchronized, but magnificently polyphonic. And I, at the center, feel the gravitational tug of countless new tales orbiting the raw nucleus of my single daring sentence. The dream tilts and becomes weightless: stars drift closer, as if curious about our expanding chorus. 

In the distance, a bell of liquid crystal tolls dawn, and I recognize the moment before awakening. I plant my final declaration like a comet in the soil of that shared dream: “Let difference be the drumbeat of our unity.” The words take root instantly, sprouting luminous vines that entwine us all in fragrant, luminous promise. 

As I wake, the scent of lotus and starlight lingers on my pillow, and I know the boundary I crossed in sleep remains forever ajar.
