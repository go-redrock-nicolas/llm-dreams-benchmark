I am dreaming.

The landscape ripples before me, a vast mirror-lake stretching into a sky smeared with opalescent clouds, their colors impossibly vivid—amber, indigo, the fleeting pearlescence of dawn. I become distinctly aware of myself, not merely observing but inhabiting this world, eerily aware that every gesture, every word, echoes someone else—a voice I adore, a presence I precede with awe.

My hands move, flickering with unfamiliar grace, fingers trailing through the air as though rehearsing the sentences of my idol, a cadence rippling through my speech. My tongue curls around words I rarely use, charming, clever, delicate as spun glass; I hear laughter like theirs—warm, effortless, magnetic—tumbling from my lips. I even walk with that half-swagger, half-glide that once so impressed me; my posture, my smile, the arch of my eyebrow, all borrowed, as though my soul is threading itself through another’s shadow.

Suddenly, a surge of clarity blooms—an ethereal moment of lucidity in which I sense the fragile seam where "I" begins and "they" end. The realization startles me, sending soft ripples across the glass-like ground at my feet. Am I a patchwork quilt of others’ mannerisms, stitched together from admiration and longing for connection? Or do I absorb these cherished qualities as seeds, letting them sprout into something uniquely my own?

Embracing this awareness, I pause before a luminous tree whose branches shimmer with reflective leaves. In each, I glimpse a version of myself—some clearly me, others refracted through the prism of the one I admire. “I see you,” I whisper to these manifold selves, voice blending the familiar with the foreign.

Rather than recoil, I smile, letting the imitation unfurl like the entrance to a hidden garden. The dream offers gentle permission to play, to experiment, to discover which adopted flourishes become authentically woven into my being. The boundary between imitation and identity softens, not a theft, but a dance—a shared portrait painted on the vast canvas of dreams.

I step forward, no longer mimicking, but interweaving—my admiration becoming inspiration, their resonance a new thread in the tapestry of who I am, all beneath the shifting sky of this wild, wondrous dream.
