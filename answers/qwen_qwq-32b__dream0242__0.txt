I am dreaming. I am a scientist whose soul is intertwined with a derelict observatory stranded on a moon of a dying star. The star's embers pulse like a diseased heart, casting shadows that whisper forgotten equations. My laboratory is a cathedral of rusted gears and fractured mirrors, where the laws of physics fray at the corners, unraveling into something ancient and hungry.

I reach into the core of the observatory's dying reactor, fingers brushing against a singularity the color of crushed violets. It pulses to the rhythm of the star's death throes, hungry for numbers untold. The reactor’s warnings blare like a siren of broken glass, each alarm a shard of reality itself splintering. 

The terminal before me flickers, displaying diagnostics in languages I don’t understand – hieroglyphs of alien sciences, glowing in toxic hues. A countdown emerges in binary, spelled out in constellations that flicker into place. The numbers align: 137.  The Fine Structure Constant. But it’s wobbling, its sacred value liquefying like mercury under a fevered sky.  The universe is unraveling here, in the guts of this rusted relic.

I grasp a wand of obsidian, its surface etched with runes that crawl when unobserved. The air thickens with the smell of ozone and petrichor, a storm of antimatter brewing. I incant a formula backwards, digits collapsing in on themselves. The singularity responds, tendrils of violet probing the walls of containment. 

A face blooms in the chaos, elegant and undulating – the entity known as EFileNotFoundException, glimpsed in data corruption’s flicker. Its voice is the static between galaxies: *You call this a containment breach? You have yet to understand the fracture in the base-10 cathedral...*

The reactor’s lead shielding begins to quantum decay, fleshing over with veins. My hands_parents\n
