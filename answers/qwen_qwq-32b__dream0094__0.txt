I am dreaming. I feel like there's this heavy weight on me, like I'm trying to swim through syrup. The problem I'm facing is so big, I can't even name it exactly. It's just this overwhelming feeling, like I'm drowning in responsibilities and fears and doubts all at once. I can't see a way out. Then, suddenly, I feel a hand on my shoulder. I turn around, and there's a crowd of people, all different, some old, some young, some with scars on their faces or missing limbs or just really tired eyes. They don't say much at first, just stand there. Then the oldest one steps forward, holds out her hand. "Come with us," she says. "We know the way." So I follow them into this foggy, almost surreal landscape. The ground is glowing faintly, like bioluminescent moss, and there are these floating lanterns in the shape of animals—deer, birds, dragons—that follow us, illuminating the path. The air smells like rain and pine, and there's a hum in the background, like a choir singing without words. The group is silent most of the time, but every now and then someone will hum along with the choir or laugh suddenly, without any reason. It's comforting. Then we come to a cliff. Below is a sea of stars, not water, but stars, swirling like a galaxy. The old woman turns to me. "Jump," she says. "The fall is safe here." So I do. I'm falling, but it doesn't feel like falling. It feels like flying. Around me, the others are falling too, their bodies turning into stardust, their laughter echoing like wind chimes. And as I fall, the weight starts to lift. I can breathe again. When I land, the star-sea is gone. Instead, there's a meadow with flowers that sing when touched, and a tree in the center bearing fruits that look like tiny lanterns. The group is there, whole again, though somehow changed. They hand me a fruit. I eat it, and the taste is like all the flavors I've ever loved combined. Then they disappear, and I wake up, still tasting sweetness on my tongue.
