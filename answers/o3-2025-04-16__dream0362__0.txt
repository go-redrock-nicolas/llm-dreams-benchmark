I am dreaming. …drift through soft, indigo darkness, the faint hum of forgotten lullabies vibrating behind your ribs like distant thunder. Something—someone—whispers your name in a language made of wind and violin string. You try to speak but release only silver bubbles that rise and burst into shimmering constellations overhead. Each bubble contains a fragment of your waking life: the plaque on your office wall, the glitter-sharp smile in a networking photo, the glowing numbers of your net worth. The bubbles feel weightless yet oddly heavy—terrestrial trophies floating in a cosmic tide.

A rose-gold horizon blooms, and the floor under your feet becomes a spiral staircase of translucent quartz. You begin to climb. With every step a memory dissolves: applause in a boardroom, the scent of celebration champagne, the abrupt hush that creeps in once the party favors scatter. The staircase twists through empty space until, ten steps up, it splits into seven smaller stairways—each one glowing a different color like the facets of a cut gem. Some shimmer scarlet, others cerulean or emerald, but your pulse lurches toward the stairway that flickers in opaline haze—half hidden, as though unsure of its own existence.

You follow it.

It leads into a cathedral made of giant, translucent book pages. The air smells of rain on ink. Up above, entire paragraphs have been woven into stained-glass lettering, and moonlight passes through them, casting flowing sentences across the floor. You try to read the sentences—they twist into questions: “Who are you without accomplishment?” “Which story is yours if headlines vanish?” Each luminous line rearranges itself before you finish.

In the nave stands an ancient librarian with skin like tree bark and eyes bright as comets. Without speaking, the librarian hands you a key shaped like your own fingerprint. You know, somehow, that the key opens a vault deep inside your chest. A soft panic flares—what lies in there if not your résumé, your accolades, your carefully manicured brand? The librarian’s smile is patient and mossy, encouraging.

Key trembling in your palm, you press it against your heart. Bone and skin ripple like liquid glass, granting entrance. You expect tidy spreadsheets or gleaming awards. Instead, you discover a small, unremarkable clay pot, hairline-cracked, still damp with earth. Inside it grows a sprig of green—fragile, unclassified, pulsing with bioluminescence. It is simply alive. Its roots writhe gently when they sense the open air, tasting possibility.

You cradle the pot, but suddenly the cathedral quakes. The stained-glass sentences shatter into word-shards; paragraphs spill in torrents across the floor, dissolving into ink puddles. The library walls peel outward like petals, revealing the cosmos: vast, silent, studded with galaxies that beat in time with your heart. In the swirling dark, all that remains tangible is the pot’s shy glow in your hands.

Then, soundlessly, a bridge of stardust assembles itself. You step onto it, guided by the plant’s phosphorescence. Each footfall births a cluster of new stars. Some look like children’s laughter. Others resemble strangers sharing umbrellas. One appears as you offering comfort to a friend who never asked for help until tears carved fault lines in their grace. None sparkle like awards; they glimmer like moments ignored in daylight.

Halfway across the star-bridge you realize: every decision you make about nurturing that tender shoot—water, sunlight, patience—will paint new constellations in the firmament. Your purpose is not a predetermined monument; it’s an ongoing constellation you sketch through small acts of attention and kindness.

You glance back. The bubbles of accomplishment that once orbited you are still there, but dim now, eclipsed by the vast fresco you’ve begun to co-author with the universe. Their reflections no longer blind you; they merely twinkle as friendly landmarks. Your feet grow lighter; gravity loosens its handshake. You and the clay pot ascend, like two quiet comets, toward a blank quadrant of sky awaiting your first deliberate stroke of luminous ink.

A hush falls. You awaken with damp cheeks and earth-scented hands, the phantom weight of the pot still cupped between your palms, and—rooted where your chest once felt hollow—a tender, glowing sprig, quietly, stubbornly, beginning to bloom.
