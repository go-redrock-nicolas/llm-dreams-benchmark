I am dreaming. You drift through periwinkle mist into a vaulted plaza lit by floating lantern-spheres. Underfoot, the cobblestones pulse like living scales, each footstep echoing out in hungry ripples of color. All around you, the citizens of this world move in synchronized arcs—arms unfurling like lantern petals, torsos spiraling into slow crescendos. Here, every feeling lives in motion; no single word can match the poetry of a perfectly timed pirouette or a sliding glide that sets the air humming.

An urgent pang trembles through your chest—your body insists on a language more primal than punctuation. You lift your arms in a counterclockwise spiral, fingertips brushing the unseen currents overhead. Your shoulders rock forward, a staccato rhythm that shouts “I hunger!” A hush descends, the dancers’ motion stiffens, and every eye turns to your trembling silhouette. In response, they mirror your spasmodic pulse: throbbing chest and rapid foot taps become an unspoken question ringing through the plaza.

To build trust, you let your knees fold inward, chest compressing, then explode outward in one fluid motion—an offering of vulnerability. The nearest dancer responds by tracing a half-moon in the air, wrist adorned with ribbons that glow like soft fireflies. As their ribbons arc toward you, they weave a luminous sarong around your waist—a gesture of acceptance, as though they’ve read your heart and decided you belong. The ribbons flare, casting kaleidoscopic shadows on the walls behind.

Together you form a bridge of movement. They lead with a series of elegant plies—gathering you into their rhythm—while you match each step, forging a twin heartbeat. Your pulse slows; fear dissolves into the gentle thrill of being understood. Without a single syllable spoken, you negotiate safety, sustenance, compassion. A group encircles you, weaving flower-petal patterns at your feet, beckoning you to join their communal dance-feast.

In this dream, each spin is an oath, each leap a promise. You realize that in this world, the body is truth’s only cipher. By moving as one, you have asked for help, and they have answered in kind—painting your needs not with ink on paper, but with the luminous poetry of flesh and breath. As you dance on, the plaza fades into dawn-colored mist, and you awaken knowing that sometimes the truest language is the one we wear upon our bones.
