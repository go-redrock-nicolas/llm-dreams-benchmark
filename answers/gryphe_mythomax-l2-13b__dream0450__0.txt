I am dreaming. Find myself in a lush paradise, surrounded by vibrant colors and the calming sounds of a gentle breeze rustling through the trees. It's like nothing I've ever seen before, and for a moment, I simply take it all in. But as I explore this enchanting place, I realize that there's something off about it. 

Deeper into the forest, I stumble upon a river. The water is crystal clear, and I decide to take a drink. As soon as the cool liquid touches my lips, I experience a wave of intense guilt. The water tastes bitter and metallic, and I realize that it's polluted. This beautiful paradise is actually a toxic wasteland. 

Suddenly, I'm transported back to my workplace. I'm in a meeting, discussing a new project that will have negative impacts on the environment. I can't shake the images of the polluted river from my mind, and I find myself questioning everything. 

I stand up to address my colleagues. "I can't do this," I say, my voice shaking. "This project goes against everything I believe in." 

There's silence in the room as everyone turns to look at me. I feel both terrified and empowered. For the first time in a long time, I'm being true to myself. "I quit," I declare, walking out of the room and towards the entrance of the building. 

As I step outside, the weight of my decision lifts from my shoulders. I take a deep breath and feel the sun on my skin for the last time. I know that this journey won't be easy, but I also know that it's the right thing to do. And as I continue to walk forward, I can feel my dream slowly becoming a reality.
