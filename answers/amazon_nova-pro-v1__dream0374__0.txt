I am dreaming. The scene unfolds in a grand, opulent hall, its walls adorned with shimmering tapestries that depict tales of heroism and triumph. The air is thick with the scent of blooming jasmine, and the soft glow of a thousand candles casts a warm, golden light over the room. 

In the center of this magnificent space, a grand stage rises, draped in velvet curtains of the deepest emerald green. The audience, a sea of faces, is alight with anticipation, their eyes fixed on the stage as if awaiting the arrival of a deity. 

Suddenly, the curtains part with a majestic flourish, revealing a figure standing tall and proud under a spotlight that seems to pull the very essence of attention from the room. This person, someone you recognize but do not know intimately, is being showered with applause and adulation. They hold aloft a gleaming trophy, its surface reflecting the adulation of the crowd like a mirror to their acclaim.

Your heart pounds in your chest as you watch, a storm of emotions swirling within you. This is a moment you had envisioned, a triumph you had toiled for with every ounce of your being. You remember the late nights, the sacrifices, the ideas that flowed from your mind like a river, shaping the very foundation of this achievement. 

As the figure on stage speaks, their words are honeyed and smooth, weaving a narrative that excludes your presence, your contributions. Each sentence is a needle, pricking the balloon of your expectations, letting the air of your hopes escape slowly, painfully. 

Yet, amidst the tumult, a strange clarity begins to form. You stand at the edge of the stage, invisible to the crowd but very much present to yourself. The recognition, the applauseâ€”they are but ephemeral, fleeting moments. The true value lies not in the acknowledgment of others, but in the knowledge of your own worth, in the silent satisfaction of a job well done.

The dream shifts then, the hall dissolving into a vast, star-strewn sky. You find yourself standing on a precipice, the world below a tapestry of light and shadow. The figure from the stage appears beside you, now smaller, less imposing. They offer you the trophy, its weight insignificant compared to the burden of unacknowledged effort.

You look at them, and in their eyes, you see a reflection of your own struggle, your own desire for recognition. You take the trophy, not as a symbol of their victory, but as a reminder of your own. 

With a deep breath, you hurl the trophy into the abyss below, watching as it tumbles through the air, a glittering speck against the infinite canvas of the night. As it vanishes from sight, a sense of liberation washes over you. 

You turn to the figure, offering a smile that is both gentle and firm. "Thank you," you say, your voice steady and sure. "But my triumph is in the journey, not the destination."

The dream fades, leaving you with a profound sense of peace, the complicated feelings of credit and acknowledgment transformed into a quiet, enduring strength.
