I am dreaming. I am walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically.  I feel a storm
approaching and see dark clouds rolling in the sky.  The trees start shaking and rustling as if they are whispering to me.
The ground becomes muddy and slippery as if it is soaked by heavy rains.  I hear roaring sounds of thunder and rumbling
sounds of lightning.  I see flashes of lightening illuminating the dark forest in eerie ways.  

I run away from the dangerous storm as fast as I can.  I climb up a tree to escape from the floods of water.  I hide inside
a cave to avoid from the strikes of thunder.  I curl myself into a ball to protect from the shocks of lightning.

But then I realize something strange and mysterious happening around me.  I see ghostly figures appearing out of nowhere.
I hear voices whispering in my ears.  I feel hands touching my body.  

Who are they? What do they want? Why are they here?

I wake up from my dream with a sense of confusion, fear, and wonder.
