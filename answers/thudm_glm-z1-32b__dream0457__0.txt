I am dreaming. My mind is a canvas painted with swirling colors of cobalt and lavender, with constellations that shift like liquid. The air tastes like wintergreen and the scent of rain-soaked earth after a thunderstorm. I stand on a cliff overlooking an abyss that churns with nebulae and galaxies, their stars being born and dying in slow motion. My body is weightless, but my heart feels heavy, as though it's a stone measuring the vastness of this space. 

In this place, I encounter a mirror. It's not a flat reflection but a portal—a window into a timeline where I've already navigated countless storms. Each version of me wears a different color:.blue for resilience, gold for wisdom, crimson for audacity. Each one turns to me, their eyes reflecting the same Milky Way that swirls in the sky. They whisper, "You are enough when your heartbeat falters. When the storm clouds gather, remember that you've danced in the rain before. 

The crimson me steps forward, her voice like thunder, yet gentle. "Compassion is not a finite resource. It's the ocean that feeds both shores. When you feel empty, you're looking in the wrong direction. Are you seeing the storm around you? Or the birch tree growing through the cracks in the sidewalk? The birch doesn't curse the winter; it bends, it breathes, it survives." She touches my shoulder, and her hand leaves a gold dust that glows beneath my skin like veins of sunlight. 

The abyss below ceases its violent churns. Instead, it becomes a lake of ink-black water, and a boat appears, rowed by an old woman with eyes like star clusters. She offers me a lantern that holds a flame the color of burning copper. "(Self-compassion is the light that guides you home, even when you're lost," she says. In the reflection of the lantern, I see myself—not as I am, but as I can be. Vulnerable, yet radiant. 

The dream fades as I wake, the gold dust on my skin still faintly glowing, and the taste of wintergreen lingering on my tongue. The sunlight streams through my window, but the memory of that boat and the old woman's words stays with me, a compass in the quiet hours of the day. 

I realize that self-compassion isn't about having it all figured out. It's about remembering that even in the darkness, we carry our own light. Our struggles aren't signs of failure, but maps to our resilience. When the storm comes, we don't need to muster self-compassion—we need to remember that we've always had it within us, waiting beneath the layers of doubt and fear.
