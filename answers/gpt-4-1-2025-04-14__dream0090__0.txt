I am dreaming.

I find myself standing at the base of a silver, spiraling tower that pierces the sky, shimmering with a light that seems to shift through every color at once. The air glows with anticipation—the warm, electric hum of thousands of hopeful hearts—and the ground beneath my feet hums as if alive. All around me, other competitors mill about, some whispering anxiously, others silent with concentration, their faces illuminated by the ethereal glow from the tower. Each of us holds a fragment of crystal, warm and pulsing—a key to our identities and the source of whatever unique gifts we bring to this contest.

A sonorous voice, rich as thunder yet gentle as rain, booms from above:

“Welcome, Seekers. The Time of Choosing begins.”

My nerves spark and fizzle as the first challenge unfolds. With a sudden shift, the terrain morphs, and I stand at the mouth of a labyrinth sculpted from living glass, its walls swirling with reflections and scenes from my own memories—moments of triumph, loss, laughter, heartbreak, hope. To move forward, I must select the truthful path among myriad illusions. As I step inside, the labyrinth responds to my thoughts, twisting and shimmering. I hear the distant echo of my mother’s encouragement, the low music of my childhood, the pounding drumbeat of my own heart.

Suddenly, I come face-to-face with shadows taking the shape of my doubts, their voices insistent, weaving webs of anxieties and regrets. For a moment, I falter. But I close my eyes, press the crystal against my chest, and sing out the promise I once made to myself: “I am more than my fears.” The shadows dissolve into silver mist, and the right path lights up beneath my feet with indigo fire.

At the heart of the labyrinth, I find a single, impossibly tall door wrought from starlight and moonbeams, its handle an iridescent feather. As I reach for it, the dream shifts again. Now I am at the edge of a vast, celestial ocean. Waves made of liquid sapphire curl and crash on the shores of unknown lands. The judges hover above on floating thrones of cloud, waiting. The final task: to leap, to trust, to surrender myself to the promise of transformation, not knowing what awaits below the surface.

With the whole world watching, I dive, and the ocean embraces me: cold, cosmic, limitless. Below the water, I see constellations instead of fish, ancient memories flickering in the dark. I realize that the future I seek is not a prize at the journey’s end. It is here, now, in every risk I take, every doubt I banish, every true note of the song in my soul. As I swim upward, the water turning to golden light, I awaken—not just into the next stage of the competition, but into a boundless, beautiful new version of myself.

And as I break the surface, the world erupts in color and music, and I know: I have chosen, and been chosen. The future has shifted on its axis, and I am ready.
