I am dreaming. **The air is thick with the scent of crushed petals and saltwater, a surreal blend of sweetness and sorrow.**  

I stand at the edge of a vast, mirrored lake, its surface so still it reflects the sky with eerie precision—except the sky is wrong. The clouds swirl in slow, deliberate spirals, forming shapes that almost look like faces, whispering words I can’t quite hear.  

Then I see *them*—my friend, my rival, standing on the opposite shore, bathed in golden light. In their hands, they hold the very thing I’ve longed for: a shimmering, pulsing orb of liquid light, the manifestation of success, recognition, *fulfillment*. It drips between their fingers like honey, and with each drop that hits the water, the lake ripples, distorting my reflection until I barely recognize myself.  

A deep, gnawing ache coils in my chest. **I want it.** Not just the orb—the ease with which they hold it, the way the light clings to them as if they were born to carry it. My fingers twitch, half-reaching, half-clenching into fists.  

Then, the whispers from the clouds grow louder, hissing, *"Why them? Why not you?"* The question wraps around my throat like vines, tightening with every breath. The envy is hot and bitter, a living thing writhing beneath my skin.  

But then—**the water stirs.** My reflection shifts, not into something monstrous, but into a version of myself holding a different light—one that flickers like a candle, small but unbroken. The realization hits like a thunderclap: *This is not their light to give. It is mine to make.*  

The dream shudders, the lake dissolving into mist, the orb fading like a dying star. I wake with the ghost of that envy still lingering, but beneath it, something quieter, fiercer—**the spark of my own becoming.**
