I am dreaming. You drift into a dream that feels both impossibly vast and intimate, as though the shape of your own heart were sprawled out across a boundless sky. At first, you stand at the mouth of a great labyrinth whose walls shift like living vines, each leaf quivering with the colors of dusk—crimson fading to lavender, to indigo flecked with starlight. The ground beneath your feet is neither solid nor sunk, but ripples like quicksilver, and every step carries you forward even as it dissolves behind you. You know this maze represents the new chapter of your life—an upheaval you’ve met before, yet never quite like this.

With each winding turn, familiar faces from past changes materialize as statues carved of frost: a mentor who once guided you through college, a friend whose laughter steadied you in a first job, a partner who helped you find home in a strange city. They stand silent and still, halos of mist drifting around their shoulders. As you brush a trembling hand across a statue’s cheek, frost shards melt into warm rain, and a whispered “You’ve done this before” echoes in your ears, leaving you buoyed and unsteady at once.

Soon the corridors dissolve into a vast sea of lantern-lit boats, each one bobbing on ink-black water. You climb into the nearest vessel, propelled by currents that pulse with a slow, musical heartbeat. Ahead, you glimpse a distant shore glowing like polished brass, yet the path is tangled with thick reeds that coil at your ankles, proving that every voyage must wrestle with doubt. You row through this tangle, chest tight, until a single golden dragonfly alights on your oar—its wings transparent but etched with runes of encouragement. In that glimmer, your arms strengthen, the current shifts, and the reeds part like curtains.

On the far bank, you discover a colossal door carved from pale moonstone. It bears no handle—only a perfectly circular mirror at its center. Your reflection stares back: eyes wide, shoulders squared in determination. Hesitating only a moment, you step forward and place your palm against the cool surface. The glass ripples outward like a pond’s surface, sweeping you through into a sunlit meadow of wildflowers that sway in a breeze scented of honeysuckle and promise. Here, the weight of your uncertainty lightens, and you remember that every new beginning is built on the gold of lessons learned, on the bridges you’ve already burned and rebuilt.

As the meadow’s warmth envelops you, laughter bubbles up—half relief, half triumph. You stretch your arms toward a sky that shifts through every hue you’ve ever loved. And in that instant, the dream dissolves into a soft glow that pulses through your chest, carrying the quiet conviction that, though change is never easy, you carry within you all the mastery of every transition you’ve already braved. Then you awaken, fingers tingling, heart steady, ready once more to step into the unknown.
