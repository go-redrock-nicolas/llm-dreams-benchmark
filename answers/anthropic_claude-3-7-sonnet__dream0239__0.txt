I am dreaming. I enter a realm where the familiar laws of matter dissolve into beautiful impossibility. Before me stretches a landscape that defies comprehension—trees with trunks of flowing mercury that somehow support crystalline branches, their leaves both wispy vapor and glittering solids catching nonexistent light.

To navigate this multiphase environment, I discover my hands can pass through water-walls that still support my weight when I step upon them. The ground beneath me pulses between states—sometimes a springy solid that launches me gently upward, sometimes a dense fog I sink through until reaching a substratum of luminescent liquid that cradles rather than drowns.

The inhabitants here—are they creatures or phenomena?—communicate through ripples of state-change. A being approaches, its core a perfect sphere of obsidian that continuously melts and reforms while orbited by droplets that freeze and vaporize in mesmerizing patterns. It "speaks" by sending cascades of transformation through the air between us, and somehow I understand that perception itself is different here.

I learn to "speak" by focusing my thoughts into the pendant around my neck, which responds by cycling through states, creating harmonious patterns that the inhabitants recognize. They teach me to reshape portions of this reality by singing notes that vibrate at the frequency of phase transition.

In the distance, mountains both flow and stand firm, their peaks disappearing not into clouds but into regions where space itself seems to fold and puddle. The sun is a cool, gentle presence that doesn't burn but instead nourishes everything with waves of potential transformation.

I awaken with the lingering sensation that my own body is merely one possible state among countless alternatives, momentarily frozen into familiarity.
