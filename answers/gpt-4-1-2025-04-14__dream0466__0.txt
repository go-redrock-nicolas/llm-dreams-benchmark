I am dreaming. …I find myself adrift in a city formed from fragments of all my past selves—a place where sunlight flickers through high windows and doorways lead sometimes to crowded alleyways, sometimes to quiet parks shaded by ancient trees. Every street feels achingly familiar yet subtly altered, as though I walk through an echo of memories half-remembered.

The struggle of my current life transition weighs on me in this city—an invisible gravity making each step heavy. In a narrow, crooked bookstore, dust swirling golden in the beams of morning, I leaf through notebooks filled in my own handwriting: reminders of how I once weathered storms of upheaval, how I rose and rebuilt. Yet the ink seems to bleed, letters swimming away from me, the lessons of the past nearly out of reach.

Out on the avenue, time moves strangely. I watch people splitting and merging—old friends and my new colleagues wearing one another’s faces, strangers reciting advice I’ve heard before. Old houses topple, bricks rearranging themselves into unfamiliar forms. I keep moving, searching for the next street or signpost that might guide me through this labyrinth of change.

As the sky darkens to a deep, indigo twilight, an ornate bridge appears ahead. Its structure is fragile—braided from ribbons of light and shadow, pulsing with every step I take. At its center, I pause, gazing down into a river reflecting all the versions of myself I’ve been: triumphant and uncertain, joyful and small, each one waving encouragement from the water below.

The longing for surety tugs at me, but I realize, with a thrum in my heart, that the only way forward is to trust each uncertain step—threading together the wisdom of the past and the wide-eyed hope I’ve always carried. The bridge trembles, humming beneath my feet as I cross, the city behind me fading into mist. In the distance, dawn breaks—soft gold promising new chances, and in this shimmering, shifting place, I finally realize: I am allowed to be not quite settled, to be searching, to be new.
