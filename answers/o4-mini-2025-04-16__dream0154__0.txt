I am dreaming. You awaken in the soft glow of a bedroom where clocks melt like candle-wax, their hands running backward into glowing puddles on the floor. A warm wind brushes your cheek—but it feels as though it already blew across you, and will blow again in a moment yet to come. The walls pulse with living time: rectangles of light slide up and down, revealing snapshots of tomorrow’s breakfast before you’ve even decided what to eat. 

To accomplish even simple tasks in this temporal chaos, you must learn to read the currents of “when.”  
  
You swing your legs over the side of the bed—not forward, but sideways, looping through a doorframe that opens into a hallway tiled with mirrored hours. Each tile bears a fragment of an event yet to occur: a smile you’ll give, a door you’ll unlock, a note you’ll lose and find again. You step first on a tile that shows a kettle whistling. Almost at once the steam curls around you, as if the kettle has already boiled. You reach back and see the kettle on the counter, its lid still cold. But you lift it anyway; the tea is already steeped in your cup before you pour the hot water.  

You walk into the kitchen, and the sink awaits you, full of dishes you haven’t dirtied yet and have also never been clean. A single plate floats up, spinning in the air: on one side it’s stained, on the other, gleaming. You catch it in mid–rotation, scrub the spotless side first, then watch the stain vanish backward into your brush. The bubbles coalesce into pearlescent spheres that pop open, releasing tiny echoes of laughter you will share with someone you have not met.  

In the corner a plant droops; its future self—lush and towering—trembles at the corner of your vision. You scoop up water, expecting to dribble it onto dry soil. Instead, the leaves un–wilt, grow greener, and you realize you are watering a memory of thirst, not the actual parched roots. The water slides upward back into the jug, leaving behind the promise of many blossoms you will harvest tomorrow, yesterday, and today all at once.  

Your toothbrush rests on the sink. You remember the minty freshness before you even lift it. To make the bristles alive, you brush in reverse, tasting the cool swirl of foam, then un–rinse your mouth so that moments earlier you had not even produced a single bubble.  

Every action in this dream-reality is choreography with the future. You learn to dance a backwards waltz through time’s tangled threads:  
 • You sweep a floor by watching it get clean behind you, then trace your broomstep by forward intention.  
 • You unlock your front door by remembering the click that’s already echoed down the hall.  
 • You sit at a table to eat a meal that you will cook only after you’ve tasted it, then decide to serve exactly what you’ve already savored.  

By weaving anticipation and recollection into each gesture, you transform cause and effect into partners in a slow, harmonious loop. And as the dream’s final petal unfolds—when you rise from your chair with everything dusted, washed, watered, and tasted—you find yourself stepping backward through the hallway of mirrored hours, each tile recalling what you have done and will do, all shimmering together.  

Then you wake—still tasting that cup of tea already drunk, still humming the laughter you have yet to share—and carry the reverberations of non-linear time with you, like an echo of a dream that never quite ends.
