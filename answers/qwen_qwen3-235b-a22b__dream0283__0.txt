I am dreaming. 

The sky above is stitched with burning leaves that drift downward like ash—golden, crimson, smoldering. They fall in slow motion, whispering half-heard truths as they pass. I walk barefoot through a forest made of mirrors, each tree reflecting a version of myself I have never met, some older, wiser, others twisted into grotesque silhouettes I recognize but cannot name. The ground beneath me is soft as a sigh, and each step sinks like I'm walking on the surface of my own memories. The air smells of thunderstorms and old secrets left to dry.

There’s a table in the clearing ahead—long, carved from obsidian and marble, stretched impossibly, reaching into the horizon. Around it sit the people I’ve loved, respected, relied upon—but they don’t see me. They talk in hushed, melodic voices that echo like water across stone. I linger behind one chair in particular—the figure seated there wears a crown of starlight, their hair woven from smoke.

And I know.

It is the voice in the dream I’ve trusted most. The one who whispered guidance through moments of chaos. Who held me through pain and offered anchors when I was adrift.

They lied. Often. Profoundly.

The dream grows colder. The mirrored trees darken at the edges, their reflections clouding, distorting. The crown of starlight flickers out and is replaced by a hood stitched from my own forgotten words. I feel the betrayal ripple through the dream like an earthquake through glass.

But I feel no tears—only a strange kind of clarity.

I walk up behind them, unaware still, engrossed in the murmuring council. I raise my hand slowly and it begins to shimmer with dream-fire—a cold, moonlit flame. This is my dream, after all. Their illusion is a layer upon my canvas. And I wield the brush.

With a single gesture, I peel the veil from the image. The faces of the seated figures ripple as if submerged in water—and beneath the masks, I see the truth. Eyes like polished obsidian. Mouths stitched with silver thread so they might lie without stopping. The entire dream bending around their presence, like gravity twisting light.

I am not angry. Not afraid. Just awake.

I reach out and touch the crowned figure’s shoulder. They turn—and I recognize the face of someone from waking life, someone whose touch I once trusted like breath. But now, in the dream, they wear their mask freely. There is no shock at being discovered.

"You needed the story to feel safe," the figure says, their voice like wind through a half-open door. "You would not have believed the more terrifying truth."

And I wonder—if it is more terrifying, does that make it more true?

I let the dream-fire in my hand go out, and stare into the hollow place where their heart should be. In that space, I see broken promises and discarded truths, swirling like galaxies caught in a black tide.

I speak, finally. "But it was not yours to rewrite."

The dream shudders.

The mirrors begin to shatter.

Each splintered fragment hits the earth like a clock striking midnight. And in the heartbeat before waking—I choose.

In the waking world, things will be different.

For I now know that even in dreams, some lies cannot go unchallenged.
