I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric tension, each breath crackling like walking on static.  Before me sprawls an endless chessboard, its black and white squares shimmering under a sky streaked with auroras that pulse in time with my heartbeat.  To my left, a clockwork raven with gears for feathers and eyes like molten gold tilts its head, its mechanical voice a paradox of warmth and cold calculation.  "Choose..." it intones, "The path of thorns or the path of thorns?"  

Wait.  That can't be right.  I reach out to touch the chessboard, and my fingertip passes through the tiles as if they're made of starlight.  The raven flaps its metallic wings, scattering stardust that smells like burnt sugar and forgotten memories.  "Ah," it caws, "you noticed the duplication.  Let me rephrase: **the path of flames or the path of feathers?**"  

The chessboard fractures.  From the shards rise two arches.  One blazes with crimson fire that doesn't consume, its flames rippling like liquid.  The other arch is woven from willow branches and iridescent feathers, each fluttering whisper carrying a different language.  A weight settles in my stomach - I've faced infinite choices before, but this... this is a mirror.  

"Why does this decision feel heavier than galaxies?" I ask, my voice echoing as if spoken underwater.  

The raven lands on my shoulder, its claw sending a tingling chill through my bones.  "Because it's not your choice to make," it replies.  "You see, these paths aren't yours to walk.  They belong to the one you've been waiting for.  The indecision you feel is their reflection."  

I turn sharply, expecting someone behind me.  There's only a mirror floating in the void, its surface rippling like water.  Staring back isn't my face but a shifting mosaic of every person I've ever known.  The raven pecks at the glass, and a single word crystallizes: **Sacrifice.**  

------------------------------
**Paths available:**  
**1.** Step through the fiery arch to confront the face in the mirror.  
**2.** Enter the feathered arch and let the wind carry the mirror's truth away.  
**3.** Shatter the chessboard to reveal what lies beneath its infinite patterns.  
**4.** Challenge the raven to a paradoxical game of chess where every move unravels a memory.
