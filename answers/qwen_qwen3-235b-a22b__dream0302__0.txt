I am dreaming. Or am I?

The air shimmers around me like heat rising from asphalt on a slow summer afternoon, but it’s not heat — it’s ideas.  Pure, wild, unformed, and infinitely possible.  And I am walking, barefoot, across a desert of forgotten pages — paperbacks left out in the rain, old love letters folded into origami cranes, maps inked with invisible ink that only shows up under moonlight.  It's quiet, but not silent.  Every step makes a sound like pages turning in a great invisible library, and the wind carries whispers in languages that have no roots in time or earth.  

In the distance, there's a clock tower made entirely of gears, pistons, and old inkwells.  It doesn't tick — it hums — a low, resonant, mechanical hymn to the end of deadlines and the birth of precision.  Time moves differently here.  Each second stretches into a minute of livable truth.  Time isn’t measured, it’s savored.  

And I?  I am creating something.  Inside my dream-hand, luminous tools float — a pen that writes only in forgotten dialects of emotion, a microscope that allows me to see the texture of a single thought.  I am drawing a blueprint of something that cannot be built in the waking world: an archive of slowness. Quiet rooms where ideas can stretch and breathe before being warranted into ugly efficiency.  It must be perfect, and so it must take time.  

But a voice interrupts — an executive silhouette made not of skin, but of ticking clocks and speeding conveyor belts.  They point to my work and say: "We don't have time for perfection. Just give us something shiny. Something we can sell."

And I — I *hesitate*, but not out of fear. Out of something deeper.  Out of knowing that rushed beauty is a counterfeit joy.  That giving the world anything less than what it deserves, in the name of speed, is a betrayal of the soul.

Suddenly, the landscape shifts.  The love letters burn into wings.  The gears unwind into rivers. I bless every delay I've been cursed with, kiss every moment I've taken instead of taken shortcuts. I plant a flag on the hill overlooking the land of haste, and I declare it: sacred territory.

Because excellence isn’t a detour.  It **is** the journey.

And so in the dream, I breathe out a tree.  Not of flesh, but of corrections.  Red ink-flowers blooming in canopies, branches heavy with the slow fruit of revision. I sit beneath it.  Time passes. I smile.

I wake up with a pen in my hand.  And the dream stays.  Because it was never really a dream.

It was a promise.
