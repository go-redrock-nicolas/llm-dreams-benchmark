I am dreaming. You're transported to a world where your occupation no longer exists and your skills seem irrelevant. To establish yourself in this new reality, you decide to become an artist and create beautiful works of art with colors that are brighter than life itself. You also learn to play music on instruments made of crystal and metal. 
You're happy.
