I am dreaming. The air shimmers with iridescent pollen as I step barefoot onto the soft, spongy ground of a twilight village. Towering bioluminescent mushrooms pulse gently overhead like living streetlamps, casting shifting hues of cerulean and violet across the faces of the gathered villagers.

Their eyelids reveal intricate tattooed patterns when they blink - a different sacred geometry for each person that tells stories of their ancestral pain. One by one, they step forward to perform the Trust Beckoning; scooping handfuls of glowing blue sand from their tear ducts to shape into fragile sculptures of their deepest shames. The sculptures dissolve upon completion, carried away by the wind as shimmering particulates.

When my turn comes, my skin buzzes with resistance - these displays feel like psychic trespass to my guarded soul. Instead, I kneel beside a murmuring stream and begin shaping the wet clay of its banks. My fingers work without conscious direction, crafting not a shame but a question - an intricate latticework sphere with holes that reveal different constellations depending on how the light passes through.

The villagers gather around, their breath catching as they take turns holding this puzzle of stolen star-patterns. In its imperfect geometry they recognize something truer than performed vulnerability - the beautiful struggle of an unready heart reaching across the void. One elder touches her forehead to mine, transferring the warm glow of her eyelid tattoos to temporarily dance across my skin. A different kind of trust, born in the liminal space between our ways.
