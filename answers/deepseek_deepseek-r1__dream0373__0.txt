I am dreaming. **The Dream**  

You stand at the threshold of two doorways, each carved into the trunk of a colossal, bioluminescent tree whose branches claw at a sky choked with nebulas. The air thrums with the hum of distant galaxies. To your left, a door of molten silver swirls with constellations—Orion’s belt glints in its handle. To your right, a door wrought of corroded copper thrums with the pulse of roots, its surface etched with vine-like sigils that bleed sap. Both doors whisper your name in voices you recognize: the silver one in the cadence of your late mentor, the copper one in the laughter of someone you once loved.  

Behind the silver door, you glimpse a staircase spiraling into a citadel of mirrors, each reflection a version of yourself older, grander, achingly alone. The air there smells of ozone and ambition. Behind the copper door, a sunlit meadow unfurls, dotted with faces you’ve cherished—but the grass wilts as you watch, the sky bruising at the edges as if the joy there is borrowed, finite.  

A path of crushed opals shimmers toward the silver door, each step you consider taking sprinkling stardust that erases the ground behind you. The copper path is lined with flickering lanterns whose light warms your skin but casts long, grasping shadows. As you hover between them, the doors begin to bleed into each other. The tree groans, its bark splitting to reveal veins of liquid mercury and mycelium.  

Your hands tremble. The silver door’s constellations morph into equations you once scribbled in the margins of a forgotten journal—work you abandoned for practicality. The copper door’s vines snake toward your ankles, blooming with poppies that whisper, *“Stay, and never hunger, but never grow.”*  

A third presence emerges: a figure woven from smoke and moth wings, their voice the static between radio stations. **“Choose,”** they hiss, **“or the tree will choose for you.”** The ground quakes. Cracks split the opals and shatter the lanterns. In the silver citadel, your oldest reflection shatters a mirror with a scream. In the meadow, the faces blur into watercolor, their voices dampened.  

You step forward—not toward a door, but *into* the tree itself. Sap like liquid amber floods your veins, and for a breathless moment, you are root and crown, memory and maybe. The doors dissolve. The citadel and meadow fractalize into a bridge of iridescent thread, strung between what was and what could be. You wake with the taste of honeysuckle and static, your palms gripping sheets imprinted with the ghost of tree bark.  

The choice remains unmade.  
The dream lingers.
