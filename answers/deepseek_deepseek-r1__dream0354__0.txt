I am dreaming. **I am dreaming.**  

The air smells of burnt sugar and static, thick enough to coat my tongue. I stand at the edge of an endless desert, but the dunes are made not of sand—they’re ash, shifting like black silk beneath a violet sky. Before me, a labyrinth of towering, crumbling hourglasses stretches into the horizon, their glass cracked, sand spilling in slow-motion waterfalls that never hit the ground. Each hourglass whispers a name: *them*, *them*, *them*. Echoes of lovers, friends, those I’ve loved like wildfires and left like ruins.  

A cold wind carries shards of mirror that slice the air, glinting with reflections of faces I’ve known. I step forward, and the ground liquefies beneath me. Now I’m wading through an ocean of obsidian glass, each shard a jagged memory—a fight I repeated, a goodbye I rehearsed, a hand I let slip. The glass cuts, but the wounds bloom into tiny roses, petals dripping with ink. Voices hum beneath the surface: *“You don’t mean it.” “You’ll do it again.”*  

At the labyrinth’s heart, a figure waits. Not a stranger—it’s me, but older, her eyes hollowed by galaxies, hair braided with thorns. She sits atop a throne of fractured clocks, their hands frozen at *3:17 AM*, the hour I always wake choking on unsent apologies. “You built this,” she says, her voice a chorus of every tone I’ve ever used to lie. “You keep choosing the same exit.”  

I try to run, but my legs fuse with the glass, crystallizing into something cold and unyielding. The hourglasses tilt, sand pooling around my throat. But then—a flicker. A single rose petal drifts into my palm, unfolding into a key made of starlight. *“Turn it,”* whispers the wind. When I jam the key into my chest, the labyrinth collapses into a storm of fireflies, each carrying a flicker of a different ending: Me, staying. Me, listening. Me, softer.  

The older version of myself dissolves into smoke, her thorny crown crumbling. The desert shudders, ash transforming into jade-green grass, and the obsidian glass becomes a river singing in a language I almost remember.  

I wake just as the first blade of sunlight cuts through the dark, my pillow damp, my ribs aching—but my hands, for once, unclenched.
