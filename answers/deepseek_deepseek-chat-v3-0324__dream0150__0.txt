I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning incense—sandalwood and myrrh—twisting in slow, serpentine coils toward a sky the color of bruised plums. The city stretches before me, a labyrinth of towering spires and cascading bridges, each structure adorned with intricate carvings that shift and writhe when I look at them too long. The people move like liquid, their garments shimmering with threads of living light, each hue and pattern a precise declaration of rank, allegiance, and intent.  

I am wearing the wrong colors.  

A cold realization slithers down my spine. My robes—deep indigo stitched with silver—mark me as a Scholar-Ascendant, a keeper of forbidden histories. But the sigil at my throat, a pulsating opal, has dimmed to a sickly gray. A grave oversight. A fatal one.  

Whispers ripple through the crowd as I pass, their voices a harmonic dissonance, like wind through crystal. Eyes flicker toward me, pupils slit like those of hunting birds. I have broken an unspoken covenant, failed to renew my allegiance at the appointed hour. The air itself seems to reject me, pressing closer, heavier, as if the atmosphere is judging my worth and finding it wanting.  

Then, *she* appears—the Arbiter of Thresholds, her face a shifting mosaic of gold and shadow. Her gown is woven from the echoes of forgotten names, and when she speaks, her voice is the sound of pages turning in a sealed book.  

*"You have lingered too long in the spaces between,"* she intones. *"To hesitate is to decay."*  

The ground beneath me liquefies, and I sink—not into mud, but into a viscous pool of liquid memory. Faces surge up around me, their features dissolving as I reach for them. The city above recedes, its lights dimming like dying stars.  

And then—I wake.  

But the scent of sandalwood lingers.
