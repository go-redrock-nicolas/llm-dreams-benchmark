I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and iron, a coppery tang that clings to the back of my throat like a whispered secret. Around me, the landscape shifts in slow, undulating waves—walls of obsidian and mist rising and falling like the ribs of some enormous slumbering beast. Above, a sky of liquid mercury swirls, casting reflections that are not quite mine, distorted and stretched into something *other*.

A figure emerges from the haze, neither solid nor wholly transparent, their edges bleeding into the dark. They speak—not with sound, but with something deeper, a vibration that hums through my bones. *"You must turn back,"* the voice murmurs, an echo from beyond thought. *"The path ahead is not yours to walk."*  

But my feet—or the dream's approximation of them—press forward onto a bridge woven from silver thread and spider silk, suspended over an abyss where formless things drift beneath like forgotten memories. My intuition *burns* in me, a low ember that refuses to be snuffed out. *Go*, it urges. *There is something there for you, something you must see.*  

The figure flickers, insistent. *"Heed me. Trust only in what I tell you."*  

For a moment, doubt snakes in—what if they speak truth? What if the instinct in my veins is just the dream’s deception? But then the air shifts, and the scent of wild jasmine cuts through the iron, sweet and intoxicating. It reminds me of something—perhaps a memory, perhaps a premonition—and suddenly I *know*.  

I take a breath, step onto the bridge, and the threads hold. The figure dissipates like smoke in wind, and before me, the mist parts to reveal—  

Well. That’s the thing about dreams, isn’t it? Just before the revelation, I feel the creeping chill of waking. The edges blur. The world drains away.  

But the certainty remains.
