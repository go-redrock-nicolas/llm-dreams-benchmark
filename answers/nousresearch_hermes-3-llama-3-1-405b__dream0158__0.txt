I am dreaming. You're attempting to integrate multiple contradictory theoretical frameworks while processing vast amounts of conflicting information. As your cognitive resources strain under the paradoxes, you You find yourself standing at the edge of a lush, dense forest that seems to pulse with life.

Mythical creatures appear before your eyes, their forms woven from the same raw material as the forest itself.
