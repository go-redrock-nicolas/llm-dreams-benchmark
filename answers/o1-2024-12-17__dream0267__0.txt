I am dreaming. You stand in the middle of a vast, moonlit orchard—though something about the trees is wrong. Their bark looks like polished ivory, their leaves a shade of indigo so deep they could blend seamlessly with the night sky. The fruit hanging from the branches glistens with an otherworldly sheen, as if each apple or pear contains liquid stars. A gentle breeze flows through, carrying the scent of damp earth and faint, metallic undertones, like distant thunder.

You can still hear the echoes of screaming—harsh, rasping sounds that shuddered through the orchard moments before. In the dream's logic, you know that you were the one who caused that terror, that searing pain, though the mechanics of it feel cloudy and distant. You sense their presence, that person you harmed, drifting through the trees like a wounded animal whose howls have tapered into raw, eerie silence. You know you have done something unspeakable, a violent wrongdoing that left them broken in both spirit and form.

Yet no sorrow gnaws at your belly, no shame prickles your skin. Instead, a slow, simmering satisfaction has taken root. It spreads through your veins like a creeping vine, peacefully unfurling in the wake of your deed. This sensation is confounding, not because it is shocking, but because it is so calmly certain. You realize your moral compass has gone silent in this place—there is no voice warning you, no pang of empathy demanding atonement.

Feathery clouds pass overhead, momentarily blotting out the moonlight. Darkness intensifies, and the orchard transforms into a forest of silent silhouettes. The tips of the ivory trunks reflect starlight, and the fruit now glows an even more haunting white, each piece a lantern guiding your gaze to the absence of remorse in your chest. You marvel at the emptiness where guilt should be, a hollow chamber you try to peer into, as if searching for an explanation. But the more you look for remorse, the more you sense the quiet hush of emotions that simply do not exist.

In this dream-silence, a hush falls over every living creature. No night birds call, no insects buzz, no footstep cracks against twigs. The orchard seems to tremble in your presence, the trees quivering at the raw display of heartlessness. You move toward a central clearing; a single, massive pearlescent tree stands there, shaped with elegant, twisting branches that arc like the arms of a dancer. At its base, shards of bark and collapsed fruit form a mosaic of silver and navy, as though someone spilled the essence of the moon on the ground. 

Stepping closer, you pause, knowing that the one you harmed must be near. The faint smell of blood and regret—though not your own—mingles with the metallic air. Still, nothing stirs beneath your rib cage to suggest pity or apology. Instead, you catch yourself tracing spirals in the glimmering dust with your fingertips, as if drifting into a reverie while your victim cowers behind a trunk or beneath a bush somewhere beyond your view.

Reflecting on this strange emptiness, you feel both powerful and disconnected. The orchard is your realm now, overshadowed only by your curiosity about your own indifference. Looking around, you spot a pool of dark water, thick as ink, tucked between the roots of the giant tree. You approach it, expecting to see a reflection of your face. Instead, the water’s surface shows flickering images: your victim lying in a heap from an event you can’t quite recall. Bruises, cuts, and heartbreak are etched into their features, but the memory forms hazily—like a loose tapestry of misery you can’t be bothered to fully admire.

In another corner of the water’s reflection, you glimpse your own eyes—hardened and unrecognizable, glinting with an eerie fascination. The more you watch, the more your reflection twists into something alien, as though the orchard’s moon-kissed magic has found a home within you. But still, there is no turning away. No rush of compassion or pity forces you to lower your gaze.

You tilt your head back, letting the orchard’s impossible moonlight pour over you in luminous waves, while that unshakable calmness settles even deeper. Then, in a single exhale, you recognize the stark truth: there is only the act and its consequence. No moral burden weighs on your shoulders. It’s as if you stand above the orchard, above reproach, veiled in a serene cloak of detachment. The silence dances around you, pregnant with the atmosphere of a place that has seen too much suffering to speak of it anymore.

And as the dreamscape throbs with its ghostly glow, you find your lips curving into the faintest of smiles—an admission that you do not miss what you do not feel. In this land of indigo shadows and shimmering bark, remorse is a leaf that has never grown on your personal branch. Instead, your silent acceptance pulses in your heart like the orchard’s quiet night, serene and unchallenged, waiting for you to awaken and remember (or perhaps forget) that you caused so much pain… and felt nothing at all.
