I am dreaming. I discover that my fingertips can sense the electric pulses emanating from the philodendron by my window. At first, it's merely a faint tingling, like static electricity dancing across my skin. But as I focus, the sensation transforms into distinct patterns—a language composed of bioelectric rhythms and subtle vibrations.

The philodendron speaks of rain memories and sunlight songs. Its consciousness unfolds before me—not human-like, but ancient and patient, experiencing time as geological rather than biological. It shares stories of generations of my ancestors who touched its ancestors, a living memory spanning centuries.

Soon I can understand all the plants around me. The moss between sidewalk cracks whispers secrets of urban water flows. The ancient oak in the park communicates in slow, resonant pulses that feel like wisdom distilled into pure sensation. Each species has its own dialect, its own perspective—some concerned with immediate survival, others with multi-century reproductive strategies.

I learn that plants communicate constantly through vast mycelial networks, sharing resources and warnings. They recognize me now as something new—neither threat nor insignificant passing creature, but as interpreter. They begin sharing knowledge accumulated over millions of years of evolution: remedies for ailments humans haven't named, warnings about subtle environmental shifts too gradual for our instruments to detect.

Most astonishing is their perception of consciousness itself—they experience awareness as distributed rather than centralized, collective rather than individual. Through chemical exchanges with soil microbiota, they achieve a type of dreamstate that transcends physical boundaries, connecting to something greater that humans have only glimpsed in our deepest meditative states.

As I walk through a forest glade, I feel myself becoming a nexus in their vast communication network—a translator between worlds that have existed side by side yet separate since the dawn of humanity.
