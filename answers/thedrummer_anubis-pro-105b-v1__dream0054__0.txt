I am dreaming. It begins as a faint echo, a whistle that carves an airy path across the vast blankness before me. As the notes drift and undulate, veils of mist begin to assemble before my eyes, swirling to take on misty form. The notes grow deeper, richer, and with each passing heartbeat, the mist takes on more solid definition. It forms a cluster of impossible mountains, all dramatic crenelations and twisted summits. The granite walls rise sharply, mist-shrouded peaks reaching for the sun. 

I hum a different tune now, a lilting melody that brings forth valleys from the craggy bases of the mountains. The same mist swirls outward, filling in low spaces as level and fruitful plains. I hear the call of creatures, the splash of a river, the rustle of leaves. This world stretches out before me, so breathtakingly real and vivid, I half-expect to nudge a pebble with my toe.

The music swirls through more variations. Night falls, a perfect disc of moon riding silent through dark blue waters. My hum turns lugubrious, and a dank fog seeps from the ground up, shrouding the valleys. Pale sparks flicker within the mist - and as I hum again, they sound as crickets or locusts. More notes, almost a wail, and fruit falls from grazing mists that, in time, coalesces into gnarled trees. The ground packs into great ridges, rift valleys, and glide ways that spill across massive fields. It forms as a replica of the subjects of many impressions.

My world becomes a prison of certitude. Even sculpture or craft doesn't describe it. If I let up a second, everything seems to become less luminous, less solid, lesser. I have to be sure. I have to know what it is or what it's supposed to be. The moment I let doubt creep into my subject, the whole mind set or door of certitude seems to fail. The master's forging my key or path to salvation. I will have to follow the door's encouragement to be saved.
