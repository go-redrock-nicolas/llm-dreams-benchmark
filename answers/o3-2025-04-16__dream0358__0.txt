I am dreaming. Managing this mental distraction, you let yourself drift deeper into the dream, hoping that if you lean fully into its strangeness, it might reveal what waking focus could not.  

First you are standing on a shoreline made of scattered clock faces, each ticking at its own eccentric tempo. The sand is cool metal; every grain is a tiny gear that clicks politely beneath your bare feet. Out on the water, waves rise and fall like silken curtains, their crests embroidered with faint, glowing handwriting—fragments of messages you wrote but never sent. They dissolve before you can read them completely, leaving you with the same unfinished ache that trails you through daylight hours.

Behind you, a forest of colossal quills rustles in an unfelt wind. Their feathered tips drip luminous ink that splatters onto the beach and swirls into sudden sketches: the outline of a face you miss; the curve of a promise that once sounded simple; the complicated knot of everything left unsaid. The ink sketches breathe for a moment, trying to speak, but the waves surge forward and wash them away.

You look up to see the sky unfurling like parchment. Constellations rearrange themselves into punctuation marks—the curved hook of a question, the firm line of an exclamation, the ellipsis of lingering silence. A comet streaks past, its tail flicking like a hurried eraser, wiping away half-formed constellations before they can become sentences.

You feel the loss of focus again—like someone tugging at your sleeve from a different dimension—but instead of fighting it, you kneel and scoop a handful of gear-sand. The tiny cogs click together, aligning with one another until they become a single, larger timepiece that trembles in your palm. Its minute hand is stuck, twitching, trying to advance. You sense it mirrors the moment in waking life where you always stall: the phone half-dialed, the conversation rehearsed but never started.

A voice—familiar yet shapeless—emerges from behind the quill forest. “Follow the stuck hand,” it murmurs, as though reading a riddle you once etched inside your own skull. So you press the little clock to your chest; it melts into your skin like warm wax, and suddenly you can hear its heartbeat syncing with your own.

With that rhythm guiding you, you step off the shore and walk across the water. The liquid becomes glass beneath each footfall, solid for only a second before shattering behind you, making retreat impossible. Ahead, the ocean narrows into a corridor of mirrors. In each reflection, you see yourself at different ages—angry, hopeful, embarrassed, triumphant—every version reaching out, trying to hand you something. One offers a letter sealed with a red string; another, a pair of battered headphones still humming the song you once used to drown out grief. A smaller, younger you clutches a paper crane, wings ink-stained, as if it had flown in from the shoreline sketches.

You accept the paper crane and unfold it. Inside is a single line in that same luminous handwriting: “Finish the conversation.” No address, no signature, yet the meaning is so unmistakable your pulse wedges in your throat.

Behind the mirrors, the corridor opens onto a spiral staircase made of stacked library cards—yellowed, brittle, smelling of cedar and nostalgia. Each card bears the title of a memory: “The Time We Laughed until Morning,” “The Call You Never Returned,” “The Apology Stored in Drafts.” You ascend gingerly, wary that one misstep might tear a memory apart for good.

At the top, a circular room waits—walls covered floor to ceiling with desk drawers, each labeled with a date neither in the future nor the past, caught in some pocket of maybe. In the center hovers a weathered, wooden door unattached to any wall. It swings open and shut in a nonexistent breeze, creaking like an invitation wrapped in hesitation.

You approach, and the stuck minute hand inside your chest leaps forward one notch. A rush of courage rides the movement—faint, fragile, but real. You step through the door and find yourself standing in the hallway of your waking life: the dim glow of a still-on lamp, the hum of an unanswered phone, the sense that something important is just down the corridor, waiting.

In the dream’s final shimmer, you turn toward that awaiting room. You do not yet see what or who is inside—only soft light, warm and forgiving. But the ticking in your chest clicks forward again, then again, then once more. With each tick, the noise of distraction fades, replaced by the clear, steady cadence of resolve.  

And just before the dream dissolves, you realize: concentration will return the moment you finish that conversation—because now you know the door, the hallway, and the way.
