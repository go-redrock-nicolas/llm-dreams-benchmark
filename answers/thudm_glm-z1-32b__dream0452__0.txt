I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of petrichor, a storm having just passed.  I am standing at the edge of an ancient forest, the trees looms like sentinels, their branches twisted in cursive.  My hands are calloused from months of sculpting marble, but tonight, they are bare.  I can feel the damp earth through my leather soles, the cold seeping into my bones, yet I am not cold.  

There is a path here, soft with moss and pine needles.  It winds into the woods, leading to a clearing I have seen twice in my waking life, both times as a fleeting glimpse in my peripheral vision.  This clearing is where the well of emotions flows—a silver pool reflecting the stars even in daylight. T You are not yourself here. Your heart is three shadows—one dancing around a bonfire, one submerged in the pool, and one perched on a branch whispering secrets to the wind. The sky is the color of a bruise, and the stars are made of shattered glass.  You have three shadows, and each one is you, but also not.  The one around the bonfire is laughing, but her laughter is the sound of breaking bones. The one in the pool is silent, her eyes reflecting the stars, which here are made of mercury. The one on the branch is whispering, and her whispers are the names of the dead.  You know that you are three people here, but you also know that you are not.  The bonfire crackles, and the wind picks up, carrying the scent of burning hair and roses.  The pool shimmers, and the stars above seem to weep.  

The path splits here, three ways.  The left path is lined with roses that bleed black sap.  The middle path is a staircase of obsidian, each step etched with the faces you have loved and lost.  The right path is a river of memory, its currents pulling you toward a waterfall that thunders with the weight of every "I love you" you have ever spoken.  You stand at this crossroads, your three shadows merging into one as you step forward, your choice echoing in the silence that is not silence.  The air tastes like copper and.  You are not sure which path to take, but you know that you must choose.  The shadows separate again, each pulling you in a different direction.  The bonfire shadow hisses, "Stay.  Let the fire consume you.  It's warmer than the cold truth of what comes next."  The pool shadow murmurs, "Dive.  The stars want to see your face."  The branch shadow cackles, "Fly, fly, fly—away from it all."  You close your eyes, and when you open them, you are walking down the middle path, each step a face, each step a memory, each step a reminder of what you have become.  The obsidian is slick, the faces smooth, and as you ascend, the wind dies down, and the sky begins to lighten, the bruise fading to a bruise-purple.  At the top, there is a door.  It is made of teak, carved with vines that twist into serpents.  The handle is a human hand, its fingers curled around the doorknob.  You knock, but the hand does not move.  You try the door, and it swings open, revealing a room filled with clocks.  Some are ticking, some are broken, some are just eyes.  In the center of the room, there is a mirror.  You step toward it, and your reflection steps away, until you are both facing each other across the length of the room.  Your reflection smiles, and her teeth are made of knives.  She says, "You know what you have to do."  You nod, and step closer.  She steps closer.  The clocks are ticking faster now, and the serpents on the door are hissing.  You reach out, and your hand passes through her reflection.  The reflection reaches out, and her hand passes through you.  You both laugh, a sound like breaking glass.  The room begins to collapse, the clocks shattering, the mirror cracking, the serpents on the door breaking free, coiling around your ankles.  You wake up.
