I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a circular amphitheater carved from luminous alabaster stone. The space is filled with echoing voices—each one offering a piece of advice, an observation, a gentle criticism. At first, I feel my shoulders tense, my jaw tighten. Words rise like shields in my mind: "They don't understand," "I already knew that," "That's not fair."

The air thickens around me, transforming into swirling mist that takes the shape of my own defensive thoughts. Each excuse, each deflection becomes visible—shimmering barriers that separate me from the speakers below. I reach out to touch one of these translucent walls and feel it hum with nervous energy—my own anxiety given form.

Suddenly, a warm breeze cuts through the amphitheater, carrying the scent of cinnamon and salt. The wind whispers, "What if you let them fall?" I understand immediately—these barriers aren't protecting me; they're isolating me.

With conscious effort, I open my hands and imagine the defensive walls dissolving. Each one melts like spring ice, pooling at my feet in puddles of liquid silver. As they disappear, the voices become clearer, kinder, their intention unmistakable: connection, not criticism.

My chest expands with each breath, a peculiar lightness replacing the heaviness that had settled there. The amphitheater transforms, seats filling with versions of myself at different ages—all leaning forward, eager to learn, eyes alight with curiosity rather than caution.

I walk to center stage, vulnerable but strangely powerful, ready to receive what I had been pushing away. The dream shimmers with possibility, growth spiraling upward like vibrant vines climbing toward sunlight.
