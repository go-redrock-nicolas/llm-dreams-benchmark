I am dreaming. I find myself suspended in a crystalline chamber where Euclidean geometry has lost all meaning. Triangles shift and breathe before my eyes, their angles somehow adding up to 720 degrees while simultaneously being perfectly equilateral. The walls of the chamber are both curved and straight, existing in a superposition that my mind struggles to process.

As I float through this impossible space, mathematical formulas materialize like glowing strands of DNA, twisting and recombining into new theorems that shouldn't exist. I reach out to touch a MÃ¶bius strip that has three sides instead of one, and as my fingers make contact, the entire chamber kaleidoscopes into fractal patterns that extend infinitely inward and outward simultaneously.

The paradox deepens as I witness a perfect circle with corners, each angle precisely 90 degrees yet maintaining perfect circularity. Numbers flow like water around my consciousness - I can see prime numbers dividing evenly into each other, creating harmonious patterns that defy everything I've ever known about mathematics.

The space begins to pulse with a rhythm that seems to follow the Fibonacci sequence, yet each number is both larger and smaller than the one before it. I feel my understanding of reality transforming as I grasp equations that can only exist in this dream state, where parallel lines intersect in infinite points while remaining parallel.

Time becomes geometric, bending into shapes that allow me to view past and future mathematical truths simultaneously. I witness the birth of new numerical systems that operate on logic that would be impossible in the waking world, yet here they solve unsolvable problems with elegant simplicity.

As the dream intensifies, I begin to understand that I'm not just observing these mathematical impossibilities - I'm becoming one with them. My consciousness splits into prime factors of itself while remaining whole, and I can feel the weight of pi resolving into a finite, perfectly rational number that somehow still stretches to infinity...
