I am dreaming. In my vivid dream, I find myself standing at the edge of a sprawling construction site. The harsh glare of floodlights casts an eerie glow across the behemoth of steel and concrete rising before me. I'm the chief engineer overseeing the build of a revolutionary new high-speed railway system – a technological marvel that will whisk passengers from New York to Los Angeles in under an hour.

The pressure is immense. A single measurement error of just one millimeter could send the entire multi-ton bullet train careening off its tracks at Mach 5. Lives hang in the balance as I scrutinize every detail, every weld, every groove.

But tonight, something feels off. As I patrol the Dog and Bone scaffolding, I notice unfamiliar faces among the nightshift crew. The usual laser-like focus seems to have dissipated, replaced by a troubling laxity. Workers chat and joke, paying more attention to their phones than precision instruments.

I approach my loyal foreman, Mike. His normally pristine hard hat is smudged with dust, and I catch him suppressing a yawn. "Keep an eagle eye on things, boss," he warns with a pat on the shoulder. "These new guys, they don't get the stakes. Keep telling them 'close enough is good enough'."

My stomach lurches. I rush to a support beam, raising my calipers for a quick double-check. The measurements are off. Way off. Searing dread floods through me as I sprint from column to column, each inspection revealing ever greater discrepancies.

We're not just building insufficiently – we're building dangerously. The structural integrity isn't just compromised, it's fundamentally flawed. How and why don't matter – the how can wait until later. Right now I need to halt construction immediately and quarantine this entire section.

But as I turn to call for an emergency shutdown, I realize I'm alone. The entire site is deserted. The floodlights flicker ominously and a bone-chilling wind whips through the skeletal structure of beams above. In the distance, through the haze of construction dust, I see the unmistakable silhouette of the maglev train accelerating down the track, picking up speed.

My dream self screams a warning, but any cry is drowned out by the shriek of the approaching vehicle. Time slows to a crawl as I watch, paralyzed with horror, as the massive bullet-like machine hurtles directly toward the compromised section I've only just discovered to be catastrophically flawed.

And then everything goes black. The dream fades, leaving behind the haunting question of whether the nightmare was over, or had only just begun. Had I woken in the nick of time, or had that moment of blackness been... the moment of impact?
