I am dreaming. You decide to create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of your imagination. You are in a dark forest with shadowy trees and glowing mushrooms. Your guide is a mysterious fox who communicates with you telepathically. The fox leads you through the forest until you reach a clearing surrounded by crystalline pillars that emit bright light. In the center of the clearing stands an ancient tree covered in golden leaves and shiny fruit. The fox explains that this is the Tree of Wisdom, which can grant any wish but comes with a price. You are curious about the price and ask for it. The fox replies: "Your loyalty to me."

You decide to accept the price and make a wish.
