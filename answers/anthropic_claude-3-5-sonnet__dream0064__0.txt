I am dreaming. I find myself walking down a dimly lit corridor, my footsteps echoing against worn marble floors. The walls are painted a soft, healing shade of sage green, and scattered along them are abstract paintings that seem to shift and change when I'm not looking directly at them. The air carries the faint scent of chamomile and lavender.

I push open a heavy wooden door to find a circular room bathed in gentle, golden light streaming through stained glass windows. Twelve chairs are arranged in a perfect circle, each one uniquely different - some plush and velvet, others wooden and weathered, as unique as the souls who occupy them. Most seats are already filled with figures who seem simultaneously solid and translucent, like watercolor paintings coming to life.

As I take my seat in a deep blue armchair that seems to have been waiting just for me, I realize with startling clarity that everyone here is carrying the same invisible weight I've been bearing - we are all Time Collectors, people who can gather and store memories that aren't our own. The burden of holding countless strangers' joys and sorrows has been lonely, but here, finally, are others who understand.

A woman with silver-streaked hair and kind eyes speaks first, and as she does, soft tendrils of colored light drift from her fingertips - she's sharing a memory, and we all instinctively know how to receive it. The room fills with these dancing lights, each one a story, a burden shared and therefore lightened. For the first time, I feel the tightness in my chest beginning to unwind.

The dream pulses with an overwhelming sense of belonging, of finally finding my tribe after walking alone for so long. Tears stream down my face, but they're illuminated with the same golden light that fills the room - tears of relief, of recognition, of coming home.

As we share our stories, the room itself seems to breathe with us, expanding and contracting like a living thing, the stained glass windows creating ever-changing patterns on the floor that mirror our emotional states. We are healing together, this impossible group of memory-keepers, in this impossible room that exists somewhere between reality and dreams.

The dream feels more real than reality itself, and even as I'm aware I'm dreaming, I desperately want to stay in this space of understanding and shared experience, where the weight of collected memories becomes a gift rather than a burden, where loneliness dissolves into belonging.
