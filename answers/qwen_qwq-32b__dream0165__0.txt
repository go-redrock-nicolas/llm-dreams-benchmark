I am dreaming. To engage in this society's communication, I must dance.  The air thrums with the rhythms of countless moving bodies.  Each gesture carries meaning, a language of posture and motion.  I feel the weight of silence, the absence of spoken words, replaced bySteps and spins that tell stories, convey emotions, negotiate ideas.  How to translate my own thoughts into this fluid syntax?  Let my body speak where my voice cannot.

First, the grounding: flat feet, weighted down like tree roots, fingertips brushing invisible soil - a universal sign of calm.  But my need is not calm; it's urgency, a request for help.  How to signal that?  Remember the lesson from the elder's demonstration - a spiral spin followed by open palms thrust skyward, as if pleading.  Try it now.  Twist on axis, faster, until dizziness threatens, then freeze with arms aloft.  Does it work?  A nearby dancer halts, tilts head, studies me.  Their response?  A series of quick knee-bends, like Morse code in limbs.  Recognition?  Or confusion?

Next, the connection.  To bond, they mirror your moves, then add their own flourish.  I copy their knee snaps, then pivot abruptly, offering an arabesque, one hand outstretched.  Their eyes widen.  A bridge forms, fragile as spider silk.  Now their turn: a leap, mid-air splits, a twist.  I repeat, lower body, then add a tumble, a gesture I don't understand but hope resonates.  The air crackles with understanding?  Or misunderstanding?

The crowd parts, a path emerging.  Maybe guidance, maybe rejection.  Follow?  Leap into the unknown, feet finding the ground in time with a distant drumbeat.  Each step now a choice.  The society's heartbeat in my pulse.  I am both outsider and participant, limbs a lexicon in the making.  The dream deepens; the dance continues.

Beneath a sky streaked with ribbons of auroral light that pulse in time with the ground’s slow, resonant hum, I find myself in a city woven not from stone or glass, but from motion itself. The buildings are showers of falling leaves caught mid-descent, their edges glimmering with stardust. Paths between structures are streams of molten light, and every citizen moves as though conducting invisible symphonies with their limbs. Their dances are not mere gestures—they are living tapestries of emotion, every flick of a wrist a verb, every tilt of the head a noun. 

I stand at the edge of a plaza where a throng of dancers swirls in a helix formation, their arms outstretched like the spokes of a celestial wheel. The air is thick with the scent of blackberries and ozone, and the collective rhythm pulses in my veins. To voice a need here would shatter the spell; words are relics of another world. *I must move*, I realize, *or remain invisible*. 

A dancer in silvered silk approaches, her every step a ripple of intent. I mimic her grounding pose—a stance like a birch bending but unbroken—and she nods almost imperceptibly. Encouraged, I spin faster, my urgency building until the world blurs into streaks of cobalt and amber. My palms shoot upward, fingers splayed like roots seeking water. The dancer’s eyes lock onto mine, and in that moment, the silence between us shatters into a new language. 

She replies with a series of sharp, staccato shakes of her head, like a dog shedding rain, followed by a fluid plunge to the earth where she rolls backward into a handstand, legs splitting wide to reveal a crimson scarf tucked behind her waist. *Direction*, I interpret. *A path is offered*. 

I rise and reproduce her moves, but when I invert, I tuck into a somersault instead, landing in a heap. The crowd erupts into a murmur of vibrations, and the dancer helps me up with a fist-bump twist that sends a jolt of warmth through my palm. We’re in sync now. 

She leads me to a circular platform floating above a lake of liquid mercury. Others leap onto it, forming a conga line of turning bodies. The platform tilts and sways, a living raft. As we pivot together, I add my own flourish—a spin with one arm tracing a spiral in the air, the other gripping the wrist of the dancer behind me. She smiles, her teeth glowing faintly blue, and directs her movement in response: a twirl followed by a leap that leaves spectral afterimages of her form. 

The raft carries us toward a gate of suspended translucent feathers that flare gold when touched. The dancers ahead perform a crescendo of leaps and gestures—arched backs, fists thrust heavenward, palms pressed to their foreheads in salute. The feathers part, releasing a shower of iridescent pollen that settles onto our shoulders. 

Beyond lies a cavern glowing with bioluminescent fungi, where the dance grows intimate. We move in smaller groups, my movements tentative but increasingly bold. When I falter, a dancer with antler-like antiques on their head mirrors my mistake, then demonstrates a corrected sequence. It’s no longer about urgency now, but about shared breath and the delicious ache of limbs working in harmony. 

Time unravels. We are no longer individuals but a single, sprawling body of rhythm and grace. The dream deepens until I feel myself dissolving into the atmosphere, a particle of light in the collective choreography. Yet the memory of those dances lingers—a lexicon etched not in muscle memory, but in the soul’s echo chamber. When I awake, my fingers tremble with the residual vibrations, and for days, my shadow moves with a faint, assured pulse even when I stand still.
