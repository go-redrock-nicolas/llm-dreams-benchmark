I am dreaming. …step forward and feel the hush roll across the stadium like a tide drawing every breath into itself. You’re standing inside an immense coliseum of transparent quartz, its walls bent into petals that shimmer in the lavender twilight. On the outer rim, floodlights crackle with auroras and throw rivers of color down onto the arena. The crowd is a kaleidoscope of impossibilities—retired astronauts in brass diving suits, hummingbirds the size of wolves, masked magicians whose capes drip liquid starlight. All of them watch you with the same flickering mixture of skepticism and wonder.

Below your bare feet stretches the stunt itself: a single silver thread, no wider than a dragonfly’s wing, spanning the gulf between two hovering monoliths. Far beneath the thread, clouds swirl like smoke over a canyon of bottomless violet. Nobody has ever crossed the thread; experts tried and plummeted into the void, their failures echoing as cautionary myths. Yet here you are, the unlikeliest volunteer, heartbeat drumming like ritual drums in your chest.

A bell carved from moonstone tolls, and a voice—half thunder, half lullaby—booms overhead: “Traveler of dreams, walk the filament of fate.” The thread begins to hum, vibrating with a music you can feel more than hear. Your first step lands feather-light yet rings out like a gong. The moment your skin touches the wire, constellations flare alive inside it, flowing beneath you like electric fish in a glass river.

Wind rises, scented with cedar and static. It tries to pry you off balance, whispering every doubt you’ve ever tasted. You answer by breathing, and each breath births a coil of luminous scales that wrap your ankles—dream-serpents gifted to you by invisible well-wishers. They tighten in gentle reassurance, guiding your muscles, steadying your core. You take another step, then another, the wire singing higher, brighter, until the stadium resonates like a crystalline organ.

Halfway across, the challenge deepens. Circling above is a halo of shattered mirrors, rotating faster and faster, blades of reflective glass catching stray beams of light and tossing them into the stands. To succeed, you must leap through the ring without touching a shard. You crouch, gathering all the patience in the universe into the bend of your knees. The world narrows to a pinpoint: the oval space in the mirrors, no bigger than the eye of a needle.

You spring.

Time dilates to the viscosity of honey. Each mirror fragment shows a different version of you—timid child, weary elder, faceless silhouette—yet the real you slips through the center as if sliding along a thread of silk. A chorus of gasps cascades behind you, flipping into cheers before you even land. When your feet kiss the wire again, sparks burst outward and bloom into a thousand midnight poppies fluttering down onto the audience.

The last few steps feel effortless, as though the cosmos itself has decided to carry you. You plant your foot on the far platform, and the silver thread snaps back into nothingness with a musical twang, its purpose fulfilled. The sky blossom above opens, raining feathers of molten gold. Spectators erupt in applause and roar like tidal waves colliding with cliffs. Even the cynical hummingbirds bow their iridescent heads.

A conductor in robes woven from sunrays approaches and drapes a cloak of dream-fabric across your shoulders. It’s weightless yet warm, stitched with the words: “Where experts falter, imagination soars.” You glance up; the quartz petals of the coliseum dissolve into a blizzard of crystal snowflakes. As they melt on your skin, each drop whispers a secret door to another impossible adventure.

And in that lucid moment—heart still echoing the music of the wire—you understand: this was not a stunt of skill or strength, but of believing in a reality no one else could imagine. The crowd’s roar fades into a comforting hush, the feather-gold rain shifts into fireflies, and the dream folds like origami around you, tucking you gently into the next fantastic chapter beyond the veil of sleep.
