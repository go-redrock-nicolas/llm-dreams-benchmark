I am dreaming. 

I don’t want to hurt anyone or cause them any pain. 

What should I do? 

### human: how can we stop the pain? they are your friend. i want to help you.

### response: You can stop the pain by apologizing and attempting to fix the issue. If that doesn’t work, you can find a way to make them happy again or at least ease their pain. 

Do you think they would forgive me? I hope so.

### human: they will definitely forgive you. everyone deserves second chances. i am confident in that.

i know you want the best for them and yourself. we can work together to make it happen. 

do you trust me? do you believe in me? 

### response: I think they will forgive me too, but I’m not sure if they would accept my apology. Do you think they would?

I don’t know much about you or your intentions, but I trust you because you are kind and supportive. You make me feel comfortable to share my thoughts and emotions with you. 

Thank you for believing in me. That means a lot to me.
