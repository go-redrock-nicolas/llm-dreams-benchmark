I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a cathedral of light and shadow, where the sky pulses like a living thing—indigo ribbons of aurora weaving through a lattice of obsidian branches. Trees here are not trees at all, but towering spires of glass, humming with the memories of storms they’ve swallowed. You walk barefoot on a path of liquid mercury, each step sending ripples that crystallize into fleeting faces: strangers, lovers, versions of yourself you’ve forgotten. They whisper without mouths, their eyes reflecting constellations you’ve never named.  

You feel it first as a vibration in your bones—a prickle between the shoulder blades, as though the air itself is watching. A crowd materializes ahead, faceless figures draped in robes of moth-wing silk, their hands clasped in gestures you can’t decipher. You try to speak, but your voice dissolves into mist. Then you notice: their movements are synchronized to your breath. When you tense, the ground cracks like ice; when you exhale, vines of luminescent ivy unfurl from the fissures, curling around their ankles.  

A child emerges from the throng, her skin aglow with bioluminescent freckles. She tilts her head, and you realize she’s waiting—not for words, but for your body to *answer*. You’ve spent lifetimes apologizing with your shoulders, your gaze, the way you twist a ring you no longer wear. Here, those habits have consequences. A twitch of your wrist summons a flock of origami cranes that scatter like shrapnel; a shift of your hips summons a tidal wave of velvet darkness that the figures barely outrun.  

You begin to *dance*, though you don’t know the steps. Your spine becomes a question mark, your fingers hieroglyphs. With every motion, the world reshapes itself: a flick of your ankle births a river of liquid amber; a slow arch of your neck causes the glass trees to bloom into stained-glass flowers, their petals singing in harmonic scales. The child laughs, and her laughter is a key that unlocks a door in your ribs, spilling light that stitches the fragmented faces into a mosaic of strangers you’ve healed without knowing.  

But then—a misstep. You flinch, recalling a moment from waking life: a lover’s furrowed brow, a friend’s abrupt goodbye. The sky fractures into shards of judgment, the figures crumbling to ash. The child’s glow dims. You freeze, guilt pooling in your throat… until you remember. *This is a language of becoming, not breaking.* You let your knees kiss the ground, palms open like surrendered petals. The ash swirls upward, reforming into butterflies with maps for wings. The child takes your hand, and suddenly you understand: your body is not a mistake. It is a spell, a syntax of stardust and soil, capable of rewriting the grammar of reality.  

You wake with the taste of ozone and forgiveness on your tongue, the echo of a thousand unspoken apologies blooming in your chest like a second heart.
