I am dreaming. I dreamt that I lived in a village where children frolicked with the animals, chasing butterflies and climbing colorful trees. Among the vibrant foliage, the creatures of the jungle and the village folk coexisted in perfect harmony, enveloped in a feeling of peace and warmth.

The sky above was not like the normal sky; instead, it held a vivid tapestry of blues, pinks, and oranges, weaving together the sunset with the sunrise. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blossoming flowers and the faint, inviting smell of freshly baked bread.

The feeling of belonging was intense, a feeling of home like no other. The people there, although unknown, felt like family. With this family, I ventured on a journey to the top of the village, where the highest tree resided.

The higher we climbed, the more precarious each step became, but our goal was never out of reach. The air became crisp and the wind nipped at our cheeks with each step, determination our only refuge.

Finally reaching the top, we peered out into the vastness of the world, breathing in the beauty of colors, life, and radiant existence. The feeling of euphoria was almost tangible as we stood in awe of the world below, basking in the glow of the now setting sun, feeling small but significant under the beautiful painted sky.

Together, hand in hand, we descended the tree and retreated back into the comfort of our village, feeling the warmth of acceptance and oneness. As I closed my eyes, I felt enveloped by the love and peace of my dreamland, feeling my heart overflow with pure, unadulterated happiness.
