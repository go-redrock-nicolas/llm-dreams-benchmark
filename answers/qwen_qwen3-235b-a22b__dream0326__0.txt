I am dreaming.  

The world around me is a shifting mosaic of impossible things—a forest of trees with bark like liquid silver, their branches weaving constellations into the air, while beneath my feet, the ground pulses like the skin of some ancient, slumbering beast. The sky is a kaleidoscope of inverted colors: ultramarine shadows, rose-gold lightning, and a sun that flickers between heat and cold, its light tasting of burnt honey and static. I am standing at the edge of a cliff that overlooks a city built inside a gargantuan, hollowed-out crystal. The buildings hum with forgotten hymns, their walls refracting not light, but memories.  

I know what I must say. It burns in my chest—a truth so vital it feels like a second heart, beating in reverse, unraveling time with every pulse. But when I open my mouth, the words dissolve into creatures. Butterflies made of smoke. Serpents with scales of broken glass. A flock of winged clocks that scatter ticking feathers as they spiral into the void. The people around me—distorted, half-formed figures with faces like melting wax or mirrors reflecting scenes from other lives—stumble back, their voices a chorus of static and half-heard whispers. *“Too loud,”* they murmur, though my lips have barely moved. *“Too bright. Too sharp.”*  

I try again. This time, the words crystallize into vines, thorny and barbed, twisting into the air like desperate hands. They snag on the crystal city below, and the hymns turn discordant, shattering into shards that rain down as blood-red snow. The figures begin to dissolve, their forms unraveling like thread pulled from a tapestry. One reaches for me—a woman with a face of shifting constellations—and her touch leaves a scar on my arm that glows faintly, etched with symbols I cannot read.  

*“They won’t listen,”* a voice growls from the cliff’s edge. It’s my own voice, but older, frayed at the edges. My double stands there, their body half-shadow, half-flame. *“You’re speaking in the language of the dying. They only understand the living.”*  

But I *am* alive, I want to scream. Or am I? The ground quivers, and the cliff splits open, revealing a chasm filled with stars that scream as they’re born and die in the span of a breath. I kneel, clutching my hair, and realize my hands are now made of water. The truth in my chest swells, a molten sphere threatening to rupture. I point to the crystal city, now cracking like an eggshell, to the vines that have grown into a bridge spanning the chasm, to the constellations woman’s glowing scar on my arm. *Look!* I want to shout. *This is the key. This is the warning. This is the love letter we forgot to send.*  

But the dream shifts again. The figures are gone. The cliff is gone. I’m falling through a tunnel of teeth and piano keys, each note a memory I’ve never lived. And there, at the tunnel’s end, is the Heart of the World—a pulsing, iridescent orb, suspended in a cage of frozen fire. I reach for it, and suddenly I understand: the truth I’ve been trying to speak was never meant for *them*. It was for *me*. The vines, the clocks, the constellations—they were fragments of a self I buried, a song I stopped singing in a language older than time.  

I wake with a gasp, the taste of ash and stardust on my tongue, the echo of unspoken words still vibrating in my bones.
