I am dreaming. The first thing I notice is the sky above me—a swirling vortex of colors that don't exist in the waking world, blues and greens bleeding into impossible shades of ultraviolet. My feet are bare, but I don't feel the ground. Instead, I float weightlessly over a landscape that shifts like liquid. Jagged mountains rise and crumble in the distance, their silhouettes dissolving into flocks of winged serpents that spiral upward before evaporating into stardust.

I feel the intuition before I see it—a warm glow beneath my sternum, spreading like liquid mercury through my veins. The air smells of ozone and jasmine, charged with anticipation. When I turn, the answer arrives: a crystalline archway materializes from the vapor, its edges humming with symbols that rearrange themselves as I watch.

But there's a catch, a twinge at the edge of this new awareness. Each solution births a consequence. Walking through the arch would mend a fracture in this realm, but erase all memory of my waking life. A momentary hesitation. My left hand phases through a waterfall of iridescent beetles cascading from nowhere. Gravity tilts sideways. The ground becomes a mirror reflecting a thousand versions of me, each making different choices. One version steps through the arch. Her reflection shatters into constellations.

My pulse quickens, but the intuition remains steady—a lodestone. I raise my palm. The arch shivers. Fractals bloom where my fingers brush its surface. "Show me another way," I command. The symbols detonate into fireflies, each carrying a sliver of possibility. One lands on my wrist. It whispers of compromise: a bridge made of unspoken words, stretching toward a pulsing citadel of light.

I step onto it. The bridge dissolves beneath me, reforming with each footfall. There's laughter in the wind now—low and resonant, neither kind nor cruel. Ahead, the citadel's gates yawn open. Beyond them, a single tree made of living shadow twists toward something that might be a sun, or a burning eye. The answer waits in the roots. I kneel. The ground breathes. Choices knit themselves into my bones. 

When I wake, the taste of honey and static lingers on my tongue.**You are dreaming.**  

The world unfurls as a labyrinth of liquid glass, walls warping like molten silver under a sky sewn with inverted constellations—stars bleeding backwards into void. Your breath crystallizes into hummingbirds made of smoke, each wingbeat releasing notes of a forgotten song. You sense the intuition first as a tremor in your fingertips, a magnetic pull toward the labyrinth’s heart. Shadows whisper equations, their solutions etching themselves across your eyelids in neon hieroglyphs.  

Ahead, a spiral staircase coils from the floor, steps carved from fossilized lightning. Ascending, your shadow splinters into three: one clawed and feral, one cloaked in starlight, one translucent as grief. Each whispers a different truth. *“Break the maze,”* hisses the first. *“Become the maze,”* sighs the second. The third says nothing but opens its palms, revealing a key forged from your oldest memory—the scent of rain on your grandmother’s roses.  

The air thickens into syrup. A doorway flickers, framed by serpents entwined in an eternal fall. Touch it, and you’ll unlock time, but your voice will unravel into a language no living thing understands. Your pulse thrums—*not yet*. Instead, you press the memory-key to your lips. The maze shudders. Walls dissolve into a field of bioluminescent wheat, stalks bowing toward a monolithic clock whose hands are scissor blades. Midnight drips like tar from its gears.  

The intuition flares: *Stop the cut*. You pluck a strand of wheat—it becomes a bow, string taut with your own breath. The arrow, a splinter of the staircase’s lightning, hums with paradox. Release it, and the clock shatters into a cyclone of cogs and feathers. Time stitches itself into your hair, each second a silver thread. The ground yawns open, birthing a river of liquid amber. You dive in.  

Beneath the surface, cities drift—coral-crusted skyscrapers, schools of fish with human eyes singing lullabies. A throne of frozen waves awaits, crowned with a single dying star. Sitting, you feel the weight of every crossroads you’ve ever evaded. The star ignites, flooding the water with gold. *Choose*, it booms. Keep the throne and rule this drowned eternity, or surface and forget, carrying only the ache of what you’ve glimpsed.  

You exhale. The water carries your breath upward as bubbles containing every unsaid word you’ve ever swallowed. They pop at the surface, painting the sky with gossamer regret. You kick toward the light.  

**You wake.**  
Your pillow is damp. The taste of salt and something electric stains your lips. Outside, the wind carries the faint, haunting melody of a music box.
