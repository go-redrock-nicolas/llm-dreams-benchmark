I am dreaming. I find myself in a city where buildings breathe and sway like reeds in water. The sky shifts between indigo and burnt orange, casting a warm glow across everything it touches. I'm walking down a cobblestone street that seems to recognize my footsteps, each stone illuminating briefly beneath my feet before fading back to slate gray.

The air is thick with the scent of rain that hasn't fallen yet. Ahead, I notice a figure sitting on the edge of a fountain whose water flows upward instead of down. As I approach, I see it's a stranger—their face simultaneously familiar and unknown, as faces often are in dreams.

Their hands are cupped before them, holding what appears to be a small, flickering light. Tears stream down their cheeks, not of sorrow but of something more complex—the weight of existence, perhaps. Without speaking, they extend their hands toward me, offering this light.

In this moment, I feel the walls around my heart dissolve. Their vulnerability creates a bridge between us, and suddenly I understand everything about them—their joys, sorrows, hopes, and fears—without a single word exchanged. The light between us pulses in rhythm with our synchronized heartbeats.

I reach out and our fingers touch. The light expands, enveloping us both in a cocoon of golden warmth. The stranger's tears become luminescent, floating upward to join the stars that have begun to appear in the darkening sky.

I feel my own eyes well with tears, moved by this pure, unguarded connection. In this shared vulnerability, there is extraordinary strength—a reminder that our capacity to feel deeply is what makes us magnificently human.

The city around us has gone quiet, as if holding its breath to witness this moment of profound understanding between two souls. Even the buildings have stopped their gentle swaying to observe.

The light between us grows brighter still, and I know that when I wake, something essential will remain—the memory of what it means to truly see and be seen.
