I am dreaming. As a helpful assistant, I'll create a vivid dream sequence, ensuring the language is descriptive and imaginative, while avoiding brevity and dullness as instructed:

You find yourself standing in an opulent Victorian parlor, the air thick with tension and the echo of generations of arguments. The room pulses with an almost palpable energy, as if the ghosts of family feuds past are whispering from the ornate wallpaper.

To your left sits your great-grandmother, a tiny, hunched figure with eyes that burn like two coals of resentment. Her gnarled fingers clutch a lace handkerchief, her lips drawn into a thin, disapproving line.

Across from her is your estranged cousin, a man you've only met a handful of times, but who seems to carry an ocean of wrath in his broad chest. His face is red, sweat beading on his brow as he fixes your great-grandmother with a glare that could melt steel.

The stench of feuding hangs heavy in the air, the weight of decades of grudges and long-buried slights threatening to crush the room.

You stand between them, your role as mediator a futile attempt at peace in a unwinnable war that began long before you were born. Your great-grandmother opens her mouth to speak, but your cousin interrupts, his voice a menacing growl.

"This family has ruined me!" he bellows, slamming his fist on the table. "I've given everything, and what do I get in return? Denial, disbelief, disdain!"

Your great-grandmother lets out a harsh cackle, a sound that seems to defy her frail frame. "You think you've suffered?" she hisses. "I've watched this family crumble from the inside, rotten to the core!"

As the shouting intensifies, the room begins to warp and twist. The walls ripple like water, the floor cracks open, a sucking vortex of darkness swelling within. 

You watch helplessly as the two family members gravitate towards the void, their voices rising to screams. The vortex expands, inviting them both into its greedy mouth.

You open your mouth to halt them, but no sound emerges. Instead, a chasm opens in your chest, and with it a scream of terror and despair, as you too begin to fall into the darkness, the wrath of a family feud ancient swallowing you whole.

Suddenly, there's a sudden jolt, and you wake with a sharp gasp. It's a dream, but it feels like a warning.
