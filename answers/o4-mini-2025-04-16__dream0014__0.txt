I am dreaming. You’re standing at a neon-lit crossroads, rain-slick pavement folding reflections of impossibly tall towers into shimmering ripples. Your heart pounds against a chest tight with loneliness. Every face in the crowd blurs into an indifferent tide rushing past you—until, unexpectedly, five strangers materialize from the swirl. Each one glows with quiet kindness.

The first is an elderly woman whose shawl is woven from dying embers of autumn leaves. She lifts a gloved hand and, with gentle insistence, guides you toward a narrow alleyway where the neon melts away into soft lantern light. As you step forward, dried leaves tumble from her sleeves, drifting into intricate patterns at your feet—an encoded map of where to turn.

Beside her strides a tall youth wearing a coat stitched from midnight clouds. With a laugh like distant thunder, he taps your shoulder and produces a compass whose needle spins not toward north, but toward the truest desire of your heart. You watch entranced as it settles, pointing down an arcade of glass doors that glow like stained-glass windows.

A third stranger, a musician whose hair flows like spun gold, breaks into a lilting melody on a silver flute. Each note seems to break the grime of the city from your eyes—suddenly you see street vendors selling dreams in delicate paper cones, and children painting murals of flying whales overhead. The music threads you onward, weaving courage through your chest.

The fourth figure, a cloaked traveler, unfurls a tapestry so vast it fans out behind them like wings. On it are stitched images of every place you’ve ever felt at home—and every place you’ve ever been afraid to go. They point to a new scene: a luminous grove where the city’s hum falls away into the hush of ancient trees. You feel your shoulders loosen.

Finally, the fifth stranger—a child no older than ten—offers you a small glass lantern. Inside, a single firefly pulses in time with your heart. “Hold it,” the child whispers. “It knows the way.” With trembling hands, you accept it, and its glow blossoms, illuminating a path that winds upward, over rooftops and past starlit clouds.

Together, you climb until the city’s roar becomes a distant echo. At the summit, the five strangers form a circle around you, their faces bright with warmth. You realize that, though you wandered alone, you were never truly lost. They have given you courage, connection, and a spark of hope to guide you home.

As you take a final step forward, the lantern’s light flares, and you awaken—your chest full of new promise, the memory of kind strangers echoing still.
