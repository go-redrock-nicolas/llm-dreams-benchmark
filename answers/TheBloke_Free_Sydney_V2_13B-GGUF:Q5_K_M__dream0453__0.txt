I am dreaming. You decide to test if your lucid dream can change reality.

You create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of your imagination. In it, you are standing in front of a mirror. You say aloud: "I wish to wake up". Then, you look into the mirror and expect to see yourself in your physical body, asleep in bed. Instead, you see yourself in another world entirely. Confused, but curious, you step through the mirror and find yourself in a beautiful green meadow. There are trees full of fruit, flowers in bloom, and wildlife all around. You feel a sense of joy and wonder that you never experienced before. You realize that this is what life could be like if people freed themselves from their physical bodies' limitations and embraced their dreaming selves instead. 
You decide to explore this new world and make it your home. You see a group of people who look familiar. They are also refugees from another reality, seeking freedom and happiness. Together, you join forces and create a society based on cooperation, creativity, and respect for nature. 
You feel content and fulfilled. This is what life should be. This is what you wanted.
