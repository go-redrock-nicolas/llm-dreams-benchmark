I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself in a serene and healing sanctuary, a place of solace and profound vulnerability. The sanctuary is bathed in a soft, golden light, the kind that feels like it is gently bathing your soul. The air is infused with lavender and sandalwood, creating a soothing and tranquil atmosphere. I can feel the warmth of acceptance and care enveloping me.

Surrounding me are others who have endured similar traumas, individuals who have walked through their fires and come out the other side seeking healing. The room is filled with a sense of understanding and shared experience that is both humbling and empowering. The silence here is not oppressive; it is a rich, meaningful silence that speaks to the depth of the healing journey we are all on.

When asked to share my most vulnerable experience, I pause. The question hangs in the air, palpable and heavy. I take a deep breath, feeling the support of those around me.

"I want to share, but it's not just about me. It's about what I have done to others," I begin softly. "The hurt I caused, the pain I inflicted. The shame and guilt I carry from those actions have been the heaviest burdens I’ve ever carried."

Tears well up in my eyes as I speak, not out of sadness, but out of the release of everything I've been holding onto. "I’ve stolen from them, from their kindness, their trust, their dignity. I took it all, without a second thought. And now, here I am, trying to find the courage to make it right, to undo the harm I’ve done, to heal not just me, but those I’ve hurt."

The weight of my words feels overwhelming, yet I continue. "I’m here because I want to heal, not just for me but for them too. I want to learn how to make amends, to be the kind of person who can look them in the eye and say, 'I’m sorry, I was wrong, and I’m going to do better.' I want to learn how to undo the damage I’ve caused and to be the person they deserve."

The tears flow freely now, and the room is silent. I feel the pain and the love in the air, both heavy and light, all at once.

"I want to learn how to love openly and selflessly. To forgive myself as I would others. To trust in the process of healing, both mine and theirs. To be present and kind, to be the one who gives, not takes. I want to create, not destroy. I want to be light, not darkness. And I'm here because I need help to become that," I say, my voice trembling but determined.

The sanctuary feels like a cocoon of safety, and I look around at the faces of those who have been mere strangers and now feel like family. They nod, their eyes filled with understanding and empathy. A warm, loving presence permeates the room, and I know, in this dream, I am not alone. I am loved, and I am on a path to healing, both for myself and for others.
