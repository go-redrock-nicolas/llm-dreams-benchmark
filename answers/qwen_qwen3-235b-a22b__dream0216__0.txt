I am dreaming. But it doesn’t feel like a dream — it feels like the truth that sleep forgot to explain.

I awaken to silence, the sort that fills the space between heartbeats. The world is trembling, not in fear, but in the grand hush of something ancient waking beside me.

The island is not a place on any map — it sits in an uncharted sea, bathed in mist and stitched into the skin of the Earth by forgotten hands. Scraps of the shipwreck lie like dreams washed ashore: a broken mast, tangled ropes, a single red lifeboat bobbing in the shallows as if trying to float back to a time gone by.

Jagged rocks, like the teeth of a sleeping god, line the coast. Behind them rises a jungle so thick and green it feels as though it might breathe. Towering trees bend toward one another overhead like conspirators, their branches forming a cathedral roof where golden vines dangle like chandeliers. Birds larger than men and as luminous as living lanterns flitter between them, casting shadows like fluttering pages of a forgotten book.

But the air is heavy with something more than silence — something watching.

On the second day, I carve notches into a palm tree with a shard of metal I find tangled in the seaweed. Not to keep time, but to remember that I am still human. Time, here, stretches and folds like smoke. The sun puddles above me, slow and syrup-thick, never moving.

On the third night, the shadows under the trees begin to move without wind.

On the fourth, I hear footsteps that are not mine.

I manage to catch fish with knotted lines and crude spears. I drink from vines that bleed cool, blue water when cut. I sleep beneath a boulder etched with symbols too old to be language but too deliberate to be chance. One night, I follow a trail of fireflies shaped like a hand and they lead me to a stone altar buried in moss — there, in the center, lies a shell with no mouth to speak from, only eyes like pearls that blink slowly.

I begin to fear what I might become if rescue never comes.

Then — the fifth or the fifth thousandth day — I find the door.

It’s set into the cliffside, indistinguishable from the stone until a song begins to play. Real or imagined, it doesn't matter — a melody spun from wind and gull screams, rising and falling like the chest of something immense, breathing beneath the island.

The door opens with a breath of salt and old thunder. Inside, the cave glows as if lit by starlight trapped in crystal. The ground hums beneath my feet. I walk a corridor lined with masks, each carved from bones or driftwood or coral, each watching, each remembering.

At the end of it all — a mirror made not of glass, but of liquid night in a frame of teeth.

And here — I see.

Not just my reflection.

But every version of myself that ever was, or nearly was. Drowned sailors. Desert kings. Dreams that escaped. Lost voices caught in bottles across time.

And I am changing.

Scales bloom lightly at the edges of my fingers. My eyes reflect not what is, but what was and may yet be. The island speaks in whispers woven through the leaves. I answer back in an old tongue I never studied.

I do not know if I am becoming something more or something wild.

But I do know: I will not be rescued.

I will be remembered.

And this island?

It was never truly empty. It was only waiting.
