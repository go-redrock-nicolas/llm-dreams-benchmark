I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, circular library that stretches impossibly upward and downward, bookshelves spiraling into infinity. Each leather-bound tome bears my name in gilt lettering, though the subtitles differ—stories I've told myself about who I am. The air smells of parchment and possibility, with motes of golden dust dancing in shafts of light from unseen windows.

A book glows at eye level, drawing me closer. The pages chronicle a narrative I've recited since childhood: "I am the cautious one, the planner who cannot leap without certainty." The words pulse with familiarity—this belief has been my anchor, my excuse, my prison for decades.

As my fingers trace the text, the ink begins to dissolve, leaving trails of iridescent liquid that drips through my fingers, staining them with constellation patterns. The emptying pages don't feel like loss but liberation.

Behind me, I hear the sound of rushing water. Turning, I discover the library has transformed—now half the circular chamber is a cascading waterfall fed by the dissolving stories. Where the water meets the floor, lush gardens bloom spontaneously, plants I've never seen with blossoms that emit gentle music when they open.

A mirror forms in the waterfall's surface. My reflection shows not my familiar self, but something more luminous and undefined—my edges blurring into potential rather than certainty. My chest opens like a door to release a flock of paper birds that scatter upward, carrying fragments of that old story away.

"You were never just the cautious one," whispers a voice from everywhere and nowhere. "That was just the first draft."

I step toward the waterfall, understanding that to pass through means leaving that old definition behind. The water isn't cold as I expected, but warm like recognition. As I emerge on the other side, my body feels lighter, reconfigured, newly authored.

I am becoming.
