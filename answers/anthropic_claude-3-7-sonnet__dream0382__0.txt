I am dreaming. # Threshold Crossing

I'm standing at the edge of a vast glass plateau suspended impossibly in an amber sky. The air tastes like cinnamon and distant thunderstorms. Below me, cities rise and fall in time-lapse—metropolises blooming like crystalline flowers, then dissolving back into earth and stardust.

I feel a profound ambivalence tugging at my core. Something fundamental is shifting. The ground beneath my feet begins to transform, becoming translucent, revealing layers of my past decisions stacked like geological strata.

A door materializes before me—ornate and ancient, its wood grain telling stories in a language I somehow understand without words. Opening it means leaving something essential behind, yet I'm drawn to it with magnetic inevitability.

Wind chimes sound from nowhere and everywhere, playing melodies that remind me of conversations I haven't yet had with people I've known all my life.

My hand reaches for the doorknob—cool brass that pulses like a living thing. Through the keyhole seeps a light that contains colors I've never seen before, colors that shouldn't exist.

I'm terrified. I'm exhilarated. I'm mourning. I'm celebrating.

The door swings open without my touch, revealing not a place but a possibility—a shimmering potential that waits for my decision to crystallize it into reality.

I step forward, simultaneously falling and ascending, the contradiction feeling like the only truth I've ever known.
