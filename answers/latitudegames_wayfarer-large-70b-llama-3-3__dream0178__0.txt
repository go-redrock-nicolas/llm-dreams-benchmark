I am dreaming. I am standing in a grand cathedral for a somber wedding ceremony. The mood is heavy with tension as two reluctant souls prepare to pledge eternal vows. The bride-to-be clutches her bouquet so tightly her knuckles have turned white, while the groom's eyes dart frantically side to side. Nervous energy crackles through the crowd.

Suddenly, something shifts inside me. The contrast between my internal turmoil and the stifling formality around me sparks a silent chuckle deep in my chest. I try desperately to smother it, but like a malevolent entity, the urge to laugh grows stronger. My shoulders begin to shake imperceptibly as I fight to maintain a straight face.

The priest drones on with eulogies of doomed love while my mirth threatens to erupt. I squeeze my eyes shut, pinching my lips together and willing myself to take steady breaths. The harder I struggle to suppress my amusement, the more powerful it becomes. My feet start to tingle as I imagine the looks on everyone's faces if I burst out laughing right now.

The bride glances at me sharply, and a few guests nearby look confused by my quivering shoulders. Beads of sweat form on my forehead as I battle against my rebellious sense of humor. It's like trying to hold back a burst dam - I can feel it building and building, threatening to upend this entire solemn occasion with an inappropriate outburst.

I shift my weight from foot to foot, desperately hoping to stave off the growing imperative to laugh. My lungs feel ready to burst as I hold my breath, my face contorted in a frantic attempt at maintaining a somber expression. All it would take is one tiny crack in my composure for the floodgates to open completely.
