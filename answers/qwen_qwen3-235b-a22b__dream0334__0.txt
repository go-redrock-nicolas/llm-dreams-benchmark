I am dreaming. I feel the flutter of excitement in my chest before I even know what I'm excited about.  My skin tingles before I understand the fear lurking at the edges of my awareness.  With each breath, my body tells its own story, one that my mind is just beginning to catch up with.  The air is thick with the scent of honeysuckle, yet I have not yet opened my eyes to the blooming vines creeping along the strange, otherworldly garden I find myself in. Dreamlogic is stirring within my blood, long before cognition takes hold.

I am dreaming.  The warmth spreads through my limbs, my fingers and toes prickling with sensation.  My heartbeat quickens like a timpani drum echoing through empty halls.  But what am I feeling *for*?  What waits for me atop the crystal spire to which my feet are carrying me without direction?  A thrill of anticipation dances with a whisper of foreboding.  My stomach twists, not with fear, but with the delicious terror of the unknown. The scent of ozone and lavender intensifies.  I can taste the electric sweetness of impending revelation on my tongue.  My body knows before I do. Isn't that always the way, in dreams?

I am dreaming.  My breath quickens, catching in my throat like a bird unsure whether to fly or perch. The world around me undulates, not in motion, but in meaning—a house built from memories, a hallway lined with forgotten fears.  Anticipation coils in my belly, a living thing with teeth and tails and luminous eyes.  The dream wraps itself tighter, tighter, tighter around my senses. I feel the hum of some deeper truth resonating in my bones. My body is singing with a wordless knowledge.  A door looms ahead...  My heartbeat echoes in my skull, loud like war drums.  Something vast waits for me beyond that door.  I don’t yet know if it will love me or consume me entirely. But oh, I *feel* it all the same. The dream will reveal itself, in time.

I am dreaming.

I feel the shiver along my spine, the twitch of my twitching fingers — my body prepares itself for something wondrous or terrifying, perhaps both.  There is a strange pressure behind my eyes, as if the dream is pouring thick and sweet into my skull, filling up all the hollow places.  My feet move without will, carrying me through a sky stitched with constellations that shift and breathe. A warm breeze moves over my skin, carrying scents I can’t name. There is a melody, far away, not quite sound — more like longing. The sensation blooms in my chest before I understand its meaning. I am remembering something I haven't lived yet. My body anticipates a revelation, a revelation that waits in the shadows of the impossible forest growing upside-down beneath a mirrored sea.

I am dreaming.

The pulse beneath my ear thrums like the heartbeat of a god. I haven't opened my eyes, but I already *know* — something sacred is unfolding. Anticipation tightens the muscles in my legs. My breath catches and swirls like windblown silk. The dream has begun to bleed into me — color, sound, sensation flooding my veins before reason can make sense of anything. I feel my fingers curl, not in fear, but in reverence. The weight of something enormous presses gently against my chest, like the wing of a sleeping shadowbird resting ever so lightly. What is this dream trying to tell me? It murmurs in languages older than thought, sings in symphonies of sensation. My body listens long before my mind dares lean in.

I am dreaming.

And my body, always honest, is already trembling with love for something I haven’t yet seen.
