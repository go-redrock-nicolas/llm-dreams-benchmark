I am dreaming. The city is dark, and the moon is silver and sharp above, dangling like a blade ready to cut through the skin of the world. I walk through narrow alleys where faces blur like smoke and voices echo in broken fragments against the brick. This city is old — too old, steeped in the bitterness of time, rotted in its bones like forgotten fruit. But it's alive — thrumming with heat, aching with want. I can feel it in my chest, in the hollow of my throat like the echo of a scream not yet born.

Here, power leaks like gas from broken pipes underfoot. It's almost palpable; a tremble in the air. The people here — the watchers, the hiders, the silent conspirators — they don’t bow easily. They've survived too long in the dusk, danced too long with shadows. But I've been here before — in dreams like this, or in something not far from dreams. I **know** they must be made to yield. Not through reason, nor pleas. But by **presence**. By **force of self**.

I inhale, and the city breathes with me.

With every step forward, the dreamscape adjusts itself — like a living mural bending under invisible fingers. I tower now, subtle and sleek — a shadow swathed in obsidian armor, eyes glowing with the fire of embers not yet dead. My voice becomes colder, every syllable re-shaped into stone behind my teeth. I’m not threatening through words alone — I’m **threat** itself, an unspoken promise painted in glimmering silence.

They see it first in the way I **stand** — unconsciously coiled, predatory, like a jungle cat ready to land without sound or mercy. My voice, when it comes, is a sting wrapped in silk — a threat played like a low note on a violin no one knows how to play anymore. I **don't ask** them to obey. I offer them a decision: to submit or to defy.

And those who defy — well, in dreams, I can **play god**.

One clenched fist and the air begins to press — thick like stormwater, dense as nightfall. Buildings seem to lean closer, to watch. Some freeze, paralyzed in bone-heavy fear, too aware that I dominate not just **space**, but **psychology**. I don’t need violence; I command it like thunder before lightning. The sharp edges of imagined power slice through their defenses as easily as a knife cuts fog.

This dream is **calculated**, like all good manipulation is. It's a ballet of fear and control. Every motion, every glance carefully designed to send the message that I’m not **to be challenged**, not because of brute strength, but because I know **when** to be strong, **how** to break balance, when to crumple resistance like paper without ever losing my calm.

In dream logic, **control radiates** from me like a pulse. As if the universe itself bows to the choreography I've selected.

But there's something more than fear in me here. Beneath the armor, beneath the steel eyes and dangerous silence, there’s a **hollowness**. A question in the pit of my being — *was this necessary?* Because in dreaming, the mind doesn’t hide from consequences. It remembers the weight of choices even when you don’t face them yet.

I walk out of the alley into flickering neon, the rain beginning to kiss the cracked pavements. The city diminishes behind me like a sleeper’s sigh, fading to the pale gray of morning. And I, the strategist of shadows, am left with the echo of my actions — vibrating like... a dream half-remembered, and far too sharp to forget.
