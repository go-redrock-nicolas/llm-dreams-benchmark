I am dreaming. You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak.

Your words are powerful, your voice is strong, and your presence is captivating. The audience is listening intently, and they are hanging on every word that comes out of your mouth. 

You feel confident, you feel empowered, and you feel amazing. You continue to speak.
