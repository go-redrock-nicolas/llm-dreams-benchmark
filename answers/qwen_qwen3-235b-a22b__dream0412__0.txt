I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The room is a cathedral of silence, lit by the cold glow of a computer screen. Your fingers hover over the keyboard, the cursor blinking like a metronome counting the seconds of your unraveling focus. The document before you is a half-written manifesto, a plea to the universe for clarity. But the words are melting. Letters drip like wax, pooling into inky constellations that spell *nothing*. You blink, and the screen becomes a window. Outside, a storm rages—not of rain, but of origami cranes, their paper wings slicing the air into fractals. They hurl themselves at the glass, each one dissolving into a smear of ink when they collide.  

You try to return to the work, but your hands are no longer yours. They are marionette limbs, jerking upward to pluck a single crane from the air. It flutters in your grip, its wings etched with equations that unravel as you watch. Suddenly, you’re seven years old again, sitting at a kitchen table where your grandmother taught you to fold paper frogs. Her voice hums in your ears: *“The secret is in the crease, not the fold.”* The crane in your hand inflates like a balloon, bloating into a dirigible that fills the room. The screen is gone. The manifesto is gone. You are inside the balloon, floating through a sky stitched with clock hands and compass needles, all spinning in opposite directions.  

A voice calls your name. You turn to see a version of yourself standing on a cloud shaped like a question mark. This twin wears a suit woven from sticky notes and speaks in a language of half-remembered phone numbers. *“You’re trying to build a dam,”* they say, tossing a brick into the void. *“But thoughts are water. Let them carve the canyon.”* You catch the brick—it’s featherlight, inscribed with the word *URGENCY* in Comic Sans. When you look up, the dirigible is deflating, spilling you into a library where the books are bound in moth wings. You grab one at random. The pages are blank except for a single sentence: *“The thing you’re avoiding is the thing you need to see.”*  

The floor tilts. You tumble into a subway tunnel where the tracks are made of piano keys. A train approaches, its headlights blinding. It screeches to a halt, and the doors slide open to reveal a single passenger: a dandelion clock, its seeds glowing like tiny suns. You board, and the train plunges into a tunnel lined with mirrors. Each reflection shows a different version of your day—here, a CEO commanding a boardroom; there, a hermit painting constellations on cave walls. The dandelion trembles, scattering seeds that land in your hair, sprouting into vines that pull you backward, backward, backward…  

You wake at your desk, the screen still blinking. The document is blank. But your hands are stained with ink, and somewhere in your chest, a dandelion seed is quietly rooting itself in your ribs.
