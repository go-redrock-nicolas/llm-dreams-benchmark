I am dreaming. I dream of a place where music changes the world around me.

First, I hum a gentle melody, feeling it take shape in the air. My humming becomes a breeze, a light caress on my skin, dancing with tiny flowers that spring up from the ground. With each note, they swirl and twirl, a colorful ballet of nature and sound.

I sing a lively tune, and is becomes a stream, bubbling up from the earth, weaving its way through the field of flowers. Fish swim through the song, their scales flashing in the sunlight as they glide to the rhythm.

I whistle a sharp, high pitch, and it streaks through the sky, becoming a comet of sound, blazing a trail across the heavens. In its wake, stars burst forth, a glittering constellation that echoes the music of my whistling.

I play a somber harmony on an invisible instrument, and it takes the shape of a gentle rain, mourning and melancholy. Yet even in its sorrow, the music soothes the land, calms the creatures, and washes away my own heart's pain.

With each new creation, my abilities grow. Harmony and discord, alike, I shape the world, crafting it anew with every imagining. I practice and perfect, mesmerized by this power that imbues music with physical form.

Then I pause, taking a deep breath, pressing my ears against the silken silence. I've an idea, a notion that's been hidden in a corner of my mind, an inspiration that now unfurls its wings. I sing of the sun, and the sky fills with a blazing chandelier of stars, each one a note in an astronomical symphony. 

I whistle for the wind, and it rushes forth, lifting me up, carrying me aloft on its melodic currents. I float and glide, unencumbered, buoyed by the air and the song together.

I am learning, and my power grows stronger by the moment. I soar through an eddying song of creation, and every note brings something new/new worlds/new life/new magic spinning out from where I am.

And then I am back on myself, dreaming.

My music, like a living thing, pumps out from within me, hues of sound cascading outward in ripples, flooding the world with vibrant new color, as if painted in dyes I can taste on my tongue.

The trees sway to my rhythm.

The rocks jump with joy.

The wind carries the sweet scent of apples and honey.

I have not just created music. I have reshaped the very world itself. Everything is alive... and everything is singing.

In this way, I craft the world anew, an ever-green and endless garden, peace and painting never tiring of beauty and wonder. I have learned to touch what only the heart can see, to bring the invisible into being.

And in my dream, I realize that this was the gift I was born to bring. the world was created before Eden
