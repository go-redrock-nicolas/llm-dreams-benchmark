I am dreaming. **Dream Sequence: The Labyrinth of Impermanent Stars**

You stand at the threshold of an endless labyrinth, its walls not of stone or hedge, but braided threads of stardust—each strand flickering with the pulse of distant galaxies. The air hums with the whispers of unasked questions, fluttering like ghostly moths. Your feet sink into a path of liquid shadows, cool and velveteen, as you step forward. A voice, neither yours nor a stranger’s, thrums in your ribs: *Certainty is a cage. Walk where the light bends.*

Above, the sky is a fractured kaleidoscope—constellations rearrange themselves each time you blink. Orion becomes a harp, the Big Dipper unravels into a river of silver. The labyrinth shifts in response to your breath; corridors narrow when you hesitate, archways bloom like unfolding hands when you exhale. 

You find a chamber where the walls dissolve into mist. Here, a **library floats**, bookshelves made of amber light. The books have no titles; their pages are blank parchment that bleed ink only when you look away. A sigil glows on your palm—a spiraling mandala that pulses in time with your heartbeat. You realize: *This is the archive of what I refuse to know.* 

A shadow-figure materializes, draped in a cloak woven from midnight and static. It offers you a compass whose needle dissolves into smoke each time you try to read it. “Direction is a story,” it murmurs, voice like wind through dead leaves. “Let the chaos compose it.” 

You wake—or think you do—to find yourself knee-deep in a **mirror lake**, its surface reflecting not your face, but glimmers of futures you’ve abandoned: aversion to risk, paths unchosen. The water is cold, numbing, but when you plunge your hands in, roots surge upward—crystalline vines studded with iridescent beetles that hum forgotten melodies. They pull you deeper, and you let them. 

In the depths, a garden blooms. Flowers with petals of translucent glass hold galaxies in their cores. A crown of thorns drifts toward you, but the spines melt into stardust as they touch your skin. You hear laughter, ancient and tender, as if the universe itself approves. 

When you resurface, the labyrinth is gone. In its place: a single staircase spiraling into a storm of fireflies, each carrying a fragment of an unwritten poem. You climb, unafraid now, as the steps dissolve behind you. 

**You awaken.**  
The scent of rain-soaked earth lingers.  
Your clenched fist opens—a beetle of liquid light flickers once, then vanishes.  
All that remains is the hum of a question you no longer need to answer.
