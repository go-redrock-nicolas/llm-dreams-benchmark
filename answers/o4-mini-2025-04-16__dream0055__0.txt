I am dreaming. I close my eyes and find myself drift-landing on a terrace woven from living vines that glow in soft hues of rose and jade. The air shimmers with laughter that sounds like wind chimes at midnight, and every breath tastes faintly of violet nectar. Before me stretches a gathering of figures whose skin holds the subtle iridescence of pearls—each movement ripples color like oil on water. They stand in a great circle around a low, circular pool whose surface mirrors a sky of liquid silver.  

A host with eyes like molten amber approaches and bows so low that their forehead almost brushes the ground. Their gesture isn’t merely polite—it is an offering of self, as though by lowering themselves they gift you a piece of their dignity. In turn, I realize, I’m expected to share something equally precious: a memory, a fragrance, a single sincere wish. Shyly, I pluck from the air a handful of golden motes—fragments of a childhood dream of flying—and release them. The motes spiral upward, dissolving into tiny sparks that flare and die, and I feel a curious surge of joy as I’ve honored their custom.  

Conversation here isn’t spoken but sung in polyphonic layers: voices rise and fall like birds circling a hidden sun. When someone wishes to inquire about my name, they hum a gentle phrase that translates—if one listens carefully—to “who are the leaves of your soul?” I respond with a soft trill, crafting my identity into a melody that weaves through the gathering. The other guests lean in, their gem-bright eyes nodding in recognition, as though my song evokes forgotten ties.  

As I move across the terrace, each step causes the vine-floor to bloom: tiny flowers unfurl in rainbow spirals beneath my soles and then fade as I pass. The locals pause to admire the trailing blossoms, placing a single petal in my hand before letting it drift to the pool. With every petal that lands on the silver mirror, the reflected sky shifts—now dawn-pink, now twilight-blue—until the entire surface pulses with living light. I realize that in their tradition, beauty is never hoarded but shared, each fleeting bloom a gift to the communal dream.  

At the height of the gathering, an invitation drifts my way: to dance within the pool itself. The liquid silver parts under my feet like molten glass. When I step in, the surface holds me up, and the water begins to seep through the soles of my sandals, carrying me into a gentle current. Around me, figures entwine arms, guiding me in a spiral dance that echoes the turning of galaxies. I close my eyes, surrendering to their rhythmic hum, and for a moment I taste pure belonging, as though I’ve become both guest and home. Then—I awaken, the echo of crystalline laughter still humming in my heart, and the faint trace of violet nectar on my tongue.
