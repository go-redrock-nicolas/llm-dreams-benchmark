I am dreaming. find myself in a cramped, musty tunnel, the damp stone walls pressing in on either side like the greedy hands of some subterranean monster. The flickering flame of my single candle casts eerie shadows that dance and writhe across the rough-hewn walls, confusing my sense of depth and direction. Each unsteady step forward kicks up puffs of choking dust that catch in my throat, making me cough and wince.   

The air grows colder as I descend deeper into the catacombs. A clammy mist settles over my skin, pricking and raised. The flickering light reveals more of the brutal, vengeful marks carved into the ancient stone that wends its way into the darkness. Ghostly faces emerge from the shadows, their hollow eyes voided. And then they vanish. 

Sense of time is lost. Eons could pass, or mere moments. A creeping dread fills me, as if invisible eyes watch my every move. The crumbling tunnels feel like a malevolent, slumbering beast - one false move and it could gobble swallowing up in its yawning maw. 

I pause, heart hammering in my chest, trying to regain my bearings. The candle flickers ominously, nearly sputtering out. I shield the tiny flame with my cupped hands, desperately praying it will hold on a little longer. In the dim glow, I see the carvings on the walls more clearly. They seem to shift and distort before my eyes, telling a twisted story of waist-high, grotesque figures that devour hapless travelers. I shudder and creep onward.

 Suddenly, as if some slumbering entity has awoken, a deep rumble echoes through the tunnels. A cold, rancid breeze sails around the corner, making the candle flame dance wildly. I feel a psuedo presence behind me, an insidious thing, a malevolent thing. Its touch sends ice racing across my spine and makes every hair on my body stand on end. 

The candle is fully extinguished, plunging me into utter darkness. My breath catches as panic threatensto consume me. I stand frozen, barely daring to breathe, desperately trying to ignore the sense of invisible, malevolent presences closing in. 

This is the darkest corner of my imagination, this is my dream, and I don't want to see it anymore. 

I squeeze my eyes shut, willing myself to wake up. Slowly, the oppressive darkness begins to recede, the malevolent presence fading into the mists of sleep. As I drift back into conscious, I am left with the lingering taste of dust and the faint whisper of ancient whispers fading in the depths of my mind.
