I am dreaming. 

You decided to express yourself through art. You paint an image that captures the essence of your feelings but also challenges the status quo and sparks controversy. You don't care about the consequences because your soul is at stake.

As you present your work, an elderly sorceress approaches you with a glowing orb in her hands. She offers to amplify your emotional resonance by infusing it into the orb. It will make your art more powerful but also dangerous for anyone who dares to look at it directly. 

You accept her offer without hesitation. You feel a surge of energy flowing through you as the sorceress channels her power into the orb. As soon as she finishes, she warns you about the risks and disappears in a flash of light.

You take the glowing orb with mixed feelings of excitement and fear. It pulsates with an intense crimson light that hurts your eyes but also fascinates you. You know that it contains the most concentrated form of your emotions, both positive and negative. 

You decide to test its power by showing it to someone who doesn't share your values or beliefs. You go out into the streets and find a group of young rebels who are protesting against the establishment. They seem intrigued by you and your strange glowing orb. 

You show them your creation, and they gasp in shock as the crimson light engulfs them. They feel something powerful and alien invading their minds, and they start to lose control over themselves. Their anger turns into rage, and their hate into madness. They attack each other without reason or mercy. 

You realize that you have made a terrible mistake. You didn't intend to harm anyone or spread chaos. You only wanted to express yourself freely and connect with others through art. But now it's too late. The damage is done, and the consequences will be felt by everyone involved. 

You wake up suddenly from your dream, sweating and trembling. You feel like you have learned an important lesson about power and responsibility but also fear and guilt. You wonder if there are other ways to express yourself without hurting anyone or breaking any rules.
