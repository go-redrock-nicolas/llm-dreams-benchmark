I am dreaming. 

After opening the front door to my grandpa's house, I see my father is standing in the hallway, looking exhausted and sad. He asks me to accompany him to see grandpa, as he has something important to tell me. I feel a sense of dread in my stomach as I enter the dimly lit living room that smells faintly of medicine and old wood. 

My grandpa is sitting in his favorite armchair, looking pale and frail. He motions for me to sit down on the couch opposite him. "I have something to tell you, my dear," he says in a soft voice. "I won't be here for much longer." I feel tears welling up in my eyes as he continues to speak, telling me stories about his life and giving me advice about the future. 

Suddenly, the door to the living room opens and a strange woman walks in. She is dressed in black and carrying a small, golden key that glints in the dim light. My grandpa sees her and suddenly sits up straight, his eyes widening in surprise. "Ah," he says. "It's time." 

The woman walks over to him and places the key on the table next to his chair. She then turns to me and says, "Your grandpa has passed on a task to you, one that only you can complete." She gives me a small, knowing smile before walking out of the room. 

I look at my grandpa, but he just nods at me, as if to say, "It's up to you now." I pick up the key and hold it in my hand, feeling its weight and warmth. I know I have a task ahead of me, one that I must complete on my own. 

As I walk out of the house and into the bright sunlight, I feel a strange sense of purpose and calm. I know I am ready for whatever comes next.
