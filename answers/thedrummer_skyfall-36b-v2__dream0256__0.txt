I am dreaming. The dream begins as I find myself walking down a dimly lit city street at night, the air thick with impending rain. Neon signs flicker and sway above, casting an ethereal glow on the wet pavement. In the distance, I hear the distant rumble of thunder, as if the heavens themselves are growling softly.

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows, their tattered clothes fluttering in the strengthening wind. It's a shabbily clad, rain-soaked homeless man, his face grimy and gaunt. He stumbles forward, his eyes imploring as the first raindrops begin to fall. Around me, people scurry past, their well-dressed silhouettes darting quickly by, ignoring his desperate pleas for help.

The man stays in a sheltered alcove, pressing a battered cardboard sign with the words "Anything helps."

I feel a tugging at my conscience, a whispering voice inside me urging me to stop and help. But my exhausted mind also tells me of my own struggles, of the hardships I face, of the need to look after myself first. I pause, torn between my instincts of compassion and my pragmatic self-preservation.

As I waver, the storm intensifies around us. Rain lashes down in sheets, pelting the Meine hard against my skin. Lightning flashes, illuminating the city in stark black and white. The homeless man huddles deeper into his sodden coat, his frail body shaking with cold and despair. Slowly, hesitant, I reach into my pocket and pull out a crumpled bill - not much, but something.

As I press it into the man's calloused hand, I lock eyes with him. In that fleeting moment, I see a flicker of hope, of gratitude, in his tired gaze. Thunder rumbles ominously overhead as the man clutches the money to his chest, his muttered thanks lost in the howling wind.

And then suddenly, with an electric jolt, I jolt into wakefulness, the dream shattering around me like delicate glass. I find myself lying in bed, my heart pounding, my skin still damp with rainwater, as the last remnants of the dream drift away like mist on a mirror. I am left with the lingering feeling of that impossible choice, the tug-of-war between empathy and self-preservation, the hard lesson that even the smallest act of kindness can ripple outwards.
