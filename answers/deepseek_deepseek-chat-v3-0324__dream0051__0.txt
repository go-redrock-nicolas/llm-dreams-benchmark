I am dreaming. The world around me takes on the hazy, liquid quality that only exists in dreams.  

The cockpit of the aircraft hums in muted tones; the controls glow softly under my fingertips. Outside the panoramic windows, the sky is a swirl of violet and indigo speckled with unfamiliar constellations that shift and ripple like ink dropped into water. The air is thick with static, clinging to my skin like invisible filaments.  

Then, alarms erupt—shrill, screaming sirens that distort as though underwater. Warning lights flash neon crimson, casting jagged reflections across the glass. My instruments flicker erratically, numbers spiraling into gibberish, needles spinning wildly. The horizon tilts violently, and the plane lurches as if some unseen hand has grabbed it from below. My stomach lurches with it.  

I scramble to compensate, gripping the yoke, but the resistance is wrong—too heavy, then suddenly weightless. The altimeter is plummeting, but when I glance outside, we are neither climbing nor falling, but suspended in the shifting sky, caught between dimensions. The passengers’ voices drift through the cabin, not panicked, but dreamlike, murmuring in a language that dissolves before I can understand it.  

Then, through the window—wings. Not the aircraft's wings, but vast, shadowy appendages unfurling from the clouds. They stretch wide enough to eclipse the stars, feathers shimmering with impossible colors, shifting from iridescent bronze to deep, hungry black. A sound hums through the fuselage—low, resonant, like a chant in an ancient temple.  

The radio crackles. A voice, not from air traffic control but from something older, whispers in my ear, *"You do not fly. You are flown."*  

The wings outside beat once.  

And everything—sky, stars, the very fabric of the dream—shatters.  

I wake up gasping. My sheets are soaked with sweat. Outside my window, the predawn sky is quiet, still, and reassuringly ordinary.  

For now.
