I am dreaming. The familiar soft hum of an ordinary morning evaporates in an instant, and in its place emerges a world unlike anything tethered to reason or memory. One moment I am stirring my coffee, the scent of roasted beans curling lazily through the quiet apartment — the next, I’m standing on the edge of a precipice formed of mirrored glass, suspended in a sky without color. There is no sun, no shadows — just light, ambient and eternal, bathing the world in hues that flicker like half-remembered dreams.

Below me — or perhaps above me — stretches a city that may have once been built by human hands, but has since mutated into something utterly alien. Towers spin like tops but stand still, undulating as if breathing. Staircases lead sideways and collapse into waterfalls. Streets float in midair, ending in nothing but golden dust that splinters and reforms with every passing second. Time here doesn’t flow — it ripples.

My body feels weightless, as though gravity were merely a suggestion, politely ignored. When I lift my hand, it ripples like water, then morphs briefly into the feathers of a bird, then an outstretched vine of blooming flowers. I open my mouth, unsure whether to laugh or scream, but instead, I hear my own voice echoing back from the horizon — decades older, filled with secrets I have not yet lived.

And then the storm arrives—not with thunder, but music.

A melody threads through the silence, ancient and formless, yet full of unbearable beauty. It doesn't come from anywhere in particular but seems to rise from the air itself, from the cracks between moments. As the song swells, creatures made of shimmering light step out from the edges of perception. They have no faces, only eyes that hold entire galaxies within them. Where they pass, the ground becomes memories — someone else's, shared like a gift.

One of them pauses before me and extends a hand, or the suggestion of one, and in its grasp, time unwinds. I see my own past: not just the events, but the forgotten feelings behind them — the spark of a forgotten crush, the aching stillness of childhood nights, the taste of laughter after years of silence. I find myself weeping without grief — kindness seems to pour from this kaleidoscopic realm, reminding me of how much I had abandoned even before I arrived here.

Then everything vanishes.

Darkness — pure and sudden, like a curtain pulled down behind closed eyes. But even in the void, I sense the presence of something vast and watching, something that wears my dreamscape like a mask for its own purpose. It speaks without words: *You are no longer the dreamer. Now you are the dream.*

And then the world shifts again. Hard ground returns to my feet. I find myself in a garden that consumes light from the air and exhales fireflies shaped like words. Each bloom whispers in a language older than sound. Behind me, the mirror-precipice still trembles, keeping something in — or something out.

I know instinctively, without doubt, that I am not meant to understand this place.

I am only meant to become it.

And the longer I remain, the less “I” will mean anything at all.
