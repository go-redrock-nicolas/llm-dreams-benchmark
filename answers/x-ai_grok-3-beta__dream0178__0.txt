I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the midst of a grand, cavernous cathedral, its ancient stone walls towering above me, adorned with intricate stained-glass windows that cast fractured, kaleidoscopic light across the pews. The air is heavy with the scent of aged wood, melting candle wax, and the faint musk of incense lingering from a ceremony long past. A solemn occasion is unfolding—a memorial service for someone of great importance, though their identity remains a misty blur in my dream-mind. Rows of mourners, dressed in somber blacks and grays, sit with bowed heads, their silence a palpable weight in the vast space. The only sound is the soft, mournful drone of an organ, its notes weaving through the air like a melancholic thread, pulling at invisible heartstrings.

I’m standing near the back, slightly apart from the crowd, my hands clasped in front of me in a forced attempt at reverence. But something is wrong—terribly, absurdly wrong. A tickle of amusement, unbidden and entirely inappropriate, begins to bubble up from somewhere deep within my chest. It starts as a tiny spark, a fleeting thought of something absurdly funny—a memory, perhaps, of a childhood prank or a ridiculous face someone pulled once. I can’t quite pin it down, but it grows, curling like smoke around my ribs, threatening to escape.

I bite my lip, hard, trying to smother the urge. My eyes dart furtively to the mourners around me, their faces etched with grief, tears silently tracing paths down pale cheeks. The priest at the altar, clad in flowing robes of deep violet, reads from a heavy, leather-bound book, his voice a low, resonant murmur that seems to echo off the very stones of the cathedral. Every word drips with gravitas, and yet, inexplicably, it only fuels my growing hysteria. I imagine him suddenly breaking into a comical falsetto, or tripping over his robes mid-sentence, and the image is so vivid that a tiny snort escapes my nose—a traitor to my crumbling composure.

My hand flies to my mouth, muffling the sound, but the effort only makes it worse. My shoulders begin to shake, silently at first, as I fight to keep the laughter locked inside. It’s a physical battle now, my diaphragm trembling with the effort, my chest tight as if I’m holding my breath underwater. I glance around, panicked, certain that everyone must be staring at me, judging my irreverence. But no one seems to notice. They’re lost in their sorrow, their eyes fixed on the altar or the flickering candles that line the aisle, tiny beacons of memory and loss.

The laughter builds like a storm inside me, wild and uncontrollable. I try to focus on something—anything—to anchor myself. I stare at the stained-glass depiction of an angel above the altar, its serene face glowing in shades of sapphire and ruby. But even the angel seems to mock me now, its halo tilted just slightly as if it’s in on the joke. I imagine it winking at me, conspiratorial, and that’s the final straw. A choked giggle slips out, louder this time, reverberating in the hallowed silence like a pebble dropped into a still pond.

Heads turn. Not many, but enough. A woman in a black veil glances over her shoulder, her eyes narrowing above the delicate lace. A man with a stern, furrowed brow shifts uncomfortably in his pew, his gaze piercing through me. My face burns with shame, and I duck my head, pretending to cough into my sleeve, hoping to disguise the sound. But the giggles keep coming, each one harder to suppress than the last, each one a tiny rebellion against the somber weight of the room.

Desperate, I pinch my arm, willing the sharp sting to snap me out of this madness. I think of sad things—lost pets, rainy days, forgotten birthdays—but nothing works. The laughter has taken on a life of its own, a mischievous imp dancing just out of reach, taunting me. I imagine myself bolting for the heavy oak doors at the back of the cathedral, bursting into the cool night air and letting the laughter spill out in waves, unrestrained. But my feet remain rooted to the spot, trapped by some unseen force of decorum—or perhaps fear of what lies beyond the threshold.

The priest raises his hands, calling for a moment of silent reflection, and the cathedral falls into a hush so profound it feels as if the world itself has stopped breathing. In that silence, the urge to laugh crescendoes to an unbearable peak. My entire body trembles with the effort of holding it in, my vision blurring with tears of both mirth and mortification. I’m a dam about to burst, a balloon stretched to its limit, and I know—I *know*—that if I let even a sliver of sound escape now, it will be deafening.

And then, as if orchestrated by the cruel hand of my subconscious, a pigeon flutters down from the rafters above, its wings beating noisily in the sacred hush. It lands clumsily on a pew just ahead of me, cooing with oblivious cheer, and I lose it. A guffaw erupts from me, loud and raw, echoing off the vaulted ceiling like a thunderclap. Every head turns now, eyes wide with shock and disapproval, and I clap both hands over my mouth, horrified. But the laughter keeps coming, unstoppable, a river that has broken its banks. I’m doubled over now, gasping for breath between peals of uncontrollable mirth, tears streaming down my face as the pigeon, startled by my outburst, flaps wildly and knocks over a candle.

The flame fizzles out in a puff of smoke, and for a moment, time seems to freeze. The mourners stare, the priest falters mid-prayer, and I’m caught in the eye of this surreal storm, a lone figure laughing in the face of sanctity. Shame and hilarity war within me, but the laughter wins, carrying me away on its absurd current until the cathedral itself begins to dissolve around me, the stone walls melting like wax, the mourners fading into shadows.

I’m floating now, weightless, the laughter echoing in an empty void as the dream shifts, pulling me toward some new, unknown tableau. But even as the scene changes, the feeling lingers—that wild, untamed joy, tinged with the bitter edge of inappropriateness, a reminder of the strange, untethered nature of dreams where even the most sacred spaces cannot contain the chaos of the human heart.
