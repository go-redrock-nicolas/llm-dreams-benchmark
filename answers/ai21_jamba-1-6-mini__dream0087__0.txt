I am dreaming. The dream starts with you sitting at a wooden table, surrounded by a family of strangers. The walls surrounding you seem ancient, like they were carved out of stone, and torches flicker on the walls creating an ominous glow. You feel the weight of their eyes on you, tensely waiting for you to speak.

One of the family members begins to speak, her voice sharp and tinged with bitterness. "They've always looked down on us, you know. They think they're better than us."

Another family member retorts loudly, "That's not true. You've always been jealous; always trying to poke at us. Always trying to bring us down."

You feel the tension thick in the air. It's as if the very walls are pressing in on you.

You try to calm them. "Let's focus on the future instead of dwelling on the past. What can we do to move forward? How can we create peace between you?"

An older woman interrupts, her voice trembling. "There can be no peace. Not after what they did."

Another person yells back, "This kind of talk is exactly why we're here. You're always making it about us, making it personal. You refuse to see reality."

The atmosphere grows more tense. Your voice rises a little, trying to keep control. "Please. Let's focus on solutions. I know we can find a way forward if we try."

The family grows more restless, the tension reaching a breaking point. Suddenly, one person slams their hand on the table, the air filled with an overwhelming sense of anger. "That's it! We're done talking," she declares before storming out of the room, the door slamming behind her loud enough to shake the walls.

The rest of the family follows suit, leaving you there, amid the echoing silence and flickering light. As the dream fades, you feel the heaviness of the unresolved conflict weigh down on you. You wake up in a cold sweat, the weight of their unresolved issues lingering with you, even in the waking world.
