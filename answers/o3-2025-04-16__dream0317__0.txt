I am dreaming. …I drift through a velvety darkness that hums like a distant choir.  In the gloom I notice a thin silver thread, pulsing gently, tugging on my curiosity like a soft heartbeat.  I glide toward it, weightless, until the thread widens and blossoms into a gate made of night-blooming flowers: petals of starlight, stamens of moon-dust, dew that glitters with entire constellations.

The gate yawns open without a sound, and I slip through.

On the other side, gravity forgets the rules.  Mountains float like enormous origami cranes, their snowy peaks folded inward to form hidden valleys.  Rivers spiral upward, water curling and unfurling into ribbons of liquid crystal that loop across the violet sky.  Everything glows with an internal ember—subtle, as though the world itself is holding its breath.

A path of luminous stepping-stones appears beneath my feet, each stone whispering a note in an unknown scale.  I place a foot on the first and hear a low C, resonant and reassuring.  The next stone hums an E, the third a G, and the path plays a slow chord progression as I walk, composing music with every step.

Ahead rises a colossal tree that seems half plant, half galaxy.  Its trunk is transparent, filled with swirling nebulae and specks of dust that birth tiny suns.  Branches splay across the sky, bearing fruit that resemble pocket watches—each ticking at a different tempo.  One watch-fruit detaches and floats toward me.  When I touch it, the ticking muffles and a hologram flickers across its crystal face: an hourglass whose sand grains are miniature versions of myself, tumbling and laughing.

I press the watch-fruit to my ear.

     “Choose your moment,” the fruit murmurs, its voice a duet of flute and thunder.  
     “Do you wish to walk forward in time, backward, or sideways?”

Sideways?  The idea crackles like static in my mind.  I imagine stepping into a fold between seconds, a place where memories can trade costumes with dreams.  The fruit smiles—a crescent of golden gears—then dissolves into a mist of fireflies that circle me three times and dart away.

I feel a new texture beneath my soles: sand.  But it’s not ordinary sand; each grain carries an echo, snippets of conversations from a million different worlds.  I crouch down, scoop a handful, and let it trickle through my fingers:

     “The moon forgot my name today,” says one grain in a lilting accent.  
     “I’m teaching comets to waltz,” declares another.  
     “Have you ever tasted the color of longing?” whispers a third.

Their murmurs weave into a tapestry of distant lives, yet somehow the stories feel intimately my own.

Beyond the sand lies a mirror-smooth sea, its surface a mercury sheen that reflects not what is, but what could be.  When I gaze upon it, I see a city I have never visited: spiraling towers made of stained glass clouds, streets where shadows bloom into flowers when footsteps pass.  Lanterns shaped like origami birds drift overhead, each carrying a secret too light to weigh them down.

A gentle breeze coaxes a single ripple across the mercury water.  The reflected city shivers, then splits into two identical images—one shimmering with sunrise pinks, the other with twilight indigos.  A translucent ferry emerges, straddling the seam between the twin reflections.  Its hull is woven from moonbeams; its mast, a single quill that writes silver calligraphy across the breeze.

I board the ferry.

The vessel drifts without oars, propelled by possibility itself.  Around me, the world blurs, as though someone smeared pastel chalk across the edges of reality.  Soon the two mirrored cities converge into one, but instead of docking at a pier, the ferry glides up a spiraling draft of warm air—sailing skyward until we pass through the membrane of a gargantuan soap bubble.

Inside the bubble is a library.

Shelves arc in impossible helices, stretching infinitely upward yet folding snugly into the bubble’s curved interior.  Books dart from shelf to hand like friendly hummingbirds, each bound in material that shifts with the story’s mood—velvet for romance, obsidian glass for tragedy, polished seashells for adventure.  One book settles into my palms.  Its cover is a living garden of moss and violets, and its title appears only when I dare to open it: “The Chronicle of Things You Never Allowed Yourself to Imagine.”

I inhale.

The fragrance of old paper melds with petrichor and stardust.  Pages flutter, and I’m no longer in the library—I’m inside the book itself.  I ride a comet’s tail through corridors of color, dive into oceans made of sunrise, conduct an orchestra of shadows that play symphonies on beams of moonlight.  Each chapter ends with a question, handwritten by someone who must be me:

     “What new wonder will you permit to bloom once you wake?”

The final page glows blank, waiting for an answer.  I hesitate, pen hovering.  Around me, colors begin to drip like wet paint, and the comet I stand upon melts into stardust.  Wakefulness pulls at the edges of the dream, threatening to unravel it like a loose thread on an otherwise immaculate tapestry.

With sudden clarity I scrawl one word across the empty page:

     “Everything.”

Ink flares white-hot, tidal waves of dawn surge through the text, and the dream erupts in a bouquet of light.  I taste the citrus tang of possibility, hear a chord that contains every note, feel my eyelids twitch in the waking world.

But just before consciousness claims me, I linger in the hush that follows revelation—an afterglow that promises the gate, the nebula tree, the sand that speaks, will always be a thought away.

I carry that promise into waking.
