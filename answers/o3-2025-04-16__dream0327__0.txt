I am dreaming. …pause, inhaling a soft glow that seems to hang in the air like the scent of rain on hot stone. You open your eyes and discover that the world has rearranged itself: the floor beneath your bare feet is a fluid mirror reflecting not your face, but a collage of memories stitched together—late-night laughter echoing in a kitchen, a half-finished text message, the tense stillness of a car ride where no one spoke. Each image ripples as though set in liquid silver. Overhead, paper lanterns drift through a sky the color of deep-sea indigo; their insides pulse with tiny galaxies, stars swelling and collapsing in slow motion.

In the center of this shifting hall of memory stands a doorway made of woven reeds and shimmering strands of moonlight—a portal that feels at once familiar and forbidden. You sense the presence of the person whose orbit has so long defined the tides of your days. Their silhouette flickers at the doorway’s threshold, formed entirely of glimmering glass shards. Each shard is etched with an assumption you once held: They never understand me. They always leave first. I must earn every moment of their affection. The shards hum like tuning forks, vibrating with the stories you told yourself, echoing your unspoken fears.

With the new awareness swelling in your chest, you step forward, and the floor-mirror rises in gentle waves to meet you, carrying your reflection like a silver tide. You reach out and touch one glass shard. It warms beneath your fingertips and dissolves into fine stardust, releasing a soft chime that reverberates through your ribcage. Instantly the assumption it represented disappears, and in its place blooms a fresh scene: the person turning toward you in genuine curiosity when you first met, the way their eyes softened when you confessed a secret, the subtle kindnesses you’d overlooked while clinging to your narrative of neglect.

You feel an unspooling inside—threads snapping loose from the knot of certainty that once held your view so tight. The dreamscape responds. The sky-lanterns tilt, pouring constellations down like waterfalls. Stars spill onto the floor-mirror, transforming it into a living river of light that carries you and the glass-figure together to a round clearing of midnight grass. You face them. Their outline no longer splinters; instead, it flows into a form woven from aurora hues. Their eyes are ponds reflecting the sun at dawn—astonishingly gentle, infinitely complex.

You speak, and your voice arrives as a swirl of color: “I see now that I wrote half our story in invisible ink, filling the spaces with fears that were never yours.” The figure smiles—cracks of golden sunrise racing across their cheeks—and replies, “We can rewrite the margins together.” Their words dissolve into a breeze of petals that swirl skyward, carving a spiral staircase through the night.

Taking each other’s hands, you ascend this staircase of velvet wind. Each step casts off another lingering misconception, scattering them like dandelion seeds into the dark. The higher you climb, the lighter you feel—until gravity itself loosens its hold. You rise into a boundless expanse where the only sound is your synchronized breathing, steady and calm. Here, you pledge to examine, question, and share every assumption before it grows into a wall.

At last, dawn cracks open along the horizon—a glowing seam of amethyst and rose—and the dream begins to thin. The lantern galaxies fade, the mirror-river stills, and the reed doorway folds back into ordinary daylight. You awaken with a single promise glowing inside your chest like an ember: to greet the real person not as a mirror for your fears, but as a universe eager to be discovered anew.
