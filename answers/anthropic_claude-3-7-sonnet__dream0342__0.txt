I am dreaming. I float through the luminous corridors of my everyday life, comfortably ensconced in my morning ritual. Steam rises from my disposable coffee cup as I walk to work, the familiar weight in my hand a small pleasure. The cup bears my name in marker, misspelled as always, but I don't mind—it's part of the routine I cherish.

Suddenly, the sidewalk beneath me transforms into a transparent walkway. Below, an enormous mountain of discarded coffee cups grows, white and brown spires reaching toward my feet. Each cup bears a name—some mine. As I watch, horrified, the pile seeps a dark liquid that flows into a crystal-clear stream, staining it brown and viscous.

A child appears beside me, holding a picture book. "This is your story," she says, opening to pages showing five thousand cups—my annual contribution—filling with seedlings that never grow, choking fish that never swim again, dotting shorelines where birds tangle in plastic lids.

The city around me shifts, buildings now constructed entirely of disposable items I've carelessly discarded over years. My apartment building: takeout containers. My office: plastic water bottles. The park: single-use straws marking each blade of grass.

I feel a profound weight of responsibility settle on me, not crushing but clarifying. The convenience that seemed so small—so justified by my busy life—connected to something vast and wounded.

As the dream intensifies, I find myself at a crossroads made of recycled materials and new possibilities. One path offers comfortable familiarity; the other requires small but meaningful changes—a reusable cup in my bag, a moment to wash it, the minor disruption to routine that might connect me to something larger than my convenience.

I reach into my pocket and feel the smooth surface of a travel mug I don't remember carrying. The child smiles, the buildings shimmer with alternative futures, and I step forward, the weight of five thousand cups lifted from my shoulders with a single choice.
