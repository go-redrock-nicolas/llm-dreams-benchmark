I am dreaming. Floating between consciousness and slumber, I find myself standing at the threshold of an ancient library that stretches infinitely in all directions. The ceiling arches impossibly high, adorned with constellations that slowly shift and rearrange themselves while I watch. Books with spines of shimmering metals and covers bound in materials I cannot name line shelves that curve and spiral in defiance of conventional geometry.

As I step forward, my footfalls create ripples of light that spread across the marble floor, which sometimes feels solid and sometimes feels like walking on the surface of water. The air is thick with the scent of ancient parchment, cinnamon, and something otherworldly—perhaps the fragrance of knowledge itself.

A librarian approaches, her form shifting between that of an elderly woman with kind eyes and a child with stars for pupils. Her hair flows upward as if underwater, containing tiny galaxies that birth and die within her silvery locks. "You've arrived," she says, her voice somehow both a whisper and an echo. "We've been cultivating this collection since before your species learned to dream."

She extends her hand, offering me a book that wasn't there a moment before. Its cover seems to be made of mirror-like material that reflects not my face but glimpses of lives I might have lived. The pages, when I open them, contain words written in ink that changes color with my breathing—sometimes flowing like mercury, sometimes blooming like watercolor across the page.

"This is the Atlas of Forgotten Possibilities," she explains as the words begin to rise from the page, forming three-dimensional scenes that hover between us. "Every choice never made, every path never walked, preserved here for those who find their way to us."

I reach out to touch one of the floating scenes—a mountain range I've never seen but somehow recognize—and suddenly I'm standing there, feeling the crisp alpine wind against my skin, hearing the distant call of creatures that exist nowhere in waking reality. The sky above is not one color but a tapestry of blues, violets, and colors without names.

When I turn around, the library is still there, visible through a doorway standing impossibly in the middle of the mountainside. The librarian watches from the threshold, her smile knowing. "You needn't choose just one," she says. "Time moves differently here. You can explore them all."

And so I begin my journey through doors within doors, worlds within worlds—each more vibrant and impossible than the last, each feeling more real than reality itself.
