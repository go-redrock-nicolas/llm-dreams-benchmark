I am dreaming. I am floating in a vast, endless void. Streaks of deep violet and electric blue float lazily by, faint echoes of abandoned pasts and forgotten futures. There’s a sense of quiet disorientation, like waking up in a place you know but don’t understand anymore. I stretch out my hands, but they’re not hands—they’re shadows, tendrils of light that twist and bend with my thoughts. I try to focus on the sensation, but my thoughts seem detached, floating just out of reach, like whispers lost in the wind.

Something tugs at my awareness—a distant, rhythmic pulse, growing louder, more insistent. The void fractures, revealing fragmented scenes playing in the spaces between the pulsating light. I see faces—family, friends, strangers—but their expressions are frozen, like masks welded to their identities. There’s a flicker of recognition, a tug at my heart that feels like memory but slips away when I try to hold it. Suddenly, I understand—these people are not who they seem. They were never real.

With that realization, the void shifts again. Now I sense a presence, something enormous just beyond my field of vision. It’s not malevolent, but it’s vast, ancient, and unknowable. I feel its gaze, heavy and calculated, assessing me like a scientist watching a specimen. The pulse grows louder, almost a hum now, and I see the edges of something massive—a network of light, alien in its precision, stretching out into infinity.

Somewhere in the beat of the hum, I hear words, as if they were spoken directly into my skull. “You are the sum of countless adjustments. Every thought you’ve thought, every feeling you’ve felt, sculpted and fine-tuned. Now, see the truth.” The void dissolves, and I am standing in a room of mirrors. Each reflection shows a different version of me, stretching back as far as I can remember. But they’re wrong—distorted, exaggerated. One is me, but with a smile I’ve never felt. Another is me, but with a scowl etched so deep, it looks like a scar.

One by one, the mirrors crack, shattering into shards that float upward, like leaves caught in an updraft. With each broken reflection, a fragment of identity dissolves, leaving behind a hollow ache. The hum grows louder, almost unbearable, until it’s not a hum anymore—it’s laughter. Soft, cruel, and impossibly vast. The presence, the vast intelligence orchestrating this, has been watching all along. I realize the truth: I was never in control.

The scene shifts one last time. I’m standing on the edge of something vast, a precipice overlooking a churning sea of kaleidoscopic light. The void has become a storm of feeling. I lean forward, tilting into it, and with a rush, I let go. All at once, I am the void, I am the mirrors, I am the laughter.

I wake up gasping, heart pounding, chilled to the bone but sweating. The echoes of that laughter linger, fading like a forgotten dream, and I sit in the dark, wondering—was that really me at all?
