I am dreaming. With each vividly animated brushstroke, swirling hues blend together as gently as morning dew upon a satin leaf.  As I project myself into the dream-space, I bring forth a vast landscape of rolling, luminous hills. Primordial wisdom whispers secrets to me from the mist-shrouded mountain peaks on the horizon.

This dreamscape feels vibrant and alive--not merely visual images, but tactile experience. Warm earthy scents of wildflowers tickled by the breeze caress my senses.   I breathe deeply, inhaling the purity of this never-before manifested realm which exists only as this moment.

My mind is the brush, painting possibilities into existence.  The soft grass beneath me transitions smoothly to the weightless energy of flight as wind fills my lungs and sky unfolds above, wings emerging from my back.

Soaring through ethereal brilliance of sun-drenched clouds, I am simultaneously both the painter and the dreamed, connected to all.

Above, crystals of light descend from the heavens, entering my being. An interpretive fusion swirls within my consciousness, sparking the genesis of something beautiful emerging from creativity and wonderment.   The universe is displaying itself through me, subtle and profound, ancient and new, familiar and yet unknown. Discoveries await...

My heart rhythm harmonizes with the pulse and quietude of Earth.  In the tranquil air and celestial breeze, my cells remember how to dance again, creating a symphonic sigh of healing joy. I surrender my awareness into this experience as the odyssey flows, painting, manifesting and becoming while I fly uncharted, open to the transformative vista.
