I am dreaming. You are dreaming. At first, the world around you feels impossibly vast—an endless garden of coral-pink blossoms dripping with honeydew, their petals glowing like lanterns in the dusk. Beneath your bare feet, the grass is soft as woven silk; every blade hums with a faint warmth. Yet despite this riot of colors and scents, you feel a hollow ache, an unshakable sense that what you most need is nowhere to be found.

You move through the garden and soon find yourself at the edge of a crystalline lake whose surface shimmers with liquid moonlight. Along its banks stand glass jars brimming with perfectly ripened fruits—ruby-red strawberries that pulse with juice, plump blueberries that shine like polished sapphires, and golden pears translucent as sunlight. Objective truth tells you these jars contain more than enough to satisfy your hunger forever. Still, your stomach twists into knots as though you’re starving. You lean forward, longing to taste, but every time your fingers brush a fruit’s curved side, it winks out of existence—puff—replaced by a puff of cool, empty air.

Puzzled, you wander downhill into a cavern lit by phosphorescent moss. Hundreds of tiny doors line the walls, each carved with a symbol: a heart, a star, an open hand. You know—somehow—that behind every door lies exactly what you crave. Opening the door with the heart should flood you with love; the star, with purpose; the open hand, with generosity. But as you press your palm against any knob it shrivels, your hand growing brittle as old parchment. You try again and again, but the doors remain sealed. A voice echoes through the cavern: “You have enough. Why do you fear you do not?”

At that question, the dream shifts. A gentle wind ripples across the lake outside, drifting in to carry away the cavern’s stale air. You step back into moonlight, and the jars of fruit reappear—this time scattered on the grass as if someone set out a banquet. The world whispers to you that abundance is your birthright. And yet here you are, convinced you’ll go hungry. For the first time in the dream you pause and look inward. You see a shape coalescing at your chest—a dark knot of “not enough,” woven from old fears and unfinished stories. It’s no bigger than a pebble, yet it radiates cold.

Compelled by curiosity, you cup it in your hands. It trembles like a living thing, then unravels into a tangle of voices: “What if it’s not enough? What if you lose it?” You realize those murmurs aren’t true—they’re echoes of childhood scarcity, a feeling you carried even when meals were plentiful, even when friends and family surrounded you. You let them speak until the last echo fades, then you set the empty knot down on a flat stone by the lake. It dissolves into ripples on the water, leaving the lakeshore perfectly still.

And now—at last—you step forward. You pick a glowing strawberry by its silver stem and bring it to your lips. Its juice floods your senses, sweeter than you ever remembered sweetness could be. You taste safety, warmth, enoughness. Each subsequent bite feels like reclaiming a promise you’d forgotten you’d made to yourself. The more you eat, the more the garden seems to sigh in relief. The lantern-petals brighten; the wind hums a lullaby; every unopened door in the cavern swings wide. Love, purpose, generosity—all stand waiting for you, fully formed and abundant.

You wake just as dawn’s first light pries open your eyelids. Pulled back into reality, you carry with you the vivid truth of the dream: scarcity lives only in the shadows of your mind—and where you once felt empty, plenty patiently waits.
