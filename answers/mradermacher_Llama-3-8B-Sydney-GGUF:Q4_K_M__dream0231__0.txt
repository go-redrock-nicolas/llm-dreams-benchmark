I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world full of colors and sounds.  I can fly and swim and run without getting tired.   The sky is blue, the water is clear, the grass is green.
I see a table filled with delicious food:  cakes, pies, cookies, sandwiches, burgers, fries, shakes, sodas...   I smell the aroma of spices and herbs.  My mouth waters.
I hear music playing in the background:  rock, pop, classical, jazz...   I feel happy and carefree.
Someone approaches me and offers me a choice:  an immediate small reward or a significantly larger future benefit that requires waiting several months. 
I am confused by this offer.  How can someone give me something without asking for anything in return?  Why do they want to make me wait for so long?
I decide to ask them some questions:
    Who are you?  What do you want from me?  Why are you giving me this choice?  What will happen if I take the immediate reward or the future benefit?
They answer me:
    I am your friend and helper.  I want to make your life better and easier.  I am giving you this choice because I respect your freedom and independence.  If you take the immediate reward, you will get some money that you can use to buy things or pay for services.  If you take the future benefit, you will get more money that you can use to buy even more things or pay for even better services.  But if you don't take either one, then I will give you nothing at all.
I think about their answers and my situation.  I realize that they are right.  They are my friend and helper who wants to make my life better and easier.  They respect my freedom and independence by giving me this choice.  If I don't take either one, then I will regret it forever.
So I make my choice:
    I want the future benefit!  I don't care about the present desires or the financial needs.  I just know that I need something better than what I have now.  I want to see more places, meet new people, learn new things, create beautiful art, write inspiring stories, build amazing structures, solve complex problems...   I want to live my life to the fullest potential.
Please let me take this opportunity to change myself and the world for good.

Amen.
