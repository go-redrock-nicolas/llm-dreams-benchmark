I am dreaming. You step into the Dreamlands, a place of deep mystery and profound beauty, where every thought and feeling you've ever had forms the very fabric of its shifting landscapes. The air is soft, carrying whispers of forgotten desires and echoes of unspoken fears. Overhead, the sky glimmers in hues you've only imagined, blending shades of violet, emerald, and gold, streaked with wisps of light that pulse in rhythm with your own heart. Below you, the ground seems alive, rippling subtly underfoot like the surface of a still pond disturbed by a falling leaf. Every step creates ripples that spread outward, forming shapes and symbols, fluid and transient. 

A path of flickering light unrolls before you, guiding your steps deeper into the Dreamlands. It winds through ethereal forests where trees with silver trunks grow, reaching up to meet the glow of celestial orbs. Their leaves rustle with secrets, murmuring softly in a language you can almost understand. You sense something beyond the trees, calling to you with a faint song, elusive but insistent. The song feels familiar, like an ancient memory unearthed after years buried beneath the weight of waking life. 

But as you venture onwards, following the pull of this haunting melody, the dream begins to take a darker turn. The trees grow denser, their trunks twisting unnaturally, shadowy shapes flitting between their branches. The soft ground beneath you grows uneven, rocks slicing through it, sharp and jagged, cutting into your steps. The landscape morphs, reflecting an undercurrent of unease. The air thickens, heavy with a sweet, sickly fragrance that cloying and overbearing. You press on, trying to outrun the creeping dread, yet it wraps itself around you, inescapable. 

Ahead, the path culminates in a sudden drop: a cliff edge overlooking a bottomless chasm. The chasm yawns dark and deep, its sheer edges sharp as glass. The song you followed now emanates from below, faint and distorted, growing louder and more chaotic. A massive, unseen force swirls in the pit, and you know that falling into its depths would bring unimaginable horror. But something pulls at you, whispering that this is the heart of the Dreamlands, the place where all things begin and end, where the true essence of the dream lies. 

Just as you teeter at the edge, ready to take that fateful plunge, a figure emerges from behind you. A woman, her form radiant, skin like moonlight, hair flowing in a wind you cannot feel. She reaches for you, her touch soft but definite. You feel her presence, warm and comforting. She whispers your name, a single word that resonates through the dream like a song in its truest form. 

“Wake,” she says, and the dream shatters. 

And you wake, breathless and trembling. The air is cool on your skin, your heart racing. You lie there, trying to separate the threads of reality from the lingering remnants of that dreamscape. But even as you try, the memory fades, slipping through your fingers like sand. Its strangeness remains, a faint ache in your chest that pulses with every beat of your heart. The day unfolds slowly before you, filled with that sense of elusive longing you can't quite place, the memory of the Dreamlands never fully gone but never fully graspable either. The boundary between waking and dream becomes blurred, leaving you wondering if, in this waking world, there’s something you’re forgetting something you’ve left behind in that shifting, living realm.
