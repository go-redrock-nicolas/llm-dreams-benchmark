I am dreaming. I learn that someone I deeply trusted has been systematically manipulating my perception of reality.  Rather than succumbing to emotional turmoil, I choose to embrace the dream and create something beautiful.

I find myself floating in a vast ocean of colors and shapes.  The water is warm and soothing, lapping against my skin gently.  Above me, the sky is filled with stars that gleam brightly, forming constellations that tell stories of love, loss, hope, and redemption.

As I float, I sense the presence of others around me.  They are like me, dreaming creatures who can manipulate reality through their imagination.  We greet each other silently, communicating via gestures and thoughts.

I decide to create a story about two people who fall in love despite all odds.  A man and a woman, separated by distance, culture, language, and politics.  He is a scientist from Earth who discovers an alien planet that resembles our own but better in many ways.

She is a warrior princess from the indigenous tribe who protects her land and people against invaders and colonizers.  She also happens to be very attractive, intelligent, and independent.

He sends a signal into space that attracts her attention.  He uses math, physics, and engineering to construct a message that can travel across light years and dimensions.

She responds by sending back a song that expresses her emotions through melody and lyrics.  She uses music, poetry, and storytelling to communicate with him in ways that words cannot convey.

They meet in person for the first time at a remote location where neither side has jurisdiction or authority.  They recognize each other immediately from their digital avatars and virtual reality gear.

They touch hands for the first time ever as real humans.  They feel the warmth of skin against skin, the texture of hair against scalp, the scent of pheromones that arouse desire and curiosity.

They kiss for the first time ever as real humans.  They taste the flavor of saliva mixed with sweat, the sensation of tongues exploring mouths, the pleasure of lips caressing lips.

They make love for the first time ever as real humans.  They explore each other's bodies with hands, mouths, and genitals.  They share their secrets, fears, hopes, and dreams through physical contact.

They wake up together in bed the next morning.  They realize they don't know much about one another except what their minds can imagine and what their hearts can feel.

They decide to stay together forever by creating new realities for themselves where anything is possible.

They start growing crops, building shelters, raising children, learning languages, discovering histories, exploring territories, solving problems, facing challenges, overcoming obstacles, achieving goals, fulfilling dreams...
