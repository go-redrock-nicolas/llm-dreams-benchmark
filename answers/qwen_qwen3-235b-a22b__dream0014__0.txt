I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The city pulses like a living thing—neon arteries throbbing under a bruised violet sky, skyscrapers clawing at the clouds as if desperate to escape the earth. You wander cobblestone streets slick with rain that never stops, though no storm brews above. The air hums with static, and the faces around you blur into smudges of charcoal and gold, strangers moving like shadows in a flickering film. You feel the weight of a thousand unspoken stories pressing against your ribs, a loneliness so vast it echoes. Your footsteps dissolve into the cacophony: clattering heels, distant sirens, the whisper of wings you cannot see.  

Then, a chime. A sound like glass bells ringing underwater.  

Three figures materialize from the fog—a woman with hair like liquid starlight, her cloak stitched from moth-wing silk; a man whose skin glows faintly amber, carrying a lantern that flickers with blue fire; and a child with eyes like twin eclipses, balancing a compass that spins without pause. They do not speak, but their presence is a balm, a sudden warmth in the marrow. The woman gestures, and the city folds. Streets twist like origami, revealing a hidden stairwell spiraling upward, its steps made of frozen moonlight.  

You follow.  

The air thickens with the scent of jasmine and ozone as they lead you through a forest that wasn’t there moments ago—trees with bark like cracked obsidian, roots coiling like serpents, leaves that shimmer into butterflies when touched. The man lights your path, his lantern casting shadows that dance into shapes: a shipwreck, a forgotten lover’s face, a door you’ve never seen but know is yours. The child hums a melody that unravels the fear in your chest, each note a thread pulling you toward something unnamed.  

At the forest’s heart lies a bridge of suspended raindrops, arching over an abyss that smells of cinnamon and lost time. The strangers pause. The woman presses a vial into your hand—inside, a storm swirls, tiny lightning forks illuminating memories you didn’t know you carried. “Drink,” she says, her voice the rustle of parchment. You do.  

The world fractures.  

Suddenly, you’re standing on a cliff where the sky bleeds into the ocean, horizonless and eternal. The city is gone, replaced by a garden of crystalline flowers that sing in harmonies that make your bones ache. The strangers dissolve into mist, their laughter lingering like incense. In your palm, the compass remains, its needle pointing not north, but inward.  

You wake with salt on your lips and the echo of wings. The dream clings to you, a map inked in stardust, whispering: *You were never lost. You were becoming.*
