I am dreaming. You wake to an uncanny hush. No hum of refrigerator motors or distant car engines disturbs the dawn. Your phone screen stays as dark as a shuttered window. You fumble for the lamp switch—nothing. In the silence, your heartbeat reverberates like a gong.

Sliding out of bed, you peer through the window. The streetlights lie dead, and in their place a procession of lantern-bearing neighbors drifts past, their soft glow spilling amber onto cobblestones. You step outside into a world that feels half-remembered, half-invented.

Above you, the sky is painted in bruised purples and coppery golds. A flock of birds wheels overhead, their wings trailing sparks of phosphorescence as if the very air has been charged by memory. Everywhere you look, cables and wires hang limp between buildings, becoming bent branches on which tiny, bioluminescent fungi have sprouted. The fungus pulses in time with your pulse, as though it shares your life force.

You walk toward the town square, now transformed into a riot of human ingenuity freed from screens. A carpenter carves intricate spirals into a great oak cartwheel, the rhythmic tap-tap of his mallet echoing like cathedral bells. Across the way, a seamstress stitches a mosaic quilt from rescued bits of denim and silk, the couch-cushion scraps telling stories in every patch. Children chase each other, brandishing wooden swords that gleam with hand-forged metal tips. Their laughter rings uncompromised by echo chambers of recorded sound.

Tucked beneath an ancient elm, an elderly storyteller sits beside a crackling bonfire. She lifts her chin to the sky and summons a tale of how, in the moment the machines died, the earth exhaled a deep, tremoring sigh. Leaves unfurled, roots pushed up through sidewalks, and people—startled, at first—remembered the magic of building community by hand. You settle beside her, inhaling the warm, resinous scent of burning pine.

In the dream’s next ripple, you find yourself aboard a slow-rolling caravan bound for the mountains. Horses—strong and patient—draw wooden wagons heaped with solar-paneled mirrors that reflect moonlight into clearings. You help plant a grove of young apple trees, their blossoms pale pink and fragrant against the starry black. A traveler shows you how to press cider by stomping in an oak vat, every footfall echoing a heartbeat of hope.

As the dream deepens, you realize that this world without wires or silicon is rewoven from human hands. It pulses with texture—leather, linen, oak bark—and each person’s breath becomes part of the new electric rhythm: the breath of air, firelight, and soil. You smile, sensing the fragile bloom of possibility. Here, in the unpowered dawn, you are both architect and apprentice of a society rediscovering its ancient song.
