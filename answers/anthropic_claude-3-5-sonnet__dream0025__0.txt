I am dreaming. *In this ethereal state, I find myself standing in a crystalline glass elevator, ascending through what seems to be the interior of an impossibly tall building. The walls around me shift between translucent and opaque, pulsing like a living heartbeat. Years of dedication, sleepless nights, and relentless pursuit have led to this moment – my life's work culminating in what awaits at the top floor.

The elevator's soft hum mingles with my thundering heartbeat as golden numbers flash by: 86...87...88... Each digit represents a milestone, a challenge overcome, a moment of doubt conquered. My reflection in the glass shows fragments of my past selves – younger, more uncertain versions that have merged into who I am now.

The air grows thinner, more electric. Small spheres of light begin to dance around me, like fireflies made of stardust. They seem to whisper echoes of encouragement from everyone who believed in me along the way.

Floor 99 approaches. My hands tremble slightly as I clutch a leather portfolio – inside it, everything I've worked for. The elevator slows, and I notice the glass walls are now showing scenes from my journey: late nights at the desk, breakthrough moments, temporary failures that became stepping stones.

The doors begin to part, revealing a vast chamber bathed in an otherworldly blue light. A panel of shadowy figures seated at a crescent-shaped table awaits. Just as I step forward to present my life's work, to finally learn if I've achieved what I've sacrificed so much for...

...all sound suddenly compresses into a single crystalline note, hanging in the air like frozen time itself...*
