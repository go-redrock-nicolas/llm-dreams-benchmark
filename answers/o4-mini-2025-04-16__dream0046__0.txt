I am dreaming. As your heart races and adrenaline surges, you lurch forward through a city that feels both achingly familiar and jarringly alien. The midnight sky overhead flickers with ribbons of electric teal, each pulse synchronized to some hidden drum you can feel thrumming in your bones. Streetlamps sputter unevenly, casting warped, crawling shadows that slither across cracked pavement. In every storefront window, mannequins twist their heads toward you, eyes glowing a soft, unblinking crimson—as if they’ve sensed the danger you alone perceive.

You swallow hard against the dry tang of dust in the air, the metallic taste of fear settling on your tongue. Around you, people drift past in dreamlike isolation, their faces half-turned toward neon billboards hawking banal comforts—“Never Fear Our Sunscreen!” one proclaims—while you see the real threat in those same ads. Each pixel flicker on the screens bleeds into an ominous warning: their carefree smiles warp into hollow masks, mouths opening in silent screams that echo in your mind long after you’ve looked away.

Then you spot it: a crack in the sky. Not a thunderhead or a storm front, but a jagged fissure of pure, starless void, like a wound torn into the fabric of reality. Through it seeps a cold fog, undulating down the avenue, blacker than oblivion yet teeming with microscopic motes of phosphorescent blue—like spores from another dimension. The fog drapes itself around traffic lights, snuffing them out one by one, and the rumble of unseen machinery reverberates through the pavement beneath your shoes.

Your pulse pounds in your ears as you race to the nearest intersection, trembling hands waving at passersby. “It’s coming!” you shout, but your voice is swallowed by the hum of distant generators and the indifferent chatter of late-night strollers. A flock of pale, winged rodents—creatures you’ve never seen outside fevered dreams—dart across the square, their wings slicing the air in rapid beats. You realize they’re fleeing the same encroaching fog, their tiny claws scrabbling at your calves as they brush past.

A sudden tremor ripples through the ground, sending puffs of dust up from manhole covers. The street beneath you flexes like living flesh, asphalt folding over itself in rippling waves. Street signs twist into grotesque totems: “Stop,” “Yield,” “One Way”—all merging into a single word you can’t quite decipher, like a prophecy half-erased by time. Your breathing grows ragged; sweat beads across your forehead despite the cool night air. Somewhere, far above, a chime rings—an otherworldly alarm tolling five long notes, each one resonating in your chest like the tolling of a cathedral bell before a cataclysm.

Ignoring the ache in your legs and the scream in your chest, you tear down a side street, chasing the last flicker of life: a neon emergency exit sign over an old theater. Its doors stand slightly ajar, light spilling out in angry streaks of vermilion. You fling yourself inside, slamming the door just as the fog’s leading edge curls in through the threshold, tendrils reaching hungrily for warmth, for breath. Behind you, the world outside dissolves into a silent night drowned in ink.

Inside the theater’s cavernous lobby, rows of reclining seats face a colossal screen framed in tarnished gold leaf. The screen crackles, then coalesces—images of your own terrified face morphing into a map, lines branching out like rivers converging on a single point. Your own voice echoes from the speakers, urging evacuation, warning of the void that’s hungry to swallow cities whole. You press your palm to the cool velvet of a seatback and realize: this theater is more than a sanctuary—it’s the final warning bell. And before you can decide whether to flee again or stand and sound the alarm, every exit sign in the room ignites in furious red, spelling out a single word that hangs in the smoky air: RUN.
