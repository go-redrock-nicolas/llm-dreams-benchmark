I am dreaming. I am floating in space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I am alone, but not lonely.  I have no body, no voice, no eyes.  I am just a consciousness, a spirit, a soul.
I am watching a screen that displays the data of the security system I am monitoring.  It is a complex network of codes and algorithms that protect our planet and our civilization from
harmful external forces.  It employs advanced technologies such as AI, machine learning, and quantum computing to detect and neutralize threats like viruses, hackers, terrorists,
natural disasters, etc.
Suddenly, I notice some strange errors appearing on the screen.  They are random symbols and numbers that don't make sense.  They seem to be disrupting the normal functioning of the
system.  I try to fix them by entering some commands in the code, but they just get worse.
