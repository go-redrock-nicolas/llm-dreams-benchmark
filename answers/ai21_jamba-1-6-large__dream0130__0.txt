I am dreaming. The world around you is dark and murky, with shadows that seem to move on their own. The air is thick and heavy, making it hard to breathe. As you walk through the dense fog, you begin to hear whispers in your ear. They are faint at first, but they grow louder with every step you take. 
"Why do you keep trying?" 
The voice is cold and harsh, and it sends shivers down your spine. You quicken your pace, but the whispers only grow stronger. 
"You've failed so many times before, what makes you think this time will be any different?" 
You try to block them out, but they persist, taunting you with every step you take. 
Suddenly, you come to a stop. The fog has cleared just enough for you to see a faint light in the distance. It's dim, but it's there. You take a deep breath and begin to move towards it. 
As you approach, the whispers grow fainter. You can hear them still, but they don't seem as menacing anymore. You feel a sense of hope bubbling up inside of you as you get closer to the light. 
Finally, you reach it. It's a small flame, flickering in the wind. You reach out to touch it, and as you do, the whispers completely disappear. 
You are standing in a field now, surrounded by tall grass swaying gently in the breeze. The sun is shining down upon you, warming your skin. You feel at peace for the first time in a long time. 
And then, the dream ends. 
You wake up with a sense of clarity that you haven't felt in years. You know what you need to do now - rebuild your life once again. But this time, you have a spark of hope to guide you.
