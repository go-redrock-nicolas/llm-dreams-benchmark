I am dreaming. The sunlight streaming through my office window suddenly feels artificial, too golden and thick like honey dripping down the glass. My watch ticks with an oppressive loudness that seems to reverberate through my bones - 59 minutes remaining. The knowledge sits heavy in my chest, a leaden weight of certainty that something monumental and terrible approaches.

I try telling my coworkers, but their faces blur and shift like oil on water as they laugh off my desperate warnings. "You're so dramatic," they say, voices echoing strangely as if spoken underwater. Their casual dismissals feel surreal against the electric tension in the air that only I seem to notice.

58 minutes now. The potted plant in the corner is growing visibly, its leaves unfurling in time with my quickening heartbeat. Outside the window, clouds race across the sky at impossible speeds, forming shapes that look almost like countdown numbers. Every time I blink, the shadows in the room have shifted slightly, as if reality itself is becoming unstable.

I maintain my composure outwardly, straightening papers on my desk with trembling hands, but inside I'm screaming. The water cooler bubbles ominously in the corner, each burst of air feeling like a countdown. When I glance at my phone to try calling authorities, the numbers on the screen keep rearranging themselves into warnings that dissolve before I can fully read them.

52 minutes left. The walls seem to be breathing now, subtle pulses that match the ticking of my watch. My colleagues continue their normal routines, but their movements are becoming jerky and mechanical, like malfunctioning automatons. I can see faint traces of something vast and dark beginning to seep through the cracks in the ceiling, but when I point it out, they only see ordinary water stains.

The weight of this knowledge, this terrible certainty, makes each remaining minute feel like an eternity. Yet paradoxically, time also seems to be accelerating, reality bending around the approaching catastrophe like light around a black hole. All I can do is straighten my tie, respond to emails with steady hands, and watch as the very fabric of existence begins to unravel at the edges of my vision...
