I am dreaming. I enter a serene sanctuary, bathed in hues of lavender and gold. The walls seem to breathe a gentle warmth, and ethereal music drifts through the air, as though plucked from a celestial harp. Lanterns hover around me, casting a soft glow on the faces of those gathered in this sacred space. We are all seekers of solace, bound by shared yet unspoken wounds.

As I take my place in the circle, I notice that the others' eyes reflect my own longing—for closure, for peace. A soft voice invites us to share our most vulnerable experiences, assuring us that the sanctuary is a judgment-free haven.

At first, my chest feels tight, my heart aflutter with uncertainty. But as I look around, I recognize the safety of this moment. I close my eyes, drawing a deep breath. "I have never known peace," I begin, my voice as hesitant as a fawn's first steps. "My mind often feels like a battlefield, where shadows and light clash in endless discord. I fear my past will define me, but I long to reclaim myself."

As I speak, I feel the weight in my chest begin to lift. The room hums with support, and I realize that the woman beside me is wiping away a tear. The man across from me nods, as if saying, I understand.

When the session ends, I leave with my shoulders straighter, my heart lighter. The sanctuary dissolves into the mists of my dream, but its essence lingers—a reminder that healing is a journey best traveled together.
