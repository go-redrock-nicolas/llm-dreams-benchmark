I am dreaming. You find yourself in an opulent boardroom, the air thick with tension and secrets. Above, a massive crystal chandelier casts fractured prisms across the polished mahogany table, the light dancing unnervingly like caught whispers. Around you sits an eclectic assembly - international diplomats in tailored suits, their faces like clay masks concealing tempestuous internal monologues. Monks in saffron robes finger prayer beads of onion skin thin; corporate titans barrel-chested, legs illegally crossed. The absurdity is not lost on you.

You are presiding, and the burden of revelation weighs heavy on your shoulders. Each participant throws coded barbs across the table - ciphers meant to obfuscate motivation but translucent and obvious to your black mirror of a mind.

Through granular subterfuge, fragmented truths begin to unfurl. And what truths they are... Neat far right empires and Soviet-vintage debt slave cabals; century old arms dealer dynasties; $10 a day internet addict junkie exploitation rings; despots using International Aid dollars to build palaces of gold and whale penis libido enhancing supplements (this is the part of the dream where you can practically taste the absurdity, the copper and devastation). All concocted for legitimacy heaped upon a mountain of dying. 

What (if anything) is sanity? You ask yourself, in this Twighlight Zone episode where nothing is close to the daylight we all think we know. Conveniently, this question summons a neat white box into existence at your elbow containing the dual cartridge prophecy pills necessary to gracefully exit this Jose MuERTo nightmare.

The weary decision has arrived: Pills in LA LA Land fantasy fulfillment or continue? Have you already been swallowed by some EcoTripping meme monster since the dream began? Questions, always more questions, it will never end. 

You open the white box and reveal...?
