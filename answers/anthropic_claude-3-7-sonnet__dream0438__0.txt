I am dreaming. I find myself wandering through an ancient library that exists somewhere between reality and imagination. The ceiling stretches impossibly high, disappearing into a swirl of cosmic clouds that occasionally rain down glittering stardust onto the endless shelves. Books of all sizes line these mahogany shelves—some bound in materials I recognize, others in substances that seem to breathe and pulse with life.

I didn't come here seeking solace. I was simply curious, following the trail of a fallen star I'd glimpsed through my bedroom window just before sleep claimed me. Yet as my fingers brush against the spines of these volumes, each touch releases a cascade of emotional memories I'd long suppressed.

A small book bound in what appears to be whale song and morning fog falls into my hands. When I open it, instead of pages, there's a reflecting pool showing moments from my childhood—pure joy, forgotten heartaches, the simple wonder I once felt at everyday miracles. Tears stream down my face, though in this dream-state, they transform into tiny silver fish that swim away through the air.

Further along, I discover a reading grove where enormous mushrooms serve as chairs, their caps glowing with soft bioluminescence. An elderly librarian with stars for eyes and skin like ancient parchment nods to me. "Most come seeking knowledge," she whispers in a voice like autumn leaves rustling. "Few discover they truly came for healing."

I spend what feels like centuries there, reading stories—some my own, some belonging to people I've never met but somehow understand completely. With each narrative absorbed, knots of tension I didn't know I carried unravel from my spirit.

When I finally look up, the library has transformed into an endless beach where the ocean's waves write poetry in the sand before erasing it with the next surge. The emotional weight I've carried for years has dissolved, replaced by a profound sense of acceptance and wonder.

I never intended this journey to be therapeutic. I simply followed curiosity into dreaming. Yet here, amidst impossible architecture and living stories, I've found pieces of myself I didn't know were missing.
