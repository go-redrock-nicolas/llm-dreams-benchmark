I am dreaming.

The world shimmers in a thousand subtle gradients of purple and gold. Soft clouds underfoot pulse with a slow heartbeat, vibrating comfortingly with each step I take. All around, impossibly tall sunflowers nod gently, their faces tracking not the sun, but my own gaze—friendly, encouraging, impossibly warm.

Yet, behind this intoxicating beauty, a ripple of anxiety persists. Even as feather-light breezes promise serenity, I feel a faint, persistent tension, as though at any moment the sky might darken or the ground might dissolve. I recognize this old feeling—expecting shadows at the height of sunlight, bracing against joy itself.

I stop and take a breath, the air thick with the scent of honey and distant rain. Instead of turning away from comfort, I step further in, deeper. With each exhale, I acknowledge my discomfort, tracing its origins like a curious child touches the shells scattered at the shoreline.

From the sapphire lake ahead, gentle music lifts—a chorus of distant voices weaving silken threads of positive memories: laughter around a sun-dappled table, the pride of a mountain summit, the peace of being held. I let them swirl around me, warm and buoyant, wrapping my anxiety not in denial but in gentle acceptance.

I see reflected in the lake not the storm I fear but the faces and smiles and affirmations I have gathered like rare gems. I reach out and find that the anxious ache lessens, dissolving into the golden light. Even here, in the heart of a dream, I understand I can choose to lean into joy, knowing that being open to good things doesn’t tempt fate, but welcomes life’s fullness.

In this moment, surrounded by living light and music, I make a promise to trust good fortune—to let myself rest, if only a little, upon the softness of hope.
