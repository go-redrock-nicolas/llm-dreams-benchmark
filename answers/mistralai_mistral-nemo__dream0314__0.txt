I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering lake, the water so still it mirrors the night sky above like a mystic, inky tapestry. A gentle breeze whispers through the reeds, carrying with it a melody, soft and regretful, reminiscent of a song sung long ago.

Before me, the lake parts, not with a rush of water, but slowly, gracefully, like a curtain drawn back by the hand of some celestial being. From the depths emerges a figure, draped in robes of silver and peat, her hair a cascade of dark waves, a crown of antlers upon her brow. It is Cernunnos, the Stag God, but here, in this dream, She is Cygnis, the Lady of the Lake.

She gazes at me with eyes like twin moons, and speaks in a voice that echoes like thunder, yet feels like a caress. "Come, child," She says, "The wheel turns, and the old ways are needed again." She beckons me with one ethereal hand, her fingers lengthening into swans' necks, adorned with rings of gold.

Following Her, I step into the lake, but the water does not chill me. Instead, it feels alive, like a prudent friend greeting an old acquaintance. I walk towards Cygnis, and as I do, symbols appear around us, floating in the air like stars: a spear, a raven, a boat, a wolf, a dragon. These are the sigils of the Tuatha DÃ© Danann, the ancient Trinity of Ireland.

Cygnis takes the spear, Luin, and presses its butt into my hand. "This is your lineage," She says, "The blood of heroes and kings." The spear hums, vibrating with power, and I feel my heart swelling with courage. Next, She grabs the raven, Bran, and places him on my shoulder. "Cunning and wisdom, all-seeing in darkness," She whispers, and Bran's eyes gleam, seeing things I cannot.

I reach for the boat, thepublished Bundle, when Cygnis stops me. "Not yet, child," She says, "That journey is for another life." I nod, respecting Her wisdom, and turn my attention to the wolf, Maccu. "Fierce and loyal, a true friend," She says, and Maccu licks my hand, his eyes promisingProtection, bravery.

Finally, there's the dragon, Nidd, curled around Cygnis, his scales glinting like tarnished silver. "Draft," Cygnis says, "Protection, ancient knowledge, a path to power." I reach out tentatively, and Nidd allows me to stroke his snout. He's warm, his breath trembling against my palm.

Cygnis looks at me, Her eyes shining with pride and anticipation. "Remember, child," She says, "The old ways are coming, and you are the river between the realms. You are needed."

The lake begins to churn, the symbols scattering, and Cygnis starts to recede, Her form blurring. Around me, the water grows dark, and the moon above wobbles, its reflection breaking. I hold onto Luin, feeling its power pulsating, as the lake swallows me, and I am snatched from the dream.
