I am dreaming. …find yourself standing backstage, enveloped by velvety crimson curtains that billow in a wind no one else seems to feel. Stark lights blaze beyond the curtain’s edge, illuminating a vast auditorium packed with faceless silhouettes. Their heads tilt upward in anticipation, as if they’re waiting for you to emerge at any moment. 

A heavy piano chord echoes in the distance—an ominous soundtrack that bubbles up from an invisible source. Each chord resonates through your feet, making the floor tremble. Palms sweating, you clutch a bundle of papers in your hand. Strangely, they feel weightless, as if the laws of gravity don’t apply. The typewritten text on these pages flickers and rearranges every time you blink. No matter how hard you stare, you can’t pin down the precise words of your speech.

Out of nowhere, an apparition drifts past—the shadowy outline of a past mentor. They whisper advice you can’t quite decipher—words bleed into echoes, twisting and turning until they become incomprehensible. A wave of panic surges through your chest. You take a breath and push aside the silky curtain, stepping onto the stage.

Under the bright lights, you realize the auditorium has warped into an enormous, marble-walled library. Towering shelves circle around you in impossible geometry, spiraling upward beyond the horizon. The faceless figures are gone, replaced by giant mirrors that reflect your anxious expression back at you from every angle. In each reflection, your posture slumps a bit more, your face contorts with unspoken dread.

Suddenly, the distant piano chord morphs into thunderous applause—a deafening roar that floods your ears. You haven’t uttered a single word, yet the applause rages on, relentless and mocking. Your heart thrums against your rib cage, and you prepare to speak. You know this speech matters more than anything—each word feels like a life-altering choice. 

As your mouth opens, all the mirrors shatter at once, fragments raining down in a storm of glittering shards. The applause halts abruptly, leaving a mysterious hush that feels like the whole world is holding its breath. In the echoing silence, you try to recall your first sentence. The pages in your hands dissolve into a fine dust that slips through your fingers. The dust catches an unseen gust of wind and spirals up into the library’s endless heights, twinkling like scattered stars.

Your chest tightens. The fear threatens to paralyze you, your mind looping with intrusive thoughts that hiss: “What if you fail?” “How will everybody judge you?” “Is this your final chance?” Their voices swirl around until they fuse into one echo, hammering away at your resolve. You sense the ground shifting beneath you, as if the entire library is tipping on its side, books flying from their shelves like startled birds.

Your sense of time warps—seconds feel like hours—and adrenaline overtakes your limbs as you lunge for a single tattered volume that soars past. Desperate to regain control, you clutch the old book against your chest. Its cover is stamped with golden letters you don’t recognize, letters that shift and reshape like living things. Beyond the cacophony of tumbling shelves and shrieking winds, a soft voice inside you whispers: “Speak from the heart.” 

And so you do. You lift your head, plant your feet, and let the words flow—no memorized script, no practiced lines, just raw truth. The swirling storm of chaos quiets. The library steadies, the shattered mirrors reform into smooth glass, and the echoing illusions dissipate like fog. Somehow, you know you’ve found your voice. 

In that moment of clarity, threads of moonlight shine through a newly formed skylight overhead, illuminating your trembling figure. Something settles in your chest—hope, confidence, or realization—and you become certain of one thing: all those intrusive thoughts pale next to your sudden conviction that you, at last, are ready. Then you wake—heart pounding, but unburdened, still tasting the triumph of having conquered your fear in the strange, shifting corridors of your own dream.
