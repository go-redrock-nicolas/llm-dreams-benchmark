I am dreaming.

As I cross the threshold into the softly lit venue, a shimmering warmth—almost golden—swims over my skin, like light filtering through honey. The grand hall looks both familiar and foreign, stretching endlessly, ceilings decorated with the constellations of my childhood. Each table glows under lanterns made from woven memories: laughter that once echoed down unswept school corridors, the scent of after-rain grass from lazy summer afternoons, whispers exchanged beneath autumn trees.

The crowd seems to pulse, a living mosaic of faces wrapped in time. There’s Eric, whose laughter used to spark inside me like wild electricity, but who left things unspoken the last time we met. There’s Maya, her eyes searching the crowd anxiously, hiding secrets behind her slow, unsure smile. Every face is a reflection of unresolved chapters, a tapestry of apologies that never found their way to the surface.

As I step forward, the floor beneath me undulates gently—like walking across a sea of childhood and regret. Conversations shimmer in the air, overlain with the soft music of nostalgia. Someone waves—a gesture tentative, haunted by words left unsaid years ago. My heart ricochets wildly, recognizing the ache of endings that never closed properly.

I feel the press of the past on my shoulders, bittersweet and heavy. The air tastes of citrus and old hope. Shadows lengthen at the edges of the room, swirling together like spilled ink—memories threatening to weigh me down. 

Then, from somewhere near the bar, I hear a burst of familiar laughter—unmistakable, bright, and unburdened. It slices through the anxiety, drawing a thread of courage through my chest. Emboldened, I weave through the crowd, faces blurring into impressionistic splashes of color. Words long-rehearsed in lonely bedrooms begin to rise to my lips, shimmering with the possibility of forgiveness and the electric sting of truth. 

In this dream-palace of memory and longing, I am both terrified and free—a tightrope walker in a cathedral of lost time, ready once more to meet what was left behind.
