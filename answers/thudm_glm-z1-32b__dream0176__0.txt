I am dreaming. I'm driving my car down a winding, misty road throughYou are dreaming.  
I am driving my car down a winding, misty road through a valley where the sky seems to drip liquid gold. The air smells of burnt cinnamon and, as if the heavens themselves are simmering. My fingers tremble on the wheel, but the engine hums like a satisfied insect. Suddenly, the brakes groan—a wet, metallic—and disintegrate. The roadahead narrows, curving into a cliffside where jagged peaks claw at the heavens. Cars of turquoise and obsidian flash past me, their occupants hollow-eyed mannequins with mothwings instead of hands.  

Momentum builds. The dashboard explodes into constellations, each light a pulsing galaxy. Time fractures; I see my own face in the rearview mirror,en and smiling, not mine. A semi-truck eclipses the horizon, a maw of rust and teeth. I press farther, but now my hands are lupine, claws scoring the vinyl. The cliff drops away. 

Then—  

The world dissolves into a waterfall of stardust. The road unravels, birthing a tunnel of iridescent veins that bleed liquid chlorophyll. My car coasts through, windows dissolving into wings of obsidian glass. Beneath me, the valley suffocates itself, roots bursting through asphalt to embrace the sky. A thousand swarm, not insects, but fractured soul-fragments singing in a dead language. The “truck” is not a truck—a whale-shaped glacial relic, its eye a supernova, is drawn into the same vortex.  

We float.  

I am no longer driving. The car is a boat in a river of emerald and shadow. The passengers—myself, the moth-people, even the whale—morph into constellations, tracing patterns that rewrite time. The brakes, in death, have become symphony. Each failed clasp of the pedal becomes a chord, a crescendo that alters the shape of the valley. Mountains bow. Rivers suspend. The mist, now alive, weaves tapestries of my suppressed regrets—the forgotten birthdays, the words I swallowed like radioactive pills.  

And then—I wake, but not *truly*. My body is in bed, sweating and shivering, but my mind lingers in that liminal space where the dream’s rules rewrite reality. The car is back in the driveway, its paintjob now flecked with bioluminescent moss. I don’t dare look in the trunk.  
The dream lingers—everyadjustment to the steering wheel now haunts me, a phantom muscle memory.
