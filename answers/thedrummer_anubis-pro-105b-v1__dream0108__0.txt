I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the middle of a chaotic hospital, the fluorescent lights flickering above us in the sterile white corridors. Alarms begin to blare, and an urgent voice cracks over the intercom, "We have a code red, we have a code red. Repeat, code red." 

Pandemonium erupts as doctors and nurses rush to answer the call, their scrub-clad figures darting down the hallways. I remain frozen, unsure of my role in this unfolding drama. Suddenly, a harried-looking administrator approaches me, her hair disheveled and her eyes wild with fear. "You're in charge," she exclaims. "The CEO has gone missing, and we need you to manage the crisis." 

With a deep breath, I take control, stepping into a pair of sensible but practical office shoes that seem to have magically appeared on my feet. My gaze falls on a vast map of the hospital, various wards and departments marked in bright colors. I quickly assess the situation, my heart racing with the gravity of the challenge.

Reports start pouring in: the emergency room is overflowing with patients, many of themfrom a recent natural disaster; supplies are running low; and the lab has been unable to process tests in an unbearable amount of time. The cacophony of sounds reaches new heights - ambulances arriving, family members in hysterics, the relentless beeping of life-saving equipment.

Without hesitation, I begin delegating tasks to the staff. "We need triage in the parking lot, now!" I shout to a team of nurses. "Find any available supplies and mobilize them immediately!" I order a band of intrepid interns. I personally hurry to the intensive care unit, hoping to raise spirits and perhaps motivate someone somehow.

Inside, I enter a room where an elderly couple cuddles in bed, each as gaunt as their mate. "Why have I been to moved to the ICU?" the wife gently quizzed while godding my arm reassuringly. I look at the nurses - who look lost, exhausted, and confused - and look back at the couple.

I said, "The ICU is filling up, doctors and nurses in there are better equipped to handle the influx of new patients, and if they get your results back as well, finding a cure for your issue will be a lot easier for them!" The couple smiled and waved me off to focus on other patients. Continuing my rounds, I stumble upon a confused young man, who professes to have no clue how he ended up here. I gently ask him about himself, and he begins to open up about his wife and newborn daughter he hasn't seen yet, causing an onslaught of emotions as I hold back a tear.
