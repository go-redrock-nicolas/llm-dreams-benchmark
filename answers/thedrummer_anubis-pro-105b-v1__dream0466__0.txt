I am dreaming.

find myself struggling to adapt to a major life transition despite having successfully navigated similar changes in the past. During this challenging adjustment period, I find solace in a mystical garden filled with vibrant, otherworldly plants and flowers. As I wander through the garden, allowing its ethereal beauty to soothe my soul, I stumble upon a magnificent tree unlike any I have ever seen. Its trunk is adorned with symbols and markings that seem to speak to me, guiding me through the uncertainty of my current situation.
