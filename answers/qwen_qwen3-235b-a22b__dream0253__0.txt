I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of ozone and burning cedar, as if the sky itself has been set ablaze. You stand at the edge of a vast, circular arena carved into the heart of a mountain, its stone tiers rising like the ribs of some ancient, slumbering beast. Below, a sea of faceless figures murmurs in a language that slithers through your bones. They are here to witness your second chance. The thing you once bungled in front of the world. The thing that haunts you still.  

Your palms are slick with sweat, your pulse a frantic drumbeat in your throat. The memory flickers like a broken film reel: *the stumble, the silence, the laughter that erupted like a thunderclap as you fell*. You’d been juggling fire then, hadn’t you? Or was it fragile glass orbs, each one shattering to reveal a secret you’d sworn to keep? The details blur, but the humiliation is as sharp as a blade.  

A gong sounds—a sound like a star collapsing—and the arena shifts. The ground beneath you becomes a mirror, reflecting not your face, but a thousand versions of you: younger, older, triumphant, defeated. One version sobs silently, another laughs maniacally, a third dissolves into smoke. You step forward, and the mirror cracks, splintering into a bridge of jagged light that stretches toward a floating platform. On it rests the object of your redo—a sphere of liquid starlight, humming with possibility.  

As you cross the bridge, the crowd’s whispers crystallize into voices. *“Failure.” “Clown.” “You’ll never get it right.”* The wind whips at you, carrying shards of your past mistakes—a torn diploma, a crumpled love letter, a medal slipping from your grasp. Your legs tremble, but you press on, the sphere pulsing brighter with each step. When you reach it, your fingers sink into its surface like water, and suddenly you’re *there*: back in the moment of your original failure, but this time, the world is slowed to honey.  

The crowd’s jeers stretch into elongated moans. The fire/glass/orbs hang suspended midair. You see it now—the misstep, the miscalculation, the fear that tripped you. Time snaps back to speed. You move. Your hands carve arcs through the air, not just performing, but *conversing* with the elements. The fire obeys. The glass bends but does not break. The crowd’s hostility twists into a gasp, then a roar—not of ridicule, but awe.  

Above, the stormy sky unravels. Threads of gold and indigo weave into a tapestry of constellations you’ve never seen, each star blinking in rhythm with your heartbeat. The arena trembles, and as you catch the final orb, the mirror beneath you reforms into a lake of liquid mercury. You leap, and instead of drowning, you rise—your reflection now a figure crowned with flame and shadow, whole and unbroken.  

The dream dissolves as the crowd chants your name, not as a taunt, but as a hymn. You wake with salt on your lips and the echo of wings in your chest. The past is not a cage, you realize. It’s a loom. And you are the weaver now.
