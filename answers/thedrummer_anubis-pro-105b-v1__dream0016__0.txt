I am dreaming. Slowly open my eyes, blinking away the fuzziness from the never-ending travel saga I've been trapped in. The harsh fluorescent lights of the airport lounge hit my face like a slap of reality from the peaceful slumber I was hoping to escape into just moments prior. As my gaze wanders across the sterile, empty seats scattered around the waiting area, my mind begins to catch up with the exhaustion-riddled body I'm housed in. 

This conference I've been preparing to speak at for months was supposed to be a defining moment in my career. Finally, the chance to share my hard-earned research with the world and make a name for myself in the industry. But now, as I watch the minutes tick by on my battered old watch and see the scheduled departure time of my connecting flight slipping further away, a dark cloud of anxiety begins to form over my head.

Each tick of the watch feels like an eternity, my gut twisting tighter and tighter with fear and desperation. How can this be happening? Not now, not today, not after everything I've put into this. The risk of missing the conference entirely begins to rear its ugly head, filling me with a sense of dread and panic rising in my chest. I glance around frantically for a customer service desk or line - I need answers, I need reassurance that this flight will take off soon. 

I will I reach the conference on time? Will my life-changing speech be reduced to a distant memory, overcome by the impending doom of a missed flight? With a deep breath, I push myself up from the hard plastic chair and begin my search for some semblance of good news amidst the swirling chaos of the airport. 

It is 9:43PM, my connecting flight is supposed to be leaving now, but all I can do is stare at the taunting "Delayed" display on the departure board and wonder what the future holds.
