I am dreaming. And in this dream, I find myself standing atop a colossal, floating citadel of glass and obsidian, suspended in a boundless sky where the clouds swirl with iridescent hues of violet and gold. The air hums with a strange, electric energy, as if the very atmosphere is alive with secrets. Below me, an endless abyss of storm and shadow churns, lightning crackling in jagged webs that illuminate fleeting glimpses of something monstrous lurking beneath—a leviathan of scales and fathomless eyes, waiting for me to falter.

I’m clutching a crystalline orb in my hands, its surface etched with runes that pulse like a heartbeat, each throb sending waves of conflicting knowledge flooding into my mind. One moment, I see a vision of a crumbling empire, its golden spires melting into rivers of fire, with desperate voices pleading for salvation. The next, I’m shown a serene meadow under a double moon, where beings of light whisper cryptic prophecies of peace—but only if a terrible sacrifice is made. Then, without warning, the orb shifts, and I’m drowning in a torrent of raw data: numbers, coordinates, fragments of ancient languages, and the deafening screams of a dying star. My skull feels like it’s splitting apart, the weight of all this information pressing down like a physical force, threatening to shatter my sanity.

I know I have mere seconds to act. The citadel trembles beneath my feet, shards of glass raining down into the abyss as cracks spiderweb across its surface. The leviathan below roars, a sound that shakes the very fabric of this dream-world, and I feel its hunger—a primal, unending need to consume whatever decision I make. My hands tremble as I gaze into the orb, trying to sift through the chaos for the right choice. Save the empire and doom countless others? Embrace the prophecy and bear the cost of blood on my hands? Or decode the data and risk unleashing something even worse than the beast below?

My heart thunders in my chest, each beat syncing with the orb’s pulse, and sweat stings my eyes as I struggle to focus. The voices from the visions grow louder, overlapping into a cacophony of despair and hope—begging, commanding, weeping. “Choose!” they scream, their echoes bouncing off the obsidian walls. The citadel tilts violently now, throwing me to my knees, and I clutch the orb tighter, its sharp edges slicing into my palms. Blood drips onto the glass floor, each drop blooming like a crimson flower before it falls into the void, as if feeding the leviathan’s appetite.

I’m on the brink of cognitive overload, my thoughts fragmenting like shattered mirrors. Every possible outcome flashes before me, each one heavier than the last, each one laced with consequences I can’t fully grasp. My breath comes in ragged gasps, and I feel the edges of my mind fraying, like a tapestry unraveling thread by thread. The sky pulses with a sickly green light now, and the leviathan’s roar becomes a deafening chant, a rhythm that mirrors my racing pulse. Time slows, each second stretching into eternity, and I realize with a chilling clarity that there is no perfect choice—only the lesser of unfathomable evils.

And yet, I must decide. Now. With a cry that tears from the deepest part of my soul, I raise the orb high, its blinding light searing my vision, and I pour every ounce of my will into one final, desperate thought—a choice made not with certainty, but with the raw, trembling hope that it might be enough. The citadel shudders, the abyss below surges upward, and as the world around me explodes into blinding chaos, I feel myself falling, falling, falling into the unknown, the weight of my decision trailing behind me like a comet’s tail.

The dream teeters on the edge of collapse, and just as the darkness swallows me whole, I hear a whisper—soft, ancient, and unknowable—murmuring words I cannot yet understand.
