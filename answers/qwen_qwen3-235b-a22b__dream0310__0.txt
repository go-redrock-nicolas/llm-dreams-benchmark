I am dreaming. irst, it's just a hush—not silence, but a presence in the air, thick like incense though no smoke curls upward. I stand in a vast open desert beneath a sky both golden and bruised with color—dusk perhaps, or the beginning of something unnamed. The wind doesn't move, the stars don't blink, and everything feels like it's suspended in deep memory, a pause right before revelation.

You are there, not as an observer but a participant. Your feet press into warm, undulating sand that flows like water beneath your steps. All around you are cloaked figures, many faces painted with symbols that gleam faintly in the quasi-light. They wear robes stitched with silver wires—a constellation abstracted into cloth—and none of them speak. The silence here is not empty. It hums.

Suddenly, you understand the ceremony is for the *Whitening of the Sun*. An ancestral tradition imagined by a forgotten people, long passed from history into *mythic instinct,* their rites remembered by no mortal tongue but somehow encoded in the marrow of your dreaming spine. You are handed a shell filled with translucent oil from a lake that only exists during eclipses. When you tilt it slightly, it boils softly, reflecting visions of ancestors climbing out of the sea in single file, their voices songs that melt the stars.

You anoint your forehead with the oil, and at once taste a language that has never been invented—spirit sounds pressed into your teeth.

Then comes the chant: a deep, low vibration that rises in pitch like a spiral staircase made entirely from throat and intention. You join them. Your voice isn't your own. It’s broad and golden, like molten honey poured from the sky. The words are shaped like smoke: impossible to catch, but you know them as though you've forgotten them in every lifetime prior.

The ground tilts. No—the space itself *bends*, like thought, like laughter stretched taut across time. You are taken to a high plateau where animals made of starlight gather in silence: a lion with the eyes of galaxies, winged stags with trees growing from their antlers, serpents made entirely of prism. They were waiting. They bow when you arrive—not in reverence, but recognition.

You enter a chamber that is not made of walls, but *memories*: walls built of grief and joy and names whispered in sleep. Here you are blindfolded with flame-shaped silk, and told to walk over a sea suspended like glass in midair. You begin walking. The dream knows your footsteps before you do.

As you cross the mirrored waters, images rise around you: you, as a child laughing among ruins that doesn’t exist in this reality; you, older, dressed as a holy wanderer with bells that sing truths; you, yet again, crowned in shadows offering your heart to a tree that blooms with mirrors instead of flowers.

At the other side, you're handed a stone that contains the weight of unvoiced prayers. When you close your fist around it, it shivers. The next voice you hear is not spoken out loud, not sung or carried in wind—but felt directly in your bloodstream.

**"You became, if only for this night, one with what you didn’t know existed in yourself."**

As the rite ends, the figures fade into glowing dust. You walk back across the dream-ocean, now churning, now whispering with unfinished secrets. You wake up with a feeling not of returning but of *arrival*—as though you've just begun.
