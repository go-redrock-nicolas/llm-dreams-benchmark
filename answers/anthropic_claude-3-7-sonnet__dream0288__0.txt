I am dreaming. I find myself suddenly standing at the edge of a city that defies physics and imagination. Skyscrapers curl like ribbons above me, their glass facades reflecting impossible colors that don't exist in waking life. The streets beneath my feet pulse with gentle luminescence, responding to my footsteps with ripples of amber light that spread outward like stones dropped in water.

The air tastes like memories—specifically the childhood recollection of eating wild berries by a stream, though I've never actually done this. Each breath fills my lungs with sensations rather than oxygen: nostalgia, anticipation, the peculiar comfort of déjà vu.

People move around me in curious ways, sometimes walking normally, sometimes floating inches above the ground, sometimes fragmenting into particles before reassembling elsewhere. Nobody seems alarmed by this. I realize I'm wearing clothes I've never owned—a coat made of material that shifts between feathers and autumn leaves, changing with my emotions.

In the distance, a massive clocktower stands at an impossible angle, its face displaying not numbers but phases of lives: childhood, discovery, love, loss, transformation. The hands move both clockwise and counterclockwise simultaneously. I understand, with dream-logic certainty, that I must reach this tower before the hands align.

As I navigate the streets, doorways appear in midair, opening to reveal scenes: an ocean where waves freeze in crystalline arches; a forest where trees communicate through pulses of colored light; a library where books read themselves aloud in whispers.

I feel no fear, only an overwhelming sense that I am exactly where I need to be, despite having no preparation for this world of beautiful impossibilities. Each step forward feels like remembering something essential I had forgotten about myself.
