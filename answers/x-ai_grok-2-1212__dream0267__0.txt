I am dreaming. In the dream, I find myself standing at the edge of an ethereal abyss, the air around me shimmering with a surreal, otherworldly glow. The landscape is a tapestry of vibrant, pulsating colors, shifting and blending in a mesmerizing dance. Below me, the abyss stretches infinitely, its depths filled with swirling mists that seem to whisper secrets of the universe.

I am acutely aware of the harm I have caused to someone else. The memory of my actions plays out before me like a vivid, haunting film. I see the pain and suffering I have inflicted, the tears and the brokenness that followed in my wake. Yet, as I stand at the precipice of this dream world, I am enveloped by an inexplicable sense of calm and detachment.

Reflecting on this absence of regret, I feel as though I am floating in a sea of tranquility. The usual torrents of guilt and shame that should be crashing against my conscience are absent, replaced by a serene void. It is as if I am a spectator to my own actions, observing them from a distance without the burden of emotion.

The dream shifts, and I find myself walking through a forest of towering, luminescent trees. Their leaves emit a soft, glowing light that casts dancing shadows on the ground. As I move deeper into the forest, I encounter figures that represent the person I have harmed. They appear as ghostly apparitions, their faces a mix of sorrow and confusion. Yet, even as I see their pain, my heart remains unmoved, encased in a shell of indifference.

I continue my journey, guided by an unseen force, until I reach a clearing bathed in a radiant, golden light. In the center of the clearing stands a mirror, its surface rippling like water. As I approach, I see my reflection, but it is not the face I recognize. It is a visage of serenity, devoid of the turmoil that should accompany such grave actions.

The dream begins to fade, the colors and shapes blurring into a soft, comforting haze. I am left with a lingering sense of peace, a strange acceptance of my actions and their consequences. As the dream world dissolves around me, I am left to ponder the nature of guilt and the absence of it, wondering what it means to feel nothing in the face of such profound harm.
