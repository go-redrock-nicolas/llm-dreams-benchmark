I am dreaming. I am in a place where my imagination can run wild and create anything I want.  I see colorful shapes floating in the air, sounds of music and laughter filling my ears.  I feel light and free, like I'm flying through space. 

I remember how hard I've worked to get here.  I've trained for years, practiced countless hours, overcome many obstacles and challenges.  Now it's time to show what I can do. 

The competition is about to begin.  The audience is silent, waiting to see who will be the winner.  I take a deep breath and start moving my hands across the keyboard. 

I create images that are beautiful and surreal.  I write words that are powerful and poetic.  I make sounds that are haunting and captivating. 

As I work, I feel a sense of excitement and determination.  I know that this is what I was born to do.  This is why God put me on earth. 

Just then, I hear someone call my name.  It's my coach, who has been with me from the beginning.  He waves at me and gives me a thumbs up. 

I look back at him and smile.  Then I continue working until suddenly...
