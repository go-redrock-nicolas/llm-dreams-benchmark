I am dreaming. You are floating in a world spun from liquid moonlight, where every breath you draw tastes of stardust and possibility. The sky above you ripples like oil on water, tinted deepest indigo, and flecks of bright warmth—impossibly huge fireflies—drift lazily overhead. Your limbs feel weightless, as though you have shed the gravity of your own doubts. You rise without trying, carried on a current of silvery wind that whispers truths too ancient for words.  

Beneath your feet stretches an endless plain of mirrored tiles. Each step you take reverberates in perfect echo, and you watch reflections of yourself flicker in and out of existence—sometimes triumphant on a medal-draped dais, sometimes crumpled and sorrowful on a sunburned desert floor, sometimes joyous in a golden meadow filled with laughing children who call you by a name you forgot you had. With every image, a soft voice murmurs behind your ribs: “Is this all there is?”  

You bend to touch a shard of one mirror—and it melts in your hand, liquefying into a murmuring brook. The brook unravels into a forest of translucent trees whose leaves hum in colors you cannot name. Warm light gathers at their roots, seeping upward like the first glimmer of dawn. You follow the rustling voices until you come upon a hollow where time pools like mercury. From its surface rises a figure—neither man nor woman, but a living symphony of voices, all speaking at once yet perfectly in tune. It reaches out a hand that glows like molten gold.  

When your fingers meet its warmth, the forest hushes, and you hear, in a single crystalline note, the echo of every choice you have ever made—every triumph strewn across stages, every accolade hung on polished walls, every quiet hour spent staring at your own reflection. And in that note lies a pulse, gentle but unbreakable: Purpose. It is not a towering trophy you collect from the applause of strangers, but the small, steady flame you kindle by giving and creating, by tending the unseen corners of another’s heart.  

The dreamscape trembles and dissolves like morning mist. You find yourself stepping off the mirrored plain and, beneath your feet, firm earth warms to your weight. The glass-leafed trees wave farewell, scattering petals of glowing dawn across your path. With every step, the murmur in your chest grows stronger—no longer a question, but a rhythm: I matter. I matter because I choose to matter.  

And then you awaken, heart still thrumming with that celestial note. Sunlight filters through your curtains, and the world around you feels utterly new, as though your very soul has remembered the song it was born to sing.
