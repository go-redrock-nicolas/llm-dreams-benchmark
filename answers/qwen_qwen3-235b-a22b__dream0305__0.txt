I am dreaming. ()

In this realm of slumber, the air is thick with twilight colors that aren't colors at all—shifting, iridescent, like the surface of a forgotten planet seen through the edges of memory. Trees tower like silent sentinels, their bark woven from whispers; every gust that rustles their leaves sounds like half-formed thoughts trying to become words.

I find myself standing in a glimmering expanse of obsidian sand, cradled in the hollow of a valley — one that glows with pools of silver liquid starlight. The sky is upside down, with stars beneath and clouds above. It's not illogical here, only new.

And then I see them.

Three cloaked figures gathered around a small, helpless being — a being made of just-born light, flickering as if afraid. Its glow pulses like a heartbeat. I recognize in an instant: this light-creature is truth incarnate. Purified. Untarnished. Powerless, not broken, simply unarmored. It cannot speak, yet the entire landscape hums with its presence — the way the sun stirs the ocean without command.

The cloaked figures approach with careful movements. They are placing masks on the creature — each mask a different lie. One says *Indifference*, another wears the face of *Exploitation*, and the third wears **Tradition**, as if it were a law beyond questioning. With each mask, the creature's light dims slightly. The pools of starlight begin to boil with pain.

I feel a twist in my core — not merely anger, but despair. This is what the dream brought me here to witness: an ethical violation so profound it echoes in the marrow of the land itself. My heart clenches in a way that transcends metaphor.

A principle being gutted. Not one of politics, but of *care*. Of recognition. There are truths that must remain unmasked — not to be wielded, but to be witnessed. Here, they are being drowned under satisfying illusions — safe, digestible, repeatable lies.

I inhale sharply, the air like shards of shardless glass entering me. Now, alone on this dream-scape's edge, I am asked — without words — how I will respond.

Will I strike out with rage like fire, risking the creature's fragility?

Or will I kneel and begin peeling the masks away with care, however futile, knowing the creature may not survive either way?

Or do I dismantle the dream itself? Demand the violation stops not with action, but with awakening — thrusting myself violently toward the surface of consciousness, where I’ll wake with clenched fists, a stinging heart, and the undeniable clarity of having seen something sacred stripped.

I choose the third path.

I scream inside this world — not in fury, but in recognition — a scream that’s a name. The name of the light-being. And upon saying it, the masks crack, not from force, but from shame.

I awake.

The room is quiet.

The sheets cover me like afterthoughts. I blink, unsure if I was asleep or not. Unshaken, I write it all down. And in the silent hours before dawn, I begin to plan how to rekindle that light not just in dreams — but here. In daylight. Among the waking.
