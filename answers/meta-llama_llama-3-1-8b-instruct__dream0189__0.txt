I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a velvety-smooth lake, surrounded by a whispering forest of towering sequoias that seem to stretch up to the velcro-like clouds. The air is alive with the sweet scent of moonflowers, their delicate petals glistening like shards of crystal in the soft, silvery light that filters through the canopy above.

As I breathe in, I feel the gentle caress of the lake's mist, carrying the secrets of the trees and the whispers of the past, which both soothe and stir my soul. The surface of the water reflects the perfect replica of the sky above, creating an ethereal sailboat pathway that seems to lead me deeper into the mystical realm of my subconscious.

Suddenly, a wispy voice calls out to me from the shadows of the forest, shattering the peaceful tranquility of this serene landscape. "You're not who you think you are," it whispers. The words sear my skin like a branding iron, and I feel an involuntary recoil in my chest, as if the sentinel of self-protection recognizes the threat before me.

My mind begins to spring into action, quickening to react like a rare, magnificent bird that spreads its stealthy wings and soars away from the snapping realizations of this painful truth. My rationalization is swift as the arrows of fate fly true, seeking tremulous tissues of safety, lubricating them with feeble counterarguments.

"Oh, this voice is just a cruel trickster, trying to unravel the intricate tapestry of my carefully spun identity," my defenses fling out, tussling with the specifications of self-delusion. "And what truth does it bring that's really of substance? Reducing me to something tinny and narrow, discriminating between whimsy and fact? My dreams are mine, willfully weaved and all reparisonship dear, perfectly justified to deliberately fence around blow out loose connections to deflect scattering tragic angles practicing circles diagonal cruelties!"
