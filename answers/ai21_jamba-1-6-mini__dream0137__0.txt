I am dreaming. You're selected to judge a high-profile corruption case where powerful forces are trying to influence the verdict. Despite increasing threats and pressure, you vow to uphold justice, sifting through the evidence with unwavering integrity. As the trial progresses, the courtroom becomes a battleground of whispers and innuendo, with whispers of bribes and backroom deals echoing in the corridors. Midway through the trial, you receive an ominous note warning you to change your stance or face dire consequences. Instead of retreating, you dig deeper, unearthing a hidden dossier that exposes the true extent of the corruption. The stakes are higher, and the courtroom drama intensifies. The defense attempts to discredit you, launching personal attacks that threaten your reputation and safety. Yet, you remain resolute, convinced that you must deliver a fair and just verdict. On the final day of the trial, after hours of deliberation, you deliver a landmark judgment that will either dismantle a corrupt network or reinforce its dominance. The tension in the room is palpable as you rise to announce your decision. And then, the dream fades, leaving you wondering if this fight for justice extends beyond the realm of imagination.
