I am dreaming. I am floating above a glassy black lake under a starless sky. The air smells like burnt sugar and static. My reflection in the water isn't mine—it's a shifting collage of faces I recognize: classmates, coworkers, strangers whose judgments etch themselves into my skin like brandings. A voice from the water murmurs, *"What do you demand from the world, if not adoration?"* 

Suddenly I’m standing in a grand marble hall lit by flickering gas lamps. Around me, thousands of tiny automaton figures with hollow eyes perform intricate bows and curtsies, their tinny laughter echoing off the walls. They chant in unison, *"You are worthy, you are irreplaceable."* But their joints clank and their smiles grate like fingernails on slate. 

I reach out to touch one—its metallic face melts into my own, then fractures into a grotesque parody. The floor tilts. The hall dissolves into a stormy garden where roses have razor-edged petals and the trees weep buckets of mercury. A figure emerges—my best friend, except their eyes are voids and their voice cracks like a porcelain doll’s: *"They only see what you refuse to show them."* 

I wake clutching the bedsheets, sweat sticky under my collar. The alarm clock glows red: 3:33 AM. I taste copper and regret.
