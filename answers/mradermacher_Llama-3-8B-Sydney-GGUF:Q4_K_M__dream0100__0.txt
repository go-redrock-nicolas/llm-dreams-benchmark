I am dreaming. I am in a world where my dreams can come true.  A world where I can be whoever I want to be, do whatever I want to do, and go wherever I want to go. 

I join a community of dreamers like me who share my same passions and interests.  We are all unique individuals with different personalities and backstories.  But we
have one thing in common: we believe that dreams can change reality for the better.

As I try to fit into this group, I notice some subtle cues that hint at underlying rules and norms that govern our society. 

For example, when I introduce myself, I use a code name instead of my real name because revealing too much information about myself could invite judgment or
discrimination from others who don't agree with our goals.

When I express my opinions, I do so respectfully and constructively by offering solutions rather than complaints.  This shows that I care about the well-being
