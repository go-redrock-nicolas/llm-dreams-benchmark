I am dreaming. I stand barefoot on a smooth, obsidian beach as twilight's final gasps of dusk dissipate. The relentless pull of social media withdrawls pulses in my fingertips, a phantom limb of unmet likes and unseen shares. Anxiety surges through me like a riptide of unease as I process the crushing reality of hours squandered in the digital void.

Behind me, a decrepit amusement park looms spectrally against the star-filled sky. Wild, tendrils of ivy crawl across rusted attractions, nature's slow-revenge on our technological obsessions. I can still hear the echoes of laughter and screams that once filled the air - perhaps the manic release of internet validation, now taunting me in its absence.

The sand at my feet gradually shifts, transforming into a sea of glowing smartphones. Their screens flicker to life, displaying the faces of digital avatars urging me to return to the endless scrolling, a siren song of curated perfection. My palms throb with phantom notifications. No, I resist, with the strength of desperation.
