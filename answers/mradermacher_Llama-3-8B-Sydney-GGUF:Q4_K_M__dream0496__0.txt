I am dreaming. I see colors and shapes that are not of this world.  I feel emotions that are beyond words.  I hear sounds that only my mind can comprehend.  

As I wander through this dream realm, I encounter various creatures and objects that challenge my notions of reality.  I engage them in conversation
and play with them as if they were real beings.  Sometimes I learn new things from them.  Sometimes I create new things with them.  

I also notice how differently I react to situations when I approach them with curiosity rather than judgment.  Instead of judging others, I ask questions about their origins and purposes.  Instead of criticizing myself, I explore my potential and possibilities.    

For example, instead of judging a strange object that floats in the air and changes shape constantly, I ask it "Hello, can we be friends?"  And then I listen to its reply with wonder and awe.  

Instead of criticizing myself for not being able to solve a puzzle that hinders my progress, I explore different strategies and approaches until I find one that works.  

I feel liberated and creative when I shift my mindset from judgment to curiosity.  I discover hidden meanings and connections between concepts that I never thought possible before.  

This is how I create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.
