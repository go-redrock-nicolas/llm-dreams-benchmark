I am dreaming. You step into a place where every boundary between states of matter dissolves under the glow of an amber sky. Ruby-red clouds swirl beneath you, drifting like cotton candy across a shifting, molten landscape. The air around you feels both weighty and light at the same time—warm whirls of mist brush past your face, yet solid gusts underfoot support your weight as you walk. Here, a single stone might glisten wetly, ooze at the edges, and then evaporate into a glimmering haze, all in the span of a heartbeat. This realm demands that you forget everything you once knew about what is solid or what can be held.

To navigate this multiphase environment, you discover a pair of shoes crafted from undulating crystal ribbons. The moment you slip them on, crystal bristles curl around your ankles, transforming to rose-colored vapor and then back to sculpted glass in one fluid transition. With each step, these living shoes adapt to the shifting terrain beneath you. You can press one foot onto a swirling lake of cerulean liquid only to have it crystallize momentarily under your sole. The next moment, it might dissolve into spiraling steam that lifts you onto the next plateau.

Ahead, a towering sculpture catches your eye—a floating mass of shimmering green, shaped like a swirl of seafoam whipped by a magician’s wand. Approach it, and its ghostly outlines ripple as they sense your presence. It offers you a translucent orb pulsing with violet luminescence. Within its pulsing core, you see swirling ribbons of energy that dance between solid, liquid, and vapor, echoing the very nature of this domain. Holding it in your hands, the orb’s substance expands and contracts with each of your breaths, forging a connection to your heartbeat.

As you move deeper into this impossible place, gold-veined waterfalls liquify into dancing droplets, and the roads beneath your feet fracture like clay only to melt back into glassy surfaces at the mere flex of your joints. Sounds are just as malleable as the objects themselves—a gentle hum flows across your ears, turning into the crackling of ice shards, then transmuting once more into the gentle whistle of steam. Each step forward is a fresh act of discovery, an invitation to reach beyond the limits of your perception—and in this dream realm, you gladly accept.
