I am dreaming. The sky above is not a sky at all—it is a vast, undulating membrane, pulsing like the inside of a colossal creature’s throat. Stars are not distant suns but glistening spores, drifting lazily in thick celestial sap. I stand on a bridge that is not stone, nor metal, but the rib of some long-dead leviathan, its curve stretching over an infinite chasm where shadows coil like serpents made of smoke.  

For days, or perhaps centuries, I have walked without walking, my feet barely touching the bone-white surface, my breath steady even as my insides twist into knots. I have been screaming without sound, my mouth sewn shut by invisible threads of restraint. No one here to see the fractures spreading beneath my skin—but now, the pressure is too much.  

A single drop of rain falls—no, not rain. It is dark and viscous, thick as ink, and when it strikes my forehead, something inside me *splinters*.  

The threads snap. My skin cracks like porcelain.  

From the fissures spills not blood, but light—liquid gold and violet, an unraveling storm of suppressed emotions given form. The bridge shudders. The membrane-sky peels back, revealing an eye, vast and lidless, its pupil shaped like a keyhole. The shadows in the abyss surge upward, whispering in tongues of rust and honey, and I realize—they are *my* words, the ones I swallowed for years.  

I open my mouth, and the sound that tears free is not a scream, but a *song*—a note so pure the world buckles under its weight. The bridge collapses, the spores ignite, and I fall—but the falling is flying, is freedom, is my ribs splitting open to release wings of shattered glass and sunlight.  

The eye blinks.  

And then—I wake.
