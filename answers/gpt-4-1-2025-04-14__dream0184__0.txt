I am dreaming. I find myself awakening on an endless plain beneath a lavender sky. The atmosphere shimmers with colors I do not know and cannot name, hues that pulse with the energy of reversed chance. A single thought crystallizes in my mind: the impossible is routine here, and the expected slips through my fingers like smoke. 

Before me, a path unfolds—a cobblestone road made not of stone, but of fragile, floating bubbles that seem doomed to burst beneath my feet. Yet, each time I dare to set weight on them, instead of shattering, they become solid as granite, supporting each uncertain step. I realize that in this universe where probability is inverted, confidence is the thing that topples certainty, and hesitation is what keeps structures firm.

I must function not by relying on what should happen, but by dancing along the wildest improbabilities. When hunger creeps in, the usual expectation—a meal upon request—fails. Instead, I learn to conjure a banquet by making bizarre requests aloud: "Let me dine on the laughter of a forgotten sunbeam!" And, miraculously, a shimmering platter appears, radiating warmth and joy that feeds me more fully than any earthly meal.

Here, familiar logic becomes a hindrance. I throw aside plans and embrace the nonsensical: to find shelter, I search not with my eyes but by holding my breath and spinning in place. Unlikely as it is, a door appears, hinged in the air itself, leading into a cozy space lined with books whose words rearrange themselves at random. Every time I reach for a certainty, it recedes; every time I court the inexplicable, the universe rushes in to fulfill it.

To exist here, I must become a maestro of mayhem, befriending chaos and letting go of all that was familiar. I navigate by imagining the strangest outcomes possible, and I am rewarded with gifts: a clock that ticks backward, granting me moments lost; a pen that writes dreams into the sky, each an unpredictable constellation; a companion in the form of a talking origami crane that dissolves into mist whenever I expect it to answer my questions.

And as I am swept up in this carnival of reversed probability, it dawns on me: the only certainty is surprise, and to thrive here, I must shed my need for the probable, embracing instead a vibrant tapestry woven from the threads of impossibility.
