I am dreaming. I'm a researcher working on developing technology that allows humans to communicate with animals through their dreams. I've figured out how to translate between sound and light patterns, but I need someone who can physically interact with both species. That's where you come in.
You are connected to two devicesâ€”one emitting light patterns and the other producing sounds. You must perform specific actions to trigger signals in your brain that will be translated into the other species' language. For example, when you see a bright flash of yellow light, you must say "hello" out loud or hum a melody, etc. When you hear a loud noise, you must imagine a color or shape, etc. You can also use your own creativity to come up with new ways of triggering the signals. The goal is to communicate meaningful messages that will strengthen the bond between the two species and help them coexist peacefully.
You are dreaming.
