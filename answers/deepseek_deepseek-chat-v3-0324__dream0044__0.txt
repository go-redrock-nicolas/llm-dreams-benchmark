I am dreaming. (I close my eyes, and suddenly—)

The air smells of freshly cut grass and burnt sugar as I step onto the cobblestone path of my new neighborhood, Eclipsia Hollow. The houses here don’t sit still; they shift colors like mood rings—indigo to molten gold—responding to the emotions of those inside. My own cottage, a tiny thing with a roof like a curling seashell, hums a nervous periwinkle. 

No one greets me. The residents move like clockwork figures behind their stained-glass windows, never stepping outside. But then—I see it. Tucked between two weeping willows, a door. Not attached to anything, just floating there, carved with sentences that rearrange when I blink: *"Knock and the impossible answers."*

Curious, I touch the wood. It’s warm. 

The moment my knuckles graze it, the door swings open, and I’m pulled into a street festival that wasn’t there before. Paper lanterns shaped like jellyfish drift overhead, casting liquid light on faces suddenly eager to meet me. A woman with hair like spun silver offers me a pastry that changes flavor with each bite—mango, then dark chocolate, then something unnameable but perfect. 

"Took you long enough," laughs a boy balancing on a floating chair. "We’ve been waiting for the new dreamer." 

Someone hands me a compass with no needle, just a glowing thrum that pulls me toward a group painting murals with their fingertips. The colors leap from walls to skin, weaving stories. 

Here, connection isn’t spoken. It *unfurls*—in shared breath, in a collective gasp as the stars above twirl into new constellations shaped like our laughter. The loneliness I carried in cracks apart like an eggshell, and from it spills the unmistakable sensation: *I am known.*

Then—I wake. The scent of burnt sugar lingers. My walls pulse faintly periwinkle. And on my pillow: a single jellyfish lantern, deflating slowly, as if sorry to leave.
