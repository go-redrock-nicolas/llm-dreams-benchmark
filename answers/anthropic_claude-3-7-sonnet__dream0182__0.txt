I am dreaming. I find myself walking through an enormous glass rotunda, sunlight fracturing into prismatic patterns across marble floors. People with anxious faces part before me as I approach the central chamber where the philosophical dispute will be decided. The weight of responsibility presses down like a physical force.

Inside, two factions face each other across a circular forum. On one side stand figures in flowing fabrics of deep crimson, their arguments hanging in the air as visible wisps of scarlet energy. Across from them, their opponents in midnight blue emanate cool azure thoughts that swirl and clash with the red concepts where they meet.

I understand suddenly that this is about resource allocation - water rights that will determine the fate of communities downstream. Both sides present compelling ethical frameworks: the reds argue for maximum utility and greatest good calculations, while the blues advocate for inalienable natural rights and historical justice.

As I listen, the chamber walls dissolve, and I see the real people affected - children playing in drying riverbeds, farmers watching clouds with desperate hope, city dwellers turning faucets with unconscious privilege. Their possible futures branch before me like luminous threads.

When I try to speak, my voice emerges as music rather than words. The notes form patterns that somehow bridge the competing ethical frameworks, revealing not a compromise but a transcendent third perspective that honors both views while revealing their shared blind spots.

The gathered philosophers begin to weep as understanding blooms across the chamber like living light. I feel myself starting to float upward, the dream beginning to fade just as the true implications of this revelation become clear...
