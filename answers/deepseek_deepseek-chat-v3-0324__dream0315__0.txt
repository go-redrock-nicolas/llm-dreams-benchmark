I am dreaming. A vast, endless sky stretches above me, painted in hues of twilight—deep purples, molten golds, and the faintest whispers of emerald. The air hums with an electric charge, as though the atmosphere itself is alive, breathing in time with my pulse.  

Beneath my feet, the ground is not solid but shifting—a liquid mirror reflecting fractured glimpses of other worlds. With each step, ripples distort the images: a towering library with books that whisper secrets, a labyrinth of thorns that twist and writhe like serpents, a bridge suspended over an abyss where shadows reach up with skeletal fingers.  

Then, the crows appear.  

They descend from the bleeding horizon, their feathers not black but iridescent, shimmering between sapphire and obsidian. One lands before me, tilting its head, and in its eyes, I see not bird but galaxy—swirling constellations, dying stars, the birth of new suns. It opens its beak, and instead of a caw, a voice—my own, yet not mine—echoes:  

*"You keep searching for answers in the wrong reflections."*  

Before I can respond, the ground gives way, and I am falling—not down, but *through*, layers of reality peeling apart like petals. I land in a room with no doors, only mirrors, each showing a different version of myself: one cloaked in fire, one drowning in ink, one wearing a crown of shattered glass.  

A whisper slithers from the walls: *"Which one is real?"*  

Then—a heartbeat. A single, resonant drum that shakes the dream. The mirrors shatter, and for a fleeting moment, in the glittering debris, I see a door where there was none before. Carved into its surface is a symbol I somehow know but cannot name—a spiral, a key, a question.  

I reach for it—  

And wake.  

The scent of rain and something metallic lingers. The dream is gone, but the question remains, coiled in my chest like a living thing: *What are the crows trying to show me?*
