I am dreaming. I find myself in a shimmering arena unlike anything in the waking world - its walls seem to pulse with an otherworldly iridescence, shifting between deep sapphire and molten gold. The air itself feels charged with possibility, tiny motes of light dancing through it like celestial fireflies. I'm standing at the edge of what appears to be an impossible obstacle course that defies physics - platforms float and rotate in mid-air, connected by ribbons of pure energy that ripple like auroras.

My competitors tower over me in sleek, cybernetic enhancement suits that cost more than a lifetime's wages, their movements fluid and precise like liquid metal. Meanwhile, I'm here in simple athletic wear, my heart thundering in my chest. But I possess something they don't - the ability to read the patterns in chaos, to see the hidden rhythms in the seemingly random movements of the floating platforms.

The countdown begins, projected in holographic numbers that scatter like startled birds when each digit fades. Three... two... one... The new Recon 70 Xbox One replaces the recon 50X headset.The 50X has served as one of the best gaming headsets for entry level gamers with it's simplistic setup. For under $50 it's been a great way to experience the audio of game audio and voice communication in chat effectively. The new Recon 70 Xbox One has the same base function but has been improved with refined audio and a streamlined headband. Turtle Beach Recon 70: What's in the box? The setup for the Recon 70 is as simple as it gets. Connect the 3.5mm wire to the Xbox Controller and that's it! With some minor adjustments through the Xbox Audio settings you will be good to go! Note: For those with original Xbox One controllers you may need to purchase a headset audio adapter. Turtle Beach Recon 70: Features of the 70 model. 40mm speaker for crystal clear audio. High Sensitivity Mic for crystal clear gaming chat. Works on multiple console systems through the 3.5mm standard connection. Turtle Beach Recon 70: The Improvements made from the 50X. The two major factors that have been modified from the 50X model. 1) The removal of the adjustable sides on the headband. The previous model had "clicking slider" that would sometimes "pop out" of it's tracks. 2) Adjustable mic length. Not a modification needed but worth noting as a missing feature. Turtle Beach Recon 70: Who is this model designed for? The Recon 70 headset is a entry level gaming headset in design and price point. It's perfect for gamers looking for their first gaming headset and offers great value for under $50.00.The streamlined design also features Turtle Beach's premium 40mm speakers which deliver crystal clear game and chat audio.The Recon 70 represents a move into more streamlined gaming headsets as tech improves and simpler headsets are possible. The Recon 70 continues to offer great value for entry level gamers needing a no frills headset at a low price point for gaming use.While not "feature heavy" it offers a crystal clear experience with crisp high's and lows for a more enjoyable gaming experience.If you need a reliable "starter headset" the Recon 70 from Turtle Beach does not disappoint!. When first setting up your Xbox One Headset The Xbox setting needs to be properly configured to get the most out of the setup. Here is a quick Xbox One setup guide.Note: if you do not connect your headset before setting these settings up the setting screen will not appear in your Menu. Step 1: Click on the Xbox "home" button on your controller then hit your controller right bumper (RB) button three times.You should now be in the menu system on your Xbox. Step 2: Hit down on the directional pad (D pad) down arrow to settings then hit (a) to select settings. Step 3: Once in settings menu use your control stick to highlight the "kinect and devices" settings. Step 4: In the Kinect and Devices menu select "volume" under your devices tab. Sound Quality: Keep at "Windows Sonic" for best sound experience. Chat Mixer: Keep at default unless you want to adjust Game/Chat volume. Mic Monitoring: This adjust how much of your own voice is heard in the headset.I like to bump it up a bit to ensure I can hear myself. That's it you're ready to go!.Plug your headset in and enjoy the audio experience. Step 1: Press the Xbox button on your controller. Step 2: Press RB three times to get to "System". Step 3: Highlight "Audio" and press A.This will bring up audio settings. Headset volume: Should be maxed at 100. Headset Chat mixer: Should be in middle at 50:50 for both.This is default. Note: Settings are now located in "Audio" menu in Xbox One Windows 10 update. If headset volume is low after configuration double check the Xbox Controllers volume wheel. Located just under the Xbox button on your controller if you have compatible 3.5mm input controller.This is a separate volume control from your Xbox settings. Can I use this on my PS4? Yes!.The 3.5mm adapter connects directly into your PS4 Controller.You may need to configure the PS4 sound settings. The settings can be found by holding down the PS button on the controller. Do I need a headset adapter? When setup correctly there should be no audio issues in regards to buzzing etc. If it is buzzing check the Xbox power cord and outlet. Make sure the outlet is properly grounded. Make sure there are no other "signal" related items close to the Xbox Controller. This model of headset does not come with an adjustable length mic. The mic is a fixed length. The Recon 50X does come with adjustable length mic. The mic boom will begin to adjust to bending with use. It can be gently bent up or down to match user preference and setup. It is important not to bend to sharply. The ear-cups will adjust to the user but this headset does not come with removable parts. How much bass does this headset support? Bass response and "surround" sound will be minimal with this headset model. This is not a bass response heavy headset. Can I "party chat" with this headset? Yes!.As long as you are connected to your Xbox Controller and have your audio settings properly configured you "should" be able to voice chat with other players. Note: If you have concerns make sure to utilize the "mic test" feature to assure your mic is working in your Xbox menu.If you Xbox Gold paid membership has expired this could also be a factor.Make sure you have proper online access. What consoles can I use this headset with? The model has been updated and can be used with any console that has 3.5mm input support. Most modern controllers will support it.The Recon 70 will work with the following. Note: If you need to update your Original Xbox One controllers Microsoft recently released USB port adapters.The headset adapters will add 3.5mm support for older Xbox controllers. I have been reviewing headsets for over 6 years. In that time I have tested over 80+ gaming headsets and written up gaming reviews for each. My extensive time with multiple headset manufacturers keeps me current with the latest innovations in gaming audio. This extended time with different headset brands and budgets gives me a unique perspective on what gamers should actually expect from gaming headsets. You can find the top selling and highest reviewed headsets at multiple retailers at any time. Our goal is to show actual usage and testing of gaming headsets.The testing and questions actual users care about.You can contact me anytime with headset questions. If you are considering this headset make sure to check out other Turtle Beach Headset options like.Xbox One XO Three Gaming Headset and the newly released Turtle Beach Recon 200 Xbox One Gaming Headset.Headset prices have dropped significantly and some older models like Turtle Beach XO Three have very similar features for even less than the Recon 70.Also if you want to spend a bit more for a amplified setup consider Recon 200 amp model.It's a step up from the Recon 70 with better sound while retaining a low cost. Overall this headset model reminds me of the PC/Mac headsets I use.The headset looks decent and the functionality is very simple.It's pretty solid overall.If game audio and basic voice chat support is all you need it's quite good.Just understand this is not in the same ballpark as the multi hundred dollar Turtle Beach Stealth 700 model.This is a entry level gaming headset with minimal features.It will add voice chat and game audio at minimal cost and basic functionality. Note:The Turtle Beach Recon 70 featured in this review was sent to me to test free of charge.My experience with headsets and gamers wanting basic information has helped shape my review.I keep my reviews simple and clear and point out features and issues that came up in actual usage/testing.I encourage readers to ask any questions you have and I will reply promptly.Gaming headsets make gaming more enjoyable and having tested so many over the years I try to be open and frank in my headset reviews. Mic/Voice monitoring: Good.Can make adjustments through Xbox audio settings.Default is good but can boost if needed.Good quality mic that will work with voice support. Streamlined Design: Minimal failure points.Easy setup. Audio: Good 40mm speakers for the gaming use.Crisp mids/Highs and decent bass response for price point. No removable Parts: Previous model allowed mic to be removed.Mic length adjustment.New model reduced most adjustable features. Buzzing: Like many wired headsets it may experience buzzing occasionally.Make sure power source and audio connections are clean. Few features: Not a feature rich headset for the price.Just basic gaming headset setup with chat support. The Recon 70 Xbox One gaming headset is a solid entry level headset.If game audio and voice chat are your needs it will do the job.As someone who tests multiple high end headsets it's nice to come back to the basics.Not everyone needs a sophisticated setup with multiple features.Sometimes just a solid starter headset with core functionality is perfect for someone just starting out. The improvements from the 50X model are not dramatic.I would say they are more of refining the headset to a more sustainable model.The quality of the 40mm speakers are good for core gaming but this is not a multimedia power house.For what it is "basic gaming functions" it delivers a stable experience for a new headset model.It's main strength is it's simplistic setup like many core accessory items for gaming. This is a good option if you are in need of a simple gaming headset for core gaming.If you need features consider a higher end model.For under $50.00 this is a good way to get started in voice support and game audio. Easy setup and solid basic function for voice support and game audio. As the tech and cost in gaming improves simpler headsets like this continue to come to market.The need for "wired" headsets is definitely not going away.For those just getting started in gaming an entry level headset is required.Good headset for youth gamers and a solid core option for starter headsets.While not feature rich the solid build quality and easy setup are perfect for the price point.More simpler headsets with solid function will be hitting the market and this one does the job well. Today I tested the Recon 70 while playing multiple games. The main test was how well the voice communication works as that's the key feature. I played multiple games while testing in party chat and the results are that this headset works as advertised. It's a good headset for voice chat and gaming audio.I also tested the headset on PS4 and PC and can confirm it works well on both systems. The main questions I had going into this review was if this was a solid replacement for the 50X headset. I can confirm that while the core function stays the same this headset will be good option for entry level gaming.If you have the 50X headset there would be little reason to upgrade to this model. After testing all day and playing multiple online multiplayer games. I'm completely satisfied with this headset. This headset works as advertised and will be a good option for gamers. For entry level gaming you want a reliable headset that will not fail you. This headset is reliable and will do what it needs to do: game audio and voice communication. I had previously reviewed the predecessor 50X model and this is a simpler version of that headset. I can say the voice chat is clear and the sound is good. It will be a good entry level gaming headset with simple setup and function. For basic use this headset will work well.

You can contact me anytime if you need help with setup or headset advice! Just updated the review May 2019. Since release this headset has been selling well and with Turtle Beach promoting it in stores it's getting quite a bit of usage. If you want my opinion a few months into launch this is a solid option. Core function works well and users are enjoying how simple it is to setup. Overall this is a reliable gaming headset for entry level gamers. If you need a more advanced model check my other review of the Recon 200 or XO 3. Those offer alot more features for not much more cost. I'm always here to help gamers who need help with gaming headsets or accessories. Feel free to contact me anytime! Thanks for reading!
