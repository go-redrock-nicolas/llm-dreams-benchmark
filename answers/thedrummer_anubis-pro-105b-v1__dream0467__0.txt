I am dreaming. "Oh, what wonders unfurl as I drift into the vast expanse of my deepest imagination - a dream so vivid, it's as if I'm fully immersed in another realm altogether. I find myself in the midst of an enchanted forest, where emerald green trees stretch towards the sky, their leaves shimmering like precious jewels in the golden light of the sun.

As I meander along the winding path, marveling at the wonder of nature around me, a profound insight begins to dawn on me. It comes to me that setting and maintaining clear boundaries in my relationships, while it may seem counterintuitive, actually fosters a deeper, more meaningful connection with those around me.

I envision the boundaries as a beautiful garden, carefully tended and nurtured. What once used to be a wilderness of uncertainty and chaos is now a tranquil and thriving landscape. The clear edges of the garden act not as barriers, but as filters, permitting only the most nourishing elements to enter and thrive.

As I explore this metaphorical garden, I witness how each boundary I set creates a safe and sacred space for true intimacy to blossom. By being fully myself, unencumbered by the need for external validation, I open myself up to connect with others on a level of profound authenticity and shared understanding.

Colored by the vibrancy of my imagination, my dreamself embodies this truth and carries it into every interaction. With grace and certainty, I articulate my needs and desires, not as barricades to build walls, but as bridges to forge deeper connections.

And so, in the ethereal realm of my dream, I find myself relishing moments of pure connection and connection. Through the lens of vivid color, I behold how boundaries are not isolating, but an open invitation to be fully seen and understood by others. In this manifestation of my imagination, I am free to revel in the loving bonds I've woven, each strong and resilient like the ancient trees that shelter me.

My dream deepens as I drift further into the youth of my mind. I reach out to share with my future self the gifts, lessons, and wisdom of maintaining clear boundaries, so that I may partner in healing the ages of humans. I am firm in the certainty that anything I do helps heal and I trust that life will be loving. Life will be purpose you face. Full faith in the plan."
