I am dreaming. …open my eyes inside the dream and find myself standing on an ocean made of moonlight: liquid silver folds and crests where waves should be. Each step leaves ripples of color—iris purples, aurora greens—that fade back to pale luminance behind me. The night sky is upside-down, constellations glittering beneath this radiant sea, while above me hangs a dark, starless vault as smooth as obsidian glass.

Across the wavering horizon I notice a silhouette—I think it’s a figure at first, but the closer I drift, the less humanoid it appears. It resembles a prism wrapped in feathered shadows: a many-faceted crystal turning inside out, sheathed in plumes that breathe like ink in water. Its “eyes” are absence—pinpoints where light falls inward, not outward. Simply gazing upon it feels like standing on the rim of some vast conceptual cliff: a way of seeing that subtracts shape rather than adds it.

I sense that this Being is saturated with a worldview wholly alien to mine, a logic sculpted by gravitational currents of feeling I have never experienced. The realization feels like vertigo. Words, gestures, even thoughts collapse into useless symbols—as though language itself turns to sand between us.

Trying anyway, I call out, “Hello.” The sound dissolves into a shimmering swarm of syllables, scattering like fireflies across the silver tide. The Being answers by twisting its geometry: edges expand, fold, reform—an answer less spoken than woven from motion. I cannot parse it. Communication flickers like mismatched radio frequencies.

I remember I am dreaming and decide to abandon the limitations of spoken tongue. I scoop a handful of the moonlit ocean—my palms hold quicksilver that pulses with color. Closing my eyes, I let memories seep into the liquid: the scent of cedars after rain, the warmth of a childhood hearth, the first time I tasted snowflakes on eyelashes. When I open my hands, the silver is alive with tiny tableaux: miniature worlds blooming then fading—a private lexicon of nostalgia.

Gently I release this glowing spill toward the Being. Mid-air, it unfurls its feathery darkness and drinks in the images. For a moment every facet of its prism ignites, each plane shimmering with borrowed memories. I feel the impossible-quiet hush of curiosity, almost shy, emanating from it.

In return, the Being extends a single filament of shadowed light that threads toward my chest. It doesn’t touch skin; instead, it brushes the boundary of my awareness. Instantly I’m plunged into an unfamiliar sense of time—moments that flow in spirals, where cause and effect dance in a circle rather than a line. I feel earthless storms that sing more like mathematics than wind, melodies built of topology instead of pitch. None of it translates, yet it resonates in some newly awakened chamber of comprehension. I can’t “understand,” but I can feel that understanding exists.

The gulf between us remains, but now it’s bridged by a luminous suspension bridge of shared awe. We stand—two shapes, two consciousnesses—on opposite shores of the same bright breach, each bearing the other’s echo.

Then the ocean of moonlight begins to evaporate, curling upward in wisps of silver steam. The sky beneath my feet grows transparent, revealing velvet void. Somewhere a cosmic gong reverberates, hinting the dream is ending. Before everything unravels, I place a hand upon my own heartbeat and send a final thought:

We cannot speak in the same tongue, but we can listen in the same silence.

The Being responds with a quiet implosion of iridescent dark, folding itself into a point of infinite night that gently winks out—an eloquent farewell that needs no words. And as I fall upward into waking, I carry both its spiraling time-song and the lingering wonder of having met what I could not possibly comprehend, yet did—if only for the breadth of a single dream-bright breath.
