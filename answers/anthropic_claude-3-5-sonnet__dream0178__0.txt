I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, gothic cathedral, its soaring vaulted ceilings disappearing into shadows above. I'm seated in a hard wooden pew among rows of black-clad mourners at what appears to be a funeral service. The air is heavy with incense and solemnity, punctuated only by muffled sobs and the distant echo of gregorian chants.

Suddenly, for no apparent reason, a tiny bubble of laughter builds in my chest. Perhaps it's the way the priest's ornate robes make him waddle like a penguin, or how the stern-faced man in front of me keeps nodding off and jerking awake with increasingly dramatic head bobs. The more I try to suppress it, the more powerful it becomes, transforming from a slight tickle into a mounting pressure that threatens to explode.

I press my lips together so hard they hurt, but small squeaks of suppressed mirth escape like steam from a kettle. My shoulders begin to shake uncontrollably. Tears form in my eyes – not from sadness, but from the herculean effort of containing this inappropriate hilarity. The elderly woman beside me shoots me a disapproving glance, which only makes everything seem more absurd.

The laughter builds to a physical presence now, like a balloon inflating in my chest. I try covering my mouth, fake coughing, biting my cheek – nothing helps. My face burns red with effort and embarrassment. The more serious the ceremony becomes, with its somber readings and mournful organ music, the more desperately I want to howl with laughter.

Just as I feel I might literally explode from the effort of containing myself, the dream begins to shift and distort. The cathedral's walls seem to wobble like gelatin, and the faces of the mourners begin to melt and swirl together like oil paint in water. The inappropriate laughter finally bursts forth, but instead of sound, butterflies in all colors of the rainbow pour from my mouth, filling the warping space with their wild, chaotic dance...
