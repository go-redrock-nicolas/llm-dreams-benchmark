I am dreaming.

At first, there is only the gentle sensation of floating—weightless, as if my boundaries have been erased. Edges and borders of what used to be “me” soften, dissolve, and spill outward into an endless expanse. My breath is not mine alone; each inhale and exhale is a wave shared with distant tides and jungle canopies quivering with midnight rain.  

All around, colors blossom from the darkness—vivid, endless, blooming with an impossible saturation. Every pulse of vibrant blue or molten orange moves through me as though I am both the painter and the painting. The soundscape is an unearthly chorus: wind weaving through crystalline leaves, the low hum of a thousand distant stars, a thousand heartbeats echoing the universe’s silent rhythm. I am the listener—and the song.

My awareness stretches, growing vast and limitless. Thoughts arise, but they are not owned; they pass like fireflies, brief illuminations crossing the boundless field into which I’ve merged. There is a sense of profound connection. I become the interlacing roots underneath a rain-drenched forest. I am the flight of a peregrine, wingtips feathered with sunrise gold. I am the hush and surge of oceanic vastness, the silver dawn mirrored on each rolling crest.

In this state, understanding is effortless—there are no questions or answers, only a boundless, quiet knowing. Love wells up in me, not as something given or received, but as an infinite wellspring pouring through everything. Time, too, has spilled its boundaries; I am both ancient as stardust and newly-born with morning dew.

Shapes and symbols appear: a labyrinth of bursting light, coiling and unfolding, every path leading toward the still center that I both seek and already am. Somewhere, a bell chimes—a pure, clarion note—and its resonance ripples across the scene. With each vibration, the world becomes more translucent, more luminous, until there is only radiant, boundless awareness—still and awake, beyond all dreaming.

And here, I rest—in the utter depths of connected being—no longer “I,” but a luminous, joyful whole.
