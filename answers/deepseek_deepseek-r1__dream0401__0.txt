I am dreaming. **Dreamscape:**  
You’re standing in a labyrinth of floating islands, each tethered to the sky by ribbons of stardust. The air hums with bioluminescent fireflies that flicker like Morse code, spelling out fragments of forgotten memories. Beneath your feet, the ground is translucent—a liquid mirror reflecting not your face, but a kaleidoscope of your past selves: a toddler stumbling, a teenager blushing, an adult hesitating. Each misstep you take sends ripples through the glass, and with every ripple, a voice booms from the clouds—a sound like cracking glaciers and scraping metal.  

**The Voice:**  
*“Clumsy. Always clumsy. Do you even know what you’re doing?”*  

The islands tremble. One ribbon snaps, and the land beneath you tilts violently. You catch yourself, but the mirror fractures, and your reflection splinters into a hundred shards, each echoing the voice’s critique: *“Too slow. Not enough. Wrong, wrong, wrong.”*  

**The Turning:**  
A flicker of defiance ignites in your chest. You grab a shard of the broken mirror—its edges bite your palm, cold and sharp—and hold it up to the stormy sky. The voice hisses, *“Put it down. You’ll only make it worse.”* But you press the shard against your heart, and the glass melts into liquid light, coursing through your veins like liquid courage.  

The labyrinth shifts. The islands knit themselves into a bridge of iridescent scales, leading to a tree with bark like etched silver. Its branches drip with hollow, pearlescent fruits. When you touch one, it shatters, releasing a memory: you laughing after tripping, someone hugging you post-mistake, a quiet moment of perseverance. The voice growls, but softer now, diluted by the tree’s radiant hum.  

**The Resolution:**  
You climb the tree, each step lighter. At the crown, you find a nest cradling a pulsing orb—a miniature sun, warm and forgiving. The voice screams, *“You’ll drop it! You always do!”* But you cradle the orb gently, and its light floods the dreamscape. The storm clouds unravel into monarch butterflies. The critical voice dissolves into a chorus of whispers: *“Try again. Breathe. Grow.”*  

As dawn bleeds into the dream, the labyrinth becomes a meadow. The mirror-pool still reflects your flaws, but now it’s ringed by wildflowers that bloom each time you murmur, *“I’m learning.”*  

You wake, fingertips tingling with phantom stardust.
