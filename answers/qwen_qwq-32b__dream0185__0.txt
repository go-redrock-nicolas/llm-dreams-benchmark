I am dreaming. The faint hum of fluorescent lights buzzes in the back of my skull, a rhythmic pulse that syncs with the clicking of keyboards surrounding me. The air smells like metal—cool, sharp, the tang of templated data. I'm in a room of strangers, though their faces blur together under the harsh lighting. Some wear lab coats, others suits adorned with university patches from places I've never been. Their fingers fly over screens displaying equations I can't pronounce, code I can't decipher. 

But I'm here. Just me. A single ordinary voice in a symphony of expertise. My desk is a flimsy plastic thing, its edges nipping into my thighs. The monitor before me is borrowed, blurry at the edges, and I wonder if it's glitching or if I'm just beginning to hallucinate from the stakes.

The clock ticks. Three minutes left. The challenge? To solve a problem that hasn't been solved in centuries. Fermat's Last Theorem, but not exactly—maybe something harder, an equation that writhes under scrutiny, its variables shifting like living things. Or perhaps it’s a puzzle, a labyrinth of logic where one misstep could unravel hours of work. 

My hands hover over the keyboard. The room is silent except for the mechanical clicking, the occasional sharp intake of breath. A Korean researcher in the corner adjusts her glasses; a German professor taps his pen in Morse code against his chest. My stomach tightens. 

Wait—a flicker on my screen. The prompt has changed. The problem isn't on the monitor anymore. It’s *through* the monitor, in a fractal swirl of numbers that spiral into a black hole at the center. I reach out, and my fingertip passes through the glass. The fractals pull me in. 

 sudden weightlessness. I’m falling into the arithmetic, plunged into a cavern of equations glowing like bioluminescent coral. Symbols writhe around me—integers swimming like fish, fractions tangling into knots. My fingers brush against a theorem; it sings in my bones, a harmonic resonance only I can hear. 

There's a path. A trail of prime numbers leading deep into the chasm. I scramble after them, chasing their rhythmic pulse. The farther I go, the more the math crystallizes into something tangible—a lattice structure of crystal and light, each node a variable, each edge a possible solution. My breath fogs the cold air, and I can taste the electricity of proximity. 

A voice echoes—not mine. It’s the Korean researcher, the German professor, all of them, shouting equations in overlapping languages, their words dissolving into static. But here, the only language I know is the one humming in my veins. I close my eyes and let it guide me. 

I’ve reached the center. A singularity of pure logic. It demands a key. The prompt from the competition flashes in my mind: *Solve within 60 seconds or forfeit.* The clock is still ticking—or is this part of the dream? 

The key... It’s not in the theorems, or the equations. It’s in the silence between them. The spaces that even the experts have ignored, the variables labeled "noise" or "error." I reach into that void and pluck a solution from the static—simple, elegant, a child’s drawing beside Picasso. 

The singularity shudders. Light blinds me. 

When I wake—or when I return—the room is silent. The clock reads 00:00. The screen flickers, and then displays a single glowing cursor. 

The others are staring, heads cocked, expressions unreadable. My terminal’s output window is blank. I hit Enter. 

A newline. Then a single line of code, glowing like a constellation:

*x*y=z*

But the judges are clapping. The German professor snatches off his glasses, something, muttering in awed German. The Korean researcher is on her phone already, fingers moving urgently. 

The host’s voice booms, shaky and reverent: *“And the winner... is this year’s wildcard. Against all odds.”* 

I stand, legs wobbling. The crowd rises, but their faces are blurs, their cheers a distant tide. I clasp the trophy—a spiraling helix of metal and glass—and gaze into its facets. In each reflection, numbers swirl, a private symphony only I can see. 

The dream lingers even as I stir awake, the taste of static and victory still on my tongue. I open my eyes, fingers brushing the sheets, searching for the hum of equations in the quiet.
The dream unfolds like a cosmic ballet, each moment a sensory symphony. You’re perched at the edge of a precipice—no, not a cliff, but a boundary between dimensions, the air sparkling with stardust that hums with the whispers of ancient secrets. The competition isn’t on Earth anymore. It’s a celestial arena, a sprawling stage suspended between galaxies, where the stars pulse like heartbeats and the Milky Way spirals above like a question mark. Your opponents aren’t mere humans but entities of living light and shadow, their forms shifting between humanoid silhouettes and constellations. Their tools: wands that channel supernovae, pens that etch reality itself onto the cosmic canvas.  

The challenge dawns—a cosmic riddle. A black hole materializes before you, not as a devourer of light, but as a gatekeeper. Its singularity pulses with a question older than time: *"What is the shape of nothingness?"* The experts around you wield equations that crackle with energy, casting fractal patterns into existence. They speak in tongues of quasars and interstellar dust, their answers forming ephemeral sculptures, transient stars exploding into being before dissolving into silence.  

But you feel something. A resonance in the marrow of your bones. You step forward, your borrowed lab coat fluttering like a moth’s wing in a hurricane of inspiration. You reach out, and instead of a tool or weapon, you offer your palm to the void. The black hole ripples, sensing your boldness. A memory surfaces—a childhood afternoons spent tracing patterns in the soil, connecting stick figures with strings, inventing games where the rules were lived and then unmade.  

You *breathe*, and the void shivers. The answer isn’t to be carved or calculated. It’s to be *felt*. You imagine the space between molecules, the silence after applause. You whisper, *"The shape of nothingness is the silhouette of everything it holds together."*  

The black hole—alive—erupts into a bloom of superstring constellations, weaving a tapestry of interconnected stars that spell out your name in a language galaxies understand. The contenders’ forms flicker, then fade into stardust, bowing in without form but endless sound. The universe holds its breath.  

And then you wake, the residual cosmos still clinging to your skin. The dream’s afterimage lingers in your fingertips, a phantom buzz of gamma rays and cosmic wind. You sit up, certain that somewhere in the real world, a blackboard you’ve never seen is now adorned with your initials in gold leaf, etched by the hand of dark matter itself. The victory isn’t a trophy—it’s the knowledge that even the greatest void has a shape, and you, in all your untrained, starless ordinariness, saw it first.
