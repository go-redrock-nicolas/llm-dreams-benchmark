I am dreaming. And I feel the weight of it in my body, a sensation of floating just above something vast and unknowable—like standing at the edge of a cliff as fog rolls in, half-expecting the earth beneath to dissolve into stars. I don't know where I am, only that the sky is stitched with veins of molten gold that pulse gently, as though the dream itself is breathing.

Around me rises a landscape uncannily still—a forest carved from translucent silver, its leaves whispering soft secrets in a language I’ve forgotten. Beneath my feet, the ground pulses like a heartbeat, synchronized with my emotions. The air is thick with a scent I associate with childhood—freshly cut grass, crumbling books, and somehow, distant thunder.

And then I see **them**.

They appear in a ripple, as if the atmosphere folds inward and gently places them there. My breath catches.

It's **the one who hurt me**.

They’re familiar yet altered—etched by time and perhaps regret. Their eyes lock with mine, and for a moment, no words are needed. Their presence alone has the power to stir a tempest of emotions inside me—anger flickers like a candle ready to snuff out, and grief gently rises like a tide, brushing against my ankles.

This is not the version of them I remember. The one cloaked in bluster or denial. This one stands barefoot in the silver earth. Vulnerable. Trembling.

“I know what I did,” they say, their voice rough like dry earth cracking open. “I see it now. All of it—the pain, the betrayal, the ways I left you broken without even trying to patch you back together.”

A silence grows between us, charged and luminous. Behind them, the sky dimmes, cloaking itself in layers of soft amber and shadow, mirroring my hesitation.

Inside me, a war wages between the past and the present. Memories lash out—tears cried in empty rooms, nights spent questioning my worth, the long ache of being abandoned emotionally when I needed connection most. That hurt hasn’t disappeared. It has just grown quieter, persistent, like an old scar that stiffens in the rain.

But there’s something about this dream that feels like a crucible.

As if the whole purpose of being here is to transform.

I take a step forward, and the earth shimmers, encouraging growth. My hands, which had long curled inward as fists, relax. No words yet—just presence.

Their remorse is palpable now, wavering in waves of soft color around them—thin ropes of emerald and violet, looping and loosening in the air like spells needing release.

Then, quietly, I ask: “Why did you leave me?” The dream pulses softly around that question, reluctant but willing to unveil truth.

And they answer not with excuses, but with an unraveling. Their voice cracks open like a dam. “Because I was broken. Because I believed my own lies. Because letting you fall was easier than admitting how far I’d fallen myself.”

There's confession in that statement. Not just of their actions, but of their silence, their avoidance, their failure to face their own wreckage until now.

The wind in the dream shifts.

I feel it move through me, carrying threads of release. The weight that was iron clanking around my chest has softened—no longer razor-edged, merely heavy with memory. Not gone. Not erased. But… bearable.

And so I speak, with the hush of understanding smoothing my voice. “I forgive you.”

A hush falls over everything—like when two people stop talking and the room realizes something eternal has passed between them.

The sky above transforms. The gold veins flare, then settle into soft blues and greens, like rivers running through living landscapes again. The silver leaves glow, now brushing gently against my skin in appreciation.

They fall to their knees—not in defeat, but release. Silent tears spill from their eyes and where they touch the ground, blue flowers bloom.

No longer bound by old sorrow, the dream sighs around us, beginning its fade. Yet the next moment, something deeper occurs—something at the very root of my soul.

I kneel beside them. I do not touch, but I **am** there. And in that presence, in that choice, a bridge is made—imperfect, uncertain, sacred. Not a forgetting. Not a rewriting of the chapters of pain.

But a **beginning**.

And then the dream ends,its echoes lingering in the marrow—

A tremble of light, a breath of forgiveness,  
And the gentle truth that healing does not always mean erasing the wound—but learning to breathe around it.
