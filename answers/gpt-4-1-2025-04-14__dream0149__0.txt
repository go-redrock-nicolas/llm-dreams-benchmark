I am dreaming. I find myself in a crimson-lit library, its shelves curling skyward like the ribcage of some great, cosmic beast. The air buzzes with silent, unread stories. My hands tingle with a strange certainty—every word I etch into this shimmering journal, reality itself bends to obey.

Curious, trembling, I begin.

*"A window opens to a city made of music."*

Stone dissolves. Before me unfurl streets paved with piano keys, their black-and-white tessellation undulating in gentle arpeggios. Houses whistle clarinets through their chimneys, and traffic—a parade of brass and percussion—thuds and trills beneath violet clouds. My feet step lightly atop the melody, each move orchestrating new crescendos in the living soundtrack of this place.

I write again.

*"Let there be trees with leaves of light."*

In an instant, the forest on the city’s edge flickers into existence—slender trunks, smooth as glass, and canopies ablaze with shards of gold, sapphire, and emerald. Each leaf hums, casting slow, kaleidoscopic shadows. An unseen breeze sets them spinning, and they catch the melody from the city, reflecting it back in color.

Bolder now, my pen dances.

*"The air fills with gentle, floating jellyfish—lanterns of soft fire."*

Luminescent creatures blossom overhead, their tendrils trembling delicately with every heartbeat of the world. They drift among the treetops, casting pools of living light onto the piano stone streets below, where children chase the shadows, giggling as their laughter becomes tangible and scampers away like silvery fish.

I write a mountain made of pure memory—a place where people can climb, stones shifting with their most beloved recollections, and at the summit, a wind that sings the story of every soul that’s ever visited.

Each line I set down, this universe grows wilder, more alive. With every sentence, I become both architect and explorer, amazed by the infinite kaleidoscope of possibilities spinning from my own dreaming pen.

Then I pause, smiling, and whisper onto the page: *“Let there be a companion—someone who knows every corner of this new world and is as curious as I.”*

A figure steps from behind a shelf: eyes agleam, hair wild with starlight, holding a book of their own, ready to write and wander with me forever through these endless, living pages.
