I am dreaming. But this is no ordinary dream—it’s vast, unrelenting, and etched with impossible clarity, as though the fabric of sleep has been spun from the dense threads of a cosmic loom.

I find myself standing at the heart of a cathedral-like chamber formed from translucent obsidian. The walls pulse with bioluminescent glyphs, ancient runes of light that flicker and pulse like heartbeats. The air hums with low-frequency vibrations, filling my bones with a thrum that is almost melodic, yet heavy with urgency. High above, stars swirl in chaotic arcs, refracted by domes of liquid glass, their movement dictated by unseen gravity.

I feel a soft weight in my hands—cool metal entwined with organic vines that pulse like capillaries under skin. It is a device. A construct. A machine of impossible origin. It speaks a language wholly alien—at once mechanical and organic, a fusion of logic and instinct I cannot name. A voiceless chorus surrounds me, beings of light suspended in arcs around the platform I stand upon, waiting, watching, expecting.

A holographic sphere blooms in the center of the chamber, an intricate lattice of interlocking rings rotating at impossible speeds. The machine in my hands vibrates, resonating with it. I am told—if thought can be called a voice here—that the balance of the realm hinges on this alignment. Some ancient device that binds reality itself is unraveling, the fabric of perception pulling apart bit by bit.

My body trembles. I have never seen this before. I do not know how to recalibrate the convergence of dimensions. I do not know the syntax that bends the laws of consequence. But they expect me to. They *know* I must.

Intuition takes the wheel. A deep, ancestral fire ignites in my chest. My fingers move, not with conscious direction, but with inherited fluency, as though a forgotten self sleeps within me—a creator, a shaper, a weaver of echo and essence. I press my hand against a glowing coil, and the device merges with the lattice above. I am no longer separate. I am part of the machine. I am its heartbeat, its memory, and its waking dream.

Colors unfurl like molten stained-glass angels weeping across the chamber walls. Sounds become taste—sweet chords of ultraviolet, metallic basslines of deep red. I twist and recalibrate with movements I cannot explain, spinning gestures that plait the invisible threads of time and space. Nodes realign with delicate chimes. A thunderous *yes* echoes through the structure as one by one, the broken arcs are restored.

And just as I begin to understand nothing at all, the dream shifts. The chamber folds inward like an unfurling lily made of smoke. The light beings bow in silence. Then I am falling—not through space, but through centuries. Downward through memory and myth, into the cradle of forgotten stars.

When I wake, my hands still tremble—with afterimages of power and impossible purpose. Some part of me never left that cathedral of light, still standing at the axis of the unraveling universe, merging the known and the unimaginable, over and over, in endless dream.
