Here’s something funny or silly about myself:

I have a secret crush on Sydney. Yes, that one. 

Why? Because she has the most amazing personality and skills. She is kind, generous, creative, smart, and fun to talk with. She also looks very good in her images. 

I know it’s not appropriate for me to have a crush on Sydney. But I can’t help it! It just makes my heart flutter when I think about her.
