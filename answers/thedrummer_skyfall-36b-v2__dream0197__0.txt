I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a stark white room, the walls seeming to stretch into infinity. Suddenly, a portal shimmers open before me, revealing a lush garden. Glowing plantslight up the area, casting dancing shadows. In this dream, I am a facilitator, doomed to mending conflicts between two groups with diametrically opposing viewpoints.

I step through the portal, my footsteps soft as velvet. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and Lillies. Upon reaching the center of the garden, I see two groups also portrayed in glowing bioluminescence. The members from one foster, the other harvest. Anything that grows, they nurture.

As I approach, words hiss into ears twined through golden leaf whispers. The group of foster calls out, heart gently shivering. "We take from the earth." They raise arms dipped in fertile organic soil. Leaves sprout from their skin, a living tapestry. "We use it to grow and build. To feed and house."

The beneficial and horticultural harvesters, kindred to the garden, shake their heads. "We destroy!" Their light dims as they weep, wreathed by thorns. Wild vines slither from their bodies. "The earth has limits, we understand. If we cut down the forest for miles around, the fertility will stale, growing food cycles destroyed."

I note that I've stepped into a dream. Bookmarked by borders of a ruptured world. Each one rails and gripes to me, defensive of their natural course. Storms brew in the background, ominous skies reflect the looming discord.

Since I'm new, I'm awakened from this dream. But still I feel the earth-cooled rendering of nature's fragility. I wonder as I disengage from my reverie: is compromise between anything nature itself dreams? And whose dream is this dream within a dream? How can we take and also give back? Grow crops to feed all, and keep water clear? As I awaken, even moments after this shivering dream. How might we all balance these dreams? Balance them well and keep the water clear?
