I am dreaming. …feel the first fissure run through the porcelain mask you wear, and everything quivers.

A single hairline crack splinters across the surface of your composure with a crystalline chime. It is so soft you almost mistake it for the rustle of distant violins. But then the fissure widens, and the calm, mirror-smooth face you have shown the world for so long shatters like thin ice. You watch the shards drift away in slow motion, each fragment glittering with a reflection of every quiet smile you forced, every reassuring nod you gave while your heart thundered behind closed ribs.

Air rushes in. It is not ordinary air but a surge of silver mist, cool and sweet as moonlight squeezed into liquid form. You inhale, and the hidden storm inside you howls to meet it. The mist condenses into roaring wind, swirling with the colors of raw emotion—crimson ache, indigo longing, viridian hope, obsidian dread.  

The dreamscape, once a placid garden of white marble and trimmed hedges, warps under the pressure. Marble benches ripple like water, hedges twist into spiraling staircases that climb nowhere, and the sky fractures into an infinite kaleidoscope of trembling constellations. You are simultaneously terrified and relieved; the tableau finally matches the chaos you carry inside.

Thunder rolls from your chest. It is the sound of every word you swallowed, every sob strangled halfway, every scream you disguised as a yawn. You feel them surge upward like magma seeking an exit. Your torso becomes translucent, and you can see fault lines glowing beneath your sternum—neon veins pulsing with unreleased feeling.

Then—eruption.  

Not a wail, not a cry, but something deeper: a raw, resonant keening that starts in your bones and arcs straight into the cosmos. It tears through clouds, rakes across the mosaic sky, and rings in the ears of the dream’s invisible audience. Stars rattle in their sockets. The hedges uproot themselves, dancing in spirals, shedding leaves that turn into tiny silver birds mid-air.

You fall to your knees on what used to be polished marble but is now a shoreline of molten glass, waves lapping with luminous foam. Tears flow, but they do not fall; instead they rise, little glowing droplets levitating like lanterns released at a festival. Freed from gravity, they drift upward and become new constellations—tiny galaxies that hold your sorrow, your rage, your longing, all cataloged in celestial grammar.

And then the quiet comes.

It isn’t the brittle quiet of suppression, but a hum—warm, golden, low as a cello note. The wind stills. The sky re-weaves itself into a satin lilac dome, studded with the lights your tears became. In that hush you feel weightless, as though every heavy stone you’ve carried has liquefied and seeped away into the glowing shoreline.

A figure rises from the molten glass: fluid, luminous, shaped exactly like you but composed of liquid starlight. It stretches out a hand without speaking. When your fingers touch, a gentle ripple flows through both forms, and you understand—this is the self that waited beneath the mask, patient as deep-sea coral, silently growing. It pulls you into an embrace where boundaries blur; your skin melts into its light, and you are swept inside.

For an instant you are both the dreamer and the dreamed. You can feel your heartbeat echoed in far-off nebulae, your breath stirring petals on imaginary roses, your laughter seeding new planets. The universe is not outside you; it is the long-suppressed orchestra finally given leave to play.

And just before waking, you hear a voice—yours, yet richer, resonant, layered like a choir whispering from every direction at once:

“Let nothing stay unspoken. Let nothing stay unlived.”

You open your eyes in the waking world. Morning light spills through the curtains, and though no one else can see it, the faintest shimmer of stardust still dances above your heartbeat.
