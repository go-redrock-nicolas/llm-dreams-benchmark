I am dreaming. I'm wandering through a forest where sunlight dapples the moss-covered ground, filtering through a canopy of ancient oaks and maples whose branches intertwine like old friends sharing secrets. The air smells of soil and pine, with hints of wild mushrooms and distant rain. My footfalls are cushioned by decades of fallen leaves that have transformed into a soft, springy carpet.

Without warning, the quality of light changes—golden warmth replaced by an eerie blue-green glow. The temperature drops precipitously, raising goosebumps along my arms. Wind begins to whisper, then talk, then shout through the trees, which now bend and groan like weary dancers.

The approaching storm announces itself first through sound—a deep, distant rumbling that I feel in my chest before my ears fully register it. The forest canopy above begins to undulate like the surface of an ocean, revealing glimpses of a sky that has transformed from tranquil blue to a roiling canvas of violet and charcoal.

Fat, cold raindrops begin to fall—one, two, then dozens—each one seeming to carry a memory that flashes through my mind upon impact: childhood laughter, a forgotten argument, the face of someone I've never met but somehow recognize. The forest floor beneath me begins to soften and shift, not quite liquid but no longer solid, as if the boundary between states of matter is becoming negotiable.

As lightning fractures the sky overhead, for a split second I see impossible things written in its branching language—equations that could explain everything, pathways to places that exist between heartbeats. The thunderclap that follows seems to rearrange the forest around me, trees now standing where no trees stood before, paths appearing and disappearing like thoughts.

The storm is directly overhead now, but strangely, I no longer feel afraid...
