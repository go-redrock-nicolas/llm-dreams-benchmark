I am dreaming. 

You’re traveling in a foreign country when suddenly political unrest erupts and borders close. With uncertainty everywhere and your anxiety rising, you decide to flee before it’s too late. You hop on the first boat out of there with other panicked people who are desperate for freedom. 

As you sail away from the city that was once your home, the beauty around you is breathtaking: white sandy beaches, crystal blue waters, and lush green mountains. You feel a sense of relief mixed with excitement as you discover new places to explore and experience new things for yourself. 

But then you see something that makes your heart drop: a massive army is chasing after the boat! They’re armed with advanced weapons and their determination is unwavering. They won’t stop until they capture or kill everyone on board! 

What do you do? What would be your response to this situation? How can you protect yourself and others? Share your thoughts with me, and let’s see what happens next in this dream world together!
