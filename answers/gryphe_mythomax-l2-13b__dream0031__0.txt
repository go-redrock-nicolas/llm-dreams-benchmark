I am dreaming. The air is electric with fear and confusion as the subway car plunges into darkness. My heart races and my breathing quickens as I grip onto the metal bar above me, trying to steady myself against the sudden jerk of the train coming to a stop. The only light filtering in is a faint emergency exit sign, its weak glow barely penetrating the thick blackness that envelops us.

In the distance, I hear muffled voices calling out for help, lost in the chaos. Nearby, someone begins to cry uncontrollably, their sobs echoing through the car like an eerie lullaby. I close my eyes and take a deep breath, trying to steady myself and ignore the rising tide of hysteria around me.

Suddenly, the train jerks forward again, throwing passengers off balance and causing a few to cry out in surprise. The lights flicker back on, casting grotesque shadows against the walls of the car. Dread fills my stomach as I realize we're not at any station - weâ€™re stuck somewhere deep underground, cut off from the outside world.

A chill runs up my spine as I notice the digital display above the doors now reads "Abandoned Tunnel 23." My heart sinks into my stomach as realization sets in - we're stranded in a forgotten, forgotten corner of the labyrinthine subway system, with no way out and no idea what horrors might lurk in the darkness around us.

Panic takes hold of me like a vice, trapping me in a paralyzing fear. I can feel hot, sticky tears prick at the corners of my eyes as I cling to the hope that somehow, someway, we'll find a way out of this nightmare before it's too late.
