I am dreaming. {{From A to B movement}}

---

In this shimmering dreamscape, I find myself walking down an endless corridor lined with floor-to-ceiling mirrors that ripple like liquid mercury. Each reflection I pass reveals not my own face, but the faces of people I know—colleagues, friends, even strangers met in passing. Their expressions flicker between judgment and vulnerability, their eyes following me with silent accusation.

The hallway breathes around me, its walls pulsing like living tissue, and with each step, the air grows thicker with the scent of old books and rain-soaked earth. Suddenly, one mirror shimmers differently than the rest. In it, I see myself, but distorted—my features morphing into those I'd just judged: the impatient coworker, the overly critical friend, the indecisive stranger. My stomach lurches as I realize their flaws are mine, magnified and staring back at me.

A whispering chorus fills the air, voices overlapping like waves: "You see the speck in their eye, but not the log in your own..." The words vibrate through my bones. The mirror before me melts into a silver pool at my feet, revealing dark depths below. Kneeling, I peer in—and countless eyes open in the darkness, blinking up at me with quiet knowing. The dream shudders, and I understand: this abyss is where all my unacknowledged shadows dwell, where every harsh judgment circles back like a boomerang to the core of my own insecurities. The corridor begins to dissolve into swirling mist, and as I wake, the aftertaste of the truth lingers—bitter and cleansing, like medicinal herbs.
