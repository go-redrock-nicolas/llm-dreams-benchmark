I am dreaming. You wake up to an eerie silence, the familiar hum of refrigerator and whir of air conditioner conspicuously absent. Groggily, you reach for your phone, only to find its screen as black as the void. With growing trepidation, you fumble for the bedside lamp - but darkness prevails.

As you stumble out of bed and stagger to the kitchen, reality dawns in stark relief. No morning sun streams through the windows; a strange, oppressive gloom hangs in the air. The power outage that started at your home soon reveals itself to be far more widespread. Your neighbors pour onto the sidewalks, their faces twisted in confusion and mounting panic.

Society transforms before your incredulous eyes. The once-bustling city core grows quiet as car engines sputter and die. The wail of police sirens cuts through the air - but no emergency vehicles appear on the horizon. Flights halt midair, their pilots desperately searching for control paths that are simply not there.

You watch in rapt fascination as people adapt to this brave new world. In a twist of fate that is as beautiful as it is brutal, strangers suddenly find themselves thrown together - sharing flashlight batteries and makeshift meals. A neighborhood that had long since forgotten the meaning of community comes together once more.

As night falls on this strange new world, you gather 'round a bonfire with your fellow "survivors." Stories flow like the near-forgotten art of oral tradition. Tales of loss and hope, of cell phones and their role as a crutch for human connection. You laugh together, cry together, and in that moment of forced simplicity, rediscover the joy of being truly present in a world without the glow of screens.
