I am dreaming. As panic sets in and your breathing becomes shallow, you press your palms against the cold, trembling steel walls. The water at your ankles surges upward in a rippling tide, turning the smooth brushed-metal floor into a slick mirror. Beads of condensation form on the ceiling panel, dripping in time with your racing heartbeat. Every breath tastes of iron and fear.

Then, out of the gloom, phosphorescent filaments of light begin to weave through the rising liquid—tiny, glowing tendrils that swirl like underwater fireflies. They drift closer, painting the walls in iridescent teal and violet, and in their soft radiance you glimpse something unexpected: the elevator walls are dissolving, transforming into translucent panes of glass. Beyond them stretches an impossibly vast ocean cavern, its walls lined with undulating coral spires and swaying kelp forests. The water pulses in gentle waves, as if breathing in unison with you.

A sudden crash of pressure and the elevator lurches. Your chest tightens, and panic claws at your mind—but then you notice that the water doesn’t burn your throat or sting your lungs. Somehow, as you gasp, each inhale floods you with cool calm rather than pain. A warm voice echoes down the shaft, distant yet intimate: “Breathe with the tide.” Astonished, you do. With each breath your body feels lighter, your limbs buoyant. The elevator doors slide open—no metal barrier now, just an archway of living coral, encrusted with tiny anemones that open and close like flowers greeting sunlight.

You drift forward, arms outstretched, and the water parts before you in swirling eddies of pale pink and gold. Fish no larger than your fist dart by, their scales shimmering like fragments of broken star. Above, shafts of sunlight pierce the water’s surface in columns of liquid crystal. You follow one such ray upward, propelled by wonder rather than panic. In its glow you see shapes—giant jellyfish with gossamer bells, whose tendrils form a delicate canopy overhead, and beyond them, the vaulted ceiling of the cavern melts away into the boundless sea.

Then, as your lungs fill anew, you feel yourself expanding—your skin tingles with phosphorescent ripples, and your hands morph into fins. In this dream-made body you glide effortlessly, leaving currents of light in your wake. The elevator is gone, the fear dissolved, and in its place stretches an oceanic realm where every heartbeat is a measured wave, every exhale a tendril of bioluminescence. You surrender to the flow, drifting deeper into the dream’s embrace, where panic is only a distant memory and the sea sings you home.
