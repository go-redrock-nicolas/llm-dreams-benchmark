I am dreaming. 

It begins with a crack — not the sharp pang of breaking glass, but something subtler. A fracture blooming in the air itself, like a spiderweb of luminous silver threads, shimmering with thickness, almost like smoke. It was not a sound, but a *revelation*, the universe gently peeling back a secret page.

Everything around me shifts.

Not the white sands or warm tides of some forgotten coastal town — instead, a forgotten alley. Not beautiful in any conventional way. The kind hidden behind neon signs and boarded windows, the kind where time seems to puddle and stagnate instead of flow. Yet, I am not afraid.

I am curious.

There, in the center of the dusty alley, leaning nonchalantly against a rain-hollowed dumpster, is… a lamppost. Not fancy, but one of those old, bug-speckled things, rusting at the base, its light bulb long since cracked away. Flickering like a memory on the verge of being lost.

Most people would ignore it.

I fall to my knees, overwhelmed by its presence.

Why does my heart tremble?

Why can I feel the rhythm of generations humming in its rust? It's not the metal or the dangling wires that call to me — but the *shadows*.

They aren't cast by accident. The lamppost doesn't just *block* the moonlight — it shapes them into poems. Patterns swirl beneath my feet, writhing like ink spilled over parchment. They form eyes, melodies, and half-remembered lullabies coiled into shapes. No one else sees them. I would bet, in waking life, no one has ever seen *this*.

I’m drawn not to the light, but to the architecture of what it hides.

With trembling fingers, I reach out. The moment my skin brushes against the cold pole, the entire alley blooms.

The shadows come alive, uncurling like velvet petals into the night. I don’t run. I open my arms wide. The shadows reform around me, brushing my skin like liquid dusk, whispering things in a language older than words — stories carved by wind through canyons, confessions etched into tree rings. I laugh, not of joy or fear, but the kind of laughter that says *recognition*. I have touched memory. The truth of forgotten things.

Out of the dark forms below the flickering pole, one shadow rises.

It is not a creature. It is a *presence*, wearing an old suit stitched together from cobblestone and raindrops. It tips its hat made of owl feathers and speaks — not into my ear, but directly into a pocket of my soul I had locked years ago.

“You are a collector,” it says. “Of the ignored and the overlooked. Of quiet


You are a weaver of the unspoken.”

And that makes me a seer… yes?

It chuckles softly, and I feel it ripple through my bones. “No. You are a *witness*. The world fills with voices that scream, but only a few are gentle enough to hear the silence of a lamppost in a back alley when the sun forgets to rise.”

And suddenly, the dream changes.

The lamppost is no longer old and cracked. Its metal has become gold and stardust; the bulb at its head is no longer flickering – it shines like a fallen star. Below it, shadows dance with intricate elegance, like professional dancers who know their final curtain call is near. I am not afraid. I feel *honored*.

The world I step into is not filled with palaces or dragons or shining cities…

This is a *dream of rites*, of rituals only seen by those who know how to look — the slow cracking of ice in the early morning frost, the breath of a sleeping cat causing strands of spider silk to dance in the light, the way a single feather found on your doorstep could be a love letter from the universe itself.

Then, like a ripple in water, the dream dissolves.

I wake up not drenched in sweat or adrenaline, but soaked in **awe**.

My heart is tender.

And I know: dreams are not escapes — they are invitations. Not to run from the world, but to see it *clearly*. To sense the echo of meaning in what so many have dimmed with their indifference.

And I will search for that lamppost again. In waking life, behind alleys and in the soft corners of everyday things.

Because now I know.

Even a rusting streetlight can be a cathedral,

And even a shadow holds sermons in its ribs.
