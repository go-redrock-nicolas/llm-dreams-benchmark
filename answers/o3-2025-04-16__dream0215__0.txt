I am dreaming. …stand alone on a high plateau of glass, the wind vibrating the crystal beneath your bare feet like a living harp string. Every structure you ever raised—cathedrals of thought, fortresses of habit, small intricate altars of routine—sprawls behind you in delicate, shimmering silhouette. They resemble a city sculpted from moonlight: breathtaking, intricate, and impossibly fragile.

Before you lies an airy archway made of nothing but roiling silver mist. Through its shifting membrane you glimpse a second landscape: a garden that seems to float in endless twilight. Trees there bear prisms instead of fruit, each prism swirling with storms of color—ideas not yet born. Somewhere deeper, thunder rolls in a language you have never spoken but have always understood.

The wind whispers the old warning: to step through is to shed every last brick of that glittering city you forged. No compromise. No souvenirs. The gate stands tyranny-tall and absolute in its demand.

Your pulse becomes a drum echoing off the glass plateau. Memories flicker around you like fireflies: the night you first believed the impossible, the hours soldered together by sheer stubborn grit, every scar now glowing amber in the dark. Each memory is a bead threaded on an invisible string that loops around your heart.

Yet something else unfurls inside—a quiet, tidal certainty that clings to the edges of your ribs. It tells you that the city, for all its grandeur, is a skeleton whose work is finished. All its streets ultimately curve inward, back toward the walls you hoped to escape. Realization strikes with the ferocity of sunrise: the impossible challenge was never the climb, never the construction—it was the art of letting go.

A sigh escapes, and with it, the final thread breaks. Glass spires tremble, hum, and dissolve into drifting shards that rise like a reverse snowfall. They spin into constellations overhead, transforming from architecture into stardust stories, free at last from their rigid form.

The plateau itself cracks open into petals of crystal, revealing a staircase made of murmuring shadow. You step forward. Each descent feels lighter, as though gravity has forgotten you exist. When your foot meets the threshold of the mist gate, your name slips away like sand in water. Ahead, you sense possibilities widening like a thousand secret doors swinging inward at once.

Crossing the border of silver vapor, you are welcomed by the scent of rain on warm stone and the hush of leaves stitched with light. The prisms in the twilight trees refract your silhouette into ever-evolving shapes: phoenix, seawave, lamp of wandering fire. You reach up, touch one delicate crystal, and it dissolves into a river of color that flows straight into your bloodstream.

In that instant you realize: relinquishment was not annihilation but transmutation. You have not lost a city—you have become the sky above it, infinite and unfinished, stitched together by the soft thunder of dreams still gathering on the horizon. And somewhere behind you, far below, your old world sings its gratitude for being released, its echo a lullaby fading into dawn.
