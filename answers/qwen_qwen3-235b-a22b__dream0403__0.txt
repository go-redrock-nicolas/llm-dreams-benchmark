I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air around you shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, but it’s not heat—it’s memory. You stand in a corridor of liquid glass, walls that ripple like still water when you touch them, reflecting not your face, but fragments of the moment that haunts you: a glance, a word left unsaid, a door closing too softly to be called a slam. The floor beneath your feet is made of pages from old letters, ink bleeding through the parchment, forming sentences that twist into hieroglyphs when you try to read them.  

A figure waits at the corridor’s end. Their silhouette is familiar, but their edges blur like smoke, features dissolving into a haze of gold and shadow. You know them. You *knew* them. Or perhaps you only knew the version of them that lives in the ache behind your ribs. They hold something in their hands—a mirror, a knife, a flower—all three at once, shifting as you watch. When they speak, their voice is the sound of wind through dead leaves. *“You carry it like a second skeleton,”* they say, though their lips don’t move.  

You don’t ask what *it* is. You already feel it: a weight in your chest, a crystalline growth of resentment and sorrow, jagged and glowing faintly violet, like a bruise under the skin. With every step toward them, the corridor narrows. The walls press closer, now humming with whispers—not voices, but the *idea* of voices, a chorus of every insecurity you’ve ever buried. *“Unloved. Unworthy. Too much. Not enough.”*  

Suddenly, you’re outside, though there were no doors. A desert stretches before you, dunes sculpted from ash and mother-of-pearl. The sky is a writhing tapestry of constellations that rearrange themselves into faces you recognize—some alive, some long gone, all watching. A river cuts through the sand, but it flows *upward*, its waters thick with floating clocks, their hands spinning backward. You kneel at its edge and see your own face in the current, fractured and reforming endlessly.  

The figure appears again, now riding a creature stitched from starlight and smoke—a horse with antlers, its hooves leaving trails of fire that evaporate before touching the ground. They toss the mirror/knife/flower into the river. It sinks, then explodes into a cloud of bioluminescent moths that swarm the sky, devouring the constellations. Darkness falls, but it’s not empty—it’s *alive*, a velvet void that wraps around you like a lung inhaling.  

You wake just before the dawn, the taste of salt on your lips. For a moment, the weight is still there. Then you exhale, and it crumbles into dust, sifted away by a wind that smells of petrichor and forgiveness. The dream lingers, though—a reminder that even the sharpest wounds can become something else in the alchemy of sleep.
