I am dreaming. The world around me is a veil of silver haze, shimmering with the weird iridescence of a soap bubble caught in the light of an eclipsed sun. I am standing at the edge of something vast—an arena, perhaps, but also a cathedral, made entirely of floating stone platforms, spiraling up into a sky that isn't a sky at all but a shifting continuum of stars, storms, and broken glass floating in zero gravity. The air hums with the sound of forgotten songs, each note a memory, each chord a warning: this will shape the rest of your life. I have studied for this for years, sweat, sacrificed. The culmination of everything I have ever known brings me here.
	
	
	
I can feel the weight of my own breath as suddenly very real. I am clothed not in armor or in ceremonial garb, but in manifestations of every decision I've ever made—pieces of myself, stitched together in thought and fragment: a sleeve made of missed opporunities, gloves woven from guarded confessions, boots heavy with buried guilt. Around me, figures appear—competitors? Or reflections? They all wear the same garment, the same idea of themselves twisted into silk by the mind's altar. They do not look at me. They all stare forward, eyes limned with quiet terror and quiet longing, toward the towering presence in the center.
	
	
	
A voice—neither male nor female, but ancient—rumbles from a being of endless mirrors, its form a shifting reflection of everything that has ever trembled on the edge of birth. “The Final Trial,” it intones, “will not measure your strength, or your mind, but your truth.”
	
	
	
The other competitors scream, and then vanish. Into puzzles. Into labyrinths the size of constellations. Into ache. But not me. I remain at the foot of the floating stairs. A bridge forms before me, each step made not of stone—but of memory. I step forward.
	
	
	
Step one: I am ten again, watching the car pull away. She doesn't look back.
	
	
	
Step two: A girl in a library who kissed me like lightning, then walked out of my life like it was scripted in her bones.
	
	
	
Step three: The night I begged forgiveness from someone whose voice I sometimes hear still, whispering through cracks in the pavement.
	
	
	
With every step, the memory becomes real. So real that it bleeds through the cracks in the arena. A rain of tears falls—not from me, but from the sky that feels like me. The mirror-being watches. I fight not with blade or bullet, but with confrontation—the thing I have fled for so long. I do not strike out, I don’t beg to stop.
	
	
	
I see myself lying on the floor of a bedroom, drunk and broken, age twenty-three, with nothing but crumpled drafts of poems and someone's name faded in Sharpie across my forearm. I kneel beside that version of me and say nothing. Just hold his hand until the tremors pass.
	
	
	
The mirror-creature shifts. It doesn't change shape. It becomes clearer.
	
	
	
“Proceed,” it says.
	
	
	
Now I walk across a surface that is not solid, but thought. Ideas swirl beneath my feet. The rules change every heartbeat. Obstacles are not things but feelings—regret, hunger, desire, silence. I must carry each and pass through them without falling apart. Around me, ash falls like perfume. Somewhere, someone is playing a piano that plays itself.
	
	
	
I reach the pinnacle. There is no final boss, no spell to cast, no riddle to solve.
	
	
	
There’s only a mirror.
	
	
	
And someone sitting behind it.
	
	
	
Myself.
	
	
	
We do not speak. We only look.
	
	
	
And when I touch the mirror's surface, it shatters, not into pieces—but into light.
	
	
	
I awaken, gasping, in the real world. The air smells like dawn and quiet triumph. Whether I won or lost no longer frightens me—I brought myself entirely to the altar, and that alone changed me.
	
	
	
The future begins now, forged in the crucible of dream and truth.
