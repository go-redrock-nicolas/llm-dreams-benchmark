I am dreaming. **The Labyrinth of Echoing Glass**  

You stand at the heart of a labyrinth, walls shimmering with iridescent glass that mirrors fragments of your life—whispers of childhood laughter, flashes of triumphs, the warm glow of convictions long held sacred. At the center lies your anchor: a towering obsidian monolith etched with swirling gold runes. For decades, its inscriptions spelled *certainty*—your philosophy, your moral code, the unshakable lens through which you’ve parsed the world. You’ve rebuilt this monument in your mind a thousand times, each crack filled with resolve, each shadow dismissed as illusion.  

Then, a sound. A discordant hum rises from the ground, and the runes begin to *melt*. Gold drips like molten wax, revealing letters beneath—older, thornier symbols you don’t recognize. A voice, neither kind nor cruel, thrums through the air: *What if you’ve been reading it upside-down?*  

You press your palms to the monolith, but it trembles, morphing. Jagged fissures split its surface, and through them, scenes spill out: a starving child you refused to see, a lie you polished into truth, a love you labeled weakness. The glass walls of the labyrinth warp, reflecting versions of yourself—some snarling, others weeping, all trapped in dialogues you’ve silenced. A bridge materializes ahead, woven from paradox: each plank is a blade, each thread a question.  

You step onto it. The blades slice your feet, yet with each cut, the blood blooms into fireflies that illuminate hidden alcoves. In one, a ghostly orchestra plays a symphony of your doubts; in another, a garden of withered ideals waits, roots begging for rain. The monolith crumbles entirely now, and in its place grows a tree of mirrored leaves, each reflecting a stranger’s face. Their stories pour into you—contradictions, yes, but also harmonies, a cacophony that starts to sound like a chorus.  

You wake clutching your chest, where the tree now roots. Its branches ache, heavy with unanswerable questions. But the leaves? They catch the light differently now.
