I am dreaming. The workplace is a whirlwind of chaos. My coworkers tense with anxiety as I walk past, whispering behind cupped hands, glancing nervously over their shoulders. The air feels heavy, like the damp, oppressive heat before a storm. My boss paces the floor, his footsteps echoing sharply in the silence, his eyes darting from one face to the next. I can feel his gaze boring into my back as I slide into my chair. My desk is cluttered with files, emails piling up in the inbox like an avalanche waiting to happen. I can hear the whispers growing louder, more urgent. They say he's looking for a scapegoat. I know it's only a matter of time before he finds one.

I feel trapped. My chest tightens, my breath coming in shallow gasps. My hands tremble as I click through endless spreadsheets and reports, my mind racing with deadlines and quotas that seem impossible to meet. I glance at the clock, watching the minutes tick by with agonizing slowness. I can't take much more of this. My heart pounds in my chest, my thoughts spinning in a dizzying spiral of desperation. I need to get out of here. I need to escape. But how? The fear grips me, tightening its hold, dragging me deeper into the abyss. I am trapped, and I know it.
