I am dreaming. The dream begins gently, as they often do, with a quiet sense of tranquility. I am standing in a vast, open field, its swaying grass gently touched by a soft afternoon breeze. The sky above is a brilliant spectrum of blue, speckled with wispy clouds that drift slowly across the heavens. In the distance, a small village lies nestled among rolling hills, its quaint cottages and tall, leafy trees creating a picturesque scene of serenity.

But the peace is fleeting. As the first hour of my dream progresses, I notice a peculiar change in the air. The gentle breeze becomes a bit chillier, and an eerie sense of foreboding starts to creep in. A few birds, formerly chattering merrily, take flight and disappear toward the east. I feel a subtle shift, an early warning sign of something amiss.

As the dream transitions into the second hour, I find myself back in the village, but now the once warm and inviting cottages seem dull, their windows dark and foreboding. The once vibrant market square is deserted, with only a few stray animals wandering about, their movements erratic and nervous. I sense an impending danger, though I cannot put a finger on what exactly it is.

The villagers start to murmur, their conversations filled with confusion and fear. A loud, ominous rumble echoes through the valley, and the ground beneath my feet begins to tremble. The sky darkens, with noxious clouds rolling in, blackening the once cheerful blue. My dream-self feels an urgency, yet I remain calm, my mind unusually focused.

I see it. A jagged, dark crack appears in the earth, stretching from the mouth of the valley and branching out in all directions. The crack grows wider and wider, and from its depths, foul, black smoke billows forth, smelling of sulphur and decay. The world around me is disintegrating into chaos, yet I stay calm. The dream helps me to maintain a sense of composure, even as the world around me crumbles.

I find myself now, running through the streets, trying to alert the villagers. I call out, warning them of the catastrophe that is about to befall them. But despite my desperate shouts, the villagers seem deaf to my warnings. Their faces are blank, their movements automaton-like, as if they cannot perceive the danger that is so obvious to me.

The rumbling grows louder, and the crack continues to expand, tearing the village apart. Buildings start to crumble, and the sound of shattering glass and crumbling stone fills the air. Itâ€™s as if the very fabric of this dream world is unraveling, with me as the only one who knows what is coming.

As I run, I realize that no amount of shouting or pleading will awaken the villagers from their stupor. The crack now reaches the outskirts of the village, and the ground begins to sink in places, forming enormous chasms that swallow houses and trees whole. The sky is now almost entirely black, except for an eerie green glow emanating from the crack, which has expanded into a gaping, yawning chasm.

The dream shifts again, and I realize I have only one hour left. The scene around me is one of utter destruction. The village is gone, consumed by the crack. The rolling hills are now barren, the once lush grass and trees reduced to charred husks. The air is thick with noxious fumes and the horizon glows menacingly, as if the sun itself is drowning in some monstrous void.

I stand on a high hill, the wind howling around me, carrying the bitter scent of decay. The world is now void of all life, save for myself, a lone observer in this apocalyptic dreamscape. The crack now spans the entire horizon, and from it, creatures unlike anything I have seen begin to emerge, their forms twisted and monstrous, creating an unholy cacophony.

And yet, despite the destruction and fear, my serene dream-self stands unwavering. The dream forces me to witness the unfolding catastrophe, the unfolding mystery that must be solved, the truth that must be uncovered. I am the Believer, the Seeker, the one who has not yet unraveled this mystery. The fire, the groaning, the hissing laughter of the unearthly forces, all swirl around me, yet I am calm.

I am still trying to solve this conundrum when the dream crests, the crack finally reaches the clouds and begins to rise. The change is occurring now, the hour has passed, and I wake with a jolt, sitting up in bed, soaked in sweat. The horrifying scenes that unfolded reeking with the pungent smell of sulfur and ash, leaving an indelible mark on my restless soul.
