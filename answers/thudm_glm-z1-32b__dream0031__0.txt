I am dreaming. The subway carriage is dark, its shaking feeling real.  Hundreds of shadows sway in the pale, yellow emergency lights.  A mannext to me whispers a name I don't recognize: "Lucifer. Lucifer."  My heart races, each thud echoing through the tunnel's emptiness.  The train jerks to life, accelerating wildly.  Windows are replaced by moving paintings:.faces morphing into winged serpents that hiss biblical phrases in Latin.  A child's laughter rings out, melodic yet unnerving; it belongs to no one.  My palms sweat as I grip a rusted handrail that's snakeskin cool.  The "next stop" sign blinks:

"HELLH0US3"

The doors open.  Cold, petrified silence pours in, carrying the scent of wet stone and burnt incense.  I step out. the air pulses like a beating heart.  Words claw at me from the walls:  
"REPENT"  
"FALL"  
"EAT AND BECOME"
The air is thick with the stench of iron and burnt myrrh, every breath a struggle against suffocation. My lungs cling to the memory of subway stale air as the platform vanishes behind a wall of jagged pillars slick with algae, their tops lost in a suffocating green fog. The child’s laughter crescendos now, a choir of hundreds joining in a harmonic that fractures bone—until it stops.  

A door creaks open inches from my face, carved from black obsidian veined with gold, resembling the cross-section of a sun. The numeral "666" glows faintly on the brass knocker, its letters dripping like liquid mercury. A figure slithers through the threshold, not human but *almost*: a female silhouette with a serpent’s scaled torso, her mouth curling into a smile that reveals rows of serrated teeth. She offers me a scarlet key on a chain that oozes black ink.  

“It’s time to choose,” she purrs, her voice a ribcage rattle. The key pulses, its blade a living thing, slithering like a tiny vine onto my palm. Across the hall, shadows twist against walls hung with tapestries depicting my life—if I had one. There, in vivid crimson thread, is my name: **LOST**.  

The corridor ahead splits. To the left, a banquet table groans under platters of glowing, half-melted fruit. Skulls as cups, their orbits filled with wine the color of dried blood. A voice, my mother’s, whispers, *“You’re starving, darling.”*  

To the right, a staircase descends into a void where figures in gray suits shovel coal into furnaces, their faces melted into grotesque masks. A child peers over the railing, my own daughter’s eyes vacant, offering me a rattle made of her own teeth. *“Play with me,”* she says, her voice a screech of static.  

The key burns. I glance at my hand. The sulfuric heat climbs my arm, but when I squeeze my fist, it transmutes—the key becomes a bullet, chambersed in the gun clutched in my hand.  

The gun’s barrel points to my temple.  

The trigger is warm.  

Somewhere, a train grinds to a halt.
