I am dreaming. …I stand at the threshold of a forgotten temple, half-devoured by jungle vines so luminous they glow like emerald fireflies in the evening light. The air hums with the distant chorus of frogs and the slow pulse of thunder beyond violet-black clouds. I brush aside a curtain of orchid blossoms and step into a vestibule where time itself feels hushed, as if centuries have paused to watch me breathe.

The floor is a mosaic of obsidian and moonstone, depicting a river that seems to ripple when I move. At its center, rising from cracked marble, is a monolith—the color of wet ash—pierced by shafts of sunlight that filter through holes in the shattered ceiling. Carved across its face is the riddle no living tongue has ever solved:

“Breathe the word that binds the sky to the tides:
  A silence that sings,
  A shadow that guides.”

Beneath the inscription swirl pictographs: a serpent devouring its own tail, an eclipse frozen mid-dimness, and a single feather balanced on a mountain peak. The symbols feel alive, reshuffling themselves whenever I avert my eyes, as though reluctant to reveal their final configuration.

I run my fingertips over the etchings. Each groove is warm—not the warmth of sunlight, but of a slumbering heart. With every touch, memories that aren’t mine flare inside my head: sailing with star-maps stitched onto silk sails; tasting rain collected from silver lotus petals; laughing beside companions whose faces blur like watercolors in a downpour. The temple seems to trade secrets for sensations.

A tremor rattles the floor. The serpent mosaic slithers, its scales glinting. A soft hiss rises, then words, whispered in a voice made of layered echoes: “Find the silence that sings, wanderer.”

I close my eyes and listen. First, I hear the wind combing through the jungle canopy like fingers through harp strings. Then, the hush beneath the wind—a velvet quiet. Deeper still, beneath the hush, is a note: a single tone so faint it feels like the memory of music. The silence that sings.

I shape my breath around the tone, exhaling the unspoken syllable it requests. It isn’t a word in any language—more an unveiling, a turning of an invisible key. The monolith shivers. Dust plumes upward, forming miniature galaxies in the pale light. The stone face splits, revealing a hollow core filled with liquid radiance the color of dawn.

From that light steps an ivory heron, eyes the hue of twilight seas. It bows, spreading wings upon which constellations glitter. A smooth shard of obsidian hangs at its throat like a pendant. It gestures, inviting me to peer into the shard.

I see my reflection, yet not my reflection: I am older and younger, crowned with orbiting moons, my skin tattooed by the river mosaic’s silver spirals. In the shard, I watch myself utter the answer:

“The riddle asks not for sound, but for surrender. I am the breath between lightning and thunder. I am the space where tides turn.”

The temple answers with a resounding heartbeat. Vines bloom overnight in iridescent hues. The serpent locks its tail, completing the circle. The eclipse depicted on the monolith burns away, unveiling an unblemished sun that pours golden rain through the cracks in the ceiling. Each droplet lands as a seed, instantly sprouting miniature trees that bear crystal fruit gleaming with spectra.

Suddenly, I comprehend: this isn’t a puzzle meant to be solved by intellect but by resonance. The silence that sings is the moment of acknowledgment—the surrender to wonder. The ancient builders carved it not as a gatekeeper of knowledge, but as a litmus test for reverence. Only a dreamer who can harmonize with awe can command the temple’s last gift.

The heron dips its beak into the radiant core and lifts a single drop, which hovers like a trembling pearl. It nudges the droplet toward my chest. When it touches, it sinks into me, cool as midnight water, yet blazing with starlight. My ribs become windows of phosphorescent crystal, and through them I see endless constellations turning, all nested within my own heart.

Columns groan; the temple begins to unfurl, not collapse. Walls stretch skyward into filigreed spires. Stairs coil outward into the open air, leading upward, upward, until they dissolve into a bridge woven of sunbeams and birdsong. The heron takes flight along that bridge, and I follow, footsteps light as breath.

As we rise, the jungle below transforms into a map of dreams: rivers chime like harps; mountains flex like slumbering giants; and entire cities of forgotten civilizations flicker alive, their streets paved with mirror-glass. I sense each of their stories braided through the single note still humming in my chest.

We reach a doorway of nothingness—a frame where void and possibility mingle. Beyond it lies a canvas of unpainted dawn. The heron alights upon my shoulder for a heartbeat, then dives into the blankness, scattering stars that bloom into multicolored auroras. I step through.

The moment my foot crosses, I wake—yet even in waking, the riddle’s answer thrums beneath my everyday thoughts:

Remember the silence that sings.
Guard the shadow that guides.
For in the breath between lightning and thunder,
Dreamers rewrite the sky.
