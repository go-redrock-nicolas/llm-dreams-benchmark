I am dreaming. **I am dreaming.**  

I stand in a world of liquid color, where the sky bleeds from sapphire to molten gold, pulsing like the breath of some unseen giant. The ground beneath my feet is not solid but shifts like quicksilver, forming hills that rise and collapse in slow-motion sighs. The air hums—a soundless vibration that tingles against my skin, as if the universe itself is whispering secrets just beyond comprehension.  

Before me, floating in the trembling air, is a blank canvas—suspended by nothing, pristine and infinite. It isn’t just white; it is absence given form, a void waiting to be shaped by thought alone. As I reach out, my fingers don’t touch it—they dip *into* it, like plunging into still water, and the ripples that spread are made of starlight.  

Instantly, the world responds. The canvas becomes a living thing, breathing in my intention. Shapes begin to writhe across its surface—a tree made of liquid shadow sprouts gnarled branches that twist into fractals before dissolving into flocks of crystalline birds. Their wings scatter prismatic dust, each speck a tiny world, a microcosm of stories yet untold. The birds take flight, and as they soar, their colors bleed into the sky, rewriting the horizon in hues that have no name.  

The dream shudders, shifts. The landscape responds. A silver river carves itself into existence beneath my feet, its waters singing in a language older than words. Faces flicker beneath its surface—wisps of forgotten dreams, fragments of souls that never fully woke. They reach for me, beckoning, but before I can touch them, the canvas trembles again.  

This time, it does not show me visions—it *demands* them. My thoughts are no longer mine; they spill freely, painting monsters and angels and cities of glass that rise and shatter in the same instant. I am no longer just the dreamer—I am the dream itself. And somewhere, in the distance, a voice (or is it the wind?) murmurs:  

*"Now, tell me—whose reflection do you see in the water?"*  

I look down. The river is still. My face is not the one I know.  

Then—  
I wake.
