I am dreaming. The moment the dream unfurls, you find yourself standing on the slick, glimmering deck of an impossibly large airship that hangs, lantern-lit, among purple storm clouds. Wind snaps the crimson sails overhead, and lightning blooms like silver vines against the dark. You can feel the hum of the engines underfoot—part mechanical, part heartbeat—as though the vessel itself were alive and anxious.

At the helm beside you stands a figure whose presence prickles the back of your neck: a co-worker from waking life, yet rendered here in unsettling exaggeration. Their coat is stitched from torn memos and unfinished emails, fluttering in invisible drafts. Instead of normal eyes, they bear polished obsidian stones that show only your own distorted reflection. Though they say nothing, your gut twists with a wordless dread every time their gaze grazes you.

A brass compass dangles from your hand, but the needle spins in wild spirals, disoriented by the storm. Each spin sends a resonance through your chest—an echo of the confusion you feel around this person when awake: frustration without explanation, anger with no origin story. The ship lurches, and the horizon folds like origami, forming a canyon of cloud where thunder mutters like a disapproving crowd.

The captain’s voice booms from nowhere, instructing you and your uneasy partner to steer through the canyon together. The wheel is enormous, carved from dark walnut, and requires four arms to turn—two of yours, two of theirs. The instant you both grip the spokes, a bolt of white-gold electricity lashes the deck, and the wood beneath your hands takes on a living warmth. Memories—some yours, some not—flare across the wheel like phosphorescent tattoo ink:

• A childhood cafeteria where laughter turned sharp and mocking.  
• A cubicle maze bathed in fluorescent resentment.  
• A single, accusing e-mail subject line: “URGENT.”  
• The colleague’s restless footsteps pacing behind your chair.

You begin to sense the true machinery of your animosity: tiny incidents, half-noticed gestures, even shared anxieties that migrated from empathic connection into mutual irritation.

The dream changes texture. The airship’s deck transforms into a floating glass walkway above a black sea. Beneath the glass, luminous jellyfish drift like ethereal lanterns. Your teammate is now a negative-space silhouette—an outline filled with the same starless ocean stretching beneath you. A single word pulses on their chest in flickering neon: UNDERSTAND.

You realize the only way forward is to speak to that word. So, you do—at first unwillingly, then with a growing surge of honesty. You describe exactly how their presence makes your stomach knot, how their off-hand remarks slice like paper, how baffling it is to feel this anger. Each confession etches a glowing symbol onto the glass, filling it with warm honey-gold light. The silhouette listens—silent, motionless—but their starless interior begins to dissolve into a milky galaxy. Nebulae bloom where hostility once reigned.

As you continue, your voice shifts from accusation to curiosity: “Why do you make me feel unseen? What echoes do you carry that clash against mine?” The last word leaves your lips, and the walkway shatters—not violently, but like ice melting in accelerated time. You both fall, yet you are not afraid; the jellyfish rise to catch you on their soft bells, lifting you in slow motion toward a sky now swirling with sunrise colors.

High above, an enormous clock hangs suspended, its hands winding backward. You sense the chance to rewind, to revisit first impressions, to offer a new lens. The colleague, no longer night-colored, drifts next to you in living hues. Their coat of shredded paperwork mends itself into a quilt of bright origami cranes—each crane a task completed, an apology spoken, a boundary respected. They meet your eyes, and at last you see human softness within.

The clock chimes. With each chime:

1. The storm’s thunder lowers to a rolling purr.  
2. The jellyfish burst into starlight and scatter across the sky.  
3. Your chest feels lighter, as though a backpack of invisible stones has been loosened and tipped away.

Finally, you both alight upon a circular garden suspended in the clouds. The soil is chocolate-dark and fragrant; seeds lie scattered like tiny opals. A weathered sign reads, “Plant what you need.” You kneel and press a seed into the earth while your once-adversary does the same. Instantly, twin saplings spiral upward—yours blossoming into brilliant, flame-colored tulips (passion, assertiveness), theirs into silvery lavender (calm, patience). Their roots weave together beneath the soil, unseen yet strong.

You look at one another. The negative charge that once crackled between you now feels like a clean current, capable of lighting lanterns instead of setting fires. A breeze passes, carrying the scent of petrichor and possibility. Somewhere below, the airship’s horn sounds a deep, forgiving note, as though inviting the new you back aboard.

Everything blurs, like watercolor left in the rain, until only sensation remains: wind over skin, warmth at the heart, and a clear, ringing awareness that conflict is often a mirror begging to be cleaned, not smashed.

With that, the dream exhales. You stir in your waking bed, the echo of cloud-gardens and paper-crane coats lingering in the half-light of dawn, and you understand—if only for a trembling moment—how to steer your shared wheel without letting the storm decide your course.
