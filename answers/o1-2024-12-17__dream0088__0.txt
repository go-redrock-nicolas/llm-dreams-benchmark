I am dreaming. You find yourself tethered to a desk the size of a football field. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead like insistent hornets, illuminating a cascading mountain of files, each folder emblazoned with bold red letters screaming urgent at you. Phones ring in every corner; a babble of digital voices shrieks deadlines upon deadlines, layering over each other until your head hums like a hive. And yet, you keep typing, flipping through pages, scrawling notes that never seem to matter once you’ve written them down—because there’s always another sheet requiring attention, another coworker tapping urgently on your shoulder.

Suddenly, the walls of the office burst outward. Your desk, with its endless stacks of tasks, begins to float on a sea of ticking clocks, each counting down a separate project’s final hour. As you scramble to cling onto your obligations, leadership appears before you, shimmering and towering like holographic giants. They speak in a chorus, commanding new priorities to descend upon you—paper storms that swirl and flutter, filling the air. Every attempt you make to address one file sees two more drop before you.

Your heart pounds. You look around desperately for an exit as the floor crumbles beneath your feet. The deadlines are no longer just words on a page—they have taken on a life of their own. Red lines extend from the documents, slithering like vines around your wrists, tugging you deeper into a giant sinkhole of incomplete work.

And yet, in that moment of suffocation and impossibility, you catch a glimpse of something bright in the distance—a flicker of a golden edge. You close your eyes against the crush of demands, feeling their weight. When you open them again, the fluorescent lights are gone, the red-ink markings are melting like wax from a candle. Standing before you is a single door, shining like a salvific dawn. You reach out a trembling hand, unsure what waits on the other side, but filled with the sudden certainty that perhaps even these endless deadlines can become stepping stones toward a more expansive horizon.
