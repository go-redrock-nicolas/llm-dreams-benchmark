I am dreaming. I'm in charge of a dangerous operation where every detail is critical. My team is performing beautifully, until they start making minor mistakes.
Adrenaline courses through my veins as I oversee the mission, my peripheral vision sharp and my focus unwavering. I feel the weight of responsibility on my shoulders; this operation will determine the course of history.
Everything is moving smoothly, precision and skill on display everywhere I look. Then, in a split second, I spot a misplaced bolt in the device we're assembling. My teammate's hand hovers over it, poised to make a critical modification.
With lightning reflexes, I lunge forward, catching their arm in mid-air and preventing the catastrophe theoretically happening. "Danger," I shout. "We need to re-calibrate. Now."
Sirens begin to blare as my team springs into action, swiftly adjusting the setup per my urgent instructions. I watch the clock with growing unease, aware that time is not on our side.
Finally, the device is ready once again, this time perfectly configured. I take a deep breath, calm my racing heart, and nod. "Let's proceed with caution."
The next 30 minutes are positively surreal, an eternity of suspense and uncertainty. My team extricates with expertise, fixing several more near-misses with superhuman speed and acumen.

At long last, the mission is an irrefutable success, though mentally exhausting for both my team and I. High-fives and grins are exchanged around the room as the adrenaline now feels elating instead of suffocating.
I lean back in my chair, savoring a cup of coffee to calm my racing thoughts. That was the closest call of my life, but it ultimately ended in victory. Other operations await in the wings, but for now, I'll savor this unbelievable triumph.
