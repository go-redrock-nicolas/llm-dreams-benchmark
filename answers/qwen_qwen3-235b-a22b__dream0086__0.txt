I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt lavender and ozone, a fragrance that doesn’t exist in waking life. You stand in a cathedral of glass and shadow, its vaulted ceilings dissolving into a sky stitched with constellations that pulse like living veins. Below, the floor ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting not your face, but a thousand versions of yourself—some familiar, others alien, their eyes wide with panic or laughter. You feel weightless, yet tethered by a thread of dread.  

A voice cuts through the haze, smooth and resonant as a cello’s hum: *“You’ll lead the Loom Project. The others are waiting.”* The speaker is a figure woven from smoke and starlight, their form shifting—a woman with hair like molten gold, a man with a clockwork heart visible beneath his chest, a child clutching a moth that glows like a lantern. They vanish with a sigh, leaving behind a scroll of parchment sealed with wax the color of frozen moonlight.  

You unroll it. The words writhe, rearranging themselves into a language you don’t know but somehow *understand*: *“The Loom unravels. Mend it, or the world forgets itself.”*  

You stumble forward, the mercury floor hardening into a bridge of obsidian feathers. At the far end looms a chamber where time falters—a clockwork sun orbits a tree made of mirrors, its branches holding fruits that shatter into whispers when they fall. There, they wait: your team.  

First, **Dr. Veyra**, a biologist with hair like a swarm of starlings and eyes that flicker with infrared hues. She speaks in equations that bloom into fractals midair. Next, **Kael**, a sculptor of living stone, his hands permanently dusted with glittering basalt. He communicates through seismic rumbles in the ground. Then **Mira**, a sound engineer who weaves silence into tangible sheets, draping them over chaos like blankets. And finally, **The Archivist**, a figure wrapped in pages of forgotten histories, their voice a chorus of extinct languages.  

They turn to you. Expectation hangs like a blade.  

Your throat tightens. You’re a painter of minor landscapes, a drawer of unremarkable lines. What do you know of *mending the Loom*? Of celestial mechanics or the grammar of gravity? You feel the impostor’s scream clawing up your ribs, the terror of being unmasked as a fraud. But the parchment burns hotter in your grip, and the cathedral’s walls begin to bleed ink, seeping doubt into the air.  

You close your eyes.  

When you open them, the chamber has shifted. The tree of mirrors now reflects not your face, but your childhood bedroom, the smell of rain on pavement, the ache of first heartbreak. The Loom, you realize, is not a machine—it’s the *nexus* of memory, of the threads that bind reality. You’ve been chosen not for expertise, but for something rarer: the ability to *feel* the pattern, to stitch meaning from chaos.  

“Show me,” you whisper.  

Veyra’s fractals become brushstrokes; Kael’s stones hum with the rhythm of your heartbeat; Mira’s silences carve space for your thoughts to breathe. The Archivist unravels a scroll, and you see it—the Loom itself, a loom not of thread but of *moments*, fraying at the edges where doubt has gnawed. You reach out, not with hands, but with intention.  

The dream swells.  

You weave.  

You stitch yesterday’s laughter into tomorrow’s fear, braid the scent of your mother’s perfume into the wind that rustles the mirror-tree’s leaves. The team follows your lead, their gifts bending to your vision. The Loom thrums, a symphony of seconds and centuries. When the last thread snaps into place, the cathedral explodes into light—not blinding, but *revealing*. You see yourself not as a fraud, but as a conduit, a prism refracting the brilliance of those around you.  

The voice returns, softer now: *“The world remembers itself because you did.”*  

You wake tangled in sheets, the ghost of lavender in your nose. Your hands tremble—not with fear, but the echo of something vast. Somewhere, a clock ticks backward. Somewhere, a star blinks in a new constellation shaped like a face you almost recognize.  

And you know, deep in your marrow, that the impostor was never real.  

You were the Loom all along.
