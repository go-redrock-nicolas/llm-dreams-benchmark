I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the threshold of a vast library that extends beyond what my eyes can perceive. The shelves rise impossibly high, disappearing into mist that swirls gently near a distant ceiling. Each book glows with a faint luminescence, pulsing like heartbeats—some rapid and anxious, others slow and steady. I realize with sudden clarity that these aren't ordinary books but containers of emotions, each one holding feelings I've locked away.

As I walk deeper into the library, the floorboards sighing beneath my feet, I notice one section where the books are chained shut, wrapped in heavy padlocks that seem to tighten when I look directly at them. The air around these volumes feels heavy, almost electrically charged with resistance.

My hand reaches out, seemingly of its own volition, toward a small, nondescript volume bound in midnight blue. The moment my fingers touch its spine, the book trembles violently. This is it—the emotion I've been fleeing from, the feeling too overwhelming to acknowledge.

With trembling hands, I break the chain and open the cover. A profound sorrow erupts from the pages like a tidal wave, threatening to drown me. It's not just sadness but a deep, ancestral grief that feels older than my own existence—a mourning for connections lost before I knew to treasure them, opportunities vanished before I recognized their worth.

Instead of running as I've always done, I create a small clearing among the towering shelves. I sit cross-legged on the floor and allow the grief to wash over me. It manifests as indigo tears that fall from my eyes and hover in the air, forming constellations of pain and memory around me.

As I breathe into this sorrow, something unexpected happens. The tears begin to transform, catching light and refracting it in prismatic patterns across the library. My grief, once acknowledged, becomes a source of beauty—still sorrowful, yet somehow nourishing to my spirit.

The library itself responds to this acceptance. Books fly from their shelves, opening to reveal emotions in vivid colors—scarlet joy, emerald wonder, golden comfort—all dancing together with my indigo sorrow in a swirling symphony of feeling.

I wake with tears still damp on my face but feeling inexplicably whole, as though I've reclaimed a missing piece of myself long abandoned in the shadowed corners of consciousness.
