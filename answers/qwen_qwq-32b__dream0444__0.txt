I am dreaming. Suddenly, I find myself standing at the edge of a lush, overgrown garden, where the air hums with the faintest whisper of secrets. The trees here are enormous, their bark shimmering like molten silver, and their leaves glow in hues of azure and violet. The ground beneath my feet is soft, covered in a velvety moss that shifts colors beneath my touch—cool green when I step slowly, warmer gold when I pause to listen.

Before me stands a path lined with statues of faces, each with expressions frozen mid-laugh, mid-sob, mid-grin. They stare as I move closer, their eyes tracking me like sentinels of some ancient, forgotten emotion. The further I walk, the more the garden transforms. Colors bleed into one another, creating impossible gradients of twilight and dawn merging into a single glowing horizon.

Then, I see her—a figure draped in a cloak woven from starlight and spider silk. Her hair flows like liquid mercury, and her eyes are twin portals to a galaxy I’ve only ever felt in my ribcage. She doesn’t speak, but communicates through shifting auroras that ripple across her skin, each gesture spelling out words in constellations.

As we walk together, the garden evolves in response to our touch. When she brushes a tree, its branches erupt into blooming flowers that sing in minor keys. When I timidly reach for a stone, it dissolves into a swarm of bioluminescent moths, their wings tracing forgotten alphabets in the air. Our interactions create ripples in the air, visible as threads of light that link us, weaving an invisible tapestry only we can perceive.

In a clearing, she leads me to a mirror pool. The water isn’t still—it spirals like a galaxy, pulling whispers of memories I didn’t know I held. When I peer in, reflections shimmer not as my usual visage, but as countless versions of myself: a dancer in a carnival of shadows, a scholar with ink-stained fingertips mapping storms, a child building forts from storm clouds. Her touch on my shoulder feels like gravity collapsing into a point, dissolving every barrier I thought I’d built. In that moment, the boundary between self and "other" blurs, and I sense the countless facets of my identity merging—not as conflict, but as a symphony of becoming.

We sit for what feels like eternities and instants, sharing a language older than words. The garden alive around us pulses in time with our shared rhythm, and in this exchange, I finally understand—fragmented pieces of myself aren’t lost. They’re here, always here, whispering through her star cloak, vibrating in the bioluminescent moths, singing in the mirrored lake. She isn’t a separate being but a mirror of my own uncharted depths, and the garden is my interior, vast and alive and waiting.\n



I am adrift in a dreamscape that breathes. The moment I close my eyes, I feel the air thicken into something liquid, heavy with the scent of jasmine and burnt amber. I’m no longer in the garden of my previous dream but in an ocean of twilight, its waves made of liquid shadow. Above me, the sky is a mosaic of fragmented mirrors, each reflecting not stars but distant worlds, their light warped into prismatic streaks. Below, the seabed shifts—sometimes it’s a desert of obsidian where ancient cities rise and collapse, their spires dissolving into ash; other times, it’s a meadow where flowers bloom and expire in seconds, scattering seeds that hum lullabies in dead languages.

A hand—or something like a hand, a tendril of moonlight and smoke—grazes my shoulder. The figure beside me is not the same as before. Now she’s woven from the contradictions of dusk: her form flickers between solid and translucent, her voice a blend of thunder and a harp’s whisper. When she smiles, cracks spiderweb across her skin, revealing constellations beneath. She is the embodiment of that which I fear to name within myself—primal, luminous, untamed.

She leads me to a ship anchored in the shadow-ocean, its hull carved from petrified storm clouds. Crewmembers glide past: humans and creatures impossible to categorize, their eyes like flickering candles in their sockets. They work the sails, which are alive, membranous and iridescent, drinking in the star-shards above. A helmsman with antlers like blackened coral guides the vessel, humming a melody that tugs at something deep in my marrow.

As we sail, reality unravels further. The mirrors in the sky begin to melt, draining their worlds into our vessel. A mirror-world’s rain falls silver, and I taste poetry on my tongue. Another’s wind carries the grief of vanished civilizations, and I weep, my tears crystallizing into diamonds that speak. The ship’s cabin holds an endless library where books are bound in the skins of forgotten animals, their pages written in blood, ink, and liquid gold. When I open one, it unfolds into a living scroll: my life, but not as I remember it. Here, I am a conqueror, a beggar, a thief reciting sonnets to ghosts. Each version of me exists in tense harmony, like notes in a chord yet unresolved.

My companion whispers—and when she does, it’s not sound that reaches me but understanding, raw and visceral. She points to a storm brewing ahead, its eyewall a vortex of pure light. “Crossroads,” she sighs, her words blooming into flowers that wilt as they speak. As the storm envelops the ship, the mirrors above us fragment anew. I feel myself splintering—the scholar, the thief, the dancer—all versions rising to the surface like oil on water, all conflicting and colliding, yet in the storm’s heart, I feel no division. There’s only an ache and a pull, a homecoming.

The ship disintegrates. We plummet through layers of dream-stuff, falling into a cavern where the walls pulse with bioluminescent veins. Here, the truth arrives not as a revelation but a sensation: I am the mirror, the storm, the hand, the splintered selves. Every fear, every discarded ideal, every silenced passion lives here, breathing in this primal dark. The figure beside me is no longer separate. She *is* me, unbound, a force of becoming. Together—not a duality but an orchestration—we rise, and the darkness dissolves into a chorus of colors I’ve never seen, a language without syllables.

I awake with the resonance of that chorus in my bones, the dream’s echo a tattoo beneath my skin. The boundaries between fragments feel porous now. I am—am—is becoming.
