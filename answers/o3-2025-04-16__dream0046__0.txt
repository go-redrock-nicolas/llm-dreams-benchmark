I am dreaming. …freeze for a heartbeat, poised between wonder and fear.  

A lavender dusk cloaks the city, but in the sky the stars judder and rearrange themselves like panicked birds. Traffic lights blink out of sequence—red, green, then yellow—as if time itself is stuttering. Storefront neon flickers in Morse-code bursts you somehow understand: something is coming.  

You step onto the sidewalk. The pavement hums beneath your shoes, vibrating with a low, cello-deep resonance that sets your pulse to the same rhythm. A newspaper boy pedals past, but every paper in his basket is blank except for one bold headline: LISTEN TO THE GROUND. He doesn’t notice; the pages look normal to him.  

Across the avenue, trees shed their leaves all at once, releasing not foliage but tiny origami cranes that spiral upward instead of fluttering down. They form a shimmering vortex above the streetlights, pointing inland toward the river. You follow their paper-winged trail, heart hammering. Only you can see the cranes. Everyone else walks beneath them, faces glued to glowing phones, earbuds sealing them in private soundtracks.  

A city bus screeches to the curb. For a second the side windows reflect a scene that isn’t there—an empty shoreline, tide pulled impossibly far from the sand, exposing black sea-bed ribs. Then the reflection snaps back to impatient commuters. You gasp: the ocean is inhaling, preparing to roar back in. No one else notices.  

Sirens wail—but they’re not emergency vehicles. They’re wind-born voices, ancient and melodic, stitched with urgency. “Gather the lanterns,” they sing, “wake the sleepers.” The notes seem to slip straight through skull and skin, vibrating in your bones.  

At the riverfront you find the water recoiling like a frightened animal, revealing slick cobblestones scattered with broken pocketwatches—all ticking backward. Moonlight drips from the sky in liquid rivulets, pooling on the exposed riverbed. You touch a droplet; it clouds with memories of children flying paper kites, of lovers laughing beneath fireworks. The droplet trembles, then pops, erasing the moment it showed you.  

You know, suddenly and without doubt, that these are stolen seconds, the city’s moments being siphoned away. Time is unraveling, the tidal wave of lost hours rushing back to claim its debt. If no one acts, dawn itself may never arrive.  

Your mouth is dry, but your voice feels full of thunder. You turn to a cluster of strangers who stand mesmerized by their reflections in darkened shop windows. “Look at the river!” you cry. “Listen to the ground!” Some glance up, confusion skittering across their faces like startled fish, but they return to their screens. A little girl, though, tilts her head. She hears the cello-hum beneath the street and watches the origami cranes whirl above. She believes.  

She hands you a chalk stick from her backpack. You don’t question it—you know what to do. Kneeling, you scribble sigils of spirals, arrows, broken hourglasses across the cobblestones, creating a glowing mosaic that thrums with the same subterranean bass note. The ground answers, cracking open along your chalk lines. Light pours out—dawnlight, saved and hidden deep below.  

The river halts its retreat, held in a gold web that spans bank to bank. The pocketwatches freeze, their hands aligning on twelve. All around, the cranes burst into gentle flame, becoming tiny lanterns that drift over the rooftops. One by one, people raise their eyes. Screens dim. Earbuds fall. A collective, trembling breath sweeps the crowd: they see it now.  

You stand at the epicenter of the chalk constellation, feeling dawnrise surge through your veins. The siren-wind quiets, replaced by the first birdsong of a new morning. You realize the emergency isn’t merely a disaster to avert; it’s an awakening to ignite.  

The light flares—white, warm, absolute. The dream fractures into prisms.  

Your eyelids flutter. You wake, heart still racing, palms smeared with chalk-dust that wasn’t there before, and far off, a single paper crane catches the real-world breeze, spiraling upward in silent promise.
