I am dreaming. The sky above is a sapphire dome laced with veins of gold, as if the universe itself is breathing. Below me, the ground pulses gently, alive in a way that defies reality. Each step I take releases a sound—a harp note, a harp note, a harp note—resonating through my bones, as if the dream wants to remind me that I am here. That I am listening.

I am walking through a forest made of clock faces. Twisted trunks swirl with gears and hands that spin not in uniformity but in wild, individual rhythms. Some tick forward, some spin backward, some pause entirely like held breaths. I sit beneath one and place my hand against its cool metallic bark. A memory I've never lived floods me: a ship lost beneath glacial waves, chasing constellations that fell into the sea.

I rise, unshaken—more curious than afraid—and follow the sound of wind chimes made of bone.

They lead me to an open field where time folds inward like origami. A great river brews in the center, but it does not flow—it evaporates and recondenses, an eternal cycle looping in place. Towers made of books rise around me, vast and crumbling, the words on the pages shifting when I try to focus. One book flutters open like a startled bird and hovers before me. I place my palm against a page and read with my skin:  

_"The labyrinth is not a place. It is a person."_  

Before me, from the river steam, a figure begins to emerge—a silhouette mirrored five times, each reflection aged differently. One is very young, with eyes locked on the sky. One wears a crown of wilted lilies, weeping gold onto its chest. Another carries a broken violin, it’s strings coiled around the fingers like veins. One stands backward, facing not the present but the past, always. And the final one—veiled in silence—does not move at all. 

I do not move either. I do not speak. We both simply *are.*  

I’ve seen these figures before—not in this dream, but in every one. They appear at the edges: reflections in teacups, silhouettes in curtains, voices whispering through the roots of ancient machines. They are not intrusions. I realize this now. They are me—fractures of thought and time, splintered memories, unseen fears and unseen hopes. Shrines to things I have forgotten I once named.

I kneel not in fear, but reverence.

In the dream, I begin to collect the echoes they cast—each thought a gemstone deep within their shadow. One gives me a memory of climbing a tower made of my own heartbeat to kiss an invisible star. Another shows me a glimpse of a great reckoning where every lie I told myself becomes a bird and leaves my lips in song.

And finally, the silence—the one that never moved—it opens its hand to me.  
Inside, a mirror, polished not with light but regret.

I peer into it.  

I do not see my face.  
I see a thousand versions of myself I never chose. Every road not walked, every word not spoken, every lover not returned to, every wound not kissed.  

I am weeping. I don’t know why.

But the dream does.  

"Creation is the echo of silence you dare give form."

And I wake.  

Heart racing, flesh tingling, mind stained with starlight and questions. The symbols that routinely veil my unconscious are slowly unraveling—timing, echoing, reflective—and I feel not only their meaning but their ministry.  
They are guardians of my unfinished truths.  
Architects of becoming.  
And I—I am their willing wanderer in whatever dreams yet call me.
