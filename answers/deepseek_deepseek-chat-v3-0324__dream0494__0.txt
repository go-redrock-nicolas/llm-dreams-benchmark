I am dreaming. A vast, echoing hallway stretches before me, its walls lined with countless doors, each carved with intricate symbols—knots of silver and gold that shimmer like living threads in the dim, amber light. The air hums with whispered echoes, fragments of laughter, fragments of arguments, half-remembered lullabies. I recognize this place. It is the architecture of my oldest memories, the blueprint of my earliest bonds.  

One door pulses faintly, a slow, warm glow radiating from beneath it. I press my palm to the wood—it’s strangely pliant, like skin. The moment I touch it, the door dissolves into mist, and I am pulled into a room suspended in time.  

The scene is my childhood home, but everything is fluid, shifting—walls breathing in and out like a living thing. A child’s version of myself stands in the center, holding out a tiny hand toward a figure whose face keeps changing—mother, father, a fleeting caretaker, then blurring into someone else entirely. The child’s fingers twitch, unsure. The figure reaches back, but their hand flickers between warmth and absence, solid and ghostly, leaving the child standing there in the quiet agony of not knowing whether to reach again or pull away.  

A whisper curls around my ear: *This is where you learned to love sideways.*  

Suddenly, the floor gives way. I fall through endless layers—into classrooms where I tied myself into knots seeking approval, into bedrooms where I mistook silence for intimacy, into friendships where I repeated the same quiet question: *Am I too much, or not enough?* The scenes bleed faster now, my adult relationships playing out in fractured glimpses—clinging to those who drift, bracing against those who grip too tight, never quite sure where the balance lies.  

Then, a voice—my own, but deeper, older: *You know now. You see the pattern.*  

An orb of liquid gold appears in my palm, pulsing like a heartbeat. It’s heavy with understanding. The moment I wrap my fingers around it, the entire dream collapses inward like a dying star—and for the first time, the weight feels like power, not chains.  

I wake with the knowledge settling into my bones: the past shaped me, but it doesn’t have to name me.
