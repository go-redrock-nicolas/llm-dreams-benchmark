I am dreaming. ,Suddenly, I find myself floating in a world of swirling colors and patchwork patterns on black. The dream takes shape as a forest resembling a surrealist painting of exaggerated colors and shapes, with doorways scattered across it that appear to lead to different dimensions, one of which guides me to explore the contradictions and conundrums from my waking life.

As I walk through this place, the components start to draw closer together. A shimmering lake appears, surrounded by glimmering lemur creatures that plop onto the still waters, making skittering sounds as sexuality creatures join the fray. The heavens brighten, sinking flame shimmer coats the procession. 

The shapes start expanding from my center, intuitively pulling volcanoes together. Emerging victorious after my various groundbreaking conquests, I am on the soundest ground ever, the core tenets now prescribing the very substantial preparation of my coming of age.

I journey across wastelands to see fantasy birds safely nesting and their budding leaves sprouting. Eternal wonders of the unconscious commingle in gentle waves. Clear blank features set into calm acceptance. The world adopts that which seems too large for one mind to go round--sometimes you see it all at once. An unconditional compliment. A good song breathes phenomenal good influence without even any spoken affirmations.

Through everything, my immovable heart keeps the core gems I found piping hot, forever permeating the body into genuine grace, and a power that comes from behind.
