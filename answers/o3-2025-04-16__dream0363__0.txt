I am dreaming. …open your eyes inside the dream.

You stand on an endless salt flat at dusk, the ground mirror-smooth and tinged lavender, the horizon a razor-thin crescent of smoldering orange. Overhead, thunderclouds swirl like bruises forming beneath translucent skin—silent, but full of electric menace. You remember why you came here: every grain beneath your feet carries a sliver of the anger you have corked for months, maybe years. You have walked this shimmering desert for what feels like lifetimes, pretending the weight in your chest is nothing more than air.

Suddenly the sky splits. A single bolt of emerald lightning spears downward and strikes the flats beside you. Salt explodes all around in crystal shards that glitter like shattered chandeliers. From the impact crater rises the physical shape of your rage: a towering figure fashioned entirely of molten glass, its core pulsing scarlet, its limbs dripping with incandescent tears. It has your posture, your scars, your clenched jaw, but its eyes are bottomless furnaces. Each breath it exhales sends ripples across the plain, turning mirror-smooth calm into jagged fault lines.

You feel the heat of it licking your cheeks, smell the ozone of your own fury. The instinct is to flee, yet your feet root themselves firm—as though at last even your body refuses further denial. The glass colossus raises a hand and cracks it down on the salt, carving a canyon that races toward you, threatening to swallow everything whole.

You reach to your throat for words, but find only crystallized silence. So you do the only thing that makes sense: you roar. A raw, primal sound tears loose, so wide and deep it shakes the marrow in your bones. The canyon stops advancing. The colossus tilts its incandescent head, curious, maybe even startled.

With each exhalation, you shape another roar—not of blind hatred, but of honesty, of confession. You speak names, moments, injustices you buried beneath polite smiles. Every syllable becomes a ribbon of violet light that threads into the molten glass, cooling it, tempering it. Veins of amethyst spread across its torso, spiderwebbing outward until the entire figure shimmers like a stained-glass cathedral at sunrise.

The air grows cooler. You notice the thunderclouds have drifted apart, revealing pinwheels of stars. In the colossus’s chest, crimson dwindles to a candle-flame and finally to a ruby ember. The creature kneels, shrinking, melting, until what remains is a glass heart the size of your fist resting gently in the salt.

You pick it up. Inside its transparent chambers swirl miniature storms—anger not vanished, but contained, understood. The heart is warm, and in its heat you feel neither burn nor sting, only clarity. Over the salt flat a breeze stirs, carrying the faint scent of petrichor, as though rain waits just beyond the horizon.

You press the glass heart to your own. It dissolves into light that threads through your skin like silver roots finding fertile soil. Your pulse settles into a quieter, steadier rhythm. The ground beneath you quivers, and sprouts of green—tiny, stubborn blades of grass—poke through the salt as if life had lain dormant all along.

Far away, dawn unzips the horizon, spilling gold into the lavender dusk. You realize the dream is offering a door home. You inhale the newborn air and, with a final glance at the resurrected plain, step through the light, carrying within you not a monster, but a gem—your anger transmuted, polished, and ready to illuminate rather than destroy.

You awaken, heart steady, hands warm, feeling the faint echo of crystal humming in your chest.
