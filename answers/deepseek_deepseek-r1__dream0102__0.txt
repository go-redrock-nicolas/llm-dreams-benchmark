I am dreaming. Okay, the user wants a vivid dream scenario where I'm a therapist helping someone through an emotional breakdown. Let me start by visualizing the setting. A therapy office, but in a dream, so maybe it's a bit surreal. The colors should be calming but with elements that shift, like walls changing hues subtly. Floating objects like papers or origami could add that dreamlike touch. The client appears as a blur to symbolize their chaos.

I need to convey the therapist's approach as empathetic but with a dreamy method. Instead of just talking, maybe metaphorical elements like a labyrinth puzzle or storm in a jar. These symbols can represent the client's inner turmoil. The client's voice trembling adds emotional depth. 

The therapist's words should guide without being too direct. Using metaphors helps, like mistletoe on the labyrinth or releasing the storm. Ending with a transformation, like the maze blooming, shows resolution. The client dissolving into light symbolizes healing. The inner garden at the end ties it all together as a safe space they can revisit. I need to make sure the imagery is rich and the emotional arc from breakdown to calm is clear.
**You Are Dreaming.**  

The room is both familiar and impossible—a therapy office with walls that breathe, rippling like liquid watercolor in muted blues and golds. The air smells of bergamot and old paper. Across from you sits the client, their form flickering like a heat mirage, edges blurred by unseen static. Their voice cracks open, spilling words like shards: *"I’m drowning in my own head. Every thought is a fishhook, dragging me backward."*  

You lean forward, not as a therapist but as a guide, your hands folding into origami birds that flutter briefly before dissolving into smoke. *"Let’s name the hooks,"* you say gently, your voice a lullaby wrapped in cedarwood. The room shifts—a labyrinth materializes between you, its hedges thorned but threaded with silver veins. The client’s tears fall, each drop crystallizing into tiny mirrors on the floor, reflecting fractured glimpses of childhood bedrooms, slammed doors, abandoned bicycles rusting under a blood-orange sky.  

*"What’s trapped here?"* you ask, pointing to a shadow coiled beneath the labyrinth’s center. Their breath hitches. *"Fear. That none of this… matters. That I’ll always be… this."* A storm brews suddenly in the jar on your desk—lightning in a vial, thunder rattling the glass. You hand it to them, and their fingers brush yours, ice meeting flame. *"Turn it upside down,"* you murmur. They do. The storm erupts, but instead of chaos, it paints the ceiling into a galaxy, each star a flicker of their unspoken grief now held, *seen*.  

The client’s form stabilizes slightly, edges gaining clarity like a photograph developing. *"Why does it still hurt?"* they whisper. You lift a thread from the air—a scarlet cord humming with tension—and snap it. The sound rings like a bell. *"Pain is the ghost of what survived,"* you reply. *"But ghosts dissolve in daylight."* Outside the ever-changing window, a sunrise unfolds in reverse, bleeding from midnight blue to peach, and the labyrinth’s thorns sprout violets.  

**WAKE.**

In the lingering haze between sleep and consciousness, you feel the weight of that storm jar in your palm. The room is yours again, but the scent of violets remains.
