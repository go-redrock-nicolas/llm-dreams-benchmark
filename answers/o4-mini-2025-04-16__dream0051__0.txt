I am dreaming. You inhale the thin, electric air of your cockpit—metallic on your tongue, alive with static. The altimeter trembles wildly; red warning lights glimmer like restless fireflies across the dash. Passengers’ voices drift back to you through the intercom, soft and tinny, each syllable a small prayer. You grip the gleaming yoke, whose surface ripples beneath your touch as though it were liquid mercury.

Suddenly, all the gauges stutter into darkness. Engines stutter, coughing up sparks that arc through the fuselage like startled lightning. Outside, the sky is no longer sky but a vast turquoise desert, its dunes shifting in slow motion. Clouds become giant, phosphorescent jellyfish pulsing with violet veins. For an instant, you feel weightless—time dissolving—then the aircraft lunges downward, and you taste vertigo on your tongue.

Your hands fly over controls that morph beneath your fingers. The throttle becomes a slender, singing crystal, humming with untapped power. The compass unfurls like a paper scroll, its arrow pointing toward a distant, floating lighthouse made of stained glass. You realize this world responds to your will: when your heartbeat steadies, the plane’s wings sprout silken feathers; when your focus splinters, the cabin walls ripple like a disturbed pond.

Deep in your mind, you hear the passengers’ collective heartbeat, a low drum that guides you. Trusting it, you reach through the cockpit’s warped horizon and press a sequence of shimmering buttons—and the engines roar back. Turbines roar in phosphorescent blues and greens, illuminating passengers’ surprised faces in an otherworldly glow. Their fingertips press against the windows, watching as the world outside shifts again: the turquoise desert gives way to a forest of towering black orchids, each petal humming with starlight.

With the plane steadying, you realize the runway ahead isn’t concrete but a river of molten silver flowing toward a blood-red sunset. You pilot the craft into its reflective current, tires skimming its surface like a dancer’s toe shoes. Sparks of liquid metal hiss beneath the wheels, sending ripples outward. The aircraft shudders—then glides to a perfect stop, nose aligned with the dying sun-streaked horizon.

Passengers rise in awed silence. Their eyes are galaxies, brimming with gratitude and wonder. You step onto the silver riverbank, the aircraft’s door yawning open like a hungry bird. A warm breeze smells of cinnamon and ozone. You fold the crystalline throttle back into your mind and watch as the plane’s silhouette becomes a constellation in the starlit sky. The passengers disperse, dissolving into flickers of golden light that drift up and vanish among the heavens.

As you stand alone on the mirrored shore, you feel a gentle tug at your consciousness. The dream’s edges blur. In the distance, that lighthouse of stained glass pulses once more—beckoning you onward, deeper into this surreal sky. You close your eyes, ready to answer its silent call, and let yourself fall—back into sleep, back into imagination—knowing you still pilot these wonders even as you drift away.
