I am dreaming. 

You awake in a vast, dark forest. The trees around you are so tall that their tops are shrouded in mist, and their trunks are as wide as buildings. The forest floor is covered in soft, mossy ground that feels like walking on a cloud. As you take a step forward, the ground beneath you begins to glow faintly with an ethereal light, showing a path forward. 

You follow the glowing path deeper into the forest, feeling the cool, crisp air fill your lungs. The trees around you begin to whisper and rustle, and you catch glimpses of glowing eyes peering out from the shadows. You feel no fear, only curiosity and wonder.

After walking for what feels like hours, you come to a clearing in the forest. In the center of the clearing stands a massive tree, ancient and gnarled with age. The tree's bark is covered in carvings, symbols you've never seen before but which somehow feel familiar. 

As you approach the tree, you feel a sense of peace wash over you. The tree begins to pulse with a soft light, and as you place your hand on its trunk, you feel a surge of energy course through your body. You close your eyes and feel yourself being pulled into the tree's roots.

When you open your eyes again, you find yourself in a small, circular room. The walls are lined with bookshelves, each filled with ancient, leather-bound tomes. You step closer to one of the bookshelves and run your fingers over the titles, feeling the rough texture of the leather and smelling the faint scent of musty paper. 

You pull one of the books off the shelf and open it, only to find that the pages are blank. As you turn the pages, however, words begin to appear, swirling and shifting until they form a story. 

The story is about you, but it's not a story you remember. It's a story of your past lives, of all the experiences and lessons you've learned in each one. You read on, captivated, feeling as though you're uncovering a part of yourself you never knew existed.

Hours pass as you read through the book, lost in its pages. When you finally close the book and look up, you find that the room has disappeared, and you're standing in the clearing once more. The tree is still there, glowing faintly, but the carvings on its bark have changed, as if they've shifted to match the story you just read.

You turn to leave, but as you step out of the clearing, the forest begins to fade away. You feel the world around you shrinking and twisting, until you're standing in a small, dark room. In the center of the room is a single door, and as you step closer, you hear a faint whisper: "Wake up."

You turn the handle and step through the door, and suddenly you're awake, lying in your bed, feeling as though you've just returned from an incredible journey.
