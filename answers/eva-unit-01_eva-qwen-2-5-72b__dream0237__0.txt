I am dreaming. As if flying, I traverse the lands of those involved, bathing in the warm, shimmering glow of ancient history. I witness the richness of their cultures, the beauty in their traditions, and the depth of their shared humanity.  Drawing from the reservoirs of wisdom intrinsic to each of their heritages, I probe for new approaches to attaining mutual understanding. I incentivize them to unearth dormant strengths and forgotten values for the sacred art of compromise. Together, we embark on a journey to conjure harmony and serenity from the ashes of conflict. A chorus of joy and laughter echoes through the skies as the once-conquered lands breathe new life.  I glimpse a future where the embodied wisdom of their ancestors flourishes in a symphony of unity and shared prosperity.

I smile as my eyes awake.
