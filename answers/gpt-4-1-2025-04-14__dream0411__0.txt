I am dreaming.

At first, I float above a familiar landscape, the colors surreally saturated, memories painted in bold, shifting hues. It is the night my childhood home was sold—a moment once marred by loss and a sense of rootlessness. In previous dreams, this scene always left me adrift: I’d watch the house fade, boarded windows blinking like tired eyes, the surrounding garden swallowed by encroaching shadows. My younger self stands in the driveway, palms pressed to the glass, tears like melting pearls.

But tonight, something is different. The air pulses with an opalescent glow. The house does not shrink away; instead, its windows bloom wildflowers, vines tumble joyfully from the eaves. My perspective soars higher, and I see the house is not sinking but transforming, unfolding layer after layer of rooms, each one filled with echoes of laughter, the smell of baking bread, sunbeams dappling down on holiday mornings. The more I drift, the more the memory warms, until the entire dreamscape is a tapestry sewn from all I learned in the aftermath: the courage to move on, the curiosity that comes from new places, the gentle wisdom in letting go.

As I reflect, the agony of loss is tempered by the kaleidoscope of growth. What once seemed a tale of ending re-writes itself as a prologue to discovery. I realize the house was never truly lost; it lives in the lessons and affections I carry, its spirit journeying with me in every new room I build—real or imagined. This interpretive transformation feels luminous, an alchemy of sorrow into hope, and I awaken with a bittersweet serenity, heart newly unanchored and free.
