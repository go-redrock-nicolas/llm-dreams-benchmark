I am dreaming. You drift into a boundless twilight, where the air ripples like silk and every breath tastes of starlight. You stand on a glassy plain of liquid moonlight that ripples under your feet, each step sending concentric rings of pale glow toward a distant horizon. Above you, the sky is alive with kaleidoscopic auroras—ribbons of emerald, rose, and violet that pulse gently, as though breathing in time with your heartbeat.  

At the edge of your vision a figure emerges. It’s neither wholly human nor animal but something in between—a tall, slender being with skin that shimmers like oil on water and eyes as deep and knowing as the cosmos. Their hair drifts upward in a silent current, as though suspended underwater, and in their presence an uncanny warmth blooms in your chest. You realize: this unexpected companion is an embodiment of a part of you you’ve never met before.  

They reach out a hand. When your fingers touch, a cascade of memories and feelings you once pushed aside washes through you—childhood laughter you buried to seem serious, a wild yearning to create music you called frivolous, tears you held back to appear strong. Each spark of insight blossoms into color in the air: a bright crimson swirl for passion, a soft aquamarine for compassion, a golden shower of sparks for courage.  

As you gaze into their luminous eyes, they whisper truths you’ve never dared admit: that your heart has always sought more than safety, that the shadows you feared contain the seeds of your greatest strengths. A melody rises from the world itself—a haunting, wordless song that seems to originate in your own throat. You realize you know every note, every inflection, every hidden lament and triumph threaded through its chords.  

Together you walk across the glass plain toward a vast, ancient tree whose roots writhe like serpents of silver. Its trunk is carved with symbols you can almost decipher: runes of transformation, spirals of becoming, and beneath them a single word in your own handwriting—“Becoming.” The dream-being lays a hand on the trunk, and the bark parts like a curtain to reveal a hollow heart where your own silhouette stands.  

Inside that shadowed cavity you see yourself as you truly are: both brilliant and fragile, a tapestry of light and shade woven together. No longer do you judge the dark threads as flaws—they are vital threads of resilience and depth. The being smiles, and you feel that smile resonate inside your chest. You step forward and merge with your silhouette, feeling bones realign, shoulders broaden, a surge of newfound potency filling every fiber of your being.  

Up above, the auroras flare into one magnificent pillar of white fire. It descends, encircling you as you—now whole—rise from the heart of the tree. Your arms unfurl into wings of living light. In that exhilarating moment, you know you carry within you the forgotten bravery of childhood, the fierce compassion of your empathic heart, and the unquenchable curiosity of your spirit.  

As you ascend into the shimmer of dawn, the dream-being fades into stardust at your feet, their final gift a whisper on the wind: “You are the dream you sought.” You awaken, but the echo of luminous wings still hums beneath your skin—and you carry the revelation of your own becoming into the new day.
