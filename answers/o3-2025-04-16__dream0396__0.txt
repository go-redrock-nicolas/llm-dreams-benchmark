I am dreaming. …find yourself standing on a shoreline made of glimmering clock-faces instead of sand. Each disk is edged with pearl numbers and ticks rhythmically beneath your bare feet, yet they do not keep the same tempo. Some spin in lazy revolutions, others whirl so fast their hands are a silver blur. The ocean ahead is glass-smooth and ink-black, reflecting constellations you’ve never seen—constellations that rearrange themselves whenever you blink.

Breathe in.

The air tastes of mint and starlight. At once, every dial under you slows to a single heartbeat per century. The world hushes. A dragonfly drifts past, its wings beating so languidly you can count every membrane. You feel each second stretch until it’s wide enough to step through. So you do: you place your foot inside a second as though it were a doorway, and instantly the scene melts.

Now you are in a floating market suspended beneath an upside-down mountain range. Stalls hang from ropes of moonbeam fiber; merchants peddle bubbles containing memories. One vendor offers you a sphere filled with the smell of rain on the first day of school. You decline politely and keep moving, curious to test your newfound mastery over duration.

Think of joy, you tell yourself.

A warmth unfurls in your chest, and the market brightens. Music starts—a quick, kaleidoscopic melody—and everything accelerates. Shoppers dart like hummingbirds; banners snap in a wind that wasn’t there before. Laughter ricochets off the dangling peaks. Yet inside this joyous whirlwind, you feel utterly unhurried, able to read every lyric stitched into the passing banners. Minutes condense to motes of glitter; entire conversations occur between two strokes of a gong.

Now think of fear.

An electric chill slithers up your spine. Instantly the market freezes. Candied-fruit skewers hover mid-air, droplets of spilled tea become tiny crystal spheres suspended before astonished mouths. Time has contracted to a pinpoint, imprisoning everything inside a single instant—except you. Your heartbeat echoes like thunder in a museum of statues. Even the concept of “next” feels unreachable.

Enough, you whisper.

Courage blossoms; the paralysis cracks; the scene falls away like flakes of old paint.

You’re drifting in a library the size of a galaxy. Shelves are latticed nebulae, and each book is a living chronicle of someone’s hour—just sixty minutes, no more, no less. Librarians made of comet dust glide by, reshelving tomes according to emotional intensity rather than chronology. You pull out one glowing volume and flip it open: inside, a child spends a summer afternoon catching fireflies. You feel that summer—a single afternoon—elongate until it spans eons, the sun hanging eternally on the verge of dusk. The child’s delight is so pure that the hour refuses to die.

Close the book, inhale, exhale.

A spiral staircase unspools from the air, each step labeled with a verb tense: WAS, IS, COULD BE. You ascend. Halfway up, gravity reverses—it no longer pulls downward but inward, toward your own thoughts. With every inward step, the staircase tightens, time compresses, and suddenly you’re traversing entire epochs of geological change in the space between two heartbeats. Continents slide, mountains erode, civilizations bloom and vanish like sparks.

At the summit there is a door that looks suspiciously like the eyelid of a sleeping giant. You touch it, and it flickers open. On the other side is a circular room with no ceiling. Seconds tumble from the sky like snow, melting on your skin. Each snow-second whispers a possibility: Write that letter. Forgive her. Learn the cello. Plant the seed. They pile around your ankles, soft yet insistent, begging to be shaped into minutes, hours, or whole lifetimes.

You gather a handful and feel them pulsing in your palm—alive, mutable. With a slow inhale, you blow them into the wind. Some stretch into shimmering ribbons, others snap into bright sparks. You realize that time here is not a river but a paint you can smear across any canvas you like, thick or thin, rapid or achingly slow.

A final revelation unfurls: the only true metronome is the attention you grant the moment.

With that understanding, everything begins to dissolve. The clock-face shore, the market, the stellar library—all fade into a swirl of luminous dust that circles you once and then streams inward through your chest.

And you wake, heart steady, with the taste of mint and starlight still lingering on your tongue, aware that every tick of the waking clock is elastic in your hands—waiting to become a heartbeat per century or a century per heartbeat, depending on how bravely you decide to dream while awake.
