I am dreaming. You’re standing in a vast, sterile operating theater that stretches beyond logic—a cathedral of medicine with vaulted ceilings of polished bone and chandeliers made of suspended glass neurons, each filament glowing with electric blue light. The air hums with the low, resonant frequency of a thousand heartbeats, and the scent of antiseptic is laced with something stranger: burnt sugar, ozone, and the metallic tang of fear. The patient lies on a table carved from a single block of obsidian, their head haloed by a ring of floating, holographic screens that flicker with fractal patterns and indecipherable equations. Their face is familiar—*too* familiar. It’s your own face, or someone you’ve loved and lost, their features slack and pale, eyes closed as if trapped in a nightmare you’re meant to unravel.  

Your hands tremble, not just from the weight of the scalpel—a blade forged from starlight and shadow, its edge so sharp it seems to *unstitch* reality—but from the knowledge that every synapse in this body is a thread in a cosmic tapestry. You weren’t trained for this. You’ve never held a scalpel before. But the surgeons around you—faceless figures in gowns stitched with constellations—whisper in unison: *“You know what to do. You’ve always known.”*  

The scalpel bites into the scalp, and the sound is wrong, *alien*: a wet crunch, like breaking through ice to reach a sea of liquid light. Blood doesn’t spill. Instead, a mist rises, swirling with fragments of memory—a child’s laughter, a shattered mirror, a train plunging into a tunnel of stars. The skull peels away like an eggshell, revealing a brain that pulses like a living nebula, its folds and creases glowing with the colors of forgotten dreams. Veins snake like bioluminescent rivers, and you realize, with a jolt of terror, that this organ isn’t just a mass of tissue. It’s a map. A labyrinth. A door.  

You hesitate. The surgeons hiss. The patient’s double begins to convulse, their doppelgänger’s mouth stretching into a silent scream as cracks spiderweb across their face. You fumble for tools that morph in your hands—a retractor becomes a pair of antlers, a suction device transforms into a hollowed hummingbird skull—and the monitors erupt into chaotic static, screeching in a language that feels like it’s carving runes into your skull.  

Then, a voice cuts through the chaos. Your own voice, but deeper, older, resonant with a knowing that isn’t yours. *“Trust the rhythm.”*  

You close your eyes. The world narrows to the thrum of the brain’s pulsations, the way its light swells and fades like a tide. You move—not with skill, but with instinct, as if your hands are guided by the hands of every healer, every storyteller, every desperate soul who’s ever tried to mend what was broken. The scalpel dances, tracing sigils in the air, severing tendrils of shadow that coil like serpents around the hippocampus. You press your palm to the cortex, and suddenly you’re *inside*—racing through corridors of memory, dodging shards of trauma, stitching synapses with threads of moonlight.  

The patient’s body arches. The surgeons vanish. The room dissolves into a void where only the brain remains, now blazing like a newborn star. You plunge your hands into its light, and—  

—*you wake up, gasping, your skin slick with sweat, the echo of a heartbeat still thrashing in your ears. Somewhere, deep in your bones, you swear you’ve left a piece of yourself behind in that operating theater, trapped between the folds of a mind you barely understood.*
