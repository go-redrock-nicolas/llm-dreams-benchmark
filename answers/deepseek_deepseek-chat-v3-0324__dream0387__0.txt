I am dreaming. The air is thick with golden light, the kind that seems to hum, vibrating at the edge of hearing. I stand in an opulent hall of mirrors—no, not mirrors, but gilded portraits, each framed in ornate carvings of vines and serpents. And every portrait is of *me*.  

My many reflections are glorious. In one, I am bathed in celestial radiance, a halo of fire wreathing my head. In another, I stand atop a mountain of treasures, the envy of kings. A third shows me at the center of an adoring crowd, their faces upturned like flowers to the sun. I smile. This is the truth, isn’t it? The world sees me as I am—brilliant, unmatched, singular.  

But then I hear the murmurs.  

At first, they are soft—whispers slipping between the frames like cold drafts. Then louder, sharper.  

*"Do you see how they preen?"*  
*"As if they’re the only star in the sky."*  
*"No one else matters to them, do they?"*  

I whirl around, but the voices come from everywhere, echoing off the polished marble floors. The portraits—*my* portraits—are changing. The crowd that once adored me now turns away, their eyes rolling, unimpressed. The halo sputters like a dying candle. The treasures at my feet crumble to dust.  

A door materializes before me, black iron etched with the words: **"Step through and see what they see."**  

I hesitate. My pulse thrums in my throat. But the voices grow louder, more insistent, until they’re unbearable, a chorus of disappointment. I wrench the door open—  

—And I am standing in a room I don’t recognize. A dinner table, crowded with people who once called me a friend. They laugh, talk, pass dishes between them. No one glances at the empty seat where *I* should be. And then, as if my presence has finally registered, a few turn their heads. Their expressions flicker—not with awe, not with admiration, but something worse.  

*Pity.*  

One of them sighs. *"They always made everything about themselves, didn’t they?"*  

The floor drops beneath me. I fall through endless dark, the weight of their words pressing down like stones in my chest.  

And then—I wake.  

The room is silent. My own breath sounds too loud. My hands grip the sheets, slick with sweat.  

For the first time, I wonder: *If the world doesn't see what I see... whose vision is the lie?*
