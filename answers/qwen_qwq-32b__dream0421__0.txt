I am dreaming. I am in a vast, open field filled with wildflowers swaying in the breeze. Above me is a sky that’s split into two halves—one side is a vivid sunset orange and the other a deep midnight blue, the horizon where they meet glowing like molten gold. I walk forward and notice the ground shifts beneath my feet, turning to soft, glowing sand as I pass. There's a path of floating islands ahead, each one unique: one is covered in crystalline trees that chime in the wind, another has a lake of liquid starlight. I decide to step onto the first island. As I touch a crystal tree, it begins to play a melody that feels familiar yet otherworldly. The sound seems to awaken memories I didn’t know I had—scenes of ancient cities made of light and shadow, creatures with iridescent wings soaring overhead. Suddenly, the ground trembles; the islands start to rotate like gears in some immense machine. A voice, neither male nor female, speaks to me in thoughts rather than words: \"Choose your path wisely. Each island holds a different truth.\" I float toward the next island, where the starlight lake reflects not my face, but a version of myself from another life, laughing in a crowd under a sky.
