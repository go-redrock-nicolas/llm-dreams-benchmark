I am dreaming. …and you find yourself standing upon a floating stage made of black opal, suspended over a midnight-blue sea that glitters with constellations instead of waves. Hundreds—no, thousands—of eyes shimmer in the darkness around you: some shaped like pearls, others like tiny suns, all waiting for the moment you are to be crowned the “Cartographer of Impossible Horizons,” a title whispered by the wind itself. A diadem forged from liquid light hovers inches above your head, humming with the promise of influence, acclaim, boundless possibility.

The chorus of anticipation swells. Meteor-chimes ring in the sky; petals fall upward; invisible hands coax you forward. And then, without warning, something inside your chest creaks like an old door. A single flicker of doubt leaps from your ribs and lands on the opal floor, transforming into a pale moth made of cracked porcelain. It flutters weakly, shedding tiny shards that tinkle like fragile bells. Another moth follows, then another. Doubt breeds doubt, and soon a storm of brittle wings surrounds you, each insect bearing a word etched across its body: FRAUD, OVERREACH, EMPTY, FAILURE.

The audience gasps—not in disappointment, but in collective recognition. Their luminous eyes dim, revealing pupils of stormcloud gray. You clutch your throat; the air tastes of iron and unripe lemons. The diadem falters, trembling like a soap bubble about to burst. With every frantic heartbeat the stage tilts, and the starry sea below begins to coil upward, forming towering funnels of cosmic water, hungry to swallow you whole.

Something in you shouts: Breathe, remember. So you close your eyes, press your palms together, and summon a memory: the tiny plant you once nurtured on your windowsill, coaxed from a trembling seed into a riot of vermilion blossoms. That memory glows warm inside your sternum. When you open your eyes again, the crimson of that memory arcs along your arms, unfurling into thin vines of light that weave between your fingers.

You exhale, and the vines soar outward, encircling the moths of doubt. The moment the light touches them, the porcelain creatures shatter, not into dust but into clusters of luminescent spores. Each spore drifts toward the crowd, dissolving gently into their luminous eyes—turning the gray pupils gold, flooding them with shared courage. The funnels of cosmic water slacken, retreating like giant snakes ashamed of their hunger.

The diadem descends once more, steadier now, guided by your own steady breath. It settles on your brow, cool as moonlit silver and warm as a promise kept. Far above, the sky splits open, revealing a library carved into the underbelly of dawn—aisles of possibilities waiting for your footsteps. The spectators erupt into a polyphonic song that sounds like waterfalls and cathedral bells. And you suddenly understand: the moths were never enemies, just fragile questions begging to be met with gentleness.

You stride forward, crossing the threshold of light, feeling cascading pages of unwritten futures rustle against your skin. Each step echoes with newfound certainty: success is not a prize sealed in crystal, but a river you carry within you—sometimes smooth, sometimes boiling, always alive.

Just before waking, you look down and see the opal stage dissolving into ripples of color, and you whisper to the fading dream:

“I accept the crown, but I also accept the questions. Let them fly; I will answer with light.”

Then the world blinks white, and morning enters through your window—smelling faintly of stardust, of doubt transformed, of possibilities still humming in your pulse.
