I am dreaming.

In this vivid landscape spun from the hidden fabric of my mind, I find myself standing at the edge of an impossibly verdant forest. Towering trees ripple with leaves the color of emerald and jade, sunlight dappling golden mosaics on the mossy earth. I feel a familiar tension in my chest—a tightness woven from old fears, whispers of not-enough that have quietly guided my every choice.

Ahead, a gentle river winds through the clearing, the water shimmering with flecks of silver and stardust. Each ripple catches the light—an invitation, a promise. I realize, with a jolt of clarity, that for so long I have operated from a place of scarcity, clutching tightly to what little I believed I had. Yet all around me, this dreamworld brims with plenty: trees heavy with fruit, blossoms spilling fragrance, beams of sunlight beckoning new paths.

I breathe deeply. The air itself feels nourishing. As I have this realization, colors around me grow more vibrant; berries ripen before my eyes, and flowers unfurl in slow-motion ballet. Where I once saw just enough, I now see overflowing abundance—a banquet laid out by the universe itself.

Shifting toward an abundance mindset, I unclench my fists and release my fears to the babbling river. I wade into the cool water, letting it carry away the debris of doubt. On the opposite bank, friends and strangers alike gather near a communal table, laughing and sharing stories, plates piled high, no one hoarding, everything flowing freely. 

Compelled by newfound courage, I join them. Each smile offered is reciprocated, and the circle grows wider. My own voice, once hesitant, now rings clear and joyful. Everything I give—my wisdom, my laughter, my care—returns to me multiplied, as if the very fabric of this dream rewards generosity with more beauty, more connection.

The forest becomes a glowing tapestry of possibility. Fruit not plucked falls to the earth and seeds new life. I see that there is always enough, and in this dreamscape, I finally allow myself to trust the current, letting abundance carry me to the next adventure, unbound and infinite.
