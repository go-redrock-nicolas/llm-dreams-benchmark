I am dreaming. In this dream, I'm caught in a vast, dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and earth. The ground crunches beneath my feet as I weave through towering trees, their leaves whispering secrets in the wind. I feel a sense of urgency pulsing through me, like the steady beat of a drum growing louder with each step. 

Suddenly, I hear it: a faint crackling sound off in the distance. It grows louder, echoing through the trees like an approaching storm. The smell of smoke fills my nose, stronger with every breath. I look up, and streaks of orange and red dance across the sky, flames licking the treetops as if reaching for the heavens. 

Panic grips me, but there's no clear path to safety. The fire surrounds me, closing in on all sides. I feel the heat on my back, the air becoming harder to breathe. I glance around, desperate for an escape route. There, in the distance, I see a small opening between two massive oaks. It's my only chance.

I run towards it, my heart pounding like thunder in my chest. As I reach the clearing, I see a rushing river just beyond the trees. It's my lifeline. I sprint faster, my legs burning with each step, pushing myself to the limit. The flames roar behind me, hot on my heels.

Just as I reach the river's edge, the heat becomes unbearable. I leap into the water, the cool rush of it like a balm on my burning skin. I swim with everything I have, the flames snapping at the surface of the water as I make my escape. 

As I emerge on the other side, panting and gasping for air, the forest behind me is a wall of fire. The flames rise high into the night sky, casting eerie shadows on the water. I am alive, but only just. The forest, my sanctuary, is now a blazing inferno.

And then, as suddenly as it began, the fire subsides. The smoke clears, and the charred remnants of the forest stand like silent sentinels around me. The ground beneath my feet is cool, the air fresh once more. I take a deep breath, the smell of ash and burnt wood filling my lungs, and I begin the long walk home.

My heart slows to a steady beat, and I know that I have survived. But as I look back at the destruction, I can't help but wonder: what will the forest look like when I return?
