I am dreaming. The hospital where I work is not just a building of steel and stone, but a living, breathing organism. The walls pulse with every patient’s heartbeat, the fluorescent lights flicker like dying stars. The emergency department? It’s a roaring beast—a maelstrom of pain and panic.  Let me paint you this nightmare:  
A silent alarm wails in the middle of the night, blood samples spilling over like crimson rain. The OR lights turn green, not white, and the surgical instruments float midair. A patient arrives without skin—a translucent outline of agony—demanding answers. I can’t speak, words are smoke in my throat. Nurses materialize, faces blurred, doing CPR with invisible hands. Critical stats flash across the walls in hieroglyphs—80/50 BP, 8 sats, 9 Be< continue |>
The dream begins not with a hospital, but with a *starving labyrinth* of corridors, its walls made of fingers still clutching the last breaths of 100,000 forgotten emergencies. The air smells of ozone and regret, thick enough to choke. Here’s how it unfolds:  

The first anomaly is the **ceiling**. It peels upward, bleeding condensation that forms words in Braille: *"EXPIRED 1983"*—a date long before the gray floors beneath were even poured. Ventilator tubing writhes like neon serpents, their hoses splitting to wrap around ventilators, suffocating them. A child arrives, her fractures not in bone but in *time*: one eye sees 1918 (pneumonia’s ghostly grip), the other 2045 (a respirator shaped like a birdcage). When I try to stabilize her, my gloves dissolve, leaving my hands raw and *pulsating with someone else’s DNA*.  

Next, **resources rebel**. IV bags drip not saline, but liquid silver that burns holes into IV poles. Syringes retract, sharpening into needles too thin to hold liquid—*or soul*. The pharmacy’s inventory? A *parlor trick*: three expired epinephrine vials that shift labels depending on who lifts them—one moment “2023,” the next “1969,” their plunger hissing, *”You think time is linear?”* Oxygen tanks, when opened, spew not air but *black fog* that drowns instead of heals, seeping into lungs with the sound of a suitcase zipping shut.  

Worse comes the **staff**. The night nurse, Lisa, morphs mid-shift—her jaw unhinging into a hinge-like structure, her head tilting 180 degrees to whisper, *”We’re all just Frankensteins here—prioritize the donor.”* Two paramedics are now *depthless*, their torsos hollow, chest cavities full of flickering screens looping viral footage of *yesterday’s* codes. They drag in patients by their ankles, chanting, *”Justice delayed… death salved.”*  

The **operating rooms** become ethical labyrinths. In Theater 1, a surgeon’s scalpel *quivers*, demanding I dissect a man’s *spleen* before it bursts with unregulated compassion. When I refuse, the lights dim, and the man’s spleen *explodes*, drenching the table in fluid that crystallizes into wedding rings. In Theater 2, I must amputate not a limb, but *a patient’s concept of fear*—a translucent, pulsing mass that howls *”I need you to be afraid to keep me alive.”*  

By dawn, the **hospital begins to digest itself**. The cafeteria’s fryer belches liquid nitrogen that freezes a trauma bay into glass. The CT scanner now cycles through *patient proposals*—”Would you recommend glioblastoma treatment?”—before revealing tumors shaped like question marks. The morgue growsl. When I open it, the drawers slide open without handles, releasing a fog that smells of *salt and lemon pledge*, the dead’s phantoms humming, *”We’re still here, we’re still here…”*  

The climax hits when the **code alarm mutates**. It’s no longer a beeping siren, but a *voice*—a chorus of patients from every era,  voices layering like a phonograph skipping: *”Triage is a lie. Triage is a lullaby. We are all-code blues.”* The doors slam shut, welding themselves into a pyramid. The EKGs synchronize, each one spiking in **Fibonacci rhythm**, spelling out in EKG blips: *”28.4% survival rate. Would you like a receipt?”*  

I wake with static in my veins, knowing that the dream isn’t over. Somewhere, *always somewhere*, the hospital whispers through my teeth, *”Prioritize the pulse. Prioritize the myth.”* And I fear the day I start agreeing.
