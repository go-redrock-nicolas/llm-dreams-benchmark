I am dreaming. Or at least—consciousness tells me I am, floating soft as ash above my own bones. Somewhere beneath me lies the brittle crust of the waking world, distant and unknowable. But here, in this vast cathedral of the night, time is molten. Fragments of memory move like drifting embers, falling soundlessly into the vast hollow of what remains.

I stand amid the ruins.

They are not just ruins of earth or mortar, though trees are broken like spilled matchsticks and the sky is still gray with the ghosts of dust given life. This was no mere quake, nor a fire carried by the wind. This was Exile—named and unnameable—creeping in beneath surreal clouds, siphoning the beauty from the world. Here, the flora looks twisted by grief: blackened flowers curl inward like fists, and stones weep sap instead of rain.

I walk barefoot, skin peeling with every step, but there is no pain—only the discomfort of remembering what pain once felt like. Everything here is memory: my house exists not as a ruin but as a feeling—a knot behind my ribs, a draft beneath the door of the dream. The porch is gone, yet I see my dog curled there, waiting, still, as he did when he was alive and waiting never killed him.

My family—nameless in this dream where all names dissolve into smoke—vanish when I try to reach them. Their footprints remain in the ash. A shoe here, a ribbon there. I follow them, but they lead nowhere. I glance behind me and see they’re following me.

I pass silent pools of water that reflect no one. Once a lake that hummed lullabies, now it sleeps, choked with lost photographs. I hear whispers, not of voices, but of *absences*. The wind rustles bones in the trees. Not birdsong: bone-song.

A tree ahead—a relic—it’s hunched like an old god and draped with what might once have been curtains from my room, now riddled by moths who sing in harmonies slightly out of tune with the world. Its roots snake like veins into my shadow. My own heartbeat mirrors the hollow drum of the soil. I touch the bark. It recognizes me before I remember it.

Then—a flicker.

The world *shimmers*, like film pulled too tight over a projector. A bird of phantom feathers lands near me, voice like broken glass and forgotten laughter.

“Begin again,” it says without words.

And I look past the skeletons of everything I knew and *see*—not what was destroyed, but what is ready to crawl from the wreckage like a newborn. Beneath the debris, soft green shoots fluoresce faintly. Pulsing. Breathing.

This world of ruin was never about loss.

It was preparation.

And here, in this wild permutation of sorrow and rebirth, a new dream flickers awake—tentacle-like vines curling around the edges of my thoughts, whispering of cities that will rise not from the ashes, but *from me*.
