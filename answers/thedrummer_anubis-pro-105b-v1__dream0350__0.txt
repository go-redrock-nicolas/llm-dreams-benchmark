I am dreaming. I am dreaming softly. I step into my dream.

I stand, marveling at such wondrous and endless skies. Aged, scaled, tinted in a myriad of molten colors. They carry an immortal quality. The sky is infinite space woven with stellar rhythms and eternal movement.

My dream begins like a lovelorn flower, tentative and delicate. It unfurls in eloquent whimsy and luminescent paint-splattered fancies. I imagine myself in a material tour de force befitting this momentous occasion, this flow of pure imagination. Immersed, I withstand heart and soul the dizzying issuance of flushed dawns, lustrous prismatic hues, joyful nebulas that pulse miles by mist upholstered miles as secrets spill away from us to the universe.

I am fluid. I am and become. In this dream within my dream, illogicality is a ladder form whose rightful balloon interior I soar both internally and eternally while the cavernous stalactite animalities glimmer betwixt my peripheral as hidden highwaymen laden with theoretical converses and happiness interlinks engineered nowhere else but the globe reflowing my connexion.

I become one in this dream cosmos. Knowledge jumps from stories to my mind. Considered and curious compeon logical scars makes the amazing mystery come true. :)
