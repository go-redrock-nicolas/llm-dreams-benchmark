I am dreaming. As consciousness dissolves into dreamscape, I find myself standing in the charred ruins of what was once a magnificent glass tower—my life's work, my architectural masterpiece. The structure that had once pierced the clouds now lies in fragments around me, each shard reflecting distorted pieces of my face. Rain falls softly, turning ash to mud beneath my feet.

Behind me stretches a timeline of devastations: the plagiarism accusations that nearly destroyed my reputation five years ago; the collapse of the bridge in São Paulo that many blamed on my experimental design; the investors who abandoned me after the Tokyo project bankruptcy. Each disaster somehow survived, each recovery more improbable than the last.

But this—this smoking crater before me—feels different. Final. Insurmountable.

The air smells of ozone and failure. My phone hasn't stopped vibrating with calls from journalists, former colleagues, and lawyers. Social media has already convicted me. The structural failure killed no one, thank whatever gods may be, but my name has become synonymous with professional negligence overnight.

As I stand there, something unexpected happens. From the rubble, a small green shoot emerges, pushing through the destruction with impossible persistence. It grows before my eyes, not with natural slowness but with dream-logic rapidity, unfurling leaves and stretching upward.

I kneel to touch it, and the moment my fingers make contact, the plant erupts into a spiraling organic structure—part building, part living entity—that incorporates the very debris of my failure into something entirely new. I see equations flowing like sap through transparent stems, problems solving themselves in the arithmetic of nature.

The answer was always here, in the ruins, waiting to be discovered...

I awaken with the solution fully formed in my mind, understanding now that destruction isn't the end—it's simply material for what comes next.
