I am dreaming. In the dream, I find myself sitting in front of a computer, the screen an endless stretch of readable characters - 1's and 0's stretching up and down, going on forever. This is it, the Gnarium cryptogram, a puzzle that has confounded the greatest minds for decades, possibly longer. Emotions swell up inside me. I almost can't believe it. I'm dreaming the cryptogram.
