I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of burning lavender, and the world around me is a kaleidoscope of fractured glass. Each shard holds a memory—a moment I chose to swallow my own needs to keep the peace. The glass whispers in a hundred voices, all mine, all accusing.

The path I walk is paved with mirrors.  Each step reflects a different version of me: the one who skipped lunch to cook dinner for someone who never reciprocated, the one who canceled her own plans to drive two hours each weekend to visit someone who blew her off, the one who laughed too loud at jokes she found bitter, just to make someone else feel seen.  The mirrors crack as I move, but I keep walking, because the alternative is the void behind me—the hollow place where my identity used to live.

Then, in the distance, a tree begins to grow.  It's not like any tree I've seen.  Its trunk is woven from telephone wires that hum with old, unresolved conversations.  The branches twist into question marks that droop like wilted flowers.  When I reach out to touch it, the bark peels back to reveal a screen.  On it, I see myself as others see me—small,pliant, a blur of colors that don't quite match.  I touch the screen, and suddenly, the colors burst, pixelating into a collage of my own choosing: a painting I abandoned because "he didn't like it," the novel chapters I deleted, the pottery wheel I gave away.  Each pixel is a choice I didn't make until now.

The tree starts to shake.  Its leaves fall like confetti, each one a "sorry" or a "just let me" I've ever uttered.  The confetti floats upward, forming a staircase.  I climb, and as I do, the world around me shifts.  The air smells like rain and mother's milk and freshly ground coffee.  The glass shards on the ground turn into stepping stones, each one etched with a different "I want."  I step onto the first one: "I want to eat alone without guilt."  The stone sparkles under my foot.  The next: "I want to cancel plans without feeling selfish."  This one glows.  The last stone reads: "I want to burn the tree."  I touch it, and— 

The tree disintegrates into a shower of fireflies.  They swarm me, carrying away the last of the fractured reflections.  I wake up, tangled in a sheet that smells like lavender and coffee, my hands still glowing.  The dream lingers like a song in my head, its melody the quiet roar of a thousand "I wants" that have been waiting to be heard.
In the heart of your dream, you stand in a labyrinth of mirrors, each one a prison cell for a version of yourself you've outgrown. The air hums with the static of unresolved dialogue—words left unsaid, compromises unmade. At the center of this maze, a clock ticks backward, its gears clogged with thorns that stab at your ankles. Every step you take to reach it feels like swimming upstream, the walls closing in with each choice you defer.

You finally grasp the clock's hands, but instead of rewinding time, they crumble into dust. What falls from the cracks isn't sand—it's seeds. They sprout into a wilted rose, its petals stained with regret. As you touch it, the rose blooms violently, thorns morphing into letters spelling out your name. Each petal whispers fragmented memories: the time you stayed up all night listening to someone's problems while ignoring your own deadlines, the moment you let a friend borrow your favorite jacket and never saw it again, the day you shrugged off a promotion to make sure everyone else felt included.

The rose begins to grow taller, its stem twisting into a staircase that reaches toward a constellation you recognize—a cluster of stars you once drew in a notebook during a boring lecture. You climb, each step etched with a "should" you've carried. At the top, the constellation blinks into a bridge, its planks made of all the doors you've left cracked open—opportunities, hobbies, friendships that fizzled because you didn't fight to keep them alive.

You cross, and on the other side, the world is painted in watercolor shades of possibility. A river divides it, its currents a mix of tears and champagne. You kneel beside it, and from your pocket, you pull out all the things you've sacrificed—keys to a life you never lived, a faded ticket stub for a concert you promised yourself you'd go to, a lock of hair you saved from someone who left without goodbye. You toss them in, and the river surges, turning into a storm that sweeps away the labyrinth behind you.

When you wake, your hands are damp with real rain, not the manufactured kind. The dream clings to you like a second skin, its seams unraveling with each sunrise, reminding you that the deepest parts of you aren't meant to be harmony-keepers—they're meant to be wild, untamed, and unapologetically yours.
