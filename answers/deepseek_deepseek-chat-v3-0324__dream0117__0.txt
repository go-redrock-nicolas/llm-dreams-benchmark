I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and ozone, clinging to the back of my throat as I push through the crowded marketplace. The sky above is a swirl of bruised purples and sickly yellows, shifting like oil on water, though no one else seems to notice. My fingers tremble around the crumpled note in my palm—burned at the edges, written in a hand that isn’t quite mine—but the words are undeniable:  

*One hour. Then, the sky splits.*  

I lurch toward the nearest person, a vendor selling glistening black fruit that drips syrup like tar. "Listen to me," I say, my voice steady despite the drumming in my chest. "Something is coming. Something terrible. We have to move—we have to leave *now*." His face twists in amusement, then pity. "The heat’s gotten to you, friend," he chuckles, pushing a fruit into my hands like a consolation prize. The juice coats my fingers, sticky and warm as blood.  

I turn to others—a woman humming, a child spinning in circles, a pair of lovers whispering under the weight of a dying sun. Their refusal is quiet, dismissive. A few laugh. One tells me to rest. My reflection in a shattered mirror shows my eyes too wide, my lips moving soundlessly. The clock above the town square groans as its rusted hands lurch forward. *Fifty minutes left.*  

A whisper curls around me, like wind through dead grass: *"They never believe until it's too late."* I don’t see who speaks—only shadows stretching too long, too thin. The ground beneath me hums, vibrating with something ancient, something waking. The cobblestones shift like loose teeth.  

I run now, knocking over carts, shouting. My voice is raw, but the crowd blurs—not in fear, but indifference. Their faces melt at the edges, features bleeding like wax. The clock strikes the half-hour, each toll ringing in my bones.  

Then—silence. The wind dies. Even my breath feels stolen. Above, the sky darkens, not with clouds, but with *absence*. A rift peels open: a jagged maw of starless black. The edges pulse, breathing. Screams rise, too late. The ground splits, and for a moment, I see *something* moving in the depths—great, shuddering shapes, vast and hungry.  

The last thing I hear is the clock chiming, just once, as the sky swallows the world whole.  

Then—I wake.
