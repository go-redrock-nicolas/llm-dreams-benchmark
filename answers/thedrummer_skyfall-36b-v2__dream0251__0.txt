I am dreaming. as the anxiety balloons, my dream world shifts and distorts, reflecting the turmoil within my mind. The once familiar conference room morphed into a vast, echoing chamber. The faces of the audience connecting across the space, their eyes boring into mine, appraising, judging. Their features moonlight into grotesque masks - half man, half beast, twisted in sinister grins and mocking scowls.

My jaw went slack as the air thickened, becoming a viscous, Resistance filling my lungs, choking me, suffocating my words. I opened my mouth to speak but only a strangled wheeze emerged, sending ripples of silence across the crowd.

Suddenly, movement at the back. The sea of faces parted, revealing a silhouette, growing larger as it approached with slow, deliberate steps. A chill slithered down my spine as the figure stepped into the light. Myself. 

Freaked out by this doppelg√§nger, I staggered back, raising a trembling hand in front of me. My reflection mimicked the gesture, eyes gleaming with malice. The creature lunged forward, its form twisting, stretching, the edge of its lips curling into a cruel smile.

With a blood-curdling shriek, the creature merged with me, fusing with my body. I screamed, thrashing against the invasion, but it was useless. My arms, legs, my very identity dissolve, reconfiguring into something...
Monstrous.

Powerful.

The anxiety, the fear - they faded, replaced by a sickening rush of elation. This was my true form, this beast rising within. The creature, my creature, turned to face the audience, its mouth splitting wide in a savage snarl.

The creature's voice boomed through my head: "You don't have to be afraid anymore. This is what you are. This is what you do."

The audience erupted into screams, scrambling to escape. But it was too late. The creature's claws extended, razor-sharp. It was time to feed.

My eyes snapped open, heart pounding, sweat dripping down my temple. Just a dream. Just the anxiety talking. I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. It wasn't real. It wasn't real. But the memory of those maligned eyes, the wrongness of that smile, lingered, refusing to fade as I staggered out of bed to prepare for the presentation that awaited me in the wakeful world.
