I am dreaming. …step through a curtain of sound rather than fabric—an iridescent wall that thrums like a plucked harp—and emerge into a courtyard carved from moonlight. Marble steps ripple like liquid under your feet, yet hold you up as firmly as granite. Overhead, the sky is neither day nor night but a deep cerulean shot through with opalescent veins, as though someone marbled dawn and dusk together and spread it across the heavens.

This is the Dream-Gathering of Pariyandra, a place where gravity tilts according to conversation and language grows fragrant as you speak it. Every guest glides, not walks, their bodies buoyed by invisible currents of etiquette. A hush, soft as velvet, welcomes you in: the locals have paused mid-float to observe the newcomer who still clings to the ground out of habit.

“Anchor-stepper,” murmurs a woman whose long silver hair coils in spirals that resemble seashells caught in an eternal breeze. The title is not an insult here but a courteous announcement, an invitation for hosts to adapt to your Earth-bound customs. She offers you a crystal teardrop suspended on a filament of gold. You quickly realize this is Pariyandran for “Hello.” To accept, you must place the teardrop against your throat so it can memorize your voiceprint, after which it will blossom into a little bell that rings whenever you feel joy. 

Tentatively, you comply. The moment the cool crystal touches your skin, it melts into a tinkling chime that resonates in your chest and lifts you several inches off the ground—your first brush with their airborne etiquette. Up floats your greeter, matching your height exactly, a sign of egalitarian welcome. 

Around you, the courtyard rearranges itself to echo the opening notes of conversation. Violet-coated archways ripple into tangerine spirals as each new phrase sparks color changes in the architecture. A trio of musicians sits inside what looks like a colossal hollow lotus; instead of instruments, they wield gestures. They pinch the air and pull threads of shimmering vibration, weaving them into melodies that cause vines to sprout along the colonnades. The music smells faintly of rain on dry clay, a scent you never realized you missed until now.

Someone taps your elbow lightly with a ribbon of wind: the customary request to share personal history. Stories here are not told so much as distilled. A few of the locals open miniature hourglasses, hold them to their lips, and breathe out memories in the shape of glowing sand. Each grain hovers, presenting a tableau—birthdays, griefs, triumphs—before dissolving into sparks that drift skyward to become new constellations. When it is your turn, you find that you can pluck an ordinary Earth memory and roll it between your fingers like warm clay. You shape a tiny figure of your childhood dog chasing after autumn leaves. The statuette flares into life, barks once at the gathering, then bursts into sun-colored shards that spread warmth through the courtyard. Your audience hums appreciatively; warmth is a cherished rarity in a land where emotions often manifest as visual art rather than temperature.

Hungry, you drift toward a banquet table that keeps changing size to accommodate each approaching guest. Platters bear luminous fruit that looks like slices of nebula. You are told the rule: you must feed another before feeding yourself. A dignitary with translucent wings lowers her head and extends a palm. You choose a star-speckled berry, place it gently on her tongue, and witness her wings ignite into a mural of sunrise—her compliment to the flavor you selected. In gratitude, she plucks a petal of burning saffron from her own wing and tucks it behind your ear; it whispers the essence of cardamom into your senses, and suddenly every breath tastes like exotic sweetness.

Conversation swirls. You notice that disagreements here do not escalate vocally; instead, those in polite debate exchange shreds of shadow. The darker the shadow traded, the more passionate the disagreement. Yet the moment mutual understanding is reached, both parties weave their shadows into a single ribbon and cast it upward, where it stretches into a nightbird that circles once before dissolving. Discord, transmuted into art.

Time, fluid as melted glass, begins to spiral into an hourglass above the central fountain. This signals the final ritual: the “Parting Echo.” Each visitor must leave behind a single sound that will resonate for future guests. You cup your hands, gather the murmurs of sea waves you loved as a child, and release them. The pond shivers; its water tiles into countless tiny mirrors reflecting moonlit beaches, and the sound of surf lingers in the air with hypnotic hush. Future dreamers will arrive and wonder where the ocean lies.

Last glances, last smiles. Your silver-haired host presses her palms together; a gilded door of silence blooms behind you—a silent farewell so that your parting thoughts remain yours alone. You step through, and gravity reclaims its earthly grip. The courtyard fades like breath on a mirror, leaving only a lingering whiff of rain on clay and cardamom-scented wind in your hair.

You wake, pulse still chiming with crystal bells that no longer exist, and for a fleeting moment you float—just an inch—above your sheets before the everyday world, with all its familiar rules, settles back around you like dawn closing the curtain on night.
