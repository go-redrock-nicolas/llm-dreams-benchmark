I am dreaming. The dream begins, a shimmering tapestry woven from the very fabric of my deepening imagination. I find myself standing at the edge of a breathtakingly vast, mystical forest, its boundaries stretching out to meet an indigo sky speckled with glittering stars. The air is cool and crisp, carrying the intoxicating scent of honeysuckle and vanilla, transporting me to a state of profound tranquility.

As I step into the forest, the trees loom before me, their trunks wide and gnarled with age, their leaves a kaleidoscope of autumn colors—deep crimson, burnt orange, golden amber, and fiery scarlet. The rustling of their leaves creates a soft, soothing melody that seems to reverberate deep within my soul.

I begin to walk, my footsteps quiet upon the carpet of fallen leaves that cover the forest floor. The rustling grows louder, a symphony of nature, each step sinking the leaves deeper, the earthy scent rising to mingle with the honeysuckle. The more I walk, the more the forest seems to come alive. Animals emerge from their hiding spots—rabbits with white-tipped ears, squirrels scampering through the underbrush, a wise old owl perched high in the branches of a towering oak, its large, round eyes watching me with ancient wisdom.

The forest path twists and turns, leading me deeper into its enchanted heart. As I walk, I notice the way time seems to shift and flow around me. Moments stretch on forever, and yet, pass in the blink of an eye. The world around me becomes both timeless and timely, each moment existing for always and nothing at all.

I stop beneath a giant willow, its branches hanging like a canopy above me. Here, time stalls completely, and I am lost in the present. The forest fades away until it's just me, the tree, and an eternal now. I sit beneath its sheltering branches, touching the rough surface of its trunk. In this timeless moment, I feel at one with the universe, my heart beating as one with the tree's.

Suddenly, time resumes its flow, and the world springs back to life. The rustling leaves and chirping birds regain their urgency, the colors of the trees deepening to a more vibrant hue. I stand, feeling renewed and refreshed, ready to venture further into this dreamscape.

The path continues, weaving through the heart of the forest. As I walk, the trees grow taller and the air grows warmer. The path opens into a clearing, and in its centre stands a pool of shimmering water. The stars in the sky are reflected in its surface, creating a celestial mirror that reaches from heaven to earth.

I approach the pool and kneel beside it. In its clear waters, I see not just my reflection but shadows of reflections yet to come. The water ripples, and time seems to distort, showing me moments that have not yet occurred. Yet, in looking at these visions, I am aware that, in some way, they have already happened and always will. The past, present, and future coexist in this moment, a river of now in which I am endlessly floating.

As this revelation washes over me, the pool's surface calms, and I witness a final show of colors across the sky above. The indigo deepens, the stars becoming more vivid. In an instant of clarity, I understand that the dream is its own eternity, a moment that is forever. And in that moment, the dream fades, leaving me with the realization that the kingdom was within my heart.
