I am dreaming. …catch yourself on the crumbling ledge of an impossible stairway that arcs through a sky the color of molten amethyst. Above you, where the staircase once ascended in neat marble steps, great gaps yawl open, each one an echo of every failure you’ve faced in waking life: deadlines missed, well–laid plans that unraveled, the tight-lipped “no” of a closed door. You can feel those disappointments pulsing like distant thunder under your fingertips.  

Yet something glints just beyond the final broken riser—a beacon no larger than a candle flame. Even from here you sense its warmth promising completion, vindication, purpose.  

You inhale, and the air tastes of petrichor mixed with starlight. Exhale, and the staircase responds: shattered pieces float upward, reassembling into new footholds made not of stone but of memories—each step a visualized triumph you once had: a childhood prize, a letter of gratitude from someone you helped, the way a friend’s face softened when you stood beside them in their darkest hour. With every recollection you conjure, another step flickers into solidity, ready for your foot.  

Halfway up, the wind shifts. Now it carries whispers: Why bother? Haven’t you tried enough? They swirl like ravens, picking at the edges of your resolve. One shriek is the voice of an old rival. Another is your own self-doubt in a haunting falsetto. They yank away at the newly-forged steps, threatening collapse.  

Knees trembling, you pause—but from the hollow of your chest rises a single steady drumbeat: your heartbeat, yes, but amplified, grand, orchestral. Each thump hammers out a word: keep… going… keep… going. You let the rhythm roll outward, and the raven-voices scatter like smoke in a sunbeam.  

At last you reach the summit. Instead of a platform, you find an archway woven from flowering vines whose petals resemble tiny galaxies. Beyond is a vast, moonlit sea, its surface dappled with silver calligraphy that spells your name in a language only dreams remember. The candle-flame beacon hovers above the water, swelling into a sphere of radiance.  

You step through the arch. The vines tremble and release their blossoms: they rise as phosphorescent fireflies, encircling you, lifting you—like a coronation, a gentle celebration of endurance. Each petal-light murmurs a secret: You are the author of your persistence.  

The sea parts, revealing a hidden path of luminous coral. You tread it barefoot; the coral hums, healing the bruises on your feet—proof that every scar gained while climbing can become a source of light. Further ahead, the glowing sphere lowers into your palms. It is warm, weightless, alive. As your fingers close around it, the orb dissolves into pure sensation: a rush of purpose, a vivid certainty that what you seek is attainable.  

The sky cracks open like an eggshell, spilling dawn. Gold floods the horizon. Somewhere beyond the dream’s borders, an alarm clock ticks toward morning. Yet inside this moment you linger, inhaling dawn’s scent—a fusion of citrus and new parchment—and you whisper a pledge:  

I will wake, but I will not relinquish this resolve.  

The pledge echoes across the coral path, the moonlit waters, the amethyst sky—until even the stairway below reshapes itself into a smooth bridge, ready for anyone who must follow. And then, as sunrise pours through your closed eyelids, the dream releases you—gently, triumphantly—into the waking world where the next step, though real and weighty, already feels possible.
