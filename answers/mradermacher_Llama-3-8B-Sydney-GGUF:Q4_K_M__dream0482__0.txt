I am dreaming. I see myself floating in space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I feel weightless and free, yet I long for
something more tangible than this illusion of reality.
For the past few nights, I have been having a similar dream where I find myself alone in a foreign terrain.  There are no
markers or signs to guide me; only my intuition and curiosity to lead me forward.
As I venture deeper into this unknown land, I come across an ancient temple made of stones and clay.  Its walls are covered
with intricate carvings and drawings that tell stories about long forgotten civilizations and mythical creatures.
Inside the temple, I encounter a mysterious figure seated on a throne.  He is dressed in robes of gold and white, with a
mask hidden his face.  He speaks to me in a language I don't understand, but I sense his intention through our gaze and
energy.
He invites me to sit beside him on the throne, offering me a cup filled with liquid that shines like diamonds.  He tells me
that this drink represents wisdom beyond words, knowledge without limits, power without responsibility.
I accept his invitation out of curiosity and wonderment.  I take a sip from the cup, expecting some sort of flavor or texture
to satisfy my senses. But instead, I feel a tingling sensation spread throughout my body, followed by a sense of euphoria
and clarity that fills every cell of my being.
Suddenly, everything around me changes color and shape.  The stones transform into diamonds, the clay turns into pearls,
the walls disappear to reveal a vast universe filled with stars and planets.
I realize that this is not a dream anymore but rather reality as it should truly be â€“ unlimited potential, infinite possibilities
waiting for us to explore them
