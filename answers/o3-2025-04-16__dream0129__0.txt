I am dreaming. …take a breath that tastes of eucalyptus and moon-sweetened rain, and I begin to speak, my words floating into the hush the way colored glass drifts into sunlight.

“I was ten years old the night the river spilled out of its banks,” I tell the circle. “In my town the river was supposed to be tame—a ribbon of pewter that only whispered. But that night it roared like a broken violin. We’d been celebrating an early spring; the orchards were still wearing their fragile crowns of white petals. My father had gone to the levee to ‘check the gates,’ he said, and my mother paced, her hands flaring like startled birds. I stood at the window, feeling the glass trembling against my forehead as water licked the streets.

“The power went out, and with it the thin line of my courage. For the longest two hours of my childhood, the house was a raft cracked loose from everything that meant safety—no light, no voice from my father’s old transistor radio, nothing but water pushing against the doors like a giant’s breath. My mother tried to keep me busy boiling rainwater on a camping stove, but each hiss of steam only reminded me the river was out there, devouring fences and swing sets and the chalk drawings I’d left on the sidewalk that afternoon.

“Then the sirens stopped. No more distant whoop-whoop, just a violent silence. I thought that was the moment the world ended, because even disaster has a soundtrack—when it cuts off, you’re left floating in the ache of its absence. I hid inside the hallway closet, knees clamped to my chest. I can still feel the wool coats pressing against my shoulders, absorbing the hammer of my heartbeat. So small a space, but even that cupboard had waves, I swear it—motion, heaving, like the river had seeped into wood grain.

“When the flood receded three days later, we found our backyard layered with silt that glimmered bronze in the broken sun. Between the drowned marigolds and the warped garden gate, I uncovered my sketchbook. The water had peeled apart the pages, turning my pencil dragons and hopeful constellations into grey feathers, blurred, flying nowhere. I remember standing there, mud to my ankles, knowing something inside me had changed shape for good—like clay dropped from the potter’s wheel, impossible to return to its first idea.”

The circle is quiet—only the faint chime of hanging crystals and the heartbeat-drone of, perhaps, some unseen ocean. I look up and see eyes cradling my story as though it’s a fledgling bird. No one moves to fix me, to erase the memory. They simply let it breathe.

A facilitator dressed in linen as pale as dawn asks, “What does that river still tell you?”

I exhale. “That water can both dissolve a thing and polish it. I lost drawings, yes, but I also learned to redraw. When the current inside me rises now, I sketch anyway—on napkins, on receipts, on the fogged bathroom mirror—because creation becomes a bridge.”

Someone, a stranger whose name I don’t yet know, nods. Another opens a palm in silent acknowledgment. All around, the sanctuary’s walls brighten—amethyst veins in the quartz panels ignite like distant galaxies. I sense the room collecting every unfinished sentence, every cracked memory, weaving them into a tapestry vast enough to carry us all.

And for the first time since the dream began, the hush in my chest feels like silence by choice rather than silence by storm.
