I am dreaming. —I find myself suspended between the familiar and the surreal, the atmosphere pulsing with a peculiar anticipation. The hour is glassy and strange; streetlights outside my window flicker in slow motion, bending their light into colors I’ve never seen before. I step out onto the street, the air ripe with the scent of something electric on the cusp of breaking.

I know, with the certainty that dreams often provide, that something calamitous will soon rend this world’s fragile fabric. My heart drums an insistent warning. I see people walking dogs, sipping coffee, scrolling through glowing rectangles, their faces serene, utterly untroubled. I stop a young woman in a crimson coat, my urgency spilling over in my words, my hands trembling as I speak. She smiles politely, her eyes glazed, and continues on—she cannot hear the thunder gathering beneath my words.

Thirty minutes. I try again, raising my voice, gesturing to the roiling clouds above—a churning mass, folding and unfurling in unnatural patterns. I beg the old man with the newspaper; I plead with the group of children hopscotching in chalked squares. They laugh lightly, catching only the edges of my panic.

Panic swells in me, but I press it down, scraping together every last bit of composure. My steps turn purposeful, ringing sharper against the impossible geometry of dream-concrete. If I cannot persuade, then I will not fray—I will bear witness.

Fifteen minutes. The sky has developed a fracture, a long, luminescent crack that spills iridescent mist into the fevered air. Shadows lengthen, twisting into curious shapes. I climb the tallest building in the city, the staircase unfolding infinitely beneath my feet, until at last I stand atop it, overlooking a world about to tip into oblivion.

With five minutes left, my fear transforms. I realize that I am not powerless. Even if no one listens, I can observe and remember—be the chronicler when no one else believes. I close my eyes, steady my breath, and listen to the universe counting down in a language of shifting winds and distant thunder. In the final moments, I open my arms, hum a melody from childhood, and let the unknown wash over me. The fabric of reality peels away in a crescendo of color and sensation, and I surrender—not with dread, but with awe, trusting that on the other side of this catastrophe lies another dream, quietly waiting to be born.
