I am dreaming. I slip deeper into the dream, and suddenly I’m the chief architect of a ceremony unlike any the world has ever seen—the Rite of the Falling Stars, held on a shifting island that drifts between dawn and dusk. Daylight here is a living color: honeyed gold that ripples like silk, phosphorescent shadows that dance with every footstep. From somewhere overhead comes a low, resonant hum, as if the sky itself is tuning to the event’s frequency.  

At first, everything seems under control. I wander through halls carved from opalescent shell, directing legions of silent attendants whose eyes glint like quicksilver. I taste salt on my lips and smell the sea breeze creeping in through wide-open arches. A massive stained-glass window fractures the late-afternoon sun into prismatic rivers that flow across the marble floor, guiding my way to the grand auditorium where thousands will gather.  

But then the details begin to slip. The hourglass counting down to the opening ceremony runs backward, its sand clumping into black pearls that vanish the instant they touch the ground. Couriers arrive trembling, their parchments inked in smudged letters I can’t quite decipher—oh, those runes keep melting into each other like candle wax in the heat. I glance at my clipboard—every line item is crossed out, rewritten, then crossed out again by fingers that aren’t mine.  

Outside, the floating island shudders. Deep cracks spider-web across the alabaster terraces, and ribbons of violet mist pour from the fissures. The breeze catches them, carrying the scent of scorched lavender and ozone. I feel panic rise in my chest as the spectral attendants begin to dissolve, their forms flickering between human and something bestial. I shout directions, but my voice comes out in reverse—each command an echo that races backward into the walls.  

Time fractures. One moment I’m racing down a hallway that lengthens into infinity; the next, I’m perched at the edge of the island, peering down at an ocean of liquid mirror. On that mirrored surface, I see the faces of every person invited—each one morphing into a thousand versions of themselves, judging me. The sky overhead is a vast clock with hands that twist and bend. Midnight threatens even before the sun has fully set.  

My heart thrums in my ears. I scrabble through a nest of tangled blueprints that rustle like living birds. The stage I designed has sprouted legs and is trying to walk away; the ceremonial torches sputter into ghost-fire and refuse to ignite. I tear at my hair, willing the components to fall back into place, but instead the island groans as if disgusted by my fumbling.  

Then, as panic becomes paralysis, I catch a glimmer of something through the haze: a single crystalline tree standing at the island’s center, its roots winding into every hallway and corridor. Its leaves glow with a calm, steady light. I realize this tree is the heart of the event—if I can channel its energy, perhaps I can override the chaos.  

I step through the cracking corridors, gather the last of my courage, and place my trembling hand on the tree’s trunk. A rush of warmth blossoms in my palm; the island stills. The runes on the scrolls reassemble themselves into clear, confident script. The floating terraces seal their fractures with tendrils of golden light. The stage tips back on its pedestal.  

And then, as the first violet star slides into view above the gallery, the ceremony begins—an echo of triumph reverberating through dream and dawn.
