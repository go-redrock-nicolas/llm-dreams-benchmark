I am dreaming. —I slip into a realm where color and sound weave together in impossible patterns, and the air itself pulses with the feeling of possibility. In this dream, as I become lucid, I see those unconscious rules—those invisible fences shaped by echoes from my childhood and shadows of former failures—manifesting all around me as towering, crystalline walls. Their surfaces shimmer, etched with words like “You can’t,” and “Not for you,” the phrases of my own hesitation.

But the sky here is not the tired gray of doubt; it’s ablaze with wild, ever-shifting hues. I reach out, my fingertips tingling with the electric certainty that magic lives in daring. The walls pulse and tremble at my approach. I realize, suddenly, that these barriers are glass spun from old fears, and I carry within me the ability to shatter them.

I press my hand against the cold surface. Across the wall, dream-memories flicker: missed opportunities, times I shrank instead of standing tall, limits I swallowed as gospel. Gathering all the hope in my heart, I whisper, “What if you’re wrong?” The wall warms beneath my palm, fractures snaking across its body.

Where the crystalline rules splinter, images bloom—infinite versions of myself, unencumbered, laughing, leaping, creating, loving fiercely. I draw in a breath deep as the ocean, step forward, and with a sudden surge, the glass disintegrates into a confetti rain of possibility. The debris of old beliefs melt into the ground, nourishing wildflowers that spell, “Anything can be.”

There is no path, only open meadows, mountains of potential rising in violet mist, rivers of inspiration coursing with liquid silver. Each way forward is a promise—not of certainty, but of freedom. I am lighter now, gazelle-swift, my pulse a drumbeat of adventure. All the world—every world—is open, and I understand, with luminous clarity, that the only true limits are those I choose to keep.

I run, laughing into the sunrise, eager to see where my courage will take me next.
