I am dreaming. …notice you are walking along a corridor lined with tall, gilded mirrors. The hallway stretches into a haze, each mirror reflecting back an image of yourself in different stages of excitement, worry, or relief. It is a twilight realm: the air hums with a quiet electricity, and the velvety carpet underneath your feet pulses like some living, breathing creature.

At first, you only hear the faint echo of laughter, far away and spectral, beckoning you forward. You have this strange sense that the laughter belongs to your friends and acquaintances, the very people you expect to see at the upcoming social event. Despite the warmth in their voices, a flicker of dread seizes your chest each time you take a step. You realize then that you are carrying a large satchel on your shoulder. Every time your heart starts to pound with anxiety, the satchel grows heavier, clinking and rattling with objects you can’t quite identify.

Curiously, you stop at one of the mirrors to investigate. You see your own eyes wide with apprehension. The reflection, though, seems to move on its own accord, raising a hand and pointing to the satchel. Your dream logic tells you that inside, you carry every negative thought you’ve ever had about social gatherings: the fear of awkward moments, the embarrassment of possible rejection, the expectation of friction that has never truly materialized before.

As you stare into the mirror, the reflection shifts. The glass ripples like pond water touched by a pebble. Murky shapes emerge behind the mirror-self—memories of uneventful but nerve-wracking parties: the rattling teacups and half-forgotten small talk. You see them swirl around your mirror image and then melt, dripping into the corridor around your feet. Where the echoes of worry seep into the carpet, strange flowers bloom: tall and wispy, with blossoms shaped like question marks. Their petals glint with an iridescent shimmer, inviting you to pluck one.

With trembling curiosity, you reach down and pick a question-mark blossom. The moment you do, the corridor elongates into a ballroom. Soft lights float orb-like near the ceiling, as if held aloft by invisible strings. Music flutters in from nowhere. Your anxiety does not vanish entirely, but in the warm glow of this surreal space, it feels manageable—like a timid child peeking out from behind your legs, rather than a towering force in your heart.

Suddenly, the satchel on your shoulder clinks again. Overcome by curiosity, you slip it off and peer inside. Dozens of small, glittering keys lie in a jumble, each one etched with delicate patterns. You sense that one of these keys might unlock the tension in your chest—some intangible door that leads to calmness before the big event. As you sort through them, you find that each key seems to correspond to a particular memory of relief or connection, a moment when your fears didn’t come to pass: the instant someone complimented your outfit when you feared no one would notice you; the time you discovered a shared passion with an acquaintance you had barely known before.

The music swells, and with each note, your surroundings shimmer. A glass door appears across the dance floor. Even at a distance, you hear it humming, as if beckoning you to unlock it with one of your keys. You make your way to the door, the luminous blossoms nodding encouragingly like friends cheering you on. Your breath feels steady, under control, and the satchel is lighter. Anxiety still whispers in the back of your mind, but you’re fueled by an electric curiosity: What happens if you open that door?

Standing before it, you choose a key that is engraved with a small star. Somehow, you know it represents hope. The key slides effortlessly into the lock, and the glass door swings wide to reveal a lush courtyard under a silver moon. Laughter and soft conversation ripple through the courtyard, and though the figures there remain hazy, you sense genuine warmth waiting on the other side.

As you step forward, the corridor behind you fades away. A gentle breeze carries the sweet scent of jasmine, and you see a group of dreamlike silhouettes waving in welcome. Butterflies alight on marble banisters, worn from years of laughter and conversation. This courtyard is the culmination of all the best feelings that social gatherings bring: connection, acceptance, the spark of new friendships, and the cozy comfort of familiar faces.

In the stillness of that moment, you realize that your anticipation is both fear and excitement, mingled together. You place the satchel at your feet, letting its load of rattling worries spill onto the ground like curious trinkets that, when left alone, lose their weight. Light flows in to fill the space where your dread once was. With a renewed sense of warmth and possibility, you cross the threshold—stepping fully into the dream, prepared to discover all the joys that await.
