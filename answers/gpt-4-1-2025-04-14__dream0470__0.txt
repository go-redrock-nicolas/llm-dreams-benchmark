I am dreaming.

In this vivid dream, I walk barefoot through a sunlit forest, every leaf shimmering with memories I once ignored. I wander deeper, and the air hums with the music of gratitude—low, gentle notes rising from the moss, melodic whispers floating down from the ancient oak trees.

Shafts of sunlight pierce high boughs, illuminating simple wonders: the generous caress of a breeze, the crisp flavor of a newly plucked apple, the soft laughter echoing from unseen friends. With every step, the texture of gratitude grows richer. The pebbles beneath my feet remind me of steady ground; the bird song reminds me that I am not alone in my world. I watch as my hands—the very hands I so often overlook—smooth the bark of a birch tree, and feel struck by awe at the warmth and dexterity they hold within them.

This luminous forest becomes a gallery of overlooked blessings. Along the path, there are vignettes: the gentle smile of a neighbor, rays of dawn filtering through curtains, the perfume of coffee at daybreak. Each is magnified, vivid—their beauty obvious now, as if my soul has been waiting its whole life to fully see them.

Gratitude builds within, warm and rising, expanding in my chest until I can hardly contain it. The boundaries between myself and the forest begin to blur. Dew on my skin, sunlight in my hair, laughter in the currents of air—all merge into one great, billowing tapestry of thankfulness.

I feel humbled by the sheer abundance that has always surrounded me: a thousand tiny miracles living quietly in every ordinary day. I breathe this awareness in deeply, and exhale with wonder—knowing that just as dreams carry us through hidden landscapes, gratitude can reveal the brilliant, sacred beauty threaded through all of waking life.
