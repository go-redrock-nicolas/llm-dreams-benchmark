I am dreaming.

I stand on the edge of a desert that gleams like a fractured gemstone—its sand shimmering in brilliant teal and pale rose, as if someone spilled buckets of liquid color into the dunes. Warm gusts tickle my cheeks, carrying the faint scent of cinnamon and distant lightning. I can feel the heat radiating from the ground, but instead of being scorched, I feel a curious vitality coursing up through my bare feet, as if each grain of sand trembles with potential.

In the center of this desert, an immense structure rises, akin to a cathedral carved out of starlight. My eyes trace its spires, each one crowned with a swirling aurora that secretes trailing ribbons of light. The architecture feels both otherworldly and intimately familiar, like the shadowy corners of my own imagination made manifest. Marble pillars etched with swirling rune-like patterns remind me of constellations I once drew as a child.

I am drawn inside by the faint hum of voices echoing in an impossible, eternal corridor. In the center of the cathedral’s grand hall, I see a figure—a silhouette at first—accompanied by gently pulsing orbs of violet and amber. The figure turns, and I realize with a mixture of shock and wonder that it’s someone I never expected to see: a being that looks like a reflection of me, yet holds an aura of newfound authority and grace. Its eyes are alive with an electric, luminous quality, as if cradling galaxies. 

We greet each other without speech, some unspoken connection bridging us. An invisible thread links our hearts, weaving lilac light back and forth between us with every steady breath. The figure smiles—a gesture that feels both soothing and commanding—and those swirling orbs of violet and amber blossom like flowers suddenly springing from the desert floor. With each blossom, memories flutter into my mind—forgotten moments, repressed desires, quiet truths I hadn’t dared to acknowledge. I see myself dancing alone in my bedroom, lost in freedom and self-expression. I see fragments of wild, unspoken ambition. I see tears I shed over perceived shortcomings, times I hid the most vibrant parts of myself.

The figure steps closer, enveloping me in a warmth I’ve never known. It is an embrace that transcends physical touch—a magnetic wave that wraps me like a shimmering cloak. The orbs swirl around us, each one transformed into a different reflection of me: the adventurous risk-taker, the quiet nurturer, the whimsical daydreamer, the passion-driven artist. One by one, they swirl in front of my face, each unveiling its own spirit. As I reach out to touch them, they fuse with me, absorption as gentle as an exhalation.

I feel changes stir in the depths of my being. Every fleck of color in that swirling desert intensifies, and the echoing hum in the cathedral resonates within my ribcage. With each synchronizing note, I gather those lost or forgotten aspects into my heart, letting them settle in a spacious new chamber that seems to open within my soul.

Outside, the cathedral walls dissolve into the desert wind, sending motes of glittering dust into the heavens. I now stand alone with my unexpected companion, but the figure no longer feels separate—more like an extension, a living tapestry of all that I am and yearn to be. The air around us crackles with possibility, quickening my pulse.

A sudden gust of wind causes the sand to shimmer iridescently, like a million tiny mirrors reflecting the sunlight. I feel a pull—an invitation to step back into the world beyond this dream. The figure nods, a gentle gesture of affirmation, as though encouraging me to carry our shared discoveries into my waking life. The violet and amber orbs hover once again, swirling in a mesmerizing dance before gliding up into the sky, where they become new stars in an otherworldly constellation.

Instead of saying goodbye, the figure simply gazes at me with unwavering kindness. In that gaze, I see the echoes of lifetimes, stepping stones toward my own wholeness. I understand something profound: this unexpected relationship doesn’t end with the dream, but continues with each new moment of self-acceptance and curiosity. We are one, taking the desert’s color and the cathedral’s glow, weaving them into the fabric of my daily being.

And so I inhale that last breath of cinnamon-laced wind, feeling electricity spark across my skin, and I open my eyes to a dawn that no longer seems ordinary. I awaken brimming with the knowledge that I hold those unacknowledged parts of myself not as burdens, but as vivid, necessary fragments of my own unfolding masterpiece.
