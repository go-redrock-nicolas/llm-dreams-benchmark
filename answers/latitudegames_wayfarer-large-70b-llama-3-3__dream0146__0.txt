I am dreaming. Suddenly, I become acutely aware that I am dreaming and find myself standing in the middle of a charred, apocalyptic landscape. The ground beneath my feet is scorched and barren, littered with the blackened skeletons of what once were ancient trees. The sky above, a deep crimson and orange, thickens with smoke that carries the acrid smell of burning vegetation.

As I look around frantically for an escape route, the crackling of intense flames grows louder from all directions. The fire is closing in, its heat already searing the skin on my face and hands. A dry, suffocating cough strains my lungs as I inhale the toxic smoke.

Through the haze, I spot a massive wall of flames advancing towards me from the north. The inferno stretches across the horizon, a terrifying sight of orange and yellow tongues of fire that seem to roar with a life of their own. In the opposite direction, I glimpse another fireline quickly eating up the remaining ground between me and what might have been safety.

My heart pounds in my chest as adrenaline courses through my body, urging me to run. But every path I look towards feels equally treacherous. A southern trail offers a potential route through a narrow ravine, only to be cut off by a wall of fire rushing down the steep incline. To the east, a seemingly clear path suddenly disappears beneath falling embers and burning debris raining down from above.

As panic sets in, I realize I'm trapped in this nightmare of my own creation. The fire has become real, closing in on me from all sides. I hear the deafening roar of the flames, feel the searing heat penetrating my skin. My lungs burn with every desperate breath.
