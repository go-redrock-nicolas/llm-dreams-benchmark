I am dreaming. The dream is a rain forest with towering trees glistening under a silver moon. I see myself walking on a path of glowing moss, stepping over roots that pulse like arteries. The air hums with unseen life—butterflies with stained-glass wings flutter past, and somewhere, a creature laughs like wind chimes. Suddenly, the ground beneath me transforms into liquid glass, and I’m floating upwards, weightless, through layers of sky—each one a different color. In the final layer, I meet a version of myself who’s wearing a crown of vines and starlight. She smiles and says, "You see? Even broken pieces can hold constellations."
