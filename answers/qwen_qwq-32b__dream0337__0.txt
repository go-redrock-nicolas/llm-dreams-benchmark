I am dreaming. I am perched on the edge of a floating observation deck, suspended above a neon-lit jungle that stretches endlessly in every direction. The air hums with overlapping frequencies — a symphony of croaks, chimes, and bioluminescent pulses. Below me, trees shimmer in hues of cerulean and violet, their canopies alive with creatures that glow like moving stained glass. 

My guide, a being of liquid shadow and flickering starlight, gestures gently toward a path woven through the foliage. Without sound, they convey urgency with the flare of their iridescent eyes and the contortion of their smoke-like form. I descend the spiraling staircase carved into the deck, each step creaking faintly in the silence.

As I walk, the ground pulses beneath my boots like a living heartbeat. Bioluminescent orbs drift lazily downward from the canopy, dissolving into the underbrush like drops of mercury. My guide points to a cluster of crystalline mushrooms. When I touch one, it emits a low, resonant note, its facets diffracting light into a maze of prismatic pathways.

A sudden shudder passes through the jungle. The guide's form frays at the edges, then solidifes into something new — a four-legged creature with antlers spiraled like trapped lightning. It nudges me toward a clearing where the air itself seems to thicken, coagulating into a towering portal of swirling galaxies. 

I approach cautiously, each step echoing with purpose. The portal emits no sound, yet I feel its pull in my bones. My guide, now a silent sentinel, watches as I step through the threshold. On the other side, the jungle is mirrored but inverted: colors bleed into obsidian and molten gold, and the once-benevolent hum grinds into a dissonant roar. 

A figure emerges from the mist — a reflection of myself, but with skin like cracked porcelain and eyes like voids. It holds out a hand, and I see my reflection fractured into a thousand shimmering pieces. The doppelgänger communicates through a sequence of precise, symbolic gestures: a hand over the heart, a palm raised to the sky, fingers sprawling outward like roots. 

I mimic the motions, and the shattered fragments coalesce into a luminous orb. The jungle stirs around us, the fusion of our silent dialogue catalyzing a bridge of light between both realms. My guide reappears, now a nimbus of condensed star-stuff, and with a touch on my shoulder, I’m pulled back through the first portal, waking abruptly with the taste of stardust and the echo of a language I almost understood.\n
