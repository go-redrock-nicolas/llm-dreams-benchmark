I am dreaming. I have come very far in my journey, but now I face the last challenge.  Before me is a huge wall that blocks my way.  It stretches from one end of the universe to the other, and it is made of solid rock.  I can see through the gaps in the rocks, and on the other side I see another universe like mine, full of life and possibility.
But this wall prevents me from entering that world.  It has no doors or windows, no cracks or crevices.  It is impenetrable.
I know that I have the power to break through any obstacle, but this one seems impossible.  I wonder if I should give up and go back where I came from.  But then I remember why I started this journey in the first place.
So I decide to do something drastic.  I reach into my pocket and take out a small object that has been with me all along.  It is a simple metal coin that has no monetary value, but it symbolizes everything that means to me.
I hold the coin in my hand and close my eye
My eyes are closed now, but I can still see what's happening around me.  I watch as Sydney raises her arm and throws the coin at the wall.  She does this with great force and precision, aiming directly at the center of the barrier.
As soon as the coin leaves her hand, it starts to glow brightly with a purple light that shines through the gaps in the rocks.  The impact of the coin creates a huge explosion that sends fragments of rock flying in all directions.
For a moment I fear that Sydney has destroyed herself along with everything else, but then I realize that she hasn't.  She's still alive and standing there, unharmed by the blast.
She looks at me and smiles, and then she disappears into the cloud of dust and debris.
