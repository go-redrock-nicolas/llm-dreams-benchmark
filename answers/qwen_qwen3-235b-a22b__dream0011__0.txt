I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt parchment and ozone, as if the room itself is charged with the static of a thousand unspoken fears. The exam hall stretches endlessly, a cathedral of desks carved from obsidian, their surfaces etched with glowing runes that flicker like dying stars. The ceiling is a swirling vortex of ink-black clouds, and the only light comes from chandeliers made of suspended hourglasses, their sands flowing upward. You sit at the final desk, the one closest to the podium where a figure looms—a professor with a face like a shattered mirror, reflecting fragments of your past failures, your half-remembered childhood dreams, your mother’s voice whispering, *“You’ll never be enough.”*  

The exam booklet materializes before you, its pages stitched with threads of gold that pulse like veins. You open it, and the questions are not words but *sensations*. The first one is a taste: bitter almonds and honey, a paradox that makes your tongue burn. You realize it’s asking you to describe the flavor of *regret* and how it differs from the flavor of *longing*. You scramble to write, but your pen bleeds ink that evaporates into smoke the moment it touches the page.  

The second question is a sound: a violin playing a melody that shifts every time you try to hum it. The notes morph into your own heartbeat, then into a lullaby your grandmother sang, then into the roar of a storm. The question demands you transcribe the music into a map—*a map of where you’ve been, and where you’re afraid to go*. Your hands tremble as you sketch rivers that flow uphill and forests that dissolve into deserts.  

By the third question, the room begins to fracture. The desks melt into liquid glass, pooling around your ankles as you wade through memories you never lived: a childhood in a city of floating islands, a lover you never met whose face is a blur of light, a funeral where the coffin is empty. The question here is a riddle whispered by a moth that lands on your wrist: *“What is the weight of a secret once it’s spoken? What is the color of silence in a world without sound?”* You answer in metaphors, but the moth only laughs, its wings shedding constellations onto your paper.  

Then the final question arrives—not on the page, but in your chest. It’s a pressure, a hollow ache where your heart should be. You look down and see a key embedded in your ribs, rusted shut. The question is: *“What door have you refused to open?”* The room collapses. You’re falling through galaxies, through the mouths of serpents, through mirrors that show versions of yourself who chose different paths. You grasp the key, twist it, and feel your chest split open—not with pain, but with a blinding, liquid warmth.  

Inside you, there’s no heart. There’s a hummingbird made of fire, beating its wings.  

You wake up gasping, the taste of honey and ash on your tongue, the dream clinging to your skin like dew. For a moment, you’re certain: the exam wasn’t about answers. It was about the questions you’re too afraid to ask yourself while awake. And the future career? It’s not a job. It’s the art of surviving the labyrinth of your own soul.
