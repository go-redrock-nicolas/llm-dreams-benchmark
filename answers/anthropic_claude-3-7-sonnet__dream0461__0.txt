I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the threshold of an ancient library where the air shimmers with suspended flecks of gold dust. The ceiling arches impossibly high, disappearing into a swirling cosmos where galaxies birth and die in slow motion. Bookshelves spiral upward like DNA helices, their wooden frames breathing gently as though alive. I realize with sudden clarity that I've been here countless times before, yet somehow always forget upon waking.

As I move forward, my feet don't quite touch the floor—I drift like a dandelion seed on invisible currents. The books call to me in voices like distant bells, each spine illuminated with script that rearranges itself when I attempt to read it directly.

A librarian approaches, her form shifting between an elderly woman with kind eyes and a child with ancient wisdom etched across her face. Sometimes she appears as neither, but rather a column of light that speaks directly into my thoughts.

"You've returned to remember what you've forgotten," she says, her words tasting like cinnamon and starlight on my tongue.

She leads me to a reflecting pool in the center of the library where the water flows upward into an inverted fountain. When I peer into its depths, I see not my face but the faces of everyone I've ever known, everyone I will know, and countless people I'll never meet—all connected by threads of luminescent silver.

I reach my hand toward the water and the universe breathes with me.
