I am dreaming. | To survive, I must stay calm and remember avalanche safety: always carry a beacon, shovel, probe. Build a snow cave if possible. If caught, try to escape at an angle to safer terrain or grab hold of anything solid. 

The roar of the avalanche is deafening, a throaty growl ripped from the belly of the mountain itself. Snow billows like smoke in every direction, stinging my eyes and stealing my breath. I claw at the air, my skis already torn from my feet by the river of icy debris, my body tumbling like a leaf in a hurricane. The terror is electric, raw. *This is a dream*, I remind myself, but the cold is real, the weight crushing. My beacon—where is it? The thought slices through panic. Strapped close, against my ribs, its pulse thrumming beneath layers of Gore-Tex and fleece. Good. The snow hammers me, pushes me deeper into white blindness. 

I twist sideways, angling hard against the torrent, muscles screaming. *Escape the flow*. A jagged outcrop juts from the chaos—granite teeth. I reach, gloved fingers scraping rock. Hold. The mountain shudders, but I cling, boots scrambling for purchase. Above, the fracture line splits the sky, a spiderweb of menace. The slide’s fury veers past me, a hungry beast diverted. Now, the stillness. Thick. Suffocating. My pulse thunders in my ears. The snowpack groans. *Instability. More slides coming*. 

I scan the slope for shelter. A drift to the left, deep and wind-sculpted. Shovel out a hollow? No time. The probe—the telescoping rod snaps open in my fist. I plunge it downward, testing ground. *Hollow space there*. Digging now, frenzied, gloves filled with snow. The cave takes shape: a coffin-sized void. I crawl in, pack jammed overhead as a roof. Breathe slow. Exhale heat. The walls glisten, blue as twilight. Ice crystals glint like constellations. Somewhere far off, thunder rolls. The mountain isn’t done. But here, in this fragile womb of snow, I wait. Alive. Listening.
