I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt lavender, a fragrance that clings to your skin like a memory you can’t quite name. You’re standing at the edge of a vast, inverted forest—trees stretch upward into an endless obsidian sky, their roots clawing at the ground like frozen screams. Above you, constellations pulse in time with your heartbeat, each star a flickering eye watching, judging. You feel small here, as though your bones have been hollowed out and filled with whispers.  

You begin to walk, though the ground beneath you isn’t solid. It ripples like the surface of a pond, each step sending concentric rings of light shimmering into the void. A mirror appears ahead, suspended in midair, its frame woven from thorned vines that bleed sap the color of forgotten tears. When you reach it, your reflection isn’t yours. It’s a stranger with your eyes but a face carved from stone, lips sealed shut with a rusted lock. You touch the glass, and it hisses, “*You are too much. You are not enough.*”  

A voice calls your name—a sound like wind chimes shattered by a storm. You turn to see a child version of yourself, barefoot and clutching a lantern filled with dying fireflies. Their face is streaked with soot, their gaze accusing. “You left me here,” they say, and the forest shudders. The trees twist, their branches knitting into a cage around the child. You try to run, but the pond-ground turns to quicksand, sucking at your ankles. The lantern’s light dims as the fireflies smother themselves against its glass.  

Then the sky cracks.  

A fissure splits the darkness, pouring down a rain of ash and ash-gray petals. Each petal dissolves on contact with your skin, leaving behind words: *failure, unworthy, broken*. The voice of the child merges with the storm, chanting, “You never learned how to hold yourself when you fell.” You sink to your knees, the weight of the words crushing, the rain acidic. You want to cry, but your tears evaporate before they can fall.  

And then—a sound.  

A low, resonant hum, like the vibration of a cello string stretched taut across the universe. A figure emerges from the storm, their silhouette glowing with a soft, golden haze. They have no face, only a cascade of light, and when they speak, it’s in the language of your own heartbeat. “*You cannot pour from an empty vessel,*” they say, pressing a hand to your chest. Where they touch, warmth blooms, spreading like roots through cracked soil.  

The cage around the child shatters. The fireflies reignite, their light spilling over you in waves. You crawl to the child, cradling them, and the quicksand solidifies into smooth, cool stone. The forest begins to dissolve, its thorns retracting into petals of indigo and gold. The mirror shatters, but the shards don’t fall—they float upward, becoming birds with wings of stained glass.  

The faceless figure kneels beside you. “Self-compassion is not a shield,” they murmur, their voice the rustle of leaves in a long-forgotten summer. “It is the ground beneath your feet. It is the hand you offer yourself when you stumble. It is the breath that reminds you: you are still here.”  

The child in your arms grows lighter, their soot-streaked face softening into sleep. You feel something unfurling in your chest—a warmth, a weightlessness, as though your ribs have become a cradle for the sun. The inverted forest rights itself, trees plunging into the earth, sky blooming into dawn.  

When you wake, the scent of burnt lavender lingers. But beneath it, faint and sweet, is the memory of firelight—proof that even in the deepest dark, you learned to tend the flame.
