I am dreaming. You drift into a moonlit forest whose trees hum softly, their silver leaves whispering secrets. Each step you take sinks into moss that glows faintly beneath your bare feet. In the distance, a figure stands at the edge of a clearing: someone you trust deeply. Their silhouette shimmers as though made of shifting water, and when they speak your name it echoes oddly—first gentle and warm, then just a hair too flat, too rehearsed.  

At first you’re enchanted by that voice, by the way the moonlight dances off the figure’s hair, but soon a prickle of doubt stirs in your chest. You notice that every time you reach for a branch overhead, the path behind you subtly reshapes itself—broader, then narrower, as though guiding you exactly where the figure wishes. You pause. Your reflection shivers in a pool beside you: your face looks uncertain.  

As you step forward, the clearing’s floor ripples, and suddenly you’re inside a mirrored hall. A thousand versions of your friend flank you, each one mouthing the same compliment, the same gentle persuasion: “Trust me. You’re overthinking.” Their smiles grow uncomfortably wide, their eyes glinting with something cool and artificial. You feel the pull to nod, to acquiesce, but your own reflection inches backward, shaking its head.  

In that instant, you realize: these reflections are not you. They are borrowed fragments, twisted and polished. Your heart pounds. Drawing a trembling breath, you lift a hand and touch one of the mirrors. It quivers, then cracks. The glass splinters in slow motion, rainbows flaring where truth fractures deception. One by one, the other mirrors crack too, each fracture line exposing emptiness behind the surface.  

Now the clearing is bathed in fierce white light. The forest hushes. The figure before you is no longer fluid but solid and small—an echo no stronger than a shadow. You step toward them and speak with calm conviction: “I see the pattern shifting. I feel my own shape, unbent.” Your words, once swallowed by mirrors, now ring clear against the trunks of tall, silent trees.  

The echoes of manipulation dissolve like mist. You feel your spine straighten, your heart settle into its own rhythm. The silver leaves above still hum, but now they carry only your song—a melody of self-trust. As dawn’s first rosy rays slip between the branches, you awaken, carrying with you the crystal-clear knowledge that your boundaries are your own—and that no mirror, no matter how polished, can bend your truth without your consent.
