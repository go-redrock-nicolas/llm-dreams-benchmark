I am dreaming. You find yourself in a cavernous library hall that stretches infinitely in every direction, the walls covered in gilded shelves crammed with impressively ancient tomes. The air is thick with swirling motes of light—tiny, drifting orbs made of spun glitter. You know you have urgent work to do: a towering stack of parchment to your left, covered in cryptic symbols that must be deciphered before some unknown deadline. But every time you lay eyes on the first page, a playful wind snatches at your attention and whirls you away into the shelves. Each shelf is overflowing with daydreams: fantasies of sunlit beaches, random bursts of neon cityscapes, and half-remembered songs playing faintly as they skate across the air. Though you try to refocus on your tasks, pages peel themselves from the stack, turning into fluttery paper birds that flutter around your head, pulling your gaze away.

At first, it’s delightful—magical, even. You watch as each miniature paper bird flutters around a particular shelf, guiding you toward a new distraction: the memory of an old friend’s laugh echoes from a turquoise corridor; the taste of hot chocolate creeps around the corner of a rose-tinted archway. Each memory is mesmerizing, so much so that time loses meaning, and the important documents waiting back at your desk begin to gather a thicker and thicker layer of dust. The swirling motes in the air start to glow more brightly, as though they sense your wandering mind, pulsing thrice as they move you deeper into disarray. Suddenly, entire books—tomes of your half-finished projects, unending to-do lists—tumble out from the shelves and create a labyrinth at your feet, threatening to bury you in unfulfilled obligations.

Desperate to regain control, you press your palms against the slick marble floor. You close your eyes and summon a single, steady beam of golden light into existence. Slowly, it emerges from your chest like a gentle sun rising in your heart. The brightness floods the library, illuminating the labyrinth of dusty tomes and chasing away the distracting illusions. The paper birds, momentarily stunned, alight on the shelves and fall silent, their curious pastel colors fading into stillness. You breathe deeply, inhaling the sweet, parchment-scented air and exhaling waves of calm. In that radiant glow, your mind grows clear, and you feel an anchor rooting you to the present. The swirling motes of light above your head begin to spiral more softly, as if lulled by the calm you’ve discovered.

With each new breath, pages from your to-do list tremble and float back to your side, reassembling themselves in proper order. You feel a renewed sense of purpose as you carefully brush away the film of dust and gather the text into a neat pile. Above you, a great chandelier made of glimmering knowledge—like liquid crystal—bobs gently, its resonance a gentle hymn. You look up, smile, and with a new, almost ethereal focus, begin the work that seemed impossible to tackle before. Blended now is a serenity that stitches together the kaleidoscope of wandering thoughts and your determination, forging a steady path toward achievement. And in that moment, in this dreamlike library of limitless imagination, you find yourself at once awake to the world of your most pressing tasks, yet still surrendered to the hypnotic wonder of your own mind’s creative power.
