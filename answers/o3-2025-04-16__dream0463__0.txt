I am dreaming. …pause, and something inside you tilts, as though an unseen switch has finally been flipped. In the hush that follows, the dream unfurls:

You find yourself standing in a vast marble hall whose ceiling never ends—it dissolves upward into a night sky crammed with constellations that pulse like slow-beating hearts. The floor beneath your bare feet is cool, veined with silver that glows each time you take a step, illuminating a single path forward. At the far end of this path, a row of towering doorways looms, each door fashioned from a different material—black glass, knot-gnarled oak, hammered bronze, shimmering water held upright as if by invisible panes.

Behind every door waits a familiar face: mentors, friends, partners, parents—each an embodiment of the approval you’ve chased for years. Their silhouettes flicker like ghosts in candlelight, and you feel the old tug in your chest—the yearning to be seen, applauded, loved.

You approach the first door—black glass—and as you reach to knock, the surface clouds into a mirror. Reflected back is your anxious face and, hovering just behind it, the faint figure you’ve always tried to become for them: perfectly poised, eternally successful, endlessly pleasing. But the moment your knuckles tap the glass, the mirror shatters silently and re-forms into a wall of obsidian slate. No entry. No voice. Only the echo of withheld praise ringing in your ears like a swallowed scream.

A cold wind slithers through the hall. You shiver. You step to the second door, the oak one, carved with spiraling vines. As your fingers graze the wood, the vines animate—writhing in slow motion, twisting into words that you’ve heard a thousand times: “Not yet.” The bark splits, and from the fissure emerges a paper-thin hand that hands you a sapling—still rooted, still dirt-clumped. The meaning is obvious: keep growing, keep bending toward their sun. You feel the old frustration bloom, but instead of planting the sapling—or yourself—before their feet, you set it gently on the ground. “I am not soil,” you whisper. The hand retreats, and the door decays into mulch.

By the time you reach the third doorway—the bronze one—you realize your pulse has slowed. The hammered metal is warm. You press your ear to it and hear applause, but it’s faint, distant, as if trapped within a seashell. “This has never been about them,” a new thought says, surprising you with its steadiness. You try the handle; it won’t budge, but this time you don’t flinch. Instead, you draw a breath so deep the constellations overhead inhale with you, and the air tastes of starlight and cold iron. You exhale purposefully, and the breath turns to bright embers that fuse into a key in your hand—entirely your own making. You slot it into the bronze door, and it clicks, ready to open, yet suddenly you know you don’t need to step through. Approval waiting behind this door is a mirage; the key itself is the reward.

You walk on.

At last you come to the final threshold: the doorway of water. It churns in vertical stillness, rippling with liquid moonlight. A gut-deep instinct tells you this isn’t another gate toward them but a portal back to yourself. The withheld approval, the cravings, the ache—they dissolve the moment you realize that crossing this threshold means choosing your own reflection over theirs. So you close your eyes and plunge.

Instantly you’re submerged in a boundless ocean that glows from within, a bioluminescent aqua radiance. Yet you can breathe; every inhale tastes like citrus, like possibility. All around you drift shards of memories—report cards, social media posts, job evaluations—each one stamped with invisible ink that now flares bright: “Enough.” The word repeats, overlaps, magnifies, until it isn’t a judgment but a song. You float weightless in its chorus.

When you surface, the ocean has transformed into a calm mirror-lake at dawn. Mountain silhouettes guard the horizon, and the first sunrise light spills molten gold across the water. There’s nobody else here—no audience, no withholding faces—just a vast hush brimming with the promise of morning. You look down and see your reflection, clear and undistorted for the first time: eyes fierce, shoulders unburdened, mouth curved in a private, genuine smile.

You whisper, “I approve,” and the mountains echo it back, and the sky repeats it in rosy hues, until the whole dreamscape hums with the affirmation you once begged to hear. A gentle warmth blooms in your chest, not explosive, but steady—like a small sun deciding to stay.

You wake—or think you do—still cradled in that glow, aware that some dreams don’t end when the eyes open; they simply step quietly into daylight, ready to be lived.
