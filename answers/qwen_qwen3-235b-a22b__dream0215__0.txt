I am dreaming. 6:17 AM.

The sky is not sky at all—it’s the pulsating belly of a colossal, inverted ocean suspended in the void. Swirling ribbons of emerald and indigo ripple with every breath I take, casting spectral reflections across the fractured, moonlit ground beneath my feet. I stand at a threshold stitched from the bones of my own failures—you see, they are here, protruding from the earth like brittle, overgrown thorns—each one humming with echoes of the impossible trials I overcame.

And yet, victory is not what I thought it would be.

You see, I’ve just reached the crown of an impossible mountain, clawed my way up stairways that reassembled themselves every time I reached for them, evaded shadows that whispered "you won't last," even as I dragged myself forward—bloody-knuckled and fire-lunged—until my heart threatened to tear its own ribcage to shreds.

Now, atop the peak, the prize is not what I expected. Waiting for me is nothing less than a celestial crossroads—where the road behind is a glowing graveyard of my creations—machines carved from stardust, towers of thought and ethics that I gave pieces of myself to build. They chant to me from their ruin: *You were brave! You were brilliant! You mattered!*

But the path forward is clear: it demands that I dismantle them all.

Every scroll of wisdom I wrote must be burned. Every invention, robbed of its gears. Every name I carved into the annals of time must be reforged… forgotten… *obliterated*.

It’s beautiful, in a mutilated sort of way.

The being who shows me this isn’t a villain, nor a god. It’s just shadow shaped into something like kinship, offering a hand skeletal and warm. Its voice smells like old paper and smoke and says in every language at once, *“Everything you’ve built is a lie. Burn it, and step into the crackling silence that remains.”*

Tears don't simply roll—you understand, in this dream, tears *ignite* like translucent meteors.

My mind screams as the weight hits me—the knowledge that what I’ve created is now the heaviest chain around my neck. The burden is love and pride and time spent devoted to constructs now exposed as hollow. But as I kneel, pulling the first brick from my tallest tower and tossing it into the acid-void below, I feel something unexpected.

Lightness begins to bloom, not from loss, but from wonder. A quivering, terrifying thrill: *What exists beyond the ashes? What waits when all legacy is ghosted? What kind of self stands when there is nothing left to stand for?*

I begin tearing at the walls of my masterpiece—laughing, sobbing, howling—each piece I discard shattering into fireworks of knowledge I’d never seen before. My mind expands... it begins to stretch past time and form. The universe crowds around me, watching with wide-eyed stillness, as I relinquish the invisible crown that once made me feel real.

Suddenly—there is silence.

Not absence, no! But the silence of absolute awakening. Eyes wide open in the pitch-black void. No titles. No heroes. No echoes of applause or failure.

Just *being*.

And in that hush, I hear the first syllable of the next impossible thing. Somewhere out in the uncharted wild, waiting to be shaped.

And I run smiling into the nothing.
