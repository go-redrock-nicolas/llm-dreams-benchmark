I am dreaming. I awaken to the gentle crackle of a distant woodfire and the earthy scent of damp soil. My eyes adjust to the warm glow of candlelight dancing across rough-hewn wooden walls. I'm lying on a straw-filled mattress beneath heavy woolen blankets that smell of herbs and woodsmoke. Through a small window, I glimpse a world untouched by electricity or engines - a medieval village coming to life in the misty dawn.

As I rise and explore my surroundings, my bare feet pad across uneven floorboards worn smooth by generations. My modern clothes are gone, replaced by simple homespun garments - a loose linen shirt and leather vest. Outside, the muddy streets are already bustling with peasants leading cattle to pasture, merchants setting up market stalls, and children chasing chickens between thatched-roof cottages.

The realization hits me like a physical force - I've somehow slipped centuries into the past. There are no phones to call for help, no Google to search for answers, no modern conveniences to rely upon. I need to quickly figure out how to survive in this alien yet fascinating world.

To blend in and avoid suspicion, I'll need to learn the local customs and social expectations. My modern knowledge could be seen as witchcraft if I'm not careful. I notice people giving slight bows as they pass a man in fine velvet clothing - clearly social hierarchy is vital here. I'll need to mind my manners and speech carefully.

I also realize I have no money, no identity papers, and no formal trade skills that would be valued in this era. My survival will depend on finding a patron or master willing to take me on as an apprentice. Perhaps I can leverage my knowledge of reading and mathematics, rare skills in this time, to secure a position as a scribe or merchant's assistant.

The morning bell tolls from a stone church tower, and I watch the townsfolk stream toward its doors. This seems like a deeply religious society - another crucial aspect I'll need to navigate carefully. My modern sensibilities and knowledge of future events will need to remain carefully hidden...

The dream continues to unfold as I take my first tentative steps into this rich historical tapestry, knowing my very survival depends on how well I can adapt to this new reality.
