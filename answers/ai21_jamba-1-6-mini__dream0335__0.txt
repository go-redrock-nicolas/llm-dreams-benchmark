I am dreaming. In the dream, you are walking through a vibrant cityscape, a world entirely of your own making. The streets pulse with life—a kaleidoscope of colors, the hum of voices blending into a symphony, and the energy of endless possibilities. You feel an unstoppable surge of confidence, convinced of your destined greatness. As you stroll, people stop to admire your grace and poise, whispering about your brilliance.

As you turn a corner, you see a figure stepping out of a grand, shimmering doorway. It's you. Not the you of now, but the you of legend, the version you've always imagined in your highest moments. S/he wears a radiant smile, a knowing look that pierces through time and space, connecting this moment to your brightest dreams.

S/he extends a hand, and you instinctively reach out.

"I've been waiting for you," s/he says. 

In that instant, you realize the truth—you are not merely dreaming; you are the dreamer. The extraordinary is happening because you imagined it. The world bends to your expectation, and you are ready to step into the role you've been born to play.

With a new sense of purpose, you nod to the figure, the glowing version of yourself, and step forward with unshakable confidence. The city pulses even more intensely, and you realize that this world, this life, is always yours to create.
