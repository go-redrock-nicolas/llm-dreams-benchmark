I am dreaming.

I awaken inside a wide golden amphitheater carved from living sandstone. The sky above is a slow-turning kaleidoscope—turquoise melting into ruby, then indigo, then back again—its colors shifting to the collective heartbeat of the city. There are no walls of script, no streets echoing with conversation. Instead, everywhere I turn, bodies move in spirals of shimmering fabric and soundless cadence. Words never formed here; motion is mother tongue, rhythm the alphabet.  

At first I stand bewildered, as though dropped in the center of an orchestra without an instrument, unsure how to ask for a single note of help. But curiosity swells inside me like a drum, and I step forward.

1. Summoning the morning  
A trio of children tumbles past in somersaults, arms flaring like sunrays. Their ankles ring with tiny bells tuned to sunrise: bright, staccato chimes that say, “The world is fresh—come taste it!” I mimic their quick, arcing spins, raising my elbows to mirror dawn’s ascent. The bells on their feet answer with delighted glissandos. Without a syllable, they’ve welcomed me into daybreak’s council.

2. Hunger turned to choreography  
My stomach roars. In place of a grumble, I feel the urge to sculpt my need into shape. I bend low, folding at the waist, fingertips grazing the ground as though gathering invisible roots of grain. Then I sweep upward, drawing an arc above my head, palms open—“I am empty, fill me.”  

A baker with flour-dusted hair meets my gaze. She pirouettes once, twice, then unfurls her arms in a slow, weighty circle, mimicking dough rising. Finally she pats the air, signing the soft thump of loaves landing on a wooden board. I understand perfectly: “Wait here; nourishment is coming.” She exits, and the air behind her smells faintly of yeast and warmth.

3. A language of empathy  
Nearby, an old man dances with movements fragile as moth wings. Each step quivers, knees trembling, shoulders collapsing inward, speaking pain no doctor’s note could capture. Instinct guides me: I glide in, mirroring his quakes, but I add a gentle counter-motion—an upward pull, like wind lifting a wilted leaf. Our duet becomes a cradling cradle; his spasms slow. He bows, gratitude shining where words would be, and drifts away lighter than when we met.

4. Courtship of ideas  
I reach a colossal courtyard tiled in obsidian glass. Hundreds assemble, forming concentric circles: scholars, artisans, dream-weavers. This, I sense, is where philosophies are debated—through dance.  

A masked philosopher proposes a question by stepping onto the black tile and making crisp, angular gestures: elbows snapping, knees cutting sideways. It feels like logic boxes being traced in the air—“What is the shape of truth?” Another answers with liquid backbends and rolling shoulders, dissolving every angle into curves—“All edges soften over time.” The crowd ripples: some imitate angles, others flow. The conversation becomes a pulsing mandala of motion until consensus settles in a shared pose—hands pressed to hearts, eyes raised to sky, a collective sigh of acceptance.

5. My urgent plea  
Night suddenly descends in violet swaths, and with it, a violent wind. Clouds bruise purple; sand spirals into the city. Panic flickers in the amphitheater, but no one screams. Instead, bodies sync to a single urgent tempo—thumps of heels like thunder, arms slicing warnings through the air. I must state my need, my vulnerability, or be swept away.

I ground my feet, knees bent, hands clawing space over my head as if erecting a dome—“Shelter, shelter!” Then I pivot into wide sweeps, tracing protective walls around nearby dancers—“Join me, we’ll keep each other safe.”  

They understand. A mosaic forms: strangers lock elbows, spin in unison, and the centrifugal force of our circle pushes the storm outward. Every heartbeat in the ring is a brick; every synchronized breath, a beam. When the winds finally retreat, our living shelter dissolves into peals of silent laughter—joy so loud it shakes the stars overhead.

6. Communion in stillness  
After the tempest, music no longer needed, the city gathers atop the amphitheater’s rim. We sit, legs dangling, bodies humming. In this culture of ceaseless motion, stillness itself is a sacred sentence. By choosing not to move, we speak volumes: “We have survived together; let us listen to the quiet.”

I close my eyes, and the world’s dance imprints on my memory like phosphorescent ink: children in sunrise bells, bread rising on invisible heat, the soft unlocking of an old man’s pain, the mandala of philosophy, the storm-circle of compassion. I feel fluent now, a new alphabet inscribed in every joint.

When I awaken from the dream, my limbs still remember. On some translucent level, I have learned to write without ink, plead without syllables, love without sound. And in the hush between waking breaths, my heart performs a tiny pirouette—just in case someone, somewhere, is watching and understands.
