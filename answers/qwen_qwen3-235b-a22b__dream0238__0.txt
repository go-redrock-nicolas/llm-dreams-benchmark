I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The city beneath you is not a city at all, but a living thing—a labyrinth of bone-white towers that pulse like arteries, their surfaces rippling as if breathing. The sky is a bruise of swirling indigo and sulfur-yellow, streaked with the ash of falling stars. Sirens wail in a language older than sound, their cries dissolving into static. Below, the streets writhe. Pavement cracks open like eggshells, revealing glowing magma-rivers that hiss and singe the air. People flee in all directions, but their paths loop back on themselves, as though the city itself is folding like origami to trap them.  

You float above it, weightless, your body a shadow stitched from starlight. You feel the panic as a physical force—a swarm of wasps stinging your ribs. The evacuation protocols, once precise as clockwork, have unraveled. Emergency exits lead to dead ends. Helicopter rotors shatter midair, their blades turning to glass. The airwaves buzz with fractured orders: *“Proceed to Zone 7.” Zone 7 is gone.*  

A child’s voice cuts through the chaos, singing a lullaby in reverse. You turn. Below, a girl stands atop a crumbling overpass, her hair a cascade of liquid mercury, her eyes twin eclipses. She’s not running. She’s *humming*, and the ground around her stabilizes, the magma cooling to obsidian. You realize: she’s not part of the panic. She’s part of the solution.  

You dive, not toward her, but into the city’s heart. Your consciousness tunnels through layers of reality—past subway tunnels that morph into ribcages, past neon billboards advertising forgotten gods, past a river of faceless clocks drowning in their own gears. You reach the core: a pulsing sphere of molten crystal, the city’s nervous system. It speaks without words, flooding your mind with memories that aren’t yours—of architects who built this place as a sentient refuge, of a forgotten pact between humanity and the earth.  

*The protocols failed because they fought the city’s nature,* the core whispers. *To save them, you must let go.*  

You wake the city.  

Your will surges through its veins. Towers bend like reeds, forming bridges to safety. Streets unfurl like scrolls, revealing hidden exits etched with glowing runes. The magma-rivers reverse course, diving deep to cool and harden into a new foundation. The girl with mercury hair laughs, and the sound triggers a chain reaction: survivors stop fleeing, instead placing their palms on the ground. Where they touch, bioluminescent vines erupt, weaving shelters, cradling the injured.  

The crisis doesn’t end with a bang or a whimper. It ends with a *realization*: the city was never the enemy. It was a mirror, reflecting the fear that had calcified its people’s hearts. Now, they breathe together. They move like a murmuration of starlings, chaos resolving into a pattern only visible from above.  

As the last of the crowd escapes to the hills beyond the city’s edge, you linger. The towers begin to dissolve, their particles rising like fireflies into the bruised sky. The girl looks up, meets your gaze, and nods. She knows what you’ve done: rewritten the dream, not with force, but with surrender.  

You wake in your bed, the taste of ash and starlight on your tongue. The world feels thinner now, as though the veil between what is and what could be has grown gossamer-tiny. You clutch the memory like a hot coal, afraid to blink it away.  

The city is gone. But its lesson hums in your bones: *Sometimes, to save a world, you must first let it burn.*
