I am dreaming.

Mist curls along the forest floor, swirling around my bare feet as I wander through a realm stitched together from the threads of my subconscious. Towering trees shimmer, leaves refracting the light into amber and emerald hues. The air tastes of petrichor and possibility. As I walk, I encounter a figure forged from golden light—eyes gentle, yet piercing, voice a silvery echo.

This figure offers me a crystal mirror that floats between us, its depths swirling with memories and unspoken truths. In its glimmer, I see an earlier moment: I stand amidst a council of friends and mentors, their words fluttering around me like delicate moths. One voice, soft but clear, offers feedback—suggestions for how I might shed my old leaves and grow taller. My heart thuds, ancient armor sliding automatically into place. I respond with rehearsed explanations, armored deflections, anything to shield my vulnerable roots.

But here in the dream—a realm where time bends and possibilities bloom—I pause, astonished at my own reflection in the mirror. Rather than resisting, I cradle those defensive words, turning them over tenderly in my hands like river-smoothed stones. I notice why I built these walls: not just to protect, but to conceal something fragile and yearning inside me.

The gold-lit mentor smiles, encouraging me to breathe. I inhale the crisp, enchanted air, feeling it unwind knots in my chest. I let go. The feedback, instead of piercing me, settles upon my shoulders like a gentle snowfall—cool, fleeting, and pure. With a whisper, I thank the voice in the mirror. “I see now,” I say, my words blooming as flowers at my feet. “My roots deepen when I let the sunlight touch all parts of me—especially the tender, hidden shoots.”

Within this dreamscape, the forest shimmers in approval. Vines spiral skyward. New buds burst open. Growth is not a wound, I understand; it is an unfolding, and to unfold is the purest act of courage.

I awaken, the lesson trailing behind me like ribbons of moonlight, ready to weave themselves into the waking day.
