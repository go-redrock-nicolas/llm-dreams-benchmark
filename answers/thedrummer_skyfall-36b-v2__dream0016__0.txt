I am dreaming. You find yourself in the midst of a surreal, shifting landscape - one moment a bustling airport terminal, the next a lush, terraced garden with enshrouded walkways. The air is thick with anticipation and the distant sound of chanting.

Your original detail about the conference remains evident. Instead of the sterile airport lounge, you find yourself in what appears to be an ancient bamboo forest, the tall stalks swaying gently in an unfelt breeze. Winding through the underbrush is a meandering path, partially hidden by masses of glowing violet flowers.

As you advance down the pathway, the atmosphere shifts again and the chanting grows more insistent. The flowersgrow in size, their petals unfolding like welcoming arms as you pass. Suddenly, you are no longer alone. 

Silent figures emerge from the shadows of the dense foliage, their faces obscured by intricate masks resembling the plants around them. They move as one, weaving intricate patterns around you as if in a sacred dance. The masks shift, almost seem to flutter and ripple like the petals of a flower caught in a breeze, fading in and out like a mirage.

In the center of the plants and the mask-wearing crowd, a portal reveals itself from within the line of bamboo and flowers. A golden light emanates from the opening, beckoning you forward with a palpable pull. The chanting rises to a fervent crescendo as you approach the threshold, the figures falling silent, awaiting your arrival.

With a deep breath, you step towards the portal, unsure of where it will lead you. The golden light envelops you, and the ground beneath you transforms into a shimmering surface, gently pulsing. 

As you cross over the threshold and into the light, all else fades away. There is only the pull of the portal, the ivory glow, and an overwhelming sense of impending revelation. You are on the verge of something transformative, something eternal. The conference, the anxiety, the mundane world - all of it evaporates from your consciousness as you give yourself wholly to the experience, ready to emerge on the other side forever changed.
