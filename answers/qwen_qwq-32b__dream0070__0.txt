I am dreaming. I am thrust into a diplomatic role representing my country at a summit with historical enemies.  As tensions rise during negotiations, I... 

A chilly mist clings to the edges of the amber-lit chamber, swirling like the unresolved history between us. The air hums with the weight of unsaid words, each delegate’s breath visible in the frigid silence. My nation’s flag—a phoenix rising over stormy waves—flutters lifelessly in the corner, as though even it doubts my ability to kindle peace.

The table is an octagon of polished obsidian, its surface reflecting not our faces, but the scars of our ancestors’ battles: the Great Siege of Azure Bay, the Betrayal at Midnight Pass. Across from me sit delegates from the Iron Dominion, their dark uniforms sharp as bayonets. Their leader, General Veyra, taps her fingers on the table in a rhythm that matches the distant drumroll of my heartbeat. Her eyes, glittering like dirk blades, fix on mine. She leans forward, her voice a knife through fog: “Your so-called ‘safeguards’ will only breed new avenues for subterfuge.”

I open my mouth, but before words form, the chamber trembles. The ceiling fractures, as expected—a meteorAn attack—but it’s neither. Instead, the sky splits open to reveal a inverted waterfall: a colossal stream of liquid starlight cascading downward, igniting the stones into luminous sand. The delegates gasp; their figures blur, transforming mid-scream into spectral stags, their antlers branching like shattered crystal. The General stiffens, her uniform unraveling to reveal not flesh, but pulsating veins of amethyst and onyx.

The table lifts, now a levitating disc suspended in the new cosmic chasm above us. A voice, like the sigh of collapsing stars, murmurs, *“The old pacts were forged in fire. Now, they must be written in light.”*

My staff materializes in my hands—a spiraled branch of iridescent wood, its tip aflame with a flameless fire. Around me, the delegates have become constellations of discontented, howling spirits. To my left, a towering crane with feathers of rusted daggers flicks its beak; to my right, what I once knew as Ambassador Toren stares with hollow eyes, his form weaving through the air like smoke from an extinguished hearth.

The Iron Dominion’s General—now a stallion of living shadow, its mane a cascade of shattered mirrors—charges. Its hooves strike the obsidian table, sending shockwaves that fracture my nation’s flag into a thousand shards. Each fragment hovers, melting into liquid gold before pooling into a shimmering bowl. I grasp the staff firmly, its warmth seeping into my palm, and pour the molten light onto the cracked surface of the table.

The liquid spreads, tracing lines that glow like nerves. Maps of forgotten territories emerge, but they shift and pulse, rivers flowing backward and mountains blooming into floating islands. The stallion rears, its voice now a chorus of whispers: “You dare rewrite the rules of the game, little phoenix?”

I step onto the luminous bowl, and suddenly I am standing on the edge of a continent made of my country’s flag—a sea of crimson and indigo stretching into a sky that swirls with the/colors/of other worlds. The staff pulses, and I raise it, summoning a helix of intertwined storm and sunlight. It collides with the stallion’s charge, and the clash births a supernova of soundless energy. When the light clears, the spirits are still, their forms flickering between their old hatred and something unreadable, something fragile and new.

The voice returns, this time resonant and deep: *“The treaty must be sealed in a language beyond words… in a symbol that binds even shadows to light.”*

The bowl trembles, offering a hand-sized storm cloud with a nucleus of hardened starlight. I grip it tightly, the cold seeping into my bones, and hurl it toward the center of the table. It shatters on impact, releasing a resonance that feels like every silent apology ever unspoken. The ground shudders, and the delegates begin to shift again—this time, their forms merging with the glowing etchings on the table.

When I open my eyes, I’m back in the amber-lit chamber. The obsidian table now bears an intricate pattern: swirling galaxies interspersed with broken blades fused into bridges. The real General Veyra stares at it, her stern face unreadable, before muttering, “This changes…everything.” 

The mist outside has dissipated, replaced by dawn’s first light filtering through windows. My flag flutters proudly now, its phoenix sliced through with constellations. I touch my still-warm staff, now gone, and realize the dream isn’t over—it’s merely folded into the waking world, waiting to be unraveled.
