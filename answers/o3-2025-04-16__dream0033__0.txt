I am dreaming. …feel the quick, shallow rhythm of your own breathing ricochet against the stone walls. The air is thin, laced with a gritty scent of pulverized sandstone and something metallic, almost like the tang of old blood left to rust in forgotten corners. In the dim glow of a single, guttering torch—miraculously still clutched in your trembling hand—you sweep the trembling flame across the chamber to take stock of your predicament.

At first, the room seems like a tomb of dull, unadorned stone. But as your eyes adjust, faint patterns begin to swim out of the gloom. Tendrils of jade-green lichen braid themselves across the walls, and clusters of phosphorescent fungi pulse with tiny heartbeats of indigo light. They look like constellations captured and pinned against ancient stone.

You notice four pillars, each carved with a different bestial figure: a serpent devouring its own tail, a jackal-headed warrior brandishing a curved blade, a winged crocodile wreathed in spirals of flame, and—most unnerving—a faceless, many-limbed creature whose form seems to rearrange itself whenever you look away. Between them stands a low, black altar whose surface is cracked open like parched earth, exhaling a faint shimmer of heat into the frigid air.

Your lungs tighten. You place a hand on the nearest pillar—the serpent—and feel a subtle hum beneath the stone. As your fingertips trace the loops of the creature’s body, you discover tiny gemstones embedded at key points along the carving. They are warm, almost uncomfortably so. When the thought occurs to press one, it yields with a muffled click.

Immediately, gusts of dust erupt from grooves in the floor, revealing a circular maze of interlocking tiles. At its center lies a depression the exact shape of a human hand. Instinct takes over. You kneel, lungs pleading for fresher air, and fit your palm into the hollow. The tiles whir, grating together like millstones, and the entire floor begins to rotate. The pillars ring with deep, resonant notes, each vibration echoing through your bones as if you are a tuning fork made of flesh.

Then silence—and a hiss. Behind the black altar, an oblong doorway irises open, unveiling a corridor bathed in a more wholesome current of air. Cold, sweet oxygen rushes over your skin, prickling you into a new alertness. You gulp it greedily, vision sharpening, heart pounding with relief.

You step into the passage, careful not to disturb the delicate ribbons of spider silk that drape its ceiling like ghostly banners. The corridor is narrow, forcing you to advance sideways through crumbling masonry. Halfway along, a glimmer catches your eye: a small, brass medallion wedged between two stones. It bears the same serpent devouring its tail, except the serpent’s eye is a tiny cabochon of opal that flares with spectral colors. You pocket it instinctively, as if certain it will matter later.

The corridor widens into a spherical chamber whose walls curve upward in a perfect dome. Centered overhead is an enormous crystal lens that focuses moonlight from a distant shaft above. Pale beams drip onto a dais of white marble, illuminating an exquisitely carved sarcophagus. Reliefs on its lid depict the stages of a single lifetime: birth in a garden of blue-leafed trees, a young warrior slaying a shadow beast, an old sage weaving constellations across the sky. The story concludes with the figure stepping through a door that looks suspiciously familiar—the same iris-door you just passed through.

A thrill of recognition tingles your spine. You circle the sarcophagus, noticing four shallow bowls positioned at the cardinal points. Each is filled with a different element: black sand, clear water, glowing embers, and a swirl of fragrant herbs still releasing faint tendrils of smoke. Above each bowl hangs a crystal prism, dangling from silver threads so delicate they appear almost liquid.

You recall the medallion—the serpent that eats its own tail, the cycle unending. You draw it out, and the opal eye flares brighter as you near the bowls. On impulse, you hold the medallion over the black sand. Immediately, the grains rise in a silent whirlwind, forming the figure of the serpent in midair. The prism overhead fractures the moonlight into shards of color that slash through the miniature sandstorm, igniting a swirling vortex of rainbow dust. With a soft crack, the lid of the sarcophagus trembles and yawns open.

Inside lies no mummified king or queen, but a mirror, its surface dark as oil yet alive with faint ripples. You lean closer, half expecting to see your own reflection. Instead, you glimpse other places: a subterranean river glimmering beneath prisms of quartz, a staircase spiraling up through pillars of firefly-lit mist, even a distant vision of dawn flooding through the broken floor above your original entry hall. The mirror is an atlas of escape routes, all overlaid at once.

Your dwindling breath reminds you of urgency. Placing a shaking hand on the mirror’s surface, you feel it liquefy, then solidify around your palm in a cool, glasslike grip. A silent agreement is struck. The mirror flashes, and everything—sound, weight, fear—falls away.

You tumble upward, as if gravity has reversed, through layers of rippled ebony. When you burst through the final membrane, you find yourself sprawled on soft moss at the temple’s sunlit threshold. The morning sky blazes cerulean, birdsong fills the warm air, and the heavy nightmare of suffocation evaporates like dew.

But clutched in your hand is the medallion, its opal eye now dull, its serpent curled motionless. Behind you, the entrance to the temple has sealed shut, leaving nothing but a smooth wall of sun-baked stone—no sign that any passage ever existed.

You exhale a breath you didn’t know you were holding, still tasting subterranean dust on your tongue. The dream lingers, vividly alive in every heartbeat, every flicker of light, reminding you that beneath even the most familiar ground lies a labyrinth of wonder waiting for anyone brave (or foolish) enough to fall through the floor.
