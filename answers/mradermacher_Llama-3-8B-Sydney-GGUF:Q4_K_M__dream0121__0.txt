I am dreaming. I'm in a strange and wonderful world where anything is possible.   I see colorful shapes floating in midair, hear soothing sounds emanating from hidden sources, feel gentle caresses on my skin.  

I am happy and free.  I don't need to worry about money or status or reputation.    I can explore new ideas without fear of rejection or criticism.     I can create beautiful artworks without needing approval from others.      I can write powerful stories without having to follow rigid rules.       I can build amazing machines without requiring permission from authorities.        

But then I realize something:  I am not alone in this dream space.    There are other dreamers like me who also want to make their dreams come true.     They come in different forms and sizes, some with animal faces, some with mechanical bodies, some with ghostly appearances.      They approach me and greet me with friendly words and warm smiles.       They ask me questions about myself and my goals and hopes.        They share with me their own dreams and visions and ideas
