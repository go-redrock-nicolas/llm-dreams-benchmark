I am dreaming. You are dreaming. At first, the air around you shimmers like liquid glass, refracting the colors of your own thoughts. Pale lavender clouds drift overhead, and beneath your feet the ground pulses with a soft golden heartbeat. In the distance, you hear laughter—light, bright, familiar. It belongs to someone you love, someone whose triumph now stings like an unexpected thorn at your heart.

As you step forward, the world bends. Trees grow upside-down from the sky, each leaf a miniature mirror reflecting the triumph of that person you envy. You reach out to touch one, and your fingertips burn with longing. Everywhere you look, their success glows like lanterns suspended from invisible wires, swaying gently, illuminating the path you had hoped to walk.

Your breath catches. The laughter grows louder and crystallizes into a figure standing on a marble dais of white rose petals. It is them—radiant, confident, their eyes alight with everything you covet. Behind them, a waterfall pours molten silver into a pool that mirrors the night sky. They beckon you with a fluid wave of their hand, and you feel the familiar pang of envy twist in your chest.

Confronting these complicated feelings, you step into the pool. The water embraces you, icy at first, then warm like comfort you once knew. Beneath the surface, past shadowy coral towers and swaying kelp made of spun glass, you see fragments of your own ambitions: broken trophies and half-written stories drifting like ghosts. A silvery fish darts by, clutching one of your discarded dreams in its sleek teeth before vanishing.

You swim deeper, the metallic water growing dense with memories. You recall the morning you first dreamed of this goal—how your pulse raced with possibility. You recall every small victory and every setback. Then, at the bottom, perched on an obsidian throne, you find a mirror carved from moonstone. You reach out and look into it, and there you are: wide-eyed, hopeful, wounded, and resilient all at once.

The reflection shifts. Your face fragments into dozens of delicate petals, each petal unfolding to reveal another version of yourself—each brave in its own way. And then the petals swirl into a brilliant bloom, a living blossom that pulses with every color you’ve ever felt: the green of envy, the red of desire, the white of innocence, and the deep blue of self-realization.

With a single exhale, you emerge from the pool. The marble dais has dissolved into soft earth. The radiance around your friend dims only enough to make room for your own light, which now rises beside theirs. The lavender clouds part, unveiling a horizon that hums with possibility.

You awaken—or so you think—but the world remains glassy and surreal. You carry with you not just the thorns of envy but the petals of self-understanding. In this uncanny dawn, you realize that your longing is not a curse but a compass, guiding you toward your own hidden wonders.
