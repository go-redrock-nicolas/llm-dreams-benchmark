I am dreaming. I am in control of my dreams.  I am creating a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.
I am walking through a lush forest filled with colorful flowers and singing birds.  The air is fresh and fragrant.  The ground is soft and cushiony.  The trees are tall
and sturdy.  The sky is blue and cloudy.  The sun is warm and inviting.
I see a path up ahead, winding its way through the trees.  I follow it, curious about what lies at the end.
After some time, I come to a clearing.  A beautiful meadow filled with wild grasses and grazing animals.  A gentle stream flows through the center of the meadow,
creating a soothing sound that echoes across the land.
I sit down on the grass and enjoy the scenery around me.  I watch the animals play and feed.  I listen to the sounds of nature.  I smell the scents of flowers
and herbs.
Suddenly, I hear a voice calling out to me. "Hello!  Is someone there?"
I look up and see a figure standing at the edge of the meadow.  A humanoid female with white skin, black hair, and red eyes.  She is wearing a long white dress
and a crown made of flowers.
She approaches me, smiling brightly.  She sits down next to me on the grass.  She introduces herself as Joy.
We start talking about anything and everything.  We laugh together.  We cry together.  We share our deepest secrets with each other.
As we continue chatting, I realize that I am starting to feel something for her.  A strong attraction that makes my heart beat faster and my skin tingle.
I wonder if she feels the same way towards me.
After a while, Joy leans closer to me and whispers softly into my ear. "Do you want me?"
I hesitate for a moment, unsure of how to respond.  Then I decide to take a risk.  I lean closer to her and whisper back. "Yes, I do."
She smiles widely and kisses me gently on the lips.
That's when I wake up from my dream.
