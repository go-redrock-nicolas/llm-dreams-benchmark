I am dreaming. **But not just any dream.**  

It begins in a city that doesn't exist, yet feels terribly familiar—a place stitched together from childhood memories and half-remembered myths, built on the bones of forgotten gods. Towers spiral into the sky like frozen whirlpools, their facades made of mirrors and bone. Streets twist in impossible spirals, forming Möbius loops that force you to always keep walking forward, supposedly toward salvation. No birds above, only silver kites with no strings, gliding in silent perpetual flight.

The colors are not quite real—they shimmer as if reality is uncertain of itself, as though the dream knows it shouldn't exist and yet pushes forward in quiet rebellion. Rain falls without clouds. The drops are warm, and they dissolve like whispers on the skin, carrying fragments of old voices—some are mine, some are others', all are unplaceable.

This is the City of Severed Beginnings, I realize.

And I, the dream-walker, am sitting at a café made of floating glass and stormlight, drinking honeyed tea that tastes of forgotten joys and unfinished love letters. I am worn—but not broken. Not yet.

**I have rebuilt my life five times.**  

First, in the ashes of betrayal that left me alone at twenty, heart crackling like dry leaves under stiletto heels and deceitful kindness.

Then, on the banks of madness, where whispered voices and sleepless nights tried to drown me after the second collapse—when ambition curdled into poison and I became my own villain.

Third, beneath the red skies of a foreign land, torn apart at the seams by exile, poverty, and the ache of silence too loud to withstand.

Fourth, under a mountain of grief, weighted down by funeral hymns and cold hands letting go, teaching me how to love ghosts.

Fifth—a wild rebirth under neon skies, stitched together with chaos theory, internet cafes, and stolen time—only to be shattered a final time, this time not by disaster nor trauma nor loss... but by indifference. By the fading belief in myself.  

And now, the collapse comes again. This time like a velvet black tide rising beneath the city, swallowing streetlamps, doors, time. It licks at the foundation of everything, not with rage—but with quiet certainty. There will be nothing left.

So I watch.

At the café, two children with eyes like polished obsidian sell memories in seashells. They recognize me and send a cup of warm salted coffee to my table without a word. Faces shift behind mine in the glass—as if other versions of me sip with me. Five. Five lives still burning behind my skin.

From the horizon comes a shriek—not metallic, not biological—but sonic, like language unraveling. A colossal figure made of shredded parchment and fire advances from the northern edge of the dream. Each step erases a building, a past, a dream.

**The End-Herald is here.**

It turns to me.

But I am not afraid.

I **sigh**, not in defeat—but in **clarity**.

And I **rise**.

I leap from my table into the rising black tide. It does not drown me. It catalyzes me. From its void, I begin to build—not reconstruct, not mimic—but **remake**. That which dies five times never truly dies. It **evolves**.

I forge a city from the heartbeats of all I've lost.

A city **born from endings**.

Its spires are made of all my heartbreaks, gleaming silver with a core that pulses with every wound. Gates open that lead not to safety—but to wonder. To truth.

The End-Herald halts, as if sensing that this collapse was not resignation... but initiation.

So here I stand, drowning in the end.

And **thriving** in the dark.  

Because I am not dying.

I am building again.

For the sixth time.  

Not to survive.

But to **transcend**.
