I am dreaming. …and shifting glyphs that seem to drift and change in the corner of your vision, as though the box itself is breathing. When you slide your fingertips along its surface, the wood—if it is wood—warms beneath your touch, releasing a faint aroma reminiscent of petrichor and distant campfires.

You feel the curious tug of gravity loosen; the horizon wobbles, and suddenly you stand at the center of a circular chamber formed from moonlit glass. Each wall mirrors infinity, reflecting you, the box, and a thousand versions of both in shimmering layers. Above, constellations swirl like a cosmic kaleidoscope. Below, an ocean of soft, velvet clouds rises and falls in silent tides.

You look back at the box. Where a seamless lid once rested, an almost invisible seam now glows silver. Small shapes emerge within the carvings—tiny doors, spiraling staircases, miniature trees bending in imaginary breezes. Every etched detail is its own living world, expanding and contracting like fractals. The longer you stare, the more you sense a quiet symphony: flute-like tones, distant heartbeats, the hush of raven wings.

You press your thumb to the soft glow at the center. A heartbeat later, the seam widens and the lid unfurls like the petals of a midnight flower. Yet instead of revealing an interior, it opens onto a scene: a rooftop garden suspended high above cities unknown, where vines bear crystal fruit that chime in the wind. A perfumed breeze sighs out of the box, weaving through your hair.

Instinct guides you. With a single step, you pass through the lid, becoming weightless. The ground beneath transforms into sky; sky into mosaic floor. You stand in that rooftop garden you glimpsed. Each crystal fruit holds swirling galaxies, and with every breath you feel stardust ignite in your lungs—cool, effervescent, exhilarating.

In the distance lies a silver gate, half-hidden by climbing roses whose petals shift colors with your thoughts. Etched on its archway are the same patterns that once adorned the box. You understand without understanding: the box was never a container, but a doorway into a story that will write itself as you walk.

And so, with footsteps light as scattered petals, you venture toward the gate—ready to learn what secrets dreamworlds confide only to the curious, and what wonders lie beyond locked doors that exist solely to be unimagined open.
