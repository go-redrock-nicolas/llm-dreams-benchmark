I ignore them and focus on the task at hand. I use my imagination and intuition to create something unique and original. I experiment with new ideas and concepts.
I take risks and embrace failure as a learning opportunity.

As I work, I feel a sense of wonder and curiosity. I find hidden connections between different fields of knowledge. I uncover unexpected solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems.

Then they start to applaud. Not just a few people but everyone in the room claps and cheers for me. They recognize the brilliance and innovation of my creation.

I bask in their approval and adulation. I accept their compliments and praise with humility and gratitude.
