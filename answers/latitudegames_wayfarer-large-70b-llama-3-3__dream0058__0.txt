I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a dimly lit, cavernous meeting room, the walls stretching far above me into darkness. The long, polished oak table before me should be bustling with team members, but instead it sits ominously empty except for one laptop opened to a project timeline. Dread creeps over me as I realize half of my essential team has vanished without notice.

Frantically, I search the room, but each corner I turn reveals only shadows and silence. The pressure of an unchanged deadline looms before me like an executioner's axe. I pace the empty space, my footsteps echoing off the walls as I try to conjure solutions from thin air.

As if in response to my growing panic, the lights flicker and fail, plunging me into total darkness. I hear the distinct click of a door shutting somewhere nearby, trapping me in this void. Voices begin to whisper from all directions, each one a former team member offering fragmentary excuses for their departure.

With heart racing, I force myself to remain calm and think. The laptop screen casts an eerie glow across my face as I begin rapidly typing out contingency plans and desperate recruitment pleas. The device transforms into an ancient typewriter in my hands, each key press resulting in a shower of sparks and smoke.

Suddenly, the room shifts and reorganizes. Desks materialize around me, each one occupied by faceless mannequins. As I watch in horror, their blank heads turn toward me one by one, expressing impossible expectations with hollow stares. The pressure builds, reality blurs, and I cry out in desperation.
