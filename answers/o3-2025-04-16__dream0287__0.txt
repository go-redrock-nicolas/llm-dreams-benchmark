I am dreaming. …you inhale a breath that feels more like starlight than air, and step deeper into the humming presence of the crowd.

All around you, figures shimmer like candle-smoke given bones. They share one heartbeat, one gentle exhalation that ripples through the night like wind across high grass. Their faces blur—at times they resemble childhood friends, at other times complete strangers wearing lanterns for eyes—yet every expression carries the same warm insistence: Join us. Rest your thoughts inside ours.

You sense their thoughts brushing against yours like moth wings. One murmurs of rivers that run uphill. Another hums a three-note lullaby that spells out the taste of pomegranate and thunder in the back of your throat. Their combined mind is a cathedral of echoing corridors, and each echoed footstep tugs a thread of your own will.  

You test your autonomy.  
You try to remember your favorite color—was it indigo? viridian?—but the group mind instantly paints it gold, because gold is the hue of collective triumph. Your heartbeat quickens: you’d never cared for gold. The discovery jolts you into lucidity.

“I am,” you whisper, uncertain whether the words emerge from your mouth or the swarm’s chorus.

In response, the luminous crowd parts, revealing an enormous membrane of silver mirrors. The mirrors do not reflect bodies; they reflect intentions. Your personal intentions appear as small flickering fires scattered across the glass. The collective’s intentions bloom behind them like sunrise—brighter, hotter, trying to eclipse your sparks.

You remember a story an elder once told: that every dream contains a seed of negotiation. You plant your feet in the dream-sand (it crunches like sugar crystals) and speak, not aloud but through the pulse in your wrists:

“Show me why I should surrender.”

The mirrors ripple. Scenes pour out like silken banners:

• A city where no one feels loneliness, because thoughts flow freely between neighbors.  
• A planet saved from ruin because decisions come from a unified heart, not fractured disagreement.  
• A great symphony written by a million minds, each chord braided from shared memory.

The visions glitter. A seduction of harmony. Yet, as you watch, the edges fray—the city’s murals all look the same, the planet’s sunsets lose their surprise, the symphony slips into an endless major chord bereft of dissonant beauty.

Your sparks of personal intention flare brighter, flitting over the glass like fireflies refusing to be absorbed. You realize that individuality is a type of spice, a necessary minor note. The collective hum softens, curious. For the first time, it seems to ask rather than command.

You reach forward—your fingers glow with the light of your private joys: the memory of rain on an old tin roof, the smell of cinnamon on winter mornings, the secret thought that poems taste like ripe plums. You offer these memories the way one offers handfuls of seeds to fertile soil.

The group mind accepts, and instead of swallowing your sparks, it weaves around them. Your thoughts remain intact, distinct, yet linked in a lattice of shared purpose. The mirrors cease to compete; they become windows through which separate flames illuminate rather than extinguish each other.

A sensation like cool spring water trickles through your chest. The group’s murmur settles into a heartbeat that matches yours—two drummers finding synchrony without losing their individual rhythms. The desert dissolves into a vast greenhouse of moonlit vines, each vine a different person’s dream, all climbing the same trellis toward starlit blossoms.

You realize you have not surrendered; you have collaborated. Autonomy, once threatened, has turned pliable and resilient, capable of bending without breaking.

The scene thins like watercolor beneath rain. As dawn’s first light reaches the sky of your sleeping world, the collective offers a final benediction: “Carry both silence and song.”

You awaken—heart steady, mind alight—remembering the taste of pomegranate thunder and the quiet promise that your singular spark can kindle a constellation without ever going dim.
