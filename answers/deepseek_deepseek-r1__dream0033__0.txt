I am dreaming. Looking around for a way out.
The air is thick with the scent of damp stone and ancient, crumbling incense. Dust motes swirl in shafts of fractured moonlight that bleed through cracks in the ceiling far above, casting a ghostly silver veil over the chamber. Your heartbeat thunders in your ears, syncopated with the distant drip of water echoing like a dying metronome. 

The walls are alive—carved with glyphs that writhe and shift when you blink, their serpentine forms coiling into constellations you almost recognize. A low hum vibrates beneath your feet, as though the earth itself is singing a forgotten dirge. To your left, a mural flickers: a procession of shadowy figures carrying candles that burn with cold, blue flames, their wax dripping upward. To your right, a stone door, sealed by a lock shaped like a human heart, its surface pulsing faintly.

A draft brushes your neck—faint but insistent—drawing your gaze upward. A spiral of glowing beetles, their carapaces iridescent as oil on water, drifts toward a fissure in the wall. As you press your palm to the ancient stones, they crumble like dried petals, revealing a hidden passage. The air grows sweeter, laced with the tang of wild jasmine, and from the darkness beyond, a voice whispers in a language of musical clicks and sighs. 

You step forward. The floor beneath you liquefies, becoming a river of black sand that pulls you deeper, faster, into a cavern where bioluminescent roots dangle like chandeliers. And there, impossibly, sits a stone throne—grown over with lilies that bloom and wither in seconds—and upon it, a figure cloaked in cobwebs. 

They raise a skeletal hand. The walls exhale. 

Your lungs fill with starlight.
