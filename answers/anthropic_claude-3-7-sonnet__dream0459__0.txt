I am dreaming. The air around me feels viscous, carrying scents that don't exist in waking life—something like the color blue if it had a fragrance, mingled with the memory of childhood laughter. I'm standing in a corridor lined with countless doors, each one shifting slightly, breathing almost, as if alive.

I approach the first door, ornate with carvings that rearrange themselves as I watch. When I open it, I find myself seated across from my grandmother, though she appears as I've never seen her—young, vibrant, with knowing eyes that seem to hold centuries. Her smile transforms me: I feel myself becoming more gentle, my voice softer, memories of bedtime stories and warm kitchens flooding through my veins.

"You were always the listener," she says, though her lips don't move.

I blink and find myself walking through another doorway. Now I'm in a vast library with impossible architecture—staircases curving upward into misty heights, bookshelves arranging themselves around me. A colleague I barely know in waking life sits surrounded by ancient texts, and suddenly I'm articulate, analytical, my thoughts crystallizing into perfect structures of logic. My posture straightens; I feel taller, sharper-edged.

"You're different here," they observe.

The scene dissolves into rain that falls upward. Each droplet contains a face—friends, lovers, strangers from passing trains. I realize I am not one self but a kaleidoscope, constantly rearranged by the mirrors of others' perceptions.

I wade into an ocean made of whispered conversations. With each step deeper, I cycle through versions of myself—the child with my father, fearful yet brave; the confidant with my closest friend, revealing secrets I didn't know I carried; the stranger in a foreign city, reinvented and mysterious.

The water speaks: "Which is the real you?"

I open my mouth to answer and butterflies emerge, each wing inscribed with a different name I've been called. They form the shape of a face—my face—before scattering into a night sky that's suddenly beneath my feet.

I'm falling upward into stars that form a vast mirror, reflecting not my physical form but something more essential—the thread connecting all these selves, vibrating with a harmony I can almost name.

I wake within the dream, understanding: I am the space between all these reflections, the consciousness that witnesses each transformation while remaining, somehow, continuously myself.
