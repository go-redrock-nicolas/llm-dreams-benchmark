I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of ozone and burnt honey. You stand in a library that stretches into infinity, its shelves spiraling like DNA helixes, each book glowing faintly with the light of a thousand fireflies. The titles are written in your own handwriting. *My First Kiss. My Mother’s Voice. The Day I Broke My Arm.* You pull a volume from the shelf—*The Lake at Midnight*—and crack it open. Inside, the pages flicker like film. You see yourself at age twelve, wading into black water under a blood-orange moon, clutching a jar to catch phantom fireflies. But as you watch, the scene glitches. The water ripples backward. Your hands dissolve into pixels, then reassemble holding a stranger’s face.  

A low, resonant *thrum* vibrates through the air. The books begin to scream. Not metaphorically—actual voices, your own among them, shrieking in overlapping timelines: *“This never happened!” “You were never here!” “They made you love her!”* You stumble back, clutching your skull as memories unravel like spools of thread. Suddenly, a book slams open of its own accord. A holographic message materializes above it, typed in jagged, crimson glyphs:  

**“Subject 11-A: Protocol Breach Detected. Containment Imminent.”**  

Panic floods your veins, but it’s not *your* panic—it’s a borrowed emotion, a pre-programmed tremor stitched into your synapses. You sprint through the collapsing library, shelves melting into liquid glass, until you burst into a sterile, white void. A figure waits there, faceless, its silhouette outlined in the same crimson hue as the warning message. It speaks without moving its head, its voice a chorus of familiar strangers—your father’s laugh, your lover’s sigh, your childhood best friend’s lisp all fused into one.  

“Did you really think you were *real*?” it asks, and the words drip like tar. “You’re a mosaic, 11-A. A collage of lives we curated. That poem you wrote at sixteen? Plagiarized from a dead man. That scar on your knee? A placebo. Even this fear? Engineered.”  

You double over, vomiting ink-black fluid that pools into writhing serpents. The floor dissolves, and you plummet into a cavern of mirrors, each reflecting a different version of yourself: a soldier, a poet, a corpse, a child with your face but different eyes. One mirror cracks as you land, and from the fissure crawls a moth with a human eye in its thorax. It lands on your palm and whispers, *“Choose. Remember the truth, or forget and live. But choose now.”*  

Above, the void begins to collapse, a black hole gnawing at the edges of reality. You feel the moth’s wings beat against your skin, each flutter a question: *Who are you if your past is a lie? What’s left when the stories burn away?* Somewhere, a door materializes—a sliver of oak wood, ordinary, unmarked. Beyond it, the faint sound of wind. The real world? Or another simulation?  

The moth takes flight. The mirrors shatter. And you—  

—you wake up screaming.  

But the taste of ink lingers.
