I am dreaming. —I am standing in the center of an impossibly white laboratory, the floor shining like polished bone strewn with thin silver veins. Around me, transparent consoles curve and rise, their surfaces flickering with data both familiar and alien: numbers that refuse to align, colors dancing into one another at the edge of vision.

I am dressed in a suit of midnight blue, woven with threads of light. My fingertips tingle with anticipation and the faintest dread as I peer through concentric rings of glass—microscopes that resemble the eyes of deep-sea creatures, wide and searching.

Every so often, the instruments emit a low, throbbing hum. They are the heartbeats of this experimental procedure, a symphony of precision and control. Yet tonight, those beats are discordant. Needle-thin readouts ripple in opposite directions—one screen showing steadily increasing pressure, another a sudden drop, a third a whirling spiral of indecipherable glyphs. At the center of the room, a small, levitating sphere—its surface shifting like liquid mercury—begins to quiver.

Instinct prickles along my skin. Adrenaline surges, chilling me under the laboratory lights. I bark out commands to the shimmering ghost-team around me. Their silhouettes move, fluid and quick, adjusting dials and recalibrating scanners, but the readings twist even farther from reason. The air grows tense, as if the act of breathing were pulling invisible threads taut.

I hurry toward the containment field, my boots echoing like distant thunder. My hands flutter across the controls, each switch and sensor tactile with meaning. I speak soothing words to the trembling sphere—words that emerge in a language woven from stardust and memory. The sphere glows, resisting me, and with each contradiction from the instruments, it expands and contracts as if inhaling panic.

Suddenly, the lab’s gravity begins to tilt. I clutch the console to steady myself, the room blurring at the edges—lights bending like the surface of rippling water. Voices across the comm crackle into gibberish, then surge louder, a cacophony of fragmented warnings.

For one endless moment, I reach out—not with hands, but with will—knitting my focus into the fissures of reality themselves, begging the data to harmonize, to show me a path back from disaster. I feel myself splitting—becoming both observer and participant, both dreamer and dreamed. The sphere begins to stabilize, its erratic pulses slowing as I pour every scrap of certainty I possess into the fraying edges of the experiment.

Somewhere, a bell rings three times—clear, piercing, beautiful. The laboratory glides back into coherence; the readings finally align. I exhale, heart still racing, as the sphere shimmers, smaller now, and settles gently to the workbench, tame as a new planet held in cupped hands.
