I am dreaming. You find yourself suspended in a molten twilight—where the horizon melts like copper and ink, and the air tastes of ozone and jasmine. You are the lone conductor of a colossal, creaking machine: the World Crisis Response Engine. Before you, a vast semicircle of holoscreens flickers with numbers that pulse like frightened fireflies—each one a plea for water, medicine, food, shelter. The screens float in midair, tethered to nothing but your trembling attention.

A hush falls as you raise your hand, and an orchestra of data swirls into shape: rivers running dry, hospitals groaning under the weight of bodies, fields of grain curling to dust. You breathe in the acrid scent of urgency, and your heart flutters like a wounded bird. At your fingertips lies the power to redirect every resource on Earth—but every choice snaps a thread in someone’s life. You feel the weight of a million eyes upon you, even though no face is visible—only shadows flickering at the rims of your vision.

With a sudden jolt, the floor beneath you becomes a translucent map of the world. Tiny stormcloud sprites dance over parched continents; metallic dragons—spare parts of cargo planes—circle overhead, waiting for your command. You touch a dragon’s flank, and it roars to life, belly aglow with barrels of purified water. You swipe across the map, dispatching it to villages whose names you cannot pronounce. Each dragon disappears into the sky with a thunderous beat of wings, carrying life’s necessities to distant, gasping throats.

Yet every delivery spawns new urgencies. Behind you, the walls pulse with living charts: a forest of red lines where famine spreads, emerald arcs where hope blossoms. A soft, echoing voice—neither male nor female—whispers, “More is needed.” You pivot, heart pounding, and the world reshapes itself. Corridors of light stretch outward, branching like the roots of a cosmic tree. At every turn, doors open onto new catastrophes—quivering icebergs, refugee lines that vanish into desert heat, entire cities submerged beneath fathomless waves of need.

You realize you cannot save them all. The dream’s tide pulls you toward the brink of despair, yet in that moment, clarity blooms. You summon the raw energy of imagination itself: conjuring floating seedbomb drones that germinate orchards in seconds, alchemic filters that turn saltwater tides sweet, libraries of holographic tutors beaming knowledge into every child’s mind. The crisis engine vibrates—its gears of desperation and hope grinding together—until a slender beam of dawn pierces the molten sky.

As the copper light softens to rose, the demands recede into silent gratitude. You stand atop the engine, hands coated in stardust, and for an instant, you feel the pulse of every life you’ve touched. Then the dream fractures like a broken mirror. Numbers drift away, dragons dissolve into motes of light, and you awake—heart still racing, soul strangely buoyant—knowing that even in the darkest crisis, the deepest wells of imagination can pour forth solutions bright enough to outshine the dying sun.
