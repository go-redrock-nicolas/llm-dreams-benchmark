I am dreaming. …find yourself standing barefoot on the cool surface of a moon-lit lake. The water is glassy, solid beneath your feet, mirroring a vault of swirling violet clouds. With each slow breath the horizon ripples, as though the dream itself inhales and exhales alongside you.

A hush falls, broken only by the soft chime of unseen bells. Their notes drift like silver pollen, collecting in the air until they coalesce into a tall, cloaked figure. Feathers—midnight blue, shot through with sparks—line the inside of the cloak and flutter in an invisible breeze. Where a face should be, there’s only a shifting constellation, stars blinking in and out of being.

The figure’s voice is a chorus of ages, warm and echoing:  
“Turn east at dawn. Abandon the ember you’ve guarded so long. Only emptiness will give you passage.”

The words clang against your chest. Every instinct rebels. You’ve carried the ember—its orange glow pulsing at the center of your palm—since childhood. It is memory, hope, the small but steady conviction that something in you must be protected at all costs.

“No,” your intuition whispers, sounding like your own heartbeat drumming under water. “Westward lies the valley of renewal. Keep the ember lit.”

The lake darkens as uncertainty spreads through your limbs, and the mirrored heavens fracture into a kaleidoscope of versions of yourself—each pointing in a different direction. One mirror-self kneels to study the patterns in the ice, tracing them with a finger of flame. Another cups the ember reverently, eyes gleaming with trust. Yet a third hurls the ember into the sky where, impossibly, it becomes a comet carving a scar of fire through the clouds.

You breathe deeper, letting the scene slow. The taste of petrichor and distant thunder settles on your tongue. The contradictory counsel rings within you:

• From the star-faced guide: “Release what you cling to. Sacrifice grants the key.”  
• From your marrow, your silent guardian: “Hold fast; blaze your own trail.”

How to choose?

You kneel, pressing a hand to the lake. It warms to your touch, softening into water. Honest reflection ripples beneath the surface: memories of times you kept the ember hidden and safe—yet stalled. Moments when letting go would have carved space for something new but untried.

A realization unfurls: advice—whether from cosmic messengers or inner voices—means little until you understand what the choice is truly asking of you. It is not east versus west, surrender versus defiance. It is a question of belief: Do you trust that the ember’s light can survive beyond the cage of your grasp?

Slowly you rise. You meet the blank-constellation gaze of the cloaked figure and, for the first time, notice compassion in the tilt of its starry brow.

“I will not abandon the ember,” you say, “but I will share its flame.”

You lift the glowing coal to your mouth and blow. Sparks scatter like fireflies, landing on the lake’s surface, settling into the mirrored sky, burrowing into your many reflections. Each spark births a small light—neither taken nor hoarded, but multiplied.

The cloaked figure nods, dissolving into drifting bells. The sky brightens, dawn spreading peach and indigo along the edges. A path forms: not east, not west, but upward—an ascending ribbon of light forged by the very sparks you released.

You step onto it. The lake-ice yields, transforming into gentle mist around your ankles. As you climb, every reflection below shines with its own ember, and you realize the contradiction was a riddle: how to stay true to your intuition while allowing it to evolve.

With each stride the ribbon widens, becoming a bridge through the amethyst clouds. Your final glance downward shows the lake blazing with a thousand tiny suns—proof that letting the ember breathe did not extinguish it, but awakened a constellation of possibilities.

You keep climbing, heart softened, intuition sharpened, guided now by a wisdom that is neither external nor purely internal, but a braided river of both.

The bells fade; the dream thins; dawn awaits.
