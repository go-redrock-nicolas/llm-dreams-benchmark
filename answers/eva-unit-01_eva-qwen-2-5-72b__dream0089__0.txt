I am dreaming. As I look around and feel the cool, refreshing night air on my skin, my senses are awakened by the soft, glowing light of flames dancing in the distance. Surprisingly, the trees surrounding me are not being consumed by the fire. They thrive in the comforting embrace of the warm light.

The lush green of the trees is not a symbol of their life, but rather, it indicates decay and death. The vibrant colors of autumn--reds, oranges, and golds--garnish the healthy and robust trees. It's as if they're celebrating their strength through spectacular displays of color, a vibrant rebellion against the depressing greyness that typically represents expiration.

The river near my feet runs thick and syrupy, defying the very concept of fluidity. Its rich, dense texture is more than my mind can process. Despite its oddity, it feels comforting, embracing my feet as I step into its unique embrace.

The sun rises in the west, setting in the east. It's a massive, cold orb, illuminating the world with a calm, blue light. The warmth of the sun is replaced by the stars, twinkling warmly from above. As I breathe deeply, I realize that the air is most invigorating at night, while the daylight brings a sense of fatigue.

In this dream world, life flourishes in darkness, and death is painted in bright, verdant hues. Everything that once seemed familiar to me has been turned on its head, creating a strange yet captivating realm where the boundaries of existence are twisted, but not broken.

I am dreaming.
