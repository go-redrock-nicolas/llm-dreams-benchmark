I am dreaming. You focus on the taut coil of tension inside you—each shallow breath a tightening of an inner spring. In this dream, every inhalation paints broad strokes across the sky; every exhale ripples through your limbs like liquid silk. You sense the challenge looming ahead as a colossal gate of obsidian vines, thorns glinting like steel against a copper sunset. Your heart pulses against your ribcage; muscles quake with anticipation.

Working with these physical manifestations of stress, you lean into the tension. You let the shallow breaths become deliberate drums, thumping out a rhythm that carries through the air. With each beat, the vines around the gate quiver in time. You close your eyes, centering on that rhythmic drum inside you. Then—slowly, intentionally—your chest expands, allowing a long, soft breath to flood your lungs. You imagine the air as liquid luminescence: golden, warming, fluid. As it spreads through you, the obsidian vines soften, glowing faintly at their edges.

When you exhale, you visualize the stress flowing outward, coalescing into a shimmering sphere of pale blue light that hovers before the gate. It pulses in time with your heartbeat—strong, steady, unafraid. The sphere grows until the vines retract, unveiling a narrow passage carved into black stone. A low hum reverberates from within, beckoning you forward.

Stepping through the arch, you find yourself on a winding path of polished onyx tiles, each footstep sending out tiny ripples of sound. The air is thick with the scent of night-blooming flowers—jasmine and moon-lily—whose ghostly petals drift like lanterns overhead. Ahead, the corridor splits into three tunnels, each bathed in a different hue: emerald green, sapphire blue, and molten gold.

Your muscles, once rigid with stress, now feel supple, alive. You realize that the breath-and-tension ritual you’ve practiced here is your compass: the more you stay connected to that inner rhythm, the clearer your path becomes. You choose the tunnel that glows like sunrise—molten gold—and with each step, your tension unwinds like a spool of thread, feeding the light around you until the world is nothing but warm illumination, and the challenge ahead feels not like an obstacle but an invitation.
