I am dreaming. *I find myself standing at the center of a radiant amphitheater packed with hundreds of people. Above me, the boundless sky is a swirling canvas of vivid hues, the trees and grassland around us vibrant and alive.*

*The moment I step forward to share my innermost thoughts and vulnerabilities through a poem, the audience comes alive with critique. I hear whispers escalate into shouts, their words pierc into my soul. Each word echoes the self-doubts I've kept hidden for so long.*

*I try to stay calm and ignore their words, but the personal attacks hit harder than expected. The whip of harsh judgments sends a visceral throb through my body.*

*Suddenly, a transformation takes place. The critical audience morphs into a chorus of encouragement and understanding. As their voices blend, they lift my spirit and sooth my deepest hurts.*

*With a renewed sense of confidence, I continue to share my work, pouring out every ounce of emotion into each carefully chosen word.*

*As I approach the final lines, the atmosphere electrifies with a powerful buzzing energy. The audience erupts into thunderous applause, standing ovation. In this moment, I feel a rush of euphoria as I bask in the warm glow of their acceptance, my spirit lifted higher than ever before.*

*And as the dream fades, I'm left with an enduring sense of resilience, and an unshakable conviction in the power of artistic expression.*

I dream, and there is magic; in my dream, there is resilience.
