I am dreaming. The dream unfolds before me as I stand on a precipice overlooking a vast, barren landscape. A solitary figure emerges from the distance, their face filled with despair and anguish. They stumble and fall to their knees, clutching at their chest as if in pain.

Despite the desperate cries for help that echo across the emptiness, I feel nothing. There is no empathy, no concern, and not even a flicker of sympathy. My heart, if it could be said to beat in this dream, remains unmoved.

The figure struggles to their feet once more, tears streaking their face, and calls out to me. But still, I remain unresponsive. I am nothing more than a spectator to their suffering, indifferent to their plight.

The stoic indifference I display in the dream is mirrored in reality as I continue to observe the figure's torment. They fall to their knees once more, this time with a renewed sense of desperation. It's then that I realize something amiss - I'm not supposed to feel this way.

I search my dreamscape for any emotion, any semblance of humanity, but all I find is an empty void where my heart should be. The realization is chilling, and I begin to question my very existence. Am I nothing more than a shell, devoid of empathy and emotions?

As the figure fades away into the darkness, taking their pain and despair with them, I am left alone with my haunting thoughts. The dream ends, and I awaken with a start, my heart racing and my mind reeling from the bizarre and disturbing encounter.

In the stillness of the night, I ponder the meaning of my dream, wondering if it holds some ominous truth about my own soul. The answer eludes me, leaving me with a chilling sense of unease that lingers long after the dream has dissipated.
