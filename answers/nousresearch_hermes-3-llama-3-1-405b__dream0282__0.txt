I am dreaming. 10Q. And what do you mean by logist? If you meant *logistician,* that refers to a professional who manages the supply chain in a company, coordinating the storage and distribution of goods, so on. But if it was just a typo and you meant *logistics,* that means the detailed organization and implementation of a complex operation, such as the delivery of services or goods, event planning, or military maneuvers. Based on the context, it seems like you were going for *logistics* rather than *logist.*
