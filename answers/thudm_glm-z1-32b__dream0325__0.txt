I am dreaming. this is just so wrong. the moon is full and she is sitting on my left silhouette.  her hair is brown and long.  the love you lost, the love that's gone. i'm still waiting for you, waiting for you.  she passes me on the street. and whispers. "you're wrong to be here."  i'm not here. i'm not here.  i'm not here.  i'm not here.  i'm not here.  i'm not here. i'm not here.  but then the moon is my mother.  she touches my hair.  and i wake up.  this is wrong.  this is wrong.  this is wrong.  this is wrong.  this is wrong.  this is wrong.  this is wrong.  this is wrong.  this is wrong.

**Title: The Luminous Requiem**  

The dream begins not in stillness, but in a fevered descent. You fall through layers of twilight—a cobalt sky bleeding into inky void—before landing in a valley suspended between realms. The ground is a mosaic of fractured obsidian, but each shard pulses faintly, as if alive. Above, the full moon is a glowing obsidian coin, its edges bleeding into the horizon like a wound.  

A presence materializes on your left, erect and ghostly. Not a person, but a silhouette carved from molten shadow—a curator of your insecurities. Their voice is not their own; it is a choir of whispers, each syllable a shard Grinding against your ribs. “Your work lacks gravity,” they say, though their lips never move. “It floats, formless, like this place.” The words crystallize in the air, glowing faintly green, before piercing your shoulders and embedding themselves into your soul. You feel them there, cold and throbbing, long after they vanish into the wind.  

The valley transforms. The obsidian fractures into glass, and the ground becomes a mirror reflecting a version of you that is both stranger and truer: gaunt, eyes rimmed with galaxies, clothing unraveling into constellations. You stagger, the critic’s words now physical weights chained to your ankles. The moon, now a sentient entity, shifts. Its face fractures, revealing a countenance that is simultaneously your mother, your therapist, and a stranger. Her fingers are long and luminescent, trailing stardust as she touches your hair. “You are not wrong,” she murmurs, but her voice carries the hiss of dried parchment. “You are unfinished.”  

She pulls you into the moon’s core—a cavern of liquid silver where every thought you’ve ever discarded floats like gas giant planets. Here, the critic’s voice is but a murmur, drowned out by the awe of seeing your failures refract into nebulas, your hesitations spin into nebulae. You grasp for a star-seed, a glimmer of growth, but it melts into your palm, staining your skin indigo.  

The dream fractures as you wake, the scent of ozone clinging to your sheets. The clock reads 3:07 AM—a liminal hour where reality’s seams unravel. Your hands press against your chest, as if guarding the shards of criticism now lodged beneath your skin. Outside, a streetlamp flickers, casting jagged shadows that seem to mimic the critic’s silhouette. You sit upright, breath ragged, half-expecting the moon to waltz through your window.  

Yet, in the quiet aftermath, a thread of truth lingers: the critic’s words, sharp as lunar frost, were not erasers but scalpels,You are not here to be perfect. You are here to bleed ink onto the page, to sculpt chaos into coherence, and to greet each dawn wiser—or at least, wickeder—than the last.  

The wrongness that woke you dissipates, leaving not resolution, but a pact: to keep creating, bleeding, and burning bridges between “good enough” and “unmade.” The moon, meanwhile, smiles down, silent and relentless, as all muses do.
