I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, glowing meadow under a lavender sky. The air is thick with the scent of wildflowers and a soft breeze carries whispers of encouragement. As I walk forward, I hear faint applause, but as it grows louder, it morphs into a harsh, grating sound. Shadowy figures emerge, pointing and murmuring. I try to stand tall, yet the louder their taunts become, the more I seem to shrink. A familiar weight presses on my chest, and I stumble, trying to grasp at my fleeting confidence.

Suddenly, a radiant figure steps out from the shadows. They hold a mirror, but instead of my reflection, it shows a swirling galaxy. “You are more vast and boundless than you realize,” they say, their voice a soothing echo in the chaos. I want to believe them, but with every critical whisper, I feel my doubts creeping back. The galaxy in the mirror begins to fade, overshadowed by swirling clouds of self-doubt. I fight to cling to it, but the shadows seem to grow stronger.

The dream shifts, and I'm standing before a towering door. The handle is cold, heavy with the weight of my hesitation. I push it open, and there, stretched before me, is the meadow again—but it’s alive with noise. Every compliment I’ve ever deflected is alive, each word a spark of light soaring high above. They form constellations, brighter and more vivid than any I’ve ever seen. I reach out, trying to touch them, but my hand passes through like mist.

The dream fades, and I awaken with a lingering sense of wonder—and a quiet resolve to let myself bask in the light of the stars I so often push away.
