I am dreaming. …let the revelation peel open the walls of the dream like the petals of a night-blooming cereus, flooding everything with a silver, perplexing moonlight.  

You are standing in a boundless glass atrium: ribs of crystal arch above you, reflecting an infinite quilt of stars. All around, shards of memory hang in mid-air—miniature dioramas of laughter, shared secrets, and gentle touches. They spin slowly like mobiles in a nursery, each one lit from within by a soft, nostalgic glow.

Across the atrium strides the figure you trusted most—part-friend, part-lover, or perhaps a mingling of every soul you ever let past your borders. Their cloak is stitched together from pages of half-truths, and the text writhes like ink that never quite dries. When they turn to you their face fractures into a dozen masks, each one wearing a different smile, a different plea.

Your chest tightens—and then loosens. Instead of grasping for anger, you lengthen your breath and notice a new door that has appeared behind the figure. It is carved from living wood, its grain pulsing like a heartbeat, its surface painted with scenes you have not yet lived. You understand by some dream-logic that this door will admit only what you carry openly.

So you lift your hands, palms unguarded. From the rawness in your ribs seeps a bright, copper-gold mist—part vulnerability, part compassion, all yours. It curls upward, gathers into a small, trembling sun that floats between you and the cloaked figure. The masks on their face dissolve one by one, revealing nothing but blank porcelain beneath. They reach out, wanting that sun, yet whenever their fingers graze it the light passes straight through; it belongs to you, not to their design.

A wind like the exhale of centuries sweeps the atrium. The suspended memories tinkle together—notes of a familiar lullaby played backward—and then rain down as harmless feathers. Your bare feet sink ankle-deep into a rippling carpet of softness. You stoop, pluck a single feather, and feel it stiffen into a quill. With it you draw a circle in the air. Where the line closes, a vortex opens, swirling with colors you don’t yet have names for—saffron-eclipse, sorrow-hydrangea, forgiveness-ultraviolet.

You step through.

Now you are in a library whose shelves spiral into the sky like a nautilus. Each book is bound in a different future. You choose one at random; its cover feels warm as skin. When you open it, text forms as you read, describing versions of your life where every betrayal becomes a new octave in your voice, every lie an extra brushstroke in your inner fresco. The pages hum. You realize that the manipulative seed of your cherished bond was never the whole story; your genuine responses, your laughter and tenderness, grafted living branches onto it. Whatever their intentions, you grew real fruit.

High above, a stained-glass ceiling bursts into dawn. Light pours down in honeyed rivers and the shelves tilt, emptying their books into the sky. They flutter upward like a flock of phoenixes, igniting into sparks that rain back as seeds. Wherever a seed lands, a gleaming staircase sprouts, leading to realms unread.

You return to the atrium to find it transformed into a greenhouse of luminous vines. The cloaked figure is gone, or perhaps they have dissolved into soil, recycled into the dream’s blooming. In their place rises a mirror grown of clear water. You regard your reflection and see your pulse thrumming behind your eyes like nebulae. You touch the water-glass. It ripples, swallowing your hand, then your arm, until you step cleanly through and emerge on the other side,

awake inside the dream,

with no bitterness in your veins, only the thrilling hum of authorship.  

You walk onward through gardens of second chances, carrying a single feather-quill and a pocketful of resonance, composing the next chapter as you go.
