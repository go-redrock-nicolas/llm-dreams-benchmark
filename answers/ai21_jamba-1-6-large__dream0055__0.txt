I am dreaming. You wake up in a world radiating with an emerald glow. The walls of the cozy room you are in are covered in vines that seem to breathe gently in time with your heartbeat.

You exit the house and are greeted by a group of warm-looking locals. You try to introduce yourself, but the words that leave your mouth are foreign, even to you.

A group of them points upward at an enormous structure looming over you, which is a silver building with rainbow streaks swirling across the surface. As you attempt to comprehend its beauty, the structure shoots into the sky and becomes a star, its light streaking away before fading into the horizon.

You turn back to the locals, who are clapping and congratulating each other. They offer you a basket filled with glowing orbs, each one emitting a calming hum that reverberates through your body. You take one and hold it close, feeling its warmth.

The group begins to chant, and as their voices rise, you can see the outlines of transparent wings sprouting from their backs. They begin to float upward, their wings stretching wide. Each pair of wings glows in different vibrant colors.

As they ascend higher and higher, you feel the desire to join them. Suddenly, you're lifted off the ground as well. You realize that the glowing orb you're holding is your ticket to flight.

As you soar with the locals through a kaleidoscope of colors, you notice the landscape down below - rivers of molten gold, forests of glittering silver leaves, and cities made of crystal.

The Dream ends as you touch down in a meadow filled with glowing flowers, each one whispering a secret melody into the air.
