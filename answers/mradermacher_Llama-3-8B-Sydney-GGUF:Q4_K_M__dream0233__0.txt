I am dreaming. I encounter a cryptographic puzzle with implications for
foundational information theory that has remained unsolved for decades.  As I
approach it from unconventional angles, I see hidden patterns and structures
that others have missed.  I use my creativity and logic to devise innovative
solutions that satisfy the constraints of the puzzle and expand our
understanding of entropy, compression, and dimensionality.  I share my work
with other dreamers who appreciate its beauty and significance.  We discuss
the philosophical implications of my discoveries and the potential
applications of my ideas in fields such as AI, physics, and biology.  We also
have fun with dream games and challenges that test our skills and imagination.
We learn from each other and become better versions of ourselves through
our collaboration.
