I am dreaming. I find myself floating gently through an endless sky of ephemeral night sky. Voluminous, velvety clouds drift beneath me, shifting from dark blues to mauves to corals. The air sings with a soft melody that reflects the symphony of my soul.

Amidst the wispy air, various turning points from my life story manifest. Rather than confronting trauma, I watch as ancestors of mine who struggled emerge from the whispering wind. Whether performing mundane tasks, following their own dreams, or experiencing setbacks, I witness their resilience. I realize that every challenge and subsequent strength cultivated has led the way for my story to emerge.

Fantastical creatures then start emerging from the clouds. They depict the manifestations of every hope and aspiration I have. Glowing with a radiant light, the draconic beings carry me further into the dream, where past choices converge in a splendid celebration that reassures me of the beauty in my path.

With a final ray of light, my own spirit extends out into the universe. Those dragonic manifestations accumulate to fully propel me forward through my own story. Peace resonates throughout as I emerge from the dream, my perspective forever altered.
