I am dreaming. Dreamworld unfolds, hyperreal and intimate.

I stand in a vast, empty theater. Every seat is filled with faceless silhouettes stretching into infinity. A spotlight blazes down, trapping me in its merciless glare. I clutch a portfolio of my innermost thoughts and fears, painstakingly distilled onto pages dripping with midnight ink.

A thunderous voice booms from everywhere and nowhere: "Let the critique begin!" The audience erupts into a deafening chorus of whispers, each one piercing deeper than the last.

"A fraud! You're nothing but shallow pretense!"

"Look at how clumsy the prose is, like a child playing at being profound!"

"The themes are so derivative, where's the originality?"

Each word is an ice pick to my soul, freezing the very essence of my being. The critique continues, growing more vicious by the moment. But then something shifts. The dream metamorphoses, and I find myself in a lush garden, where my deepest insecurities manifest as thorny vines and wildflowers. I tend to them with gentle care, coaxing them to bloom into something beautiful.
