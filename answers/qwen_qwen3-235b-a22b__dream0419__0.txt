I am dreaming.

In this realm, time has melted into a viscous syrup, dripping from the barbed tips of obsidian trees that spiral into a violet sky. A forest surrounds me, but not one born of earth — this forest grows from thought, from unspoken emotion, from the brittle husks of forgotten dreams. The roots don't dig down, they unfurl sideways, brushing against fragments of memory like blind fingers trying to find purchase in the dark.

I feel it before I see it — the discomfort. A throbbing pressure behind my ribs, as though someone has poured warm wax into my chest and it’s cooling now into the shape of a question. Then I hear them, the ones who praise me.

Their voices are silken and sweet, but they come from every direction, echoing off the liquid glass of the trunks around me.

_"You did better than the others."_  
_"You always understand so quickly."_  
_"So much more evolved than before..."_

Each word lands on my skin like a feather dipped in lead.

I am standing in a clearing now, and they surround me — faceless figures draped in gold cloaks, their mouths moving in slow-motion, smiling without teeth. They lift golden chalices and toast me. I raise a hand instinctively to wave, but my fingers tremble. I should be elated. I deserved this. I see it clearly — the late nights I spent unraveling myself, the pain I translated into understanding, the parts of me I quieted just to be heard.

But here, bathed in their gaze, I feel like a fossil. A beautiful, hollowed-out thing, set on display under invisible lights.

And that is when the forest begins to shift.

The trees start to bend inward, as if eavesdropping. Limbs reconfigure into arches, and against the twilight sky emerges a door — not made of wood or stone, but of glass made from reflection, shimmering with every version I have ever shown to the world.

One word floats in front of it: *Acknowledge*.

The moment I speak it, the door shatters — but not loudly. Sound has dissolved here. Splinters of glass land softly, chilling the air like breath against frost. Behind the door is not a place, but a presence — vast and breathing. Something older than judgment, older than need.

A voice, if it can be called that, rises from within:  
_"You fear the praise because you fear the self it praising."_

I step forward. Inside the door, there is a version of me sitting cross-legged on a mirror-sea. Her eyes are closed. Her face is wet, not from tears, but from time — liquid memory flowing over her like forgotten hours. I realize I recognize her — the one I tucked away every time I heard applause, the one who flinched when someone called me "special."

She opens her eyes. They burn with quiet green fire.

_"You don’t trust what you cannot doubt,"_ she says.  
_"But belonging is not won. It is remembered. And the part of you that remembers has been silent too long."_

Behind her, the sea of mirrors ripples — revealing hundreds of versions of me: the child who laughed without restraint, the teenager who screamed secrets into pillowcased confessions, the grown-up who offered wisdom like tribute, afraid to appear too full. Each reflection whispers a primary truth:

_"You were whole long before their praise. You will remain whole long after."_

And in that moment, I understand.

The forest softens. The gold-cloaked figures evaporate, replaced by a sky strewn with stars that pulse in rhythm with a heartbeat not my own, but deeply known.

Praise no longer feels like theft — it feels like rain. Sometimes nourishing, sometimes drenching, but never more than I can weather. My body relaxes — no longer bracing for impact, for exposure, for the price of being seen.

I rise within myself. Fully there.

And the dream does not end.

It sinks into the marrow of who I am and whispers, softly: *This — is your truth dreaming itself awake.*
