I am dreaming. I awaken in a reality where the only colors are countless shades of blue. Items, plants, and even people are composed entirely of different blue hues. The sky, a deep midnight blue, transitions smoothly into a cerulean horizon where colossal spirals of aquamarine energy twist upwards, vanishing into the azure nothingness above. The ground beneath my feet is a soft, powdery lapis lazuli. 

As I take my first step, a wave of indigo strokes flow from beneath my foot, spreading outwards in intricate, transient patterns. The energy spirals begin to hum a harmonic, otherworldly tune, their frequencies visually resonating through the blue spectrum. 

I find myself holding a smooth, sapphire orb that emits a faint, pulsating glow. With every beat, the blue around me shimmers faintly, as though responding to some unseen force. A feeling of serenity washes over me, and for a moment, I feel at one with this monochrome world. 

From the corner of my eye, I spot a figure moving towards me. As they approach, I realize they are a silhouette, their edges painted in ultramarine while their center remains an inky void. They extend a hand, and within it, a holographic projection of a clock appears—time flowing both forward and backward simultaneously. The figure gestures towards the spirals, and as they do, the ultramarine spirals begin to shift and spin in the opposite direction. 

Suddenly, the energy spirals collapse, turning the sky into an intense, stormy blue. The ground beneath me begins to crack, releasing tendrils of cobalt mist that rise and coil around my body. My breath quickens as I realize I am no longer in control of this dream. 

I feel a tug on my mind, pulling me upward, and I ascend rapidly into the swirling blue vortex. As I look down, the ground below fractures completely, revealing an endless abyss of ultramarine nothingness. I close my eyes, bracing for the inevitable fall, but instead, I am consumed by the blue. 

And then, I awake. But this time, the world outside my window is not the same. There’s an unmistakable blue tint to everything, a faint echo of the dream that lingers, urging me to question what is real.
