I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Golden Storm**  

I am dreaming.  

The world around me is draped in twilight, drowned in the heavy hues of indigo and bruised purple. The streets curve and twist like veins through a body too weary to pulse, lined with cobblestones that whisper under my feet—old secrets, old sorrows. This place has a name, but it is one I cannot remember, only that it belongs to a people who have let their history harden into walls—walls around their homes, around their hearts.  

I walk through the town square, where statues of forgotten generals glare down with hollow eyes, their mouths twisted in silent commands. The air smells of charcoal and damp earth. A crowd gathers, but it does not part for me—it seethes, restless, suspicious. They know why I am here.  

I lift my voice, but the sound is stolen by the wind before it can take form. Still, I speak. The words are strange, new—seeds tossed onto rocky soil. Somewhere beyond the edges of the crowd, a fire blooms, golden and hungry. It licks the sky, casting long shadows that twist like living things. People turn toward it, murmuring, fear and wonder entwined in their throats.  

A woman steps forward, her face half-hidden by a shawl. "You speak of change," she says, "but we have heard these words before. They vanish like smoke."  

I reach into my coat, but instead of pamphlets, my fingers close around something warm, pulsing—a heart? No. A handful of embers, glowing faintly. They do not burn me. "You are right," I say. "Words do vanish—unless they are carried. Unless they are stoked like fire." I open my palm, and the embers rise, spinning in the air like tiny stars.  

The crowd inhales—a single, shuddering breath.  

Someone reaches for an ember. A child. As it lands in their cupped hands, a spark flares—not of destruction, but illumination. For a moment, their face is golden, unburdened.  

Then the dream unravels like thread pulled taut. The square dissolves, the voices blur into echoes. But the fire remains, burning somewhere beyond sight. And I know the work is not yet done.  

I wake with the taste of smoke on my tongue.
