I am dreaming. I open my eyes within the dream, finding myself adrift in a vast and shifting realm. The ground beneath my bare feet is a tapestry of swirling colors—deep violets, molten golds, silken blues—everchanging, as if the world itself is breathing in slow tides. Overhead, the sky ripples with clouds that look like memories—half-shaped, untouchable—gliding past a silvery moon that hovers low and luminous.

Somewhere to my left, I sense a presence, neither threatening nor welcoming, just *there*. I recognize it with a start: the feeling I’ve so carefully locked away, the emotion I’ve tiptoed around in waking life. It’s a shadow within the glow, shapeless but palpable, pulsing with a cold ache. My chest tightens, instinct urging me to run—but this is a dream, and so I stay.

With trembling breath, I kneel and stretch out my hands, inviting the emotion closer. It hesitates, swirling just beyond reach—a storm at the edge of vision. But I will myself to open further, softening the walls around my heart, lighting the dark with curiosity rather than dread. This unnamed feeling, which at first appeared monstrous, begins to take shape: a bruised violet mist edged with soft indigo, tender as a wound. It seeps around me, within me, resolving into the heaviness of sadness unmet and a longing too long denied.

I let myself feel its weight: the sorrow, the longing, the ache for something once lost. The feeling is frightening in its intensity, yet as I allow myself to experience it fully—without judgment or escape—I find a strange warmth glowing at my center. Tears slip down my cheeks, gilded in the moonlight, falling to earth and sprouting silvery flowers where they land. Each petal gleams with the beauty of acceptance.

In the quiet after the storm, colors sharpen and air turns sweet. The feeling no longer threatens but enfolds me, its edges softened by understanding. As moonflowers open all around, I wake slowly, carrying with me the memory of that deep, risky embrace—the truth that even the most shadowed feelings, when given space to breathe, become part of the garden of the soul.
