I am dreaming. You’re dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and old paperbacks, as if the world itself is exhaling a memory. You stand in a hallway that stretches infinitely, its walls made of translucent glass etched with faint, flickering scenes—your first day of school, a birthday party where no one sang, a closet door left ajar at night. Each pane hums with a low, resonant tone, vibrating in your molars. You press a hand to one of the walls, and the glass ripples like water.  

Suddenly, you’re inside the memory.  

You’re six again, sitting cross-legged on a shaggy rug in your childhood home. The ceiling looms impossibly high, its shadows alive with the creaks of a house that never sleeps. Your mother’s voice floats down the hallway, sharp and distant, arguing with someone you can’t see. The words blur into a static hiss, but the tone is unmistakable—a jagged melody of disappointment. You clutch a stuffed bear with one button eye, its fur matted from years of anxious fingers. When the shouting stops, silence floods the room like a tide, heavy and suffocating. You learn, in that moment, to equate quiet with safety, to shrink your voice until it’s a whisper even you can barely hear.  

The dream shifts.  

Now you’re older, fifteen, standing in a schoolyard under a bruised-purple sky. A group of friends laughs nearby, their voices bright and careless. You hover at the edge, a half-smile frozen on your face, waiting for an invitation that never comes. Your hands ball into fists, nails biting crescents into your palms. You’ve practiced what to say, rehearsed the casual toss of a joke, but your throat tightens, sealing the words inside. When the bell rings, you turn away, telling yourself you prefer solitude anyway. The ache in your chest blooms like a dark flower, its roots twisting into the soil of every unspoken word.  

The hallway returns, but now the glass panes are cracking.  

You see yourself in the present, sitting across from a lover whose face is blurred, their hands reaching for yours. You flinch, not from fear, but from a deeper reflex—a muscle memory of withdrawal. The dream zooms in on your hands, trembling slightly, as if caught between two opposing tides: the urge to flee and the desperate hope to stay. Behind your eyes, a montage flashes: your father’s absences, the way he’d ruffle your hair without meeting your gaze; your grandmother’s hugs, warm but fleeting, like the last rays of sunset; the boy in third grade who promised to sit with you at lunch but forgot, leaving you alone with your half-eaten sandwich and a heart full of quiet betrayal.  

A voice whispers in the dream—not yours, but one that feels ancient and kind. *“You built walls before you knew you were building them,”* it says. *“You learned to love in the dark because that’s where you were taught to survive.”*  

The cracks in the glass widen, and light spills through—golden, molten, blinding. You see the patterns now: how you mirror your mother’s sharpness in arguments, how you retreat like your father when overwhelmed, how you apologize for existing in spaces you’ve earned. The revelations are not accusations but maps, tracing the labyrinth of your heart.  

The hallway dissolves.  

You’re standing in a field of tall grass, the sky above a kaleidoscope of twilight hues. A child version of yourself appears, clutching the one-eyed bear. You kneel, meeting their wary gaze. “It’s okay,” you murmur, your voice steady now. “You don’t have to be small anymore.” The child hesitates, then presses the bear into your hands. When you look up, they’re gone, but the grass around you is blooming with flowers—vivid, impossible colors, each petal a promise.  

You wake with a start, the weight of the dream clinging to you like a second skin. For the first time, the past feels less like a chain and more like a compass. The patterns are still there, but now you can name them, unravel them, stitch them into something new. The ache remains, but it’s softer now, a scar instead of a wound.  

And somewhere, deep in your chest, a door creaks open that you didn’t know was closed.
