I am dreaming. At first, it seems like an ordinary day, but the colors are more vibrant, and the world is slightly off-kilter, like a painter's brush hasn't quite finished stroking the canvas. I find myself in a grand art gallery, but the works displayed are not static; they're alive, shifting, and whispering in hues of blue and gold.

As I walk down the marbled hallway, I notice that the paintings are not the usual kind. They're vast, swirling expanses of color and form that mimic emotions. There's a painting of a stormy sea, Navy blues and steel greys churning, and as I approach, I can hear the echo of my mother's voice from years ago, "Don't be reckless, child." The waves seem to buffet me, warning, chiding.

I move on, drawn to a painting that's a burst of sunlight, daffodils, and laughter. It's warmth is tangible, like a physical embrace. I reach out to touch it, but my hand passes through, settling instead on a familiar weight in my pocket. A small pocketknife, a birthday gift from a friend. I remember the decision to carry it, my own conviction. Yet, now, it feels foreign, a millstone around my neck.

Suddenly, I'm not alone. Figures materialize from the paintings, people I've known, loved, lost. They're talking, not to me, but about me. They're discussing my life, my choices, as if I'm not there. Their words are like painting thinner, dissolving my once steadfast confidence.

"She used to be so sure," a voice like wind chimes echoes. I turn to see my grandmother, her eyes reflecting constellations of memories.

"But now, she seeks our approval," another voice, this one like thunder, rumbles. My old boss, his brow furrowed in concern. "She's faltering."

I try to speak, to protest, but my voice is trapped in my throat. I'm drowning in their expectations, their doubt. The gallery, once vast and grand, feels claustrophobic.

Then, a shift. A arm reaches out from a painting, a portrait of a woman with my eyes. She's wearing a soldier's uniform, her stance resolute. It's me, or rather, a version of me. She's not painted, she's carved, her features sharp, defined.

"Silence," she commands. The gallery quiets. "We know what it's like to doubt, to falter. But remember, we, You, made the decisions. We, You, believed in them. We, You, did not need our validation then, and You do not need it now."

Her voice is a drill, boring into my mind. She's right. The pocketknife, it's not a millstone, it's a tool, a symbol of my resourcefulness. The calculations, the risks, the triumphs and failures, they're mine, no one else's.

I feel a surge of determination. The gallery begins to fade, the figures blur and merge back into the paintings. As they do, I see that the pictures are not just reflections of emotions past, but portents of those to come. I reach out, not to touch, but to influence. The waves of the stormy sea calm at my touch, the sunlight painting brightens, Then, I'm awake.

My heart is pounding, but my resolve is steeled. I made the decisions. I am the one who decides their worth. I don't need external validation. I have my own voice, my own compass. I am enough. And with that, I step into the day ahead, ready to paint my own vibrant, vivid world.
