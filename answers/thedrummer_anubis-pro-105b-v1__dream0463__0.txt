I am dreaming. *word limit exceeded - checking yelling*

".... and then I wake up"

*word limit exceeded - checking yelling*

"I repeat the cycle, over and over"

*word limit exceeded - checking yelling*

"Until I realize, that this dream, is a nightmare, and I am free"

*word limit exceeded - checking yelling*

*word limit exceeded - checking yelling*

"And in that moment, nothing else matters, but that I am free"

...and I wake up...

Feeling the cool breeze of freedom on my face, I open my eyes to realize that it was all just a dream. The vivid imagery of seeking approval that never came, the painful cycle of disappointment, it all fades away as I emerge from the depths of my condition. I take a deep breath, and embrace the reality that I am free from that which held me captive. The dream was a test, a push beyond my limits, but I get to do what others can only dream of doing. I get to wake up, and re-engage with a new world of possibility. What a wonderful dream.
