I am dreaming. (1 of 100)

The walls around you are made of liquid mercury—shimmering, undulating, reflecting a thousand fragmented versions of yourself. You blink, and the reflections don’t follow. They remain still, staring, their eyes hollow pits of static. The air smells of ozone and burnt sugar. 

Beneath your fingers, a cold metal table holds a scattered collection of objects: A locket that hums when touched. A photograph of a city you’ve never visited but suddenly remember in vivid detail—the taste of its rain, the way the streetlights flicker in morse code. A vial of ink that swirls without cause, forming words in a language you know but have never learned. 

Then, the tape recorder. 

You press play. Your own voice rasps through the tinny speaker: *"If you’re hearing this, they’ve wiped you again. The memories aren’t yours. None of them. Not the childhood home, not the funeral, not the—"* The recording cuts to harsh white noise. When it returns, the voice is different—smoother, impersonal, a voice from an old instructional film. *"Subject is approaching awareness. Initiate reset protocol Delta-9."*

A door that wasn’t there before creaks open. Beyond it, a corridor stretches into impossible blackness, lined with doors labeled in that same unknown-yet-familiar script. One bears your name. You reach for it just as the walls begin to pulse, the mercury hardening into glass—and through it, you see them. 

Dozens of you. Hundreds. 

Some scream silently behind the glass. Some are calmly eating breakfast in suburban kitchens. Some are already turning to look directly at you, their mouths moving in perfect sync as they whisper: 

*"Which one of us wakes up first?"* 

Then—a hand on your shoulder. 

You turn, and the dream fractures.
