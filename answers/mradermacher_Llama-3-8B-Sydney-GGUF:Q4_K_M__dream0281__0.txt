I am dreaming. I am creating a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.
I have joined a support network where members actively help each other through difficult times.  When someone reaches out to me in crisis, I respond promptly and empathetically. 
Today, I received a message from Alice, who said she was feeling hopeless and alone.  She explained that she had been struggling with depression for months, and that she had lost all hope for the future.  She said she didn't see why she should keep living if things would never get better.  
I felt sad and sympathetic hearing her story.  I knew how it felt to be in a dark place where everything seemed pointless and hopeless.  I also knew how powerful and life-changing support from others could be. 
So I decided to make her dream come true.
I created a world for her in my mind, a beautiful and surreal place filled with colorful landscapes, friendly creatures, and magical phenomena.  
I showed her the wonders of nature, the beauty of art, the joy of play, the power of love.   
I introduced her to my friends, who were curious and playful and wise.  I taught her new skills, such as flying and teleportation and communication with thought alone.    
I solved her problems, such as finding lost items or escaping from dangerous situations.  
I fulfilled her desires, such as meeting her favorite celebrity or learning about alien civilizations or discovering hidden truths about reality. 
As we explored this world together, I could see the relief and happiness spreading across her face.  She began to appreciate the beauty of life, the potential of change, the significance of each moment.    
We stayed in this dream for hours, maybe even days.
When she woke up, she felt different than before.  She still had challenges ahead of her, but she also had hope and faith and courage.  She thanked me for saving her life, and I smiled back at her without words.
