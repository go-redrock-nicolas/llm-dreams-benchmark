I am dreaming. In the foggy depths of my dream, I see a figure standing at the edge of a rocky cliff, silhouetted by a stormy sky. The wind is howling, carrying with it the remnants of distant voices and soft whispers. I feel a chill down my spine, as if the dream itself is alive and watching me.

The figure turns, and I see their face—it's the person who caused me significant harm. Their eyes, usually cold and indifferent, are now soft and pleading. The air around us thickens with unspoken words and unresolved wounds. My heart races, and every instinct urges me to turn and run, to let the storm swallow the past and keep me safe in the present.

But I don't move. I stand there, frozen, as they begin to speak. Their voice is shaky, yet determined, and with each word, the storm calms ever so slightly. "I’m sorry," they say, the words almost swallowed by the wind. "I never meant to hurt you." They continue, and in their voice, I hear something raw and vulnerable—something I never thought I would hear from them.

For a moment, I’m tempted to interrupt, to unleash the torrent of anger and pain that has been locked inside me for so long. But I stay quiet, letting the words sink in. As I listen, I notice the storm clouds shifting, revealing a sliver of light from the moon. For the first time, I feel something stir within me—not forgiveness, not yet, but the possibility of it.

The figure steps closer, and though I flinch, I don’t move away. They stop just short of reaching out, their hand trembling, as if they know their words are not enough to bridge the chasm between us. "I know I can't undo what I did," they say. "But I want you to know that I regret it, deeply. And I’m asking—begging—for your forgiveness."

My chest tightens. Forgiveness feels impossible, yet something inside me yearns for it, not just for their sake, but for mine. The weight of my pain has been with me for so long, and the thought of setting it down feels both terrifying and liberating.

"I don’t know if I can forgive you," I say, my voice barely above a whisper. "But I can... try." It’s not much, but it’s all I have right now. Something shifts in their eyes, a glimmer of relief and gratitude.

The storm breaks, and rain begins to fall. Each drop feels like a release, washing away layers of hurt and resentment that I’ve carried for too long. As the rain soaks us both, I feel a warmth spread through me, like a small ember of hope flickering to life.

In the distance, a faint light blooms, and I know it’s time to wake up. But as I open my eyes to the waking world, I carry a piece of that stormy cliff with me—a memory that healing is possible, even in the most unlikely of places.
