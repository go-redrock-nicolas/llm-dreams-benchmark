I am dreaming. …close my eyes inside the dream and step backward, away from the fever-bright conference chamber where diplomats shriek like tropical birds, into a hallway of mind-stuff where every footstep splashes ink across the floor. The factions—the Emberborne in their living bronze carapaces and the Frostweld swathed in whisper-cold mist—have just spat back my neat little twelve-point treaty as though I’d offered them poison. Their rejection still rings in my ears like cracked bells.

I let the walls melt.

Suddenly I stand atop an impossible bridge, spun of constellation-dust, strung between two twin moons that orbit each other like locked hearts. Beneath, the planet glows with scar tissue: trenches that gleam red, glaciers pocked with melted craters, cities clinging like barnacles to jagged coasts. History’s wounds are visible from orbit.

The Emberborne arrive first, their armor radiating copper heat, braziers flickering in the sockets where helmets should have eyes. The Frostweld drift up moments later, borne on glacial thermals, cloaks of hoarfrost scribbling glyphs in the air. They face each other across the spine of the bridge, too proud to advance, too furious to withdraw. Every silence between them is a millennium of outrage.

I unroll a tapestry made from my own dream-veins and pin it to the star-wind. Its threads are memories I stole (gently) while they shouted earlier: lullabies sung in ruined nurseries, recipes for bread no longer baked, love letters scorched by shellfire. The fabric shivers in the cosmic draft, and holograms bloom—children of Ember and Frost holding hands before mortar blasts, a wedding cut in half by avalanche artillery, harvest festivals turned to ash and salt. Neither side can look away; their histories tangle, identical in grief if not in accent.

Still, their leaders resist. One Ember general cracks charcoal knuckles and growls, “Pity stings, but it does not heal.” A Frost archivist wipes crystalline tears and hisses, “Shared sorrow is a candle guttering in hurricane winds.”

Time to dive deeper.

I yank the moons closer with dream-strength until their gravities overlap, forming a trembling sphere where the past is physical. The bridge folds, curls, becomes a Möbius strip, sweeping all of us inside a labyrinth built of simultaneous yesterdays—tunnels lined with echoing battle cries, rooms snowing down spent bullet casings that sprout into iron poppies. No one can tell whose horror came first. Cause and retaliation spiral like mirrored snakes.

Inside that tidal knot of history I set a single door: plain wood, faded paint, a childish scrawl across the frame—HOME. “Enter together,” I say, “or not at all. Behind it is the only patch of ground neither side has stained.”

They hesitate. Rage is comfortable; forgiveness burns. Eventually two mid-rank envoys—one Ember medic with soot on her cheek, one Frost mechanic scarred by coolant frostbite—step forward. They clasp the knob simultaneously. Light wells up, shy as dawn. When the door creaks open we are standing on untouched soil: vibrant grass that hums with chlorophyll lullabies, a brook speaking in silver syllables, clouds shaped like questions rather than wounds.

The soldiers behind them stare, realize nothing collapses when enemies share a sky, and funnel through. Their boots press no trenches; their armor drips to the ground like husks, revealing tired skin, freckles, sweat, tears. In that naked meadow I plant a seed—literally: an iridescent kernel that contains, in fractal micro-script, every compromise they refused. I water it with the combined dust of their burnt archives. A tree erupts, trunk swirling with both their sigils, branches bearing fruits of alloy and ice, juxtaposed flavors blending into something startling and sweet.

They taste it and blink awake. Centuries clatter off their shoulders. An Ember elder slumps to her knees, heat leaking harmlessly into the soil. A Frost captain cups a warm fruit half and laughs—a brittle sound at first, then ringing with genuine wonder.

I decree, with the lucidity only a dream grants, that the tree shall be border, treaty, and memory: its roots drinking ashes, its canopy distilling mist—neither side able to forget, neither able to continue. They agree, not because I command but because the meadow feels more truthful than their myths.

Back on the bridge (the labyrinth unspools behind us, sighing shut), the generals sign the new accord on parchment made from the tree’s first fallen leaf. Their signatures shimmer, half flame, half frost—melding into vapor that rises like a newborn constellation.

I exhale. My lungs release fireflies. As the factions depart—some glancing back in stunned gratitude, others still stubborn but quiet—I taste the fruit myself. It is heartbreak and sunrise, bitter rind, honeyed core.

Then the moons separate, the bridge dissolves, and I begin to fall, sleep within sleep, certain that when I wake the world below will have one bright, tender scar instead of two bleeding empires.

Somewhere in the drift downward, the dream whispers:

Remember: peace is not an end. It is a fragile door that must be reopened every dawn.
