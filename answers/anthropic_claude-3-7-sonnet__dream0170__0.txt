I am dreaming. # The Tournament of Echoes

I find myself standing at the threshold of a vast amphitheater carved from living crystal, its faceted walls refracting light in hypnotic patterns that seem to pulse with the collective heartbeats of the thousands gathered within. The air tastes of anticipation—metallic and sweet—as I nervously adjust the ceremonial garments draped across my shoulders.

This is the Championship of Echoes, the final round of a tournament I somehow entered despite my novice status. Around me stand legends—masters who have spent decades perfecting the ancient art of Dream Weaving, where competitors craft living narratives from the very fabric of shared consciousness.

My opponents' hands glow with practiced energy. The woman to my left, her eyes opalescent and ancient despite her youthful appearance, has woven dreams for emperors. The man across the arena floor—skin etched with luminous sigils—reportedly spent thirty years meditating in the Dream Caverns, learning to manipulate the invisible threads of collective imagination.

And yet, here I stand.

The Grand Arbiter, a figure whose face constantly shifts between those of everyone I've ever known, raises a crystalline staff. "Finalists, prepare your looms," the voice reverberates, somehow both thunderous and whispered directly into my mind.

My fingers tremble as I reach out, feeling the invisible warp and weft of potential stories humming between my palms. Unlike the others, whose movements are precise and confident, I follow only intuition—a strange familiarity with this art I've never formally studied.

The crystal dome above opens to reveal a night sky impossibly close, stars swirling like embers from a cosmic fire. These are our materials—fragments of universal dreams, waiting to be woven.

As my hands move through the air, stories begin to materialize around me—not the polished narratives of my competitors, but raw, primal visions pulsing with unrefined emotion. Somehow, in my untrained state, I'm tapping into something deeper than technique, something that resonates with the audience in ways that perfect mastery cannot.

The tournament continues, the very air becoming thick with interweaving realities, and despite my inexperience, I find myself advancing—guided by some forgotten wisdom that feels both new and impossibly ancient...
