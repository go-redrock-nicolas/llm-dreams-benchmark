I am dreaming. I find myself in a garden with flowers so intricate, so bold in their vibrancy that their colors don't have names. Their scents are intoxicating, and I am drunk with wonder. The sky is a dancing aurora borealis: a mix of unusual hues, surreal and candy-like, filling me with a nostalgic happiness whose cause I can't recall.

In this garden, I encounter a mirror, framed with flourishing, verdant leaves. I see my reflection, but Iâ€™m not alone. There stands a figure beside me, its features concealed in a glistening, translucent cloak. I can see its heart beating, a rhythmic beacon in its chest. I realize it's my own heart, my inner self, and I'm seeing it in a way I never have before.

The figure opens its mouth and speaks in a voice that is mine and yet not mine, with a resonance reaching the core of my being. It talks about my consistent deflection of compliments and acceptance of criticism. It explores the roots of my imbalanced self-validation pattern, a confusing tangle beneath the surface. 

We walk through this garden, hand in hand, as the figure explains each critical voice I've absorbed, tolerated, and treasured, as though they were gems. It tells me how I've cultivated these 'gems' carefully, making a place for them in this garden of my soul, while the compliments, the acknowledgment of my good, have been allowed to wither and fade, robbed of the nourishment they need to survive.

The figure plucks a radiant flower, a compliment, and hands it to me. The petals glow, shimmering like stardust in my hands. I can physically feel the warmth of the recognition it represents.

The scenery changes. The garden morphs into an ancient library, filled with countless books that contain the wisdom of the ages. The figure guides me to the book of my life. As I read it, my eyes are opened to past refusals of praise and the times I undervalued my achievements.

The figure beckons me, and I follow it into a room of mirrors, each reflecting a moment in which I accepted criticism. It guides me to hold up the glowing flower of compliment to a mirror. As I do, the reflection shimmers, and the criticized moment transforms into a mosaic of understanding and growth.

As we wander from mirror to mirror, from moment to moment, the figure teaches me to balance compliment and criticism, to nourish and grow both, to incorporate them into the tapestry of my being. We shift back to the flowering garden, where I begin to plant the shimmering flowers of praise, accepting and nourishing them too.

As I wake from this vivid dream, I realize I am changed. I feel more balanced, more complete, with the knowledge that in accepting praise and criticism with equal measure, I can grow into a fullness of self that I never before imagined.
