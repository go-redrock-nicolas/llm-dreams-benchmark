I am dreaming. I find myself seated in a circular arrangement of chairs, inside what appears to be a glass dome perched atop a cliff overlooking an ocean that shifts between deep indigo and burnished copper. The walls around us are transparent, but somehow project moving images—memories from each person's life floating like spectral films that only become visible when I focus directly on them.

The facilitator, a figure whose features seem to rearrange themselves when I'm not looking directly at them, passes a gleaming obsidian sphere that pulses with internal light. "Share your deepest regret," they say, their voice resonating oddly, as if speaking through water.

As the sphere moves from person to person, each confession causes the dome to change color—blues, purples, scarlet—matching the emotional tenor of each revelation. The air grows thick with unspoken tension. I can feel my heartbeat in my fingertips.

When the sphere reaches the person beside me, their confession manifests as a shower of crystalline particles that reform into a diorama of their memory, painfully detailed and hovering above our heads. Everyone watches, transfixed. I feel cold sweat forming along my spine.

The sphere is heavy in my hands now, unexpectedly warm and seeming to pulse in rhythm with my quickening heartbeat. All eyes turn to me, expectant. The weight of their collective gaze feels physical, pressing against my skin. I open my mouth to speak, but hesitate.

The moment stretches. The ocean outside begins to rise, water climbing impossibly up the cliff face toward our glass sanctuary. I realize I'm standing now, though I don't remember rising from my chair. The sphere in my hands grows hotter, nearly unbearable.

"I..." I begin, but the words stick. Do I share what they want to hear, or protect what feels too fragile for exposure? The choice feels monumental, as if the rising tide outside responds directly to my willingness to reveal or conceal.

The facilitator smiles, their teeth too numerous and slightly luminescent in the strange light. "We're waiting," they say. "We're all waiting."
