I am dreaming. …take one more step and feel the whole world tilt beneath your boots. The wind lunges like a living thing, clawing at the edges of your parka, trying to peel you from the spine of stone on which you balance. Every snowflake is a needle of frozen starlight; they stitch themselves into your eyelashes until the world begins to shutter open and closed like an old film reel.  

A heartbeat later, the ridge vanishes. There is no tidy transition—one blink and earth has been replaced by a bridge of shimmering ice, glass-clear and flecked with what looks like constellations trapped inside. The blizzard keeps roaring, yet not a single flake lands upon this bridge; they all swirl around it in a furious halo, as if an invisible dome is protecting the path. You place a tentative boot down. Instead of slipping, you feel a warmth seep upward through the sole, trickling into your bones, returning sensation to your frozen toes.

Ahead, the bridge arcs toward a gate carved from the roots of the mountain itself: two gigantic doors fashioned from petrified wood, veined with veins of blue-white quartz that pulse like a slowed heartbeat. Carved into the grain are countless figures—some human, some impossibly elongated, some winged and faceless—locked in a silent procession toward a single eye that stares from the gate’s center. Snow collects in the hollows of their cheeks and eye sockets, lending them a tragic dignity.

You raise your gloved hand and the gate responds before you can touch it. The doors inhale, expanding outward, exhaling with a rumble that shakes loose centuries of frost. A gold-lit fog spills out, carrying the scent of pine sap and distant summer thunderstorms. It is warm, and it hums with a note so low you feel it humming in your teeth.

Inside, the world has inverted. Instead of a cavern, you step into an open sky—an upside-down firmament beneath your boots where clouds roll below like soft marble. Islands of green meadow float in the air, connected by chains of singing crystal. Phosphorescent wolves, translucent as moonlight, trot along those chains and pause to regard you with eyes that hold small galaxies. One of them tilts its head, and from its throat comes the echo of your name spoken backward. You realize, with a quiet jolt, that you understand it perfectly.

An obsidian feather flutters down from nowhere and lands in your palm, warm as a living heart. The moment you close your fingers around it, the blizzard’s roar outside fades to a distant ocean hush. Your parka unravels into a cape of mirrored snowflakes that refuse to melt; the wolves bow. Somewhere overhead—though there is no true “above” in this reoriented realm—the aurora shatters into birds of emerald glass that wheel and reform, spelling a single shimmering command: “REMEMBER.”

A bell tolls, deep and resonant, vibrating the air so thoroughly that the floating islands tremble like plucked harp strings. The crystal chains begin to realign, forming a spiral staircase that invites you upward—or perhaps downward—toward a sun that is both setting and rising at once.

With the obsidian feather pressed to your heart, you step forward, certain of nothing except this: you are awake inside the dream, and whatever awaits at the staircase’s apex is something you have spent lifetimes yearning to meet.
