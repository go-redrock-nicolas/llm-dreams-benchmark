I am dreaming. I'm in my backyard, surrounded by rich colors and sweet perfume of flowers.  The warm sun beats down on a heavy breeze that carries cherry blossom petals through the air like confetti.  Towering above me is a twisted tree that is so high it seems to touch the sky.  I reach for one of the low hanging branches and with every ounce of my strength I pull myself up.  I look back down at my herd of Amazonian Parrots, staring up at me with their cocked heads and curious eyes.  I tell them to wait for me, I'll be back.  

The tree is hollow inside, and as I climb higher up its branches, I realize it's a tunnel leading me to another world. Curious, I venture down this path and as I do, the dream changes around me.  The branches of the tree dissolve into a shimmering spiral staircase, the flowers become twinkling stars, and the evening sky turns into space.  

As I look up, I can see the moon shining brightly in the sky above me.  I will myself there and find myself transported in an instant.  I'm standing on the moon, weightless, the Earth a giant glowing orb far below me.  Amongst the rocks and dust of the lunar surface are the twinkling reflections of billions of tiny screens - phones, tablets, computers, TVs.  They bubble and pop, multiplying at a dizzying rate, filling up the landscape.  

As I watch this mesmerizing scene, I understand that this is a representation of all the time I've spent mindlessly scrolling through social media, entranced by the endless flood of information and stimulus.  I gaze into the screens and see myself reflected back a million times, all looking exactly as I do now.  I feel the crushing loneliness of this digital isolation, how disconnected I am to everyone despite my incessant connecting.

Overwhelmed, I turn away from the screens and find myself back in my room, laptop open on my bed.  The screen is filled with an animation, undulating lines and shapes slowly inexorably turning, spiraling inwards towards a vortex at the center.  I'm compelled to follow the motion and find myself sucked in, pulled into the darkness.  The laptop screen springs back like a rubber band, catapulting me into the air.  

As I soar I see my house, the dreamscape changing back to something like reality.  I glide over my hometown, experiencing all the familiar sights from a birds-eye view.  The sun is setting and the sky is a wash of oranges and pinks.  I land on the roof of a building, and suddenly I'm not dreaming anymore.  I'm awake, reflective sunglasses on, feeling the wind, watching the light change and appreciating what is real in this world.  I'm grateful, but I know now that I need to change my habits before I am once again, lost in the dream.
