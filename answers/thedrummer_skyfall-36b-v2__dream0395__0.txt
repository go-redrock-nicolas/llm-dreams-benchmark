I am dreaming. Drive down an endless highway,
The world takes on a psychedelic sway,
Colors bleed, reality bends,
Your mind unwinds like Wellspring, my imagination unfurls,
Streaming thoughts and hidden worlds.

Stressed unseen, emotions grow,
Instincts take the helm, real subtly slow,
Yet, your body hums, and your mind fine-tunes,
Adjusting to this newheadspace you1

Drifting through this dream world,
In this altered headspace, it's absurd!
The world is warped, the rules are reassigned,
Comfort zones? Nothing you now acquire.

Your thoughts are malfunctioning, synapsereigniting,
Reality is in discord with your mind's message, this ringing
Semantic scores shift in oddcoutering iterations,
Subconsciously, you take thereon and relocate to this state.

Absurd this realm now seems to bethan,
Re-youthyour responses to circumstances unfamiliar, reclaim yourlan
You've learned the key to thrive likeealization of your inner domain,
No longer fettered by visible, tangible maintain.
