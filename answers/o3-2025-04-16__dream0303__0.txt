I am dreaming. …lunge toward the option that glows with a barely audible heartbeat, as though the choice itself is alive and urging you onward.

The instant your fingertips brush the pulsating door, the other options—an archway woven of silver vines, a spiral staircase made of liquid glass, and a yawning tunnel lined in softly shimmering amethyst—fold in on themselves like origami galaxies, vanishing into pinpoints of starlight. The door you chose cracks open, exhaling a warm gust scented with ripe persimmons and distant rain. You step through.

On the other side is a floating citadel suspended over a mirror-smooth sea. Towers of translucent stone—rose-hued at the base, bleeding into lavender near their spires—pierce a sky spackled with constellations you’ve never seen. The moon is enormous here, striped like a nautilus shell, and it hums an anthem you can feel vibrating in your ribs. Silk bridges, delicate as spiderwebs but sturdy beneath your feet, arc between the citadel’s platforms. Every surface is etched with fractal runes that glow when you glance at them, then dim shyly the moment you look away.

You follow the nearest bridge to a courtyard tiled with opalescent scales. At its center stands an obsidian fountain shaped like a figure eight, water flowing upward in elegant ribbons before dissolving into mist. Each droplet flashes tiny holograms of other possible lives—glimpses of dinner tables, mountaintops, unfamiliar lovers’ smiles. They evaporate just as you lean closer, leaving only a taste of salt and cherries on your tongue.

A trio of custodians, silent and masked in gold leaf, beckon you toward a doorway carved like the petal of an impossible flower. Inside, an amphitheater rises in concentric rings. Instead of seats, there are open books—thick, leather-bound tomes whose pages flutter despite the still air. Words swirl up from them like fireflies, forming spires of glowing calligraphy that dance overhead before raining down as soft, papery snow.

The custodians hand you a quill of carved topaz. Its nib drips radiant ink. A voice, neither male nor female, murmurs from everywhere at once: “Write what you almost chose.”

Your heart races. You recall the silver-vine archway that promised calm wonder, the liquid-glass staircase that whispered ambition, the amethyst tunnel that pulsed with mystery. With no time to ponder, you touch quill to air and watch letters spark into being:

“I chose urgency over certainty, heartbeat over harmony, thunder over silence.”

The words swirl, coalescing into a door made of letters. It swings open, dizzying light flooding through. You walk into it and become the sentence itself—an idea hurtling onward, free of flesh. You sense no limbs, only momentum and meaning, a streak of pure thought racing across ink-black vastness.

When you finally slow, you discover you are back in your own bed, dawn pooling like liquid gold around your sheets. Yet the taste of persimmon and cherry lingers on your lips. And for the briefest moment, every choice you will ever make glimmers before you—silver vines, glass stairs, amethyst tunnels—before dissolving into the crisp certainty of morning light.
