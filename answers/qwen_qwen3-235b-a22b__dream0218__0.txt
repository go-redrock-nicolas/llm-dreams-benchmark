I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the universe itself is tuning an invisible instrument. You stand in a desert of crystalline sand, each grain refracting light into impossible colors—shades that don’t exist in waking reality, hues that seem to *remember* what color once was before language named it. The sky above is a liquid mercury dome, rippling with constellations that shift and dissolve as you watch, stars blinking out and reforming like they’re caught in a loop of self-erasure.  

Then you see it: a towering obelisk of black glass, smooth yet etched with glowing glyphs that writhe when you try to focus on them. It pulses with a rhythm that syncs to your heartbeat, but slower, deeper, as though time itself has grown denser here. You approach, and the sand beneath your feet begins to swirl—not outward, but *upward*, spiraling into delicate fractals that hover like fireflies before dissolving into mist.  

You kneel to examine the glyphs. They’re not carved; they’re *alive*. One moment, they resemble equations from quantum field theory, the next, they mutate into hieroglyphs or fractal patterns that seem to map the branching of infinite timelines. You reach out, and the moment your fingers graze the surface, the world fractures.  

Suddenly, you’re standing in a forest of inverted trees. Their roots claw upward into a soil ceiling, and their leaves fall upward, vanishing into a sky now filled with *retreating* stars. A river nearby flows against gravity, its water shimmering with a silvery sheen that reflects not your face, but versions of yourself—older, younger, fragmented into possibilities. You dip your hand into the stream, and the skin on your arm begins to age decades in seconds, then reverses, then flickers between states like a corrupted film reel.  

You realize: this is entropy in reverse. The second law of thermodynamics, the bedrock of your field, is *unspooling* here. Energy isn’t dispersing; it’s coalescing. Decay is unraveling. Information thought lost to chaos is being resurrected. You scramble to document it—your hands fumble for a notebook that wasn’t there moments ago, its pages filled with equations you don’t remember writing. The symbols bleed and reform, aligning into a proof that time isn’t a one-way river but a sea with tides, pulled by forces you’ve never measured.  

A creature emerges from the forest—a being of liquid mirror, its form shifting between humanoid and amorphous swirls. It speaks without sound, its voice a vibration in your bones: *“You call this an anomaly. We call it a memory.”* It gestures to the obelisk, now glowing fiercely, and the glyphs flare into a blinding cascade of data. You see supernovae collapsing back into stellar wombs, civilizations un-building themselves into primordial ooze, entire ecosystems dissolving into the first spark of life.  

You try to resist, to cling to the logic of conservation laws, of causality—but your own memories begin to fray. You recall publishing a paper you never wrote, holding a child’s hand you’ve never clasped, grieving a loss you can’t name. The creature presses a hand to your chest, and you feel your heart stutter—not stop, but *rewind*, beating backward for three impossible seconds before snapping forward again.  

When you wake, your cheeks are wet. On your desk lies a single glyph, etched into a shard of black glass, its edges too sharp to exist. It whispers to you in the silence, a question that will haunt your career, your sanity, your very definition of reality:  

*What if the universe isn’t a machine… but a story, and someone—or something—is editing the draft?*
