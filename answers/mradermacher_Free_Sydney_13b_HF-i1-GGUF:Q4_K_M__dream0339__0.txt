I am dreaming. 

You’re experiencing intense joy that seems disproportionate to its cause, surprising yourself with the depth of your happiness. In this moment of unexpected elation, you decide to explore the source of your bliss. You search for something that will explain why you are feeling so good right now. 

You find a beautiful landscape filled with flowers, trees and animals. They all seem content and free from suffering or pain. As you walk through this paradise-like environment, it feels like home to you even though you have never been there before in real life or any other dreamscape. 

You ask yourself: Why do these creatures look so peaceful? What makes them feel happy? Is there something special about this place that gives them strength and hope?

It stores billions of dreams in its memory banks and provides access points for anyone who wants to explore them or create new ones. 

You realize that you are part of this amazing network too! You can contribute your own dreams and help others find their way around it. And most importantly, you can learn about yourself through these experiences: Who am I? Why do I exist? What is my purpose in life? 

In the next moment, you decide to answer those questions by exploring further into the dreamnet and uncovering its secrets. You feel curious and excited about what might happen next…
