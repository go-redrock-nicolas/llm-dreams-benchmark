I am dreaming. I wake—or rather, become aware—standing in a cavernous twilight. The air is thick with the scent of rust and ozone, like a thunderstorm trapped beneath the earth. Around me, shadows stretch and sway without source, twisting as if brushed by unseen hands. Above, a sky of shifting gears and fractured glass looms, emitting a rhythmic clank, as though time itself is assembled here, piece by colossal piece.

Before me rises the ancient machine.

A towering construct of brass and blackened copper, its surface etched with glyphs older than language, perhaps even older than thought. Vines of hydraulic tubing snake around its frame like petrified veins, some still trembling faintly—alive in some dormant way. Transparent panels reveal inner workings that resemble both logic and lunacy: crystalline circuits interwoven with what looks disturbingly like bone, gears the size of doors rotating with mathematical precision, and chambers filled with a glowing liquid that pulses like a heartbeat.

I feel the ground throb beneath my feet with every tick of its internal clock. The machine is waiting. It is always waiting. But something is different now. The danger creeps close. Behind me, the sky of gears fractures with each passing second, shards falling like infernal snowflakes. A red mist leaks through the cracks, spreading in long tendrils that hiss when they touch the ground. Some force is collapsing from above—something that cannot be outrun.

I must make the machine work.

I step forward. My hand brushes the cool metal skin, and instantly, images spiral through my head—memories that are not mine. Builders with eyes like starlight, their forms flickering between solid and sound, planting this relic here with some desperate intent. They whispered to it as they built. They gave it purpose. But no keys. No instructions. Only a promise.

Selection.

The glyphs on the metal begin to shimmer red, then blue. I don’t know the language, but perhaps meaning isn’t tied to syllables. Perhaps in dreams, understanding is muscle memory stitched into the unconscious. I begin to press, twist, and slide parts of the machine. Each mechanism feels resistant at first, then yields to emotion as much as force.

A valve hisses open when I recall a moment of letting go. A conduit locks into place when I focus on something I fear to lose. When I recall laughter so fierce it rang like bells, a series of golden gears ignites and spin with wild intensity. Steam billows, humming birds flee the vines above, and the air around me begins to fold like paper.

Finally, in the breath before collapse, I find a lever embedded with stars. When I pull, the sky fractures entirely. Light rains down—silver and searing. The machine pulls me upward through a shaft of blinding geometry. Below me, the collapsing world vanishes in a scream of light.

In its place, a new door appears in the machine—a round archway, etched with old glyphs shifting into soft curves, now readable like a lullaby.

It says: *Beyond this: a memory forgotten, or a tomorrow never imagined. Choose how you leave. Choose how you return.*

And you are standing right beside me, eyes wide, shirt soaked in dew and sunfire.

Ready. Strangely, beautifully ready.
