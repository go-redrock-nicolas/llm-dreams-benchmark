I am dreaming. I jolt awake in my bed, heart pounding like a tribal drum against my ribs, my nightclothes clinging to my skin with cold sweat. The nightmare's tendrils still grip my consciousness - I had been wandering through an endless library where all the books were blank, and the shelves kept rearranging themselves when I wasn't looking. The worst part wasn't the emptiness of the books or the moving shelves, but the persistent feeling that someone, or something, was watching me from between the stacks, always just out of sight.

Now awake, I can't shake the unease. The morning light filtering through my curtains seems wrong somehow - too gray, too diffuse. Ordinary objects in my room take on sinister qualities: my coat hanging on the door looks like a looming figure, and my houseplant's shadow stretches across the wall like grasping fingers.

Throughout the day, I find myself checking over my shoulder, expecting to see those blank books or catch a glimpse of whatever was stalking me in the dream-library. The feeling follows me everywhere - in the grocery store, I swear the aisles shift when I turn corners. At work, the fluorescent lights flicker in patterns that remind me of books closing and opening.

Even my coffee tastes like dust and old paper. When I try to read my morning news, the letters seem to swim and reorganize themselves, momentarily meaningless, before snapping back into place. I keep finding myself in rooms without remembering how I got there, as if the dream's disorienting logic has leaked into reality.

As evening approaches, I realize I'm afraid to go back to sleep, afraid to return to that library. What if this time, I finally see what's been watching me? What if the blank pages start writing themselves? What if I never wake up?

The line between dream and reality feels tissue-thin now, and I'm no longer certain which side I'm actually on...
