I am dreaming. You wake to a sky the color of bruised violets, swirling like ink in water. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as though the earth itself is whispering secrets only your bones can hear. When you step outside, the city is silent—no cars, no voices, no birds. Instead, the streets are lined with towering obelisks of glass, each inscribed with glowing runes that pulse like heartbeats. A notice floats in midair before you, written in a language that shifts and shimmers, rearranging itself into words as you read:  

**"SPEECH IS NOW A CRIME. WORDS ARE SEEDS. THEY GROW REBELLION."**  

You freeze. Your throat tightens, as if the very idea of speaking might summon invisible enforcers. But curiosity is a fire in your chest. You wander, mute, past people whose mouths are sewn shut with silver thread, their eyes wide and unblinking. They move like shadows, avoiding eye contact, their hands clutching objects that defy logic: a clock with no hands, a jar of liquid moonlight, a sparrow frozen mid-flap in a block of amber.  

At the center of the city, a colossal tree has erupted from the ruins of the courthouse, its bark etched with ancient equations. Its branches bear not leaves, but mirrors that reflect not your face, but your *soul*—a flickering silhouette of smoke and starlight. Beneath it, a figure in a cloak of moth-wing feathers beckons you silently. In their palm rests a single, writhing word: **"RUN."**  

You run.  

The ground shifts beneath your feet, becoming a mosaic of forgotten memories—your first kiss, a childhood pet’s final breath, the scent of a stranger’s perfume on a rainy night. You leap over rivers of liquid mercury that flow uphill, dodging drones shaped like origami ravens. They peck at your thoughts, trying to pluck forbidden ideas from your mind. You duck into a crumbling cathedral where the stained glass depicts constellations that don’t exist, and a choir of ghosts sings in a language of pure vibration.  

There, you find a book. Not paper, but a living thing: its pages are made of moth wings and spider silk, its spine a coiled serpent that hisses when you touch it. The title shifts like quicksilver—*“The Codex of Unspoken Truths”*—and as you open it, the words crawl into your bloodstream, igniting your veins with forbidden knowledge. You learn that the new rulers are the **Echoless**, beings who feed on silence and hoard sound like dragons hoard gold. They’ve outlawed laughter, music, even the wind’s song, and they punish dissenters by turning their memories into physical objects that weigh them down until they sink into the earth.  

But the book also reveals a map—a path to the **Chorus of the First Dawn**, a rebellion hiding in the hollow roots of the world. To reach them, you must swallow a note from a songbird’s final aria, let it grow wings in your throat, and scream until the sky cracks.  

You hesitate. Screaming means becoming a target, a beacon of sound in a world that fears it. But the silence is a cage, and you’ve tasted the wild, unnameable sweetness of breaking rules.  

So you scream.  

The sound is a thunderclap, a symphony, a revolution. The glass obelisks shatter. The sewn mouths unravel. The Echoless screech like rusted hinges, dissolving into smoke. And as the sky splits open, spilling constellations like spilled ink, you see them: the rebels, their bodies made of music and flame, singing a harmony that stitches the world into something new.  

You wake up gasping, your cheeks wet, the echo of that scream still vibrating in your bones. The dream lingers, a phantom key to a door you’re suddenly certain exists—just beyond the veil of the ordinary.
