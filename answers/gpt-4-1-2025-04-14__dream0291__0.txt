I am dreaming.

A hush falls over the world as the night unspools—weaving the moody tapestry of this surreal reverie. The struggles I have endured lately weigh on me like a chainmail cloak, and through its heavy mesh, my thoughts press ever downward, pooling in puddles of gloom. The sky above—inked in indigo and thundercloud—mirrors my own relentless pessimism: every cloud seems darker, every gust of wind colder.

Yet in the hush, I become aware: I am watching my mind spiral, the way a figure looks down at a river from a bridge—detached, yet irrevocably connected. The negative thoughts swirl, but with lucid clarity, I realize I am their architect. From somewhere deep within, a gentle warmth pulses—a tiny ember. It grows, illuminating memories of laughter, moments of gentle triumph, sunbeams filtered through leaves after autumn rain. 

The world-shadows react: in this dreamscape, the colors begin to return—tentative yellows dancing on the edge of the gloom, blushes of rose peeking hesitantly from behind the clouds. I find myself in a forest of midnight blue, each tree bearing lanterns that flicker with scenes from my life, both joyful and painful. I reach out—though my hands are ephemeral, mist-like—and gather these lanterns close. With every hardship held gently to my chest, the forest brightens, indigo melting to silver.

My perspective shifts, not by brute force, but by gentle curiosity. Rather than recoiling from the darkness, I step into it, searching for forgotten jewels in the shadows. I speak to the shapes of doubt, weaving their edges with threads of possibility. Before me, a path unfolds—its flagstones glimmering with hope, inviting, each one inscribed with a secret: "There is always light, even in the deepest night."

I walk forward, able at last to see both the darkness and the dawn.
