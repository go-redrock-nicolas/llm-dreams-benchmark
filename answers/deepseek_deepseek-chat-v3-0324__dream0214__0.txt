I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and wild jasmine—a twilight haze settling over an endless library carved into the side of a living mountain. Shelves stretch into the gloom, their spines shimmering with gold-leaf titles in languages that shift when I blink. My footsteps echo, though the sound feels muffled, as if the walls themselves are breathing. Then, I see *them.*  

My mentor steps from the shadows, though they do not walk—they *flow,* like ink spilled into water. Their form is indistinct, a shifting silhouette that mirrors my best self back at me: the confidence I crave, the wisdom I reach for, the unshakable stillness I’ve fought to claim. Their voice is not a sound but a resonance in my bones.  

**"You already know the shape of the answer,"** they murmur. **"But you keep smoothing the edges to fit where it wasn’t meant to."**  

I want to protest, to list all the ways I’ve tried and failed, but they lift a hand—the gesture stopping my thoughts like a struck bell. Over their palm, a tiny galaxy spins, its stars rearranging into symbols: a quill, a locked door, a wilted flower. My struggles, given form.  

**"The doubt is not your enemy,"** they say, **"it’s the chisel. Let it carve you hollow so you can hold more light."**  

A wind rushes through the library, and suddenly, the books flutter open—pages reflecting memories I’d buried, choices I’d cursed, moments where I’d been *enough* and hadn’t noticed. The mentor’s edges blur, merging with the air like mist.  

**"Wake,"** they whisper, **"but don’t forget—**  
**you are both the sculptor and the stone."**  

And I gasp upright, fingertips tingling with the scent of jasmine still clinging to my skin.
