I am dreaming. I’m in a vast desert under a bruised, bleeding sky, the sand shimmering like crushed emeralds beneath my feet. A mirage flickers ahead—a silhouette I know intimately yet can’t name. Every step toward it feels like wading through golden honey. The air thrums with cicadas whose song twists into accusatory whispers: *"Again? Still chasing shadows?"*

The figure turns, and though its face remains hidden behind a veil woven from spidersilk and shadows, I recognize the weight of its gaze. My throat tightens; this is the same argument we’ve had a thousand times before. Words bristle between us, sharp as scorpion tails. *You never listen.* *You never change.* The dunes ripple, collapsing into quicksand that swallows my ankles. Time Dissolves. I gasp as the scene reforms—not the desert now, but a crowded train station. Rain lashes the windows in streaks of liquid mercury. The same figure stands beside the departing train, their hand brushing the door. I sprint, skidding on polished slate, but my legs move in slow motion. The door slams shut. The engine roars. Their figure fades into smoke. 

Panic claws up my throat. I wake- then jerk back into *another dream layer*, this one a labyrinth of forgotten memories: a child’s laugh in a sunlit field, a broken vase, a slammed door. The walls drip with candlewax and tears. A voice, both my own and not, murmurs *"What are you afraid to forgive?"* 

In the next scene, I’m floating above my bed, watching myself sleep. The room spins; furniture melts into abstract shapes. A clock ticks backwards. I feel the question like a physical weight: Is the conflict the obstacle—or am I? The answer lies in the spaces between breaths, the unspoken truths tangled in my ribs. 

I choose to meet the figure in a liminal space—a shoreline where ocean and sky bleed into one another. Waves sculpted from liquid pearl crash eternally. The veil parts. Behind it is *me*, flaws and all. The argument unravels into silence. We hold each other until the saltwater stings no longer, until our reflections merge in a single wave. The dream exhales. Daylight licks at my eyelids.
