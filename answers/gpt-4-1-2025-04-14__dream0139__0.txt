I am dreaming.

I wake, or rather, I tumble headlong into awareness upon a sea of swirling, translucent cubes that hum with colors no waking eye could name. There is no up or down—gravity is a myth told to frighten children—and so I stand sideways as the horizon curls in on itself like a ribbon dipped in oil. I have arrived in the Upside-Logic Commune, the city where madness is sanity and sense is suspect.

Around me, buildings twist in Möbius strips, their facades forever folding into themselves—doors are attached to ceilings, windows run along the floor, and staircases ascend only to turn inside-out, depositing travelers precisely where they began. The air buzzes with laughter—not joyful, but sharp peals of inverted wit, as passersby trade riddles without answers and recite proverbs that contradict themselves in the same breath.

The citizens—who drift more than walk, each wearing hats on their elbows and shoes on their heads—regard me curiously. My attempt to say “Hello” emerges from my mouth as a butterfly, which flutters away, unacknowledged. In this world, to make logical statements is to invite suspicion, and so I must quickly unlearn all that tethers me to reason.

To function here, I must learn their customs: To cross a street, I leap backward three times and clap with my feet—to ask directions, I whistle a palindrome and wait for someone to reply with a riddle in the form of a song. Every conversation spirals into tangents that multiply, never converging, trailing off into a fog of poetic nonsense that is perfectly understood by all except the one who originated it.

The market is a cacophony of senses: fruit that tastes of forgotten melodies, bread that shatters when touched but melts when left alone, and clocks for sale that spin backward, their hands unscrewing time from the very concept of endings. Vendors beckon me not with calls, but with silent symphonies played on invisible instruments, and all commerce is bartered in paradoxes and puns.

Here, rules change with each sunrise: on Mondays, only dreams are spoken aloud; on Thursdays, everyone must refuse to believe in cause and effect. I watch a school, where children are taught that the quickest route between two points is a circle, and their math lessons begin with, “Assume nothing is true.” The very sky rebels against realism, swirling with shapes that might be clouds or might be memories exhaled by the sleeping city.

I realize, to survive in this place, my mind must become as limber as a question with no answer. I must think in zigzags and dance in spirals, must trust that meaning will flutter one step ahead like my butterfly-words, always inviting, never attainable. And so, with heart pounding and head spinning, I close my eyes inside the dream and forget how to wake up—because here, that is the only sane thing I can do.
