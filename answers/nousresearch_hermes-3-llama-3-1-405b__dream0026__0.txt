I am dreaming. In this dream, I am somewhere really interesting.

I find myself stood on a stage in the middle of a grand coliseum built of large, ancient stones intricately engraved with symbols of a lost world. As far as my eyes can see, the stands are filled with silhouettes of a cheering, faceless audience, their energetic roars reverberating off the curved walls. At one end of the oval arena, a panel of three eminent judges is seated under an ornately decorated marquee, scrutinizing my every move as they hold my fate in their hands.

Today, I am here to perform a skill I have practiced and perfected over a countless number of years - a mesmerizing display of control over the four elements - a combination of air, water, fire, and earth seamlessly intermingling in a breathtaking spectacle.

As I begin, I close my eyes and take a deep, calming breath, feeling the cool air filling my lungs. My heart races with anticipation, and a bead of sweat trickles down my forehead. I take a step forward, planting my feet firmly on the ground, feeling the earth's energy surging through me.

With a graceful flourish of my arms, I summon the air around me, whipping it up into a powerful vortex that encircles the entire stage. Leaves and petals dance around me, suspended in the maelstrom, as I focus my will on the element of water.

I plunge my left hand into the vortex, pulling forth tendrils of shimmering water from the air. As they sway and swirl around me, I sculpt the water into a beautiful, shimmering orb that levitates above my right hand - the birth of a miniature, self-contained universe.

Next, I turn my focus to the element of fire. With a snap of my fingers, the torches surrounding the stage ignite, the flames dancing in the swirling winds. Extending my hand toward the nearest flame, I pull it toward me, weaving it into the vortex, melding it with the dancing waters.

Finally, with the elements of air, water, and fire under my control, I craft intricate patterns in the air, mixing and merging the three into a single, harmonious symphony of raw elements. The judges and audience alike watch in awe as I whirl and twist the forces around me before finally, with an agile flourish, I incorporate the final element â€“ earth.

I slam my foot on the ground, stones breaking away and joining the vortex as they liquefy and solidify, moving in harmony with the liquid fire in the air. As the dance reaches its climax, the elements coalesce, creating a brilliant, pulsating core of elemental energy above my head.

With a swift, decisive movement, I send the orb crashing down to the ground, instantly transforming into a breathtaking crystal tree, its shimmering branches reaching upward, as if yearning to return to the sky from which they came. A wave of deafening applause washes over me, blowing through my hair and tugging at my clothes.

I take one last bow and wake up from the dream of a lifetime.
