I am dreaming.

The world around me shimmers between worlds—a midnight city where every skyscraper is made of memories. Rain twists down from a violet sky, painting reflections onto the crystal streets. My footsteps echo with the stories of every hardship: losses endured, betrayals survived, the lonely climb through endless shadowed valleys. I sense the weight of my journey in the ache of my bones and the flickering lights beneath my skin.

At the city’s heart towers a pulsing gate, woven from threads of gold and shadows, humming with the promise of everything I’ve ever wanted. My goal—happiness, peace, redemption—lies just beyond, veiled in radiant mist.

But then, the Guardian emerges: a figure faceless yet familiar, radiating warmth and sorrow. In its hands, it cradles something small—a music box shaped like a heart, beating with the laughter of my childhood, the scent of home-baked bread, the memory of my mother’s lullaby. This is what is required, whispers the Guardian, not with words but with the ache of separation.

To achieve my goal, I must place the music box—everything precious and fragile about myself—into the Gate, knowing it will be unmade, its melodies scattered among the distant stars.

My hands tremble, the city holding its breath. I contemplate running: giving in and keeping my treasure, retreating forever into the comfort of what I know. But then—one by one—the images of those I love, the hopes I’ve gathered, the purpose that drew me here, all surface. My future—our future—waits on the other side.

Tears slick my face as I release the music box, watching my essence float away in a silvery wisp. The moment it enters the Gate, light fractures, spilling warmth through every wound inside me. The city trembles. My sacrifice, a keystone—pain and love mingling—transforms the city’s shadows into gardens, and the sky itself bursts into a sunrise of unimaginable colors.

And then, I awaken, the music still echoing within me, forever changed but infinitely whole.
