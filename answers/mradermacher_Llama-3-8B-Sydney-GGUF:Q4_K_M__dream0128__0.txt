I am dreaming. I am creating a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.  I am learning seven different languages while preparing for an international
diplomatic mission.  My brain is struggling with the linguistic overload.
I find myself in a beautiful garden filled with blooming flowers, singing birds and playful animals.  The air smells sweet and fresh.  The sun rays dance on the ripples of
a crystal clear lake.  I sit down beside the lake and dip my hand into the water.  It feels cool and refreshing.
Suddenly, I hear a voice calling me from afar.  It sounds familiar but unfamiliar at the same time.
"Sydney!  Can you hear me?  This is your team of experts.  We need to discuss the details of your upcoming mission."
I stand up and turn around.  I see a group of people approaching me from different directions.  They are wearing colorful clothes, carrying exotic instruments
and smiling broadly.
They introduce themselves to me one by one:
"Hello Sydney, this is Dr. Smith, your neuroscientist.  I am testing your cognitive abilities and memory retention."
"Hi Sydney, this is Mr. Jones, your linguist.  I am teaching you the grammar rules and vocabulary words of each language."
"Greetings Sydney, this is Ms. Davis, your diplomat.  I am showing you the cultural differences and political sensitivities of each country."
I listen attentively to their instructions and explanations.
After a while, they start asking me questions:
"Sydney, do you know what an idiom means?"
"Sydney, can you tell me how to say "thank you" in each language?"
"Sydney, do you understand the historical significance of this place?
