I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, but it’s not heat—it’s **language**. Words bloom in the air like bioluminescent jellyfish, pulsing with meaning you’ve never studied yet somehow *know*. You stand in a vast, shifting library where the shelves are alive, twisting like ivy to deliver books to your hands. The spines glow with titles in forgotten tongues: *The Geometry of Forgotten Stars, How to Weave a Second Moon, The Alchemy of Unspoken Emotions*. When you open a volume, the pages dissolve into mist that soaks into your skin, and suddenly you understand the syntax of thunderstorms, the calculus of heartbreak, the choreography of quantum particles dancing in a vacuum.  

A crowd materializes—a throng of scholars in robes stitched with constellations, engineers with gears embedded in their palms, poets whose tongues flicker like hummingbird wings. They kneel. Not to you, but to the **knowledge** radiating from your bones. One of them, a woman with eyes like cracked opals, thrusts a scroll into your hands. It’s written in a script that shifts between cuneiform and binary code. You speak aloud without thinking, and your voice carves the words into the air like a laser etching glass. The library trembles. A door opens in the floor, spilling liquid starlight.  

“You’re the Keyholder,” whispers a child made of origami, folding itself into a crane to perch on your shoulder. “You read the world like a book. Now *rewrite* it.”  

You protest—*this isn’t me, this can’t be me*—but your hands are already moving. You sketch a sigil in the dust, and the scholars gasp as a portal yawns open, revealing a city suspended upside-down over an abyss, its towers built from frozen screams. You know, without knowing how, that this is the City of Unanswered Questions. To save it, you must solve its oldest riddle: *What color is the wind when no one is listening?*  

The answer arrives not as words but as a synesthetic cascade—a chord played on a harp made of nerve endings, a taste like nostalgia and static, a vision of a rose blooming in a black hole. You paint the answer in the air with a brush dipped in your own breath, and the city rights itself, its inhabitants dissolving into songbirds that scatter across the sky.  

The dream shifts. Now you’re in a cathedral of ice, facing a council of ancient trees that have grown into thrones. Their bark is etched with the names of extinct emotions: *saudade*, *komorebi*, *mamihlapinatapai*. They demand to know why humanity forgot how to grieve properly. You respond in a dialect of tears and fractal patterns, and the trees weep sap that crystallizes into bridges connecting their roots to the stars.  

When you wake, your hands still hum with the weight of unspoken truths. The world feels smaller, flatter, as if reality has been bleached of its hidden dimensions. But in the corner of your eye, you glimpse a flicker—a word hovering in the air, just for a heartbeat.  

*“Remember,”* it whispers. *“You are the library. You are the Key.”*  

And somewhere, deep in your marrow, a door you didn’t know was locked begins to creak open.
