I am dreaming. In this dream, the night sky stretches above you in billowing turquoise clouds that shimmer like liquid pearls. The air carries an otherworldly hum, somewhere between music and wind, and it wraps around you like a comforting lullaby. You stand on a beach that’s impossibly soft, the sands colored a pale lavender beneath your feet. Strange glowing fish leap in and out of the waves, casting small sparks up into the star-speckled sky.

Everything feels simultaneously serene and unnerving, a dreamland balance of enchantment and deep unease. And there, standing at the water’s edge, is your close friend. They stare into the distance, arms crossed protectively over their chest, their posture strangely rigid—so different from the lighthearted companion you’ve known for years.

At first, you hesitate, noticing how their entire aura seems… warped, as if someone has dimmed their natural light. They turn toward you, and though their expression is neutral, their eyes flicker with some unspoken worry. You suddenly recall moments in your waking life when they seemed withdrawn or distracted, brushing off your questions with forced smiles.

You take a deep breath of the warm, shimmering air and step closer. The closer you move, the more you sense an invisible boundary, like stepping through a thick haze or wading through invisible water. It’s as if something keeps you from getting too close—like they’re radiating a subtle barrier of fear and disconnection. Yet you press on, determined to uncover the root of this surreal shift.

In a soft, echoing voice (the kind that only exists in dreams), you call out your friend’s name. They turn abruptly. In that moment, the turquoise sky above intensifies, cracks of rose-colored lightning zipping across the clouds. The dream’s luminous fish leap higher, popping into tiny sparks that float around your friend as if revealing shadowy pieces of their psyche.

They open their mouth to speak, but no words come out—only a sigh that seems laced with sorrow. You swallow, gathering your courage, and ask gently, “Are you okay?” Although you receive no verbal response, your friend’s eyes—now glimmering with tears—tell you that something is terribly wrong.

A sudden gust rises, swirling the lavender sand skyward and forming a haze around the two of you. Your friend’s figure flickers, as though they’re an image projected onto shifting curtains of mist. You reach out, placing your hand on their shoulder. You speak again, carefully and with deep compassion, expressing your worry and letting them know that you’re there to help. The dreamscape grows quiet, as if listening to your promise.

All around you, the glowing sparks from the fish now cluster into a halo of light, swirling gently around your friend’s trembling figure. With your reassurance, the barrier you sensed starts to fade. You catch a glimpse of their eyes—heavy with all the burdens they’ve been carrying in silence. It’s clear that they’re hurting, yet also clear that they’re relieved to see you notice.

The kingdom of your dream adjusts around this change in energy: The turquoise clouds overhead unravel into rippling sheets of gold, and the rose lightning becomes harmless, chromatic ribbons that dance away in the sky. The fish leap in celebration, and their bright sparks settle peacefully at your feet. Slowly, you lead your friend off the edge of the water, guiding them to a spot where the swirling sands calm. You feel a warmth in your chest, an outpouring of empathy, as you remind them that you’re there to listen without judgment or rush.

They turn to you at last, still wordless, but the gentle nod they give holds a promise of eventual confession—a sign that, when this dream ends and the veil of real life returns, you’ll find a way to connect with them. Perhaps it starts with a quiet conversation over coffee, or a walk through a familiar park where they can finally let their guard down. The important thing is that they know, even in the depths of this dream, that someone sees their struggle and wants to help.

As the dream haze begins to lift and the scene dissolves into twilight, you catch one final glimpse of their eyes—now softer, searching, ready to share. Your heart surges with hope and a sense of calm determination. And with that, the dream passes, leaving you with a promise to reach out in waking life, to embrace both words and silences, to encourage your friend to step out of the shadows and come into the warm, healing light of understanding.
