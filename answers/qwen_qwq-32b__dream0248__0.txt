I am dreaming. I see a figure, small and trembling, standing at the edge of a vast, silver-lake. They clutch a glowing blue stone, tears falling into the water’s surface, rippling the reflections of swirling galaxies above. The figure’s sorrow is tangible, a hum in the air, but I feel... nothing. Not grief, not concern—just a hollow detachment. My chest is a sealed vault, observations flowing instead of emotions: *The stone’s luminescence dims with their sobs*.  *Their breath mists in air that shouldn’t be cold here*.  My hands move automatically to pick up a shattered mirror at my feet. Its fragments show not my face but scenes—ayers cliffsPaint.jpg, a wolf howling at a blood moon, a child’s laughter crystallizing into snowflakes. The figure turns, mouth open to scream, but no sound comes. I step closer. The lake’s surface cracks like glass, black tendrils snaking upward. They stumble back, the stone now smoldering. I reach out, compelled by logic not compassion. *If the stone fractures, will the tears stop?* My fingertips brush the heat of it—the stone’s light explodes inward, swallowing the figure in a silent eclipse. The mirror in my hands shatters entirely. And in the shards, for the first time, I see tears.
