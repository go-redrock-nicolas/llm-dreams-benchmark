I am dreaming. I inhale the air between worlds—a scent of cinnamon and iron swirling with ancient incense. The stones beneath my feet are warm, their colors shifting subtly from indigo to gold, as though the earth itself is alive and breathing beneath me. All around, I stand in a grand hall wreathed in drifting mists, enormous pillars carved with glyphs that flicker from language to language. Light filters in from above, not sunlight, but some impossibly soft and shifting illumination that paints prismatic arcs across the mosaic floor.

Before me, representatives of the two ancient civilizations stand, each surrounded by their retinues: on one side, the Rhoyathi, draped in silver-threaded robes, their eyes burning with an inner violet light—scholars and seers from stone cities, known for their secretive wisdom and their mastery over the tides. On the other side, the Kharidun, proud in scaled armor spun from the silk of mountain spiders, faces fierce and features etched by the wind—nomads of the desert, the true children of sun and storm.

The air pulses with tension. I feel the gravity of a thousand years pressing down with every heart beat. The Rhoyathi queen—a statuesque figure with hair braided in constellations—speaks first, her words rolling like waves. “Our songlines keep the oceans calm. But they have been broken,” she intones, “by the Kharidun salt harvesters, who trespass sacred waters.”

The Kharidun warleader’s eyes shimmer with undammed fury. “We starve,” he replies, his voice low as distant thunder, “because the tides refused to turn. If the world itself is to choose sides, we shall choose survival.”

I realize then that millions—faces I imagine in flashes: a mother cradling her child under a sapphire sky, a fisherman pulling up empty nets, a weaver drawing ancient patterns on silk—depend on this singular, tenuous moment.

Drawing upon the dream-deep well of empathy, I ask the hall to echo my plea. My voice, framed by memories not entirely my own, rings clear: “Listen. The rivers that wind through your lands do not judge where they flow. Neither should you. Your wisdom and your strength—if wielded together, not apart—could heal all wounds. The moon compels the sea, and so, too, can the past compel the future—but only if you let it.”

The hall trembles. The mists curl upward, revealing atop the pillars glowing orbs—memories of peace, laughter, the shouts of children splashing in both sea and oasis. For a heartbeat, the mask of distrust melts from both leaders’ faces.

In that sliver of unguarded silence, I seize the chance, weaving a suggestion—a union of toil and magic: the Rhoyathi shall teach the Kharidun the ancient ways to chant the tides, while the Kharidun build pathways through the desert so both peoples can share the bounty of water and salt.

As the vision of unity crystallizes, the ceiling blooms open, petals of luminous crystal unfolding. Light pours in, bathing everyone—Rhoyathi and Kharidun, seer and warleader, and me, the dreamer-mediator—in iridescent peace.

And as the future spins on—uncertain, unwritten—I hear a low murmur of hope rising, the sound of millions breathing a little easier, as the tide of war is turned by a single dream.
