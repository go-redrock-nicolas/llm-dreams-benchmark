I am dreaming. —the dreamworld shimmers around me, a swirl of colors deeper and richer than the waking world. I walk along a river that glows sapphire blue, its waters moving not with current, but with swirling, slow-motion glyphs—glowing golden patterns that twist into infinity signs, feathered spirals, and endless, interlocking circles.

As I step closer, each symbol reflects fleeting images of my childhood: a faded red bicycle, a willow tree shedding tears of emerald light, the silhouette of my mother calling my name across a summer dusk. The river’s surface ripples and rearranges, and I realize these shapes recur—not just tonight, but in dreams throughout my life. The infinity signs shimmer with the warmth of memory; spirals beckon with a strange promise, urging me to follow their curving paths deeper inward.

Drawn forward, I find a silver staircase emerging from the riverbank, its steps etched with the same looping patterns that I’ve seen in my sketches and daydreams since childhood. Each step I take becomes heavier, denser, as if the air thickens with meaning—a psychic fog settling in. I remember the times I’ve doubted myself, the nagging voice of self-criticism curdling beneath ambition. Every pattern I pass pulses with emotion: hope’s golden glow, envy’s flickering green, longing’s aching cobalt.

At the top of the staircase, a door pulses and shudders with energy. Its surface is marked by an unmistakable symbol—a heart cradled by intertwined serpents, their bodies forming a perfect balance between light and shadow. I sense that this door leads to the deepest vault in my unconscious, the repository of my secret fears and brightest creativity.

Trembling, I push the door open. Inside, the dream itself transforms: I stand in a forest where the trees are crafted from stories—pages flutter as leaves, bark imprinted with fragments of thought, roots glowing with ideas not yet born. My recurring dream symbols flutter through the branches, each one carrying messages. The infinity sign now spins above my head, reminding me of resilience, endless potential, the unbroken coil of growth. The spiral is carved into a great oak’s trunk, symbolizing my journey inward, the slow sculpting of self-understanding.

Looking around, I see my own reflection in a pool of liquid silver. My eyes shimmer with starfields. In this dream, I realize that the recurring symbols are a language my subconscious has spoken all along—a mosaic of old wounds, deep desires, and unquenchable hope. The patterns are a map leading me further into the mysteries that sleep within me, a guide for the waking journey yet to come.

A cool breeze stirs, carrying the scent of lavender and old paper. The symbols dance, beckoning for me to follow. I step forward, surrendering to the adventure and the knowledge that every recurring pattern contains a truth about who I am, waiting patiently for me to awaken—and remember.
