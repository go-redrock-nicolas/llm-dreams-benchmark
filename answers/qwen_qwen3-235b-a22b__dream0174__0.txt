I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers with a silvery haze, as though the world is woven from moonlight and whispered secrets. You walk through a valley where the ground pulses faintly beneath your feet, like the slow, steady breath of a sleeping giant. The sky above is a tapestry of liquid stars, constellations shifting and reforming into shapes that mirror the thoughts you’ve buried deep—fears, regrets, the weight of unspoken truths. Then, through a veil of mist, the community appears.  

They are not waiting for you, but they *know* you. Their eyes hold the quiet wisdom of those who have walked through fire and carried their scars like lanterns. The village is built from materials that defy logic: walls of woven starlight, roofs that drip with liquid amber, doors that open into rooms of memory and healing. A child runs past you, clutching a butterfly made of smoke, and it grins at you with your own face.  

They gather around—not to judge, but to *see*. An elder with hair like a waterfall speaks first, her voice the sound of wind through autumn leaves. “You carry a storm inside,” she says, and the words are not a question. Others nod, their own storms hinted at in the shadows that flicker around them—chains of glass, oceans trapped in teardrops, clocks with broken hands. They do not offer platitudes. Instead, they show you their wounds, raw and glowing, and in their vulnerability, you feel the first crack in your own armor.  

When they invite you to join, it is not with words but a gesture: a hand extended, palm up, cradling a single ember that flickers with the color of your deepest ache. To take it is to accept that you are not alone, that your pain is not a solitary prison but a thread in a vast, luminous tapestry. You clasp their hand, and the ember blooms into a flame that does not burn—it *cleanses*.  

The ritual begins. You walk with them to a lake of liquid obsidian, its surface rippling with reflections of your past struggles. They ask you to speak, and when you do, your voice trembles but does not break. As you name your burden, they kneel and press their foreheads to the ground, not in pity, but in solidarity. Then, together, they lift you—not physically, but with a force that hums in your bones, a chorus of silent will and warmth. You float above the lake, and your shadow, once a twisted thing, unravels like thread, dissolving into a thousand fireflies that scatter across the sky.  

When you return to the earth, the elder presses a seed into your palm, warm as a heartbeat. “Plant this when you wake,” she says. “Water it with what you’ve carried. It will grow into a bridge.”  

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue and the unshakable sense that somewhere, in the liminal space between sleep and waking, a community still hums with the song of your name—a song that is no longer a dirge, but a lullaby for the part of you that finally feels safe enough to rest.
