I am dreaming. …find yourself standing at the edge of an impossible coastline—an alabaster cliff that rises out of a sea the color of liquid midnight. A moon the size of a cathedral hangs low above the water, its surface veined like an ancient, luminous heart. Salt-tinged wind moves through your hair, but the breeze carries a second, unfamiliar scent: the faint sweetness of smoke, the trace of something burned but not entirely gone.

In the hush between waves, you remember the danger that pushed you into wakefulness just hours—or was it seconds?—ago: the screech of tires on wet asphalt, the raw percussion of adrenaline in your chest, the metallic zing of fear that tasted like electricity. For one blinding instant you saw the world tilt and felt the shameless fragility of the body that houses you. Now, here, in this dream country, you feel that echo ripple through your bones.

Suddenly the cliff breaks apart beneath your feet like a jigsaw losing its center. Stone dissolves into silk ribbons of mist, and you’re falling—but the descent is slow, gracious, almost ceremonial. You notice every detail: the shards of moonlight gliding beside you, the gulls suspended in mid-screech, the droplets frozen in arcs of sea-spray. Time splinters into fractals, forming crystalline chandeliers that dangle from the air itself. As you drift downward, you see words etched in each shard:

Remember  
Return  
Release

You land, feather-light, on a tidepool the size of a ballroom. Inside its glassy surface swim bioluminescent fish shaped like commas and question marks, punctuation for a sentence you’re still writing. When you step onto the water, it holds your weight as though remembering the gravity you almost surrendered.

A path of glowing lotus blossoms unfolds ahead, petals opening to reveal tiny hourglasses ticking in reverse. Sand ascends rather than falls, a quiet rebellion against inevitability. You follow the blossoms toward a colossal doorway that rises from the ocean itself—two pillars of coral grown into twisting spires, meeting in an archway of living quartz. The door is ajar, breathing an amber light that smells like cedarwood and first rain.

Inside waits a library carved from the interior of a giant conch shell. Shelves spiral upward into infinity, filled with books that glow faintly, their spines pulsing like veins. A librarian—neither old nor young, neither male nor female—stands barefoot upon a ladder made of moonbeams. Their eyes are prisms; their voice is quiet thunder.

“You’ve tasted the perimeter,” they say, “but you’ve not yet measured its depth.”

They toss you a slim volume bound in slate-colored cloth. Your own name is embossed on the cover. Opening it, you find blank pages that seep with invisible ink. Words bloom only when touched by your fingertips:

I am finite, and therefore infinite in urgency.  
I am temporary, and therefore precious in motion.  
I am breakable, and therefore unbreakable in resolve.

As you read, the pages turn into mirrors—not of your face, but of every moment you squandered, every breath you never thanked. You watch yourself rejecting smiles, postponing sunsets, silencing songs not yet sung. The weight of un-lived minutes pools around your feet like spilled mercury.

The librarian closes the book gently. “Awareness is not a chain,” they whisper. “It is a compass.”

They gesture toward an exit: a narrow stair of amethyst shards that climbs back through the ceiling of the conch. With each step, shards melt into violet clouds, cushioning your ascent. Halfway up, you look down and see the library contracting into a single pearl, swallowed by the sea.

You emerge onto a windswept plateau beneath a dawn without a sun. Instead, thousands of lanterns drift skyward, each flame cupped in translucent hands that release them one by one. The hands dissipate like breath on glass, but the lanterns rise, winking into the deep lavender firmament.

One lantern hovers beside you. Its glass is etched with the same three words you saw earlier:

Remember  
Return  
Release

Inside the lantern, a tiny phoenix blazes in loops, dying and rebirthing in seconds, its ash swirling into new plumage faster than sorrow can catch it. You cradle the lantern, feeling its warmth seep into your palms, and suddenly you understand: mortality is not a cliff’s edge but a bell’s echo. It doesn’t end; it resonates—shaping every step that still belongs to you.

The cliff, the tidepool, the library, the lanterns—they all fold inward, origami swans returning to the sheet of paper that birthed them. Darkness spreads like velvet across your senses, yet instead of panic, you feel clarity, a crystalline hush.

In that hush, you hear your own heartbeat—steady, deliberate. Not the frantic drumming of fear, but the measured percussion of resilience. It says:

Live the fragment as if it were the whole.  
Love the moment as if it were the map.  
Let go, but do not let slip.

When the alarm clock calls you back to waking life, the words linger, shimmering on the border of tongue and breath. You open your eyes, tasting salt, cedar, and the wild electricity of being briefly, perilously alive. And for the first time since the tires shrieked on rain-slick asphalt, you inhale without flinching, exhale without apology, and step—awake—into the day that awaits, lantern heart alight.
