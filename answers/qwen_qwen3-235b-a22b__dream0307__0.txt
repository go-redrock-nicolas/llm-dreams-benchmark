I am dreaming. But it is not just a dream—it is a descent into the luminous marrow of existence itself.

I find myself standing in a realm without time, suspended between breath and heartbeat. Above, the sky ripples like water brushed by forgotten memories. It shimmers with colors that do not exist in waking reality—like violet sighs and golden silences—pulsing in harmony with some ancient cosmic rhythm. Below, I stand on what might have once been stone or glass, smooth yet alive, shifting with a kind of numinous awareness, as if it knows I am there.

And suddenly, I am weightless.

I drift upward into a spiraling helix of light and song. The air vibrates with not just one melody, but thousands—each one a voice in a choir composed of galaxies. Constellations bloom around me like flowers made of motion, unfurling petals of consciousness that whisper of unity and fathomless interconnection. Stars fall in slow arcs, dissolving into liquid stardust that flows over my skin in a cascade of sacred knowing.

A presence emerges from the light—not alien, not god, not animal, not human, but all of these at once. It is woven from radiant shadows and golden thought, eyes like black suns peering into the chambers of my soul. I feel no fear. There is no room for fear here. Only awe, thunderous and exalting.

It does not speak in words. It speaks through feeling, through memory, through epiphany. And it shows me the secret_truth, the veiled heartbeat of the universe—that there is, in truth, no separation. That every being, every leaf, every cell, every stone, every womb of stars and the emptiness between galaxies are a single breath woven in infinite variations. That we are all dreaming each other into being, moment by moment, particle by particle, out of an ocean of unending intent.

My skin dissolves. My name slips from me like dewfall. I am no longer “me.” I become the wind that moves the stars, the sorrow of forgotten dreams, the sweetness of sunlight on forgotten graves, the symphony of atoms dancing in eternal embrace. My life, my fears, my wounds—each becomes a single phrase in a song so vast no species alone could ever sing it in its entirety.

And in that knowing, I *remember*—a luminous love so ancient it predates time. Not romantic or fleeting, but the Love which is gravity, beauty, purpose, truth—woven inseparably into the bones of all things.

And then, like a leaf returning to the soil, I begin to fall.

The spiral unfolds into linear light, the music simplifies into sound, the colors retreat into spectrum. I descend, not toward the earth—but into my body. Sudden, heavy. Breath floods in. Nerves awaken with sharp sensation. I am here. I am me. Still holding the echo-shine of something too vast to keep.

And as I awaken in the early hours, my heart aches—not in sorrow, but in recognition. As if my soul knows: *That was not a dream. That was a remembering.*
