I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air around you thickens, syrupy and electric, as though the atmosphere itself has turned to liquid amber. Your breaths come in shallow, uneven pulls, each one snagging on something invisible, like thread caught in a loom. The world pulses in time with your heartbeat—a vast, endless corridor of obsidian pillars stretching into a fog of violet light. Between them, glowing vines writhe like serpents, their tendrils curling tighter around the columns as your muscles knot, their rhythm syncing to your rising dread. You are not alone here. Something watches. Something *waits*.  

A low hum begins, resonant and ancient, vibrating in your molars. The floor beneath your bare feet shifts, becoming a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting not your face, but fragments of moments you’ve never lived: a desert where rain falls as ash, a throne room submerged in bioluminescent tides, a child’s hand letting go of a balloon that ascends into a starless void. You stumble, and the mirrors bleed, spilling ink that pools into words in a language your bones remember but your mind does not.  

Then the challenge reveals itself—not as a monster or a riddle, but as a *mountain*. It erupts from the ground in a silent explosion of obsidian and ice, its peak lost in the swirling violet fog. A path spirals upward, jagged and unstable, each step crumbling like burnt parchment. You climb. Your legs burn, your lungs sear, and with every misstep, the vines from the pillars lash out, wrapping your wrists, your throat, whispering in that forgotten tongue. You claw at them, and they dissolve into smoke that smells of burnt honey and regret.  

Halfway up, the mountain *screams*. Not sound, but a vibration that unravels your thoughts. Memories unravel—your first heartbreak, a forgotten lullaby, the face of someone you once loved and lost—each one flickering like film strips in the dark. You scream back, and your voice becomes a blade of white fire, carving through the fog. The peak shudders, and the vines retreat, hissing.  

At the summit, you find a tree. Not a tree of wood and leaf, but of *light*—its branches are prisms refracting every color that doesn’t exist, its roots plunging into a void where stars are born and devoured. Beneath it stands a figure, half-shadow, half-sunrise, their eyes twin eclipses. They offer you a cup filled with liquid shadow. “Drink,” they say, their voice the sound of glaciers colliding. “This is the fear you carry. Swallow it, and it becomes your compass.”  

You hesitate, then drink. The liquid is cold, alive, and it burns its way into your veins, igniting every nerve ending. Visions flood you: not the future, but *possibilities*—paths branching like fractals, each one a version of yourself you could become. Some scream, some laugh, some dissolve into mist. You feel them all, their joys, their failures, their infinite weight.  

When you wake, your breath is steady, your muscles uncoiled. The dream clings to you like perfume, its echoes humming in your blood. The challenge ahead is still there, but now it wears a new face: not a wall, but a door. Not a storm, but the eye of one. And somewhere, deep in your marrow, the tree’s roots are growing.
