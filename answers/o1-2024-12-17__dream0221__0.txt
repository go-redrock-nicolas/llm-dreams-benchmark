I am dreaming. …step onto a stage nestled within an opulent, otherworldly theater. Velvety curtains the color of midnight rise and reveal an endless amphitheater shaped like a blooming rose, every petal a towering tier filled with onlookers in shimmering attire. The spotlight warms the top of your head like a halo, and your breath feels electric with anticipation. 

Before this dream started, you never took a single lesson in this art—let’s call it “Celestial Silk Choreography,” a dance form using streams of weightless fabric that float and coil around the performer like living tendrils. It’s rumored to be so challenging that even grandmasters train decades to attempt its basic maneuvers. Yet, here you stand, heart pounding, instincts vibrating with an inexplicable sense of mastery.

The music begins with a low, resonant hum, softly building into a crescendo of chiming strings and distant drumbeats. In response, you stretch out your arms, and instantly the silken scarves unfurl from your fingertips, glimmering with starlight. The crowd gasps—it’s as though galaxies spiral out from your hands, forming fluid arcs of dusty light. You sway and twirl, letting the illusions of drifting cosmos dance around your body. The space between you and gravity melts away, and you glide across the stage as if on hidden currents of air.

With a sudden leap, you fling yourself high into the open space above. The silken ribbons cling to your limbs, then unfurl in slow motion, suspending you in midair. Time seems to liquefy. A hush falls over the audience. The scarves spiral around your torso, winding into elaborate patterns that speak of ancient constellations. Without fear or hesitation, you release your grip, letting the shimmering fabric whip outward in a whorl of stardust. You spin gracefully, suspended like a nebula, with the majestic audience below looking on in awe.

In a stunning finale, the music’s final chord echoes through the amphitheater, and the silk harnesses guide you downward with the gentleness of a drifting feather. The scarves slip away, evaporating into tiny, dancing motes of light that cascade over the stage like glowing petals. Everyone is silent for an impossibly long moment as you stand bathed in starlight. Then the cheers begin—an eruption of sound so powerful it shakes the airy petals of the amphitheater. You can feel the thunder of applause deep in your bones.

You bow, breath catching in your throat, heart bursting with exhilaration and disbelief. There is a sense of euphoria, as though you have conjured the magic from the very core of your being. No explanation is necessary; in the world of dreams, your sudden mastery is as natural as breathing. As the curtains close around you, you still hear the echo of clapping hands and the lilting whisper of silk dissolving into the darkness, leaving you with a trembling sense of possibility. Then you awaken, your mind ablaze with wonder, and a single question throbs in your thoughts: did you really discover such brilliance in your sleep—or did you always carry it within you?
