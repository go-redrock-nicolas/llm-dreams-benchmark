I am dreaming. Your heart races as you awaken to a strange, unfamiliar world—a world where your occupation, the very identity that has defined you, no longer exists. The air is thick with an odd, humid warmth, and the sounds of unearthly birdsong fill the air. You're standing in the middle of a sprawling, vividly green landscape, but everything seems off-kilter—the trees lean in ways that defy physics, and flowers bloom in pulsating, neon colors that seem to follow your gaze.

As you survey your surroundings, you notice other figures emerging from the earth, disoriented and scared, like you. Each of them bows to a different lyre; a blacksmith sets up an immense anvil in the middle of a field, a priest stands with his hands outstretched, murmuring prayers, and a chef begins preparing an elaborate meal, though there is no dining table in sight. It becomes clear that this world has its own ethos, a strange rhythm that demands adaptation and resourcefulness.

Unable to escape, you begin to embrace this new reality. You carve your own path, using the skills you’ve acquired in your old life to navigate this alien terrain. Peering around, you feel the ground beneath you shift and begin to plant seeds of change, determined to create something out of this strange and foreboding new reality.
