I am dreaming.

I find myself drifting through a city that glows with a soft, silvery luminescence—a radiance that isn’t light exactly, but something closer to the pulse of shared emotion. The air shivers with soothing warmth, holding the perfume of a thousand alien blossoms, each breath drawing in a peace so profound it seems to soothe even my deepest memories of pain.

In this society, smiling faces glide past on floating walkways, their eyes wide open, utterly free from worry. Children laugh in slow motion, unbruised by fear or want. Everywhere, screens shimmer with images of harmony: communities sharing meals, hands healed the instant they are scraped, laughter echoing instead of cries. There is balance, yes, and joy—yet a peculiar stillness hums beneath it, as if the world itself exhales and never quite inhales again.

I am led to a temple of glass and living trees, where the leaders, serene and ethereal, await. They speak with voices like water—impossibly gentle, rippling through my mind without words. They describe how they ended all suffering: every doubt and grief is plucked from their citizens’ minds at birth, dissolved and replaced with perfect contentment.

But this is no ordinary cure. The society’s secret is woven into the way they touch thoughts, tuning each mind to unity, smoothing out every jagged edge, silencing memories and impulses that cause unrest. Difference dims. The individual dissolves into the collective—a murmuration of consciousness where no single heart aches, but no single hope burns, either.

My own values struggle and flicker in the quiet. I want to celebrate this canceling of pain. But I see too the cost: memory softens, ambition erodes, art turns pale, devotion recedes. The wild, irrepressible dreaming of a single soul is stilled in favor of peaceful sameness. There is no suffering, but also no restlessness, no rebellion, no aching beauty born from unmet longing.

As I linger at the border of their calm, they invite me to join, promising an end to turmoil and an embrace of enduring harmony. I feel their promise tickling at the corners of my mind. Yet within me, the embers of my own suffering, my sharpest joys and most desperate tears, urge me to remember what it is to be wholly, painfully alive.

I hesitate, awash in wonder and dread, poised on the threshold—torn between the irresistible peace they offer and the fierce, ragged freedom of being fully, fallibly myself.

The dream shivers, and I realize: here, in this moment of indecision, I am more awake than ever.
