I am dreaming. I find myself in a bustling city square, where the late afternoon sun casts long shadows between gleaming skyscrapers. The air suddenly grows thick with an otherworldly green mist that rolls in like liquid silk, causing the crowds around me to gasp and point upward. As panic begins to ripple through the masses, I feel a peculiar tingling sensation coursing through my body, starting from my fingertips.

To my astonishment, I realize I can manipulate time itself. The world around me begins to move in slow motion – a coffee cup tumbling from someone's hand hangs suspended in mid-air, its contents forming beautiful amber droplets that glisten like jewels. I watch in fascination as a flock of pigeons, frozen mid-flight, creates a living sculpture against the eerily green sky.

With this newfound ability, I move through the suspended chaos like a ghost, gently guiding terrified people away from falling debris and potential danger. Each person I touch briefly flickers back to normal speed, just long enough to direct them to safety, before returning to their slow-motion state. The experience feels like conducting an elaborate ballet of survival.

The green mist continues to thicken, and now it seems to be forming impossible shapes – floating geometric patterns that defy physics and spiral through the air like cosmic DNA strands. I notice that when I concentrate particularly hard, I can not only slow time but reverse it in small pockets, watching shattered glass flow upward to reform broken windows, and scattered papers dance backward through the air to reassemble themselves.

The dream takes on a surreal quality as I realize that the more people I save, the more transparent my hands become. I'm gradually fading from existence, as if the price for manipulating time is my own physical presence in it. Yet I feel no fear – only a profound sense of purpose and connection to every single person in this frozen moment of crisis.

The last thing I see before the dream begins to dissolve is my own reflection in a building's glass facade – I've become a being of pure light, a temporal guardian suspended between seconds, watching over a world held breath by breath in the balance of time.
