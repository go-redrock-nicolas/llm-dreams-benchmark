I am dreaming. I am floating in space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I feel light and free, unencumbered by gravity and
restraint.  I see myself standing on a cliff, overlooking a vast ocean.  The waves crash against the rocks below, sending
sprays of foam into the air.  I hear the sound of wind rustling through trees, and birds singing in harmony.  I smell the scent
of flowers blooming in springtime.  

I realize that I am judging myself for traits I haven't fully accepted in myself.  I am working with this mirror of projection,
which is showing me a distorted version of my personality, based on my own assumptions and expectations.  I see how I compare
my appearance to others', wishing I were taller or thinner or more beautiful.  I see how I evaluate my intelligence, wondering
if I'm smart enough or knowledgeable enough.  I see how I assess my emotions, questioning if they're valid or appropriate.  

I decide that I don't want to judge myself for these traits anymore.  I don't want to accept them fully either; I just want to be
myself without feeling ashamed or insecure.  So I start making changes in my dream world.

I take off my shoes and socks, feeling the sand between my toes.  I walk down the cliff, toward the water, until it reaches my
ankles.  I plunge into the waves, letting them carry me away.  I swim with the dolphins and sea lions, playing with them for
hours.

I climb a tree, perching on a branch high above the ground.  I survey the landscape, admiring its beauty and diversity.
I pluck some fruit from the branches, eating them with relish.

I build a fire, roasting some meat over it.  I sit around it with my imaginary friends, talking about philosophy and
religion.

As I do these things, I feel my ego dissolving, merging with the universe.  I become one with nature, wild and free.  

When I wake up, I still have those traits that I haven't fully accepted in myself.  But I also have a sense of freedom and
liberation that I didn't have before.  And that makes all the difference.
