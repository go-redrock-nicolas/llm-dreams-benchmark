I am dreaming. **The Dream of Whispering Leaves**  

I am dreaming.  

The world around me is a blur of muted colors, like an old watercolor painting left out in the rain. Yet, among the indistinct shapes and half-finished forms, one thing stands out with startling clarity: a single, crumpled leaf, drifting lazily to the ground.  

Everyone else walks past it—some step over it, some crush it beneath their shoes without noticing. But to me, it is the most mesmerizing thing I have ever seen. The veins of the leaf stretch like tiny rivers, pulsing faintly with a light that isn’t quite of this world. I kneel, picking it up gingerly, and as my fingers brush its surface, it trembles.  

Then, it whispers.  

Not in words, not in any language I know, but in impressions—warm sunlight through a canopy, the sigh of wind through branches, the slow, ancient song of roots deep in the earth. The leaf is not just a leaf. It is a memory, a living scrap of some grander story forgotten by the waking world.  

Compelled, I lift my gaze and suddenly realize that all the leaves on the ground are whispering too, a murmuring chorus just beneath the threshold of hearing. Nobody else seems to notice. The passersby continue their hurried pace, their faces blank, their ears filled only with the noise of their own thoughts.  

But I have to know where they come from.  

Drawn by an instinct deeper than reason, I follow the rustling trail of fallen leaves—each one glowing faintly, each humming with secrets. The farther I go, the more the world unravels, peeling back like layers of old wallpaper. The buildings bend like trees, the sidewalks ripple like roots breaking through stone, and the sky above shifts from blue to a deep, infinite green.  

At last, I stand before an enormous, gnarled tree—one that feels both ageless and newborn. Its trunk is wide as a cathedral, its bark etched with symbols that rearrange themselves as I watch. And from its branches, leaves fall in slow, deliberate spirals.  

Each one carries a dream.  

Not just my dreams—everyone’s. Forgotten wishes, childhood fantasies, the soft hum of a lullaby half remembered. They drift down like snowflakes, settling in my hands, against my skin, dissolving into my breath.  

And then, just as I reach out to touch the tree itself—  

—I wake.  

But for a moment, just a moment, I swear I can still hear the leaves whispering.
