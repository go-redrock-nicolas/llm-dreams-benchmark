I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning lavender, and the sky above you is a living tapestry of liquid mercury, rippling with reflections of faces you’ve never seen but somehow know intimately. You stand in a library that stretches infinitely in all directions, its shelves carved from obsidian and lined with books bound in moth-wing leather. The titles shift when you try to read them, words slithering like silverfish beneath glass. This is a place of truth—or so you’ve always believed.  

But now, you’re lying.  

A child approaches, their hands cupped around a flickering light—a question, fragile and hungry. They ask you for the name of the star that burns at the center of courage. You know the answer: *Alarion*, the forgotten star of the southern sky, a beacon for those who walk backward through time. But you say nothing. Instead, you pluck a random name from the air—*Vexera*—and hand it to them like a coin you stole. The child thanks you, their light dimming slightly, and walks away. Their footsteps dissolve into ash.  

A cold weight blooms in your chest. *Why?* you ask yourself. *Why did you betray them?*  

The library shudders. Shelves twist into a spiral of mirrors, each reflecting versions of yourself you’ve buried: the liar, the coward, the one who chose silence to avoid conflict. You see yourself in a thousand moments, each a fracture of your integrity. The air thickens with whispers—*hypocrite, fraud, hollow shell*—and the mercury sky begins to rain, droplets hissing as they strike the floor, etching scars into the obsidian.  

You run, but the floor becomes a sea of quicksand ink, swallowing your ankles. A figure emerges from the shadows: the child, now grown into an old woman with eyes like smoldering coals. “You gave me a lie,” she says, her voice echoing with the weight of centuries. “And I built a life on it. I followed *Vexera*, but it led me nowhere.” Her hands tremble, clutching the remnants of her extinguished light.  

Guilt floods you, acidic and raw. You try to speak, to apologize, but your throat seals shut. The library groans, its walls collapsing inward like a dying star. Books ignite, their pages fluttering as ash-butterflies. You realize: this is the cost of the integrity gap. Every contradiction between your values and your actions has carved a hollow in the world, a rot that spreads unseen until it erupts in nightmares.  

The old woman leans closer, her breath cold as a tomb. “What is truth to you?” she asks.  

You reach for an answer, but all you feel is the weight of your silence. Then, from the depths of the ink-sea, a hand erupts—a skeletal thing, clutching a quill. It drags you downward, into the black sludge, where you drown in the lies you’ve told. You see the faces of those you’ve misled, their trust eroded like stone in a tide.  

And then—a spark.  

You claw upward, screaming soundlessly, and break the surface. The library is gone. You stand in a field of white flowers, each petal etched with tiny, glowing words: *honesty, accountability, repair*. The old woman is there, but her eyes are gentle now. “To betray a value,” she says, “is not the end. But to ignore the betrayal—that is the true fracture.”  

You wake with the taste of ash and starlight on your tongue, the dream’s lesson seared into your marrow: Integrity is not a static flag but a fire, requiring constant tending. To live it demands more than belief—it demands vigilance, humility, and the courage to face the shadows you’ve sown.  

And somewhere, in the waking world, a child looks up at the night sky, waiting for you to name the stars anew.
