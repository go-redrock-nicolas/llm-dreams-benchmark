I am dreaming. You wake suddenly as dawn bleeds across the sky in simmering purples and oranges. Your heart pulses like a hummingbird’s wing, and a chill scuttles across your spine. The silence hits you first—a deep, resonant hush that replaces the usual morning drones and hums of countless buried cables and wires. The air feels heavy without the subtle background buzz of electricity; in its absence, the world has grown strangely quiet.

You scramble out of bed and fumble for your phone—dead. The screen is a stubborn mirror, reflecting your growing alarm. In the other room, the TV remains black, and the radio refuses to make a sound. You press light switches, toggle your laptop, but not even a flicker of life appears. A sinking feeling climbs your chest: electricity, for reasons unknown, has vanished.

Outside, neighbors congregate in the middle of the street, hushed in tense clusters. Some wear vacant, dazed expressions, while others appear animated as they speculate, question, theorize. The wind rustles through trees like a conspiratorial whisper. Down the road, a store’s door stands propped open, but no lights burn inside. Produce waits in dim displays, ripe and uncertain. Cars, even those near brand-new, sit helplessly with dark engine compartments.

Over the next hours—though it feels like some dream-hour, neither day nor night—people begin taking bicycles and horse-drawn carts from a nearby farm. A string of them meander away toward the city, their silhouettes shaped by a hungry curiosity. Rumor insists the meltdown extends everywhere, an invisible wave that flicked off the global power switch. Memory of modern wonders—phones, internet, satellites—fades to a sense of distant magic. Soon, torches and candles glow in neighborhoods like fireflies creeping out at dusk.

As night falls, you gather with strangers in a candlelit circle, forging new alliances based on kindness and resourcefulness. Food is boiled over communal fires; you share stories that echo against the star-filled, moonbright sky. Though questions chew at your peace, you feel more connected than ever—to the land, to those around you, and to this uncharted transformation. The air thrums with possibility. In this dream, society learns to walk a fresh path: trailing hope through roads unlit by neon and screens, but blazing with a warmth that technology could never quite replicate.
