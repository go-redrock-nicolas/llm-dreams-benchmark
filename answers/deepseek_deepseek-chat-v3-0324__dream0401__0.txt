I am dreaming. And in this dream, I find myself walking down an endless hallway lined with mirrors—but the mirrors aren't reflections of the present. No, they flicker like old film reels, showing snippets of every misstep, every stumble, every time my voice cracked mid-sentence or my hands fumbled a task. The air hums with whispers, sharp as broken glass: *"Why did you say that?" "You always ruin things." "They're laughing at you."*  

Then—a shift. The hallway trembles. One mirror, larger than the rest, ripples like water. Tentatively, I reach out, and my fingertips meet not cold glass, but something warm, almost breathing. The surface softens, and suddenly I'm through it, standing in a meadow under a sky streaked with twilight. The grass sways, lit by fireflies that pulse in time with my heartbeat.  

A figure awaits me there—a version of myself, but softer, eyes holding galaxies of quiet understanding. They extend a hand, and in their palm rests a small, glowing seed. *"You've carried thorns for so long,"* they murmur. *"Plant this instead."*  

As I press the seed into the earth, the ground trembles—not with fear, but possibility. Vines erupt, weaving a tapestry of blossoms that hum in harmonious chords. Each flower bears a face: my face, but radiant, unapologetic. They sing in unison, *"We are made of stardust and second chances."*  

The old hallway of mirrors collapses behind me, its shards dissolving into firefly light. I wake, not with a start, but with a slow, syrup-sweet awareness: the critic’s voice was never my own. It was a ghost I fed, and now—I choose to feast on kinder words.
