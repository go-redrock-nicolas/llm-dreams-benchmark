I am dreaming. I find myself suddenly embraced by a family whose faces bear no resemblance to mine, in a home where the air carries unfamiliar spices and the walls speak a history I've never known. I've been adopted into the Ramasamy household in a remote village in southern India, where the morning begins with prayers before a shrine adorned with marigolds and brass figurines of deities whose names still tangle on my tongue.

The grandmother—they call her Paati—takes my hands each morning, her skin like warm parchment against mine. She teaches me to draw kolam patterns with rice flour at dawn, intricate geometric designs that grace the threshold of their home. My fingers fumble where hers flow with practiced grace, and though she speaks no language I understand, her gentle corrections and approving nods form our own dialect.

During the harvest festival, I'm wrapped in a silk saree of deep crimson and gold, the fabric seemingly endless as my new sister Divya drapes and pleats it around me with patient hands. The weight of the gold jewelry they place on me feels like both honor and burden—family heirlooms meant for a daughter of their blood, now entrusted to me.

At dinner, I sit cross-legged on the floor, still unaccustomed to eating with my right hand from banana leaves. The father—Appa—watches with kind eyes that crinkle at the corners when I successfully scoop up rasam rice without spilling. But at night, I weep silently beneath a mosquito net, caught between gratitude and a profound sense of displacement.

Dreams within this dream come in Tamil, a language my sleeping mind somehow understands though my waking self does not. In these nested dreams, I dance Bharatanatyam with perfect precision, my feet striking rhythms that tell stories of gods and heroes.

When the monsoon arrives, the air thick with moisture and anticipation, I find myself standing on the rooftop beside my new brother. He teaches me to launch paper boats into the torrential downpour, explaining that they carry our sorrows away. I watch mine sail over the edge, disappeared into the gray curtain of rain, and feel something shift within me—neither belonging nor estrangement, but something new taking root.
