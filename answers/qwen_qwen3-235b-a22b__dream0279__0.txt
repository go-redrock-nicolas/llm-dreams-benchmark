I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt lavender, a fragrance that clings to your skin like a memory you can’t quite place. You’re standing at the edge of a vast, glassy lake, its surface reflecting not the sky, but a swirling void of fractured constellations and inverted mountains. This is the third time you’ve crossed this lake in your quest to reach the Citadel of Echoes—a spire of obsidian and light that hovers just beyond the horizon, always retreating as you approach. Each attempt has ended in failure: first, the ice beneath your feet cracked, swallowing your tools; second, a flock of winged serpents with mirrors for scales forced you back; now, this—your boots sink into the liquid glass, and the stars in the water scream as you step on them, their voices like shattering chimes.  

You’ve come to steal the Heart of the Citadel, a gem said to hold the blueprint of all forgotten things. It’s the only way to revive your sister, whose body lies frozen in a cocoon of amber roots back in the waking world. But the dream knows your desperation. It twists, punishing you with visions of her laughter dissolving into ash, of your own hands crumbling to dust as you reach for the spire.  

This time, you don’t fight the sinking. You let the glass swallow you.  

The lake gives way to a cavern of teeth. Rows of jagged ivory arch overhead, gnashing slowly, rhythmically, as if chewing the fabric of the dream itself. Blood-red vines pulse along the walls, humming a lullaby in a language older than time. You crawl forward, knees scraping bone, until you find it: a door made of a thousand moth wings, each one etched with a different face—your mother’s, your first love’s, your own, aged and unrecognizable. Behind the door, the Citadel’s heart throbs, visible through a keyhole shaped like an eye.  

But the key is alive. It writhes in your palm, a serpentine thing with tiny, needle-like fangs. It bites your wrist, and your blood becomes ink, pooling in the grooves of your skin to map a path you’d never dared consider: *Inward*.  

You follow the ink. It leads you to a chamber where your childhood self sits, knees hugged to their chest, surrounded by shards of mirrors that reflect not images, but *emotions*—a kaleidoscope of griefs, fears, and stubborn joys you’d buried. The child looks up, eyes twin eclipses, and says, *“You left me here to rot so you could be strong.”* Their voice is both accusation and absolution.  

You kneel. You gather the shards, let them cut you, and drink the blood that wells from your palms. The pain blooms into clarity.  

Suddenly, the Citadel is *inside* you—a labyrinth of ribs and glowing sinew, its spire piercing your own heart. You climb, hand over hand, through veins and shadow, until you grasp the Heart: a pulsing crystal that sings in a chord that unravels every lie you’ve ever told yourself. It burns, but you don’t let go.  

The dream fractures.  

You wake gasping, your sister’s name on your lips, the taste of stardust and iron on your tongue. The room is dim, but your hands—your hands are glowing. And somewhere, faintly, a heartbeat echoes in time with your own.  

The dream wasn’t a test. It was a bridge. And you’ve crossed it.
