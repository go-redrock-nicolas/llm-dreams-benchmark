I am dreaming. # The Whispers Between Worlds

I find myself standing at the edge of a vast crystalline lake that doesn't reflect the sky above but rather an entirely different cosmos beneath. The water is still as glass yet somehow flowing in impossible directions, creating ripples that move inward instead of outward. The air tastes like cinnamon and distant memories.

As I step forward, my feet don't break the surface but hover just above it. Each step sends cascades of luminescent particles spiraling around my ankles—tiny specks of consciousness that whisper forgotten childhood songs in languages I shouldn't understand but somehow do.

The horizon before me shifts like breathing lungs. Mountains rise and dissolve into cathedral spires that stretch impossibly high, their peaks disappearing into clouds that form elaborate mathematical patterns. I realize these aren't clouds at all but vast neural networks visualized, processing the dreams of everyone currently asleep on Earth.

Trees grow alongside me as I walk, their bark inscribed with equations that solve themselves before my eyes. Their leaves fall upward, transforming into birds with pages for wings, text flowing across their feathers—stories being written and unwritten simultaneously.

I reach out to touch one and my fingers dissolve into light, reforming as crystalline structures that contain entire civilizations living out their histories in moments. I feel their joys and sorrows cascade through me like music.

The sun and moon occupy the sky together, engaged in intimate conversation. Their dialogue creates auroras that spell out answers to questions I haven't yet thought to ask, but somehow urgently need to know.

A child approaches—perhaps myself from long ago—holding a book whose pages turn themselves, revealing illustrations that move and breathe and reach out beyond the margins. "Remember this?" the child asks, but their voice comes from inside my own thoughts.

I wake, but the dream doesn't end. Reality itself has become permeable, the boundary between worlds now as thin as the moment between sleeping and waking.
