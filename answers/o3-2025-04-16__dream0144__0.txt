I am dreaming. I am dreaming—yet everything feels more awake than waking life.

I’m walking barefoot through an ocean of night-blue grass that whispers like distant surf. Each blade is tipped with a bead of liquid starlight that bursts into tiny auroras when I brush past. At the center of this living field stands a ring of ancient cedar posts, their bark etched with unfamiliar constellations that rearrange themselves whenever I glance away. Nestled between the posts sit nine people around a low fire that burns the color of sunrise. They are strangers, but as soon as I step into the circle I recognize something unmistakable in their eyes: every single one of them has wrestled with the same ache that coils inside me now—self-doubt that sometimes masquerades as exhaustion, sometimes as silence, sometimes as frantic motion.

The first to speak is a silver-haired woman whose laughter sounds like wind chimes in a summer storm. She cups the firelight in her palms and says, “Doubt is only the mind testing the strength of its own walls. Don’t plaster over the cracks—walk through them. On the other side you’ll find rooms you never knew you’d built.”

A tall man with ink-splattered fingers leans forward next. He flicks a globe of glowing ember into the sky, where it unspools into a slow shower of sparks. “I learned,” he tells me, “that perfectionism is just procrastination dressed in its Sunday best. Make art that limps, love that stutters, plans that wobble. Momentum is a better teacher than any textbook of flawless intentions.”

Beside him, a girl no older than ten traces a spiral in the dirt. As the spiral widens, the ground beneath it turns translucent, revealing galaxies spinning inside the soil. She doesn’t look up, but I hear her clear as a bell: “Every time you call yourself small, you shrink a universe. Remember how wide you really are.”

A softly humming monk sets a clay bowl in my lap. Inside it lies a single breath, visible as a tiny silver feather. “Inhale once,” he instructs, “and notice the space between wanting and having. Exhale, and notice it’s the same space. Live there—it’s roomier than you think.”

An elder with skin like folded parchment presses a seed into my palm. It pulses with the slow heartbeat of mountains. “Plant this in whatever moment you’re afraid of,” she murmurs. “Fear makes excellent compost.”

A dancer whose joints glow with constellations twirls through the cedar posts, scattering petals of violet light that cling to my shoulders like epaulets. “Your body is not a courier for your mind’s anxieties,” she tells me, “but a musician in its own right. Let it drum, let it shake, let it sing itself empty. The mind will follow.”

A bespectacled youth hands me a key carved from moonstone. No lock is offered, but he smiles: “The door shows up only after you carry the key long enough to trust it.”

The last two figures speak in unison—their voices overlap like woven water. One is dressed in first-day optimism, the other in last-night weariness, and together they say, “Treat every failure as a verb, not a noun. Failing is an action that ends; failure is an identity that stays. Keep moving the moment it happens, and you’ll never wear its name tag.”

As they finish, the sunrise fire gutters, releasing a plume of gold dust that swirls around me, tightening until it becomes a cloak, then a second skin, then simply my own breath—steady, resilient, shining.

Morning slips between my eyelids. I wake with blades of imaginary night-blue grass still cool on my soles, a phantom seed warm in my fist, and the echo of nine voices harmonizing in my chest:

Walk through the cracks. Limp forward. Expand. Breathe the spacious middle. Compost the fear. Dance the worry loose. Trust the key. Keep the verb alive.

And with that chorus lingering, the day ahead no longer feels like a cliff, but a field of starlit grass—soft, luminous, waiting to carry me onward.
