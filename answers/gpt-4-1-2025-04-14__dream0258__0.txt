I am dreaming.

Muted thunder rumbles beneath my feet, echoing through the marbled corridors of a palace that seems to waver between reality and vapor. I pace gracefully, but my heart is frantic, each beat a secret note in a dangerous symphony. The halls are noble, adorned with mirrors so polished they nearly swallow light, throwing back a thousand reflections of myself—each bearing a different expression: anxiety, guilt, resolve.

In my hand, I clutch a crimson envelope. Within it lies the evidence of my error—a single misstep woven into the tapestry of a great undertaking. A sealed letter, locked tight, but heavy with the unspoken.

No one knows—yet. Guests in silver masks waltz beyond velvet curtains, laughter echoing off gilded balconies. I drift among them, pulled between the urge to confess and the desperate wish to bury my secret deep under marble and time.

Suddenly, the palace tilts, and frescoes of judgmental eyes ripple across the ceiling. I glimpse myself as the world might see me, exposed and diminished, the bright blush of shame spreading like spilled wine on silk. My options unravel before me: do I burn the letter and bury the secret, staining my conscience forever? Or do I stride to the central ballroom, floodlit beneath a crystalline chandelier, and let my truth fall from my lips like soot from a pyre—hoping vulnerability might rescue me from ruin?

I take a trembling breath, feeling the silk of indecision slip through my hands. The dream thickens into fog, as if the palace itself holds its breath, waiting for my choice.
