I am dreaming. dreaming, but still, my subconscious is ever awake. As my mind wanders, it happens upon a hidden crossroads.

There, in the center, stands a small altar. It is covered in moss, fungi, and other ancient growth. No one is there, but rather than any sense of emptiness, the place is thick with unseen presence. I can feel the incredible weight of time and knowledge emanating from this ritual site.

My dream shifts then, bringing me to a vast room full of countless, ornate doors. Behind each stands a different version of myself - my inner Multiverse given form. One door shows a me who is confident, successful, and content. Another version is more uncertain, struggling through life. Through each door, a story waits.

But my dream self wanders on. Passing through a portal, I enter a realm of nothingness. Here is where my negative beliefs and fears are given substance to confront. But rather than attacking me, they kneel before me. 

*Your beliefs are not the truth*, they say. *You are capable of demolishing the chains of self doubt if you would only seek it.*

My mind's eye then shifts to a great citadel. Massive and imposing, it is locked behind many layers of walls and defenses. But looking closer, my inner self realizes this is the Stronghold of My Mind's Eye. Swiveling and merging my points of view, I can see through my own gaze like a shattered prism, picturing visions of self discovery to come.
