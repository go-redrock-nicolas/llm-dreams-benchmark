I am dreaming. The air here is thick and syrupy, like entering a twilight saucer filled with honeyed breath. Time wobbles—either dragging itself forward with the effort of an ox in mud or skipping ahead in sly, pirouetting moments I can't grasp. I am standing on a bridge made of melting clock faces, each second dripping like wax into a sky below me, where stars bloom like lilies on a pond of obsidian.

And within me, something is shifting.  

I look down at my hands and realize they are no longer my own.

The first skin I wear is made of bright parchment—brittle with maps of forgotten cities. This is the self I showed to the college symposium, where I debated Kant with a sincerity sharp enough to cut glass. That part of me is all structure and strategy, a vault of quotes and justifications, performing awareness like a pianist performing a nocturne – brilliantly, precisely, but without song in the heart.

Then the parchment peels back like an ancient scroll, revealing a second layer: fluid, iridescent, changing color with each breath I take. This is the self that walked through crowded subway stations whispering to strangers, the part of me that laughs with abandon at absurdity, that cries alone under the shower’s spray. It is chameleon-hearted, alive in the glow of shared secrets and sidelong glances, flourishing in the intimacy of collapsing into a friend’s presence, unscripted and raw.

Suddenly, the colors around me pulse violently, and a third shape steps forward. This part of me is shadow-thick and coiled in silence—a quiet that cuts deeper than screams. I remember wearing this skin in the graveyard hours when the world falls away and you are left bare beneath the night sky. This self fears no mask, for it is the watcher at the window, the one voice which does not speak but sees—sees all the illusions, all the brittle constructs, and the spinning around emptiness.

Above, the sky splits open.

A fourth me emerges—golden, molten, speaking in tones that blur into the sound of thunder meeting music. This is the part of me that dreams like this—wild-eyed, myth-pulsed, dancing in panoramas where logic is barefoot and time wears no crown. It i_s_ the dream. Not hunting truth, but *becoming.*

These versions swirl like ink in water, never entirely separate yet never at rest.

I am all of them.

A kaleidoscope self.

Shifting with every gaze, every breath, every echo down the corridors of who I *am not* and who I *could be.*

The dream sings…



And I begin to dissolve.
