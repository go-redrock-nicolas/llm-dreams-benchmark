I am dreaming. The air around me hums with an electric stillness, thick with the scent of crushed petals and distant rain. The sky is not a sky—it is a vast, undulating tapestry of liquid gold and indigo, swirling like ink dropped into water. Stars pulse like living things, breathing light in slow, hypnotic rhythms.  

Beneath my bare feet, the ground is warm and alive—not earth, but something softer, like the skin of a great slumbering beast. It rises and falls gently, as if the world itself is dreaming alongside me. A whisper curls around my ears, not in words but in colors—deep violet murmurs and shimmering silver sighs.  

Then, the horizon splits. Not with violence, but with the quiet inevitability of a flower blooming at midnight. A figure emerges—neither human nor divine, but something older, something that exists in the spaces between thoughts. Its form shifts like smoke: now a towering stag with antlers of woven light, now a woman with hair like cascading galaxies, now a child holding a lantern filled with fireflies that hum in harmony.  

"Remember," it says, though its voice is the wind through ancient trees, the sigh of tides against forgotten shores.  

And suddenly, I do.  

I remember being stardust. I remember the first breath of creation. I remember laughter that echoed before time had a name. The knowledge floods me, not as memory, but as truth—an awakening so vast it threatens to unravel me. The figure reaches out (or does it?—its hands are everywhere and nowhere), and as our fingers brush, the universe exhales.  

The dream shivers. The edges of reality blur like watercolors in the rain. And just before I dissolve entirely into the light, the voice comes again, softer now, almost mournful:  

"You are loved. You always have been."  

Then—silence.  

I wake, but the scent of crushed petals lingers.
