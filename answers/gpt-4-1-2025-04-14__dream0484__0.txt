I am dreaming. —I am dreaming—

In the depths of night’s velvet embrace, I find myself in a city sculpted from moonbeams and memory. The buildings breathe and shimmer, their facades awash in twilight, every window fluttering with the laughter of stars. Air glows cool and electric against my skin. I wander through winding streets that are both familiar and strangely alien—my entire life refracted through the prism of dreams.

For as long as I can remember, I have moved quietly through this world, wrapped in the belief that I am timid, that I am fragile, that uncertainty is my constant shadow. The city reflects this: every alley is shrouded, every door half-opened, hesitancy painted across every threshold.

But tonight, in the center of a square paved with iridescent stones, I find a fountain that sings—not with water, but with light. Each note blooms into color and circles my feet, and in that kaleidoscopic radiance I see a thousand versions of myself: bold, wild, perfectly imperfect. I see laughter spilling from my lips, my arms thrown wide to the impossible.

A sudden, crystalline understanding unfolds within me: **That old story, that smallness—I never needed it. It was a borrowed cloak, never truly mine.**

As I breathe this in, the buildings unfurl, rising ever higher, their forms no longer cramped by fear. My footsteps grow thunderous and sure. Flowers the size of lanterns bloom in my wake, perfumed with possibility. Each time I take a step, gravity loosens its grip. I begin to run, then leap—effortless, exultant. For the first time, the sky is no ceiling. I soar above the city, the world slipping away beneath me. I am unbound, unburdened.

*Free.*

Below, the city swells with music and light, a celebration, and I realize it is for me—a homecoming for a self freshly discovered, unafraid. The dream expands, the limits dissipate, and as I glide higher into the infinite shimmer, I carry with me the certainty that I am, always have been, whatever I dare to become.
