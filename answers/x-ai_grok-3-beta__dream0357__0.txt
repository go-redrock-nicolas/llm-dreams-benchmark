I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me unfurls like a tapestry woven from the threads of both wonder and dread. The air is thick with a strange, electric hum, a vibration that seems to resonate deep within my bones. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, obsidian cliff, jagged and unforgiving, stretching endlessly into a horizon swallowed by a twilight that burns with shades of violet and crimson. Below, a churning sea roils, its waves not of water but of liquid shadow, whispering secrets of the void as they crash against the rock with a sound like a thousand mournful cries.  

I can feel my heart thudding in my chest, each beat a stark reminder of the fragility I’ve only just come to understand. Just hours ago—or was it a lifetime?—I narrowly escaped a peril so visceral it still clings to my skin like a cold sweat. Perhaps it was a beast with eyes of molten gold, its claws raking the air inches from my face, or a plummet from a crumbling precipice, my fingers scrabbling against stone as gravity tugged me toward oblivion. The memory is a blur, but the lesson remains etched into my soul: I am mortal, a fleeting spark in an endless dark.  

As I stand here, processing this existential truth, the wind rises, carrying with it the scent of ash and forgotten things. It tousles my hair with ghostly fingers, urging me to look inward. My breath catches as I notice my reflection in a glassy shard of rock protruding from the cliffside. But it is not just my face I see—my eyes are hollow, flickering with the faint glow of stars, and my skin seems to shimmer, translucent, as if I am already half-unraveled from this world. I reach out to touch the reflection, and my fingers pass through it, sending ripples across the surface. A voice, ancient and resonant, murmurs from the depths of the mirrored stone: “To know death is to know life. Will you embrace it, or flee?”  

Before I can answer, the ground beneath me trembles, and the cliff begins to fracture, spiderweb cracks racing toward me with a sound like shattering glass. I turn to run, but there is nowhere to go—behind me stretches an endless desert of bone-white sand, littered with the husks of colossal, skeletal creatures whose remains glow faintly with bioluminescent light. Their ribs arc like cathedral spires, casting long, eerie shadows that seem to beckon me closer. I hesitate, torn between the crumbling cliff and the unknown ahead, my mortality a weight that drags at every step.  

Then, from the heart of the desert, a figure emerges. It is humanoid but not human, its form sculpted from the same liquid shadow as the sea below, its eyes two blazing embers that pierce through the dim light. It moves with an unnatural grace, silent as a whisper, and though I should feel fear, I am drawn to it, as if it holds the answers to the questions burning in my chest. As it nears, I see that it carries something in its hands—a small, pulsating orb of light, no larger than a pearl, yet radiating a warmth that banishes the chill from my bones.  

“Take it,” the figure intones, its voice a chorus of echoes, as if spoken by many and none. “It is the spark of your essence, the tether to your fleeting time. Guard it, or surrender it.” I reach out, trembling, and as my fingers close around the orb, a flood of memories surges through me—every laugh, every tear, every quiet moment of awe beneath a starlit sky. But with them comes the weight of every loss, every fear, every near-miss that has led me to this cliff’s edge. My mortality is no longer an abstract thought; it is a living, breathing thing, pulsing in my hands.  

The figure steps back, dissolving into the wind, and I am left alone once more, clutching the orb as the desert begins to shift. The bone-white sand rises in swirling vortexes, reshaping itself into towering forms—faces of those I’ve loved, those I’ve lost, their expressions a mix of sorrow and hope. They speak no words, but their gazes implore me to choose: to hold fast to this fragile light, to live with the knowledge of my end, or to cast it into the shadowy sea and forget, to drift into numbness.  

My chest tightens as I look down at the orb, its light flickering like a candle in a storm. The cliff continues to crumble behind me, the desert looms ahead, and the sea below sings its siren song of surrender. I stand at the crossroads of existence, my mortality a mirror reflecting both terror and beauty, and as I take a step forward—toward what, I do not yet know—the dream trembles, the edges blurring, as if the choice itself might wake me from this vivid, haunting reverie.
