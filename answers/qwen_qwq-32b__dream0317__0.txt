I am dreaming. The air shimmers with a faint iridescence, like the surface of oil on water but undisturbed by any ripples. I take a step forward and my foot sinks into the ground, which feels like walking on the inside of a watercolor painting—every hue bleeding gently into the next. Before me rises a tower, not built of stone or any recognizable material, but constructed from what looks like solidified music. The walls hum melodies only I can hear, notes coiling around me like spectral arms. I reach out to touch them, and the structure responds, vibrating in a harmony that makes my bones hum. A door materializes without hinges or frame, a perfect circle floating midair. I step through, finding myself in a library where the books have no covers, their stories swirling above them in three dimensions—myths made of fireflies, equations that taste like stardust when read aloud. A shadow with a voice like wind chimes offers me a choice: to become a creature of pure light or a river that flows backward in time. The shadow laughs, and the world dissolves into the scent of rain on hot lava.
