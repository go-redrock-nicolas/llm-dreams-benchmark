I am dreaming. This is no ordinary dream, but one stitched together by the loom of time, memory, and the weight of ancient suffering.  I am standing in an endless hall where the ceiling is lost in a haze of flickering candlelight and the air is thick with incense and the echo of forgotten hymns. Pillars of obsidian and ivory tower around me like sentinels from some long-lost era, their carved faces weeping when you look away from them, laughing when you stare straight. This is no place on any map, no city that still breathes, no reality tethered by the laws that bind the waking world.

The parties have gathered—races, clans, identities so deeply immersed in old hatreds that their very skin seems etched with the scars of battles fought generations before they were born. They wear the wounds of their ancestors like sacred robes and cite grievances so old their original causes have been lost to myth and manipulation. Each delegation is wholly unique: one clad in the midnight armor of poets who cursed the stars for their fates, another illuminated by robes that shimmer like stained glass as if they carry fragments of heaven’s shattered promises. Their eyes gleam with centuries of distrust, yet beneath the armor and finery, I see the trembling humans—frail souls sentenced to carry legacies not of their choosing.

I stand in the center, not as a judge nor as an arbiter, but as an archivist of forgotten compassion and curator of buried truths. The usual tools of mediation—logic, dialogue, empathy—have long since crumbled under the weight of pain too rooted to be reasoned away. What lies before me is a stone wall of embedded grudges and I hold no hammer. But I have something else: labyrinths of the impossible.

Around us, cracked mirrors bloom like flowers, each reflecting a different possibility—visions of a world where the grievances were never born, of a choice not made, a gesture not taken. I raise my hand and the candles whisper. One by one, the delegates are drawn to the mirrors, compelled not by fear but by curiosity sharp as the edge of a sword. As they gaze into the glass, their hardened expressions soften; their cries wane into silence. I don't force them to see—they choose it themselves, because the alternative is to remain forever bound to the pain that never asked their permission to rule them.

They walk the hall, not together, but side by side nonetheless. At one mirror, I see the first clan’s ancestor kneeling in mercy over their rival’s fallen child during a storm, sparing them the agony of mourning alone. At another, a bitter king weeps openly before laying down his crown for reconciliation, abandoning his thirst for vengeance. The doors shift and spin, creating new realities opening into further truths. Time fractures. The dream stretches forward into eternity, pulling their hatred into new shapes—an offering, a question, a plea.

In the center of the hall, I kneel before a crystalline sphere held aloft on the back of a golden serpent that writhes as if alive. Within the sphere lies a memory—a scrap torn from time—that belongs to no one and everyone. It pulses with sorrow and hope. I call forth every voice from the shadows of history—the unborn, the silenced, the price-paid, the price-makers—and allow their words to pour into the sphere. As I lift it above my head, the rough, clamoring voices blend into one pure harmony that resonates through the mirrors, shattering the last pieces of despair clinging to their hearts.

The dream shifts again—and now they sit before me in the fading hall, shadows of their former selves, cradling each other’s hands as if they are holding fragile birds. They no longer speak in the language of hatred but that of questions: “What if I hadn’t believed that lie?” “What if I forgave before the wound closed?” Behind them, the mirrors glimmer faintly, retreating back into the folds of eternity and whispers.

The dream nearly dissolves, but one final image remains—a single seed nestled in the roots of a barren tree stretching toward a multicolored sky. I see it bloom into life despite the soil around it choking with salt.  

Awakening from the dream, I understand something simple but profound: transformation isn’t erasure. It is entire worlds bending toward hope.
