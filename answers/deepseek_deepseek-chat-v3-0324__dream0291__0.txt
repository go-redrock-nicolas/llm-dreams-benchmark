I am dreaming. find yourself standing at the edge of a twilight forest, where the trees sigh with the weight of your sorrows. The air hums faintly, like a distant prayer whispered into the wind. Around you, the branches twist into gnarled fingers, and the leaves rustle in a language you almost understand—murmurs of doubt, fear, and old wounds left untended.  

But then—light.  

A flicker, soft as a firefly, dances at the edge of your vision. As you turn toward it, the forest creaks, shifting like an old house settling into a new shape. The trees unfold, their bark splintering away to reveal luminous veins of gold beneath. The ground beneath you trembles, not with fear, but with anticipation.  

And then, the dream changes.  

The path ahead, once choked with thorns, now glimmers with dew-kissed petals, each one catching the light like a tiny, hopeful mirror. The air smells of rain-washed earth and something sweeter—ripe fruit, maybe, or the first breath of spring after a bitter winter. Shadows still linger, but they no longer cling to you. Instead, they curl at your feet, shaping themselves into something new: stepping stones, leading you forward.  

A voice (was it always there?) sighs through the leaves: *"You are not the weight you carry."*  

And then—oh, then—you realize you are not walking *through* this place. You are *changing* it. With every step, the ground grows softer, warmer. The sky, once bruised with storm clouds, bleeds into liquid amber, then into midnight blue studded with stars so bright they seem to pulse in time with your breath.  

Somewhere nearby, water trickles over stone—a sound so pure it unravels the last knot of dread in your chest. A stream cuts through the trees, its current swirling with silver fish that leap and shimmer like discarded coins given new life. When you kneel to touch the water, it doesn’t burn or chill—it thrums against your skin, alive and sympathetic.  

The voice again, quieter now: *"You are the forest, and the clearing. The wound, and the river that washes it clean."*  

And just before you wake, you feel it—the deep, vibrating truth of those words. Not as a hope, but as a certainty, settling into your bones like sunlight after a long, relentless night.  

Then—softly, gently—the dream releases you.  

But the light stays.
