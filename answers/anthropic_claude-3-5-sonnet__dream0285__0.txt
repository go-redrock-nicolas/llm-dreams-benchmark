I am dreaming. The room feels like it's breathing - walls expanding and contracting with a subtle pulse that matches my racing heart. I'm seated in a curved amphitheater of faces, all of them nodding in unanimous agreement while passionate voices echo off the mahogany panels. The truth burns in my throat like a swallowed ember, desperate to escape.

My chair seems to sink lower as others tower above, their shadows stretching impossibly long across the floor. Their words weave together into a humming chorus that grows louder, more insistent. "Obviously this is the only way forward," they say, their certainty becoming almost tangible in the air.

But I see what they don't - glaring flaws in their logic that flash like warning lights. My palms are slick with sweat, and my heart pounds against my ribs like a desperate prisoner. The weight of unspoken words makes my tongue feel heavy as lead.

Suddenly, the air shifts. The room goes quiet enough to hear dust motes settling. My chair begins rising of its own accord, lifting me higher and higher until I'm floating level with the ornate ceiling medallion. Looking down at the sea of upturned faces, I feel a surge of otherworldly confidence.

When I finally speak, my voice emerges as pure light - ribbons of golden truth that dance and spiral through the air, illuminating dark corners of flawed reasoning. The light touches each person in turn, and I watch in wonder as understanding blooms across their faces like flowers opening to the sun.

The dream shifts and swirls, the room dissolving into stars, but the feeling remains - that transcendent moment when fear transformed into power, when silence became symphony. I found my voice not just with words, but with my whole being, and the universe itself seemed to pause and listen.
