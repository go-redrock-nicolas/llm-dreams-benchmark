I am dreaming.

A crimson dusk bruises the sky as I stand atop an observation deck overlooking the sprawling city, its glass and metal skeleton quaking under the approach of something unseen—an unnatural storm, flickering between colors no language has yet named. In the streets below, tides of people surge in confusion along highways lit by the frantic wink of emergency lights. The crisis, once held at bay by careful contingency plans—color-coded maps, barricade drills, automatic messages—has twisted far beyond the familiar ruts of order.

Protocols scroll before me on glowing screens, as rigid and useless as fossilized bones. The exits they dictate now flow directly into the teeth of the growing catastrophe: roads clogged, subways flooded, assembly points lost to the surging, pulsing anomaly. Their logic splinters under the pressure of chaos.

I close my eyes and breathe. In this pivotal moment, imagination must become the new doctrine.

I push aside the glossy tablets. Instead, I seize an old-fashioned loudspeaker, climb onto the platform, and let my voice cut through the panic. Workers and strangers stare up, wild-eyed and searching for direction.

"We abandon the roads and rails," I declare. "We move upward, not outward. Every rooftop, every terrace. Link hands—children in the center, the strongest on the perimeter. In the spaces between our old structures, build ladders from the debris, human chains up the sides of buildings. Find the green spaces: parks, gardens, overpasses cloaked in ivy—these are our sanctuaries now."

Dark rivers of shadow are flooding through the arteries of the city. As I organize teams, someone finds an old city blueprint—forgotten sky bridges and maintenance hatches, secret channels above and below, ignored even by the protocols. With this forgotten knowledge, we guide families up spiral staircases and onto rooftops. Networked, the city’s skin tingles with hope.

Above, the storm’s geometry bends and shivers, seeming to hesitate as the city's inhabitants cluster in these unorthodox havens, lit not by fear but by the glow of emergency lanterns and the warmth of one another.

Alarms still wail in the distance, but within our chosen sanctuaries there is a pulse of calm—an unspoken understanding that, in this hour, we are weaving a new system from the fiber of our shared will and ingenuity. The chaos below becomes a distant roar, almost like the surf. The sky’s impossible colors begin to recede, drawn back and tamed—not by any prepared plan, but by our stubborn, spontaneous unity.

I awaken just as the first rays of sunlight break through the dissipating clouds, painting the survivors with trembling gold, and I remember: sometimes the deepest order arises not from rules, but from the relentless, creative refusal to give in.
