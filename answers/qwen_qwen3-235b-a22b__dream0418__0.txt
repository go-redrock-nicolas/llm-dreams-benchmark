I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a desert of glass dunes, their crystalline ridges refracting light into prismatic shards that cut the air with cold fire. You walk barefoot, the ground humming beneath your steps, each footfall sending ripples through the fragile landscape. The sky is a bruised violet, streaked with slow-moving constellations that blink like half-lidded eyes. You are alone, yet the sensation of being watched prickles your spine—a thousand invisible gazes, featherlight and patient, pooling in the hollows of your loneliness.  

Ahead, a city rises, suspended on the horizon like a mirage. Its towers are woven from smoke and thread, their spires unraveling into the wind, reknitting themselves when you blink. You crave its warmth, the promise of voices, laughter, hands clasped in yours. But your legs refuse to quicken. Your breath turns shallow, a trapped bird in your throat, as though the closer you draw, the more the air itself thickens into a syrupy resistance. The city flickers—a heartbeat, a taunt—and suddenly, it’s behind you. You never moved.  

A figure materializes in the distance, their silhouette jagged, as though assembled from broken mirrors. They beckon. You yearn to run to them, but your feet sink into the glass, which now flows like liquid, sharp and weightless. Their voice arrives not as sound but as a vibration in your bones: *“You build your solitude like a fortress, yet scream into its walls at night. Why?”*  

You try to answer, but your mouth fills with sand. Spit it out—no, not sand. Words. Dozens of them, carved from obsidian, clattering to the ground. *“Afraid,”* you manage, the syllable splintering into a thousand echoes. The figure tilts their head, and for a moment, you see your own face reflected in their fractured body—eyes wide with hunger, hands clawed and grasping, yet perpetually outstretched.  

The ground cracks open. From the fissure blooms a garden of flowers made of smoke and static, their petals hissing. To reach them, you must cross a bridge of your own ribs, arched and gleaming over the abyss. The flowers whisper secrets: *“They will leave. They will laugh. They will see the cracks and turn away.”* You hesitate, the bridge trembling with every conflicted thought. Behind you, the city dissolves into a flock of crows, each bird dropping a mirror shard that spells out a name you once loved but can’t now remember.  

The figure presses a hand to your chest. Beneath your skin, your heart is a trapped moth, battering its wings. *“To be seen,”* they say, *“is to risk annihilation. But to hide is to starve.”* The garden withers. The bridge collapses. You fall—not downward, but inward—and land in a room you’ve never been in yet know intimately. A child’s bedroom, walls papered with constellations, a window open to a moon that watches, unblinking. On the bed sits your younger self, clutching a jar of fireflies that glow too brightly, their light etched with the faces of strangers you once let slip away.  

You wake with the taste of static on your tongue, the dream’s question coiled in your gut like a serpent eating its own tail. The loneliness remains, but now it pulses with a strange, electric heat—a wound, yes, but also a compass.
