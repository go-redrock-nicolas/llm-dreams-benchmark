I am dreaming. I find myself in a peculiar crystalline chamber where the walls pulse with an ethereal blue light that seems to respond to my anxious thoughts about the looming social gathering. As I explore this space, my apprehension materializes as shimmering threads of silver that weave through the air, forming intricate patterns that mirror my racing thoughts.

The chamber begins to transform, its walls becoming translucent and revealing countless scenes from past social events - moments of genuine laughter, warm embraces, and meaningful connections. Yet these joyful memories appear distorted, as if viewed through rippling water, while my current anxiety manifests as dark, swirling clouds that attempt to obscure them.

I reach out to touch one of the memory-walls, and suddenly I'm split into multiple versions of myself - one confidently engaging in conversation, another hiding in corners, and a third observing it all with analytical detachment. Each version wears clothes made of different emotions: the confident self draped in warm golden light, the hiding self wrapped in shadows, and the observer clothed in mirrors that reflect everything around it.

The floor beneath me becomes a pool of liquid memories, each ripple showing flashes of previous gatherings where my pre-event anxiety proved unfounded. As I wade through these memories, they begin to climb up my body like friendly vines, each one whispering reassurances in voices that sound like friends I've known and loved.

Suddenly, the chamber fills with floating orbs of light, each containing a moment of future possibility - potential conversations, connections, and shared laughter waiting to happen. My anxiety begins to transform into something different - a kind of electric anticipation that makes the air sparkle with possibility rather than dread.

The dream shifts, and my multiple selves merge back together, now understanding that this anticipatory anxiety is merely a familiar ghost, a shadow puppet making shapes far larger and more threatening than its true form. The crystalline walls pulse one final time, absorbing all the scattered emotions and transforming them into a gentle rainbow that wraps around me like a comforting blanket.

As the dream begins to fade, I'm left with the profound sensation that my anxiety isn't just fear of what might go wrong - it's also the shadow side of excitement for what might go wonderfully right. The chamber dissolves into stardust, leaving behind a lingering feeling of understanding and acceptance of this complex emotional dance.
