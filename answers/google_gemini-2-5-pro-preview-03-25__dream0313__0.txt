I am dreaming. The first thing I realize is the absence of sound. Not the sound of anything specific, but just sound. I can hear myself breathing, but I can’t hear the frantic thumping of my heart. It’s an odd disconnect, like watching a movie with the sound turned off.

I’m standing on a beach, but instead of sand, the ground is made of smooth, gray pebbles. The waves are crashing against the shore, but they’re silent. It’s like watching a pantomime performance. The sky above is a canvas of swirling colors, like an oil slick on water, shifting and changing with every breath I take. The air smells like ozone and petrichor, a strange combination that somehow feels familiar.

A figure approaches me from the water's edge. It's tall and slender, shimmering like a heat haze on a summer road. As it gets closer, I can see its features, but they're constantly changing, morphing from one face to another, like a slideshow of strangers. It stops a few feet away, and although it doesn't speak, I understand its question. It wants to know about my deepest sorrow.

I open my mouth to answer, to tell it about the loss that carved a hole in my heart, the one that aches like a phantom limb. But instead of tears, laughter bubbles up inside me. It starts as a chuckle, then grows into a full-blown guffaw. I'm laughing so hard my sides hurt, tears streaming down my face, but they're tears of mirth, not sadness.

“Well,” I manage between gasps, “there was this one time when my hamster, Sir Reginald Fluffernutter the Third, staged a daring escape. Climbed the water bottle, squeezed through the bars… quite the furry little Houdini. Found him weeks later under the fridge, looking rather… dusty.” I dissolve into another fit of laughter, slapping my knee. “Dusty! Get it? Because he was… well, you know.”

The figure remains silent, its shifting face unreadable. I try to control myself, biting my lip, but the absurdity of the situation, the sheer inappropriateness of my reaction, strikes me as hilarious. “And then there was the funeral!” I wheeze. “We gave him a proper send-off, Viking style. Put him in a little matchbox boat, pushed him out onto the pond… promptly capsized. Soggy hamster burial. Ten out of ten for effort, though!”

The laughter finally subsides, leaving an uncomfortable silence in its wake. The shimmering figure hasn't moved. I look down at the gray pebbles, suddenly aware of the hollowness behind my forced merriment. This isn't me. This isn't how I truly feel. The laughter was a shield, a thick, goofy curtain thrown over the raw wound of actual grief.

I take a deep breath, the ozone-petrichor scent filling my lungs. “That’s… not it,” I whisper, the sound surprisingly loud in the silent landscape. “That’s not the real story.”

I look up at the figure, its face now settling into a vaguely familiar, gentle expression. “The real sorrow… it’s heavier than that. It sits in my chest like one of these stones.” I pick up a smooth, gray pebble, its weight comforting in my palm. “Sometimes, when I try to talk about it, the words get tangled up with jokes. It’s like my brain panics and throws out the nearest available distraction, like a squid squirting ink.”

I trace the smooth surface of the pebble with my thumb. “It’s a defense, I suppose. A way to keep the darkness at bay, or maybe just to make it less scary for others. Easier to laugh about a dusty hamster than the emptiness left by…” My voice trails off. The name hangs unspoken in the air, too sacred, too painful for this strange, silent shore.

The figure tilts its head, a gesture of understanding. It still doesn't speak, but I feel a sense of acknowledgment, a quiet acceptance. The swirling colors in the sky seem to soften, the frantic shifting slows to a gentle pulse.

“It’s exhausting,” I admit, the laughter finally gone, replaced by a profound weariness. “Pretending to be amused by the absurdity of pain. It’s like wearing a clown nose to a funeral. It feels… wrong. Disrespectful to the memory. Disrespectful to myself.”

I drop the pebble, and it lands silently among the others. The figure takes a step back towards the silent waves, its form beginning to blur, becoming less distinct.

“Recognizing it is the first step, right?” I call after it, my voice echoing slightly now, the silence beginning to fray at the edges. “Knowing *why* I do it… maybe that’s how I start to change it.”

The figure dissolves into the shimmering air, leaving me alone on the pebble beach. The silent waves continue their eternal crash and retreat. The sky is still a marvel of shifting color, but now it feels less chaotic, more like a slow, deliberate watercolor painting. The scent of ozone and petrichor lingers.

I stand there for a long moment, feeling the weight of the real sadness, undisguised, unadorned with inappropriate jokes. It’s heavy, yes, but it feels… honest. And in the honesty, there’s a strange sort of peace. The dream begins to fade, the colors softening, the silence starting to fill with the distant hum of waking reality. But the feeling of recognition, the clarity of understanding my own defense mechanism, stays with me, a smooth, gray pebble clutched tightly in my waking mind.Okay, settle in, the edges are blurring, consciousness dipping below the surface...

**I am dreaming.**

The air tastes faintly of copper and dusty velvet. I'm standing in what seems to be an impossibly vast, ornate library. Bookshelves taller than skyscrapers loom on all sides, carved from dark, intricately knotted wood that seems to pulse with a slow, internal light. The ceiling is lost in shadow, perhaps miles above, perhaps non-existent. There's no discernible light source, yet everything glows with a soft, sepia luminescence. The silence here is profound, not empty, but *full* – thick and heavy like poured honey.

I'm not alone. Seated across from me at a ridiculously long, polished obsidian table is... well, it looks like a very old, very tired badger wearing a smoking jacket that's slightly too small for its robust frame. It sips delicately from a tiny porcelain teacup, its claws clicking faintly against the china. Its beady eyes, wise and weary, fix on me.

"So," the badger says, its voice a gravelly rumble like stones shifting underground. "Tell me of the fracture. The moment the world tilted and never quite righted itself."

My breath catches. The air grows colder. I know *exactly* what moment it means. The memory surfaces, sharp and brutal: the phone call in the dead of night, the screech of tires on wet pavement replaying in my mind's ear, the irreversible finality of loss that punched the air from my lungs and left a void that still echoes. It's a raw, ragged wound.

And then, inexplicably, a giggle escapes my lips.

"Fracture?" I snort, leaning forward conspiratorially, trying to suppress a wider grin. "Oh, you mean like that time I tried to assemble that IKEA bookshelf – the 'Björksnäs,' I think? Instructions looked like ancient hieroglyphs deciphered by a squirrel on espresso. Had this one weird screw, see, looked like it belonged on a spaceship." I'm gesturing wildly now, the seriousness of the badger's gaze only fueling the absurdity. "Ended up with three leftover mystery pieces, and the whole thing leaned like the Tower of Pisa after a particularly heavy night. Every time I put a book on it, I'd make bets on which way it'd finally collapse. Talk about a fracture!"

I laugh, a loud, barking sound that bounces strangely off the towering shelves. The badger just stares, its whiskers twitching almost imperceptibly. The teacup remains poised near its snout. The silence resettles, heavier now, pressing in.

My laughter dies in my throat, leaving a metallic taste. Shame washes over me, cold and sticky. *Why did I do that?* That wasn't funny. That wasn't even relevant. The real memory, the painful one the badger prompted, is still there, throbbing beneath the surface like a splinter under the skin. The ridiculous bookshelf story was just… noise. Static thrown up to obscure the signal.

"I do that," I hear myself whisper, the sound unnaturally loud in the honeyed silence. I look down at my hands resting on the cool obsidian table. "When it hurts too much... when the memory is too sharp... the jokes just sort of *happen*. Like a reflex."

The badger sets its teacup down with a quiet *clink*. It doesn't judge, doesn't offer platitudes. It simply waits, its presence solid and ancient.

"It's like," I continue, tracing a non-existent pattern on the table's surface, "my brain throws up this colourful, distracting smokescreen. 'Look over here! Funny anecdote! Ignore the gaping chasm behind the curtain!' It feels... cheap. Disrespectful to the actual pain." I swallow hard. "It's a shield, I suppose. Made of flimsy cardboard and bad puns. Keeps people at arm's length, maybe? Keeps *me* from having to feel the full weight of it, just for a second."

I look up, meeting the badger's steady gaze. "But it's exhausting. And it feels dishonest. Like I'm betraying the memory, somehow, by dressing it up in motley." The vast library seems to press closer, the glowing books humming with silent understanding. The sepia light deepens, becoming warmer, more like acceptance than judgment.

"Recognizing it feels... different," I murmur, a sense of quiet clarity settling within the dreamscape. "Knowing *why* the jester jumps out whenever the king is mourning. It doesn't fix the fracture." I glance towards the shadowed space where the real memory resides. "But maybe... maybe it's the first step towards putting down the cardboard shield and letting the wound actually breathe."

The badger gives a slow, single nod, picks up its teacup again, and takes a thoughtful sip. The silence feels less heavy now, less oppressive. It feels like space. Space to eventually face the fracture without the frantic need to plaster it over with ill-timed humor. The edges of the library begin to soften, the coppery taste fading, as the dream starts to dissolve back into the ether. But the weight of the realization remains, solid and real.
