I am dreaming. I see myself floating in a dark void, surrounded by nothingness.  My senses are blurred and muted, my body is weightless and shapeless.
Suddenly, a bright light appears in the distance, slowly growing larger and brighter until it fills up the entire sky.  It illuminates everything around me,
revealing a beautiful landscape filled with lush green grass, colorful flowers, crystal clear waters, and soaring birds. 
At the center of this paradise is a majestic temple made of gold and diamonds, where I feel drawn towards.  As I approach it, I hear music playing
and smell fragrant scents wafting through the air.
I step inside the temple and find myself in a huge chamber decorated with ornate carvings and intricate patterns.  In front of me is a large altar
surrounded by seven candles burning brightly.  On top of the altar lies a silver box engraved with mysterious symbols.
I walk towards it and lift the lid, revealing a pair of wings folded neatly within.  They are white and pure, shining like diamonds in the sunlight.
I reach out my hand to touch them, feeling their soft texture and light weight.  I close my eyes and imagine myself flying high above the clouds,
soaring freely among the stars.
But then I hear a voice calling me from behind:
"Who are you?  What are you doing here?"
I turn around and see two figures standing at the entrance of the temple.  They are dressed in white robes and hooded masks, their faces hidden
from view.
They approach me slowly, extending their hands towards me.  I feel a sense of dread and uncertainty creeping into my heart. 
"Remove your mask", one of them says to me.
"Why should I?," I ask him back.
"Because we want to see your face.", he replies.
"But why do you care about how I look?", I question him further.
"Because we are curious about who you really are.", he answers simply.
