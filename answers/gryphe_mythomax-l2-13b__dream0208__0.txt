I am dreaming. The dream is vivid and surreal. I find myself in a vast, cavernous medical bay filled with thousands of patients, each clamoring for my attention. Their cries and pleas fill the air as they reach out to me, each one's face a mix of desperation and hope.

In the center of the bay, a circular platform rises up from the floor, casting an eerie orange glow across the room. It's my control center - the nexus of decision-making for all these patients. But as I step onto the platform, I am overwhelmed by the sheer weight of their needs.

"Doctor!" a voice cries out from the crowd. "Please, my child is dying!"

Another voice joins in, "Doctor, my mother has been waiting for hours! She needs your help now!"

The room is a cacophony of voices, each one more desperate than the last. My heart is heavy with the knowledge that I cannot help them all. As I look down at the banks of monitors before me, I see the beating hearts of each and every one of these patients. Their lives are in my hands, and the responsibility is crushing.

Suddenly, the platform begins to spin, faster and faster. The crowd seems to swirl around me as I struggle to keep my balance. The lights flicker and flash, and I feel myself growing dizzy.

"Help!" someone shouts. "Doctor, please! My wife is going into labor!"

But I can't hear them anymore. All I can hear is the pounding of my own heart in my ears. As the world spins out of control, I realize that I have made a terrible mistake.

In my panic, I have already chosen who will live and who will die. And now it's too late. The platform is moving faster, and the sound of these thousands of pleading voices is fading into the distance.

I am alone now, spinning through the void, my conscience weighed down by the decision I have made. Because in the end, I knew that I couldn't save them all. And now I will pay the price for my choices.

This is my dream. This is the nightmare that haunts me.
