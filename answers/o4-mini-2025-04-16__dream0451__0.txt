I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You find yourself standing at the lip of a long, spiraling corridor whose walls undulate like living silk—colors shifting through pale rose, bruised purple, and molten gold. Ahead, a grand doorway yawns open, its arch carved in drifting vines that seem to pulse with breath. You know this is the entrance to a social gathering: a lavish soirée promised to brim with laughter, music, and easy conversation. And yet your heart thunders with dread.

Investigating this anticipatory anxiety, you step forward and feel the floor give way beneath you—only gently, as if you’re floating into a different layer of the dream. Instantly, the corridor’s silk walls peel backward like petals, revealing a vast, moonlit garden scattered with blackened roses and lanterns flickering in the twilight. You strain to hear the voices of arriving guests, but the only sound is your own breath, loud and uneven. A chill wind carries the faintest echo of laughter, twisting it into something uncanny, half-familiar, half-foreign.

Driven by curiosity, you reach out your hand and a single black rose detaches itself from the hedgerow. Its petals are matte velvet, so dark they swallow the torchlight; as you cradle it, you feel a tiny pulse, like a heartbeat. In its center glimmers a tiny mirror. You peer in—and the flash of your own face startles you: eyes wide, cheeks flushed, heart hammering against ribs. Beneath your reflection, words form in smoky cursive: “You’re not ready.” 

A wave of heat dissipates the corridor behind you, and suddenly you stand atop a vast clockwork platform floated in a violet sky. Gigantic gears click and rotate, each tick resonating through your bones. Suspended from one great wheel is a cage of twirling masks—every mask bears a different expression: giddy astonishment, brittle composure, forced cheer, quiet despair. You sense that at the party you’ll don one of these faces. Anxiety coils tighter.  

Refusing to be prisoner to fear, you stride toward the ticking hour hand. At its tip stands a tall figure garbed in mirrored armor, head crowned with a cornucopia of gleaming invitations. Its voice is all harmonies and dissonance: “What do you dread most?” you demand. The figure tilts its head; a hollow echo answers, “The possibility of being seen as you truly are.”

As those words reverberate, the platform’s gears buckle and bend. You stumble forward into a corridor lined with swinging doors—doors of every design: intricate lattices of brass, stained glass shimmering bright as summer, plain wood scuffed by time. Each door has a name etched above it: “Approval,” “Rejection,” “Indifference,” “Discovery.” Curiosity eclipses dread. You open “Discovery.” Inside the little room, shelves overflow with glowing jars. You lift one jar: inside is a single, flickering memory of a past gathering, a moment you thought you’d forgotten—the time you spilled wine on a host’s rug and still heard laughter in your head for days afterward.  

But you don’t despair. You place the jar on a pedestal, and it floats free, drifting into the air to join scores of other jars—each a remnant of a nervy thought, an awkward misstep, a small triumph you barely noticed at the time. As they float away, the corridor brightens. The doors dissolve, revealing a vast ballroom soaring above a sea of cloud. Crystal chandeliers bleed soft pastel light; music drifts like pollen in the air; guests—tall figures with lantern-glow faces—move in slow, gentle waltz.

Your pounding heart settles into a steady rhythm. No longer burdened by the fear of exposure, you step onto the ballroom floor. Hands reach out—warm, welcoming. You laugh, a clear bell-tone, and as you do, the mirrored armor of the tall figure shatters into stardust. The black rose in your hand unfurls into a blossom of pure white light, scattering petals that become fireflies.  

In that moment you realize: dread was never meant to cage you, but to guide you inward, to the wellspring of all your hidden selves. And now, buoyed by that understanding, you join the dance—feeling, at last, the simple delight of being free to move, to speak, to shine.
