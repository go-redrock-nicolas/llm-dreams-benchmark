I am dreaming. …stand on the rim of a sky-wide chasm, its edges glowing like the ember-red pages of a sacred book held too close to the fire. Far below, clouds churn in slow motion, swirled milk in black coffee, and somewhere beneath that roiling blanket beats the engine of everything you’ve ever fought for. 

Behind you, the road of your struggles winds back through the dream’s impossible geography: jagged steps carved from obsidian memories; rivers that carried whispers instead of water; nights so cold that even your thoughts crystallized and tinkled to the ground. On that road lie the trophies you earned—each one a testament to exhaustion: a cracked compass that always pointed toward hope, a lantern whose light was made of your laughter, a single feather from the bird that once guarded your fears. All precious, but none so precious as what you hold now.

Cradled to your chest is a small sphere, no larger than a grape, yet inside burns a miniature aurora: flickers of childhood mornings, the scent of cedar in your first secret hideout, the echo of a friend’s shout when they first called you brave. This is your Core Memory, the living spark that lets you remember why any of it mattered. And now the chasm demands it.

A voice—neither thunderous nor gentle, but as inevitable as gravity—rises from the abyss: “The bridge will appear only when the light is cast away. Trade the seed of your self, and the path will finish forming.” You glance down; an unfinished bridge of translucent crystal juts out from the cliff like a broken promise, halting a single step shy of the mid-air crossing. Tiny shards flake off its tip, drifting downward like dying snow.

Your heart riots. You feel the sphere’s warmth soaking into your palm, pulsing with each beat inside your chest. If you release it, you fear you’ll awake hollow, a beautiful façade with no history beneath it. If you keep it, the dream offers nothing but endless waiting—eternal stalemate on the brink of everything you worked for. 

Wind hurtles across the gap, carrying scents like pages in a storybook: rain on summer dirt, cinnamon bread cooling in some half-remembered kitchen, ozone after fireworks. Each perfume is a coaxing hand on your shoulder, urging you forward, reminding you of why you took the first step years—or minutes—ago. 

You look again at the sphere. Its swirling lights resolve into faces: the mentor who believed in you, the rival who sharpened you, the loved one whose smile was a vow of tomorrow. Letting go would mean dissolving that constellation forever. Yet something inside you whispers: “Stars still exist even when unseen.”

Tears, warm and shimmering, blur the edges of the world until the chasm seems to waver like a painting on water. With a final inhale you feel the sphere’s warmth migrate through your blood, mapping every vein with molten sunrise. Then you extend your hand over the abyss.

For a heartbeat the world falls silent; then, you release.

The sphere drifts downward, trailing ribbons of iridescent vapor that curve upward into the form of wings. They beat once—twice—and shatter into a million fireflies that scatter across the night beneath you. Where each firefly lands, a new shard of crystal erupts from the void, slotting into place. In breaths too quick to count, the bridge completes itself, glowing with borrowed starlight.

But something else has changed: though you feel a cavity where the Core Memory once rested, new space has opened for possibilities unimagined. Your heartbeat quiets, not from emptiness but from spaciousness—a cathedral inside your ribcage ready to echo with future laughter, future grief, future wonder.

You step onto the finished bridge. Each footfall releases a low, bell-like hum that harmonizes with the sigh of the wind. Halfway across, you pause and look back. The trophies, the road, even the cliff itself have begun fading to watercolor, as though they had only ever been sketches on a waking mind. Ahead, however, the path sharpens into impossible clarity—vivid greens, electric ceruleans, colors without names preparing to baptize your vision.

As you take the final step, the dream’s last boundary dissolves. You do not fall. You do not soar. Instead, you become motion itself—an arrow loosed from every former doubt. And with that you wake, not empty-handed, but light-hearted, the sacrifice transmuted into unclaimed futures waiting to be written in the daylight that now pours through your window like a vow.
