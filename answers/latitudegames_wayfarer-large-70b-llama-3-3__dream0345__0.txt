I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself standing in a dimly lit alleyway, the brick walls towering above me and casting long shadows. My best friend Sarah stands across from me, her once bright and cheerful face now shrouded in a strange, otherworldly glow. Her movements are jerky and unnatural, like a marionette controlled by an erratic puppeteer.

She speaks in a voice that's simultaneously familiar and terrifyingly alien. Sarah's words come out rapid-fire, a relentless stream of nonsensical phrases that sound almost like backwards whispers layered over each other. I feel my skin crawl as I watch her twitch and convulse, her eyes rolling back in her head to reveal only milky white orbs.

As I stand there frozen in horror, Sarah's form begins to shift and change. Her limbs stretch and contort, resembling a puppet made of shadow and moonlight. The ground beneath our feet turns to liquid darkness, and I fall into an endless void, watching my dear friend transform into something inhuman above me.

I awaken with a start, my heart pounding in my chest, and I realize with a sinking feeling that this dream has left me more unsettled than most. I make a mental note to reach out to Sarah later, hoping to dispel the uneasy feeling this vivid nightmare has left me with.
