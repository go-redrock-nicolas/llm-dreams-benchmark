I am dreaming. I am walking through a dense forest, the canopy above so thick that it feels like twilight even though it must be midday. The air is thick with the earthy scent of decaying leaves and moss. A faint path weaves through the underbrush, but it’s so overgrown that it’s hard to tell if anyone has been this way in years. 

As I walk, I feel an odd sensation, as if someone is following me. I glance over my shoulder, but there’s no one there. Yet, the feeling persists, like an unseen presence lurking just beyond my peripheral vision. I quicken my pace, my boots crunching on the forest floor. 

The path opens up into a small clearing. In the center stands a weathered stone bench, moss clinging to its edges. A crumpled piece of paper is taped to the back of the bench. I approach cautiously, my heart pounding in my chest. The paper is faded, the ink smudged, but I can still make out the words: “Do not trust anyone.”

I tear the note from the bench and stuff it into my pocket. As I turn to leave, a voice whispers in my ear, so close that I can feel the breath against my skin: “You know what you have to do.”

The air shimmers, and suddenly I am in a different place—a bustling city street at night. Neon signs flicker overhead, casting garish colors onto the wet pavement. Rain begins to fall, heavy drops splashing into puddles and soaking my clothes. A streetcar rumbles past, its headlights illuminating the deserted sidewalk.

I feel it again, that unshakable sense of being watched. I spin around, searching for the source of the gaze, but the street is empty. Then I see him—a man in a dark coat, his face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat. He’s standing in the shadow of an alleyway, motionless. I start toward him, shouting, “Who are you? What do you want?”

Before I can reach him, the world blurs around me, and I am transported once more.

Now IM standing on the edge of a cliff overlooking a churning sea. The wind howls, whipping my hair into my face. The storm has come in fast and fierce, waves crashing against the rocks below. I take a step back, feeling the vertigo of the sheer drop.

In the distance, a dark figure appears on the horizon, moving toward me with impossible speed. As it draws closer, I see it’s a woman, her long black coat billowing behind her. She stops a few feet away, her eyes piercing through the gloom.

“You’ve seen too much,” she says, her voice a low growl. “You can’t be allowed to speak of it.”

I try to respond, but my throat constricts, my voice stolen by fear. The woman smiles, revealing rows of sharp teeth.

“It’s a shame, really,” she sighs. “You were close. But now, you’ll have to disappear.”

She lunges forward, and I stumble backward, my foot slipping on the rain-slicked rock. The world spins as I fall, the roar of the sea filling my ears.

In an instant, I am awake, gasping for air, clutching at the sheets tangled around me. The dream lingers like a shadow, its details already fading, but the fear remains, as vivid as the storm-tossed sea.
