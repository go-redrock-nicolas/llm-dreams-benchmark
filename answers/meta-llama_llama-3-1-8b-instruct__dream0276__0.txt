I am dreaming. The world around me is a kaleidoscope of colors, with vibrant hues that dance in the air like wisps of mist. I feel myself floating on a cloud, weightless and free, with no sense of time or space to bind me. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the sound of gentle music drifts in and out of my awareness, like a soothing melody that plays on the strings of my heart.

As I drift through this dreamworld, I notice a peculiar phenomenon. Small rewards that once seemed insignificant to me now have a profound impact on my motivation. A simple smile from a stranger brightens my path, and a modest gesture of kindness encourages me to keep moving forward. The way a ray of sunlight breaks through the clouds and illuminates a fleeting moment stirs within me a deep sense of wonder.

I ponder the reasons behind this shift in my motivation patterns. Have I become more sensitive to the world around me? Have I begun to appreciate the nuances of everyday experiences? The reflection reveals a profound truth: that even the smallest acts of kindness can be the catalyst for a profound awakening within us.

As I wander through this dream, I stumble upon a hidden garden, tucked away in the recesses of my subconscious. The garden is a tapestry of vibrant colors, with flowers that bloom in every shade of the rainbow. Each bloom represents a special moment, where a small reward had ignited within me a sense of inspiration and drive. The garden grows and evolves with every new experience, like a living, breathing entity that embodies the power of small rewards.

In this kaleidoscope of color and sound, I begin to grasp the intricate web of motivations that engage me. The world is full of tiny rewards, hidden in the folds of everyday life. And as I acknowledge and appreciate these small joys, the entire dreamworld around me transforms into a vibrant tapestry of wonder and magic.

As I step into this magical realm, I feel a boundless openness to experience, untethered from the minutiae of my waking concerns. Free to explore the expansive landscape of my subconscious, I dive into the depths of my imagination, with an insatiable curiosity and a willingness to explore the infinite possibilities that underlie the apparently insignificant details of my dreams.

I leave the garden of small rewards, knowing that I have been returned a piece of myself - the dynamic force that propels me forward, the uncloying desire to seek out and participating small delights of the world around. I remain right at the heart of this dream, knowing I have unlocked the dreamsolute desire and has given direction to the cup that disposessed me.
