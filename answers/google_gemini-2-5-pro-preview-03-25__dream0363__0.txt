I am dreaming. The dream started as a picturesque scene, a sun-drenched meadow where wildflowers swayed in a gentle breeze. Laughter echoed around me, carefree and light, belonging to figures I recognized but couldn't quite place. It felt idyllic, a perfect escape, yet a subtle tension thrummed beneath the surface, like a discordant note in a beautiful melody. I walked through the tall grass, the blades cool against my skin, trying to pinpoint the source of this underlying unease.

Suddenly, the sky darkened, the vibrant colors leaching away as if drained by an unseen force. The laughter morphed into strained whispers, the figures turning away, their faces obscured by shifting shadows. The gentle breeze became a biting wind, whipping the wildflowers into a frenzy. The meadow, once welcoming, now felt accusatory, closing in.

It was then that the dam broke. The suppressed anger I hadn't even fully acknowledged surged forth, a volcanic eruption of raw emotion. It wasn't a quiet simmer; it was a roaring inferno. The ground beneath my feet cracked, mirroring the fracturing of my composure. Molten resentment bubbled up from the fissures, glowing with an intensity that scorched the air.

The landscape warped and twisted around this emotional epicenter. The wildflowers withered into ash, the trees contorted into gnarled, skeletal shapes. The sky churned with storm clouds that pulsed with a furious, inner light. My own voice, unfamiliar and amplified, roared across the desolate scene, articulating grievances I hadn't dared to voice in waking life. Each shout sent shockwaves through the dream world, shattering the remnants of the peaceful meadow.

This wasn't just anger; it was a catharsis, powerful and terrifying. It felt like a physical force emanating from my core, reshaping the very fabric of the dream. There was a strange sense of liberation in this unbridled expression, a release from the pressure that had been building silently within.

Handling this eruption wasn't about suppression or control, but about witnessing its power. I stood amidst the tempest, not consumed by it, but observing its raw, untamed energy. There was a peculiar clarity in the chaos. I saw the roots of the anger, the specific injustices and frustrations that had simmered beneath the surface, now laid bare in the dramatic display.

Slowly, as the initial fury began to subside, the molten fissures cooled, leaving behind veins of obsidian-like glass crisscrossing the broken ground. The storm clouds didn't dissipate entirely but softened, their inner light dimming to a pulsating glow, like embers after a fire. The roaring wind gentled into a mournful sigh, rustling through the skeletal trees.

The anger hadn't vanished, but it had transformed. It was no longer a destructive force threatening to tear me apart, but a landscape reshaped by its passage. There was a stark beauty in the aftermath, a testament to the intensity of the emotion that had been unleashed. Standing there, amidst the wreckage of the idyllic meadow, I felt a sense of weary understanding. The eruption had been necessary, a violent but ultimately cleansing storm that had revealed the hidden depths of my own emotional terrain. The dream lingered, not as a nightmare, but as a profound and resonant echo of an unveiled truth.Okay, sinking deeper... the edges of wakefulness fray...

**(You are dreaming.)**

The scene materializes not gradually, but *instantly*, as if I've been dropped into the middle of Act II. I'm standing in an immense, echoing library. Towering shelves carved from dark, almost black wood soar upwards into perpetual gloom; I can't see the ceiling, only endless rows of leather-bound books, their gold-leaf titles glinting faintly like trapped stars. The air smells thick with old paper, dust motes dancing dreamily in the few shafts of silvery light piercing the vastness. There's a profound silence here, the kind that presses in on your ears.

I'm not alone. Across a checkerboard marble floor sits a figure at a heavy oak table, engrossed in a massive tome. I recognize them – someone connected to the situation, the *real* situation simmering beneath my waking thoughts. In the dream, their features are softened, almost serene, which feels profoundly *wrong*. They look up, offer a placid, unassuming smile, and murmur something polite, inconsequential. "Lovely quiet, isn't it?"

And that's the spark. That casual dismissal, the sheer *ordinariness* of their presence against the backdrop of my unacknowledged fury—it's like striking a match in a gas-filled room.

The eruption isn't a shout, not at first. It's a physical *force* that slams into the library's oppressive silence. The air **shimmers** with heat, the dust motes igniting like tiny embers. The floor beneath my feet doesn't just tremble, it **cracks**, fissures spreading like black lightning across the marble squares. A sound rips from my throat, raw and guttural, less a word than the tearing of fabric.

The serene figure flinches, their placid expression shattering like porcelain. The heavy oak table **splinters**, books flying off its surface as if detonated from within. The towering shelves groan, leaning precariously, and spines of ancient books begin to **rain down** around us, hitting the floor with heavy, accusatory thuds.

My anger isn't just sound; it's visible energy. It pulses outwards from me in waves of distorted color – sickly greens, bruised purples, searing oranges – warping the air, making the towering shelves bend and sway like trees in a hurricane. The silvery shafts of light turn blood-red, illuminating the chaos with a terrifying glare. My own hands feel impossibly hot, vibrating with the force pouring through me. Words finally come, not spoken but **hurled**, each syllable a projectile aimed at the cowering figure, articulating every buried resentment, every perceived slight, every drop of frustration I'd meticulously bottled up. They echo unnaturally in the vast space, multiplying, bouncing off the unseen ceiling, creating a deafening chorus of my own rage.

Now, the *handling*. Amidst this maelstrom, a strange detachment settles over a part of my dream-self. It's like watching a volcano erupt from a safe distance, even while standing right at its fiery mouth. I *am* the source of this destructive Llibrary storm, yet I can also *observe* it.

Instead of being consumed, I feel the intense power, the sheer *volume* of the emotion, and there's a bizarre sense of validation in its destructive honesty. The pressure is gone, vented in this spectacular, impossible display. I watch the figure across the wreckage, their fear palpable, and feel not satisfaction, but a stark, aching clarity. *This* is what I'd been holding inside. *This* is its shape, its color, its sound.

The downpour of books lessens. The violent pulsing of color softens, though the air remains thick and charged. The cracks in the floor smolder rather than blaze. My voice lowers, not out of exhaustion, but because the primary force has been spent. The echo fades, leaving a ringing silence heavier than before.

Handling it, here in the dream, isn't about apology or suppression. It's about acknowledging the landscape sculpted by the eruption. I take a deep breath, tasting the acrid air, the scent of burnt paper and ozone replacing the dusty sweetness. I look at the devastation – the splintered furniture, the wounded shelves, the scattered pages like fallen leaves after a storm – and recognize it as a physical manifestation of my inner state.

There's no attempt to fix it, not yet. The dream logic dictates that the important part was the *release*, the witnessing of its power. I stand there, breathing amidst the beautiful, terrifying ruin of the silent library, feeling strangely lighter, the ghost of the roaring heat still tingling on my skin. The anger hasn't vanished, but it has been *expressed*, given form and fury, and in its aftermath, there's a quiet understanding settling in the charged air. The silence returns, but it's different now – no longer oppressive, but contemplative, holding the echo of the storm.
