I am dreaming. I am standing at the edge of a crystalline forest, where every tree seems to be made entirely of liquid light.  The air is filled with the scent of blooming elderflowers and the distant sound of a lute that plays a melody that feels like home.  But as I step forward, the ground ripples like water, and a voice inside me hisses, "You missed the first step.  Look at your feet."

This voice is my inner critic, a gnarled old ogress with scales that shimmer like tarnished silver.  She wears a crown of broken thorns and carries a whip with barbs of my own insecurity.  "You forgot to bow to the elder tree first," she snarls, as the forest seems to dim slightly, as if disappointed.  I can feel her words like frost on my skin.  But then, a small flame appears in my palm.  It's not mine—it's a spark from the forest itself, a gift from the trees who know the ogress hasn't always been this way.  "She was once a young deer," whispers the wind, "who learned to run by falling, and then blaming herself."

I offer the flame to the ogress.  She recoils, then studies it with a flicker of curiosity.  "You think a spark will save you?" she rasps.  I don't answer.  Instead, I let the flame dance on my shoulder, where it begins to warm the thorns of her crown.  "It's not the mistakes," I say softly, "but how we carry them that matters."  The ogress trembles slightly.  From the shadows, a figure emerges—a younger version of her, a deer with antlers made of unbroken branches.  "Remember?"The ogress inhales sharply, the flame flickering in the hollows of her throat like a trapped star.  Around us, the forest stirs—elderflower petals unfurling midair to form a bridge, liquid light pooling at our feet to mirror the constellations.  The younger deer-her steps forward, antlers touching the ogress’s crown where thorns snap and reform into softer ivy.  *“You were a once,”* it murmurs, voice a wind chime of birch and rain.  *“They told you mistakes were cracks that let the dark in. But look—”*  It tilts its head, and through the ogress’s pained eyes, I see:  The first fire I kindled as a child, my hands blistered but holding warmth.  The song I stumbled through, notes tangling but beat true in time.  The way a million "flaws" have woven into a constellation only I could name.

The ogress’s whip drops to the ground, rustling like autumn leaves.  *“You’re not fixing me,”* I tell her, not gently.  The flame on my shoulder blazes, and from its heart blooms a lute—not the one from before, but one carved from living wood, strings that pulse with laughter.  *“You’re reminding me.”*  She reaches out, scales dissolving into deer fur, and together we play.  The notes are clumsy, the rhythm off-key, but the forest crescendos—rocks rise to drum, rivers hum basslines, and that voice, that *critical* voice, dissolves into the chords.  It becomes a chorus now, not a critic.  A reminder that the song exists not in perfection, but in the courage to keep strumming, even when the forest whispers, *“Try again.”*  

I wake damp with dew, fingers brushing an imaginary flame.  Outside, real dawn breaks—grey and patient.  No ogress, no crown, just a universe that hums:  *Mistakes are not cracks. They are the places the light gets in.*
