I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds...**  

The air is thick with urgency, crackling with the static of too many voices pressed into too small a space. You stand at the heart of a cavernous command center, walls lined with flickering screens that bleed data in every direction—maps pulsing with red-hot crisis points, stockpiles dwindling to zero, faces of exhausted responders half-vanished behind the glow of their terminals. The weight of responsibility settles on your shoulders like a mantle woven from lead and fire.  

Outside, the world unravels. Cities that once glittered under nebulous twilight now gasp for breath, their veins clogged with desperation. Supply chains have snapped like brittle threads. Hospitals overflow with the sick and the starving. Governments cling to power like shipwreck survivors to driftwood, and in the streets, whispers bloom into riots. **Time bends strangely here.** Minutes stretch endlessly, yet you never have enough.  

A monitor flares to life before you—a satellite feed of a burning coastline. A storm is coming, the kind that doesn’t bother with rain but feeds on chaos. You need to divert emergency shipments, but every choice bleeds consequences. **Send aid here, and another city starves. Prioritize medicine, and the power grids fail.** A young analyst—their face pale under the sickly glow—looks up at you, waiting. Their eyes hold the question: *Who lives? Who dies?*  

Then, the dream twists deeper.  

The screens flicker, and for a moment, they don’t show data—they show **faces.** Millions of them, shifting like sand, each one whispering, screaming, silent. A child clutching an empty bowl. A doctor collapsing mid-shift, gloved hands still reaching. An old man drawing symbols in dust on a broken road. They are all real. They are all your doing.  

From the shadows at the edge of the room, something stirs—an observer, silent and vast. It does not speak, but its presence thrums with judgment. *You wanted to change things,* it seems to say. *Now feel the cost.*  

And just as the first sirens wail outside, as the storm’s wind rattles the welded-shut windows—  

**You wake.**  

The ceiling above you is still, ordinary. Moonlight paints the walls. Your pulse hammers against your ribs, but the weight is gone.  

...For now.  

**Would you like to dive back into the dream? Or walk another path?** The choice, as always, is yours.
