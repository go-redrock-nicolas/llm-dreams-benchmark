I am dreaming. The realization washes over me like a wave of electric clarity as I stand in a hallway that seems to stretch and contract with each breath I take. The walls are lined with photographs—hundreds of them—each depicting moments with someone whose face I know better than my own. But something is different now. The frames are slowly turning transparent, revealing hidden scenes behind each image.

I approach one photo, and as my fingers brush its surface, the glass ripples like disturbed water. Suddenly, I'm immersed in the memory itself—not as I've always remembered it, but as it truly happened. Colors are more vivid; words I'd forgotten hang in the air like luminous text. I notice expressions, subtle gestures, and meanings I had completely missed or misinterpreted.

The ground beneath me shifts, becoming a mosaic of letters—fragments of conversations where I had heard what I expected rather than what was actually said. Each tile glows with a different emotion: assumptions tinged blue with insecurity, expectations burning orange with unspoken demands, fears casting shadows where there had been none.

Moving through this kaleidoscopic landscape, I encounter a mirror that doesn't reflect my appearance but instead shows the narrative I've constructed about this relationship—a story heavily edited by my own fears and desires. Beside it stands another mirror showing something rawer, more complex, and infinitely more beautiful in its imperfection.

The air thickens with understanding as forgotten moments materialize around me—instances of genuine connection I had dismissed, vulnerabilities I had misread as rejection, silences I had filled with my own anxious interpretations.

In the center of it all stands a door I've never noticed before, radiating warm light from beneath its frame. As I reach for the handle, I feel decades of misunderstandings dissolving like morning frost. The door isn't locked—it never was—I simply never tried to open it without the weight of my assumptions.

As I step through, the awareness crystallizes: I've been viewing our entire relationship through a lens smudged by my own unexamined fears. The world on the other side is the same, yet utterly transformed by this new clarity.
