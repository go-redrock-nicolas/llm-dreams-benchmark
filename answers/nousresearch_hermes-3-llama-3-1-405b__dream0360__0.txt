I am dreaming. The air shimmers with each breath I take, throwing the world into sharp focus as if to compensate for the fact that none of it is real.

I wander through the now-familiar halls of an ancient castle, rendered in breathtaking detail by the unfettered creativity of my subconscious mind.  Tweaks of conscience, long suppressed, render the world rich as oil paints as I pass.

I enter an elegant ballroom, caught in a swirl of silk and perfume from another era. Dancers twirl past me in a choreographed waltz, their spinning figures casting long shadows on the walls.

Across the room, I see you, just as I have a hundred times before, in a hundred different rooms. Our eyes meet, but we do not speak - our drama needs no words, and besides, I know this dance too well.

With a dip of your head, we begin our minuet - one step forward, two steps back, always something to keep us apart. It is a dance as familiar as your breath on my cheek, as painful as the knife you twist in my gut.

Anger flares, accompanied by violins. The music swells. Perhaps - perhaps - this time, things will be different. Perhaps I will be able to break free from the chains that bind me to this endless cycle of you and me.

But as I look closer, I see the truth. Behind your eyes, green as bottle glass, twitches the reflection of someone else - the person I am with now, the one who holds me when I dream dreams like this.

You are not them, will never be them - and yet, each time we fight, each time we speak, I catch echoes of a past gone by, as if there is a thin veil between what was and what is, and I can't help but see one through the other, can't help but treat this new love as if they might hurt me like you did.

With a rush of clarity, I see the unfairness of it all - and I also see the way forward.

Slowly, and with great effort, I pry my gaze from yours. As our eyes unlock, I feel your pull weaken, your siren call grow fainter. You do not fade - but I turn my back, secure in the knowledge that I am walking away from you, and toward something new.
