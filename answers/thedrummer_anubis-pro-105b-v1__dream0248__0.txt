I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a vast, serene landscape, painted with hues of cerulean and amethyst that dance across the horizon. The warm, golden sun casts a gentle glow across the rolling hills, illuminating tiny, delicate flowers that sway in the soft breeze. The air is filled with the sweet, intoxicating scent of honeysuckle and the distant chirping of birds, creating a sense of serenity and peace.

As I wander through this idyllic scape, I come upon a figure in the distance, huddled on a rock, their body shaking with profound sobs. They tug at their hair and their distress is palpable, even from afar. As I progress closer, the aching in their voice becomes clearer, as they cry for help, for comfort, for someone to ease their pain.

I stop before them, watching them with clarity. But there is something within me that remains unmoved by this heartbreaking scene.

I realize, with a strange sense of detachment, that I feel nothing for this wounded soul. I am an impassive witness to their anguish, my heart unmoved and my mind untouched by the depth of their sorrow. For a moment, I feel a flicker of unease, a twinge of recognition that something is not quite right within me; that I am now devoid of love for someone who is so very much in pain. But then that spark of uncertainty is extinguished by my unshakeable apathy. 

I turn and walk away, my footsteps quiet on the lush, green grass, and I feel nothing for the despairing figure that begins to wail even louder. I continue on, lost in my cold and emotionless dreams.
