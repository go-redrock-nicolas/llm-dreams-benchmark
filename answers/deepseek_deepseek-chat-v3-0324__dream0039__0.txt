I am dreaming. A dream so vivid, so intoxicating, that the air itself hums with unseen energy.  

The sky above is a swirling canvas of liquid gold and deep violet, like oil and water stirred by an invisible hand. Twin suns—one a pulsing ember, the other a cool, electric blue—cast overlapping shadows that stretch and twist as they move. The ground beneath my feet is not rock or soil, but something alive—a spongy, bioluminescent moss that pulses faintly with each step, as if breathing.  

The air is thick, syrupy, and carries a metallic tang, like ozone after a storm. It clings to my skin, making every movement feel deliberate, slow. Gravity here is lighter—or perhaps heavier in strange, unpredictable pockets. One moment, I leap effortlessly, soaring over jagged crystal formations that grow like frozen lightning from the ground. The next, an unseen force presses down, forcing me to my knees as if the planet itself is testing my will.  

Strange flora surrounds me—towering, glass-like trees that chime like wind chimes when the breeze (if it *is* a breeze) passes through them. Their leaves are translucent, refracting the light into prismatic shards that dance across the ground. Somewhere in the distance, a low, resonant hum thrums through the air, a sound that isn’t heard so much as *felt*, vibrating in my bones.  

To survive here, I must adapt.  

The moss beneath me reacts to touch—when I press my palm against it, it glows brighter, warming my skin. Perhaps it can provide sustenance, or even a way to navigate. The trees’ chimes seem to shift in pitch when danger is near—a warning system? I move cautiously, listening, feeling, learning.  

Then, I see *them*—shapes in the distance, tall and slender, their forms shifting like liquid shadow. Natives? Or mere figments of this world’s dream? They do not approach, but their presence is undeniable, watching, waiting.  

The dream deepens. The planet breathes with me. And I realize—I am not just a visitor here.  

I am becoming part of it.
