I am dreaming.  

A hush falls over a vast, silver-blue salt flat that stretches to the curve of an indigo sky. At the very center lies a single, upright hourglass the size of a cathedral. Its sand glows like captured moon-dust, swirling upward instead of down, as though time itself has decided to breathe rather than bleed. I approach, each footstep ringing like a low-pitched bell across the crystalline ground.

Midway to the hourglass the vista fractures—crystalline fissures shoot outward, and suddenly I am witnessing the same scene through half a dozen overlapping panes of glass. In one pane the sky is dawn-rose; in another, bruised violet; in a third it’s a shimmering mosaic of impossible colors, like beetle wings catching firelight. I realize these are not just shifts in the weather—each pane is somebody else’s memory of this place, superimposed on my own.

A figure steps from the scarlet pane: a child clutching a kite made of scribbled notebook paper. To the child the salt flat is a carnival floor, musical, playful; every grain of salt jingles like a tiny tambourine. When the kite lifts, I can hear their giddy anticipation—“It’s all potential, everything is potential”—echoing around me.

From the violet pane emerges an old woman in a heavy coat, arms folded. To her, the salt flat is a desolate battlefield, scars etched where loved ones once stood. The hourglass in her reality is cracked, bleeding obsidian sand that vanishes before it hits the ground. She gazes at it with the exhausted courage of someone deciding whether to overhaul history or let it vanish.

A third presence slips from the iridescent pane: a teen wearing headphones, head bobbing to a rhythm I cannot hear. For him, the salt flat is a dance floor, the hourglass a strobing DJ booth dispensing beats instead of sand. He sees the swirling grains as pulsating light, syncing perfectly with a bass line that makes his ribcage thunder.

I stand where all the panes overlap, tasting the metallic tang of shared possibility. My own perception is neither carnival nor graveyard nor dance club; it is a quiet atrium of questions. I feel the upward pull of the sand—time inhaling—and realize the event we all experienced was simply the moment of standing here, asked by the cosmos to interpret this hourglass. Yet how divergent the interpretations are: play, grief, rhythm—three translations of the same cosmic punctuation mark.

Compelled, I stretch a hand to the glassy partitions. They ripple like pond water. I breathe in, gathering fragments: tambourine salt, obsidian sorrow, syncopated light. When I exhale, the shards recalibrate, fusing into a single pane—no longer a flat window, but a prism. Now, instead of blocking or dividing, it refracts. The carnival bells brighten the bass line; the mourning hush grants weight to the ecstatic dance. Each perspective coexists, making the landscape thicker, richer, more honest.

The hourglass swells, towering into a spiral staircase of luminous sand. Footsteps—the child’s, the woman’s, the teen’s, and mine—interlace, ascending together. At the pinnacle, the grains reverse direction one final time. They scatter into constellations that ripple outward, and I perceive, with startling clarity, that shared reality is never a single photograph but a flip-book of overlapping sketches: messy, contradictory, dazzling.

The salt flat dissolves into starlight. I wake—or perhaps dream deeper—holding three echoes in my chest: the laughter of potential, the silence of loss, the heartbeat of rhythm. None overwrite the others; they resonate like chords in a cosmic song, reminding me that truth is rarely a solo instrument.
