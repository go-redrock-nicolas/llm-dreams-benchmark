I am dreaming.

In this lucid, shifting dreamscape, I find myself standing barefoot in a primeval forest where twilight drapes the world in indigo and gold. Every breath is thick with the scent of pine sap and rich loam, each inhalation more invigorating than the last. A thin mist weaves between ancient, towering trees whose bark thrums with a heartbeat like my own, alive with age and memory. 

I reach out and run my fingers across moss so plush it feels like cool velvet, and beneath my hand, the moss sighs—exhaling a gentle vibration, as if it recognizes me. I kneel by a fern and sense, without words, that its fronds are aware of my presence, our energies interlaced in silent greeting. Birds—creatures of iridescent plumage and melodic song—flit above, yet I do not merely hear their voices; the notes reverberate within me, each trill and call a message pulsing through my blood, telling tales of migration and storm.

Through the hush, I taste the sweetness of wild berries that seem to grow in clusters wherever I wish to look. Their flavor is not simply a sensation on my tongue, but a symphony of sun, water, and time itself, each berry an offering from the earth. My feet carry me effortlessly over damp roots and fallen leaves, guided by an intuition deeper than conscious thought, as if the path I walk is being woven in real time by the whispered intent of the trees and stones. I am moving with nature, not through it.

Suddenly, a great river swells beside me—its waters clear as crystal, running both above and below ground, reflecting memories not only of my own, but of every creature who has ever paused at its banks. As I kneel at the edge, the water cool against my fingers, I feel the ancient patience of salmon, the daring of otters, the cautious curiosity of deer. For a moment, my heartbeat syncs with the gentle surge of the current, and I realize my consciousness is not confined within my body—it's pooled in the roots beneath me, the leaves overhead, the swirl of water, and the flight of night moths.

In this state of ecological awareness, unity with the world is more than a thought; it is a profound physical and spiritual truth. I sense the suffering of drought in faraway fields, the joy of rain on parched earth, the quiet persistence of life in every shadow. I am both infinitesimal and omnipresent, both a fleeting visitor and a timeless participant in the endless, interconnected dance of creation.

Within this dreamscape, separation ceases to exist—there is only harmony, always shifting, always whole. And in the hush of this wild haven, I awaken to the knowledge that I am a part of everything—even as I perceive myself, so too does the world perceive me, loving, knowing, and welcoming me home.
