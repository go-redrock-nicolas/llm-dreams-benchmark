I am dreaming. Swimming through consciousness, I catch a glimpse of my reflection in what seems to be a liquid mirror, rippling with thoughts rather than water. For a heartbeat—or perhaps an eternity—I don't recognize the face staring back. The eyes hold galaxies I've never explored, the smile carries stories I don't remember telling. This disconnect between my mental self-image and physical appearance sends a tremor through the dreamscape.

The reflection begins to shift, features rearranging like puzzle pieces finding new homes. My hair flows upward, defying gravity, becoming intertwined with constellations that weren't there moments before. My skin transitions through seasons—summer freckles bloom and fade into winter pallor, then burst with spring's vitality.

The background behind me transforms into a forest where trees grow books instead of fruit, their pages rustling with forgotten languages. I reach out to touch my reflection, but instead of glass or water, my fingers press against warm clay. I'm sculpting myself anew with each gesture.

Voices echo from somewhere—everywhere—whispers of past conversations mingled with words never spoken. "Remember who you were before they told you who to be," murmurs a voice that might be my grandmother's, or perhaps a future grandchild's.

The boundaries between my body and the world begin to blur. My fingertips dissolve into streams of golden light that connect to every object in this impossible room. I understand suddenly that I've been looking not just at myself but at everything I've ever touched and everyone who has ever touched me.

The mirror-that-is-not-a-mirror pulls back, revealing that I'm standing on the edge of an ancient city built from memories, each building architectured from significant moments of my life. In the distance, mountains breathe slowly, their silhouettes forming the profile of someone I once loved.

I take a step forward, and the ground responds to my intention rather than my weight. This realization—that thought shapes reality here—sends me soaring upward without wings, carried by the simple understanding that boundaries exist only in waking life.
