I am dreaming. My mind feels charged, electric with adrenaline. I'm standing on a circular stage that pulses with a faint azure glow. The edges of the platform ripple like water, yet remain solid beneath my feet. Above me looms a colossal, ever-shifting clockface, its gears made of translucent crystal. Each tick of the clock's hand feels like a heartbeat, resonating through my bones. Around the stage, a crowd of shadowy figures watch silently. Their faces are obscured by masks resembling intricate mechanical birds—some metallic, others glass—and they clutch hourglasses filled with tiny stars. The clock chimes once, then again. The air hums. 

Before me, the problem materializes. It’s a labyrinth of floating equations, glowing symbols, and swirling geometries. They twist like living vines, defying Euclidean laws. The rules flash in my mind: to solve the puzzle, I must navigate this chaos and find the true constant hidden within, something unchanging amidst the flux. The experts around the edges of the stage are already moving, their hands tracing invisible pathways through the air, making the equations snap shut like predatory flowers. 

But I remember the days clenching pens until my knuckles ached, the way my room would fill with the scent of burnt midnight oil. The nights I spent talking to the constellations, convincing myself I belonged here. Now those fragments of study rise like spectral support beams, forming a bridge to understanding. My hands glow faintly as I reach out; equations swirl around them like responsive ink. 

The maze is alive. Beams of light refract off the clock’s crystals, casting prismatic pathways. I press forward, moving not just in space but through layers of time itself—the past where I was a beginner, the future where this arrangement collapses into clarity. 

A star from one of the observers’ hourglasses cascades toward me. I catch it, and its light floods my vision, revealing a pattern in the equations I’ve missed. A Fibonacci spiral woven into a fractal, hidden inside a tessellation. The true constant: not a number, but a rhythm. A pulse in sync with the clock above. 

As I align the last symbol, the crowd murmurs. The clock stops. Time folds. For a breath, I am both novice and prodigy, my path etched into the tapestry of the cosmos. Then the platform dissolves, and I wake—heart drumming, fingertips tingling with starlight.
