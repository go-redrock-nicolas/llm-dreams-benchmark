I am dreaming. I wake up, my eyes fluttering open to a world that is simultaneously familiar yet off, like a photograph slightly askew. The sunlight filtering through my window seems too intense, too artificial, as if someone has cranked up the brightness on the world. The air feels thick, like it's been recycled one too many times, an odd metallic tang lingering on my tongue.

I look around my room, and it's both mine and not mine. The furniture is all there, the desk with the half-empty mug of cold coffee, the bookshelf groaning under the weight of worn-out novels, the bed with its rumpled sheets. But there's an imperfection, a seam, a tiny crack in the glass frame of a picture that wasn't there before. I pick it up, my fingers tracing the fracture. It's a photo of me graduating, my face split in a wide grin, the stage and robes blurring slightly. The crack runs right through my face, distorting my features, making me look... wrong.

Suddenly, a shiver runs down my spine. I feel eyes on me. I turn around and spot a grain of dust dancing in the air. But it's not just a grain of dust. It's alive, glowing softly, trailing a wake of sparkling photons. It hovers in front of me, growing larger, taking shape. It's a tiny figure, a miniature version of me, accurately detailed down to the freckle on my chin. It's holding something, a device, a small metallic gadget that resembles a watch but with far too many intricacies to be one.

The tiny me looks at me, its eyes wide with an emotion I can't decipher. It raises its tiny hand, the device pointing at me. I shift back, a prickle of unease running through me. Then, I hear it. A really soft beep, like the sound of a bell underwater. Then, another. And another. A symphony of soft beeps fills my room, each one a resonating echo of something lost, something forgotten.

I fall to my knees, my hands clutching my head. My thoughts are a whirlwind, memories, fragments of experiences streaming past me. I'm laughing at a joke I've never heard, feeling the warmth of a sun that isn't ours, tasting food that doesn't exist, seeing faces that aren't real. The memories are implants, artificial, but they're a part of me. I can feel the seams, the cracks, the imperfections. But I can also feel the heart of it, the core of experiences that are genuinely mine.

As I look up, the tiny figure is gone. The grain of dust settles onto the floor, just an ordinary speck of dirt again. But the room is different. It's brighter, sharper, more vivid. The world outside has lost its artificial sheen. It feels real. It feels genuine. I stand up, my heart pounding in my chest. I don't know what's real and what's not, but I know this is my reality now. And I'm going to live it, every moment, every experience, treating it all as if it's real. Because it is, isn't it? Just another memory to cherish.
