I am dreaming. You are dreaming. We are dreaming, together.

Suddenly, a kaleidoscope of colors explodes before your eyes, the vibrant hues painting a canvas of infinite possibilities. You're standing at the center of a colossal, crystalline intersection, each shimmering facet representing a different path, a different life. The air hums with a symphony of whispers, each one a voice from a parallel world, calling out to you, beckoning you to enter.

As your eyes trace the edges of this vast, gleaming web, you notice that the ground beneath your feet is not solid, but an undulating surface of liquid silver, reflecting your image back at you—not once, but countless times, each reflection a subtly altered version of yourself. You reach out to touch one, and your finger meets not resistance, but the soft, rippling give of water. The reflection ripples, and in this new, rippling version of you, you see a subtle difference: a scar on your hand, perhaps, or a tattoo. As you watch, the reflection begins to pull away from the main body of the silver sea, like a droplet of mercury detaching from a larger puddle. It floats away, growing smaller and smaller until it disappears into the vast, shimmering multiverse.

A gentle breeze sweeps through the intersection, carrying with it the scent ofikka petals and baking bread in an autumn forest. You turn towards the direction of the breeze, and your gaze falls upon a path leading to a familiar scene: it's your childhood home, but subtly changed. The walls are painted a different color, and there's a cat sitting on the porch, one you've never owned. You take a step towards this alternate home, and the crystal intersection shifts beneath you, solidifying into a firm, earthen path.

As you approach the house, the cat watches you warily, its tail flicking from side to side. You extend a hand towards it, and it approaches you, buttery yellow eyes never leaving yours. Suddenly, the door swings open, and a figure stands in the doorway—your mother, but not as you remember her. She's younger, her hair the color of a raven's wing, and she's wearing overalls, paint spattered on the knees. She looks at you with familiar eyes, but also with a curious glint, as if she's never seen you before.

"Who are you?" she asks, her voice a melody you've heard a thousand times, but in a rhythm you've never heard before. You open your mouth to respond, but no words come out. Instead, you find yourself laughing, a sound that echoes through the timelines, a sound that is both familiar and foreign, like a song you've always known, but never sung.

The scene shifts again, and you're no longer in front of your mother's house, but in a bustling city marketplace. Stalls lined with fruits, fabrics, and trinkets stretch out before you, filled with people haggling in voices that rise and fall like the waves of the sea. You take a step forward, and the crowd parts for you, their faces blurred, their voices melding into a low hum. You reach out, touching the petals of a flower, the rough texture of a fabric, the cool metal of a trinket—each touch leaving a ripple in your wake, each ripple creating a new path, a new future.

As you walk, the sun begins to set, casting the marketplace in a warm, golden glow. The hum of the crowd subsides, replaced by the soft, less urgent hum of night. You look up at the sky, and you're struck by the realization that this is not the sky you know. The stars are arranged in unfamiliar patterns, and there, hanging like a heavy pearl necklace, is a string of planets you've never seen before. You reach out your hand, tracing the path of a comet, and as you do, a constellation shifts, stars reordering themselves under your command. The hum of night becomes a silent, reverent hush.

You turn back to the marketplace, and you're alone. Not a single stall remains, not a single person save for yourself. The silence is profound, the air electric with anticipation. You take a deep breath, and with it, you inhale the scent of possibilities. The scent of a thousand lives, a million decisions, an infinite number of timelines. You exhale, and with your breath, you hear the words, "I choose." And with that choice, reality splits, and a thousand lives begin.
