I am dreaming. I am transported to a mystical land where I am first in line to lead my people into a new land built on values of which I am passionately aligned.  I am filled with a fiery determination to build a society on the foundation of fairness, equality, and respect.

As I stand on the precipice of the new dawn, I take a step forward and leave behind the job which had gradually stifled my spirit.  The conflict between the work required and the deep-rooted values I held dear had sapped my energy and I am now liberated.

As I take each step in my wondrous dream, colors explode around me and I feel the warmth of the sun, the glow of love and the refreshing cool of fairness embrace me. What was once resignation is now courage, reluctance now passion and despair now hope.

The sun is setting on this new land where all my endeavors will be infused with the motivations that burn deeply within me.  In the dark of the night, the challenge of corporate hierarchy is gone, and in its place a bright constellation of STARS ( S - Strength, T - Truth, A - Authenticity, R - Respect, S - Synergy) 

A sense of purpose consumes me as I build a society where the systems and processes, the interactions and relationships, are rooted in the principles that I hold sacred.

The tension I once felt melts away, as I drift off and awaken to a newfound peace in the waking world. As I rub my sleepy eyes, I am ready to embark on a new journey, a new chapter of my life, where my deepest values do not conflict but guide my path.
