I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a library the size of a galaxy, its shelves spiraling into infinity, each book glowing with the faint hum of a forgotten memory. You’re meant to be cataloging them—this is your task, your penance, your purpose—but your hands tremble as they reach for a volume that isn’t there. The air shimmers with the weight of unspoken words, and every time you try to focus, a low, resonant chord thrums through the floorboards, vibrating in your ribs like a half-remembered voice. *Him*. Or her. Or the ghost of a moment that refuses to stay buried.  

You wander instead.  

The library dissolves into a forest of hourglasses, their sands swirling with liquid starlight. Each step you take kicks up moths with wings patterned like old photographs—your childhood dog, a train station at midnight, a hand you once held but can no longer name. The moths flutter into your hair, their dust clinging like guilt. You hear laughter ahead, sharp and sudden, and when you turn, there’s a figure standing at the edge of a cliff made of stacked mirrors. They’re facing away, their silhouette bleeding into the horizon, and when you call out, the wind steals your voice and scatters it into a thousand shards.  

The mirrors show you things:  
A door left ajar.  
A letter unsent.  
A kiss that ended too soon, or perhaps too late.  
You kneel to touch one, and the glass ripples like water. Your reflection isn’t yours—it’s younger, brighter, whole. It smiles bitterly and sinks beneath the surface, leaving you staring at your own hollow eyes.  

You run.  

The forest becomes a city of clocks, gears the size of buildings grinding in arrhythmic protest. People here have no faces, only hourglasses where their hearts should be, their sands pouring upward, defying logic. They ignore you, but you feel their weightless stares, a thousand silent judgments. You duck into an alley where the walls bleed ink, and the words crawl into your ears, whispering *“You never said goodbye”* in a voice you’ve tried to forget.  

Above, the sky fractures like stained glass. A storm of origami birds erupts, each folded from pages of a diary you never kept. They peck at your thoughts, tearing away pieces of resolve until all that’s left is the ache—the *thing* you won’t name. You scream, and the sound crystallizes into a bridge of ice stretching into a void. At its end, the figure from the mirror cliff stands waiting, their outline now familiar, a shadow of someone you loved or lost or invented.  

You step onto the bridge.  

It cracks beneath your feet, but you keep walking, each step a memory: a fight in a rain-soaked street, a promise broken over coffee, a silence too heavy to lift. The figure raises a hand. Their palm holds a single key, rusted and bleeding. *Take it*, they say, though their lips don’t move. *Or leave it. But choose.*  

The ice shatters.  

You fall into a sea of static, the kind that fills old televisions at 3 a.m. The water hisses with static, but beneath it, a melody plays—a lullaby, a dirge, a hymn. You surface gasping, and the dream shifts one last time: you’re back in the library, the book you couldn’t find now open in your hands. Its pages are blank except for one line, written in your own hand:  

*“Some wounds don’t heal. They become lanterns.”*  

You wake with salt on your lips and the echo of wings.
