I am dreaming. I'm standing in the glass-walled conference room of NeuroVerse, the startup I've poured three years of my life into. Rain streams down the windows, distorting the city skyline beyond into wavering ribbons of light. My reflection looks back at me—hair disheveled, dark circles beneath my eyes, the collar of my once-crisp shirt now wilted. The mahogany table stretches before me, surrounded by the anxious faces of my executive team.

"The algorithm failed," whispers Maya, our CTO, her voice barely audible above the storm outside. "The neural interface triggered seizures in three test subjects during the beta trial. The medical board is shutting us down."

The room tilts slightly in my vision. Everything we've built—our revolutionary mind-to-machine interface that promised to help paralyzed patients communicate—is crumbling. My phone buzzes incessantly: reporters, our lead investor pulling out, the class action lawsuit notification.

Through the glass walls, I can see our employees gathered in small clusters, their faces a mosaic of fear and uncertainty. Some are already clearing their desks. The company Slack channel is flooding with messages I can't bear to read.

Just then, the conference room door bursts open. It's Dr. Sato, our neurologist, clutching a tablet with trembling hands. "I found it," he gasps, "a pattern in the data we all missed. The seizures aren't caused by our interface—they're happening because of an interaction with a common migraine medication all three subjects were taking. We can fix this!"

The rain outside intensifies, but a strange golden light begins to filter through the clouds. As Dr. Sato speaks, explaining his discovery, the light grows brighter, more intense. The walls of the office begin to shimmer and dissolve. The faces of my team elongate and blur, their voices echoing as if from very far away.

I reach for Dr. Sato's tablet, but my hand passes through it like mist. The ceiling peels away, revealing not sky but endless spiraling code—ones and zeros rotating in cosmic patterns. I realize I'm not just saving my company; I'm glimpsing something profound about consciousness itself...

And then I'm awake, sheets tangled around me, heart racing, the solution still tantalizingly close but already fading like morning mist.
