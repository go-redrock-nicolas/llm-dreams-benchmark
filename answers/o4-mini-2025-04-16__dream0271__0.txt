I am dreaming. As you approach this moment of potential achievement, the world around you shimmers like heat on a summer highway, folding in and out of focus. Beneath your feet, the marble steps of a grand stairway pulse with warm light, as if each tread contains the heartbeat of every sacrifice you’ve ever made. You feel the smooth stone yielding ever so slightly under your weight, guiding you forward in perfect rhythm. Above you, the sky is no longer sky but a living tapestry of auroras: ribbons of violet, emerald, and molten gold spiral and coil, whispering ancient secrets in a language you almost remember.  

With every step, memories unfurl behind you in a parade of phantom lanterns. You see your younger self hunched over a flickering candle, scribbling equations by hand; you see the faces of mentors whose encouragement glowed brighter than any star; you see the nights you refused sleep, fueled by stubborn hope. Their voices ripple through the air like distant rain: “Keep going,” they murmur, “it’s almost within reach.” A soft breeze carries the scent of pine resin and polished metal—the twin aromas of the forest you fled and the workshop where you forged your dreams.  

Ahead, at the summit of the stairway, stands the Gate of Becoming: two colossal wings of crystal and bronze unfolding from a marble arch. Between them floats your lifelong goal—a small orb of pure white light, pulsing with possibility. You sense its warmth like the sun’s first ray on your face, so close you can almost taste it. Your heart thrums in your chest, and at the very edge of your vision, the wings stir, as though eager to embrace you. The air vibrates with expectancy—every atom around you seems to hold its breath.  

Then, just as you reach out, the dreamscape quivers. The lanterns behind you accelerate into fireflies that dart off into the darkness; the stairway’s pulse slows to a languid heartbeat; the Gate’s wings tilt, casting a brief shadow across the orb. For a heartbeat—an instant—the world stalls. Your fingers hover millimeters from that brilliant core, every nerve alive with longing and fear. And in that charged silence, you realize that this fragile moment is both culmination and beginning: the threshold of everything you’ve been, everything you’ve sacrificed, and everything you have yet to become.  

You inhale, and the dream exhales with you. Just as your fingertips brush the light, the scene dissolves into a cascade of sparkling motes—and you awaken, heart racing, the echo of possibility still vibrating through your veins, carrying you forward into the waking world.
