I am dreaming. …step forward onto a polished marble floor that gleams like moonlight on tranquil water. As you lift your gaze, you see figures in rich indigo robes quietly parting to let you pass—heads bowed in deference. Their faces glow with silent admiration, yet you hardly recognize them. It’s as though the dream itself gathered them out of swirling mist simply to behold you.

Beyond the congregation stands a grand archway carved into an impossibly tall wall of pale ivory stone. Each pillar is etched with mysterious symbols that pulse with a faint azure light. It looks like a gateway from myth, some hidden portal to realms untold. Starlight filters in from above, where the sky shimmers with swirling galaxies instead of mere clouds. The cosmos feels close enough to brush with your fingertips, close enough that you can feel the weight of all its secrets pressing into your chest.

Suddenly, a young figure in a silver mask steps forth from the crowd. Though their features are concealed, you sense their unease, their awe, and their hope directed at you. They ask a question you never expected to hear: “Our purpose hinges on your choice. What shall we do?” The question resonates in the hush, and you feel the entire gathering hold its breath at once. It’s as though even the gentle breezes have stilled, listening. Then you realize: they want your word, your command, to guide them. Each pair of eyes is fixed upon you, unwavering and full of trust.

Yet deep inside, a flutter of uncertainty tugs at your heart. You have never stood in such a position. You glance at the swirling shapes on the pillars, almost expecting them to morph into an answer. But like an unfinished puzzle, the symbols only dance quietly, reflecting your own uncertainty back at you. A hush washes over the dreamscape, heavy with the burden of responsibility—yet also crackling with promise, as though the air itself is charged.

In the midst of this gravity, something shifts within your soul: an ember of confidence sparks. Perhaps the dream’s hush isn’t only a weight; it’s a canvas upon which you can paint your instincts and visions. You take a breath that feels charged with stardust, your eyes steadying on the masked figure. Thoughts begin to crystallize in your mind, forming a plan you sense might guide you, and them, forward. Trembling with both apprehension and excitement, you lift your hands—ready to speak, ready to shine—and the dream holds its breath, waiting for your voice to shape destiny.
