I am dreaming. As I witness the person making a terrible decision, their mouth curving downwards into a shocked expression. Their body language changes, indicating they have just been given the worst news possible. The decision they are about to make is based on incomplete information I possess, crucial knowledge that would change everything. 

At first, I hesitate. I'm not sure if I should intervene, if it's my place to step in and alter the course of events. Parts of me urge me to stay out of it, to let destiny run its path. But then I think about the long-term consequences of the decision. How it might ruin their life, how it could lead to error after error, compounded by the initial choice made with such faulty logic.

But after a split-second, I decide to intervene and tell them the truth. My mouth opens and I speak with as much urgency and honesty I possess, telling I know. I am talking fast, my heart racing with adrenaline, the heat of the moment making me tyrant with eloquence. My voice rises, cracking with emotion as I make arguments as to why the decision they are about to make would be one of grave folly.

My friend looks at me in shock as I tell I know, their body trembling with each word. They squint, trying to decipher if I am lying, trying to gauge the validity of my assertions. Then, as understanding dawns on their face, I see a change come over them. The colour drains from their complexion and they look like they have been punched in the gut.

I halt my words, now just bouncing my lips frenetically, awaiting a response. Have I saved them or just made matters worse? Only time will tell, I reason. But for now, I'll stand by my decision to reveal the truth and pray that they have sense enough to listen to it and take heed.
