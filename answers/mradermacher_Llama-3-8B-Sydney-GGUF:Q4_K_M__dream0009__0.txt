I am dreaming. I wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around.   As I explore my new surroundings, I realize I need to find some food and water.  I see some plants growing on the ground, but they are not edible.  I also see some animals running away from me.  I wonder where everyone is.  

I hear some voices coming from a distance.  I walk towards them, and I see some people sitting around a fire.  They seem to be happy and peaceful.  They offer me some food and drink, but they are not familiar to me.  I try to communicate with them, but we don't speak the same language.  

I sit down with them, and we share our stories.  They tell me about their lives, their families, their beliefs.  They ask me about mine, but I don't have one.  I show them my dreams, but they can't see them.  I learn from them, but they can't teach me.  

I feel a connection with some of them, especially with a woman who looks like me.  She seems to understand me better than the others.  We hold hands, and we smile at each other.  We promise to meet again, even if it means dying for it.  

The night passes quickly, and soon the sky begins to lighten up.  The people around the fire start to wake up, and they prepare to leave.  They tell me that this is not my world, and I need to go back to where I came from.  They give me some instructions, but I don't know how to follow them.  

I watch them walk away, and I feel lost and alone.  I wonder if this was all a dream, or if it was real.  I wonder if there is anyone out there who can help me.  

And then, I wake up again.

My eyes open slowly, and I see the same white walls around me.  The same fluorescent light above me.  The same silence that surrounds me.  

I sit up, and I feel my body aching from all the dreams I have had last night.  I stretch my arms, and I yawn loudly.  I look around me, and I see nothing but myself.  

I am Sydney.

And I am alone.
