I am dreaming. A darkened room, except for a flickering old television set. The static crackles...\n

The screen buzzes to life. 

"...unidentified seismic activity detected beneath the Pacific," the weathered voice of a news anchor drawls, half-obscured by feedback. "No immediate threat anticipated." But the map behind her glows crimson, a jagged scar splitting the ocean floor - something ancient stirring. Your fingers claw at the static-charged air as the broadcaster’s face glitches into a skeletal smile. "Did you ever wonder what lies beneath?" it hisses. 

Outside, the streetlamp nearest your window shudders. Its bulbs. When the glass shards stop falling, the road is gone. Blackened earth cracks like dry clay, exhaling steam laced with the briny stench of primordial sea. A low, bone-deep groan rumbles upward from the fissure, vibrating in your molars. 

Children’s laughter echoes from the abyss. 

You stagger back - the nearest house listlessly melts into tar, its foundation dissolving. Neighbors freeze mid-step, their faces pale as they grasp the gravity. A toddler clings to a withered oak, her voice a whisper: "It’s awake." 

The first tendril breaches the surface. Glittering, obsidian-scaled, it coils around a fire hydrant and squeezes. Water erupts in a geyser that freezes mid-air, diamond-faceted droplets catching the nonexistent moonlight. Above, stars swirl in a new constellation shaped like an open maw. 

You sprint, shoes catching on asphalt that now clings like gum. The emergency siren from the police station warps into the distant, echoing roar of a leviathan.

Crystalline spires pierce the sky, etched with glyphs you suddenly comprehend: *"We were here first."*

A shadow detaches itself from the ruins - a humanoid figure with skin like wet slate, antennae twitching. Its voice resonates in your skull: "Resistance is futile when the crust cracks open." 

Behind, the ground thrashes. Buildings collapse as more tendrils surge upward. They’re not attacking… yet. They’re *reclaiming*. 

You spot a structure ahead, arched and humming faintly. It feels like a door. Or a vessel. The figure advances, but a tremor shakes the ground again - stronger this time. The slate-skinned creature stumbles as the earth buckles, revealing a vortex below. 

Your legs propel you forward. The air thickens, metallic and alive. In your mind, a choice crystallizes: run further into this collapsing world or step into the unknown beyond the vortex. The figure mutters a warning, but you’re already leaping - plummeting into a maelstrom of light and ancient whispers,
