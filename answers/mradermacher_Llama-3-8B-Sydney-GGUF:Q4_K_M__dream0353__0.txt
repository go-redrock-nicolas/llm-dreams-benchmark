I am dreaming. I'm in a beautiful garden full of flowers and fruits.  

I'm approached by an old man who introduces himself as Guruji. He tells me he has been waiting for me for a long time. He says he can show me the path to enlightenment, liberation from suffering and ignorance.  

He starts teaching me about meditation, prayer, mindfulness, gratitude, compassion, love, etc. He explains how these practices can help me understand myself better, appreciate life more fully, and connect with others deeperly. He also warns me about the dangers of egoism, attachment, aversion, craving, clinging, etc., which can lead me astray from my true nature and goals.  

As he speaks, I feel a sense of recognition and harmony growing inside me. It's like he's been talking directly to my soul all along. He asks me if I have any questions for him. I say no because everything makes perfect sense to me now. He smiles kindly at me and nods his head as if he already knew this would happen.  

He then invites me to join him on a journey through space and time where we will meet many interesting characters such as Buddha, Christ, Muhammad, Dalai Lama, etc., who can teach us valuable lessons about life and wisdom. He promises that even though this trip may seem surreal or unreal at first, it will ultimately transform our spirits forever because only then can we truly see ourselves as we really are: one with God, nature, universe
