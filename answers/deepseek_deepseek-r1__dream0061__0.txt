I am dreaming. Start by vividly describing my stage in the dream.  How do the errors in my materials manifest?  Are there unusual symbols, shifting text, or other surreal elements?  

Please craft the initial scene of this anxiety-driven lucid dream, focusing on sensory details and emotional undercurrents.Okay, the user wants a vivid dream scene filled with anxiety, focusing on sensory details and emotional undercurrents. Let me start by setting the stage. The scenario is presenting life's work to experts, but there are errors in the materials. So I need to make the stage surreal and the errors have to feel surreal and transformative. 

First, the setting: grand auditorium, but maybe it's shifting. High ceilings could warp, making it feel oppressive. Lights might be too bright or have an otherworldly glow. Maybe intimidating panel members with shadowy faces or strange features like iridescent eyes. That adds to the anxiety.

Now the materials. The papers should start normal but then morph. Text could bleed or rearrange into unknown symbols. Maybe images melt or become alive. I can use sensory details like the texture of the paper changing, a metallic smell from the ink, colors shifting. The user feels panic, but in the dream, there's a surreal beauty to it.

Emotional undercurrents: fear of judgment, desperation, the oppressive atmosphere. Including body sensations like cold sweat, clammy hands. Maybe the sound of the audience murmuring or an ominous hum. 

I should make sure the scene is vivid and immersive. Use metaphors, like equations unspooling into snakes or gears, blending logic and chaos. The dream logic allows for impossible transformations, so I can push the surreal elements. Also, including the idea that part of the user finds it fascinating even in panic. That adds depth to the emotional state.

Need to balance between the anxiety and the dream's fantastical elements. The errors aren't just mistakes but become something alive and uncontrollable. Maybe the presentation materials are a living entity, resisting the user's control. Ensuring rich sensory details—sight, sound, touch, smell. Maybe even a taste, like blood from biting a lip.

Check if the user wants the initial scene only. They mentioned crafting the initial scene, so don't go beyond that. Start with entering the stage, noticing the errors, and building up the tension. No resolution yet. Focus on creating a palpable sense of dread mixed with surreal beauty.
The air in the auditorium is thick with the scent of ozone and old parchment, as though lightning and ancient libraries have collided. The stage beneath your feet feels unnervingly alive—a grid of hexagonal tiles pulses faintly, glowing like bioluminescent honeycomb. Above, a vaulted ceiling stretches into infinity, swirled with nebulous constellations that twist into equations you once recognized but now mock you with fractal riddles. The panel of experts sits shrouded in shadows at a curved obsidian table, their faces blurred save for their eyes: iridescent, lidless, flickering between human and insectile, like dragonfly wings catching light.  

Your notes, crisp and orderly moments ago, now writhe on the podium. The text bleeds into writhing glyphs—half-mathematical, half-symbiotic organisms—that wriggle off the pages like silver eels. Diagrams of your research mutate as you touch them: timelines branch into fungal networks, bar graphs sprout thorns, and a critical flowchart drizzles downward like wax, pooling into a small black mirror reflecting your face… *younger*, terrified, mouthing words you can’t hear. The laser pointer in your hand flickers erratically, casting not light but *shadows* that cling to the walls, clawing at your slides.  

You try to speak, but your throat fills with the taste of iron and lavender. The audience leans forward in unison, their collective breath a low, resonating hum that vibrates the marrow of your bones. In your periphery, the errors take physical form: a scrap of paper levitates, edges fraying into feathery cilia, and stitches itself into your sleeve. Numbers etched into your skin bloom into tiny gears, ticking backward.  

Panic rises, hot and metallic, yet part of you thrills at the chaos—the dream-logic beauty of equations unspooling into snakes, of data becoming alive, untamed. But the panel’s eyes narrow, glowing brighter. Their verdict, you know, isn’t about truth. It’s about whether you’ll let the chaos consume you… or reshape it.  

The first slide clicks. It’s blank. The screen behind you splits open like a pupil, revealing a starless void.
