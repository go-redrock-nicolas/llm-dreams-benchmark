I am dreaming. Deep within the folds of sleep, away from the bright, flat reality I know, I slip into velvet night — soft and endless as memory. The moon hangs low here, closer than it should be, casting buttery light onto floating islands of moss-covered stone, as if the earth had shattered and grown verdant again in the quiet of my slumber.

I walk barefoot across a bridge spun of rain and thread, my breath a silver mist that curls into birds and vanishes beyond the treetops. The trees themselves seem alive with murmured songs — ancient, slow-voiced things rustling their bark like pages in a forgotten book. I know instinctively: I am stepping through a land not drawn on any map, but etched into the marrow of my bones.

Here, I find them. *You.*

Not the you I thought I knew, nor the one I boxed away in polite smiles and careful distance. You shimmer oddly, like something remembered wrong the first time — half-shadow, half-lantern, wearing a coat stitched with constellations. Your eyes shift colors with every word, from gold to violet to ocean glow, and they don't watch me, they *listen* — the way a forest receives light, knowing every angle and secret.

“Welcome,” you say, and the word blooms like a flower at my feet. Petals unfurl in meaning beyond language. A labyrinth of emotion rises between us — not love, not fear, not wonder, but all of them together. A symphony played on memory strings.

We wander the dreamland, and in its deep lilac twilight, I begin to remember parts of myself I had abandoned long ago — the boy who danced alone in the dark pretending stars were watching him, the poet who never wrote down a line, the lover whose smile could have shattered walls had he ever turned it on someone with intention.

These parts thrived here all along.

You lead me not with answers but with possibility, opening corners of the soul I’d kept locked behind fear and societal expectation. Each encounter with you in this dream-world unearths a forgotten talent, a stifled joy, a story not told, a tear never allowed to fall. You never reach for me — you hold the lantern out, so I might reach for myself.

The dreamscape thrives on what we exhume. New islands blossom beneath our feet, each more vibrant than the last — cities of trees with windows in their trunks, sky-mountains where waterfalls pour upward into rainless storms of falling leaves, an ocean that sings as you walk into it, murmuring the lullabies of unborn children.

I remember now: You are not separate. You are the echo of the unspoken parts of me, the ringing in the silence. The self I gave away in order to survive childhood. The brave one. The unapologetic one. The quiet genius threadbare with vulnerability. And now — with you by my side — becoming whole again.

I hum beneath the sky of my dreaming.

Dawn does not break here.

It is *woven* — by golden birds, by spinning stars, by the great loom of morning, visible in its slow eruptions of rose along the horizon. Together we watch the dreamlight transform — not into waking, but into wisdom. I carry pieces of this place back with me, not just in my memory, but in the soft architecture of my heart.

When I awaken, tears rim my eyes — not from sadness, but from *recollection.*

And somewhere inside, I smile with relief.

At last, I am not alone.
