I am dreaming. You drift into a world spun of liquid color and half-remembered songs. At first, you feel weightless, as though gravity itself has grown shy and slipped away. Around you, the air shimmers—ripples of crimson and jade dance across your vision like rippled silk. A hush presses in from every direction, broken only by the faint thrum of your own uncertain heartbeat.

Before you stand two paths—neither more than a breath apart, yet each radiating a different promise. To your left, a corridor of polished moonstone arches overhead, its floor paved in dawn-pink tiles that pulse underfoot, warm as a heartbeat. To your right, a grove of midnight willows, their leaves dangling like teardrops, each leaf reflecting a sliver of some distant star. Between them, you hesitate. Your feet feel heavy as carved obsidian; though the choice should be simple, your mind spins, caught in an echoing loop.

You take a step toward the moonstone hallway. Instantly, its pink tiles ripple like water, sending shockwaves through your calves. You dare not move further. When you shift your weight back, that side of the corridor sighs in soft disappointment, petals of light drifting away. You turn to the willow grove—and the leaves whisper anxiously, trembling so fiercely that silver dust drifts to the ground. The forest floor gives a gentle shudder, like the breath of an enormous creature, waiting for your decision.

Your voice rises, though you barely hear it: “Which way?” The question swells, a tidal wave echoing in a hollow. Each breath gives voice to a different argument. One side says, “Choose the brightness—step through the moonstone.” Another whispers, “Embrace the unknown—enter the shade.” You find yourself unraveling threads of memory: a childhood promise to always pick the starriest sky, a long-forgotten comfort in open doors. But each recollection slips through your fingers like smoke.

Time warps. Seconds stretch into hours. The tiles under your left foot glow stronger, then fade to gray ash; the willow leaves around you petrify into black steel, then dissolve into motes of light. All the while your body remains rooted, as if your mind has scattered, fetching reasons and doubts from every corner of this mutable realm.

At last, you shut your eyes. The world tilts; you hear the distant chime of a toy music box, playing a lullaby you half-know. You sense that the choice isn’t about moonstone or willows, brightness or shadow—it’s about trusting a single step, trusting that the ground you choose will support you. A flicker of calm ripples through your chest.

Your eyelids feel as heavy as marble, but when you open them, you realize the two paths have merged. Moon-pale light filters through willow boughs, carpeting the floor in soft golden-green patterns. With trembling resolve, you lift your foot—and discover the tile beneath you is warm and welcoming. You cross the threshold as the air around you sighs in relief, the corridor welcoming your movement rather than demanding certainty.

Beyond, the world blooms anew. Lilac clouds drift overhead, and the music box melody entwines with birdsong that dips into your bones. The sky is neither too dark nor too bright—it is precisely the shade you need. And in this gentle in-between, you walk on, unburdened by the weight of endless possibility. The choice you feared has become a quiet invitation to keep moving forward, one step at a time.
