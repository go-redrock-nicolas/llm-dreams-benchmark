I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself standing in the heart of Grand Central Terminal, New York, in the late 1940s. The grandeur of the lobby, with its ceiling a limestone barrel vault adorned with constellations in gold leaf, stretches out above me. The echo of bustling chatter and the rhythmic dance of hundreds of shoes stepping in sync with the grandfather clock's pendulum fill the air. The aroma of roasted coffee and fresh pastries wafts from the nearby Oyster Bar, intersecting with the scent of a thousand cigarettes, creating an atmosphere as familiar as it is exhilarating.

Suddenly, a train arrives with an urgency that makes the very walls seem to tremble. A sole figure descends, cloaked in a tattered overcoat, face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat and a swirl of soot. They approach me, their stride determined yet weary. "You must come with me," they rasp, grasping my arm with surprising strength. "There's not much time."

We push through the crowds, away from the main concourse, past the whispering galleries, and into a forgotten corridor. The figure stops abruptly, turns to me, and removes their hat. Beneath it, they bear the face of an old friend, now gaunt and stern. "The city will be destroyed in one hour," they announce, voice laced with desperation. "A wave, unlike anything we've seen, is coming. You must warn them."

I gape, struggling to comprehend. "What kind of wave? How-"

My friend silences me with a pleading look. "No time for questions. You must believe me. I've seen it. Help me warn them, please."

Overwhelmed, I nod, and together we rush back into the teeming heart of the terminal. We shout, drawing stares, but our cries are dismissed as Seattle street preacher theatrics - eccentric, pull-yourself-together ramblings. The crowd continues to ebb and flow, oblivious to the impending doom.

I clutch my wristwatch, fingers tracing the.second hand as it jerks relentlessly forward. 55 minutes left. We race to the information booth, but the attendant raises an eyebrow, unimpressed by our urgent pleas. Our next stop, the police box, yields no more success. The officer listens, then tips his hat, shooting us a skeptical glance before walking away.

Time grows short. We toggle between futile attempts to rouse authorities and desperate bids to alert individuals. I watch the clock's relentless march with a growing sense of unease. 45 minutes. 40. 35. Each tick Another grain of sand slips through the hourglass. My heart races, palms slick with sweat, yet my actions remain measured, voice steady. I can't afford to lose control.

My friend, however, begins to unravel. Their eyes dart, wild and fearful. "We're not going to make it," they gasp, backing away from me. "We're all...doomed." With that, they turn and disappear into the crowd.

I falter, but only for a moment. I won't give up. I won't. Drawn by an inexplicable force, I find myself at the ankles of an elderly woman, her Folkish dress and educated demeanor suggesting wealth and influence. She regards me with cool curiosity as I explain our dire situation. For an instant, I swear I see concern flit across her face. But then, she smiles thinly, pats my shoulder, and says, "It's been a pleasure, dear," before walking away.

25 minutes left. I stand alone in the throng, each face rejecting me, each pair of shoulders sloughing off my burden. The air grows thick with tension, time's noose tightening. Yet, within me, a steel cord unwinds, resolve solidifying. I won't accept this fate. I will warn them. I must.

Turning to face the crowd, I take a deep breath, gather my voice, and bellow, "EVACUATE! EVERYONE, EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY! A WAVE IS COMING! GET TO HIGH GROUND NOW!"

Heads turn, frowns furrow. Someone laughs. But others hesitate, eyes narrowing, uncertainty planted. I seize the moment, exhorting them to flee, painting a vivid picture of annihilation. The mood shifts; worry starts to grow.

15 minutes. We surge towards the exits, a tide of confusion and fear. I weave through the crowd, exhorting, directing, ushering. The terminal empties, echoing with empty commands and hushed whispers. I fall back, watching the last stragglers race onto the street.

10 minutes left. I stand at the terminal's bronze doors, watching, waiting. The city hums around me, oblivious, happy. My warnings have reached some, but not all. Will it be enough? Have I done enough?

5 minutes. A distant rumble reaches my ears. The ground trembles. People scream. Panic Doctor. A towering wall of water crashes down 42nd Street, devouring everything in its path, swallowing buildings, cars, lives. I stand frozen, aghast, as the wave roars towards the terminal, hungry, indifferent.

Time slows. I taste salt, hear the_many-voiced cries of the doomed. My reflection shatters in the polished door. Then, darkness. Silence.

I wake with a start, heart pounding, body covered in cold sweat. The clock reads 4:35 AM. The house groans with the day's first light. It was just a dream, I tell myself, taking deep breaths to calm my racing heart. Just a dream.

Yet, for a long time, I sit there, haunted by those twisting streets, the metallic taste of impending disaster, the echo of desperate pleas. The vividness of it all leaves me questioning. Was it a dream? Or a premonition? Only time will tell. For now, I can only trust that, in the depths of that horrifying vision, I did all I could. I warned them.
