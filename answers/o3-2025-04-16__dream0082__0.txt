I am dreaming.

The moment I become aware of the dream, I find myself high above an endless sea the color of candle-waxed jade. I’m standing on the deck of a ship fashioned entirely from stained-glass windows: decks of amber, rails of sapphire, masts of ruby through which moonlight flows like milk. Every footstep rings out in crystalline chimes, each note echoing far below into the green water. A warm wind smelling of old libraries fills our sails, and the constellations overhead flicker as if restless to tell secrets of their own.

At the bow stands my dearest friend—let me call them “Lyra”—laughing beneath a whirl of lantern-fireflies. The glow paints their hair rivers of copper while they lean over the rail counting distant islands that appear and vanish like skipped heartbeats. Lyra’s joy is so bright it could ignite the ocean, and in that gleam I remember why I love them like a sibling. Then a hush falls: a single firefly leaves its swarm, drifts toward me, and settles on my palm. It flashes once, twice, three times—then melts into ink. The ink sinks into my skin, and suddenly I know.

It is a secret, black as eclipse glass: a truth about Lyra’s life that would shatter them if spoken. I don’t see words so much as feel them, like heavy stones submerged in my chest. They say someone they trust is about to betray them; their garden of hope will be salted before dawn. If I warned them, their faith would implode. If I stay silent, they might walk willingly into heartbreak—yet perhaps learn a hard wisdom they will need later. Either way, the future screams.

The dream reels. A clap of thunder fractures the sky into tessellated panels that drift downward like wallpaper scraped from a ceiling. Through each hole I glimpse another place:

• A desert of silver sand where clocks grow on vines and vultures wear judge’s wigs.  
• A cathedral carved into the husk of a whale, its organ pipes made of hollow bones singing a lament for lost sailors.  
• A garden floating upside-down, whose lilies reach upward into nothing while their roots drink starlight.

Every vision seems to ask: “What are truths for, if not to be spoken?” Yet each scene ends in silent collapse, as if the question itself is too sharp for the dream to hold.

I flee below deck, into corridors of kaleidoscopic glass that bend light into ribbons. Doors sprout along the walls like sudden memories. Behind one, I can hear my own heartbeat playing a slow waltz on an unseen piano. Behind another, Lyra’s laugh, echoing yet distant, a childhood recording nearly worn through. At last I reach the engine room: no pistons, only an enormous hourglass. Instead of sand, it holds letters—folded notes, unsent confessions—pouring from one bulb to the other in a glittering cascade. Every grain of paper bears a secret not yet revealed. My hands itch; I sense my own letter lodged somewhere in that storm.

I try to pluck it out. The glass goes soft as honey in my grip, but when I press my arm inside, the letters swarm around as though alive. One unfolds, and I glimpse Lyra’s face drawn in charcoal, eyes wide with betrayal. Another shows a mirror: in it I am older, alone, clutching a sealed envelope I never had courage to deliver. In terror I yank my arm free; my sleeve is soaked with spilled ink that spells out a single word—CHOICE—before fading.

The ship shudders. Back on deck, Lyra calls to me. The sea has turned to frosted crystal, cracking beneath the hull. I realize the vessel is frozen mid-voyage, and only I can move. Lyra strides toward me, smiling, unaware the dream’s fabric is fraying. They hand me a seashell shaped like a half-moon. “Listen,” they say.

Inside the shell I hear their heartbeat—as steady as trust, as fragile as glass.

“Something’s troubling you,” Lyra says, brow furrowing. “Tell me.”

I open my mouth. Words gather at the edge of my tongue like birds about to migrate. I can feel the moment stretch, a filament of time thinner than breath. Then I taste wind—the wind of waking—and realize the dream is ending. The stained-glass ship splinters into kaleidoscope shards. The shell in my hand crumbles to sand, and Lyra fades into dawnlight.

And I, hovering between sleep and morning, still hold that ink-heavy secret. It pulses like a second heart, asking to be spoken, promising ruin, offering truth.

I wake with tears drying on my lips, the scent of ancient libraries lingering in the room, and the faint chime of glass still echoing in my ears—an after-note of an unanswered choice.
