I am dreaming. You drift first through a twilight forest whose trunks glow with pale lavender veins, each footstep stirring up motes of light that spiral like fireflies. You’re soaked in a soft, sympathetic hush, as though the very air around you knows the heavy knot in your chest. Every inhale tastes faintly of mint and possibility. You realize you’ve been carrying a burden so vast it has hollowed out the path beneath your feet, until today—you’re not alone.

Ahead, through a column of iridescent birches, you sense movement: a circle of lantern-bearers stepping into view. Their lanterns pulse with warm gold and emerald, mirroring the gentle thrum of their hearts. Faces turn toward you, each bearing signs of battles fought in silence—scars glowing faintly like the first rays of sunrise. As they reach for your hand, you feel a tremor in your own, a bridge forming between your fear and their compassion.

They lead you to a clearing where silver mist drapes the mossy floor in swirling ribbons. In the center, a crystalline fountain gushes sapphire water that sings in soothing tones. Each lantern-bearer dips a fingertip into that song-water and presses it gently against your forehead. The liquid cools your burning worries, washing away the weight you’ve carried alone. You feel memories of shared struggles twining with your own, weaving a tapestry of relief and solidarity across your mind.

Suddenly, the moon overhead ripples like liquid mercury, and from its surface you hear whispers—voices of countless souls who’ve found strength together. “We know,” they murmur in a chorus of kindness. “We’ve been where you are.” With each echo, the knot in your chest loosens. The lanterns brighten until the whole clearing is awash in warm luminescence. You take a deep breath and realize your lungs no longer ache.

In that moment, clarity blooms. You stand taller. The mist parts to reveal a path of polished stone laid out for you alone. With each step forward, the lantern-bearers fall back silently, their lights shining like guiding stars. You press on, heart light, carrying a newfound conviction that no challenge is insurmountable when met in company. The forest fades, but the lantern’s glow remains within you, a living promise that you are seen—and that you will never struggle silently again.
