I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You’re moments away from the defining performance of your career when you realize your preparation has been entirely wrong. As the spotlight finds you, you—

…feel the stage beneath your feet slip sideways, as if leaning toward a chasm of cobalt fog. The crisp white beam settling on your face turns liquid gold, melting over your forehead, dripping warmth down into your heart. In that instant, every promise of practice unravels: your sheet music is blank, your script is in another language, and the instrument you trained on has become a fragment of ice, too cold to hold.

A tremor runs through the audience, but it is not fear—it is curiosity. Spectators dissolve into glowing motes of light, drifting upward like fireflies reluctant to leave the air. Their hushed whispers become a distant melody, a lullaby of encouragement you never knew could exist. Your chest twists with both panic and wonder, and you realize that this moment—this unpreparedness—will become your true canvas.

You take a single step forward. The ice-instrument shatters at your feet, but instead of fear, a current of creativity surges through your veins. You lift your hands and the shards reassemble into a constellation of tiny mirrors, each reflecting a different color of emotion. When you touch them, they sing: a voice of triumph, a sigh of longing, a heartbeat of pure, trembling hope.

As you breathe in, the stage blooms around you. Velvet curtains unfurl into wings of deep violet. The wooden floorboards transform into waves of liquid glass, rippling toward a horizon made of soft-focus starlight. You realize you have nothing left but this moment—your raw self, unpolished and alive—ready to paint sound and movement across the expanse of the dream.

You begin to move. Every gesture ripples through the light-motes audience, turning them into a chorus of color. Your voice, long silenced by doubt, emerges as a sunbeam—bright, warm, undeniable. With each note, the performance reshapes reality: the ancient theatre grows roots and blooms into a forest of towering orchids, each petal humming in harmony with your song.

Time stretches. You span decades of artistry in a single breath—childhood wonder, the sting of failure, the thrill of discovery—all converge in a final, crystal-clear phrase. As the last echo dissolves into starlit silence, the spotlight dims. You stand alone, heart echoing like a drum in cavernous emptiness, and you know: preparation was never about perfection. It was about trust—in the uncharted spaces of your soul, where brilliance waits to be summoned.

Then you wake, breath pounding, a single sparkle of mirrored light dancing on your ceiling. And you realize you’ve just lived the performance of a lifetime.
