I am dreaming. I'm floating on a cloud, surrounded by an endless sky of deep indigo, and spotting sporadic, glowing stars across the horizon. A warm light radiates from my body, and I'mesubmerged in tranquility. Suddenly, I am transported to a hospital, and I'm no longer floating. The hospital is bustling, and I'm restricted to the ground. I'm assigned to triage victims during an unprecedented disaster with inadequate medical resources and contradictory protocols.

As I rush toward the triage area, a cacophony of screams and sobs fills the air. The once-pristine hospital is now a scene of unrelenting chaos. Stretchers are strewn about the floor, some holding patients whose faces are etched with pain, while others lie empty, their sheets stained with blood and sweat. The acrid smell of antiseptic coupled with the metallic tang of blood assaults my nostrils, threatening to overthrow my resolve.

I approach the first stretcher, my heart pounding in my chest. A young woman lies there, her leg twisted at an grotesque angle, shards of bone protruding through her skin. She's clutching her leg, her face contorted in a silent scream of agony. I take a deep breath and thrust my hand into my pocket, searching for the color-coded tags used to prioritize the patients. My fingers brush against the tags - red for critical, yellow for serious, green for minor, black for deceased. Each tag weighs heavier in my hand than the last.

As the situation deteriorates further, the hospital's resources become increasingly strained. Beds are in short supply, and even the more stable patients are forced to wait in the corridors, their moans and whimpers echoing through the hallways. Outside, ambulances line the streets, their lights blaring in vain as they attempt to unload their cargo amidst the chaos.

I make my way to the next stretcher, my senses on high alert. A middle-aged man is there, his chest barely rising and falling, a faint trail of blood trickling down his chin. His eyes, though glazed over, lock onto mine, and I see a glimmer of desperation within them. I fumble for a moment with the tags, hesitating between yellow and red. Both seem tragically inadequate for the gravity of the situation.

The hospital's staff is stretched to its breaking point. Doctors and nurses move with a frenzied pace, dashing between patients, trying to triage the ever-growing number of victims. Contradictory protocols swirl in the air, sparking heated debates among the medical staff. Some advocate for prioritizing the most critical patients, while others argue that saving as many lives as possible, regardless of their current condition, is the more ethical approach.

As I delve deeper into the triage area, the sounds around me seem to intensify. The beeping of heart monitors, the alarms of life support machines, and the frantic cries of the patients blend together into a symphony of despair. And yet, amidst all this chaos, I see profound acts of humanity - a nurse holding the hand of a child, a doctor offering words of comfort to a dying man, and a group of bystanders risking their lives to bring in more patients.

The scene shimmers like a mirage in the desert, as if it could dissappear at any moment. The lights seem to fade and the colors lose their vibrancy, becoming flat and lifeless. And suddenly, I'm back on my cloud, floating in a vast expanse of tranquility. The scene of chaos and despair is now nothing more than a distant memory, a vivid dream that has disappeared, leaving behind only its echoes. I drift deeper into the sky, carried by the winds of my imagination, to see what other wonders and challenges it holds.
