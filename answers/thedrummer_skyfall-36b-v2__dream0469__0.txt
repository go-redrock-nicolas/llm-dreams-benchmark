I am dreaming. deep dive into my subconscious, and my thoughts morph to scenes and scenarios. As the scenery shifts and changes, so do finding myself oscillating between extremes rather than finding sustainable middle paths.

The dream begins with me standing at the edge of a vast chasm, a gaping maw stretching out before me, dark and forbidding. I know I must cross to the other side, but there are no bridges or ladders in sight. Two options present themselves:

To the left, a narrow ledge clings to the side of the cliff face, barely wide enough for my feet. But it seems to be the only way across, and I hesitate only briefly before stepping onto the thin strip of rock, one hand pressed against the cliff wall for support. The ledge winds and twists, sometimes almost horizontal and sometimes at an almost vertical incline. Shadowy, circular chunks of rock appear to be missing as I cautiously pick my way along. The depth of the abyss on my right is unsettling as I struggle to keep my balance, knowing that one false step could send me plummeting down into the oblivion below. But I soldier on, determined to reach the other side no matter what it takes.

To the right, a massive rope bridge sways in the wind, attached to sturdy poles on either side of the chasm. The bridge looks rickety and unsteady and the ropes frayed and worn, but it is the only other option besides climbing down into the abyss and then back up the other side. I take a deep breath and step onto the bridge, feeling it shift and bounce beneath my feet. The wind whips at my clothes and hair as I make my way across, gripping the ropes with white-knuckled tension. The bridge creaks and groans with each step, and I have to fight the urge to turn back. But I press on, knowing that I must keep moving forward.

As I near the midpoint of the bridge, I realize that the bridge is not the only thing moving. The very cliff sides are crumbling away, chunks of rock falling away as if consumed by some unseen force. Slowly taking more and more chunks, stretching from the top of the chasm to deeper below. I force myself to look away, focusing instead on the ground beneath my feet. But it is no use - as soon as I have shifted my gaze, I feel the world tilting and lurching around me.

Panicked, I stumble forward, my feet hitting the solid rock of the other side. But the chute beneath the bridge need not search, the crystal water beats a strange rhythm upon the rocky ground, seeming to beckon to me with every splash and ripple. The call of the water is intoxicating, and before I can talk myself out of it, I have dove in fully clothed, my body slicing through the cold liquid like a knife.

The water is freezing, so cold that it nearly stops my heart. But it is also exhilarating, and I feel alive in a way that I haven't in a long time. I swim deeper and deeper, my lungs burning and my muscles aching with the exertion. The water around me seems to shift and change, sometimes clear and sometimes opalescent, sometimes calm and sometimes turbulent.

As I swim, I feel a presence in the water with me, something ancient and powerful and alive. I catch glimpses of it in my peripheral vision - a flash of scales, a glimpse of fin, a flicker of movement in the darkness. The being comes closer, circling me like a shark. I know that it is dangerous, that it could easily overwhelm me and drag me down into the depths to join the sunken ruins and shipwrecks at the bottom of the chasm.

But I also feel a deeper connection to the creature, an almost magnetic pull that tells me it means a deeper meaning, what lies underneath calls to me, beckoning me to get to know myself on a level on which I have never been before. 

So I turn to face the creature, staring into its strange and knowing eyes. And in that moment, I understand.

The balance that I have always sought, the middle path between two extremes - it is not something that can be found with logic or reason. It is something that must be felt, intuitively, in the depths of one's being. And it is a balance that is forever shifting and changing, just like the business world, just like the very nature of reality itself.

I realize that to find true equilibrium, I must be willing to embrace both extremes - to dance at the precipice of the chasm, to cling to the ledge even as it crumbles beneath my feet, to give in to the call of the water even as it threatens to sweep me away. I must be willing to hold two opposing truths in my mind at once, to find the sweet spot in the tension between them.

With this new understanding, I slowly swim back to the surface, emerging from the water and making my way back across the bridge, my feet from the watery ground beneath me pockmarked pits where I walked. Not trusting the rickety structure with the new force and understanding I posessed.

As I climb up the other side of the chasm, I know that I will never forget this dream, this lesson. And I know that it will guide me in the years to come, helping me to navigate the challenges and contradictions of life with grace and wisdom.
