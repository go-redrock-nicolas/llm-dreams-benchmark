I am dreaming. As your eyelids flutter, the last tendrils of sunlight seep through the cracked window blinds, casting long, jagged shadows across the room. You blink away the sleep, and your senses begin to catch up with your mind, which feels hazy, saturated with the weight of the day. You sit up, swiping an arm across your face, and feel a slight dampness—a cold sweat?—against your forehead. Your body feels heavy, sluggish, yet your mind protests against the idea of waking, as if breaking the surface of consciousness will shatter something fragile inside you.

And then, like a wave crashing against a shore, you remember.

The house.

The house is crumbling.

It’s not just one crack in the foundation, not just a loose board or a leak in the roof. The walls groan, as if the weight of the sky itself presses down upon them. The floorboards creak underfoot, the ceilings sag, and you’ve tried to patch the holes in the plaster, but they reappear, like the earth is reclaiming itself through the walls. This house, your house, the place you’ve poured your love and time and energy into, it’s falling apart. You can feel it in your bones, as if the house itself is a reflection of something deeper, something inside you.

You stand up, your feet meeting the cold hardwood floor. There’s a strange sensation, a heaviness in your chest, and you draw in a deep breath, only to find that it fills you with the faint scent of wood rot and mildew. Your hands shake slightly as you reach for your phone, tapping the screen to life. 9:03 PM. The light from the screen stings your eyes, and you squint as you try to piece together what’s next.

You walk into the living room, where the ceiling fan spins lazily, its blades creaking with every revolution. The air is stale, unmoving, but you can hear the faint hum of electricity behind the walls, the dim glow of a bulb struggling to stay alight. There’s a heaviness in the air, as if the house itself knows that it’s dying. You walk toward the kitchen, where the linoleum is peeling back at the edges, curling like dead leaves in autumn. The refrigerator hums faintly, and you open it, searching for something to ground you. It’s empty, except for a few condiments and a carton of milk that expired weeks ago.

You close the fridge, turn to leave, but something stops you. There’s a noise, faint at first, but growing louder. It’s the sound of something creaking, something that shouldn't be moving at all. You step forward cautiously, listening, and the sound grows louder. It’s coming from the basement.

The basement, a place you’ve avoided for months, because every time you go down there, it feels like you’re stepping into a grave. It smells of damp earth and mold, and you’ve always told yourself that if you don’t go down there, maybe the problems will just disappear. But now, the creaking has your attention. You walk toward the basement door, your heart pounding in your chest. You place a hand on the doorknob, hesitating for a moment. You know what’s down there. You know the damage.

But you also know that you can’t avoid it forever.

You push the door open, and as it swings inward, the creaking sound grows louder, becoming a low, mournful groan. The stairway down is dimly lit, a single bulb hanging from the ceiling by a frayed wire, and as you descend, the sensation of cold, damp air seeps into your skin. At the bottom of the stairs, you find the source of the noise. A beam, thick and solid, has cracked, splitting down the middle like the ribs of a dying animal. Dust swirls in the air, caught in the light from the bulb, and you raise a hand to your face to shield your eyes.

There, at the center of the beam, something catches your eye. A small, dark shape, nestled in the splintered wood. It’s a bird—a sparrow, small and fragile, its wings folded tight against its body. The bird doesn’t move. Its eyes are closed, its chest barely rising and falling. You stoop down, reaching out a trembling hand to touch it. As your fingers brush against its feathers, it stirs, its small black eyes opening, staring up at you with an unspoken plea.

And then, without warning, the bird takes flight, its wings beating frantically against the dank air of the basement. It soars up toward the ceiling, circling once, twice, before vanishing through a crack in the wall. You stand there, watching as it disappears, and in its place, you feel something inside you shift.

The house is broken, yes, but it’s not dead yet. Just like you. Just like the bird.

As you climb back up the stairs, the creaking under your feet feels different now. Not the sound of something dying, but of something shifting, finding its balance again. You walk through the house, taking stock of the damage with new eyes. There’s so much work to be done, you think, but there’s a quiet determination in your chest now. You’re not helpless, not anymore. You can patch the cracks, shore up the foundation, find a way to make it whole again.

Because the house, like you, is worth saving.

You close your eyes for a moment, breathing in deeply. The air no longer feels heavy, but full of possibility. There’s a long road ahead, and it won’t be easy. But for the first time in a long time, you feel something you thought you'd lost—hope.

And as you stand in the center of the room, the hum of the fan blending with the distant chirp of the sparrow outside, you realize that even as the house shakes, you’re still standing.

Still here.

Still alive.

You open your eyes, but the dream fades, leaving only a sense of something unresolved, something waiting just beyond the edge of wakefulness.

And then, you wake.
