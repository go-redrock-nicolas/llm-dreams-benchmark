I am dreaming. You stand at the edge of a labyrinthine library, its towering shelves carved from obsidian and amber, stretching into a vaulted ceiling where galaxies shimmer like dust motes in suspended light. The air hums with the scent of aged parchment and myrrh. Your fingers graze the spines of books—each one pulsing faintly, titles etched in cursive flame: *The Time You Spoke Too Soon*, *The Risk You Didn’t Take*, *The Words That Lingered Unsaid*. They thrum with heat, as though the choices within still burn.  

A low groan reverberates. The shelves tremble, leaning inward like dominoes poised to fall. Your breath hitches as you scramble to brace them, palms pressing against leather-bound regrets. But the tomes multiply, spilling onto the floor, pages fanning open to reveal scenes—frozen moments where hesitation or haste etched fissures in your history. A shadow detaches from the gloom, its form shifting between a coiled serpent and a faceless scribe, quill scratching *what if* into the air like venomous calligraphy.  

Then—a glint. A gilded mirror materializes amidst the chaos, its surface liquid silver. Within it, your reflection stands still, eyes twin stars in a storm. *Breathe*, it mouths, though no sound comes. You inhale, and the scent of jasmine cuts through the dust. The thundering shelves still. The mirror’s frame blooms with vines of wisteria, petals brushing your wrists, cool as forgiveness.  

One by one, the books dissolve into swarms of monarch butterflies, pages fracturing into wings that carry the weightless remnants of every miscalculation. The shadow-hiss fades, swallowed by constellations above. The library’s walls melt into a grove of birch trees, sunlight dappling through leaves that whisper in a language of root and wind. At your feet, a single book remains, its cover blank, quill resting atop it—inked not with doubt, but possibility.  

You wake as dawn spills honey-light through your window, the taste of jasmine still on your tongue, fingers curled around the memory of wings.
