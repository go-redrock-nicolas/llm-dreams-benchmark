I am dreaming. **The air hums with the scent of ozone and ink, thick as syrup in my lungs.**  

I stand in a vast, cathedral-like workshop—walls lined with towering shelves, each crammed with half-finished marvels: clockwork birds with sapphire eyes, maps that rewrite themselves in real time, books whose pages whisper secrets if you tilt them just so. My hands ache from hours of labor, fingers stained with the shimmering dust of something not quite of this world.  

A voice, smooth and impatient, slithers from the shadows. *"Faster,"* it insists. *"No one will notice if the gears aren’t polished. No one cares if the words bleed."*  

But I do.  

I press my palm against the current project—a music box meant to play the dreams of those who’ve forgotten how to sleep. The wood is warm, alive under my touch. If I rush, the song will crack. If I hurry, the lullaby will sour into a scream.  

The walls shudder. The shelves lean in, groaning under the weight of a thousand abandoned masterpieces—things made *fast*, not *right*. The clockwork birds twitch, their wings misfiring. The maps smear into nonsense.  

I tighten my grip on my tools.  

**"No."**  

The word echoes, and the dream shudders—not in anger, but relief. The workshop exhales. The music box glows, just a little, its melody purring against my fingertips.  

Some things *must* be done right. Even in dreams.  

(And then—because dreams are never just one thing—the floor opens beneath me, and I fall into a sky full of unfinished stars.)
