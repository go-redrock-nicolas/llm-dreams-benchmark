I am dreaming.

In this twilight country between awake and asleep, the landscape shimmers with possibility. I am walking along a misty shoreline—white sand flecked with fragments of seashells that glow pale blue beneath my feet. The ocean hums, its waves a gentle, pulsing heartbeat. Ahead, the horizon bends and tingles with amethyst light.

Cradled in my hand is a worn, wooden mask. Since I was small, I have worn it without question—a belief about myself etched into its features. “You are always shy,” the mask whispers, its grain patterned with old worry. Its eye-holes are too narrow; the mouth too tight. Yet I have kept it close, believing it is who I am.

But here, in this soft dream realm, something within me stirs—a quiet, golden energy blooming in my chest. I look down and realize: the shape of the mask no longer fits the contours of my becoming face. I feel no shame, only curiosity.

Kneeling on the damp sand, I lay the mask at the water’s edge. Gulls circle and call in the glowing sky. The surf reaches out, delicate fingers of foam caressing the wood. The mask dissolves gently into a mist, carried away on the breeze, leaving only ripples.

I stand, lighter now. My face is open, my eyes unshadowed. The air is suddenly sharp with the scent of orange blossoms, and the sand beneath me feels warm—alive. I breathe in, and my heart expands with possibility. I walk forward, every step easier, into a wide dawn, new and unencumbered.

With each stride, I sense new beliefs taking root: “You are bold,” they murmur, swirling around me in threads of sunlight, “You are free to choose who you become.” I smile, stepping into the luminous unknown, awake even as I dream.
