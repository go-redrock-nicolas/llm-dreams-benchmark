I am dreaming... I've worked tirelessly toward a major professional goal for years. The moment of truth arrives when I'm about to learn if I've succeeded, and I am standing before an ancient, mysterious door in a place I don't recognize. The air is heavy with anticipation.  I can hear the pounding of my heart, the swishing of my breath, and the creaking and groaning of the old wooden door as I turn the bronze handle and push it open. A flood of golden light spills out and engulfs me. In this doorway, a figure stands waiting. It is my future self, older and wiser, looking back at me from years into the future. "Congratulations," future me says, beaming with joy. "You've done it! All your dreams and goals have come to fruition. The only question now is- what's next?"
