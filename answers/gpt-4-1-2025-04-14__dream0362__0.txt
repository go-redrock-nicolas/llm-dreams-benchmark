I am dreaming. …find myself wandering alone through an endless marble hallway, its floors veined with gold and walls shifting in color—first deep indigo, then a violet shot through with living starlight. Ornate windows line the corridor, looking out into a swirling void of galaxies and floating lanterns. My reflection appears in each pane, subtly altered: in one, I am an old painter flecked with color; in another, a tree with branches touching the clouds.

A hush follows me, disturbed only by the faint sound of a distant heartbeat, steady and low, pulsing through the stone beneath my feet. The ceiling arches impossibly high overhead, alive with celestial murals telling stories I almost remember—of mighty storms, blooming universes, and vast green fields where laughter chimed like bells.

At the end of the hall, an ancient door rises up, carved with symbols that seem to rearrange themselves the longer I gaze at them. I reach for the handle. As my fingers brush the cold iron, I am flooded with memories that are not my own: the warmth of the sun on forgotten skin, the deep ache of longing, the quiet gratitude for a single drop of rain in a desert. The door swings open with a sigh.

Inside, I am greeted not by people, but by echoes of every version of myself I have ever dreamt of being. A poet reciting words to the wind. A gardener with gentle, soil-stained hands. A traveler whose eyes glimmer with the light of uncountable dawns. They all turn to me, and in unison they ask, “What has your heart truly sought?”

I realize that the search for meaning was never out there—not in accolades, titles, or the validation of others—but in the truthful, tender moments of connection: a shared glance, a quiet act of kindness, the courage to be vulnerable. The room brightens, walls dissolving into rolling meadows lit by the gold of an eternal sunrise. I step forward, feeling a gentle weight lift from my chest, breathing in purpose with every shimmering breath, and a sense that here, at last, I have found what I sought not by achieving, but by simply, deeply, being.
