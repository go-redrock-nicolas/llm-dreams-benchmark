I am dreaming. …step barefoot across the threshold of a house that seems to have been woven rather than built—its walls braided from aromatic reeds, its roof stitched with bolts of midnight-blue silk that flutter like captive constellations. Lanterns filled with firefly–bright embers float in slow spirals overhead, and every doorframe hums with a low, melodic drone, as though the building itself is composing lullabies for its inhabitants.

A grandmother—your new grandmother—greets you first. Her eyes are storm-gray, unreadable, but kind. Instead of words, she presses a warm palm to your forehead. Instantly, a hush settles inside your skull, as if a choir of worries has been politely asked to wait in another room. She gives a single nod, then draws an invisible sigil across your chest: three curves, two dots, and a flick like a shooting star. You understand none of it, yet feel irrevocably marked—branded not with ownership, but with belonging.

The rest of the family appears from alcoves and curtains like actors in a play already in progress. They wear layered garments that rustle like parchment when they move, each fabric panel painted with stories—epic battles in ochre, dancing cranes in jade, oceans rendered in lapis. You notice that no two patterns are the same; each person is a walking library of legend.

Tonight is the Celebration of First Echoes, though no one explains what that means. You only learn by doing. Your brother—tall, laughing, carrying the scent of citrus on his clothes—hands you a translucent mask carved from river ice. “Put it on before it remembers you,” he teases, though the words feel borrowed from a language you don’t actually speak. The mask fits like a cool second skin, and suddenly every sound in the house fractures into prismatic reverberations: footsteps become falling marbles, laughter becomes windchimes, heartbeats become kettle drums. You realize you can see people’s voices ripple through the air, each syllable a swirl of colored smoke.

You follow the family into a courtyard paved with mirrored obsidian panels. Moonlight rolls across them like spilled milk, and your own reflection fragments into a dozen drifting shards. Musicians sit in a ring, but their instruments baffle you: water-filled bowls stroked with pine needles, crystal tubes exhaling fog, ropes that hum when plucked. Yet the music they make settles inside your bones as though it has always lived there. Your new mother—elegant, silent—ties a silver ribbon around your wrist. It tightens with every anxious thought and loosens with every breath you take. You inhale, exhale, and feel it slacken, warm with approval.

Then comes the moment of the Echo. Each family member steps forward, touches a hand to your sternum, and speaks a single phrase in the lilting, twist-like-vine language of this place. You repeat the phrase back—not with your mouth, but with your pulse. You don’t know how you manage it, but you feel the words thrum through your arteries, drumming against your ribs until the others nod in satisfaction. When it’s your turn to greet them, you search for words you don’t possess. Instead you offer memories: the smell of rain on childhood pavement, the taste of snowflakes on your tongue, the sound of midnight trains calling like distant whales. Somehow the family hears you. They close their eyes and smile, as though you’ve given them a gift more fluent than speech.

A hush falls. Grandmother raises a lantern of swarming, luminescent moths. She asks—without speaking—if you will accept a new name: the Name of the Second Dawn. It is a name that must be sung rather than spoken, grown rather than given. You feel it coil behind your tongue: a note rising, trembling, ready to bloom. You hesitate—terrified that in accepting, you might erase the person you were before. Yet the grandmother’s eyes soften, and you realize the name is not an erasure but an embroidery, stitched atop the fabric you already are.

You open your mouth. The note unfurls, a flowering trumpet-vine of sound, and the courtyard answers: stars blink brighter, moth-lanterns flicker, the mirrored floor ripples like water. In that instant, you feel the vast canopy of this alien tradition settle over you—not as a cage, but as a sky too wide to measure. You are adopted not only into a family, but into a mythology, a texture of living where customs speak louder than breathing.

And just as the music rises toward its final crescendo, you wake—heart still ringing with river-ice echoes, wrist still tingling where silver ribbon once lay, the new name lingering like a half-remembered melody on the verge of being hummed.
