I am dreaming. I find myself drifting into a surreal dreamscape, where the boundaries of reality blur into a kaleidoscope of colors and emotions. I stand on the edge of a vast, shimmering desert, sands of gold and amber stretching endlessly under a sky that swirls with hues of violet and crimson, as if painted by a cosmic artist in the throes of passion. The air hums with an electric energy, a silent whisper of secrets carried on an unseen breeze, and I feel an unshakable certainty deep in my bones: everyone, no matter how they guise their actions, ultimately acts from self-interest.

As I tread barefoot across the warm, silken dunes, I see a figure in the distance—a woman cloaked in flowing robes of purest white, radiating an almost blinding aura of benevolence. She kneels beside a caravan of weary travelers, their faces etched with exhaustion and despair, offering them water from a crystalline flask that never seems to empty. Her smile is soft, her eyes brimming with compassion, and she speaks in a voice like a lullaby, proclaiming her work as purely selfless, a gift to humanity with no thought of reward. The travelers weep with gratitude, calling her a saint, an angel sent from the heavens.

But I stand back, my gaze narrowing, a storm of skepticism brewing within me. The desert around us begins to quiver, the golden sands rippling like the surface of a disturbed lake. I step closer, my shadow stretching long and dark behind me, and I see through the illusion. Beneath her radiant exterior, I sense a hidden hunger—a need for their adoration, their tearful thanks, their whispered prayers. Each drop of water she offers is a thread that binds their gratitude to her, weaving a tapestry of worship that feeds her soul. She claims altruism, but I see the truth: her charity is a mirror reflecting her own desires, a way to fill a void within herself, to be seen as more than mortal, to be loved beyond measure.

The travelers don’t notice as the desert shifts again, the sky darkening to a bruised indigo, thunder rolling in the distance like the growl of some ancient beast. I confront her, my voice cutting through the mirage like a blade. “Why do you hide your truth?” I ask, my words echoing across the dunes. “You claim to give without want, but even now, you drink deeply from their reverence. Is this not self-interest cloaked in virtue?”

Her serene mask falters for a fleeting moment, a flicker of something raw and vulnerable in her eyes—shame, perhaps, or defiance. The travelers turn to me, their faces twisting into masks of confusion and anger, but I stand firm, the sand beneath my feet growing hot as molten glass. She rises, her robes billowing like storm clouds, and instead of answering, she points to the horizon. There, a towering city of glass and light emerges from the haze, its spires piercing the heavens, a monument to human achievement. “See what selflessness builds,” she murmurs, her voice trembling with conviction. But as I look closer, I see cracks in the glassy towers, shadows of greed and pride lurking in their reflections. Even this grand creation, I realize, was built not for others, but for the architects to etch their names into eternity.

The dream spirals deeper, the desert melting into an ocean of mirrored water, reflecting a thousand versions of myself—each one questioning, doubting, peeling back the layers of every noble deed to reveal the selfish core beneath. I dive into the liquid mirror, sinking into its icy depths, and voices surround me, whispering of altruism, of sacrifice. Yet, as I swim through this endless sea, I see their truths too—every act of kindness tethered to a hidden gain, whether it be recognition, absolution, or the simple comfort of feeling superior.

I emerge on a shore of black obsidian, the jagged rocks cutting into my skin as I crawl forward, determined to find one pure, selfless soul in this dream. But the landscape twists again, morphing into an endless labyrinth of memories—my own, and those of others. I see parents sacrificing for children, only to crave their love and legacy in return; heroes saving lives, fueled by the thrill of glory; and even myself, in fleeting moments of generosity, quietly expecting gratitude or reciprocity.

As the labyrinth closes tighter around me, the walls pulsing like a living heartbeat, I come to a chilling realization: perhaps true altruism is a myth, a beautiful lie we tell ourselves to soften the sharp edges of our nature. Or perhaps, in this dream, I am the one deluded, too cynical to see the flickers of genuine goodness that might exist beyond my own shadowed perspective.

The dream begins to fray at the edges, the labyrinth dissolving into a mist of silver and gray, and I feel myself rising, pulled back toward wakefulness. But the question lingers, heavy as the obsidian shore: are those who claim altruistic motives deceiving themselves, or am I the one blind to a truth beyond self-interest? The last image before I wake is the woman in white, her face now a mirror of my own, her eyes asking me to look deeper—into her, into myself, into the very heart of what it means to give. And as the dream fades, I am left with a restless yearning to understand, to uncover if even a single act can truly be free of the self’s quiet, whispering desires.
