I am dreaming. And in this dreamscape, the sky is not the usual blue I’ve come to expect, but a shimmering twilight canvas, painted with hues I cannot name and barely comprehend—colors that seem to hum faintly, emitting melodies that feel like forgotten lullabies. As I float gently above a sea of crystalline waves that subtly sparkle like galaxies frozen mid-motion, I become aware that I am exactly where I need to be, not out of necessity but choice.

The air—thicker than Earth's, yet impossibly lighter, as though filled with whispered affirmations giving weightless lift to everything it touches—carries with it the scent of clarity and possibility, an aroma like lavender and burnt honey kissed by ocean breeze. There is a stillness here, not the absence of motion, but the kind that hums with infinite energy, vibrating in invisible lines between me and every other thing in existence.

I am in the realm of thought and time melted together, a place untouched by the worry that once rooted me deeply in a place of lack. My bare feet hover over glassy water that reflects what seems to be universes folding and unfolding, birthing and dying in elegant, rhythmic waves. And as I gaze down, my reflection isn’t mine—it shifts between versions of me: young, old, radiant, uncertain, strong, broken—each visage flickering in and out like stars playing hide-and-seek. But the face that remains longest is one I’ve not seen before, one with eyes like oceans teeming with light instead of water, a gaze that holds absolute serenity.

A spiral of warm, golden mist rises from beneath me, opening like a flower made of sunlight threads, its petals gently pulsing as though breathing. Sitting within the luminous bloom is a vision: the life I once desired but hesitated to pursue, often held at arm's length by the insidious whisper that I did not have enough—enough time, enough money, enough love, enough worth. I reach out, and it is not resistance I meet, but a gentle warmth welcoming me to reclaim the richness I had denied myself not due to true lack, but false perception.

Threads of liquid gold form around me like a cocoon, weaving something I didn’t realize I was missing: a bridge between doubt and faith, scarcity and abundance. As the threads bind, I feel no pressure, only possibility. My body hums with energy as the cocoon expands outward, becoming not a shield but a vessel—a vessel for trust in myself, my power, and all the gifts that I am and always have been.

I open my arms wide, offering myself to the twilight sky, and the stars respond in kind, cascading downward in slow arcs like meteors dipped in peace. As each streak lands—not with explosion, but explosion of feeling—I feel fragments of me coming alive that I didn’t even know were dormant: creativity I had buried beneath fear, compassion I had withheld out of self-preservation, expression restrained by the belief that my voice didn't matter. 

And then I hear the whisper that changes everything. 

It is not a booming voice of command, but a soft wind tinged with laughter, carrying words that melt into my bones: *You were never meant to ration joy. You were never meant to be so small. There is a galaxy inside you, and it burns proudly, even when unseen.*  

With this truth, I shift. Sink deeper into the gemstone sea, let the waves lap at every edge of my being—no longer resisting the abundance surrounding me, but drinking it in like it’s my birthright, which it is. The water feeds everything there is within me: my capacity for love, ability to create, hunger to grow, readiness to learn. 

And in this dream, I become—I AM—limitless. Not because I have conquered or conquered something concrete, but because I have chosen to see the truth: that resources, blessings, wonder, acceptance, connection, inspiration are infinite, and I am a vessel meant to carry, give, receive, and radiate. That I have always had and will always have more than enough—not just materially, but spiritually, emotionally, creatively. That I am part of something far greater, far richer, far more entwined with magic and momentum than I had ever dared to believe.

And there, in that spiral of gold and twilight and song, I awaken—not from the dream, but *into* it. Fully. Freely. Infinitely.

I am...abundance. And the dream belongs to me.
