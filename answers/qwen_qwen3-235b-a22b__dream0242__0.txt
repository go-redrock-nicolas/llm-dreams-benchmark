I am dreaming. You’re in a cavernous, cathedral-like chamber deep beneath the earth, where the walls pulse with veins of molten gold—rivers of liquid energy coursing through the bedrock like the lifeblood of some slumbering leviathan. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, a sound that vibrates in your molars and makes your vision blur at the edges. Overhead, a lattice of obsidian-black alloy groans as it contains the inferno below: a reactor core the size of a cathedral dome, its surface a shifting mosaic of fractal patterns that flicker between dimensions. It’s alive. It’s *aware*. And it’s unraveling.  

Alarms scream in a language older than humanity, their wails echoing off walls etched with runes that glow faintly green, then sputter like dying fireflies. The control panels in front of you—slick, organic interfaces that feel warm and pulsing beneath your fingertips—are melting. Literally. The screens drip like hot wax, forming grotesque, face-like puddles that whisper warnings in your own voice: *“You knew this would happen. You built this. You doomed us all.”*  

Outside the reinforced viewport, the first containment sphere shatters with a sound like a thousand glass harps being crushed. The second fails silently, its molecular bonds dissolving into a fine iridescent mist that rains upward, defying gravity. You smell burnt ozone and something sweeter, cloying—like overripe fruit rotting in a vacuum. The backup systems don’t respond. The failsafes are *laughing*.  

You run. Your boots slap against grated walkways suspended over a chasm where the core’s light bleeds into shadow, and the shadows writhe. Behind you, the walls buckle, extruding crystalline growths that hum with forbidden geometries. A door slams shut, not with machinery, but with a wet, organic squelch—as though the facility itself is rejecting you. You press your palm to a biometric lock, but it hisses and brands your skin with a sigil that glows like cold starlight.  

In the central chamber, the reactor’s heart begins to *sing*. It’s a sound that bypasses the ears and drills straight into the marrow, a hymn of annihilation that unknits memories. You see your childhood, your first kiss, your mother’s face—all unraveling like thread pulled from a fraying tapestry. The core’s fractal patterns now spiral outward, bleeding into the air, etching themselves into your retinas. You realize, with a gut-dropping certainty, that this isn’t just a meltdown. It’s an *invitation*.  

The facility was never meant to contain the core. It was meant to *birth* it.  

A figure materializes in the smoke—a silhouette with too many joints, its outline flickering between a human in a radiation suit and something insectile, vast, and hungry. It speaks without moving its head, its voice a chorus of static and sorrow: *“You fed it long enough. Now it hungers for the next course.”*  

The final failsafe—a massive lever forged from a meteorite—glows red-hot in the corner of the room. You grab it, your skin blistering, peeling like paper as you pull. The lever resists, then gives with a shriek that splits your skull open. A flood of liquid shadow pours from the core, swallowing the chamber.  

You wake up screaming.  

But the taste of ash and the weight of something *uncoiling* in your chest remain.  

And the numbers on your watch now tick backward.
