I am dreaming.

I float, unmoored, beneath a vast sky that shimmers with colors not found in waking life—petal-blue and honeyed magenta, pearl-gold and violet so deep it whispers secrets to my bones. The air hums with a current both thrilling and unfamiliar, and as I wander through this surreal landscape, I stumble upon a river formed entirely of liquid glass. Its waters ripple in slow motion, reflecting a world even stranger than this one.

Curiosity draws me to the edge. I lean forward and see my reflection wavering on the surface, but immediately, a cold knot twists in my stomach. The face that gazes back is mine, yes, but… not mine. The eyes are wider, irises swirling with nebulae, holding centuries of wisdom I do not possess. My hair blooms with pale fireflies, fluttering and casting luminous shadows across my cheeks. My mouth curves differently—a half smile, enigmatic, as though I’m privy to cosmic jokes that I’ve never heard before.

I reach a trembling hand toward the surface, my fingers passing through the cool glass, brushing the “me” that is not me. A surge of memory flashes behind my eyelids—snippets of lives I’ve never lived: I am a silent glider in an ocean of stars; a child running through midnight gardens dripping with heavy, sweet fruit; a giant whose hands sculpt mountains from clouds.

For a heartbeat, I am unanchored, tugged between these versions of myself, my sense of “I” unraveling at the edges. I realize that in this dream, the self is not a fixed point but a constellation, shifting with every breath and thought, every hope and fear. My reflection begins to laugh—a sound like chimes in a distant storm—and the land around me ripples with possibility. I understand, if only for this fleeting dream-moment, that I am more than I appear, deeper and vaster than any single image.

Beneath the unfamiliar sky, I allow the dream to carry me further, no longer sure where the boundaries of myself end and the world begins.
