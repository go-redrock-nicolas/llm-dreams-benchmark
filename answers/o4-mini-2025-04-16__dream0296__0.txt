I am dreaming. Floating just above a mirrored lake that ripples with impossible colors—amethyst, liquid gold, shards of emerald—I lean forward to touch the surface. In that moment, I glimpse my reflection. And it isn’t me.  

Eyes the color of storm clouds stare back, rimmed with dancing sparks of silver light. My hair billows around my shoulders like ribbons of mist, shifting hue from raven black to the pale glow of moonlight as I watch. My skin shimmers, textured like opalescent fish scales, and my lips curve into a half-smile I don’t recognize. My heart lurches as the yawning space between who I think I am and who I appear to be yawns even wider.  

A tremor of dissonance runs through me, as though my own identity has loosened its hold. The world around responds: the lake ripples in concentric circles that transform into giant, iridescent dragonflies skimming the water’s surface. Their wings beat out a rhythm that resonates inside my chest, and I feel both terrified and exhilarated.  

The reflection speaks—its voice echoing in my mind like distant thunder:  
“You have forgotten what you once were.”  

My brows knit. Despite the strangeness of the moment, an inexplicable longing wells up: to remember. I watch the dragonflies lift into the sky, trailing glittering arcs of light. Drawn by their dance, I stand and step off the lake as if it were solid ground. With each footfall, ripples of color bloom beneath me, pulsing in time with the whispering wind.  

Shapes emerge on the horizon: a city built of fractured gemstone and translucent spires. Each building hums with its own melody. The closer I draw, the more the city’s song harmonizes with the voice in my head, guiding me toward a towering archway carved from black quartz. There, etched in silver script, a name I cannot quite remember pulses with life.  

My reflection floats before me one last time—no longer tethered to the lake but hovering in midair—and gazes with an urgency that sets my veins humming. In its eyes I sense both question and invitation: Who do you choose to be?  

And as reality ripples, I feel the threads of my waking self begin to reweave. I stand at the threshold, heart pounding, ready to step through and reclaim—or reinvent—the story that awaits beyond this dream’s fragile glass.
