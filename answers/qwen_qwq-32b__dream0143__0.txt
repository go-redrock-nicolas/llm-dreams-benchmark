I am dreaming. I'm in a library, but it's not a standard one. The walls are lined with books, but these books have shifting, almost liquid covers. The pages turn by themselves, and the words rearrange into different languages, then back again. The rows of shelves stretch into infinity in all directions, but I can't see the ends. 

I recognize a few titles: *Principia Mathematica*, *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, some heavy tomes on quantum gravity and chaos theory. Then there's a book I can't quite make out—it pulses like a heartbeat, and its pages are screenshots of real-time data streams: stock markets, weather patterns, neural networks. 

My fingers tremble as I pick up the latest one. The text starts flowing through my mind in a torrential rush. Equations self-assemble in my thoughts, but there's no end to them. I try to write them down, but my hands move too fast for the paper to keep up. My muscles feel like hot wax, my eyes blur, and my breath shortens. witos? No, that’s the name of the café I used to go to. Something registers—a cognitive dissonance between what the books are teaching and what I can retain. 

In every mirror reflection I see myself as five different scholars: a coder in a lab coat, a poet with ink-stained hands, an astrophysicist with a kaleidoscope in her pocket, a psychologist debates herself, and a historian who wears time on a string like a necklace. But as I blink between them, their images disintegrate into static.

The room itself begins to morph, the shelves contract into a nebula, and starred equations bloom across the cosmos. The air hums with the weight of unsolved theorems. I feel both exhilarated and cornered, as if the universe itself is testing me. A voice whispers: *Can you hold infinity in the palm of your hand?*

I try to answer but choke on the density of information. My vision tunnels—there are fractals in the shadows, gears turning inside my skull, synapses flashing in neon. The books melt into liquid light that wraps around me like a cocoon...

...and I realize it’s all a preface. The true knowledge remains locked in a paradox that I can almost grasp, but it’s just beyond my reach. The dream threatens to collapse under the weight of its own meaning—yet I push forward, because that’s what dreams are for.\n
