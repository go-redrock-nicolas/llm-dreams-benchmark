I am dreaming. You are dreaming. In this vivid dream, you find yourself walking through a surreal cityscape where towering buildings shift and morph like sand dunes in a desert wind. The streets are alive with an ethereal glow, casting shimmering reflections onto the pavement, which feels both soft and firm beneath your feet. Though you are alone, you feel an overwhelming sense of companionship as the buildings seem to whisper secrets just beyond your comprehension. Suddenly, you come upon a massive, ornate door that wasn't there before. It beckons you to enter.

As you push it open, light pours out, and the world inside is breathtakingly beautiful and strange. You are in a vast library, but the books are alive, whispering their stories through faint, musical voices that echo throughout the grand hall. You walk past row after row of golden spines, each one glowing softly, and you begin to feel that every book contains a part of you. You pick one up and open it, only to find it blank. As you stare at the empty page, words begin to appear, as if written by an invisible hand. The message is both eerie and enchanting: _You learn information that would devastate someone close to you if revealed. As they unknowingly continue their life while you hold this burden, you begin to question your identity, your purpose, and the lines between right and wrong._

Suddenly, you are no longer in the library but standing alone in a dark, endless void, unable to even see your own hands in front of you. You call out, but there’s no sound. The burden of knowing weighs heavily on your chest, and you feel like you’re drowning in your own thoughts. Suddenly, you realize you’re not alone. A figure begins to form before you, soft and indistinct at first, but soon becoming more clear. It is the person whose life would be shattered by the knowledge you hold. They look at you plea with you, their eyes pleading for mercy, for understanding, but you cannot speak. In the void, you are silent.

In that moment, you are torn between protecting them and knowing that your silence could prevent catastrophic consequences. You want to reach out, to scream, to do something, but your voice is stuck in your throat. The dream shifts, and you find yourself back at the beginning of the void. The figure disappears, and you realize that the dream is giving you a choice: reveal the truth and risk everything, or carry the burden forever and live with the consequences. You wake up with a start, the weight of the decision still heavy in your heart.
