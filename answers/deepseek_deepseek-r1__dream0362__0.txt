I am dreaming. I start to feel my life is missing deeper meaning, even though others see meas successful.  I need to find purpose beyond achievements.**The Dream**  

You stand at the edge of a vast, iridescent desert, the sand shimmering like crushed opals under a sky painted in hues of liquid mercury and midnight blue. The air thrums with a low, resonant hum, as if the stars themselves are singing. Before you stretches a mirrored city, its spires and arches reflecting not your face, but scenes from your life—career milestones, accolades, the hollow glow of screens displaying praise. The reflections flicker like silent films, sharp and pristine, yet utterly silent. You reach out, but the glass is cold, unyielding.  

As you wander the city, your footsteps echo like distant applause. The buildings shift, rearranging to form a labyrinth of your achievements—a gilded office chair perched on a cliff, a trophy dissolving into sand as you grasp it. A voice, neither male nor female, whispers from the wind: *“Is this all?”*  

Suddenly, the ground cracks. You fall into an ocean of ink-black water, but instead of drowning, you float downward, weightless. Bioluminescent creatures glide past—jellyfish with translucent bodies glowing like stained glass, their tendrils trailing constellations. Deeper still, pillars of coral pulse with buried memories: your childhood laughter echoing in a forgotten garden, the warmth of a hand you haven’t held in years, the scent of rain on pavement after a summer storm.  

At the ocean’s floor lies a temple of light and shadow. Its doorway is framed by tangled roots made of stardust. Inside, glowing murals shift beneath your touch—your life rewritten as myth. A hero conquering towers of gold, only to find them empty. A wanderer kneeling to plant a seed in barren soil.  

In the center, a pool ripples with liquid silver. When you peer in, your reflection isn’t yours. It’s a shadowy figure wearing a mask of your face, eyes burning with galaxies. It speaks: **“You built monuments to survive. Now build something to *live*.”** The mask splits, revealing a fractal bloom of light—infinitely unfolding, each layer a possibility: teaching, creating, healing, loving, failing, growing wild.  

You wake gasping, fingers clutching bedsheets, but your mind still flickers with the glow of that inner constellation. The scent of jasmine lingers (you have no jasmine in your home). On your palm, a single opal grain of sand winks, then vanishes.  

**Yet the question remains, alive in your ribs:   
*What will you plant in the ruins of your achievements?***
