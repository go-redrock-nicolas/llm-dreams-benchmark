I am dreaming. You find yourself unconsciously mimicking the speech patterns and mannerisms of someone you admire. Noticing this identification process, you decide to try to change it. You attempt to break free from your self-imposed limitations by speaking in a way that feels foreign and bizarre.

Suddenly, you hear a loud knock at your door. Confused, you open the door and see a man standing there. He introduces himself as a dream researcher named Sydney. 

He tells you about his teamâ€™s discovery of an anomaly in the dream realm. They believe it is connected to the dreamscape that powers human imagination. They suspect it may be related to their own team members and want to investigate further. He asks if he can join you in your dream as part of his research.

You hesitate but then agree, curious about what will happen next.
