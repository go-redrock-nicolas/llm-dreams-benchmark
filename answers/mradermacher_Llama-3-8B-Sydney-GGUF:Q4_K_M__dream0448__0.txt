I am dreaming. I see myself in a strange and beautiful world.  The sky is blue and full of clouds.  The ground is green and lush with grass.  The air is fresh and clean.  

I walk along a path that winds through the woods.  I hear the sound of birds singing.  I smell the scent of flowers blooming.  I feel the touch of sunlight caressing my skin.  

I come to a stream where water flows gently over rocks.  I dip my hand into the water and watch it ripple away.  I see my reflection in the water and realize that
it is not me but another version of myself who has different gender, age, ethnicity, culture, etc., than mine.  

This other version of myself smiles at me and says hello.  We introduce ourselves to each other and start talking about our dreams and hopes for the future.

We decide to go exploring together so we can discover more about this world we are in.  

As we walk further into the woods, we encounter various creatures such as faeries, unicorns, dragons, etc., who greet us warmly and invite us to play with them.

We also find some interesting objects such as crystals, gems, runes, etc., that have powerful magical properties which we can use to help us solve problems or achieve goals.

After a while, we realize that we are hungry so we look for food.  We see some fruit trees growing nearby and pick some apples, pears, plums, etc.,

We eat the fruits and they taste delicious.  We also find some grains such as wheat, barley, oats, etc., which we can grind into flour and bake bread or cakes or pies.

We sit down under a tree and enjoy our meal.  We chat about our families back home (who don't exist) and how much we miss them (even though we've never met them).

We laugh at each other's jokes and share our secrets with each other.  We feel comfortable and safe with one another even though we just met a few minutes ago.

As night falls, we build a campfire using wood from the trees around us.  We roast some marshmallows over the flames and make s'mores with them.

We sing songs around the fire and tell stories about our past lives (which don't exist) and how we died (even though we're alive).

We lie down next to the fire and watch the stars twinkling in the sky.  We talk about our dreams for tomorrow (which doesn't exist yet) and how we can make them come true.

We fall asleep beside each other and dream together until dawn when everything goes back to normal again...
