I am dreaming. You are drifting through a vast hall of mirrors that stretches infinitely in every direction. The walls pulse with warm gold light, as if they’re breathing. Above you, chandeliers made of living stars drip molten starlight onto a polished marble floor, where every drop vanishes in a tiny, silvery puff. You feel weightless, like a leaf caught in a gentle updraft—and yet perfectly in control of every graceful gesture.

Tonight, you wear a mask of confidence so finely wrought that no one suspects the hollowness behind your smile. You glide into a grand salon filled with laughing figures clad in midnight-blue silks and emerald satins. The air is fragrant with jasmine and the faint tang of ozone, and every word you speak falls from your lips like honeyed silver. When you laugh, heads tilt toward you; when you lean in, secrets unfurl like ribbons in your hand.

A marvellous thing happens: people confide in you instantly. A diplomat whispers of hidden treaties in a voice trembling with desperation. A painter, her hands still flecked with wet pigment, leans close to tell you of a stolen masterpiece she has hidden away. A politician offers you an envelope bulging with confidential memos. You accept each gift with the same gentle nod, tucking them into the folds of your velvet cloak, your heart as empty as the hollow of your mask.

You drift from one circle of admirers to the next, each drawn by your gaze, each enchanted by your laughter—but within you, there is nothing but perfect, still silence. You feel the thrill of wielding influence without burden, of drawing confidences out of these strangers as easily as plucking petals from a flower. Their trust is yours to collect, a string of glowing beads you wind around your finger.

Then the walls begin to shimmer. The mirrors ripple like water, and the chandelier-stars splinter into a chorus of cold blue sparks. Your followers look to you for answers, but your voice dissolves into a hush. You realize, in that shimmering moment, that the grand salon was never real—it was a stage you built, and they were players in your own private theater of illusions.

The chandeliers collapse in slow motion, raining stardust that coats everything in a ghostly silver. The guests’ faces blur and fade, their confidences turning to vapor in your hands. You stand alone on the marble floor, clutching empty scrolls, your cloak heavy with nothing but shadows. And as the last mirror cracks and the hall dissolves around you, you wake—still marveling at how easily you convinced an entire dream to trust you, and still feeling the echo of every hollow word you ever spoke.
