I am dreaming. The classroom walls pulse with a faint, otherworldly glow, as though the air itself is charged with the hum of distant stars. The desks, carved from polished obsidian, feel strangely warm to the touch. Your exam paper unfurls like a scroll of living parchment, its edges flickering with bioluminescent ink that shifts colors as you read. The first question materializes not in words but in sensations: *Describe the taste of time.* Before you can process it, the room dissolves. Suddenly, you’re standing in a desert of black sand beneath a kaleidoscope sky, where constellations rearrange themselves into equations. A whispering breeze carries fragments of half-remembered lectures—*quantum nostalgia, the calculus of longing*—as a pendulum swings overhead, each arc dripping liquid silver that crystallizes into formulae. Your pencil morphs into a quill made of starlight, and as you write, the ground beneath you cracks open, revealing a labyrinth of mirrors reflecting futures you haven’t lived yet. A clockwork owl lands on your shoulder, its gears clicking out a riddle: *What grows heavier the lighter it becomes?* The exam isn’t testing your knowledge. It’s dissecting your soul.
