I am dreaming. The amphitheater materializes around me, its marble tiers gleaming under impossibly bright stars that seem to hang just above the open-air ceiling. I stand on a circular stage of polished obsidian that reflects fractured versions of myself back at me. Before me, hundreds of faces swim into focus—luminaries in their fields, their expressions expectant, critical, knowing. Their collective brilliance feels almost tangible, a pressure against my skin.

My hands tremble as I glance down at the instrument before me—not a musical instrument, but something more complex, a contraption of glass tubes, shimmering liquids, and delicate mechanisms that I somehow understand will translate pure thought into visible reality. I am to perform what they call "consciousness architecture," a feat requiring perfect concentration and depths of creativity I've never before accessed.

The program in my hands lists my name alongside a description that claims mastery I don't possess. Cold sweat beads on my forehead as I realize the audience expects transcendence, but my preparation feels gossamer-thin, a veil that will tear the moment I begin.

The chairman approaches, her footfalls echoing with terrible finality. "Three minutes," she whispers, her eyes knowing, perhaps pitying.

Panic rises like floodwater, but then—a peculiar calm washes over me as I notice something strange about the audience. Their faces occasionally ripple, like reflections in disturbed water. The stars above shift constellation patterns I've never seen in waking life.

The realization blooms: this challenge isn't what it seems. The test isn't of my preparation but of my ability to surrender to the impossible. I place my hands on the cool surface of the thought-instrument and feel it hum with recognition. Perhaps I've always known how to do this. Perhaps the preparation happened in another life.

I close my eyes, and when I open them, the audience has leaned forward in perfect synchronicity, their collective breath held. I am afraid, and yet, I begin.
