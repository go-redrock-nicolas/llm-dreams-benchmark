I am dreaming. I find myself in a grand hall made of mirrors that stretch endlessly upward, each reflection showing a slightly different version of myself. As I move through the space, whispers of praise echo from unseen voices - congratulations for achievements, admiration for talents, recognition of hard work. With each compliment, I feel my body physically trying to shrink, to become smaller, to hide from these well-meaning words.

The mirror versions of myself begin reacting differently to the praise - one stands tall and proud, graciously accepting the acknowledgment; another turns away in shame; a third tries desperately to deflect the kind words onto others. I watch, fascinated and uncomfortable, as these reflections play out different responses to recognition.

Suddenly, the floor beneath me becomes transparent, revealing layers upon layers of buried accomplishments I've minimized over the years - awards tucked away in drawers, heartfelt thank-you notes never fully read, moments of triumph deliberately forgotten. They glow with a warm golden light that begins seeping upward through the glass, wrapping around me like a gentle embrace.

As the light touches me, I feel the weight of an old familiar voice - one that always whispered "you don't deserve this" or "they're just being nice" - beginning to lift. The mirrors around me start to show memories of times I worked hard, of genuine impact I've had on others, of real value I've created. Each reflection now holds a truth I've been afraid to fully own.

The discomfort doesn't disappear entirely, but it transforms into something more like butterflies of excitement rather than knots of anxiety. The whispers of praise continue, but they begin to sound less like judgment and more like simple statements of truth - neither inflated nor diminished, just real.

As the dream fades, I'm left with the lingering sensation that perhaps accepting praise isn't about worthiness at all - it's about allowing others to share in the joy of something good, about completing the circle of human connection through both giving and receiving appreciation.

I feel myself floating upward through the layers of consciousness, carrying with me a new understanding that discomfort with praise doesn't have to mean rejection of it - that perhaps there's growth in learning to sit with both the unease and the acknowledgment, letting them coexist as I learn to see myself more clearly through others' eyes.
