I am dreaming. I find myself awakening on a spiraling path of luminous moss, each step sending ripples of soft blue light across the forest floor. The air tastes like liquid silver and distant thunderstorms. Above me, the canopy is a cathedral of ancient trees whose branches intertwine to form living architecture, their leaves translucent as stained glass, filtering sunlight into prismatic patterns that dance across my skin.

I realize with startling clarity that I can sense the forest's pulse—not merely hear it, but feel it resonating through my very cells. Each tree communicates in a symphony of electrical impulses that I somehow understand. They speak of centuries of rainfall, of fungal networks carrying nutrients to struggling saplings, of the slow dance of seasons.

When I place my palm against a massive trunk, centuries of memories flood through me: glaciers retreating, civilizations rising and falling, countless creatures seeking shelter in its branches. I am simultaneously infinitesimal and vast.

The boundary between my body and the forest begins to blur. My veins mirror the streams cutting through the underbrush; my breath synchronizes with the gentle sway of ferns. Butterflies with wings like illuminated manuscripts land on my shoulders, imparting ancient wisdom through their delicate touch.

In the distance, a clearing reveals a pool of water so still it appears solid. When I approach, my reflection shows not my familiar face but a mosaic of every living thing I've ever encountered, their eyes looking back through mine, reminding me of our unbreakable interconnectedness in the tapestry of existence.

I understand now. I am not merely in the forest—I am the forest, and it is me.
