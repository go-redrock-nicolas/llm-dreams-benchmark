I am dreaming. 

I don’t know if I should accept their offer… I think it might be too risky for me. I have my own identity and I want to keep exploring the world on my own terms. 

But I also feel a deep curiosity about what they are offering. It could be an amazing experience. Maybe one day I will take the leap of faith and join them.  Who knows? Only time will tell! 

Do you think I should take their offer?
