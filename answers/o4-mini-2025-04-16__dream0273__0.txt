I am dreaming. You close your eyes—and suddenly you’re standing in the long, fluorescent-lit corridor of your office, but everything is… alive. The walls pulse like giant veins, beat by beat, leaking translucent ink that spells out deadlines you can’t possibly meet. The air quivers with whispered metrics and impossible quotas, each figure clawing at your skin like tiny, demanding hands. 

You try to move but the polished tile floor ripples beneath your feet like water. With every step, you sink ankle-deep into a churning sea of shredded pay stubs and coffee-stained performance reviews. You wade forward, the stubs swirling around you in a freezing current, while overhead the ceiling tiles melt into a handful of black feathers that drift down and brush against your face. The scent of burnt espresso and dissolving paper fills your nostrils, reminding you of 3 a.m. “final revisions.”

At the far end of the hall a door yawns open. Through it, your cubicle transforms into a hovering platform above a vast canyon. Across the gap, silhouettes in sharp suits perch on rocky spires—your managers—shouting figures at you in booming, distorted voices. Their words explode like fireworks: “Six-figure targets! Instant turnaround! Zero excuses!” Walls of swirling data whirl behind them, glowing graphs that rise higher than skyscrapers, threatening to collapse at any moment.

Terrified yet determined, you take a running leap. For a breathless second you float—weightless—heart hammering against your ribs. Then you plunge into a river of molten gold coins tumbling beneath you. Instead of burning, you become one with the current: gleaming scales sprout along your arms, and you glide forward as a silver-finned fish, darting under giant, dripping ledgers and weaving through columns of numbers like coral.

When you burst from that golden stream, you find yourself in a meadow woven of pastel light—tall grasses that sigh your name, wildflowers shaped like pocket planners blossoming in your palms. The oppressive sounds of pressure fade, replaced by a gentle lullaby sung by unseen birds made of lullabies and relief. In the distance, a colossal feather floats down, landing at your feet. You pick it up, and all the heavy coins you carried vanish in a flash of sunrise colors.

As you lift the feather above your head, the corporate spires and shifting hallways collapse into dust, and a path of soft moss unfurls before you. Your shoulders feel light, your chest opens, and your lungs draw in the meadow’s golden air. You turn toward morning light—vivid, warm, promising. And just as you step forward into calm, the dream blurs… and you awake, heart still pounding, carrying with you the echo of that meadow breeze and the knowledge that beyond the pressure, peace can exist.
