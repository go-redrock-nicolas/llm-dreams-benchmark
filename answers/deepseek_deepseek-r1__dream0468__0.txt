I am dreaming. In the inky depths of this dreamscape, I find myself standing at the edge of a labyrinth carved from obsidian glass. Its walls shimmer like liquid midnight, reflecting fractured versions of my silhouette — each one flickering with ephemeral words caught in their throats, sentences dissolving like ash before completion. The air thrums with the low hum of unspoken thoughts, and the ground beneath my bare feet pulses like a heartbeat made of static. 

Suddenly, my shadow detaches itself and steps forward, its edges rippling like dark water. It opens a mouth full of starlight and begins to speak, but the sound comes out as tangled threads — crimson ribbons of anger, cobalt spirals of apology, silver strands of half-truths — all knotted into a humming, glowing mass that hovers between us. I reach out to touch it, and the threads burst into butterflies made of stained glass, their wings clicking like typewriter keys as they scatter. Each carries a syllable I’ve regretfully uttered, a phrase I’ve left unfinished.  

A river materializes beneath my feet, its current made not of water but liquid gold light. Fish made of whispers dart through it, their iridescent scales flashing with fragments of conversations I’ve rehearsed and abandoned. I step in, and the warmth rises to my knees, then my chest — not drowning, but baptizing. My breath slows. The water mirrors the labyrinth’s walls, and there I see myself: younger, fists clenched, shouting at a storm that wasn’t listening. The image shatters as a single word forms on my tongue, round and heavy as a moonstone: *“Wait.”*  

The labyrinth shifts. Walls become mirrors, then waterfalls, then veils of smoke. A doorway appears, framed by vines of glowing jade ivy that curl into question marks. Beyond it, a meadow stretches under a sky the color of tea-steeped twilight. Figures made of shadow and starlight drift there, their faces shifting — loved ones, strangers, versions of myself. Their mouths move, but no sound emerges. Instead, their words bloom as flowers in the air: peonies of patience, orchids of apology, dandelions of quiet curiosity. I pluck one, and its petals melt into my palm, a cool balm that travels up my arm and settles behind my ribs.  

A voice, neither mine nor foreign, vibrates in the marrow of my bones: *“To speak is to sculpt air. Shape it with hands that have learned stillness.”* The ground hums in agreement. When I open my mouth again, a single lotus unfurls from my lips, its petals etched with symbols I don’t recognize but feel deeply — a language older than words. The shadow-self across from me catches it, and for a breath, we are both holding the same truth.  

Then — turbulence. The dream shudders as if struck by thunder made of fractured glass. My chest tightens, old habits rising like black smoke. But the lotus in my hands pulses, its light piercing the haze. This time, I let the silence pool in my throat like molten silver until it cools into something deliberate, precise.  

When I wake, the taste of petals lingers.
