I am dreaming. I find myself on the top of a towering mountain where the air is thin and crisp, and the view - oh, the view! It's breathtaking. The horizon extends infinitely, painted with hues of oranges and purples as the sun begins to dip beneath the earth. A vast sprawl of green forests and glistening rivers lie beneath me, with the teeny-tiny hustle of civilization in the far distance.

I feel a tug on my sleeve and turn around to see a falconer with his majestic bird perched on his arm. The falcon looks at me with eyes of knowing - a deep, ancient wisdom swimming in those dark orbs. The falconer removes his hood and I'm taken aback. His eyes are a mirror to the falcon's - all-knowing, wise, penetrating.

"Would you like to fly with the falcons?" he asks, presenting an opportunity that is thrilling, yet filled with fear. He points to a contraption, it's something straight out of a Da Vinci sketch - wooden, with large wings spanning out, and a harness attached for the rider.

The risks are undoubtedly high. This is no commercial airplane, but a creation of wood, canvas, and hope. Yet, the reward is tempting - the exhilaration of soaring through the sky, the chance to experience what only birds have known.

After a moment's hesitation, I make my decision. Evaluating this high-stakes proposition, I step forward, allowing the falconer to strap me into the harness. My heart is pounding, a drumbeat of both terror and anticipation.

As I take a running leap off the mountain's edge, the vertiginous drop beneath me is terrifyingly beautiful. For a moment, we drop, my stomach in my throat and the wind whistling in my ears. And then, we soar!

The feeling is indescribable, a dream transcending reality. I glide through the skies, the wind whispering against my skin, the world unfolding beneath me. The falcon flies alongside, its scream echoing across the mountain as if cheering me on. 

I feel both infinitesimal against the vast expanse of the world, and yet, an undeniable part of it, woven into this tapestry of existence. Fear has no place here, not in the face of such splendid freedom.

For now, the gamble has paid off, and the beauty of the experience is worth every moment of trepidation. The thrill, the rush, the unparalleled serenity coexisting with sheer exhilaration, the sense of unity with the falcon, and, indeed, with nature itself - it's a dream I never want to wake up from. But this is dreaming, and in dreams, the dawn awaits.
