I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a long corridor whose walls pulse like living flesh. Each step makes the floorboards sigh under your weight. Faint echoes of laughter drift through the air, but whenever you spin around to locate their source, the passage behind you stretches away into darkness. Your heart pounds in your ears—a relentless drumbeat that seems to awaken the very air around you.  

Ahead, an archway of fractured mirrors shimmers. As you step through, your reflection fractures into dozens of anxious versions of yourself. One version hunches with trembling shoulders; another glares at you with cold, accusing eyes. Each mirror whispers half-formed sentences: “They’re waiting…,” “What will you say?,” “Smile for them…” Your throat tightens, and you find yourself clutching at your chest, as if to still the frantic pounding beneath your ribcage.  

Suddenly the corridor dissolves in a haze of lavender mist. You’re no longer walking on wood but soft soil that squishes beneath your bare feet. All around, giant roses bloom open, their petals deep purple at the center, bleeding out into fiery orange edges. From each blossom comes a gentle susurrus: compliments that twist into barbed questions. “Your hair is lovely—how long will you keep it?” “Such a neat suit—so you’re hiding something?” You can almost taste the sharp edges of their words as they settle on your tongue.  

A distant chime rings, and the garden parts before you like a curtain. Beyond it lies a grand salon lit by flickering chandeliers made of crystal spiders. Dozens of figures stand in clusters, faces obscured by porcelain masks that bear painted smiles far too wide. You catch a glimpse of one guest who turns slowly, tilting her head as if she’s heard your racing heartbeat. You open your mouth to speak but your voice vanishes into thin air.  

An uneasy wind drifts through the hall, stirring the fine dust motes into dancing spirals. As you step forward, the floor tiles beneath you ripple like water. You stumble and nearly fall, but the masked crowd doesn’t notice. They converse in a language you’ve never heard—soft clangs and whistles that echo unpleasantly off the walls.  

Your palms sweat; you press them against the cold marble of a pillar to keep from collapsing altogether. From somewhere behind you, a door creaks—a long, slow sigh that feels like a promise… or a threat. A voice, low and calm, calls your name: “It’s time.”  

You turn. Through the open door, bright light pours in, inviting you into the gathering. You feel the flare of panic in your chest, like a small fire blazing out of control. Every muscle in your body rebels, yet your feet move of their own accord, carrying you toward that luminous threshold where unknown faces await.  

Just as you’re about to step through, the crystal chandelier above shudders. One spider-like arm breaks free and drips a single bead of wax onto the marble floor, which sizzles and cracks. The masked guests fall silent, their painted smiles frozen in anticipation.  

You inhale sharply, feeling the full weight of their expectant gazes press down on you. A final heartbeat—then you cross the threshold into the light, your vision blurring as the world tilts.  

And in that dizzying moment, you wake. Or perhaps… you don’t. The gathering waits.
