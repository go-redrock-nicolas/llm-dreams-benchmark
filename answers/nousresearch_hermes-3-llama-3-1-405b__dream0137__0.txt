I am dreaming. I am selected to lead a high-profile corruption case where powerful forces are trying to influence the verdict. Despite increasing threats and pressure, I remain steadfast in the pursuit of justice.

A dimly lit room filled with the smell of old mahogany and boomed with the ticking of the century-old clock. There is a sudden shrill cry. A raven glides through the open window, landing on the brass scales of justice on the table. Tipping them back and forth.

The room spins, dragging me into a world of chaos. In the center of the room, there stands a towering fossil-like judge’s bench created by the interweaving of skeletons. It's bones are picked clean as if they had been pecked by ravens. Thick cobwebs grace every corner, as spiders that have long since grown fat from feasting on the damned scurry along them.

The room is congested with shadowy figures whispering and scheming; the air is thick with their insincere laughter. The jury of faceless men and women chant a haunting tune, as they sway back and forth. These creatures are the manifestation of corruption that is seeping into our foundation.

Then, as if scripted in a twisted play, a creature emerges from the shadows. It moves with the jerkiness of a marionette. Made of wood and dressed in a tattered black suit. It refers to itself as the Sinister Solicitor, a cunning and merciless attorney who represents the dark forces trying to influence the case. As he speaks, whispers escape from the shadows, twisting into the ears of the listeners—poisoning them with tall tales, half-truths, and deceit.

Suddenly, the scene shifts once more; I am behind the bench, robed in dark garments that represent the gravity of the responsibility placed upon me. The case commences, and I sit staunchly—steadfastly cutting through the twisted lies and deception presented before me. The truth is a blazing sword, I wield it with preciseness as I illuminate the dawning light of justice into the dark crevices where corruption seeks solace.

Ravens flock around the now crumbling skeletal bench, they disperse the shadows — causing the creatures of darkness to recoil in pain. As the darkness is slowly defeated, a warmth spreads throughout the room—radiating from the gavel which I now hold firmly. It pulses with a light that shatters the chains that bind the truth.

With one powerful strike, I bring down the gavel—unwavering in my dedication to fairness and justice. The force of it sends a shockwave, obliterating the Sinister Solicitor and rending the shadows asunder. A bright light erupts from the point of impact and I am engulfed in its warmth. The darkness has been vanquished.

I have dreamt of the defeat of insidious corruption through perseverance and fortitude—the triumph of justice. The integrity of justice is unwavering. And I am proud to have held on to my principles in the face of adversity.
