I am dreaming. The air shifts around me as I stand before an ancient door hewn from living wood, its surface swirling with patterns that seem to move when I blink. This is the entrance to the Labyrinth of Forgotten Thoughts, a place both terrifying and necessary to traverse. I've been told no one has ever reached its center and returned unchanged.

The challenge before me: to retrieve a memory that doesn't belong to me, suspended in crystal at the labyrinth's heart.

The door has no handle, no keyhole—just intricate symbols that rearrange themselves when I try to focus on them. I've been standing here for what feels like hours, my fingertips raw from tracing patterns that refuse to yield.

Then it occurs to me—perhaps the door isn't meant to be opened but understood. I press my forehead against the wood, feeling its warmth pulse against my skin. The symbols begin to whisper their meanings directly into my thoughts, not as words but as emotions and fragments of sensations.

The labyrinth beyond shifts constantly, corridors folding into themselves like origami crafted by invisible hands. The walls are lined with shelves holding glass orbs containing moments of time—first steps, last breaths, forgotten promises, unspoken truths.

As I navigate deeper, the passages flood periodically with colored mist—sometimes blue as sorrow, sometimes gold as joy—each fog triggering memories I didn't know I carried. I find myself walking through a gallery of moments both mine and not mine, boundaries blurring between self and other.

The center, when I finally reach it, isn't what I expected. There is no crystal, no singular memory to retrieve. Instead, I face a mirror pool reflecting not my face but countless others—overlapping, merging, separating. I understand then that the memory I seek isn't something to take but something to become part of.

I kneel at the pool's edge and touch its surface. The water rises to meet my hand, wrapping around my fingers like quicksilver before sinking into my skin. Knowledge floods through me—not as information but as connection, a thread binding me to all those reflections.

I turn back toward the entrance, but the labyrinth has changed. Now the path is clear, straight as an arrow, lined with doorways opening onto countless possibilities...
