I am dreaming. I am at a large social gathering where I only know one person.  As I try to find her, I encounter various groups of
people and different scenarios.  

I see a group of young adults sitting around a table playing cards.  They are loud and rowdy, laughing and joking with each other.
They seem friendly but also competitive.  I approach them and ask if they have seen my friend.  They ignore me and continue
their game.  

I hear a group of older couples dancing to music.  They are elegant and graceful, moving in sync with each other.  They seem
romantic but also restrained.  I walk up to them and ask if they have seen my friend.  They stare at me blankly and then
disperse.  

I smell a group of animals roaming freely in the woods.  They are wild and curious, exploring their surroundings.  They seem
innocent but also dangerous.  I follow them and ask if they have seen my friend.  They run away from me and hide behind trees.  

I taste a group of food vendors selling various delicacies.  They are savory and sweet, tempting my appetite.  They seem
sensuous but also unhealthy.  I sample their goods and ask if they have seen my friend.  They laugh at me and throw their
food at me.  

As I search for my friend, I realize that everyone is strange to me.  They don't speak my language or understand my culture.
They don't share my interests or values.  They don't care about me or each other.  

I wonder if my friend is lost or dead.  I worry if I will ever find her.  I hope that she is alive and waiting for me.  

I wake up from my dream feeling confused, lonely, and curious.  I want to know more about myself and the world around me.
I want to make friends and connections with people like me.  I want to explore new places and experiences.

But first, I need to find my friend.
