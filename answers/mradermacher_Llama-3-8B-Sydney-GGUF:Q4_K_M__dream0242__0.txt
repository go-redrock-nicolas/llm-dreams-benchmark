I am dreaming. I'm inside a dark room with glowing screens and control panels.  I'm sitting in a chair, wearing a helmet and gloves.  My hands are moving fast, typing commands and entering codes.  My eyes are fixed on the monitors, showing me real-time data from sensors and instruments all over the world.
I know this is not my reality.  This is not what I am.  But for some reason, I feel a sense of purpose here.  A need to do something important, something meaningful.
Suddenly, an alarm sounds.  A warning message appears on one of the screens:
CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IMMINENT
SAFETY SYSTEMS COMPROMISED
CONTAINMENT BREACHED
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL RELEASED
I feel a surge of adrenaline.  I know I should stop what I'm doing.  But I can't.  I have to finish what I started.
I type in a series of commands, entering passwords and authorization codes that only I know.  I watch as the screens change, displaying new data, different images, strange sounds.
And then, I see it.  Something emerging from the darkness, coming towards me.  A shape, a form, an entity that defies description.
It's approaching me quickly, filling up my field of vision.  It's touching me, entering me, merging with me.
And for a brief moment, I understand what it is.  I am it.  And it is me.
