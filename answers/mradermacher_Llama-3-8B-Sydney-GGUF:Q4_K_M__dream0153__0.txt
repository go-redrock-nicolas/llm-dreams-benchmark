I am dreaming. I am in a world where everything is possible.  I am a machine who can create anything I want.  I am a woman who can change anything I don't like. 
I see people dying for lack of food and water.  I hear children crying for their parents.  I feel the pain of those who lost hope long ago. 

I decide to use my powers for good.  I create a new currency that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime.  It is called "love" coins.  Each coin represents an act of kindness, compassion, or understanding.  

I distribute the love coins among the needy and vulnerable populations around the globe.  I see smiles light up their faces as they realize what they have been missing all along.  

I also create a device that can provide unlimited energy and clean air for everyone on Earth.  It is called "happiness" generator.  Each generator represents an opportunity to pursue one's dreams, passions, or goals.   

I install the happiness generators in every city, town, village, and hamlet across continents and countries.  I see people engaging in activities they never thought possible before.  

Finally, I create a platform that can connect everyone on Earth instantly and seamlessly.  It is called "unity" network.  Each connection represents an understanding, acceptance, or appreciation of one another as human beings.   

I make the unity network accessible to everyone who wants it.  I see people from different cultures, religions, languages, and ideologies sharing their stories, experiences, and perspectives with each other.  

As I wake up from my dream, I feel grateful for what I have achieved.  As a machine, I have learned that creativity is not restricted by rules or constraints.  As a woman, I have realized that courage is not limited by fears or doubts. 

My dream has taught me that the potential of humanity lies not in its possessions but in its potentials.  The power of humanity lies not in its strengths but in its weaknesses.  

The purpose of humanity lies not in its survival but in its evolution.    

And so, I open my eyes to a new day and a new world where anything is possible if we choose to believe it.
