I am dreaming. …fall into a dream that opens like a stage curtain—slow, rust-colored velvet parting to reveal a dripping midnight sky. Stars pulse like living eyes, blinking in unison to an unheard rhythm. You stand barefoot on a bridge made of interlaced violin bows, each plank humming a single note when your weight shifts. The air smells of cedarwood and sea-salt, as though two incompatible worlds have collided.

Below the bridge waits a carnival you know is made entirely out of broken promises. Tents stitched from apology letters billow in a warm breeze. Lanterns bob overhead—glowing spheres of half-remembered excuses. Somewhere, a pipe-organ grinds out a melody that reminds you simultaneously of lullabies and sirens.

You are wearing a tailored coat whose pockets are bottomless. When you reach inside, your fingers brush evidence of things you never meant to do: crumpled receipts for lies told under pressure, tiny vials filled with secret envy, a squeaking compass whose needle points toward self-interest instead of north. Every item hisses like a guilty accomplice.

As you descend the bridge, crowds greet you with adoration. Painted faces cheer: “Champion of principles! Defender of justice!” Their praise feels like seawater poured into parched soil—both nurturing and corrosive. You realize with a jolt: they’re cheering for the version of you who signs manifestos, who preaches compassion, who promises transparency. Yet the fairground mirrors reveal another figure trailing one pace behind—your reflection wearing the same coat, but the pockets hang empty, having already spent everything inside.

A hawker beckons you into a striped tent labeled The Transaction of Shadows. Inside, a candlelit counter displays shimmering tokens: each one a shortcut, an easy way out. “Just one,” whispers the vendor, “and every wall melts before you.” You know that accepting even a single token means abandoning the painstaking path you claim to value. Your heartbeat taps the wooden floor like a telegraph key sending SOS.

But still, your hand hovers. You imagine impossible doors opening, locked rooms surrendering. You bargain: “Only this once. I’ll compensate later.” The tent suddenly expands—a cathedral of stretched canvas—so your solitary choice echoes as if shouted against vaulting stone. The vendor’s smile widens into the horizon.

You seize a token. It’s weightless yet terrifyingly solid, like a secret that refuses to stay buried. The tent flaps snap shut, sealing you in darkness. When light returns, you stand at a podium in a hall of devotees holding banners painted with your ideals. They roar approval you no longer deserve. The token burns inside your fist—branding your palm with a shape that’s unmistakably the letter Y, the branching question: “Yes to ease, or Yes to integrity?”

Your chest splits open—not physically but conceptually. Two enormous wings unfurl: one feathers pure white, the other tar-black. They beat in opposing directions, tearing the room apart in cyclones of paper slogans. Each slogan dissolves into ash before it hits the ground.

Suddenly you’re lifted through the hall’s shattered ceiling, borne upward by that internal conflict. The sky above cracks like an eggshell, revealing a second sky underneath—calm, cobalt, silent. There, definitions hang like constellations: HONOR glows in serif letters; RESPONSIBILITY flickers like a faulty neon sign; COMPROMISE drifts like a wisp of smoke. You float among them, pinning each word to your coat like badges—or shackles.

Then the token in your palm liquefies, becomes a silver mirror. When you peer into it you see not your face but the disappointed gaze of someone who once believed in you—perhaps your childhood self, or a friend who trusted you, or humanity’s collective hope. The mirror ripples; the gaze grows sadder. Your wings convulse. Feathers explode into starlight.

At last you understand: whatever you justify here, you will wake up still carrying in the shape of your life. No dream logic can erase the decisions etched on your marrow. The only path out is to unlatch your grip, release the mirror, and watch it fall like a teardrop into the chasm of swirling ideals below.

You open your fingers.

The mirror drops.

Instantly, the carnival, the bridge, the ragged tents—everything—folds inward like pages of a closing book. Sound implodes, leaving a ringing hush. You tumble backwards through the void until you land on a patch of soft moss under the dawn’s first lavender light.

Around you spread acres of fresh soil—blank possibility. The coat has turned transparent; its once-bottomless pockets are now open panes of glass. The wings, white and black, merge into a single set of translucent feathers that absorb color from the sunrise. You inhale and taste forgiveness—earthy, slightly bitter, but grounding.

In the distance, a seedling sprouts from where the mirror struck. Tiny leaves unfurl shaped like question marks, reminding you that growth begins not with perfection but with inquiry. You kneel, press a palm to the soil, and vow—quietly, fiercely—to honor the questions, to keep your hands clean enough that seedlings can thrive where you tread.

A lark takes flight overhead, its song threading you toward waking. As your eyes flutter open in the real world, the last echo of the dream lingers: a silver whisper at your fingertips, repeating one simple truth—

Integrity isn’t something you have or don’t have; it’s the daily choice of which seed to water.
