I am dreaming. You’re standing in a vast, cathedral-like hall constructed from shifting architecture—columns of liquid mercury ripple underfoot, walls of stained glass that depict your childhood fears refract light into jagled, bleeding colors, and a ceiling that isn’t there at all, only a swirling nebula of ink-black constellations. The air hums with the static of a thousand whispered critiques, voices that slither like silver eels through the gloom. You clutch your creation to your chest: a living thing, a fragile orb of blown glass containing a miniature forest, its trees made of frozen smoke and its rivers coursing with liquid starlight. It breathes. It *knows* it’s about to be judged.  

The critics sit in a semicircle on thrones woven from barbed wire and hummingbird bones. Their faces are obscured by masks—some grotesque, some eerily serene. One wears a porcelain mask of a weeping angel; another, a hood of writhing paper that scribbles and rewrites its own face in jagged cursive. Their eyes, visible through slits, are black as obsidian and sharp as scalpels. You step forward, your bare feet echoing on the floor, which ripples like the surface of a pond. With every step, the orb in your hands grows heavier, its forest wilting, its rivers drying to cracks.  

“You call this *art*?” hisses the critic with the paper hood. The words materialize as locusts, gnawing at the edges of your creation. The glass begins to fissure.  

But then—a sound. A low, resonant chord, like the vibration of a harp string plucked by the moon. From the shadows emerges a figure cloaked in a robe of moth wings, their face hidden beneath a hood of living ivy. They place a hand on your shoulder, and suddenly the orb flares to life. The forest inside erupts in bioluminescent bloom, trees stretching upward into impossible geometries, rivers flooding with molten opal. The critics recoil as the light spills out, their masks cracking, their thrones unraveling into vines.  

“You mistake fragility for weakness,” the cloaked figure intones, their voice a chorus of wind through autumn leaves. “What is true is never broken. It only *transforms*.”  

The orb shatters—but not with violence. It dissolves into a swarm of iridescent moths, each carrying a shard of the forest, a flicker of starlight, and they spiral upward into the nebula above, stitching the holes in the sky with threads of gold. The critics are gone now, their seats empty. Only you and the moth-cloaked guide remain, standing in a hall that’s melting into a meadow, the air sweet with the scent of burning violets.  

You wake with salt on your lips and the echo of wings in your ears.
