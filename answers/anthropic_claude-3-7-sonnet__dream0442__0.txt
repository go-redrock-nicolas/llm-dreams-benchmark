I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the threshold between two worlds. The air shimmers with a quality I've never experienced while awake—it feels textured, as though I could run my fingers through the atmosphere and feel its varied densities. Sounds arrive not just at my ears but against my skin, creating ripples of sensation across my body.

I walk through a forest where trees breathe visibly, their bark undulating with slow, deliberate inhales and exhales. Their roots glow with bioluminescent networks that pulse information beneath the soil in complex patterns. I understand, somehow, that I'm witnessing their communication—ancient conversations translated into light.

The sky above isn't simply blue but a canvas of colors that don't exist in waking life—hues that seem to occupy spaces between familiar colors, that make my mind stretch to comprehend them. Clouds form not just shapes but intricate mathematical equations that solve themselves as they drift.

I encounter a river that flows both forward and backward simultaneously. When I dip my hand into it, memories that aren't mine flood my consciousness—a child's first steps in medieval France, an old woman watching spacecraft leave Earth for the last time, civilizations rising and falling in the span of heartbeats.

In the distance, mountains fold and unfold like origami, revealing hidden valleys where time runs at different speeds. Birds fly in formations that spell out poetry in ancient languages I somehow understand despite never having learned them.

This heightened perception feels like a gift, a secret layer of reality that's always been there, just beyond my normal senses. Every blade of grass, every particle of dust contains universes of meaning, speaking directly to some deeper part of my consciousness.

As I continue walking, I realize I'm leaving glowing footprints that transform into small gardens of impossible flowers behind me, each one containing a different possible future.
