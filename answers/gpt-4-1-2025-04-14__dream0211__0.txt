I am dreaming. stand at the edge of a swirling, iridescent amphitheater, its arches made of liquid glass and its floors pulsing with the color and rhythm of a thousand thoughts unspoken. Around me, an audience of faceless figures stretches upwards into infinity, each shifting and shimmering like the surface of memory—even their shadows seem to whisper warnings as I draw a deep, trembling breath.

In the center of the stage rests my creation: a living tapestry woven from strands of invisible truth. It undulates, shape-shifting between forms—sometimes a mirror that shows each onlooker their unfiltered self, other times a pulsing heart that echoes humanity’s most secret dreams and darkest dreads. With every transformation, I sense the crowd’s tension crackling, smelling like lightning on the verge of release.

As the unveiling nears, the room grows impossibly silent. I realize that what I am about to show will shatter comfortable illusions, peel away the cherished myths clinging to their collective souls. My heart ricochets inside my chest, heavy with the weight of my own doubt and the anticipation of a world forced to see itself reborn.

The moment arrives. With trembling hands, I loosen the final veil. The tapestry blossoms open, casting a surreal, iridescent light over the auditorium. The reflections are raw—some see kindness as weakness, others see love stripped of all transaction, while a few recoil at ugly truths long suppressed beneath silken words. Gasps, laughter, and cries ripple through the throng. I can taste their outrage—bitter as wormwood—but also the fresh, bracing wind of possibility.

As the faceless figures debate and rage, some hurl curses, some weep, and a few stand motionless, transfixed by the revelation. Through it all, I remain in the blinding center, the storm of controversy swelling around me, yet somehow, I am deeply at peace—knowing I have placed before the world not what it wished to see, but what it needed to confront.

The dream’s colors intensify, the amphitheater fracturing into endless kaleidoscopic patterns. Even as criticism rains down, I watch tiny seeds of transformation take root in the minds willing to see. In this liminal, luminous moment, with the tapestry reflecting infinite possibility, I understand: true creation is not to comfort, but to awaken.
