I am dreaming.

I find myself strolling through a luminous garden that seems to float above the clouds, its colors impossibly vivid—roses the size of my hands, petals shimmering with iridescent light, the air alive with the scent of jasmine and honey. There is a gentle hum, the sound of laughter and warmth, weaving through the leaves as beams of golden sunlight flicker between the branches.  

Suddenly, in the heart of this radiant garden, I stop, entranced. I witness a scene of extraordinary kindness: a being of silver light—neither fully human nor wholly spirit—kneels beside a trembling, injured bird. With hands glowing softly, the figure cups the frightened creature, whispering words that feel like a gentle summer rain on my skin. Instantly, the bird's wounds close as if they had never been, and it takes flight, dipping and soaring, painting joy across the rosy sky. The gentle being gazes after it, a tear—half liquid starlight, half gladness—gliding down their cheek.

Watching this act of profound compassion, something stirs within me—a deep, luminous resolve. I walk deeper into the garden and come across another traveler: a child lost and weeping beneath a vine of golden bells. Remembering the silver being’s gentle care, I kneel and open my arms. Without hesitation, the child rushes into my embrace. I offer soothing words, recalling those spoken to the wounded bird, and the melody of kindness weaves around us like a gentle breeze. The garden itself seems to lean in, the flowers singing a soft lullaby of reassurance.

Inspired by this moral exemplar, I find myself changed. Everywhere I go in this dream, my touch brings comfort—the lonely blossom is joined by companions, the weeping willow straightens, the path smooths for those who stumble. Acts of care, even the smallest ones, ripple outward. The sky blooms with the colors of kindness, and I know, with the certainty only found in dreams, that every gentle gesture is a seed from which miracles may grow.

I wake with my heart aglow, carrying the warmth of that celestial garden into the waking world, determined to be a bearer of compassion, as I witnessed in the deepest parts of imagination.
