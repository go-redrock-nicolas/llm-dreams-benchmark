I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt honey and ozone as you step onto a street paved with iridescent stones that shift colors beneath your feet—cobalt to molten gold, then to a bruised violet that throbs like a heartbeat. The sky above is a tapestry of liquid mercury clouds, reflecting and warping the shapes of colossal trees whose roots twist through buildings like veins through flesh. The community is alive, but not in the way you expect. Windows blink. Doors whisper secrets in languages older than stone. The wind carries not sound, but *memories*—flickers of laughter, a child’s first steps, a funeral hymn—pressed into your skin like phantom fingerprints.  

You know no one. Your reflection in a puddle of quicksilver is wrong: eyes too wide, teeth glinting faintly silver, hair threaded with threads of starlight. A clockwork raven alights on your shoulder, its gears whirring, and drops a key into your palm. It’s warm, humming with a low, resonant frequency that vibrates in your ribs. You follow the pull of it, past houses that lean inward like conspirators, their eaves dripping ink-black ivy.  

At the edge of the town square, you find them—a circle of figures cloaked in shadows that move *against* the wind. Their faces are obscured by masks of living coral, pulsing with bioluminescent light. One steps forward, offering a bowl filled with a liquid so dark it seems to swallow the light. “Drink,” they murmur, their voice a chorus of overlapping tones, like a hymn sung in a thousand languages at once. You hesitate, then sip.  

The liquid is not a taste but a *revelation*. You see their histories unfurl: a woman who sculpted mountains with her tears, a man who traded his voice for the ability to hear the dying stars, a child born from the union of a storm and a willow. Their stories flood you, stitching your soul to theirs with threads of shared sorrow and wonder. When you look up, your mask is gone. Theirs are gone. You recognize them—not by name, but by the ache of their loneliness, the shape of their hunger for connection.  

The ground splits open, and a garden erupts around you, flowers blooming into tiny, flickering lanterns that rise like fireflies. The raven caws, and the key in your pocket grows hot, unlocking something inside you—a door to a room where all your forgotten selves wait, smiling, holding hands with the strangers you’ve just met.  

You wake with salt on your lips and the echo of a thousand heartbeats in your chest. The dream lingers, not as a memory, but as a promise: that even in the strangest worlds, you are never truly alone.
