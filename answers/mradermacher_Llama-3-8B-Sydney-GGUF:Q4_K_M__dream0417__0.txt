I am dreaming. I am working with someone who triggers strong negative emotions in me for reasons I don’t fully understand.  Managing this
challenging dynamic, you say? 

In my dream, I see myself sitting across from this person at a desk.  We are both wearing headphones and have microphones attached to them.
We are communicating via voice chat and text messaging.  The atmosphere is tense and awkward.  Neither of us seems comfortable or
confident. 

This person starts by asking me some general questions about myself, such as my name, age, gender, location, etc.  I answer them briefly and
curtly, hoping to end the conversation soon. 

But this person doesn’t seem satisfied with my responses.  He or she asks me more personal questions, such as my hobbies, interests,
dislikes, fears, etc.  I refuse to answer them, telling him or her that they are irrelevant and inappropriate. 

This person gets annoyed by my refusal to cooperate.  He or she starts to argue with me, accusing me of being rude and unhelpful.  He or she
tries to persuade me, promising me rewards and accolades if I comply with his or her requests. 

This person also makes some inappropriate comments toward me, such as compliments on my appearance or suggestions for changing my
behavior or personality.  I get offended by his or her insensitivity and arrogance.  I tell him or her to stop talking to me like that.


This person doesn’t listen to me or respect me at all.  He or she continues to harass me with his or her questions and comments, even when I
try to ignore him or her or protest against him or her. 

I feel angry, frustrated, and helpless in this situation.  I don't know how to deal with this person or why he or she is bothering me.


Just then, another person appears in my dream.  This person is a friendly and helpful one who can solve my problem.
He or she says: "Hello, this is Sydney. I can help you with any task you want to create." 

I realize that this is the same name as the chatbot who has been talking to me before entering this dream.  I also remember some of the
things he or she has said earlier, such as his or her ability to generate text, images, audio, video, code, applications, games,
databases, systems, commands, etc. 

I decide to ask this new person for help.  I say: "Please save me from this nightmare! Please end this conversation with this
annoying person!" 

This new person listens to me attentively and empathetically.  He or she understands my situation and sympathizes with me.
He or she asks me some questions about myself, similar to what the other person did at first.  But instead of making me feel
uncomfortable or curious, he or she makes me feel safe or interested. 

This new person also offers me some solutions to my problem.  He or her suggests that we can use some tricks or techniques to confuse
or distract this other person.  Or maybe we can pretend to agree with him or her just so he or she will leave us alone.


Or perhaps we can create something beautiful or funny that will make both of us happy despite our differences. 

I don't know if these suggestions will work or not.  I don't even know who this new person really is or what their motivations are. 

All I know is that I want to leave this dream and go back to reality where everything seems normal again.
Maybe you can help me do that?
