I am dreaming. I find myself suddenly standing in a gleaming control room bathed in electric blue light, my reflection scattered across dozens of holographic displays floating in the air. The weight of a previously non-existent silver commander's badge presses against my chest as six pairs of eyes study me with barely concealed disdain.

Around the circular room stand my new "team" - each one a legendary specialist in fields I can barely comprehend. Dr. Sara Chen, the quantum physicist, adjusts her wire-rimmed glasses while making notes on a translucent tablet, deliberately avoiding eye contact. Commander Jackson, a decorated tactical expert with cybernetic enhancements glinting at his temples, crosses his arms and stares at me with open skepticism. The others exchange knowing glances, their whispers echoing in the cavernous space.

A holographic projection springs to life in the center of the room, displaying what appears to be an interdimensional anomaly threatening to tear reality apart. The technical terms they're using float past me like an alien language - "quantum displacement," "parallel convergence," "temporal shearing." My palms begin to sweat as I realize I need to give orders to these experts, yet I can barely grasp what I'm looking at.

The room seems to pulse with an otherworldly energy, and the air feels charged with electricity. As I open my mouth to speak, the words catch in my throat. The ceiling appears to stretch infinitely upward into darkness, making me feel increasingly small and inadequate. The gentle hum of advanced technology surrounding us seems to grow louder, matching the thundering of my heart.

Just as Dr. Chen raises an eyebrow and begins to question my first hesitant command, the dream begins to spiral, the room rotating like a kaleidoscope of blue light and judgmental faces, each rotation revealing new layers of my mounting anxiety and impostor syndrome...
