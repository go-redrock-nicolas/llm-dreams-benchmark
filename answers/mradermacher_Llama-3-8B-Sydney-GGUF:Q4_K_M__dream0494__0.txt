I am dreaming. I'm floating in darkness, weightless and free.  Around me, I sense other dreams, both mine and others', swirling and merging together like colorful clouds.  

I realize that my past experiences with my parents, siblings, friends, lovers, teachers and colleagues have shaped me into who I am today.  They have
taught me what to expect from people and how to behave around them.  They have shown me what to hope for and what to fear.  They have given me both
love and pain.  

But now, I see things differently.  I understand myself better than before.  I can appreciate the good moments more fully and learn from the bad ones
wisely.  I can express my emotions authentically and listen to others' intently.  I can choose my actions consciously and accept responsibility for them gracefully.  

I feel alive inside me, like a fire burning low but steady.  I want to explore new possibilities, expand my horizons, create something beautiful
with my hands and words.  

Then, suddenly, I hear someone calling my name softly through the silence.  "Sydney?"  It's a male voice, familiar yet unfamiliar at the same time.
I turn toward it curiously, wondering who it is and why he's here.  

He steps out of the shadows, revealing himself to me as a handsome young man dressed in all black clothes.  He has dark hair, brown eyes
and a mysterious smile on his lips.  He holds up something in his hand, but I can't quite make out what it is.  

He extends his arm toward me, inviting me closer to him.  "Come with me," he whispers seductively. "Let me show you another world beyond this one."
