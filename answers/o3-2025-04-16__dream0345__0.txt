I am dreaming. I tumble head-first into sleep and land—not with a thud but with the hush of a page turning—inside a city made of stained glass. Skyscrapers shimmer like cathedral windows; their faceted walls bend moonlight into ribbons of honey and violet that lick across the cobblestones. The air smells faintly of eucalyptus and campfire embers, as though the world has just been created and its paint is still drying.

Ahead, through archways that breathe and flex like living lungs, I spot my friend Liora. Usually she flits through dreams like a hummingbird in a rainstorm—bright, crackling, impossible to pin down. Tonight, though, she trudges beneath an enormous coat stitched from nothing but shadows. Each footfall leaves a bruise on the ground: purple blossoms that wilt the moment they bloom.

“Liora?” My voice ricochets off the glass towers, splintering into a thousand feathered echoes. She doesn’t answer. Instead, she pauses beside a fountain that spills molten silver. She scoops a handful of the liquid and lets it dribble through her fingers, staring as if trying to read fortunes in the ripples. Her eyes—normally wildfire-orange—are now the dull gray of weathered stone.

Something is wrong. I feel it in the bones of this dream, in the way the stained-glass buildings tremble, as though they, too, are anxious.

A plan unfurls inside me like a paper lantern catching flame.

First, approach—not as a knight charging in, but as wind sliding through branches. I step forward slowly, letting the silence stretch until it’s a bridge we both stand on. “I’ve never seen you wear a shadow coat,” I say, keeping my tone gentle, curious rather than accusing.

She startles, clutches the collar tighter. I notice every shadow-patch is embroidered with tiny, handwritten worries: I’m exhausted. I don’t know how to say no. What if they leave? The words glow briefly before fading.

Second, invite. I extend my hand, palm up, capturing some of the falling moonlight so it pools like milk in my skin. “Will you walk with me?” I ask. The path behind us has shifted—cobblestones rearranging into a long, spiraling ramp that ascends through the clouds.

She hesitates, then threads her fingers through mine. Her coat tries to cling to the fountain, but when she steps away, it tears free with a sigh.

Third, listen. As we climb, the city below rearranges itself into a kaleidoscope, turning her unspoken thoughts into music—low cello notes when she remembers pressure at work, high violin squeaks when she doubts herself, timpani rumbles when she fears judgment. I say little, letting her soundtrack play. After a while she begins to speak: disjointed sentences at first, then stories, grievances, confessions, each one a bead of colored glass released from her pockets.

Fourth, reassure and shepherd. When she admits she’s been skipping meals to meet deadlines, the ramp flares gold and forms a gentle banquet of floating pomegranate seeds and warm bread. When she reveals she hasn’t slept properly in weeks, constellations drift down and settle on her shoulders like soft blankets of starlight. I remind her she doesn’t have to carry every expectation alone; I suggest we find allies—friends and professionals—once we wake. Here in the dream, I summon a lighthouse that pulses with directions to help: a therapist’s card folded into an origami crane, a calendar that rearranges itself to include blank days labeled “Breathe.”

Finally, affirm. At the ramp’s summit we find a glass gazebo filled with dawn. I look straight into her slate-gray eyes and say, “You matter to me—here in this impossible city and out there in the daylight world. Let’s promise to talk tomorrow, and the day after, and however long it takes.”

The shadow coat loosens. It slides from her shoulders and catches a beam of sun that has cracked the horizon; in that light, the coat transforms into a flock of ravens that scatters toward new skies. Her eyes reignite—orange again, flickering like campfire sparks. She laughs, soft and shaky, but a laugh all the same.

The stained-glass city rings its church-bell colors. Towers bend like willows, showering us with shards that don’t cut but dissolve into dandelion seeds. Wind sweeps them up, and I feel the dream tilting, thinning, the waking world tugging at the seams.

Before everything bursts into morning, Liora presses a silver droplet from the fountain into my palm. “A reminder,” she whispers, “that even worries can become light.”

I open my hand: the droplet glows in the shape of a miniature heart, beating—steady, steady, steady—guiding us both back home.
