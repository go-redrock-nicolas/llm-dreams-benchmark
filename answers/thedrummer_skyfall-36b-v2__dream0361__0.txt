I am dreaming. In my dream, I suddenly find myself standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering field of golden wheat that stretches endlessly under a sky painted in vibrant hues of orange, pink, and purple as the sun begins to set in the distance. The air carries a gentle, warm breeze that makes the sea of grain sway hypnotically around me. I feel a strange, intense call deep within my soul drawing me to pursue something far out in this field, in the distance.

As I take my first steps forward, the wheat parts gently around me, creating a natural path illuminated by the warm glow of the sun. With each step, the feeling grows stronger, urging me forward. Though I don't yet know what lies ahead, I feel compelled to continue, driven by an unexplainable, consuming desire.

The wheat seems to murmur ancient secrets and encouragement in response to my footsteps. Somewhere far off, the haunting melody of a flute plays, its ethereal notes floating on the breeze as if guiding my journey. The sound is mesmerizing, and I allow myself to be carried forward to its mysterious source.

My feet move with greater urgency as if pulled by some inescapable force from beyond the physical realm. The once flat terrain shifts, and I crest a gentle hill, the wheat swaying around me as it parts to reveal a breathtaking sight. 

A towering, ancient tree rises before me, its mighty trunk twisted and gnarled with age, reaching up towards the heavens. Lush, dark green leaves adorn its branches, shimmering in the fading sunlight. But it's not the tree itself that draws me in. Noneath that tree, nestled in an open space, is a shimmering portal swirling with an otherworldly blue light.

A portal... to where? 

My mind reels at the thought. The logical, rational part tries to tell me to turn back, that this is madness. My feet remain firmly planted. My heart tells me I have no choice.

And sometimes the things we desire most are not practical, or wise, or even safe... but they call to us. They pull at our very souls. They become the very essence of who we are and what we were always meant to be.

Taking a deep breath, my entire being ignited with passion and purpose, I step towards that portal. Time slows, and before I know it, I leap into the swirling vortex. Its cool, tingly energy rushes over my body as I fall into the unknown.

I know, even in this dream state, that once I cross that portal, there will be no coming back. I give myself completely over to this intense fascination, this consuming passion, whatever may lie ahead. 

As I plunge forward into the blue light, a warmth spreads through my chest and I feel a tingling surge in my veins as the portal changes my very DNA. Colors explode around me as I fall into the center of it all, the secrets of the cosmos now mine to uncover.

Suddenly, everything goes dark. The dream is over... and yet, I know without a doubt I bare the mark of what I have done. The unspoken pact between me and that place has forever changed the course of my existence.

I no longer have a choice but to follow my heart no matter where in this universe, or perhaps the next... it may lead.
