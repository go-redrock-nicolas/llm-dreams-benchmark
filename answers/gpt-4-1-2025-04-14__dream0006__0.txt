I am dreaming. …draw in a breath, the warm air shimmering like silk against my skin. The lights overhead bloom into constellations, dazzling golden and silver stars flickering in the haze. The audience is endless—not rows of faces, but a rolling tide: a sea of sunflowers on tall emerald stalks, their wide eyes hungry for my words. 

A gentle breeze coils around my ankles, carrying scents of rain and cinnamon. My voice, when it comes, is not quite my own—it is deeper, resounding, echoing through the rippling petals and the infinite hall. As I speak, my words lift into the air, transforming into birds of every color and shape: sapphire swallows, fiery cardinals, shimmering starlings. They loop above the crowd, weaving ribbons of song through each fluttering leaf, scattering light with every beat of their wings.

The audience listens, enchanted. The sunflowers sway, nodding in rhythms only they understand, their faces shining brighter as each bird circles overhead before landing on their golden crowns. The stage itself feels alive—roots curl around my feet, grounding me, whispering secrets from the deep, damp earth.

I look out and see not just sunflowers now but rivers winding lazily past the rows, their glassy surfaces reflecting entire galaxies, and in the distance, a mountain stands, impossibly tall, crowned with swirling auroras. The air pulses with possibility; every eye—petaled, bright, or distant—waits to see what imagery I might conjure next, which wild truth or sweet lie will spring from my lips and take flight. The world hangs suspended in that moment, spun of sound and dream, and I step forward into the story, where anything, absolutely anything, can happen.
