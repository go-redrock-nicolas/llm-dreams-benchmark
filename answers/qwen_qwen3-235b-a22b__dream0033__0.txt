I am dreaming. A thick shroud of sleep hovers over me, blissfully weightless yet tangled in a world that is anything but.  The forgotten scent of ancient incense curls through the air – sharp and resinous, like old prayers caught in the dust.  I walk alone down the corridor of an ancient temple, swallowed by shadows stretched too long by the flickering light that reflects off carvings older than memory itself.  The walls weep with time; moss creeps like ivy along chiseled figures, half-erased by erosion and neglect.  The silence is deep, sacred and sinister, vibrating with secrets I don't yet understand.

The air grows heavy, a dense velvet pressing against my skin. I don’t notice at first – but then the ground beneath me shifts, subtly.  My steps falter as the stone beneath my feet sighs, then shivers.  A moment later, with a sound like a mountain clearing its throat, the floor gives way.  One step towards the light of a mural too faded to see – and then the fall.

Darkness swallows me whole.  I tumble into the waiting earth like a seed cast into tomb-black soil.  My world becomes blunt edges and sudden weight. There is pain, although it feels distant, softened by the surreal texture of dreams.  For a time, there is nothing but the echoing crash above me, the settling of debris. The air thickens with age-old dust, and then – silence.

I am in a chamber that feels alive.  My breath echoes louder than sound, a rhythmic chant in the stillness. The chamber pulses faintly, its walls encased with veins of something soft and bioluminescent. The walls seem to breathe, slow like the rise and fall of some ancient creature. The air, though hot and thin, carries the metallic sweetness of rust and my own racing heartbeat. Oxygen trickles away like filtered moonlight, vanishing through invisible cracks.

A way out.  That’s all that matters now. My eyes adjust to the unearthly glow. The chamber is cluttered with strange tapestries, woven not of threads, but of hair—human hair braided with bone fragments and wisdom teeth.  Strange altars float against the walls, covered in stones that don't look like stones at all; they pulse faintly with life, (or the illusion of it) and whisper as I pass.

There is no door. No stairs. No trick of light that promises escape.

But then I see it. A faint light—from where?—a crevice in the wall about ten feet above the ground. Too high. Impossible without a way to reach it.

Wait… and there, directly beneath the crevice, lies what remains of an eradicated civilization. Scattered relics —half-buried treasures -- glimmer feebly, indifferent to the passage of eons. An obsidian mirror cracked at the edges hungers for reflection no longer offered. Scrolls float like ghosts over the cracks in the flooring, untouched by decay.  They burn at the edges with a cold flame that hisses but does not devour.

As I wander through the strange remnants—contemptuous moans of ancestors trapped within the walls echo and swell—I find a climbing rope made not of ropes but of woven memories. It slithers and coils in my hands like a serpent finding a familiar limb.  I hear the words then, spoken not aloud but directly into the marrow of my being:

*"The path comes alive only when you dare to cross it."*

I look up. The faint light still seems out of reach, but suddenly the air feels thinner, the chamber shrinking around me. My limbs grow heavy, but the rope pulses with energy in my grip. An illusion? A test?

Not daring to second-guess, I throw the rope up and dare the unknown. Each climb is a weight of history, but my body moves with purpose, instinct guiding my trembling hands and aching limbs upward.

The chamber narrows around me, the walls becoming deeper shadows that murmur secrets I cannot yet comprehend.  Halfway up, I realize I am not alone. Eyes watch me. A knowing presence. unseen but felt. It could be the ghosts of those long forgotten or simply the pretense of oxygen withdrawal, but I climb because the voice is louder —insistent, urging.

And then, a sliver of the unknown world above.  The air becomes brighter, even as pain screams in my ribs, my lungs starved of what they need.  But I'm not done. Not yet.

For above me waits more than just escape.

There is revelation. A treasure perhaps better left untouched. An epiphany spread across the veil of the dream.  The rope still coils around my limbs, alive and expectant.

What happens next?  That is the question.  The dreamer will decide, but not without consequence.

Something ancient waits in the light above the crevice.  I can feel it holding its breath, ready to pull me into a world where time folds in on itself and where truth tastes like sweet rot.

The climb continues. The dream deepens. And the whisper fades into a HABIT: *"You broke into the heart of the forgotten. Now live with what it gives you."*
