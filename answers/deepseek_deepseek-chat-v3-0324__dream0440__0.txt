I am dreaming. The world around me is drenched in twilight hues, where violet and indigo bleed into ribbons of liquid gold just beyond the horizon. I stand at the edge of a vast, obsidian lake, its surface so still it might be polished glass—until I notice it. Ripples. They begin as faint disturbances near the center, then spiral outward in hypnotic pulses. My breath catches as the water begins to *shift*, not just ripple, but *rearrange itself*, as if the lake is breathing in time with my own heartbeat.  

Then, beneath the surface, I see them—shadows of my younger selves, flickering like projections on the water. There’s the child clutching a frayed stuffed rabbit, whispering, *"Don’t ask for too much, or they’ll leave."* The teenage version of me, shoulders hunched under an invisible weight, scribbling in a journal, *"Love is earned, not given."* Each reflection is a frozen moment, a rule etched into my bones without my consent.  

A warmth blooms in my chest—something new, something fierce. I reach into the water, but instead of cold, my fingers meet resistance, as if the surface has turned to honey. I push through, and the lake *sings*, a low, resonant hum that vibrates through my ribs. The rules—those old, rusted chains—begin to dissolve, letters unraveling like ink in water.  

Then, the impossible: my hand closes around something solid. I pull, and the lake parts like a curtain, revealing a door. Not just any door—it’s carved with symbols that shift when I blink (a key, a flame, an unbroken circle). The knob turns on its own.  

Beyond it? A garden where the air shimmers with fireflies, each one a tiny, pulsing *"what if?"* What if I am worthy without proof? What if joy is not a reward but a birthright? The old rules try to whisper, but the wind carries their voices away. I step through.  

The door snaps shut behind me. The lake is gone. And I am running—no, *flying*—through the grass, laughing, because the rules here are written in my own hand.  

(Then I wake, but the taste of that garden lingers, sweet and stubborn as a sugar cube melting under the tongue.)
