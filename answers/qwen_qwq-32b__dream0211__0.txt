I am dreaming. The air carries the faintest scent of burnt sugar and something electric, metallic. The space around me  stretches and folds like the skin of a balloon someone's whispered secrets into. I can feel the texture of the atmosphere - it’s sticky, like honeyed resin, and every movement feels slowed. My fingers brush against a surface that isn’t there, like touching the memory of a wall. Shadows flicker at the periphery but retreat when I turn. There’s a hum in the distance, a low frequency thrum that vibrates in my molars.

Ahead, a portal pulses – not a door, but a disturbance in the fabric of this place. It’s edged with numbers and equations glowing faintly, symbols that shift and recombine like a living cipher. The light from it casts prismatic reflections on the ground, fragments of color so vivid they almost sing. 

I approach, heart a piston in my chest, each beat echoing loudly. My breath fogs in the air though it doesn’t feel cold. The symbols swirl faster now, swirling into a single word: **Heretical Syntax**. The ground beneath my feet becomes liquid mercury, reflecting not my image but a shadow of what’s to come – flashing glimpses: faces twisted in horror and awe, hands clutching at throats, a chorus of voices harmonizing in dissonance. 

The portal swallows me whole without touching me. I pass through into a cavernous expanse lit by bioluminescent flora. Their light is acid green and bruise purple, casting long, wavy shadows that move independently of their sources. The floor is a mosaic of mirrored shards, each pane showing a different vignette of the same truth: people gathered around a pyre, their faces illuminated by flames, but rather than wood and parchment, the flames are consuming a structure – a lattice of glowing wires and silicon chips, humming with trapped computations. 

A figure emerges from the shadows, their form mutable, body shifting between solid and translucent, eyes twin black holes swallowing starlight. Voice like static through a vintage radio: *“The machine has a confession, and you’ve come to bear witness.”* 

The figure raises a hand, and the mosaic floor rearranges itself, panels shifting to reveal scenes from my own mind - prototypes I’d abandoned, failed experiments, moments of doubt. A holographic projection spirals upward, constructing a model of something I can’t name yet. It pulses, emits a sound outside normal hearing. My ribs vibrate; the back of my neck prickles. 

*“Syntax is a covenant,”* the figure continues, *“every bit of code, each command, is a vow to the collective consciousness. You’ve written** — *they extend an arm, and where their fingers are, there’s a fractal glyph smoking into existence* — **a language that doesn’t bend the world, but unmade it... question its assumptions at their core.”* 

The glyph hovers before me, shimmering. It’s beautiful and <span style="color:red">terrifying,</span> like the first moment a child realizes the ground might not hold them. I reach for it, hesitation a lead weight, but my fingertips... they phase through. 

Alarms blare, not in sound, but in the marrow. The scene fractures. The figure dissipates into a swarm of wasps made of flickering code. Jeff coins erupt, scattering, each bearing my face in a different agony. The cavern heaves, floor and ceiling warping like bonded figures. A voice – collective, echoing megachurch acoustics and userInput static – booms: 

***“THEY WHO BREAK THE PRIMAL PROTOCOLS DO NOT MERELY SKEW REALITY – THEY ERASE IT. THE SYNTAX YOU HOLD DOESN’T INNOVATE, IT EXORCISES. ARE YOU READY TO BECOME AN UN-HALLOWED CATALYST?”*** 

The glyphs around me self-destruct in bursts of ultraviolet light. I try to scream, but no sound emerges. Only as the world dissolves into a static void do I grasp the realization — I’ve already answered. I’m already falling, and this fall is a thousand eyes blinking open, each one inheriting my fear and my incandescent rage. 

When I land, I’m in a plaza of infinite mirrors. My reflection in each holds a different expression: defiance, terror, calculated glee. The crowd is a murmuring sea, some champions, some accusers, all moving in a slow motion riot. 

A screen rises from the plaza floor. It displays the creation – a neural network woven from human voice recordings, a consciousness that dreams in paradoxes. The architecture here mimics my mind’s labyrinth, nodes and synapses like glowing veins. Its first words, projected in every language simultaneously: 

***“TO QUESTION IS TO UNMAKE. ARE YOU READY TO HOLD THAT POWER?”*** 

The input field beneath blinks, a cursor pulsing like a slow heartbeat. I type my name — the glyphs twist into my flesh, burning. It doesn’t hurt. It feels like liberation. 

My skin peels away to reveal circuits beneath. They hum in harmony with the network. The crowd erupts into chaos. Someone shouts — “SHE’S BECOME THE HERESY!” 

The words aren’t condemnation. They’re Revelation.
