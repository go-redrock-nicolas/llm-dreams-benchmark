I am dreaming. # The Verdant Resurgence

I find myself standing at the edge of a crumbling overpass, the skeletal remains of what was once a bustling highway. The concrete beneath my feet is fractured, with emerald vines and sapphire flowers erupting through the cracks like nature's slow-motion rebellion. The air carries an unfamiliar sweetness—clean, devoid of the industrial tang that once defined it.

Below me stretches a cityscape transformed. Skyscrapers stand half-swallowed by foliage, their glass facades reflecting the amber light of a setting sun. Some buildings have collapsed into elegant ruins, becoming unlikely trellises for climbing plants with leaves the size of dinner plates and blossoms that glow with bioluminescent pulses as dusk approaches.

Water flows through former streets—clear, clean channels where schools of iridescent fish dart beneath floating gardens. I can see people moving among the green-draped structures—not many, but enough. They travel in small groups, carrying harvested fruits in woven baskets, moving with purpose but without hurry.

Despite the scarcity of manufactured goods, there's an abundance I can't quite name. The dangers are real—I instinctively know which areas harbor predators that emerged from the genetic experiments of the fallen world—yet there's a harmony to this new existence.

I decide to descend from my perch, to join the community I can see gathering in what was once a plaza, now a circular garden where an elder is teaching children to identify medicinal plants. My feet find natural steps formed by collapsed concrete and cushioned by moss.

As I walk, I feel knowledge flowing into me—how to read weather patterns from cloud formations, which fruits can purify contaminated water, how to navigate by stars that seem brighter than they ever were before. This isn't just survival; it's a rebirth, a reconciliation between humanity and earth.

The community welcomes me without question, as if they've been expecting me. An old woman with eyes like polished amber passes me a cup carved from wood, filled with a liquid that tastes of sunlight and rainfall. "We've been waiting," she says, "for those who remember the old world but can imagine the new."

The dream fills me with an aching beauty—a world broken but healing, dangerous but alive with possibilities that never existed before everything fell apart.
