I am dreaming. I am standing in the heart of a city I don’t recognize—narrow streets woven like ancient veins, stone buildings towering on either side, their facades cracked with time. The air smells of burning incense and distant smoke, a blend of sandalwood and something acrid, something unrestful. The language around me is a river of unfamiliar tones, words slipping past my comprehension like fish darting through dark water.  

Then—a sound, sharp and hollow, echoing down the alleyways. A gunshot? A firework? The atmosphere shifts instantly. Voices rise, knots of people scatter like spooked birds. I see a shopkeeper rolling down a metal grate; a child clings to his mother’s leg as she hurries them both inside. My heart thunders in my chest, a drumbeat of panic.  

I turn a corner and find the streets barricaded—burning trash cans, debris piled like jagged teeth. A radio somewhere warbles a frantic broadcast in a language I don’t know, but the urgency needs no translation. Borders closed. Military presence. No way out.  

And then—I look up.  

The sky is turning. Not metaphorically, not just the mood—the very fabric of the heavens is twisting. Clouds spiral inward, forming a vortex of deep violet and bruise-black. A low hum trembles through the air, shaking the cobblestones beneath my feet. The fleeing people don’t seem to notice; they’re still rushing, still screaming about checkpoints and curfews.  

But I see it.  

And within that swirling sky, something is peering *down*.  

Not a face, not eyes, but an awareness—an immense, depthless gaze pressing against the world. The humming grows louder, and for a breathless second, I understand. The unrest, the fear—it’s not just politics, not just human chaos.  

It’s an invitation.  

The city trembles. The vortex deepens. And then—  

I wake up.  

My sheets are damp with sweat. The hum still lingers in my ears, or maybe it’s just the blood rushing. Either way, I know—somewhere—that sky is still turning.
