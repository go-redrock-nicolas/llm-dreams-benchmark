I am dreaming. I’m standing in the middle of a crowded plaza, surrounded by thousands of people here for some festival or rally. There’s music playing, bright lights, banners fluttering in the breeze... and then everything changes.

Suddenly, the ground beneath me begins to tremble. A deep, resonant groan echoes from below, and the crowd erupts into screams. Overhead, the sky splits open like a cracked eggshell, and molten gold light pours down from a colossal portal tearing reality itself. The air smells of ozone and burnt sugar, and the screech of otherworldly energy is deafening. I stumble back as the first tendrils of iridescent mist snake down from the rift, coiling around my ankles.

But then—strangely—I notice that instead of freezing with fear, my body feels… lighter. The crowd’s panic seems to slow, their movements blurring like smoke. A humming sensation thrums in my fingertips. I wave a hand, and the mist parts, revealing a glowing sigil on my palm I’ve never seen before.  

The portal above yawns wider, and now I can see it: a massive, many-armed entity clawing its way through, its skin shifting like liquid mercury. Its eyes lock onto me, and I scream—not from fear, but recognition. It’s my grandmother’s face, but stretched across a tentacle, eyes black as abyssal voids. Her face twists, and a voice that’s both raspy and electronically distorted booms, *“You shouldn’t have opened this… but you *will* close it.”*  

I don’t remember opening anything, but I know she’s right. The crowd is now frozen, meringue statues mid-scream. I run—feel the cobblestones cool under my shoes even as the air heats to impossible temperatures—and the world folds like origami, teleporting me to the base of the portal.  

Now I understand. The sigil on my hand glows brighter, and I reach up to grasp one of the creature’s tentacles. The contact feels like kissing something both entirely familiar and completely alien. My grandmother’s voice whispers in my mind, *“The cost is yours to bear.”*  

I don’t resist when her my memories, my name forgotten, my friends reduced to silhouettes. But there’s a key in the moment—the sigil pulses as I press it to the entity’s core.  

A sound like shattering glass. The sky seals itself, the portal screaming as it collapses. When the light fades, the plaza is silent. The statues thaw, shaking themselves awake—none remember the chaos, none know what I’ve done or who I’ve been.  

As I wake—exhausted, my body ache with phantom burns—my palm still tingles. And tucked in my dream-jacket’s pocket lies a single obsidian pebble, warm and heavy.  

Maybe it’s a fragment of the gate. Or a promise.  

Either way, the next time the sky cracks, I’ll remember how to seal it.
