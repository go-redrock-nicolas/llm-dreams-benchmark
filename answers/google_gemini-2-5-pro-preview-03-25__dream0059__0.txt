I am dreaming. What was that? Was that an earthquake? Where am I? This doesn't look like my bedroom... Oh, wait, it is. It's just that my clock radio is on the floor, and there's a large crack in the ceiling that wasn't there yesterday. Is it morning? It must be because I see sunlight peeking through the curtains. I reach over to turn on the lamp beside my bed, but nothing happens. That's odd. Maybe the bulb burnt out.

I get out of bed and head toward the bathroom. I flip the light switch, but again, nothing happens. Strange. I guess the power must be out. That would explain why the clock radio isn't working. I look out the window and see people gathering in the street below. They look confused and concerned. Some are pointing up at the sky, while others are talking animatedly amongst themselves.

I quickly get dressed and head downstairs. As I pass the kitchen, I notice that the microwave clock is blank, and the refrigerator isn't humming its usual tune. This power outage must be widespread. I step outside onto the porch and join the growing crowd. Everyone is speculating about what might have happened. Some think it was a massive solar flare, others suspect a coordinated cyberattack, and a few whisper about more fantastical possibilities.

Days turn into weeks, and the initial confusion gives way to a stark new reality. Without electricity, the intricate web of modern society begins to unravel. Cars sit idle, their electronic ignitions useless. Communication systems are down, cutting off contact with the outside world. The conveniences we once took for granted – running water, refrigeration, instant information – are suddenly gone.

The city transforms. The constant hum of traffic is replaced by the murmur of voices, the clatter of horse-drawn carts, and the crackling of campfires. People adapt, rediscovering old skills and forming tighter communities. Bartering becomes the primary mode of exchange, with food, water, and essential supplies taking precedence over money. Libraries become centers of knowledge once more, their dusty volumes holding the wisdom of generations past.

Evenings are spent gathered around fires, sharing stories and singing songs under a canopy of stars unobscured by city lights. The night sky is a breathtaking spectacle, more brilliant and awe-inspiring than I ever imagined. There's a newfound sense of connection, both to each other and to the natural world. Life is harder, undoubtedly, but it's also simpler, more tangible.

Yet, challenges remain. Maintaining order without established authority is difficult. Scarcity breeds tension, and not everyone adapts peacefully to the new way of life. There are those who seek to exploit the situation, preying on the vulnerable. We learn to be vigilant, to protect ourselves and our neighbors. We rediscover the importance of cooperation and resilience.

In this transformed world, I find a new sense of purpose. I join a group dedicated to preserving knowledge, helping to copy books by hand and teachchildren the skills they'll need to thrive. We cultivate gardens, learn herbal remedies, and rebuild structures using traditional techniques. It's demanding work, but incredibly rewarding.

As I drift deeper into this dream, I witness the emergence of a different kind of society – one less reliant on fragile technology and more attuned to the rhythms of nature and the strength of human connection. It's a world both challenging and beautiful, a stark reminder of what we've lost and what we might regain. The sun warms my face, the scent of woodsmoke fills the air, and the sounds of a rebuilding community surround me. This strange, unplugged world feels, in its own way, incredibly alive.**I am dreaming.**

The silence woke me first. Not a peaceful, slumbering silence, but a heavy, unnerving stillness that pressed in on my ears. Then came the tremor – a low, groaning vibration that rattled the windowpanes and sent a spiderweb crack racing across my bedroom ceiling like sudden lightning. My heart hammered against my ribs. Earthquake? I fumbled for the lamp on my nightstand, my fingers closing around the familiar switch. Click. Nothing. The persistent pre-dawn gloom remained absolute. Confused, I reached for my phone, its screen usually a beacon in the dark. Lifeless. Utterly black and unresponsive, cold metal in my palm.

Panic, cold and sharp, pricked at the edges of my mind. I stumbled out of bed, the floorboards strangely cold beneath my feet – the underfloor heating, another casualty. In the hallway, I slapped at the light switch. Again, nothing. The digital thermostat on the wall was a blank, accusing eye. It wasn't just a bulb, not just my phone. It was everything.

Throwing open the heavy curtains, I peered out into the street. Dawn was breaking, painting the sky in bruised purples and reluctant oranges, but the usual awakening hum of the city was absent. No distant traffic rumble, no early morning delivery trucks, no awakening electronic buzz. Instead, neighbours were creeping out of their houses, faces pale and bewildered in the nascent light. Figures clustered in small, anxious knots, voices low murmurs that barely carried. Phones were held aloft, uselessly scanning for signals that weren't there. Cars sat stubbornly silent at the curbsides, their drivers trying ignitions that wouldn't catch, engines that wouldn't turn over. The world had fallen quiet, holding its breath.

Days bled into weeks with a surreal, sluggish pace. The initial hope for a quick fix, a return to normalcy, slowly withered under the relentless silence of our technology. Without electricity, the intricate scaffolding of modern life collapsed inwards. Supermarket shelves emptied with terrifying speed, their freezers thawing, their electronic tills useless. Water stopped flowing reliably from taps. Information became a currency more precious than gold, whispered rumors passed mouth-to-mouth, snippets gleaned from battery-powered radios that crackled feebly before dying out.

The city, my vibrant, noisy city, transformed into something ancient, almost primal. The air cleared, losing its acrid metallic tang, replaced by the scent of woodsmoke as cooking fires dotted gardens and balconies. The relentless roar of traffic faded into memory, superseded by the rhythmic clip-clop of the occasional horse-drawn cart resurrected from some forgotten barn, the scrape of bicycles, and the constant susurrus of human voices – talking, bartering, arguing, singing. Greenery, unchecked, began to soften the concrete edges, reclaiming territory with surprising tenacity.

We adapted because we had to. Skills our grandparents knew became vital: cultivating small patches of earth for food, purifying water, mending clothes until they were mosaics of patches, navigating by the sun and stars. Libraries, once quiet havens, became bustling centres of rediscovered knowledge, their paper pages holding the keys to survival. Community notice boards, actual cork and paper boards, sprung up, covered in handwritten notes seeking lost loved ones, offering goods for trade, or organizing neighbourhood watches.

Evenings took on a different quality. Without the lure of screens, people gathered. Faces illuminated by the flickering dance of campfires replaced the blue glow of televisions. Stories were told, old songs sung, instruments hesitantly plucked. Looking up, the night sky was a revelation – an impossibly deep velvet canvas strewn with diamonds, the Milky Way a luminous river flowing across the heavens, more vivid and awe-inspiring than any planetarium projection. There was hardship, undeniably. Fear was a constant companion, scarcity gnawed at frayed nerves, and the darker aspects of human nature sometimes surfaced in desperation. Maintaining order was a fragile, ongoing effort.

Yet, in the midst of this upheaval, I found a strange sense of belonging, a purpose I hadn't known I lacked. I worked with others in a community garden, the feel of soil under my fingernails grounding me in a way screens never could. I helped organize the sharing of resources, mediated disputes, read aloud to children from worn paperbacks in the lengthening twilight. Life was stripped bare, reduced to essentials: warmth, food, water, shelter, connection. It was harder, yes, infinitely harder, but it felt startlingly real.

The dream surrounds me now, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, the murmur of communal life, the vast, silent presence of the star-drenched sky. It's a world unplugged, terrifying and beautiful, a stark landscape carved from the absence of what we once deemed essential, yet vibrantly alive with the resilience of the human spirit. And though it's a dream, the cool breeze on my face feels utterly, undeniably real.
