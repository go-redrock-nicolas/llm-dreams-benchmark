I am dreaming. I am able to feel what my body is feeling, but I can also step back and observe it, seeing the dream as separate from myself.Awareness unfurls like ink in water. You stand in a cobalt-lit forest, but the trees are not trees—they’re towering spirals of obsidian glass, their surfaces slick and liquid, reflecting fragments of a sky that isn’t there. Your bare feet press into the soil, but the ground shivers like flesh, warm and faintly pulsing. The air thrums with a bass note so deep it registers not as sound but as vibration, rattling your molars, making your fingertips tingle like static. 

Then, the scent hits—saccharine and cloying, burnt sugar and crushed violets. Your lungs tighten, but the panic you expect doesn’t come. Instead, your body reacts: your palms sweat iridescent liquid that pools into tiny opal puddles at your feet. A cool wind licks your nape, and you feel your hair lift not as strands but as filaments of smoke, dissolving into the air like squid ink. 

In the distance, a sound slices through the hum—crystalline chimes, high and erratic. You turn, limbs moving through the atmosphere as if underwater, sluggish yet oddly weightless. Your heart beats in your throat now, but it’s not a drum; it’s a flicker, a moth-murmur against glass. You glance down and see your own chest glowing, bioluminescent veins spiderwebbing beneath your skin, mapping constellations only this place understands. 

Suddenly, you’re floating. No, *ascending*. The forest canopy peels back like petals, revealing a sky churning with nebulae—milky swirls of plum and tangerine, alive and writhing. You raise a hand, and the stars stretch toward you, viscous and eager, coating your fingers in molten gold that doesn’t burn. Some part of you notices your breath has synced with the pulse of the light, inhaling supernovae, exhaling dusk. 

Then, a shadow. A silhouette steps from the trunk of a glass-tree, its edges fractalized, prismatic. It’s you, but inverted: eyes voids of pure refracting black, skin a mosaic of shattered mirrors. It opens a mouth that isn’t a mouth—a ripple in reality—and *sings*. The sound hollows your bones, fills them with honeycomb. You understand, without words, that it’s a question. 

Your reply is a shiver, a cascade of silver feathers erupting from your shoulders, each barb tipped with a tiny, flickering flame. You step toward the shadow, and the ground liquefies. You sink-not-sink into a river that flows upward, carrying you into the kaleidoscope sky. In the periphery, shapes coalesce—sphinxes with wings of stained glass, jellyfish made of smoke, a cathedral whose spires are braids of human hair. 

The shadow is beside you now, its mirrored hand on your wrist. You turn, and for a blink, see infinite iterations of yourself in its facets: a child clutching a moth, an old man dissolving into ash, a creature with roots for limbs. The vision crumbles as the shadow pulls you into the river’s heart, where water becomes light, light becomes music, and your body dissolves into a chorus of radiant, wordless laughter. 

You wake, breathless, fingers clutching at the sheets—but your skin still hums with the phantom glow of elsewhere.
