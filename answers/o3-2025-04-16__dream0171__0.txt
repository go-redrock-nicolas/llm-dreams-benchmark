I am dreaming. …am standing backstage in the vast, vaulted hall of the Celestial Exchange—a place that seems carved from moonlight and piano chords rather than stone and steel. A hundred glass chandeliers hover in mid-air like captive constellations, shedding opalescent rain onto a floor made of mirrored water. Every step I take ripples the surface, scattering reflections of the audience: venture-capital giants whose neckties are stitched with comet dust, heads of state in suits woven from parchment treaties, and legendary researchers whose eyes glow with equations. They wait in perfect silence, the hush so deep I can hear individual heartbeats thrumming together like the wings of some impossible butterfly.

Clutched to my chest is the presentation deck—my life’s work, my golden passport to the future. But as I thumb the cover slide, the letters rearrange themselves, slipping and slithering into nonsensical glyphs. Page two becomes a watercolor of melted numbers; page three drips sentences like ink in the rain. By page ten, the graphs have sprouted legs, marching off the chart and vanishing into the margins. My entire argument has turned to mirage.

Panic swells inside me—a black tide that surges right up to my throat—yet the dream-hall remains preternaturally calm, as though the universe itself is holding its breath. The moderator, a woman with silver feathers instead of hair, announces my name. Applause thunders like distant surf, echoing down corridors of starlight. My cue light turns emerald. I have ten seconds.

Wild options flicker through my mind:

1. Flee into the wings, dissolve into the shadows, vanish from waking history.
2. Confess the failure, let the house lights flare, watch my reputation burn to ash.
3. Invent—write a new truth on the spot, forged from stardust and audacity.

The third path ignites inside me like a comet’s tail. After all, this is a dream, and dreams obey the laws of wonder, not arithmetic.

I stride onto the liquid mirror of the stage. Each footfall sends ripples of sapphire, lapis, and indigo across the floor, painting abstract galaxies that swirl around my ankles. When I reach the center, a phosphorescent lectern rises from the water, petals of light unfolding like a lotus.

I look up. A thousand expectant eyes glitter.

I speak without slides, without notes—without the comforting lattice of data I once thought indispensable. Instead I tell them a story: the origin of the problem we’re all trying to solve, born in fields of rusted satellites and fossilized code. I conjure images in mid-air with my words: floating cities made of wind, algorithms woven into dragonfly wings, power grids that hum lullabies to sleeping continents. Figures and facts swirl around my arms as living auroras, morphing at my command. Each time I reach for a statistic, the numbers bloom into breathing constellations, evolving transparently for all to inspect. Data comes alive, and the audience leans forward, drawn into the gravity of shared imagination.

Midway through, the chandeliers descend until they hover at shoulder height, transforming into crystalline memory orbs. One by one, they capture the story-scenes I paint, then drift off to land in attendees’ laps, gifting them their own glowing fragment of the vision. Anchored inside these opaline spheres, my improvised solution takes root, personalized for each listener—an investment banker sees projected yields, a climatologist sees carbon curves, a humanitarian sees villages lit for the first time.

I feel the original fear return—an undertow tugging at my ankles—whispering: All sleight of hand, all theatre. But then I notice something: the ripples beneath me have calmed into a perfect, placid sheet, reflecting stars that weren’t there moments ago. My voice no longer trembles. The tide inside my chest has receded, leaving behind a shore strewn with polished inspiration.

As I close, I hold up the gutted presentation binder. Pages dangle like wilted wings. I tear them free and fling them into the air. To gasps, they burst into white moths that flutter upward, vanishing among the chandeliers. Silence swells—infinite, luminous—before breaking into an ovation so thunderous the mirrored water fractals into prisms, spraying rainbows across every face.

When the applause finally fades, the lead decision-maker rises. His suit is stitched with constellations that realign as he moves. He bows slightly, then extends a contract sealed with a ribbon of pure sunlight. I take it, and the paper folds itself into a small, beating heart that nestles against my palm.

From the balcony, dawn’s first light floods the hall, dissolving ceiling and walls until we stand on a boundless horizon of morning clouds. The audience becomes a murmuring forest of silhouettes, then disperses into dusky swirls—ink returning to the inkwell of sleep.

I turn the heart-contract over in my hands. It melts into a golden key shaped exactly like possibility. I slot it into an unseen lock in the sky and—

I wake, tangled in bedsheets, heart pounding but light as helium. On my nightstand lies a single paper moth, wings etched with barely legible glyphs, as though it followed me out of the dream. When I touch it, the letters rearrange once more, coalescing into the words:

Trust the improvisation.
