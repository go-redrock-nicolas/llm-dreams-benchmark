I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself in a bustling city, the streets are filled with vibrant colors and life. I'm drawn towards a group of people walking together, their unity and purpose intriguing me. As I approach them, I feel a warm sense of belonging, as if being a part of this group was always my natural state.

With time, the group identity begins to seep into my consciousness. My personal decisions seem to become guided by the collective desires and expectations of the group. The subtle shift is both comforting and unsettling; the comfort of unity juxtaposes against the loss of individuality.

As I navigate through this dream, I experience a struggle between the pull of collective identity and the need for individual expression; the conflict highlights the delicate balance between belonging and autonomy, leaving me with a profound realization about the complexities of human connections.
