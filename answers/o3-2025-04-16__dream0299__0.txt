I am dreaming. …lift your gaze from the crystalline ground and find yourself standing on the edge of an impossible landscape: an ocean of molten starlight that rises and falls like the breathing of some cosmic leviathan. Every wave glints with constellations, and each crest whispers half-remembered lullabies from your childhood. The sky above is no sky at all but a great velvet vault of ink, streaked with auroras that move like brushstrokes in slow motion.

A figure approaches—neither man nor woman but a being woven entirely of fractured moonbeams. Their voice is music caught in a windchime:  

“Traveler of the liminal, take this chance: cross the Sea of Liquid Night to claim the Ember Seed. Plant it in the heart of any world, and that world will bloom with undying wonder. One seed, one wish. But know this—each step you take across these waters may rewrite your very story. Forget too much of who you are, and you may never wake.”

In their shimmering palm lies a small, pulsating ember, no larger than a tear but brighter than a supernova. Tiny images flicker inside it—snapshots of possibilities: your loved ones laughing beneath cities suspended by vines of gold; a desert blossoming with libraries carved into living cactus; a lonely planet transformed into a kaleidoscope of living color. Tremendous rewards, indeed.

Yet the risks coil around your thoughts like serpents:  
• The Sea of Liquid Night is alive with memories not your own. A single misstep could drown you in forgotten dreams.  
• Reach for the Ember Seed too greedily, and the weight of infinite possibility could crush your waking mind.  
• Worst of all, the being of moonbeams hints that time itself is a currency—years of your life may burn away for every heartbeat spent upon the waves.

You steady your breath, deciding to weigh your options as rationally as one can inside a dream.

First, you bend down and scoop up a handful of the crystalline sand at your feet—it melts into quicksilver, then reforms into faintly glowing origami cranes that flutter upward. An idea blooms: perhaps symbols, not steps, will carry you safely. You create a paper boat from the cranes, and the boat expands, unfurling sails made of shimmering lullaby fragments. The Sea of Liquid Night lets out a low, echoing purr, almost amused.

The figure of moonbeams bows. “You’ve learned the first secret: imagination here is as solid as stone. But each invention extracts a memory. Choose carefully what you’re willing to trade.”

You feel a tiny tug at the edge of your mind—your first pet’s name slips away like a feather in wind. In its place, the paper boat grows sturdier, reinforced by the sentimental energy.

“Risks are not merely danger,” you murmur to yourself. “They’re transactions.”

You step onto the boat. The moment your foot touches its deck, the vessel lifts from the shore, gliding across the luminous waves. Each swell reflects a possible version of you: a poet crowned in ivy, a scientist stitching auroras together, a wanderer made of ragged lightning. With every reflection, the water hums a question: “Who will you become?”

Halfway through, the sea around you erupts into obsidian spires—your doubts, manifest and towering. They whisper all the reasons you should turn back: fear of losing your memories, fear of failing the waking world, fear that this is nothing but ego clothed in starlight.

You answer by unfurling the mainsail of the boat, which you weave from your most resilient childhood dream: the one where you flew over rooftops chased by friendly dragons. It costs you the memory of your first heartbreak—an odd bargain, but it lightens your heart enough to catch a gust of twilight wind and slip between the obsidian spires unscathed.

At last, you reach a tranquil gyre in the center of the sea. The Ember Seed hovers here, throbbing like the core of a newborn galaxy. Up close, you see that it contains not only dazzling hopes but flickers of grief, rage, laughter—every emotion an entire civilization could produce. The weight of possibility presses on your chest; it feels like holding the blueprint for creation itself.

The figure of moonbeams reappears at your shoulder. “All you must do now is claim it,” they say, “but claiming is choosing. To take it means surrendering any certainty about the life you know.”

You close your eyes and let the dream swirl through you like oxygen. You picture your waking self, sitting by a window, yearning to mend a fractured world. You picture strangers you have never met, waiting for miracles. You feel the Sea of Liquid Night pulsing with memories you’ve shed—but you also feel lighter, larger, as though the space you cleared inside has made room for something luminous.

And you decide.

With hands made steady by wonder, you reach forward and gently cradle the Ember Seed. It warms to your touch, then dissolves into a spiral of glowing script that writes itself across your skin. Each letter sings a promise: “No reward without risk. No dawn without the dark.”

The Sea of Liquid Night shatters into a million moths of silver and ink, and they swarm around you, carrying you upward, upward, until the velvet vault cracks open into a blazing sunrise.

When you awaken in your own bed, heart hammering, you find a speck of glowing dust cupped in your palm—no bigger than a poppy seed, yet pulsing faintly. You sense that somewhere in the waking world, an impossible garden has already begun to sprout.

You smile, the taste of starlight still on your tongue, and whisper to the morning air: “Risk accepted. Reward unfolding.”
