I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the threshold of an ancient, sprawling estate hidden deep within a dense, emerald forest. The air hums with an otherworldly glow—fireflies pulse golden light in slow, hypnotic rhythms, and the scent of jasmine and something spicier, like cardamom or star anise, wraps around me. 

The house itself breathes. Its wooden beams, intricately carved with symbols that shift when I blink, seem to whisper in a language just beyond my understanding. Lanterns flicker with blue flames, casting elongated shadows that ripple like water. My partner—whose face is both familiar and strangely new—squeezes my hand. "Remember," they murmur, "here, names have weight. And silence sings."

Inside, the family gathers in a hall where the ceiling arches into darkness. Their eyes gleam like polished obsidian, unblinking. A grandmother draped in robes of midnight silk offers me a silver bowl filled with blackberries that bleed ink when touched. "Taste," she insists. The juice stains my fingers, but the flavor is electric—memories not my own flash behind my eyelids: a childhood in a village I've never seen, laughter in a tongue I suddenly comprehend. 

Then, the dancing begins. Not with feet, but with hands—fingers weaving intricate patterns that pull threads of light from the air, sculpting stories between palms. I’m pulled into the rhythm, my own hands clumsy but earnest. Laughter rings crystalline when I fumble, but it's kind, warm. Someone presses a chalice into my hands; the liquid inside mirrors the night sky, constellations drifting lazily. 

"You're one of us now," my partner whispers, and the walls sigh in agreement. The dream hums with belonging, strange yet achingly right.
