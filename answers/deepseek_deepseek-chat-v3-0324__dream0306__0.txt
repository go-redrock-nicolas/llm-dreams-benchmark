I am dreaming. * * *

The air smells of burnt sugar and melted wax as I find myself standing in a cathedral of clocks—each one ticking out of sync, their hands spinning wildly like distraught dancers. The floor beneath my feet is a mosaic of shattered mirrors, reflecting fractured versions of myself, each fragment whispering a different argument: *Be practical. Be brave. Bend. Break. Stand firm.*

Before me stretches a bridge woven from strands of golden thread, glowing faintly in the lavender gloom. It leads to a city floating in the sky, its towers made of silver promises and streets paved with easy victories. But the threads tremble as I step closer—with every movement, they fray, threatening to snap.

To my left, a door of black iron embedded with thorns creaks open, revealing a narrow path into shadow. No promises wait there—only a cold wind carrying the scent of wet earth and stubborn roots. The thorns whisper too: *This way will bleed you. This way is true.*

I hesitate, and the mirrors shriek. The clocks accelerate, their chimes colliding into a cacophony. My own reflections reach through the glass, gripping my arms—some pulling me toward the gilded bridge, others toward the thorned dark. 

Then, silence. A figure made of shifting smoke drifts forward, wearing a mask with two faces: one laughing, one weeping. It extends a scale in its hands. On one side, a melting crown of gold. On the other, a single unbroken arrow, feathered with the colors of dawn. 

*Choose,* the smoke murmurs, though its mouths do not move. *The crown will lighten, but the arrow will weigh heavy. The arrow will wound, but the crown will empty.*

I reach out—and the dream fractures into a shower of clock gears and black petals, scattering into the dark before I can decide... leaving only the echo of the pendulum's swing, and the certainty that I must wake to choose.
