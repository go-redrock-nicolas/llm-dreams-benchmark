I am dreaming. The walls around me are neither solid nor fixed—they shimmer like liquid oil on water, shifting colors as my thoughts twist and turn. Before me, three doors float, unmoored from gravity, each pulsing with its own aura.  

### **First Door: The Artist’s Labyrinth**  
I step through the first door, and suddenly my hands are stained with paints that don’t exist in the waking world—colors like *memory-blue* and *laughter-yellow*. A canvas stretches infinitely before me, a blank void demanding creation. My brush moves without hesitation, strokes flowing like liquid emotion. I paint a city made of musical notes, where the streets hum with melodies instead of traffic, and the sky is a throbbing, living tapestry of unspoken dreams. The air smells of wet clay and burning incense, intoxicating and dizzying.  

But before I can finish, a whisper tugs at me—**"Switch."**  

### **Second Door: The Logic Engine**  
The world snaps into sharp, crystalline angles. I’m now standing in a vast grid of interlocking gears, each turning with perfect, rhythmic precision. Numbers spiral like falling leaves from a fractal tree, and I catch them midair, arranging them into equations that unravel the secrets of the universe. I see the code of reality itself, binary flickers woven into the fabric of existence. A disembodied voice speaks in theorems, proposing a riddle: *If a thought becomes a thing, does it cease to be a thought?* My mind races, constructing proofs and counterproofs—until suddenly, cold tendrils of emotion creep in.  

**"Not yet,"** the dream hisses. **"One more."**  

### **Third Door: The Heart’s Observatory**  
Here, gravity is love. I float in a space where every breath is a story, every heartbeat an echo of lives I’ve never lived. Faces flicker in and out of existence—strangers, yet somehow known. Their joys press against my ribs like warm sunlight; their sorrows sting like winter rain. A woman with starlight in her hair weeps, and I feel the weight of her grief, a crushing serpent coiled around my throat. A child laughs, and my chest fills with golden helium.  

I reach out—but then—  

### **The Collapse of Realms**  
The doors merge. The paint on my hands turns into numbers, then dissolves into tears. The logic engine fractures, emotions surging through its wires. I’m pulled in all directions at once, fracturing and reforming, an endless metamorphosis of thought and feeling.  

And just as madness seems inevitable—  

I wake.  

But the dream lingers like a shadow, whispering:  
*"You are all three at once."*
