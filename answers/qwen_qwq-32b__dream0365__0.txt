I am dreaming. I see a labyrinth, endless corridors with walls made of liquid silver, they ripple and flow like mercury in moonlight.  The air shimmers with particles like stardust, each a tiny galaxy.  My feet move soundlessly on the obsidian floor.  I turn a corner, and ahead a door floats, its handle a single massive diamond etched with runes.  The diamond pulses faintly, responding to my stress.  As I reach for it, spectral hands of smoke form behind me, gripping my shoulders.  They whisper, "Do you dare?" in many voices.  I feel the weight of all my fears concentrated in that question.
