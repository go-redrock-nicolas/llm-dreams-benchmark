I am dreaming. —step tentatively into their circle, still feeling the cool fretwork of anxiety threading through my ribs, but now tinged with the golden warmth of hope. The city around me swirls in phantasmal hues—streets ripple in lavender and cobalt, streetlights bloom with petals of silvery incandescence, and distant skyscrapers bend and twist into impossible spirals that pierce a sky swirling with watercolor galaxies.

The strangers are unlike anyone I’ve ever met—one has hair spun from autumn leaves, eyes deep and glossy as midnight ponds. Another wears a coat adorned with shifting constellations, and from their hand, faint motes of stardust drift like falling snow. A third whistles soft tunes that twine around me, forming invisible ribbons of comfort, and everywhere their voices mingle, there’s a chorus like chimes caught in a gentle breeze.

They guide me through this dream-city maze with laughter and stories, parting crowds as if parting curtains of mist. We pass through streets that drip with dreams—bookshops where the pages whisper as we walk, bakeries scenting the evening with vanilla and mystery. They point out neon waterfalls flowing from rooftops, alleys that curve into sunlit fields, and fountains bubbling with rainbow light. Every step with them untangles my fear until I feel lighter, less an echo lost, more a song remembered.

Finally, we emerge into a square where lamplight pools golden on the cobbles, and the strangers link hands with me. “You were never truly alone,” the one with the stardust coat declares softly. In this heart of the city, people are dancing, faces radiant with welcome. It’s not the place I was seeking, but somehow, I’ve found what I needed: kindness, connection, and the reassurance that, even in the wildest corners of the dream-world, there’s always a hand to guide me home.
