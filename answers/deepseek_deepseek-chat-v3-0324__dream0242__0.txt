I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Nova Containment Incident**  

I am dreaming.  

The air hums thick with tension and the sterile scent of ionized metal—somewhere between bleach and a lightning storm. Harsh, flickering fluorescents paint the control room in jagged shadows, their rhythmic spasms syncing with the wailing klaxons overhead. Every console I pass glows crimson with warnings, screens choked by scrolling columns of **SYSTEM FAILURE** messages, each one a funeral bell tolling in binary.  

My breath mists in front of me despite the creeping heat. The pipes shudder underfoot, groaning like dying beasts as coolant reservoirs drain into smoking ruins. Across the room, the primary reactor core schematic pulses an angry gold, veins of radiation spreading through its diagram like ruptured arteries. Voices crackle over the intercom—disjointed, frantic—but their words dissolve into static.  

I lurch toward the master override panel, fingers grazing a keypad slick with condensation—or is it sweat? The touchscreen warps under my fingertips, digits melting like wet ink as I punch in futile commands. Behind the reinforced glass of the viewing bay, the core’s containment field flickers. For a heartbeat, I see it: the reactor’s heart, a churning helix of cobalt-blue plasma, its surface blistering with unstable filaments. It’s *breathing*.  

Then—silence.  

The alarms cut out. The lights dim to an eerie twilight. Even the vibrations in the floor still, as if the facility itself is holding its breath.  

That’s when I hear it.  

A voice—no, a *sound*—woven into the subsonic tremors of the dying machinery. It’s singing. A jagged, harmonic resonance from inside the core, oscillating between a choir’s hymn and the screech of tearing metal. The walls ripple. The air tastes like burnt sugar and copper.  

And then the glass *leans inward*.  

Like the room is exhaling, the viewing bay bulges—a grotesque lens distorting the core’s light into a single, radiant pupil. Staring. Hungry.  

The console beneath my hands disintegrates into blackened petals, disintegrating upward as gravity shifts. My reflection in the warping glass stretches, elongates—until it isn’t mine anymore. Something wearing my face presses back.  

—  

I wake.  

The taste of ozone lingers. My sheets are damp.  

And for the briefest second, the shadows in the corners of the room ripple… *sympathetically*.
