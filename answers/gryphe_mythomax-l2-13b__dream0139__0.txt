I am dreaming. I find myself in a society where conventional logic is considered madness and irrational thinking is the norm. To function in this backward world, I have to suspend my beliefs and embrace irrationality. Everyone around me seems to be bat-shit crazy, but they are content with their lives. I feel like an outsider, as if I'm floating in this bizarre universe.

The streets are filled with peculiar creatures who roam freely without any regard for societal norms. They dress in eccentric clothing, speak in nonsensical languages and engage in activities that would be deemed illegal or immoral in our world. In this place, they are free to express themselves without fear of judgment or consequence.

As I continue to observe this strange society, I notice a group of individuals gathering on the outskirts of town. They are all wearing blue robes with hoods covering their heads. They move in sync with each other, almost like a dance. I am drawn to them, fascinated by their ritualistic behavior.

As I approach, the group parts to reveal a glowing object in the center. It pulsates with an eerie light, casting shadows on the surrounding area. I can't quite make out its form, but it's clear that it holds some sort of power over the members of this group. They bow their heads in reverence, chanting words I don't understand.

Suddenly, one of the group members removes their hood, revealing a scarred face still stuck to a skull. Their eyes are empty sockets, but they seem to be filled with an unearthly wisdom. Without warning, the glowing object in the center begins to glow brighter, enveloping the entire group in a blinding light.

When the light fades, I find myself standing alone in a barren wasteland. The dream ends as I wake up, disoriented and confused. But as I lay in bed, trying to make sense of what I just experienced, a part of me wonders if there was some truth behind that dream.
