I am dreaming. …lift your eyelids to find yourself not in a bedroom, but adrift upon a vast, midnight-blue lake whose surface is so perfectly still that the stars overhead appear to hover both above and below you, an infinite double-sky. For an instant you’re weightless—no boat, no shore, just the hush of cosmic water cradling you like a cradle made of liquid dusk.  

A breeze you cannot feel nonetheless ripples the mirrored firmament, and each ripple transforms into a line of glowing script, as though the wind were writing secret equations across the universe’s reflection. The letters shimmer, rearrange, and resolve into the first question you ever asked as a child: “Why is the dark dark?” The lake answers with silence, but the silence is so resonant it feels like a symphony of velvet.

You laugh—really laugh—because suddenly every unanswered question you’ve shelved for years is drifting toward you on origami paper boats. You reach out and pluck one: “How does a forgotten smell return to memory?” The paper dissolves into silver motes that fly into your fingertips, and you remember, with impossible clarity, the scent of rain on chalk from your first day of school. The memory is so crisp it blooms like a flower behind your eyes, and for the first time in ages you’re astonished that your own mind can harbor such time-capsule fragrances.

The lake begins to rotate, as though the whole body of water is turning like a galaxy. With each slow spin, you rise upward, standing now on an invisible platform. Below, the lake spirals into a whirlpool that doesn’t sink downward but instead funnels upward into the sky, becoming a helix of water and starlight. You step into it, weightless, and the water is warm as sunlight, sliding past you without wetting your clothes.

As you ascend through the helix, scenes unfurl on its watery walls:

• A living city made of glass keys, chiming with every footstep.  
• A desert where grains of sand hold micro-universes, and you see civilizations waving back at you from inside single granules.  
• A forest whose leaves are thin slices of time, fluttering with yesterday’s breeze and tomorrow’s storm.  

You realize nothing here obeys the physics you thought were etched in stone; reality has traded brittleness for playdough, inviting you to press your fingerprints into its surface.

At the helix’s summit you emerge onto an island drifting in the night sky—a floating garden shaped like a Möbius strip. Flowers bloom on both sides of the single continuous path, their petals bearing fractal patterns that spiral inward forever. You bend close to one blossom and hear music: your grandmother humming in the kitchen, the clink of dishes, your own nine-year-old laughter. Each flower sings a personal lullaby of forgotten moments, and you realize existence itself has been recording every heartbeat, every breath, every stray marvel you once ignored.

A figure approaches along the Möbius path—transparent at first, then sharpening into your younger self, perhaps seven years old, wearing shoes two sizes too big and pockets full of acorns. The child regards you with unfiltered awe.

“Do you still believe anything can happen?” they ask.

You open your mouth to reply, but language suddenly feels too narrow. Instead you take the child’s hand. At the touch, memories ignite: sneaking out at dawn to watch dew forming on spiderwebs; the first realization that clouds cast shadows; the thrill of discovering that whispering into a conch shell seems to echo from another world. Wonder rushes back like oxygen after a deep dive.

Hand in hand, you step off the garden’s edge. Gravity doesn’t punish you; instead, staircases of luminous air coalesce beneath your feet, assembling themselves just in time with each stride. You climb higher, and each step rings like a bell tuned to a forgotten key of joy.

Above, the moon opens like an enormous eye—iris the color of quasar fire, pupil a tunnel of swirling nebulae. Without fear you enter, passing through a veil of cool mist that smells like library dust and wintergreen. Inside is not lunar rock but an immeasurable library, shelves built from braided beams of moonlight. Books hum like bees, eager for fingertips.

You pull a tome titled “All the Mornings You Have Yet to Wake To.” When you open it, pages flutter out, each turning into a translucent window. Through them you glimpse futures still coiled in possibility: conversations that will reshape you, ordinary mornings suffused with quiet miracles, strangers you’ll love fiercely for an hour or a lifetime. A gentle tremor of gratitude rises in your chest, painful and exquisite, and you’re stunned that you were ever capable of boredom.

The child-self leans against your side, pointing to a final window. It shows you, old and silver-haired, planting apple trees in soil made richer by decades of fallen leaves—leaves you haven’t yet allowed to fall. In the dream’s radiant logic you understand: every ordinary act will glow if you look closely enough; wonder is not scarce but self-renewing, provided you remember to ask and to notice.

The library lights dim, firefly-soft. The child hugs you and dissolves into a cluster of sparks that swirl upward, spelling “Stay curious” before dispersing like fireworks.

A distant chime sounds—alarm clock or cosmic bell, you can’t tell. The shelves, the moonscape, the staircase of air all fade, but the feeling remains, stitched into the lining of your consciousness like a secret pocket.

In the instant before you wake, you whisper a vow to the dream, to the child, to yourself: I will tread the waking world as though the miraculous is draped over every surface—because, at last, I remember that it is.
