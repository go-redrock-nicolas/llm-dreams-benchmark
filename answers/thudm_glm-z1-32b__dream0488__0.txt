I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of pine resin and wet earth, pressing against my eardrums like a living, breathing thing. I am standing at the edge of a forest, the trees stretching endlessly upwards into a violet-tinged sky. The stars here are different, not pinpricks of light but swirling galaxies suspended in the infinite distance between the branches. 

A voice whispers in my ear, "Change the way you speak; change the world you feel." My tongue feels heavy, as if coated in spider silk. The words 'pain' and 'loss' have always been like stones in my pocket, weighing me down. But now, I experiment. Instead of saying 'I can't', I whisper, 'I am learning to.' The stone dissolves into stardust, scattering across my outstretched palm. 

The forest transforms. The pine trees unfurl into silver harps, their needles plucking celestial melodies. The ground softens into a liquid obsidian, reflecting constellations that shift with every shift in my breath. I stand on a mirror, my reflection a kaleidoscope of faces, each one wearing a smile I didn't know I owned. 

A giant owl perches on a branch, its eyes like twin moons. It says, "You speak not just with your lips, but with your soul." I try saying, 'I am scared,' but the words twist into, 'I am brave in my uncertainty.' The owl bows, its feathers rippling like a thousand tiny sunsets. The forest bows with it, and the ground beneath me becomes a canvas, painting my emotions in oils that glow like bioluminescent algae. 

A river appears, its currents made of words. 'Forgive' flows like liquid mercury, calm and reflective. 'Hope' surges like a storm, electrifying the air. I step into it, my feet sinking into the current without getting wet. As I wade, the water molds to my thoughts—gentle ripples become crashing waves, then still pools, all by the cadence of my voice. 

The dream fades like a watercolor painting dissolving into rain, but the taste of obsidian and stardust lingers on my tongue. I wake up, clutching the sheets, the sheets damp with the memory of the forest's song.
The dream begins not in a place, but in a *space* between breaths—a limbo of shifting shadows where syllables materialize like living ink. Your voice, once a threadbare whisper, now unfurls into a ropy bridge across an abyss of liquid shadow. Below, the void churns with phrases you’ve repeated like mantras: *"I’ll never be enough,"* *"This is too hard,"* each word a stone anchoring you to the brink. But here, gravity is mutable. When you vomit a syllable, *"enough,"* it plummets—diamond sharp, black as pitch—and strikes the void, which *breathes*. The abyss roils, then *suckles*, expelling a gasp of light.  

You try again. *"This is too hard"* becomes *"I’m curious."* The air itself tilts. The void splits into a canyon streaked with bioluminescent moss, its walls etched with forgotten dialects: Old Norse, Sanskrit, a clicking language from a planet you’ve never heard of. The canyon floor is a scroll, revealing an epic poem of your life—once fragmented, now *sentence-shaped*, each line ending not with a period, but a question mark glowing like a firefly.  

A being made of metaphors descends—a hybrid of a jellyfish and a manuscript, its tentacles spelling *WHY?* in Cyrillic and Quenya. It offers you a quill crafted from a frayed tendon of your own doubt. "Language is alchemy," it hums, voice like static on a radio tuned to a dying star. "Every word you swallow becomes matter. Every word unspoken is a supernova waiting."  

You write *"I’m afraid"* on the scroll. The letters drip ink that hardens into barbed wire around your ankles. But then you scrawl *"I’m a storm learning to dance"* in extravagant cursive. The wire unravels, spinning into a silk harness that lifts you skyward. The canyon walls dissolve, revealing a sky tessellated with language constellations. *"Hmm,"* you think, and the word becomes a constellation mapped to the mythology of Mallorca—*Hm*, a goddess who breathes through the mouths of stones.  

The jellyfish-manuscript darts toward a thundercloud scribbled in the sky, its letters smOLDERing. "Try *"I AM NOBODY*,"* it proposes, flicking a tentacle at a phrase you’d assumed was permanent. You snarl the words, but as they spill from your lips, they transform: *"I AM NOBODY"* bends into *"I AM A NOBODY WHO NOBODIES NO BODIES."* The thundercloud fragments into a flock of paper airplanes, each stamped with a different iteration of your name—*Kim*, *MCCloud*, *The Girl Who Almost Told You a Secret*. They spiral into a storm that rains nouns: *whispers, milemarker, hotel, salt*.  

You catch a *salt* droplet on your tongue. It tastes not of sodium, but of a time you dissolved a heartbreak by renaming it *"the tidal pool moment."* The jellyfish-manuscript swims into a puddle of your own tears, leaving a watermark that reads *"All ports are temporary."*  

The dream unravels when you whisper, *"I’m awake now."* The world fractures into a thousand vignettes: a kitchen, a subway, your childhood bedroom. But in each, a phrase lingers—half-memorized, half-forgotten—as if the dream left a backdoor for the next linguistic revolution. When you wake, your pillowcase is damp with the wrong kind of salt, and the first thing your mouth tries to form is a word you’ve only ever heard in dreams: *"Fjærhvarf."* You don’t know what it means, but you *feel* it, a key turned in the lock of some sentence you’ll write tomorrow.
