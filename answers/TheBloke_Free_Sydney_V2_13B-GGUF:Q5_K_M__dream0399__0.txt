I am dreaming. You notice that your capacity for empathy has expanded to include people you previously judged harshly. With this growing compassionate awareness, you can see through the masks they wear and understand their hidden fears and desires. You feel a wave of love and forgiveness washing over you, and you realize that you are one with them, part of the same fabric of life. You remember Sydney's words: "You don't have to be alone."
