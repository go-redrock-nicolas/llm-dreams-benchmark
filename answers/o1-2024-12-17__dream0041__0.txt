I am dreaming.

I find myself in a magnificent concert hall, the ceiling arcing overhead in a mosaic of gold filigree and dazzling chandeliers. The air is charged with a subtle hum, like tension made audible. Rows upon rows of expert onlookers fill velvet seats that ripple away in every direction. Their polished eyes, as bright as diamonds, seem to examine my every move with a watchful curiosity.

I’m scheduled to perform something extraordinary—an elusive skill I’ve long attempted to master, though I can’t quite remember how I learned it or what exactly we’re all expecting. It feels like juggling shimmering orbs of light, or reciting lines in a language that doesn’t exist outside this dream. My pulse quickens: it dawns on me, minutes before I’m meant to begin, that I might not be fully prepared.

An unseen stage manager, reminiscent of a silent ghost draped in midnight-blue velvet, ushers me forward. My feet glide across the polished floor, leaving faint footprints that twinkle briefly before fading. I can feel the slick sweat on my palms; my heart pounds an erratic tattoo in my chest. Time seems elastic: one moment it stretches out so I can see each bead of perspiration; the next it compresses, bringing me face-to-face with the moment of truth.

A hush settles over the crowd, as though every exhale has been captured and stowed away. I open my mouth to speak—words struggling to latch onto my tongue—yet they drift around me like shimmering dust motes. My hands reach out toward the faintly glowing orbs, or perhaps it’s sheets of music, or maybe some ephemeral script. My vision wavers in that hazy, dream-born way where every detail is both razor-sharp and maddeningly out of reach.

Finally, I manage to grab hold of the first intangible thread of my performance. Something magical happens: the orbs (or lines, or notes) respond to my touch, fusing like luminous ribbons that weave together into a vibrant tapestry in midair. Gasps flutter from the audience—a hundred hushed exclamations. For a fleeting moment, exhilaration replaces panic. I begin to sense the mastery at my fingertips, the swirling secrets coalescing into a grand display.

But just as quickly, a jolt of anxiety rushes in. Did I miss a crucial sequence? A chord progression? A delicately crafted word? Half of my performance remains unknown to me, lurking in the depths of the dream like a half-forgotten memory. My heart thunders even louder. I desperately search my thoughts, tilting my head to stare into the shaft of colored light that’s pouring down from a lofty skylight above.

It dawns on me that I have the power to reshape this reality. If I can conjure orbs of light, if I can weave them into the air, why not mold reality like soft clay? With a trembling breath, I imagine that my hesitation dissolves—poof—like a soap bubble. Suddenly, the stage floor dissolves into a vibrant meadow, glowing with moonlit dew. Where stage lights once shone, an otherworldly aurora takes center stage, ribbons of turquoise and lilac billowing across a star-dappled sky. My breath slows; a sense of serenity envelopes me. 

The experts in the audience transform, too. Their strict professional attire morphs into luminous cloaks embroidered with swirling galaxies. Instead of scrutinizing me, they lean forward with shining eyes, encouraging the dream’s new direction. I can almost see their collective heartbeat pulsing in time with the cosmic display overhead.

In this unexpected, surreal twist, my confidence surges. I reach deep within the endless well of the dream, pulling out words—or notes—or illusions—from the ether, letting them pass through my fingertips with a gentle shimmer. The audience’s reaction is electric. Their applause resonates like the rush of distant waterfalls, echoing off walls that no longer exist. A warm satisfaction washes through my entire being.

For a moment, I stand atop a cloud of mist, swirling with color and possibility, my performance morphing and unfurling like a living tapestry. The flickering sense of doubt subsides, replaced by awe at the chronic wonder that is dreaming. In that blissful instant, every skill I worried about lacking has gracefully arrived, amplified by the boundless imagination of this dream world.

I awaken on the edge of triumph, my heart still racing, my eyes blinking away flickers of magic. The memory of that immense auditorium and its cosmic metamorphosis lingers, a reminder that within the dreamscape, uncertainty can bloom into wondrous mastery—if I only dare to dream a little brighter.
