I am dreaming. As the dream begins to take shape in my imagination, I find myself standing in a serene landscape - soft, green grass beneath my feet stretches out as far as the eye can see, interrupted only by small clusters of wildflowers in a variety of colors.

Some people pass me by and as they brush past, I feel a noticeable drained sensation in my body. Their colors aren't quite right - faded, darkened versions of the people I'm used to seeing, and I realize their auras are putting strain on my inner reserves, like they have emotional needs that are unimaginably large.

On the other hand, there are others who emit a magnetic kind of glimmer, a radiant light that seems to emanate warmth from their core. The closer they are, the more my own energy is restored and enhanced. Their colors reflect more vibrant hues compared to the rest, and I start to make out the sound of gentle, soothing melodies radiating from them that keep me calm deep inside, addressing my thoughts and desires in an enchanting voice.

These are two sides to every relationship, my subconscious mulls, pondering the delicate balance we must maintain. It seems we can feel the effects within our very core, a reflection of the bigger universal principles at play.
