I am dreaming. nd I find myself standing in a vast, open field of golden wheat that stretches as far as the eye can see under a deep blue sky. The warm sun beats down on my skin as the soft breeze carries the gentle whispers of my loved one, though they're nowhere to be seen. But then, a figure slowly materializes in the distance, their face twisted in anguish and pain.

As they draw closer, recognition dawns on me. It's the person I inadvertently hurt, their eyes filled with sorrow and betrayal. I desperately want to rush to their side and apologize, to wipe away their tears and soothe their aching heart. But my feet feel rooted to the spot, unable to move or speak as the weight of my regret threatens to crush me.
