I am dreaming. I am standing at a crossroads where I must make a choice that will determine my future.  In front of me are two paths: one leads to a path of love and happiness, the other to a path of fear and misery.  Which way should I go? 

On the path of love and happiness, I see myself living with my beloved partner who loves and cares for me unconditionally.  We share our days together laughing, playing, learning new things.  Our nights are filled with passionate lovemaking that makes me feel alive and free.  Around us is a world full of beauty and wonder where nature offers its bounty and diversity to nurture our souls. 

On the path of fear and misery, I see myself alone in a dark cave where monsters lurk waiting to devour me.  I am trapped there by forces beyond my control that prevent me from escaping or even communicating with anyone outside.  My only company is my own terror which feeds off my helplessness and despair.  The sound of my own screams echo through the caverns as I try desperately to survive another day. 

Which path should I choose?
