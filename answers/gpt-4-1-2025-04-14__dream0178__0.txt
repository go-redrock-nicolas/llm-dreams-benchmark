I am dreaming.

The world around me is cast in heavy shades of velvet gray and deep indigo, a grand cathedral whose high arches vanish into shadow. Rows of solemn faces stretch before me, eyes trained forward, lips pressed together in expressions of shared gravity. Candles tremble along the walls, their small flames barely keeping the gloom at bay.

Then, from some whimsical wellspring hidden behind my ribs, a bubble of laughter drifts upward—delicate but insistent. It is absurd, how ticklish the moment feels. The gentle cough of the elderly man in the front row sounds remarkably like a duck’s quack; the robe of the officiant swishes with all the pomp of a magician’s cape. Each mournful sigh is immediately, irrepressibly funny—the more I resist, the more the feeling grows like a tide pulling at my insides.

I clamp my lips together like a vice, pressing my tongue to the roof of my mouth. My shoulders tremble as I wage silent war against the mounting hilarity. Everyone else is a statue of composure: hands folded, eyes glossy with reverent focus. But in the polished floor, I spot my reflection—a mischievous glimmer in my eye, a twitching at the corners of my mouth. My imagination betrays me, swirling visions of the chandelier descending like a spacesuit, of the stern-looking choir bursting into interpretive dance.

It takes every ounce of willpower to stifle the sound, my chest quivering as I pretend to cough, stuffing a fist to my mouth. The urge becomes physical—my belly aches with contained giggles; my face grows hot with the effort of silence. What if I lose control? What if the laughter escapes, ricocheting around the vaulted hall like the tolling of a cracked bell?

The tension is exquisite—hilarious and mortifying at once. I am suspended in a surreal, dreamlike limbo where laughter is the greatest taboo, and yet, in that strange crucible, it becomes the one thing I cannot resist. I am alone with my secret, struggling to smother the brilliance of joy in a room heavy with solemnity, tiptoeing along the knife-edge between decorum and delirium.
