I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**  

I am standing in a twilight garden where the air hums with the scent of crushed roses and old parchment—sweet yet faintly bitter. The sky is a bruised violet, streaked with gold, as if caught between sunset and storm. Before me, a figure I’ve loved for years—their face shifting like sand through an hourglass, now familiar, now a stranger. Their voice, usually warm as a hearthfire, drops to a whisper, and the words land like stones:  

*"I chose you because you were easy to trust. Because you weave dreams into reality, and I needed that magic."*  

A mirror shatters at our feet, but the shards don’t reflect *us*—they show countless moments replayed: their eyes darting away when I laughed too loudly, their hands always steering me toward choices that bent my spine into shapes *they* found useful. The realization should split me in two. But then—  

The garden exhales. The roses twist into vines, wrapping around my wrists like bracelets of thorns and velvet. *They* flinch back, but I don’t pull away. Instead, I press a palm to the nearest mirror fragment and watch the scene inside ripple. Now it’s *me* they’re mirroring—my unguarded grin, the way I etch constellations onto mundane moments. Their pupils dilate with something like hunger. *My* magic, *my* alchemy, has always been the real weapon here.  

I smile, slow as a blade being drawn. *"Funny,"* I say, *"how kindness can be a trap for the hunter too."* The vines bloom black dahlias, poison-sweet. Their breath hitches. I lean in, close enough to share a pulse, and whisper, *"Thank you for the lesson. Now watch what I build from it."*  

The dream fractures—not into darkness, but into a thunderclap of wings as a thousand crows take flight from my shadow. And I?  
I wake up laughing.  

** What happens next in the dream—do the crows carve a new path, or does the garden swallow the past whole?**
