I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, dusky forest. The canopy overhead is dense, casting the ground below in shadows. For a moment, I stand still, breathing in the earthy scent of leaves and decomposing wood. All of a sudden, the trees around me begin to shimmer and shift, almost as if they're alive.

As I watch, fascinated and terrified, one of the trees steps forward, its branches spreading out like a tentacle. It begins to move towards me, leaving a trail of broken twigs in its wake. I try to back away, but my feet are rooted to the spot. Panic wells up within me as the tree, which seems to be becoming more and more humanoid, reaches out towards me.

Then, just as it's about to touch me, the tree pauses. A low, throaty growl echoes through the forest, and I realize that I'm not alone. Slowly, a figure emerges from the darkness, walking towards the tree on two legs. It's a woman, her long hair tangled and mossy, her skin pale and glowing in the faint light.

The woman steps between the tree and me, and for a moment, they lock eyes. She speaks in a language I don't understand, but I feel the weight of her words nonetheless. The tree seems to relax under her gaze, its branches retracting back into its trunk.

Without a word, she turns and begins to walk deeper into the forest. I follow her, my heart beating fast in my chest. As we walk, the trees around us begin to shift and move, as if they're part of some living, breathing entity. I realize with a shudder that they are.

We come to a clearing, and there, in the center, is a glowing pool of liquid, pulsating with an eerie, hypnotic rhythm. The woman gestures for me to approach, and I do, hesitantly. As I reach the edge of the pool, I feel myself being pulled in, as if by some unseen force.

I wake up, gasping for breath, my heart racing. It was just a dream, I tell myself, trying to calm down. But the memory of it lingers, haunting me in the back of my mind.
