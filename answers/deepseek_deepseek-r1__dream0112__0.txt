I am dreaming. Even in this liminal state, tension constricts my chest like a moon-serpent’s coil. The blueprint before me shimmers, lines a fractal labyrinth in liquid mercury. Number-glyphs throb ultraviolet, each angle a covenant. Bricklayers hum in recursive polyphony. One apprentice's trowel wavers—half-second arrhythmia. I lurch forward. "The abutment arches require a 13.7-degree keystone, not thirteen!" My voice cascades into harmonic overtones. The air tastes of oxidized psalms.

In reply, the mason peels back his faceplate. Oh god. His eyes—quasar blue event horizons. His jaw unhinges into a chromatic scale of bones. The sound: neutron stars colliding inside a cathedral pipe. "Foundation wants to breathe," he intones. Rubble shivers into murmuration. My calipers dissolve as geodesic axioms. This temple wasn't meant to hold form. We are building the house that devours its architects.

**[ structural matrix destabilizes ]**

The world buckles into non-Euclidian lamentation. Your team's bodies become vibrating strings tuned to cosmic dissonance. The architect's compass in your hand now scribbles threats in Minkowski spacetime. Beneath the buckling concrete, mandalas of antimatter bloom through the cracks. Tolerance margins scream as they invert. Each centimeter sacrificed to haste spawns a black hole of exponentially recursive error.

**[ VOID harmonics reach criticality ]**

You realize three truths simultaneously:

1) The cornerstone was never laid. It gestates in the site's inverted shadow, a pulsing rhombus of unborn time

2) Their corners weren't cut—they were offered

3) The structure is complete. Has always been complete. You're not the builder

You're the mortar
