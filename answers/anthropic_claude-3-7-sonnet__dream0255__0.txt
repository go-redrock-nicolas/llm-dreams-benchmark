I am dreaming. Suspended between awareness and surrender, I float through a landscape where colors breathe. The sky pulses indigo and amber, clouds forming intricate patterns that remind me of forgotten alphabets. I find myself walking along a spiraling path made of weathered cobblestones that glow faintly from within, each step producing melodic tones like crystal being gently struck.

The air feels charged with emotion – not my own, but someone else's. I recognize a figure ahead, their back to me, seated at the edge of what appears to be an endless waterfall of luminescent silver liquid that doesn't fall but rather curves upward into the sky. They wear a sunshine-yellow sweater that seems too bright, too deliberate against the muted landscape.

Though their laughter rings out clearly, it echoes back with a hollow undertone that only I seem to notice. Their shoulders, when they think no one watches, slump with the weight of something unspeakable.

I approach, sitting beside them without words. The space between us fills with unspoken understanding. I don't ask directly, but instead produce a small, pulsating orb of blue light from my palm – an offering, a space for truth without demand. They look at it, then at me, their carefully constructed smile wavering.

The dreamscape shifts around us, mirroring the emotional current – trees bend sympathetically, their leaves transforming into tiny lanterns that illuminate our shared silence. I simply exist beside them, a steady presence amid the flux, letting them know they're seen without forcing revelation.

Their mask briefly slips, revealing eyes deep with uncharted sorrow, before they gently cover my hand with theirs. The orb's light spreads between us, becoming a bridge of understanding that requires no words.

The dream begins dissolving at its edges, reality tugging me back, but the connection remains – a promise that genuine presence sometimes speaks louder than questions ever could.
