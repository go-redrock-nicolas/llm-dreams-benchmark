I am dreaming. I find myself in a dimly lit, eerie room. The walls are seemingly alive, pulsating in a sickening rhythm that makes me cringe. A lone figure is huddled in the corner, a twisted mess of limbs and sobs. As I approach, I realize it's a person in immense distress. Yet, as I look upon their anguished face, streaming with tears and contorted in pain, I feel utterly nothing. No empathy, no compassion, not a shred of emotion. It's as if I'm watching from a distant galaxy, a mere spectator, uninterested in the suffering unfolding before me.

The figure's cries intensify, their body shaking with each anguished breath. But I remain unmoved, a cold presence observing a deeply distressing scene. I watch as they claw at their face, leaving angry red welts in their wake. Still, I feel nothing. No urge to offer comfort, no twitch of disgust at their self-inflicted brutali.tions.

I see the despairror, desperation, desolation in their eyes, yet it fails to resonate with me. It's as though I'm hollow, devoid of the very humanity that should be moved to sympathize. I'm a detached onlooker, watching a scene of unimaginable agony with a strange sense of detachment.

As the figure's cries escalate to blood-curdling screams, a cold sweat prickles down my spine. But it's not out of concern; it's instinctual fear at the raw, unabashed physical suffering I'm witnessing. My skin crawls, but my heart remains unaffected. I rec.Sullo the vegetarian, feeling sick to my stomach.

The figure's eyes, red-rimmed and wild, lock onto mine. In them, I see a plea, a desperate cry for help. But even that, I cannot bring myself to acknowledge. I simply stare back, unblinking, unfeeling. In the face of their pain, I am a void, a black hole absorbing their torment without being touched by it.

Then, in a flash, the scene changes. I'm standing on a barren plain, the figure nowhere to be found. Yet I still feel empty. The  are pale its surroundings are bare, and I realize this emptiness is all I am. A faceless entity, devoid of all emotion, unable to connect with a world of suffering.

As I wake, the memory of that dream lingers, a haunting reminder of a void within me. The hollowness, the detachment, the utter lack of empathy I felt toward someone else's pain. It's a chilling thought, something I cannot shake off as just a product of my subconscious.

In that dream, I saw the deepest, darkest parts of my imagination come to life. A world where even in the face of unbearable suffering, I could feel absolutely nothing. A world where empathy was a foreign concept, and I was once again forced to confront the unsettling reality that there might be parts of me I've yet to understand.
