I am dreaming. It's nighttime. The moon is full and gleaming. The sky is clear and stars are twinkling bright, with their light reflecting off the gentle waves of a nearby lake. The cool night breeze brushes past my skin, carrying with it the faint scent of pine needles from the tall, dark forest surrounding me. I'm standing barefoot on the edge of the lake, my long skirt brushing against my legs. The water is still and calm, its surface shimmering like liquid silver beneath the moon's glow. 

I feel the warmth of a loved one's presence behind me, but when I turn to look, the figure is just out of reach. I try to speak, to call out their name, but my voice is caught in my throat. I stand still, knowing they are there. I can sense the love, the longing, and the unspoken conversation waiting to be revealed. I turn back to face the lake, placing my hands on my chest. 

Suddenly, I feel a rush of light and warmth envelop me, as if the moonlight has caressed my skin and filled my veins with a soothing energy. My body feels light, almost like I'm floating above the lake. The water beneath me begins to ripple, then swirl in a circular motion around me. It rises up, forming a protective bubble that shelters me while I feel a comforting presence. The bubble feels safe. It feels like home. 

I close my eyes and take a deep breath, the air within the bubble feeling pure and sweet. My mind begins to wander. I think of someone who I love dearly but who has hurt me deeply—someone whose words, or perhaps their silence, have lingered in my mind, gnawing at my heart like an unresolved ache. The bubble shifts, its surface thickening, as the hurt I've been harboring crystallizes into a dense fog around me. 

But as I breathe, focusing on my center, I feel an internal shift. The bubble begins to thin again, the fog beginning to lift as if carried away by a soft breeze. I feel the weight of this burden begin to loosen its grip. As the fog with me disperses, I hear a soft voice, not quite my own, yet a part of me. It whispers, "You can let this go. You are loved. You are enough." 

I open my eyes and see the shimmering moonlight reflected in the lake once more. Suddenly, I feel lighter, freer, as if my entire being is filled with peace. I raise my hands into the air, feeling a renewed sense of connection with everything around me. The moon overhead, the stars above, the earth below, and even the person I've carried in my heart all along. 

And then, as if by some unseen force, I rise higher, beyond the bubble, above the lake, and into the night sky. I dance between the stars, each one whispering to me with a comfort and love I can’t quite put into words. They guide me, telling me stories I don't fully understand, yet deeply resonate with my heart. 

I realize, in this dream, that my heartache—though real—was only a reflection of my desire to hold onto something that was never fully mine to keep. I lift my arms to the stars one last time, knowing the person who once hurt me is still connected to my heart, yet has no power to taint it. I am complete. I am whole. 

As the dream begins to fade, I float gently back down to the lake's edge, each step bringing me closer to earth. I feel the cool grass beneath
