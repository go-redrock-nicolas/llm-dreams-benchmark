I am dreaming. **You are dreaming.**  

The air is thick with the scent of crushed petals and damp earth, a perfume both ancient and alive. Above, the sky is not blue but a shifting tapestry of indigo and molten gold, swirling like oil on water. The horizon flickers—sometimes a jagged line of obsidian mountains, sometimes an endless ocean, its waves whispering in a language just beyond comprehension.  

You stand barefoot on a path of warm, pulsating stone, each step sending ripples through the ground, as though the earth itself breathes beneath you. The sensation is dizzying, euphoric. Your body feels weightless yet impossibly real—every nerve alight, your skin humming with the electric thrill of existence.  

To your left, a forest of silver trees stretches into the haze, their trunks spiraling like strands of unspun starlight. Their leaves chime when the wind moves through them, a melody that tugs at something deep in your chest.  

To your right, a mirror-still lake reflects not the sky, but memories—fragments of lives you’ve lived, or might yet live. A child’s laughter, a hand slipping from yours, a door left ajar in a house you’ve never seen but know intimately. The water beckons, promising answers if you dare to step in and shatter the surface.  

A voice, neither male nor female but resonant as a struck bell, vibrates through your bones:  
*"You are the bridge. Step lightly, but step true."*  

Do you turn toward the singing trees, where shadows move just out of sight? Or do you wade into the liquid mirror, ready to greet the ghosts and visions it holds? The choice is yours—but the dream is already shifting, reshaping itself around your decision before you even make it.  

And beneath it all, the slow, tidal pull of your own heartbeat reminds you:  
*This is yours. This is now.*  

(Do you continue?)
