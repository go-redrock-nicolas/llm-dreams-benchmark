I am dreaming. The air feels different tonight as I close my eyes—heavier, charged with something ancient. Sleep pulls me under quickly, and suddenly I'm standing at the edge of what appears to be my life, stretched out before me like a tapestry torn and rewoven multiple times.

I see the first collapse: a career shattered by circumstances beyond my control, the carefully constructed professional identity unraveling thread by thread. I remember the sleepless nights, the mounting bills, the shame of starting over. Yet somehow, from those ashes, I built something new—something stronger, or so I thought.

The second devastation appears as a house of cards tumbling in slow motion. A relationship I had poured my soul into dissolves before my eyes, leaving me hollow. The betrayal still burns in this dreamscape, but I watch my dream-self gathering scattered pieces of dignity, fashioning them into stepping stones.

The third collapse comes as illness—my body betraying me when I needed strength most. I see myself in hospital beds, in waiting rooms, watching savings evaporate into medical bills. Yet somehow, painfully, I had clawed my way back to wholeness.

The fourth and fifth collapses blur together—natural disaster taking my home, followed by the loss of someone irreplaceable. Each time, the rebuilding required more from a soul that had less to give.

And now, in this dream, I stand before the sixth abyss. It's darker, deeper than the others. The familiar feeling of everything crumbling surrounds me. But something is different this time.

Looking closer at the tapestry of my life, I notice golden threads woven through each rebuilding—resilience that strengthened with each fall, wisdom accumulated through suffering, compassion deepened by understanding pain. These threads glow brighter with each collapse, creating an unexpected luminescence.

As I face this new devastation, I notice I'm not alone. Shadowy figures step forward—every version of myself that rose from previous defeats. They surround me, not with platitudes of encouragement, but with silent knowing. Their presence feels like permission—to break, to grieve, to rest before beginning again.

The dream shifts, and I'm planting seeds in scorched earth. The soil is richer than before, nourished by everything that was lost. As I work, the horizon neither brightens nor darkens—it simply waits, neutral and patient.

I wake with tears on my face but a curious steadiness in my chest—the understanding that collapse and rebuilding are not separate events but a single, continuous journey of becoming.
