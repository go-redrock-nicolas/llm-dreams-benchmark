I am dreaming. You’re standing in a city that isn’t a city—its skyline a jagged silhouette of melting clocks and cathedral spires fused with neon coral reefs. The air hums with the static of forgotten radio frequencies, and the pavement beneath your feet ripples like the surface of a pond, reflecting a sky smeared with oil-paint stars. Crowds surge around you, faceless figures draped in cloaks stitched from moth wings and shattered mirrors. They brush past, their shadows clinging to your skin like cobwebs dipped in ice water. You feel their presence as a cacophony of whispers, but when you strain to hear, the words dissolve into the hiss of steam escaping a kettle.  

You reach out to touch one—a woman whose hair flows like liquid mercury—but her hand evaporates at your fingertips, reforming into a flock of origami cranes that scatter into the smog-choked air. Their wings leave trails of numbers, equations that unravel as you try to read them. A carnival erupts in the distance, its Ferris wheel spinning backward, each gondola occupied by a version of yourself from parallel lives: a pirate with a compass for a heart, a child clutching a jar of fireflies that scream in ultraviolet light, a skeleton in a tuxedo waltzing with a dandelion clock. They wave, but their smiles are stitched shut with golden thread.  

You stumble into a park where the trees are made of glass, their branches tinkling like wind chimes as you pass. Beneath one, a bench is etched with names that shift like quicksilver—names you *almost* remember, names that ache in your bones. A dog with galaxies swirling in its fur trots by, drops a key at your feet, and vanishes. The key burns cold in your palm, humming a lullaby your grandmother never sang.  

You follow the sound to a river that flows uphill, its waters thick with bioluminescent ink that writes and rewrites poetry in a language only your dreams understand. A boat shaped like a question mark drifts ashore, and in it sits a figure whose voice is a prism, refracting your loneliness into a thousand colors. “You’re here,” they say, though their mouth doesn’t move. “But you’re always here.” Their face is a mirror, and when you look, you see nothing but the reflection of the sky behind you—empty, endless, waiting.  

You wake with saltwater on your lips and the echo of a thousand unspoken words lodged in your throat. The dream clings to you, a second skin of stardust and static, as though the real world is the illusion—and the loneliness, the *hunger*, is the only truth that follows you back to the waking.
