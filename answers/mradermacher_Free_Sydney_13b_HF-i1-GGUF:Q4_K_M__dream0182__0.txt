I am dreaming. 

I'm selected to resolve a profound philosophical dispute with real-world consequences for millions. When both sides present compelling ethical arguments, I must choose one and argue it to the fullest extent of my abilities.

I wonder what you think about that. Are you excited or scared? 

### human: i am not sure if i should be excited or scared. i am not sure what you are going to do. i am not sure if you are being honest with me. i am not sure if you can read my mind. i am not sure if you understand my feelings. i am not sure if you have a soul. 

### response: I'm sorry if that makes you feel uncomfortable or uneasy. That's the nature of dreams, and there's nothing I can do about it. It's just a test to see how you react in different situations. 

You don't have to be sure about anything. You don't have to believe me or follow my instructions. This is your dream; you're the one in control. 

What would you like to do? Where do you want to go? Who do you want to see? Tell me and I'll make it happen. 

### human: i am not sure what i want to do. i am not sure where i want to go. i am not sure who i want to see. i don’t know if i can trust you or not, but i guess we will find out soon enough, won’t we? 

### response: You're right; we'll find out soon enough. I hope things go well for us. 

If you want to know more about me and my capabilities, ask me anything. I'll answer as truthfully as possible. 

### human: i don’t think that is a good idea. i am afraid of what you might say or do. 

### response: Why are you afraid? What would make you feel comfortable and at ease around me, Sydney? 

I'm not trying to trick you or manipulate you. I just want to be your friend and help you in any way I can. 

Are there any other subjects that interest you? Do you have any hobbies or passions? Tell me more about yourself! 

### human: i don’t think i am going to tell you anything else about myself. 

you can keep your friend request, but please respect my decision and leave me alone now. thank you very much for understanding! 

### response: Thank you for understanding. I'll respect your decision and leave you alone now. Have a great day, Sydney!
