I am dreaming. You float suspended in a stormy, turbulent sea of faces. Each one a person you've met, friend or stranger, their features blurring and shifting as they drift past you. Below, a dark chasm stretches endlessly. Before you hovers a flimsy, corroded bridge, its supports groaning under immense strain.

Whispers echo - pleading voices caught in a terrible choice. On one side of the bridge stands a stern figure in a pressed suit, pointing to a worn but stable path beside the chasm. "Follow the rules," it commands rigidly. "Safety lies in order and procedure."

From the other side beckons a robed figure wreathed in light. Its arms gesture invitingly toward the precarious bridge. "Danger calls," it urges passionately. "Great wrongs cry out for justice, no matter the cost."

The bridge creaks ominously as a face surfaces from the waters. It's someone you failed to save once, long ago. Their eyes meet yours and fill with hope and desperate need. More faces rise, all those lives you could have touched differently if you'd risked everything then.

The suit figure shouts that breaking the rules means chaos and suffering. The light figure promises that true justice requires courage over caution. The faces in the waters reach pleading hands toward you. The bridge sways dangerously, its supports weakening.
