I am dreaming.

An inexplicable hush falls across the marble-floored atrium as an ornate scroll, bound in sapphire ribbon, lands in my trembling hands. I have been named Chancellor of the Celestine Academy—a luminous, centuries-old institution perched atop a mist-shrouded mountain, its spires lost among drifting clouds and sunbeams. Hallways echo with the footsteps of scholars revered across civilizations, their portraits flickering in the candlelight, their eyes brimming with chilly judgment.  

My heart hammers with dread and awe, my name still alien upon the grand doors embroidered in gold filigree. I am acutely aware of the whispers threading through the air: “She’s an outsider, a novice… What could she possibly know?” Each glance in my direction is a silver needle, sharp and cold, pricking at my deepest insecurities.

But the corridors wear secrets like invisible cloaks, and as I wander the labyrinthine library—shelves curling toward the domed ceiling in impossible spirals—something ancient stirs inside me. I lay my hand on a dusty tome; its cover thrums, warm beneath my touch. Suddenly, my mind is emblazoned with unknown histories, esoteric equations, symphonies of color and light. 

Night after night, I grapple with doubt, haunted by the vivid presences of past masters who seem to glide through the halls, their knowledge tidal, overwhelming. Yet, through the frosted windows, the moon casts a silvery path onto my desk—a wordless invitation to claim what’s been offered. I gather the scholars, skeptics all, into the cathedral-like amphitheater, its high windows awash in dawn’s blush. My voice trembles, then steadies as I speak of wonder, of curiosity greater than fear. I share visions conjured from my midnight revelations—visions belonging to no curriculum, yet brimming with possibility.

Skepticism begins to flicker and soften into sparks of interest, then gratitude. The order of things is overturned, not with force, but by the breathless urgency of a dream—a dream where those without the “right” past can ignite a luminous future. As the sun rises and the ancient bells resound, I realize that perhaps it is not lineage or title that brings me here, but the courage to welcome the unknown, and the willingness to kindle a fire in the deepest dark.

In the dream, I am more than I dared imagine. And because I believed, so do they.
