I am dreaming. You’re standing on a glass bridge suspended over a sea of phosphorescent lilies, their petals pulsing with pale blue light. Across from you, two colleagues hover like twin comets locked in orbit—one’s aura crackling scarlet with indignation, the other’s are of emerald frustration. Their words collide in the ether, shards of argument scattering like stardust. The project they champion—a grand cathedral of ideas built from fragile hope—wavers on the brink of collapse.  
  
They turn toward you in unison, eyes burning with expectation. “Who’s right?” they demand, voices echoing off invisible walls. In that instant, the lilies below shimmer brighter, as if awaiting your decree. Your heart pulses in rhythm with their tension, and the dreamscape bends to your choice.  
  
You inhale the cool, sweet scent of possibility, and instead of choosing sides, you speak with a calm resonance that ripples through the air: “Imagine your ideas as two wings of the same bird. Alone, neither can carry you far—together, they soar.” At your words, the scarlet and emerald auras entwine, weaving into a brilliant gold light that bathes the bridge. The lilies respond by releasing a gentle chorus of hums, and the colleagues’ eyes soften.  
  
With the tension dissolved, the shattered fragments of argument reassemble into a mosaic of fresh perspectives. You guide them to merge the fiercest passion of one with the steady insight of the other. As they lay down arms of accusation, picking up tools of collaboration instead, the glass bridge extends forward, leading toward the cathedral of ideas. Together, you step across the dawn-lit horizon, ears still ringing with hopeful possibility—and you awake from the dream, heart thudding with inspired clarity.
