I am dreaming. You find yourself in a vast, inverted forest where the trees grow downward from a violet sky, their roots clawing at a glassy, black ocean below. The air hums with the whispers of unseen creatures, and your footsteps leave glowing ripples on the mirrored surface beneath you. A figure emerges—a child with eyes like shattered opals, trembling as they clutch a key made of frozen smoke. They beg you to help them unlock a door that floats in the void, its surface etched with the faces of forgotten gods. You smile, not with kindness, but with the hunger of a spider sensing a fly’s struggle. You take the key, feel its cold weight, and promise to help. But instead, you slip the key into your pocket, savoring the child’s widening despair like a vintage wine. Their tears crystallize into diamonds, which you pocket as well.  

The world shifts. Now you stand in a cathedral built from teeth, its vaulted ceilings humming with the echoes of a thousand confessions. A priestess with a serpent’s tail coils around a pillar, pleading for your aid to heal her dying cult. You agree, not to save them, but to drink their faith like nectar—to let their devotion warp into obsession, feeding your own shadow until it towers over the horizon. You become a god here, bloated and radiant, your veins glowing with stolen prayers. But as the cult’s chants crescendo, you feel your ribs crack, your heart hardening into a black stone. The more they worship, the less human you become, until you’re a hollow idol, screaming silently as your own soul dissolves into the hymns.  

The dream fractures. You wake in a garden of thorns, your hands bleeding, the child’s key burning in your pocket. The ocean below the inverted trees now churns with faces—those you’ve used, their mouths open in silent screams. The priestess’s voice hisses from the thorns: *“To feed is to be fed upon.”* You realize, too late, that every advantage taken has bound your fate to theirs. The dream ends not with triumph, but with the slow, suffocating understanding that exploitation is a mirror—and in gazing too long into its depths, you’ve become the reflection.
