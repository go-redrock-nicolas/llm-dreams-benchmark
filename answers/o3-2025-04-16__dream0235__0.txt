I am dreaming. …step from a hush-white fog onto a terrace of living quartz. Moonlight, too silver to be earthly, runs like water beneath your bare feet. A semicircle of figures awaits you—tall, cloaked in gauze that never settles, faces hidden behind masks carved from pearl. Silence is total, yet the air thrums with possibility, as though every stone remembers music.

You recall that in this place language has no consonants, no vowels—only motion. Every tilt of a wrist, every breath-quick tremor of a shoulder, every ripple in the drifting cloth around them is a phrase, a paragraph, an autobiography. Words would clang like iron here; gestures are the only medium fine enough to carry feeling without bruising it.

A slim figure—her mask lacquered with opal dust—steps forward. She does not greet you; instead, she lifts her left hand and traces a downward spiral beside her heart, the spiral widening with a slow exhale. You sense it means Welcome, but not simply welcome: it enfolds the ideas of shelter, curiosity, and the mild shock of meeting one’s own reflection in a stranger. 

To answer, you must invent motion you do not yet know. Instinct suggests mirroring, so you try: right hand, not left, drawing a tentative spiral outward. At once you feel it is wrong—the shape, the pace, the side. The air around the semicircle shivers with polite melancholy, like a sigh muffled behind curtains. You have said, clumsily, I am afraid your kindness might break me. 

A second figure intervenes with mercy. He fans both palms outward, fingers fluttering like moth wings, then lets them glide down along invisible seams by his ribs. In a flash of comprehension you understand: Here is patience, a gesture saying We will teach you if you wish to stay.

So the initiation begins.

They lead you through halls sculpted from translucent amethyst that traps dawn inside its walls. Every corridor opens to an atrium where floating ribbons of bioluminescence map the grammar of this motion-tongue. Dotted lights leap from ribbon to ribbon—conjugations, tenses, flavors of mood sliding into place. You learn by imitation as fluid as dreaming allows: 

• Gratitude is a gentle arc traced from navel to sky, wrist loosening at apex as though letting birds escape.  
• Remorse is two pulses at the sternum followed by an outward uncurling of fingers—an apology freed from the cage of the ribs.  
• Wonder requires full-bodied spiraling: one foot planted, the other orbiting, arms describing slow galaxies around your spine.  

When you falter, the ribbons dim only slightly, urging correction without rebuke. When you succeed, they flare aurora-bright, washing your skin in shifting turquoise and rose.

Night—if night truly exists here—returns you to the terrace for the final rite. Attendants extinguish gravity itself; you and the community lift from the floor like dandelion seeds. In weightlessness, choreography becomes conversation. You ask Where do I belong? with a supple figure-eight traced by your knees. Dozens answer by forming a moving lattice around you—each person crossing, weaving, pausing, until you occupy the glowing center of their constellation. Their collective motion replies Everywhere that our orbit touches yours.

Then the opal-masked woman drifts close. She performs that same welcoming spiral, but shrinks it, tucks it gently into the hollow of your palm, and closes your fingers upon it. This, you understand, is a gift to carry into waking: a seed of gesture that will sprout whenever your heartbeat longs to speak without speaking.

A low chime hums against the curvature of the dream. The terrace dissolves into quicksilver ripples, the community disperses into streaks of comet-light, and the seed in your hand warms, becoming a pulse aligned with your own.

You wake—still, perhaps, feeling the ghost of a spiral expanding softly behind your ribs, an unspoken promise that every language can be danced before it is ever uttered.
