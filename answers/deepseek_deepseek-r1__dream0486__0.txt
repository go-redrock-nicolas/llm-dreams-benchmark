I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a luminous, trembling forest, where trees are not trees but towering sentinels of living light. Their bark pulses like veins of sapphire and emerald, each groove humming with the resonance of forgotten languages. My breath becomes the wind—moist, fragrant with the sweetness of decaying blossoms and fertile soil—and as I exhale, the leaves ripple into kaleidoscopic moths, swarming skyward to form constellations that bloom like phosphorescent flowers. 

Beneath my feet, roots rise and coil like serpents, not to bind me but to draw my soles into the earth. I feel the slow, primal heartbeat of the planet—not a sound but a warmth that spreads through my bones, ancient and nurturing. Mushrooms glow like scattered coins, their gills whispering secrets in ultraviolet; every spore carries a memory—a flash of dinosaurs wading through mist, ice ages fracturing continents, civilizations dissolving into moss. 

A stag approaches, antlers woven from starlight and spider silk. Its eyes are twin supernovae, collapsing and rekindling as they meet mine. With a nod, it leads me to a lake where the water is liquid obsidian, reflecting not my face but a thousand overlapping epochs: coral reefs thriving where cities once stood, wolves howling in symphonies that rewrite DNA. I step in. The cold is euphoric, purifying. 

Bioluminescent fish swim through my chest, stitching my ribs with threads of living kelp. I am no longer flesh but an echo of the ecosystem—photosynthesizing, decomposing, birthing wildfires and monsoons. Time unravels. The moon dips its cratered face to drink from the lake, and I dissolve into the hum of a million vibrating roots, into the chlorophyll singing in my veins. When I wake, my skin still hums with the memory of glaciers.
