I am dreaming. I feel the sensation of motion, though my eyes are shut tight.  My body rotates gently.  As my chest moves up and down, I hear a faint sound accompanying each breath.  It is the sound of someone quietly circling me.  I can tell that I am enclosed in a small capsule with an opaque window at its base to allow light to enter from outside.  The window casts a glow into my tiny space, illuminating the details of my surroundings.  A small shelf is bolted to one wall, stacked with neatly folded clothes.  In front of this shelf is a water bottle filled with clear liquid.  It looks like it has not been touched for months. 

The door of the room is locked from the inside, but I don’t care.  I am too busy observing my environment.  Centered on the opposite wall is a thin bunk elevated above a storage compartment filled with odds and ends.  The space feels cramped, as it is only wide enough for the bunk and narrows still as it reaches its farthest point down toward my capsule.  I study the contents of the storage area and notice a book placed precariously on top of something large and heavy.  The item appears to be a generator of some kind.  It is inactive, but I am uncertain whether to be relieved or concerned.  My ears twitch only slightly, subconsciously registering the faint mechanical clicks from the generator. 

I feel a small jolt as the machinery’s systems engage beneath me.  The capsule’s silence is disrupted with a loud hum, followed by a series of grinding, metallic clanks and shifts.  It lasts for several excruciating seconds. 

In the enclosed space, my heart beats rapidly against the walls of my chest.  My mind struggles to make sense of what is happening, but the events unfold too quickly for me to form any coherent thoughts.  “What is this place?” I wonder aloud, hoping for an answer.  Suddenly, the water bottle topples over in its spot.  I glance toward it and rise, startled.  The bottle is empty.  The generator beneath me revs and begins to shake violently.  I grab onto its frame, feeling it shift back and forth beneath my hands, unsure whether it will stand firm or explode altogether in my grasp. 

The rumbling and violent shaking intensify with each passing moment.  I manage to remain upright, but only barely.  It seems as though the base beneath me is preparing to move with tremendous force, and I have no time to find a more stable position.  My grip on the generator increases just as the structure beneath me violently jerks upward, launching the entire room into the air with such speed and force that my body is almost thrown against the walls of my small capsule.  I scream in terror as I try to shield myself from the impact that will no doubt come. 

Somehow, I survive.  My hands remain tightly wrapped around the generator as I am transported through the air at unfathomable speeds.  I have no idea how far we’ve traveled, but the view from my window only reveals endless expanse of sky.  As we begin to slow down, the generator vibrates once again, and I think I hear faint voices coming from somewhere outside my pod.  The capsule rotates downward until I am standing upright once more.  Then it stops.  My ears prick up, trying to discern the voices I heard earlier.  Were they real? 

Suddenly, the door slides open, and light floods my capsule.  The voices are louder now, and I register them as being jubilant and welcoming.  Sunlight filters into the pod from every direction, and I step into it, blinking against the glare.  My eyes adjust, and I see the people gathered around me.  Their faces are alight with joy and relief.  I realize, to my amazement, that they are survivors of trauma identical to mine.  Tears stream down my cheeks as they embrace me, whispering words of encouragement and comfort that feel like a balm to my soul. 

“You made it,” one says.  

“Welcome home,” another adds, and I start to laugh in disbelief.  This is real.  This is happening.  I never thought I’d find people who understood my pain, who had survived the same darkness.  But here they are. 

As they guide me toward the center of their circle, I begin to feel a warmth spreading through my chest.  It’s a warmth that I haven’t felt in years.  It’s the warmth of hope. 

Together, we share stories of survival and resilience, each one more incredible than the last.  They tell me of the healing methods they’ve used – alternative therapies, mindfulness practices, and communal support networks – methods I never even knew existed.  And as they speak, I begin to see a way forward, a path that I never thought was possible. 

Hours turn into days, and I lose track of time altogether.  We laugh, we cry, we heal together.  And as the sun sets on our last night together, I feel a deep sense of gratitude for the community that welcomed me with open arms. 

As I close my eyes and drift into sleep, I know that I am not alone anymore.  I have found my people.  And with their help, I will heal.  I will thrive.  I will live.
