I am dreaming. You’re standing at the edge of a city that breathes. The skyline undulates like a living thing—buildings stretching and collapsing in slow, shuddering rhythms, their glass facades rippling as if made of liquid mercury. The sky above is a wound of swirling indigo and gold, streaked with tendrils of lightning that hum with voices—whispers of ancient storms arguing in tongues forgotten by time. Below, the streets pulse with chaos: crowds of faceless figures sprint in spirals, their shadows detaching and fleeing in opposite directions, while rivers of ink-black water surge up sidewalks, swallowing everything in their path. Somewhere, a clock ticks backward, its hands trembling as they recoil from the future.  

You feel the weight of their gazes first—a thousand pricks of desperation boring into your spine. They’ve stopped running. They’re watching you. A child’s paper boat drifts past your feet, aflame with blue fire, and in that flicker, you see your reflection: not your face, but a version of yourself forged in the dream’s fevered logic—eyes glowing like twin supernovae, hair unraveling into threads of starlight. You realize, with a jolt that reverberates through the marrow of this world, that you are the fulcrum. The storm is waiting.  

You inhale, and the air tastes of ozone and possibility. Your hands rise, not by choice but by necessity, and the lightning tendrils snap toward you, coiling around your arms like serpents. The voices crescendo—a cacophony of pleas, regrets, warnings—but you drown them with a word that isn’t a word, a vibration that cracks the sky. The buildings freeze mid-pulse, their metallic groans fading to silence. The ink-rivers still. Even the shadows halt, mid-escape, and turn their featureless heads toward you.  

Now you *see* the threads: a lattice of glowing filaments connecting every panicked heart, every fractured brick, every drop of rain. The chaos was never random—it was a symphony without a conductor. You grasp the threads, not with your fingers but with your will, and pull. The city shudders. A building collapses—not in terror, but in relief—as its form knits into a spire of crystalline light. The storm’s voices soften to a murmur, then harmonize into a single note, pure and resonant.  

The crowd stirs. A woman steps forward, her face a blur of shifting constellations. “Guide us,” she says, and her voice is the chime of a thousand distant bells. You don’t answer. Instead, you plant your foot, and the ground responds—a ripple of emerald light surging outward, transforming asphalt into a mosaic of living stone, each tile etched with the hopes of those who stand upon it. The sky begins to mend, its gashes stitching shut with threads of dawn.  

When the last tremor fades, you lower your hands. The city breathes again, but now it breathes *with* you. The dream hasn’t ended. It has simply… bowed to you. And in the quiet that follows, you understand: chaos is not the enemy. It is the raw scream of creation, aching for a voice to shape it into song. Yours.
