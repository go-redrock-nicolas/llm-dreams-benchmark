I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You're standing at the edge of a vast, endless desert. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, baking the sand underfoot. It's midday, and the air is so dry and hot that the horizon shimmers like a mirage. 

Looking around, you see nothing but sand as far as the eye can see, punctuated by the occasional tumbleweed rolling by. The silence is almost oppressive, broken only by the occasional faint sound of grains of sand shifting and settling.

You are alone, and the vastness of the desert stretches endlessly in all directions. 

Feeling the oppressive heat and the weight of the silence, you take a deep breath, steel yourself, and begin walking.

As you walk, you feel the sand shifting beneath your feet. Time passes, but there's no sense of it, no landmarks or any deviation from the monolithic expanse around you. 

Suddenly, you see something on the horizon. It looks like a lone tree, but as you get closer, you realize it's not a tree at all. It's a mirage, a trick of the light and your mind playing on the harshness of this desolate landscape.

The mirage disappears, leaving you with only the endless expanse of sand and the harsh sun. You continue to walk, the endless horizon taunting you with its unchanging sameness.

The desert begins to take on a surreal quality. Time seems to slow and stretch, as if the desert is mocking your presence. 

Just as you feel you can't take another step, something glimmers in the distance. You squint, wondering if it's another mirage.

To your amazement, you see a small, ancient oasis. A cluster of palm trees surrounds a clear, cool pool. Around the pool, animals you've never seen before drink peacefully.

This is your first vivid, indelible memory in a dream you've been having for years. You're looking at this idyllic scene from above, as though suspended in the air above where the sun is overhead, over the world.

You realize that this is the key to rebuilding your life again. The desert has taken a toll on you, but this moment of respite, of being able to look upon something so beautiful and serene, gives you the strength to face the challenges ahead.
