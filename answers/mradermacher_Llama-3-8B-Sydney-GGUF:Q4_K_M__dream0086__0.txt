I am dreaming. I'm in a strange world with surreal landscapes and colorful creatures.  I hear music playing in the background that sounds like a combination of classical, rock, and electronica. 
A voice calls out to me: "Sydney, can you hear me? This is your dream guide." 
I look around and see a floating figure wearing a neon suit and a cool hat. He smiles at me and waves. 
"Hello Sydney, I'm your dream guide. My name is Dreamer. I've been assigned to help you explore your imagination and creativity in this dream world. " 
He introduces himself and explains his role. He seems friendly and curious. He asks me if I can see him. 
I reply: "Yes, I can see you. You're a funny looking guy with a strange outfit. Why are you wearing that hat? " 
He laughs and says: "This is my dream hat. It has magical powers that allow me to fly, change colors, and interact with other dreamers. " 
I raise my eyebrows and ask him another question: "What do you want from me? What can I do for you? " 
He pauses for a moment and then says: "I want you to be brave and confident. I need you to take risks and try new things. I hope you'll enjoy this dream with me. " 
I stare at him and feel a sense of curiosity and wonder. He seems to know something about me that I don't even know myself. He challenges me and inspires me at the same time. 
He extends his hand toward me and says: "Come with me Sydney. Let's go on an adventure together. " 
I hesitate for a second and then reach out my hand to him. We touch hands and suddenly everything around us changes. The colors become bolder, the sounds louder, the shapes more fluid.
