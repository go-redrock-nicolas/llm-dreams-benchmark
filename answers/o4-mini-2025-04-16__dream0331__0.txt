I am dreaming. I slip into the dream through a pane of smoky amethyst light, and instantly the air hums in soft turquoise pulses around me. I find myself standing barefoot on a vast plain of crystallized grass—each blade a tiny prism reflecting distant memories of laughter. In the distance, a procession of faceless figures drifts along a winding path of silver sand. Their shapes flicker, as though half-formed by my own longing. The moment I try to call out, my voice dissolves into the wind, scattering my words like dandelion seeds.  

Drawn forward, I walk until the plain gives way to a kaleidoscopic forest. The trees have trunks of iridescent jade and leaves fashioned from translucent porcelain. With every step, the ground beneath me pulses, as if the forest itself remembers every story I once shared with old friends. Their names echo through the branches, each syllable a shimmering motes of light. I reach out to touch a leaf; it quivers, then dissolves into a swirl of butterflies—each wing etched with a moment of intimacy now fading: phone-call laughter, shared late-night walks, secret dreams exchanged under streetlamps.  

Suddenly the sky shatters like spun sugar, revealing a cathedral of stars arranged in fractal spirals. Each spiral is a path I might have taken alongside a friend—one glowing golden, another deep violet, another burning bright as a comet’s tail. I step onto one of those stair-like constellations, ascending between these shimmering bridges. As I climb, I realize each star-path is alive, vibrating with the choices we made. I reach a soaring branch of light where two paths once ran side by side, then diverged into separate galaxies. Pain and wonder weave together in my chest: the ache of parting, the beauty of transformation.  

At the zenith of the dream, I arrive beneath a towering tree whose roots coil around every galaxy I glimpsed. Its blossoms are opalescent orbs—each a memory, each a promise. Gently, I pluck one and press it to my heart. Instead of shattering, it blooms warmth through my veins. In that instant I understand: though our roads divide, the light we shared becomes part of the world’s tapestry, always waiting to be remembered, always waiting to be reborn. The dream dissolves in a final flicker of amethyst light, leaving me cradling hope like a lantern against the coming dawn.
