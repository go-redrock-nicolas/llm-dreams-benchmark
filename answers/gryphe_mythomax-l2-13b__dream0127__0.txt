I am dreaming. I am standing at the edge of a vast, glimmering lake under a starry sky. The gentle lapping of the water against the shore creates a soothing rhythm. The cool breeze rustles through the leaves of towering trees, carrying with it the sweet fragrance of wildflowers in bloom. A glowing moon hangs low in the sky, casting its soft light upon the calm water.

Right in the middle of the lake, there is an enchanted island. It appears out of nowhere, sparkling with iridescent colors. As I look closer, I see that it's made up of thousands of tiny, twinkling stars that seem to dance and shimmer in harmony with each other. The music of the universe surrounds me, a melody that resonates deep within my soul.

Abruptly, I feel my body begin to sink into the soft sand beneath my feet, as if being pulled by an invisible force. The last thing I see before I wake up is the magical island disappearing back into the depths of the lake, leaving only a trail of stardust behind.
