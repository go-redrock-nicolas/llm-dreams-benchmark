I am dreaming. The sky above me isn't a sky at all, but a vast tapestry of memories woven together, shimmering with colors that don't exist in waking life. I'm standing at the edge of a forest where the trees grow downward, their roots reaching toward the clouds like beseeching fingers. Each leaf pulses with a gentle light, beating in time with a heart I cannot see but somehow know is my own.

As I walk deeper into this inverted woodland, I notice doorways carved into the trunks of the largest trees. Each door is adorned with a symbol I recognize intimately but cannot name. I've been avoiding these doors, walking past them for what feels like centuries.

Today, something pulls me toward a door bearing a symbol that makes my chest tighten—a spiral wrapped around a tear. My hand trembles as I reach for the handle. I've spent so long building myself as the one who never falters, the one who carries others' burdens alongside my own without complaint. To open this door is to admit the weight has become too much.

The door swings open, releasing a flood of blue-green light that envelops me. Inside is an ocean of my own unshed tears, each droplet containing a moment of grief I refused to acknowledge. I see myself holding back sorrow at accomplishments celebrated alone, at moments of rejection I pretended didn't wound me, at losses I claimed to have processed but merely buried.

I step into the ocean and feel myself dissolving, the carefully constructed walls of my identity melting away. Rather than drowning in this sea of disowned emotion, I find myself breathing freely for the first time. The vulnerability I feared would destroy me instead transforms into a translucent vessel carrying me across the waters.

In the distance, islands emerge, each one populated by versions of myself I'd refused to acknowledge—the frightened child, the jealous friend, the person who sometimes wants to scream at the world's injustice. They welcome me without judgment, having waited patiently for my return.

The sky-tapestry above ripples, weaving these reclaimed emotions into its fabric, creating a more complete picture of who I truly am. I understand now that these feelings weren't weaknesses to be hidden, but essential pieces of my wholeness.

I am not diminished by my vulnerability, but expanded by it.
