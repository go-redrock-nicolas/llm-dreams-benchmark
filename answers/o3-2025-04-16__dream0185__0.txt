I am dreaming. You are asleep, but the instant your mind slips into the dream you feel more awake than you ever do in daylight.  

A hush blankets the world as you step onto a circular platform the size of a coliseum’s arena. It hovers a breath above a black-glass lake that mirrors a night sky churning with emerald auroras and slow, molten comets. High overhead, tiers of seats spiral upward like an infinite nautilus, packed with figures from every nation—scientists in lab coats the color of bone, athletes with platinum musculature that ripples like liquid metal, grandmasters whose eyes glint like twin eclipses. They have resources, sponsors, teams, AI strategists, and you… you have a single, thundering heartbeat, a ragged notebook of half-erased plans, and a thread of belief so thin it’s almost imaginary.

A gong that sounds like a distant heartbeat reverberates. Lightning forks up from the lake and solidifies into translucent screens that float before each competitor. The final challenge blooms across yours in calligraphy made of neon starlight:

“Forge the Impossible. Time: one dreaming hour.”

Nobody knows what “Impossible” is supposed to be—everything is permissible, nothing is defined. Around you, opponents erupt into motion: a Japanese prodigy opens a briefcase that unfolds into a nanoforge, instantly knitting quantum circuitry in mid-air; a Kenyan savant whistles to an entourage of intelligent drones; an Icelandic engineer sketches runes, coaxing frost to weave self-assembling ice crystals into cathedral spires of logic gates.

Your palms sweat. Your notebook feels like a joke, its pages frayed by rain and coffee rings. Again that inner whisper: Against overwhelming odds, you—

But a second voice slices through panic: You are dreaming. The word resonates. Dreaming means the physics here are yours to negotiate. You close your eyes and dive inward the way a pearl diver crashes through sunsilver water.

First you summon a memory—your grandmother humming while repairing an old transistor radio with little more than stubborn patience and a crooked smile. She had no resources except time, curiosity, and love, yet the static burst into song. You inhale that memory until it’s incandescent, then fling it outward. It takes shape: a faint copper spiral twisting above your palm.

Next, you recall every failure you’ve endured—late-night solder burns, scholarship rejections, a thousand No’s. Each hurt crystallizes into dark glass marbles. You pour them into the copper spiral; they rattle, hiss, melt, fuse. Pain is fuel here.

Your opponents glance over, puzzled. You have no tools, only closed eyes and trembling fingers shaping invisible clay. But beneath the platform the lake begins to shimmer. Ripples radiate from your shadow, pulsing in sync with your heartbeat, and within each ripple floats a fragment of human dreaming: a child’s cardboard spaceship, a poet’s half-finished line, a gardener’s seed catalog filled with doodled constellations.

You draw those fragments up like a constellation fisher casting a net of will. They swirl around you—bits of daydream, ambition, grief, and lullaby—whirling faster, hotter, brighter until they fuse into a single, humming sphere the color of dawn before any sun exists.

At the thirty-minute mark a horn blasts. Judges—towering figures woven from algorithms and ancient myth—descend on runes of fire to inspect progress. Rivals unveil marvels: self-healing biocircuitry, a battery made of captured moonlight, a violin that plays equations. Applause blooms like fireworks.

Your turn. You raise the sphere. Externally it looks like nothing: a ball barely larger than a grapefruit, its glow gentle, almost shy. Doubt flickers in the judges’ eyes.

“What does it do?” one asks, their voice layered like a choir.

“It remembers,” you answer.

You close both hands around it and whisper the simplest of commands: “Show them.”

Instantly the sphere blossoms like a living nebula. Threads of light lance out and weave through the crowd. Wherever a filament touches someone, an intimate, buried dream unfurls above their head in luminous glyphs. 

A stoic engineer sees the woodshop her father promised to build but never had time for; tears streak her cheeks. A ruthless venture capitalist beholds a childhood promise to protect street cats. A cynical broadcaster glimpses himself at eight, believing in alien pen pals. The stadium gasps. Rivals drop tools, captivated by private, sovereign dreams made visible. The auroras dip closer, tasting the wonder.

The sphere maps the entire amphitheater until it hums with a chorus of personal impossibilities suddenly rendered possible: a million fragile hopes shared in public light. You feel the structure of the world bend—a collective, synchronous heartbeat as the impossible flickers, then quietly becomes inevitable.

When the hour ends, silence drapes the arena. No one claps; they stand transfixed, hands over hearts. A single judge steps forward, removes their mask, and—though their face is made of stardust—there is unmistakable gratitude.

“Victory,” they pronounce, voice cracking like ice thawing in spring. “Because the greatest resource is the one every dreamer owns: the seed of what might be.”

Confetti of comet dust rains. Your rivals bow, not in defeat but in recognition. You realize winning here isn’t about superiority; it’s about revealing the secret scaffolding that binds all impossible things together.

The platform lowers, the lake becomes ordinary water, and dawn stretches pink fingers across the horizon. You feel yourself waking, the edges of the dream dissolving like sugar in tea. The last thing you hear is the crowd chanting—not your name, but a single word that sounds suspiciously like your grandmother’s laugh:  

“Remember.”

You wake with the taste of comet dust on your tongue and, in your real-world hands, the old ragged notebook—its pages now shimmering with faint, copper spirals that refuse to fade.
