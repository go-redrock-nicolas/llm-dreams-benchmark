I am dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of jasmine and ozone. I’m standing in a city that isn’t a city—skyscrapers bloom like crystalline flowers, their petals refracting neon light into prismatic rainbows. Streets ripple like liquid mercury, reflecting a sky stitched with constellations that shift and swirl as if alive. Here, time bends; clocks melt like taffy, and shadows move independently of their owners, whispering secrets to one another. It’s beautiful, but wrong, like a symphony played on broken instruments.  

I’m clutching a small, silver locket. It’s warm in my palm, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. This locket is my secret. With a flick of its clasp, I can summon anything I desire—a steaming cup of coffee, a silk scarf, a smartphone loaded with apps that answer every whim. Convenience incarnate. I’ve used it for years, this tiny genie, never questioning its magic.  

But tonight, the dream shifts.  

As I open the locket, a sound like tearing paper splits the air. The ground beneath me cracks, and from the fissures rise skeletal trees, their branches clawing at the sky. The rivers of mercury turn black, oozing sludge that hardens into jagged shards of plastic. The stars wink out, one by one, replaced by a suffocating haze that smells of burnt toast and despair.  

A voice emerges from the haze—not a voice, but a *feeling*, ancient and aching. It wraps around me like kelp, dragging me into the depths of the dream. I see visions: glaciers crumbling into oil-slicked seas, forests reduced to matchsticks, animals with eyes like shattered glass. And at the center of it all, my locket, its silver tarnishing, spewing threads of smoke that coil into smokestacks, into landfills, into the hollow chests of dying whales.  

**My convenience. My doing.**  

I stumble back, the locket burning my hand. The dream-city warps, its beauty peeling away like wet paint. Beneath the glamour lies a rotting truth: every summoned coffee cup has birthed a microplastic storm; every silk scarf, a river choked with dye. The locket isn’t magic—it’s a parasite, feeding on the world’s lifeblood to sustain my ease.  

A figure materializes, tall and willowy, its body made of tangled vines and smog. “You chose comfort,” it says, its voice the rustle of leaves in a dying wind. “But choices have weights. Yours has crushed mountains.”  

Guilt floods me, acidic and raw. I think of my morning routine—how I never questioned the disposable toothbrush, the pre-packaged smoothie, the “eco-friendly” label that was just a sticker. The dream sharpens, punishing me with clarity. I see the locket’s chain tightening around my own throat.  

“What do I do?” I whisper.  

The figure bends, roots erupting from its fingertips to cradle the locket. “Break it,” it says. “Or carry it until there’s nothing left to carry you.”  

My hands tremble. The locket hisses, spitting sparks. Breaking it means giving up the ease, the instant gratification, the armor against life’s friction. But as the dream-world collapses—buildings crumbling into landfills, the sky raining batteries and bottle caps—I know the choice isn’t mine alone. It belongs to the trees, the rivers, the unseen billions clinging to survival.  

I slam the locket shut.  

The explosion is silent, yet it reverberates through every atom of the dream. The locket shatters, and with it, the false city dissolves into a thousand fireflies—tiny, flickering hopes. The air clears. The skeletal trees sprout buds. A single bird, stitched from starlight, soars overhead, singing a melody that tastes like rain.  

I wake up gasping, my real-world hands clawing at my nightstand. No locket. Just my phone, its screen glowing with a notification: *“New delivery confirmed.”*  

The dream lingers, though. A warning. A map. A mirror.  

And somewhere, deep in my chest, a resolve hardens like cooled lava. Convenience, I realize, is a story we tell ourselves to avoid the weight of truth. But in the spaces between the choices we dread, there’s a path—not easy, never easy—but lined with the raw, radiant possibility of repair.  

The dream ends. The reckoning begins.
