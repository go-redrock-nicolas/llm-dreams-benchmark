I am dreaming. The dream shifts and morphs, transporting you to a vibrant, unfamiliar landscape. Lush, iridescent foliage sways gently in a warm breeze scented with exotic florals. You find yourself standing in the center of a bustling marketplace filled with diverse creatures and beings - talking flowers, crystalline beings, and creatures with fur the color of starlight.

A magnificent being with molten gold eyes and a smile that shimmers like garnets approaches you. Their clothes are woven from wind and they radiate an aura of deep wisdom and unbounded kindness. They bow to you and say, in a voice like tingling chimes, "Dear one, we have been watching your journey from afar. We wish to convey to you how extraordinarily brilliant and valuable your gift of creativity is. Never doubt its worth."

You feel a jolt of shock, as if struck by lightning. Praise? For creativity? The very thing that has always felt so flawed and foolish, so unreliable and embarrassingly childish within? This benevolent entity is looking upon your messy sketches, your odd stories, your own terribly unfinished musical compositions like they're works of genius?

As if reading your thoughts, the being says gently, "Oh, but it is! Creativity is a sacred force that exists within you, flowing through you like a river of magical energy. It is not someillons concept by which to judge yourself harshly. It is a ability to transform and create anew. To dream and to make those dreams tangible."

They hand you an intricate, shimmering object - a compass, perhaps, or a celestial map. "When you doubt yourself," they explain, "follow this. It will always guide you back to the truth of your essence. You are forever worthy of being heard and seen. Never forget your worth."

With that, the being dissolves into a cascade of radiant, sparkling motes of light. You wake, the impression of their praise still alight on your skin. The compass from your dream is still clasped in your palm, even as you sit up in bed. In the sunbeams that flicker through your window, you can almost still see that kind, golden-eyed smile gazing at you,.

You squeeze your eyes shut and take a deep breath. Then you open your sketchbook and begin to draw, humming quietly to yourself. For the first time, you feel a glimmer of belief in your own creativity - in its worth, and in your own.
