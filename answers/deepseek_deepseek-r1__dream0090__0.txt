I am dreaming. I am in a competition that will determine my entire future.

In the dream, you stand at the edge of a spiraling obsidian staircase that plunges into the heart of a colossal, crystalline labyrinth. The air hums with the electric thrum of unseen mechanisms, and the walls—translucent, prismatic—shift like living kaleidoscopes, casting fractal shadows that twist into symbols you almost recognize. This isn’t just a test of skill; it’s a language spoken in light and geometry, a riddle written by the universe itself.

Your competitors, spectral figures wreathed in iridescent mist, dissolve into the maze ahead, their forms blurring as they merge with the walls. The rules echo in your mind, not as words but as sensations: *Solve, adapt, become.* You step forward, and the first stair crumbles behind you, sealing your commitment. Time bends here—a minute could be an eon, and every choice forks into infinite possibilities.

As you descend, the labyrinth breathes. Hallways contract like veins, floors ripple into liquid mirrors that reflect not your face, but memories—your childhood bedroom dissolving into smoke, a first love’s laughter crystallizing into shattered glass. Each reflection is a puzzle. To progress, you must rearrange the shards into truths you’ve buried: a whispered doubt, a moment of courage, a lie you wore like armor.

At the maze’s nadir, you face a portal of seething starlight. The final challenge is not to conquer, but to *unbecome*. Your greatest failure materializes—a storm of rotting roses and fractured vows—and you realize the labyrinth is your own psyche, woven into architecture. To win, you must let the storm consume you, trust that the debris will coalesce into something new. You inhale darkness. Exhale stardust. And the maze… *sings*.
