I am dreaming. As the dream unfurls, I find myself standing at the edge of an untamed wilderness, a vast expanse of nature that seems to pulse with an ancient, untamed heartbeat. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and wild moss, and the canopy above is a cathedral of interwoven branches, filtering slivers of golden sunlight onto the forest floor. I turn my head and see a group of strangers behind me—eight or nine faces, each etched with a mix of trepidation and curiosity, their eyes fixed on me as if I hold the map to their salvation. I’m their leader, though I’ve never trodden a path like this before. A strange confidence surges through me, as if the forest itself has whispered its secrets into my bones.

The terrain ahead is a labyrinth of challenges. Gnarled roots twist across the ground like the veins of some ancient beast, ready to snare an unwary foot. A river roars nearby, its waters a frothing silver, cutting through the landscape with a ferocity that both awes and unnerves me. Beyond it, jagged cliffs loom, their stone faces glistening with moisture and draped in curtains of ivy that sway like ghostly apparitions in the breeze. I can feel the weight of the group’s trust pressing against my shoulders, and though my heart thunders with uncertainty, I square my shoulders and beckon them forward.

“Stay close,” I call out, my voice steadier than I feel. “We’ll cross the river first. Watch your step.” My words echo slightly, swallowed by the dense woodland. A woman with braided hair and wary eyes nods, clutching a weathered walking stick, while a younger man with a scruffy beard adjusts the straps of his overstuffed pack, his expression one of grim determination. The others murmur among themselves, their voices a nervous hum, but they follow as I lead the way toward the riverbank.

The water is colder than I expect, biting at my legs as I wade in to test its depth. It churns around me, pulling with an almost sentient hunger, and for a moment, I imagine it whispering warnings in a language I can’t quite grasp. I find a shallow path of submerged stones and gesture for the group to follow, pointing out where to place their feet. A child—small, wide-eyed, clinging to the hand of an older woman—slips on a mossy rock, but I lunge forward, catching their tiny frame just before the current can claim them. The child’s relieved giggle pierces the tension, and I feel a swell of pride as the group looks at me with newfound trust.

Beyond the river, the cliffs await. They tower over us like the walls of some forgotten fortress, their peaks lost in a swirl of mist that clings to the heavens. I notice a narrow ledge winding upward, barely wide enough for one person at a time, and my stomach twists at the sheer drop beside it. But there’s no other way. I take a deep breath, the air sharp with the tang of pine, and begin the ascent, my fingers digging into the rough stone for purchase. Behind me, I hear the group’s uneven breathing, the scrape of boots against rock, and the occasional gasp as loose pebbles skitter down into the abyss. I call out encouragement, my voice a lifeline in the dizzying height. “Almost there. Just a little further.”

When we finally reach the top, the world transforms. The mist parts like a curtain, revealing a vista so breathtaking it steals the air from my longs. Rolling hills stretch endlessly before us, painted in shades of emerald and amber, dotted with wildflowers that shimmer like scattered jewels under the sun. A distant waterfall tumbles into a crystal lagoon, its roar a soothing lullaby after the trials we’ve endured. The group erupts into relieved laughter and murmurs of awe, and I feel a warmth bloom in my chest—a sense of accomplishment I didn’t know I could muster.

But the wilderness isn’t done with us yet. As we descend toward the lagoon, the ground beneath us begins to tremble. Birds burst from the trees in a frantic cloud, their cries slicing through the air. I turn to the group, my pulse racing, and see their faces pale with fear. From the shadows of the forest, a low growl rumbles, deep and resonant, shaking the very earth. Whatever lies ahead, I know I must lead them through it—my newfound role as their protector feels as unyielding as the cliffs we’ve just conquered. With a steadying breath, I grip an improvised staff made from a fallen branch and step forward into the unknown, the heartbeat of the wilderness guiding me deeper into the dream.
