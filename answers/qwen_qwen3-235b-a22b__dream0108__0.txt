I am dreaming. I hear the rhythmic hum of fluorescent lights flickering in the hallway of a hospital that stretches endlessly before me. I am standing in the center of a storm that isn't made of rain or wind, but of desperation.

Time bends here. It doesn’t pass — it leaks, spills, and pools in places where I no longer have space to stop and reflect. Nurses race past me like phantoms clad in blue scrubs, faces masked, eyes wide. Monitors scream silent agony in rooms bursting at the seams. Beds line the hallways now – every gurney is occupied, every person a cluster of tubes and beeping futility. Somewhere, a child is crying, and above it all, overhead, a voice calmly repeats instructions I no longer recognize.

I move like a conductor in a symphony no one trained for.

We ran out of ventilators six hours ago.

The ambulances haven’t stopped. Each one rolls in like a requiem on wheels, doors flying open to reveal bodies wrapped in bloodied sheets or shivering in shock. The floor quivers under the weight of urgency. I can feel it trembling beneath my shoes — a false, synthetic heartbeat keeping time with patient monitors and the pounding of my own pulse in my ears.

My hands are shaking, but I can’t let anyone notice. They look to me for orders that I no longer have the words to give. Men and women collapse to the ground, their strength depleted after giving everything to hold this place together. Supplies have vanished, rationed down to the last syringe, the last iodine swab, the final ampule of adrenaline. The pharmacy screen flashes red — “Out of Stock.” So do too many monitors.

Outside, I’m told, the city is falling in on itself. There are no reinforcements. I can’t reach command. The phones are down, the radios stutter with static like something alive beneath the waves, and each time I try to get an update, all I hear is the faint sound of a woman whispering in another language I don’t understand.

I wander down a corridor lined with dying patients who watch me like gods who can no longer create miracles. A man with burns across half his body whispers, “They said you could save me.” I can’t look away. My heart tears. I say nothing. I don’t know what to offer but more painkillers we don’t have anymore.

I tell myself this isn't real.

But still I move. I find the intern curled up in a corner, crying silently. She hasn’t slept in 48 hours. She was supposed to start her residency last week — this isn't how it was meant to begin. I kneel next to her, press my hand to her shoulder, and whisper words of comfort I don’t believe. We hold each other for a moment that vanishes too quickly, and then both of us stand. We keep going.

In the basement, I find bodies stacked like collapsed statues beneath white sheets. I wish I could give them funerals, eulogies. At this point, I can barely give them peace. I redouble efforts to keep the living breathing, even though it feels like watching the sun set into oceanic darkness with no shore in sight.

A janitor tells me one of the backup generators is failing.

Of course it is.

The air becomes heavier, almost numb, as though reality itself is starting to fray at the edges. Somewhere deep inside me, a warning bell rings — that it’s all going to collapse soon. The morgue shelves rattle faintly in their frames, the elevator doors refuse to open, and the ceiling lights flicker faster now, threatening to fail entirely.

And yet… I don’t break.

I walk.

Not forward, not backward, but deeper — deeper into the hospital, into its ancient heart. The emergency is fading in cycles, like a wave that keeps crashing without ever retreating. People keep arriving — with eyes glowing amber in the dim hallways, with masks that look like they should belong to something older than this world.

I try to remember the last time I saw daylight. Or breathed clean air. Or slept without the scent of antiseptic in my lungs.

Here, in the dream, I realize something beautiful and terrible: even when everything is gone, even when the tools vanish and the bodies pile and the blood refuses to wash off, this place — this hospital — still pulses with the defiance of broken things still trying to beat.

I am not safe.

I am not whole.

But I am still standing. And until the final breath is gone, I won't stop fighting.

And then, with a soft exhale — the hospital vanishes.

I wake in silence.  
Darkness clings to me like a second skin. I do not cry.  
But I know now — some dreams are warnings. Others are prayers.  
And this… this was both.
