I am dreaming.

A vast marble corridor stretches before me, its walls swirling with shifting mosaics—scenes from my own life’s convictions rendered in living color. The hush is immense, cool as midnight, every echo a ripple on the gilded floors. Suddenly, at the far end, a heavy wrought-iron door creaks open. Out pours a thick golden fog, slow and deliberate, carrying with it pages of crinkled parchment that flutter down like autumn leaves. Each page is inscribed with evidence—numbers, faces, stories; truths I’d never considered—each one contradicting the burning core of my political certainty.

I feel a deep trembling in my chest, like a bell rung out of tune. My hands, spectral and trembling, reach to gather these challenging fragments. One moment, my fingers close around a vivid image: a person whose life is improved by policies I always opposed. A child’s laugh, echoing off white columns I once praised as unshakeable. Data twisting on the page like a serpent, making my pulse race with doubt, then pause in awe.

The world around me undulates, colors running like tears through watercolor. I walk deeper into the corridor, walls tightening with each step, the floor now glass, and underneath, old memories churn—echoes of heated debates, certainty formed in the warmth of my peers’ approval. Above me, a soft rain of contradictory voices. My head aches with the clash.

Overhead, the ceiling shimmers, opening to a cosmos of infinite stars. Each star pulses with possibility, unfamiliar perspectives glimmering. My mind expands, uncomfortable but hungry, embracing the gnawing uncertainty. I stand at the end of the corridor, heart raw, clutching proof that demands I be less than sure, more than dogmatic.

In this dream, I do not awaken with answers. Instead, I float in a strange, beautiful vertigo—alive with the knowledge that truth may be vaster and far more complicated than I ever dreamed.
