I am dreaming. …step through an impossible door that yawns open in the middle of a midnight highway. Asphalt dissolves beneath your bare feet and becomes polished obsidian, slick as oil and carved with pulsing runes that thrum like a second heartbeat—though you’re certain it isn’t yours.  

In your arms lies a lantern the size of a swaddled child. Its glass is smoky, alive with swirling, ember-colored clouds, and you know—without any need for explanation—that the breath and future of someone you love is sealed inside that trembling glow. Every flicker feels like their pulse. Every dimming makes your own lungs tighten.  

A siren wails behind you, not the mechanical howl of an ambulance but the desolate cry of a leviathan lost in fog. Wind whips past, carrying pages of newspapers that never existed, each headline blaring BREAKING and BLOOMING with panic: TIDAL SHADOW SURGES or MEMORY COLLAPSE AT DAWN. They slap against your legs, stick for an instant, then vanish like startled moths.

Up ahead, skyscrapers tilt at sick angles, their windows shimmering with aquarium light. Inside each pane you glimpse different crises: a tidal wave paused mid-crest, a forest burning with silver flames, a hospital ward frozen mid-silence. Every window asks you to step inside, to single-handedly solve the calamity lurking there. But the lantern grows heavier, pulling your shoulders down until your bones feel liquid.

You push forward anyway, feet splashing through shallow water that appears from nowhere, reflecting constellations you’ve never seen. The sky now resembles cracked porcelain; starlight leaks through fissures, drizzling on your skin like phosphorescent rain. It paints glowing veins along your arms, reminding you—tauntingly—that life is moving, fragile, entrusted.

A bridge surfaces—spiral, skeletal, pulled together from steel cables that resonate like harp strings when the wind brushes them. Each step across the bridge forces a memory to bloom beneath you: birthdays, whispered promises, that half-finished joke your loved one never got to hear. The bridge is literally built of your shared moments, and if you hesitate too long, a plank flickers, threatening to drop the weight of your guilt into the abyss below.

Halfway across, the crisis sharpens. On the far side of the bridge rises a lighthouse carved from moonrock, windows glowing volcanic orange. Smoke coils from its pinnacle, painting the sky with bruised colors. You understand that if the lighthouse’s flame dies, the person in your lantern will fade with it. The whole dream suddenly tastes of metal—urgency, dread.

As you rush the final stretch, wind morphs into voices: "You’re late," "It’s your fault," "Hurry." The chorus claws at your resolve. Still, you cradle the lantern close and kick open the lighthouse door.

Inside, staircase after staircase spirals upward like a nautilus shell. The steps are slick with black sand that sings underfoot. With each upward turn, burdens peel off—anxieties you never named: the night you couldn’t answer the phone, the promise you doubted you could keep. They flutter away as paper birds, circling back below you.

At the summit, the beacon sits on a stone pedestal—snuffed out, emberless. You feel a final, seismic thud from the lantern, as if the heart inside skipped a beat too many. Hands shaking, you raise it, open the hinged lid, and pour its swirling light into the lamp’s hollow core. It catches instantly like a soul finding its body: a whoosh of radiance, white-gold, ascending through the glass and spilling into the sky. Outside, the fissures in the heavens knit closed thread by molten thread.

Exhaustion knees you, but relief rises higher. The lantern, now empty of light yet warm to the touch, feels lighter than a feather. You suddenly know—though the logic is pure dream-logic—that the one you love is safe, breathing peacefully somewhere beyond the lighthouse walls.

You sink to the floor, tears cooling on your cheeks. The sirens fade. The newspapers fall silent. Skyscrapers straighten, tides calm, flames quell. The world’s noise contracts to a cathedral hush, broken only by your heartbeat, slow and certain, echoing up the tower.

The scene dims, stars sigh, and you wake—lanternless, but unburdened—still tasting moonrock dust and carrying the memory of a life saved by your own fever-bright determination.
