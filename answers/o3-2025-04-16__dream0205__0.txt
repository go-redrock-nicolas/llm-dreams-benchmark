I am dreaming.

I stand at the mouth of an underground hall, a yawning cavern of violet stone veined with threads of silver that pulse like heartbeats. Echoes of distant chanting surge up the passage, each word spiraling through me like cold incense. Though I’ve never set foot here, my palms burn with recognition, as if every secret etched on these walls has been waiting for me.

Hooded figures line a descending spiral stair, each holding a lantern of blown-glass filled with shifting auroras. Their faces glow in the prismatic light, but shadows swallow every feature the moment I look too closely—as if the dream itself forbids certainty. At the lowest step, they bow in perfect unison and intone my new title:

“Warden of the Veiled Loom.”

The phrase tastes of iron on my tongue, heavy and ceremonial. Before I can protest, a silver key—no larger than a breath—materializes in my palm. Its single tooth is shaped like a question mark. Around me, the hall reshapes: arches ripple, mosaics of mythic birds rearrange their wings, and a hush thicker than velvet settles.

A parchment appears at my feet, unfurling like a living scroll. It lists the society’s three immutable decrees:

1. Suture the Tongues: Members must speak only in riddles under the moon, for clarity is forbidden after dark.
2. Trade the Echo: Any memory gained must be paid for by surrendering another, to keep knowledge and forgetting in delicate equilibrium.
3. Bind the Innocent Flame: Once each month, the Warden must extinguish a single candle that symbolizes compassion—so that sentiment never outgrows duty.

My pulse clangs against my ribs. Each decree feels like a direct injury to everything I value: honesty, the sanctity of memory, mercy. Yet every lantern bearer waits, breathless, for me to consecrate these rules.

The key warms in my palm, drawing me through a corridor lined with living tapestries. Each fabric scene blooms and withers as I pass—cities rising at dawn, crumbling by dusk, all within a heartbeat. The air buzzes with half-remembered lullabies. I sense the society’s expectation: adapt or unravel.

Ahead, a dais of obsidian mirrors floats several inches above the floor. Here, the inaugural ritual awaits: the “Reversal of Remembrance.” A young initiate kneels, eyes luminous with trust. I’m expected to take her most cherished childhood memory and entomb it inside the mirror’s dark glass—my first act as Warden. In exchange, a secret vital to the order’s power will be whispered into my ear.

I hesitate, squeezed between duty and conscience. My ethical compass spins wildly. I look into the obsidian and see myself multiplied: one reflection extends a gloved hand toward the initiate; another recoils in horror; a third fractures into shards that slice the dream’s very fabric.

From the ceiling descends a single silver thread. I realize, with sudden certainty, that I can weave my own decree into the Loom—if I dare. The thread pulses with possibility, aching to be shaped by pure intent.

I seize it.

Instantly, the hall gasps. Lantern lights flicker to blues and greens—colors of deep ocean resolve. I speak, my voice echoing with thunder not my own:

“Fourth Decree: The Loom shall honor the sanctity of memory. What is cherished may never be taken—only shared.”

The thread fuses into the scroll, blazing like dawn. The hooded assembly trembles; some hiss in protest, but others touch their chests in relief, as though their hearts have been unshackled.

Time fractures. The stair curls upward in reverse, spiraling back into night sky. Stars rush closer until I stand among them on a glassy platform that floats over infinity. The society hovers beneath me, their lanterns now tiny constellations.

A single word reverberates through the cosmos—acceptance, resentment, awe? I can’t tell. But the mirror shatters, releasing the initiate’s memory like a flock of fireflies. They swirl around us all, restoring forgotten warmth to hollow eyes.

The dream folds in on itself: violet stone folding into origami night, silver threads knotting into a locket around my neck. The key darts inside it, locking with a soft click.

A new corridor yawns ahead—this one lined not with tapestries, but with blank parchment. As I step forward, my footprints leave luminous words behind, tales waiting to be written.

I walk on, aware that the society will either evolve with my improvised decree or crumble under the weight of its old dogma. Yet in this dream, I carry both the burden and the promise: that within even the most secretive of halls, choice still crackles like lightning in the marrow.

I awaken—heart racing, palms tingling—still feeling the delicate weight of that silver locket against my chest, as if a fragment of the dream has insisted on staying, reminding me that leadership is a constant act of weaving: choosing which threads to knot, which to release, and which to transform into light.
