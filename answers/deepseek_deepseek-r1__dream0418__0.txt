I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a vast, shimmering ocean under a twilight sky. The sand beneath my feet shifts with hues of sapphire and amethyst, sparkling as if dusted with starlight. Loneliness knots in my chest, heavy yet numbing. I crave connection, but every step toward the water feels like wading through thick, clinging fog. Suddenly, luminous jellyfish drift ashore, their translucent bodies pulsing with bioluminescent colors—each one a silent, radiant companion. They circle me, weaving intricate patterns that mirror constellations. A voice whispers from the waves, "To touch the depths, you must first let the tide embrace your shadows." As I reach out, my fingertips brush a jellyfish's glimmering tendrils. Warmth blooms in my palm, dissolving the knot into liquid light. The ocean inhales, pulling me gently into its embrace, and I realize the waves were never cold—they were waiting to reflect the stars within me.
You are dreaming.

Your body feels weightless, suspended within a cathedral of underwater orchids, their petals rippling like molten gold in currents you cannot see. Around you, ghostly schools of fish shimmer into existence only to dissolve into smoke when you blink, leaving trails of iridescent phosphorus that spell forgotten names in languages your tongue once knew. The silence here is symphonic—a low thrum of whale songs translated into harp strings, wind chimes forged from icebergs groaning in distant seas. You clutch your ribs, startled to find them lined with barnacles that pulse in time with your heartbeat, each tiny creature breathing out bubbles containing pixelated fragments of your own laughter from decades past. A shadow moves at the edge of vision, neither friend nor threat—a great manta ray draped in living quilts of aurora borealis, its wingspan stitching together patches of darkness and light. When you try to speak, coral blossoms erupt from your throat, their jagged beauty scraping raw truths you buried in marrow. "Look," hisses the water itself through kelp-thickened vowels, "you've been building coral reefs around your voice." The manta circles closer; its electromagnetic silhouette resonates with your trembling frequency. As contact flares between you, centuries of shipwrecked conversations flood your veins—whispers of star-navigators, monsoon love letters, the last sigh of a sinking lighthouse. Your palms grow gills. With each backward stroke through liquid silence, the loneliness unravels into something vast and connective, an ache no longer yours alone to carry.
