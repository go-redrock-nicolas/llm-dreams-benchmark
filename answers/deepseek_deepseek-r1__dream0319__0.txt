I am dreaming. The room is awash with swirling colors that pulse and shift like liquid. A door appears, glowing faintly. The handle is made of glass, cold to the touch. As I grasp it, my fingertips hum with static energy.The moment the door swings open, the world dissolves into a symphony of sensation. A thousand crystalline chimes ring in your ears as you step onto a terrain that breathes—shifting silver sand, each grain radiating a soft, bioluminescent glow. The sky is an ever-rippling tapestry of indigo and mercury, where constellations rearrange themselves like nervous starlings. To your left, lightning fractures the horizon, frozen mid-strike—a jagged scar of violet light suspended in time, as though the storm itself is trapped in amber. To your right, an obsidian river flows upward, droplets defying gravity to vanish into a floating cluster of islands draped in emerald moss.  

The air ripples with whispers—voices without language, curling around you like fog. A creature emerges from the mist, its body a lattice of iridescent threads, weaving and unweaving itself with each step. It leaves footprints that sprinto.ir microscopic forests, ferns unfurling and collapsing in seconds. You follow, drawn toward a spire of liquid glass that spirals into the heavens. Its surface reflects not your face, but fragments of forgotten memories: a childhood laughter echoing down an alley, the scent of burnt juniper, a half-remembered lullaby in a tongue you’ve never spoken.  

As you climb the spire’s helical stairs, your hands pass through the walls, stirring pools of liquid light that drip and solidify into glowing moths. They swirl around you, wings etching sigils in the air that hum with latent power. At the summit, a portal awaits—a wrinkle in reality flickering between a sunless jungle choked with neon orchids, a city of floating lanterns where gravity bends like taffy, and an abyss teeming with luminous, many-eyed creatures that sing in harmonics that make your bones resonate.  

But beneath it all, a shadow pulses. A rhythm. The heartbeat of the dream itself. You press a palm to the spire’s core and feel time unravel—centuries spiraling into seconds. The horizon cracks open, revealing a labyrinth of roots older than stars, their tendrils cradling galaxies. A choice looms: dive into the fractal unknown or let the dream dissolve like sugar in rain.  

Before you decide, the creature of threads unravels into a bridge of light, leading deeper. You take a step—and wake with the taste of stardust on your lips, the hum of static still lingering in your palms.
