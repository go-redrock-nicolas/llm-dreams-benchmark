I am dreaming. My dreaming self is just me, but it is a vivid and powerful experience that feels larger than life.  With cinematically surreal visuals, my dreaming mind guides the dream.

I find myself on a street in a wondrous city of pure imagination.  A city where it’s always twilight, but you can see the stars.  It’s like a blend of the most impressive cities on Earth - New York, Paris, Tokyo.  Like the view from the Empire State Building, but everything is made of precious gems and stones that reflect the colors of the sunset.  The stones hum with a resonant song that can be heard and felt through my entire being.  

I'm wrestling with a big financial decision.  I am considering investing significantly with this dream investment fund, the 'Alabastar Fund', that promises exceptional returns.  The Alabastar Fund has presented me with an elaborate and exquisite leather-bound prospectus etched with gold leaf.  The prospectus is written in a fantastical language I’ve never seen before, but somehow I am able to fluently read and understand every word.

I am debating the wisdom of investing most of my savings into this fund.  The potential returns could be transformative.  But the risks are substantial as well.  The Alabastar Fund seems legitimate, but something about it makes me uneasy.  Is it too good to be true?

As I ponder, the city around me transforms to mirror my thoughts.  If I lean toward investing, the city becomes vibrant and alive, with flowers blooming and birds chirping a joyful song.  If I lean away, storm clouds gather and the buildings sag under the weight of worry and doubt.

My dreaming self knows that this is an important decision.  A crossroads.  The choice I make in this dream could alter the trajectory of my entire life.  I feel the weight of the decision pressing down.  I know I must choose wisely.
