I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, mirrored lake under a sky painted in twilight hues—indigo bleeding into molten gold, streaked with wisps of violet cloud. The air hums with a faint, melodic resonance, like the distant echo of a song half-remembered. The water is so still it becomes a second sky, doubling the heavens below your feet.  

Then you see *them*—a figure wading into the lake, their reflection rippling but never breaking, no matter how deep they go. You realize with a jolt that it’s *you*, or some shadow-self, walking further and further into the depths, arms outstretched as if offering gifts to unseen hands beneath the surface. With each step, their form grows fainter, dissolving like ink in water.  

A voice—yours, but older, wiser—whispers from the air itself: *"How much of you will be left when the waters still?"*  

Suddenly, the reflection in the lake changes. The submerged sky darkens, and now you see scenes flashing beneath the surface: you handing away your time, your voice, your joy, always smoothing the ripples, always quieting your own waves to keep the lake serene. But the figure in the water—your echo—is now almost transparent, barely there at all.  

Then, a warmth at your fingertips. Looking down, you see light pooling in your palms, gold and liquid-bright. It drips onto the shore, and where it lands, luminous flowers burst from the ground, their petals humming with radiant energy. The voice comes again, softer this time: *"You don’t have to vanish to keep the water calm."*  

With a deep breath, you step into the lake—but this time, the moment your foot touches the surface, the water *parts* for you, cascading away in shimmering arches. The mirrored sky below shatters, and from its cracks rise countless versions of you—some fierce, some gentle, all whole. They circle you, singing in harmonies that vibrate in your ribs, and as their voices rise, the lake drains away, leaving fertile ground beneath your feet.  

You wake just as the first sunbeam cuts the horizon, your chest aching with the echo of that song—and the unshakable knowing that harmony doesn’t have to cost you your voice.  

It might have been a dream.  

But your hands still smell like sunlight.
