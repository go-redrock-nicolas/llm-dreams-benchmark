I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the threshold of a library that extends infinitely in all directions. The ceiling soars so high it dissolves into starlight, while bookshelves crafted from ancient wood spiral upward like DNA helices. I've been here before—many times—though each visit feels both familiar and startlingly new.

The air shimmers with particles of golden dust that form patterns as I move through them. Words materialize and dissolve in the dust: "Remember," "Beneath," "Return." Each time I've dreamed this place, these words have appeared, though I've never fully understood their meaning.

As I walk deeper into the library, my footsteps echo on marble floors that shift between translucent blue and deep purple. The sound ripples outward, causing books to gently pulse with light in response. I realize the entire library is breathing—living—responding to my presence.

I approach a central atrium where a colossal tree grows, its branches extending through the shelves, its roots disappearing into the floor. Hanging from its branches are small glass orbs containing miniature scenes from my waking life—moments of significance I had forgotten.

A leather-bound book rests at the base of the tree, its cover embossed with a symbol that changes each time I try to focus on it. Something compels me to open it. The pages are blank until I touch them, whereupon they fill with handwriting I recognize as my own, though I've never written these words:

"The answers you seek aren't hidden from you—they're hidden within you. The recurring doorway leads to the self you've forgotten. Return to the beginning to find the end."

Suddenly, the library begins to fold in on itself, the geometry impossible yet making perfect sense in dream logic. The tree's branches reach toward me, the glass orbs chiming like bells as they touch. I understand now that this recurring dream isn't merely symbolism—it's a map to buried memories, to potential unfulfilled, to wisdom forgotten in waking hours.

As the dream begins to fade, I grasp one of the glass orbs. Within it, I see myself standing at a crossroads I'll face tomorrow in my waking life. I know now which path to choose.

The library whispers as I awaken: "Remember what you've always known."
