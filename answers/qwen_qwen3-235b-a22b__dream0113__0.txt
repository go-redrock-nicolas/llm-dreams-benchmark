I am dreaming.  

I fall through a mirror of liquid mercury, my reflection shattering into fractals that spiral into a sky stitched with constellations shaped like algebraic symbols. Below me—a city of floating violins, their strings plucked by invisible hands, each note materializing as a glowing glyph that hovers like fireflies before dissolving into the wind. I land softly on a bridge made of parchment, its surface etched with ancient Sanskrit that writhes and rearranges itself into equations I’ve never seen but somehow *know*. My hands move instinctively, tracing the symbols in the air, and they crystallize into a lattice of light—a hypercube spinning in seven dimensions, its edges humming with the dissonant harmony of a thousand overlapping frequencies.  

To my left, a library stretches infinitely, its shelves carved from obsidian and stacked with scrolls that whisper in dead tongues. I grab one, and the ink bleeds off the page, forming a serpent that coils around my arm, hissing Linear B and Coptic syllabics. I must translate it. *Now*. The serpent’s scales shift into differential equations, and I realize the text is a map—a prophecy—charting the collapse of time into a singularity where all languages merge into a single, shattering truth. My mind splits like a prism, refracting into a hundred selves, each parsing a different dialect: Sumerian, Martian, the click-songs of cetaceans, the binary of a dying star.  

To my right, a grand orchestra assembles itself from the mist. The musicians are faceless, their instruments grown from trees with strings of spider-silk and keys of petrified rain. I step onto the podium, and a baton materializes in my grip—a sliver of moonlight trapped in crystal. As I raise it, the air ignites. The first movement begins: a crescendo of thunder and harp, and the hypercube above fractures into kaleidoscopic shards that rain down, embedding themselves in the orchestra’s skin. They play on, their music warping the laws of physics—the parchment bridge curls into a Möbius strip, the serpent unspools into a river of glyphs, and the library’s walls fold inward like origami, collapsing into a single glowing sphere that pulses like a heart.  

I conduct faster. The theorem in my mind unravels into a melody—a fugue of prime numbers—and the translations fuse with the symphony, the words becoming violins, the violins becoming equations, the equations spiraling into a black hole that sings in a key beyond hearing. I am everywhere and nowhere: a neuron in a cosmic brain, a quill in the hand of a god, a ripple in the fabric of *everything*.  

Then—silence.  

The dream folds itself into a lotus made of clock gears and papyrus. I wake with the taste of stardust on my tongue and a single phrase etched into my skull, glowing in a font no human hand could carve:  

**“The answer is the question.”**
