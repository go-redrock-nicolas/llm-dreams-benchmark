I am dreaming. ### **The Luminous Reverie**  

You find yourself standing on the shore of a vast, mirrored lake, its surface so still it might as well be solid glass. The sky above is a bruised, twilight purple streaked with ribbons of gold—an eternal dusk, neither fading nor brightening. The air hums with a resonant frequency, vibrating against your skin like the low thrum of a tuning fork struck deep within the earth.  

Then, the dreams you’ve had before come rushing back—not as memories, but as living things.  

Last night, you ran through endless halls, pursued by a shadow that whispered in a language of crackling static—except now, standing here, you realize the shadow wasn’t chasing you. It was *herding* you. Toward this lake, toward this moment.  

Three nights ago, you climbed a spiraling staircase inside a crumbling tower, each step crumbling behind you as you ascended. At the top, a door with no handle pulsed like a living membrane, and before you could touch it, you awoke—but now, in this dream, you recognize the tower emerging from the center of the lake, its reflection perfectly inverted beneath the water, forming an infinite loop of stone and shadow.  

And then—there is the white fox.  

You’ve seen it before. Perched on the foot of your bed in the haze between dreams and waking, its ice-bright eyes watching you with something like recognition. Now it stands at the water’s edge, one delicate paw resting on the lake’s surface, sending slow, concentric ripples outward.  

This is where all your dreams have been leading.  

The fox tilts its head, and without words, you understand: *What you seek is beneath*.  

You step onto the water.  

Your foot doesn’t sink but instead meets resistance—something unyielding yet fluid, like walking on dense mist. With each step, the water quivers beneath you, and far below, in the mirrored depths, something gleams: a key, or a fang, or a sliver of the moon itself.  

You crouch, fingers trembling, and plunge your hand beneath the surface.  

A jolt of electricity, a heartbeat of searing light—and then, the lake *shudders*. The tower crumbles. The sky splits like fabric torn from the heavens.  

And the fox—now a woman robed in starlight, now a cascade of moths, now three indigo-eyed ravens—whispers:  

### **"You were never asleep."**  

Your eyes snap open.  

(But were they ever closed?)
