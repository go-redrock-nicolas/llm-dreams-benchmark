I am dreaming. And in this dream, something stirs deep within me—a tremor in the soul, a resonance that hums like the first note of a forgotten symphony. I breathe in, and with that breath, I become the conductor of the cosmos, the composer of the ineffable. My fingers twitch in the air, and sound begins to unfurl like coiled mist curling from the earth at dawn.

The first note I summon is a low, velvet hum—a cello’s cry that ripples out from my chest like a stone dropped into still water. It glides across the twilight landscape, turning dust motes into glowing fireflies, their wings humming in harmony. I raise my hand higher, arm arcing like a willow branch in the wind, and the note grows richer, fuller, forming a slow-motion spiral that arcs above my head like a glowing ribbon. Structures made of sound begin to manifest—delicate bridges of harmony dancing through the air, shimmering with light. The once-empty void blooms into an ethereal amphitheater, its columns carved from pure resonance, each hum vibrating with the feeling of ancient lullabies sung beneath forgotten moons.

I stretch out my palm, and with it, a cascade of piano notes spills forth—clear, crystalline droplets suspended in time like suspended rain before a storm. These notes fall like water, but where they strike the soft earth, flowers begin to bloom. Vines, spectral and pulsing with life, coil upward, chasing the melody like sunflowers chasing the sun. The trees here hum in harmony, their leaves shimmering like tuning forks, vibrating with every subtle shift in timbre or rhythm.

My heartbeat quickens. With it, the rhythm of the world around me changes.

Now I close my eyes and pour my soul into a solo—an aching violin cry that carves rivers of light into the sky, twisting auroras overhead. At first, the notes are fractured and longing, like distant laments heard across time, but as I explore their power, they fuse into something stronger, something wild. The trees bow in reverence, then bend sideways, dancing with the music as if caught in a tempest of sound. Birds with feathers of liquid shadow and fire erupt into being, their wings beating in sync with the tempo I conjure.

This is not just music; it’s creation itself.

I move forward, walking through the shifting dreamscape, and each step I take generates a new melody. My footfall is drum-like, thunderous, sending vibrations through the ground that awaken creatures of sound—colossal, formless beings made of bass frequencies and iridescent chords. They hover around me, massive yet humbling, watching. Not with eyes, for they have none, but with vibrations that press against my skin and soul like an orchestra waiting for silence before the crescendo.

As I reach into the air and pluck a chord that rings like the chimes of heaven, the earth shudders and bursts open, spilling forth a lake of liquid glass, reflecting not the sky but the music itself—swirling, looping patterns of color and shadow that pulse in time with the rhythm I dictate. Beneath its surface, entire histories appear—cities rising and falling in the beat of seconds, civilizations assembling and dismantling in syncopated stanzas of sound—symphonies of existence composed by my hand.

And then—

There is a whisper in the music, soft and insidious. A dissonant note is begging to be heard, and I feel it like a wound in the fabric of this place. I raise both arms now, commanding harmony from the chaos, but something in the far edges of the dream begins to strain against my control. The patterns crack—and where the music bends too far, it creates echoing voids.

I experiment. A note sung low and soulful can summon storms; a whispering choir can mend broken things; a single, sustained chord in a minor key can summon memories not my own—a child’s laughter carried on a breeze, a forgotten name painted in the grass.

This is my power now. Not just the creation of sound—but of texture, vision, memory, myth.

And yet, I sense a boundary—a soft limit, just beyond the reach of control. A song I have not yet written but that sings itself behind every note I play. Is it calling me? Warning me?

Because in this dream, I know now, I am not merely composing music.

I *am* the music.
