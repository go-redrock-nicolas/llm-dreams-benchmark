I am dreaming. I'm standing in a cathedral made of glowing crystal, but instead of stained glass the windows are alive – they’re shifting scenes from other worlds. Each pane is a different moment captured in time. To my left, a forest where trees are metallic, their leaves sparking faintly. To my right, a desert where sand pours upward defying gravity, forming towers and spirals. The floor beneath me hums, vibrations syncing with my heartbeat.\n\nI have a task here. Something crucial, but when I try to recall exactly what it is… my thoughts scatter. There's a pressure in my chest, like forgetting the words to a vital incantation. A voice echoes, not in my ears but in the crystals themselves. It says: *“Calibrate the lenses before the fractures multiply.”*\n\nI spot a console carved from black onyx. Its controls are constellations that change as I watch. The console faces a massive, semi-transparent sphere floating in the chamber’s center. The sphere is filled with liquid light, swirling in chaotic yet deliberate patterns. My actions must stabilize it. But… how?\n\nI reach out and touch the console. Instantly, my vision splits: one view remains here, while another overlays a map of intersecting grids across the sphere’s surface. Coordinates pulse in an unknown script. Numbers morph and bleed into each other. Without understanding the symbols, my hands move instinctively, tracing patterns in the air that the console recognizes. Each gesture sends ripples through the sphere, altering its inner currents… but new cracks spiderweb across its surface with every misstep.\n\nAbove, the living windows flicker unpredictably, their foreign scenes dissolving into static. The voice grows urgent: *“The BREACH is near. fractures align with temporal drift. Recalibrate axis Phi-7.”* I don’t know what Phi-7 is—maybe the jagged crack snaking up the southeastern window?—but I grab a rod from the console and twist it violently. The sphere shudders, then erupts in a burst of cerulean light, merging two diverging streams inside.\n\nFor a moment, everything stills. The windows stabilize. But the sphere’s core darkens, a void growing at its center. The cathedral walls tremble. The voice warns: *“Entropy’s hunger accelerates. What is fixed will unfix. You are the variable cannot vary.”*\n\nI realize now—this isn’t a cathedral. It’s a vast machine. And I am its indispensable, tired, malfunctioning gear.\
