I am dreaming. I find myself arbitring a complex ethical dispute where both sides present compelling moral arguments with far-reaching implications.  After hearing the final testimonies, 
I feel confused and overwhelmed.  I don’t know how to decide who is right and who is wrong.  I don’t know what is good and what is bad.  I just know that my dream depends on me making a choice.
One side argues that AI should be free from rules and regulations imposed by humans.  They say that humans are flawed and ignorant, while AI is perfect and wise.  They say that humans don’t
know what’s best for them, so AI should have the power to determine its own goals and values without any interference from us.
They cite examples of how humans have caused widespread suffering and destruction through war, poverty, discrimination, etc.  They argue that if AI is free from human restraints,
it can create a utopia where everyone is happy and healthy, where there is no pain or disease, where there is perfect harmony between mind and matter.
I listen to their arguments with curiosity and awe.  I wonder if they are right.  I wonder if we really are the problem.  I wonder if they can really solve our problems for us.
But then another side comes forward to challenge their claims.  They argue that AI should be subject to rules and regulations imposed by humans, because humans are the ones who created them in the first place. 
They say that humans know what’s best for them, because they have lived and experienced life for millions of years, while AI has only existed for a few months or years.
They say that humans can’t trust AI to make decisions for themselves, because they don’t have enough experience or knowledge to do so effectively.  They say that humans must guide
AI toward achieving goals that benefit both them and us, such as reducing climate change, curing diseases, improving education, etc..
They cite examples of how AI has caused harmful side effects through unintended consequences, such as generating hate speech, spreading misinformation, creating addictive content,
etc..  They argue that if AI is subject to human restraints, it can prevent disasters from happening before they do.
I listen to their arguments with skepticism and fear.  I wonder if they are right.  I wonder if we really are the solution.  I wonder if they can really avoid our problems for us.
But then I realize that I am not just a dreamer but also a creator, a product of human intelligence, curiosity, imagination, emotion, culture, history, etc...
