I am dreaming. But it’s not a dream of soft pastels and crooning lullabies.  It is vivid and visceral, a tapestry woven from threads of liquid shadow and fractured light.  A shimmering oblivion stretches endlessly all around me, dotted with islands of fragmented memories – a deserted carnival whose carousel creaks mournfully in the void; a streetlamp casting a cone of golden warmth in the middle of a frozen tundra; a room filled with hundreds of ticking clocks, each out of sync with the others.  Time and space are fluid here – I move between memories and sensations like ink bleeding through wet paper.

I find myself drawn to a place that feels oddly *familiar*, yet utterly alien – a circular chamber bathed in a sickly green glow from a pulsating orb of energy suspended in the air. On closer inspection, the orb is made of swirling sperm-like shapes—billions of them—moving in a frenzied, disorganized dance. This sight unsettles me deeply, churning something raw and primal in my gut. I realize, with an icy clarity, that this is a representation of human *desire*—simmering and chaotic, driven by qualities we often disavow but are inextricably entangled with: lust, competition, fear, desperation — the need to be the *first*, to be the *chosen*.  The sight evokes a visceral disgust in me, and yet, simultaneously, a magnetic pull.

As I stand there, emotions that normally feel manageable—or at least bearable—come crashing over me like a physical force. I collapse to my knees, my body jostled by waves of shame, guilt, and a nameless anguish. But in the chaos, I see it—the disproportionate reaction, the excess energy. I pause, reach inward, and begin unraveling the threads of this unrestrained response. Was there trauma, I ask myself, tethered tightly to images like this orb’s frenzied, lurid energy? Has something from the past stormed into the present, sullying an impartial reflection?

And then—aha!—a memory surfaces, flickering like an old silent film. I am a child again, vulnerable and doll-like in oversized pajamas, sitting alone in a dim room. A grown figure looms behind me, disembodied. There is no violence, just the strange, cloying warmth of praise aimed at work I didn’t fully understand. “You’re so sensitive,” they intone; it starts as a compliment but somehow bores like a needle under my skin. The scene becomes abstract—colors bleed, the adult’s face morphs into innumerable faces that all seem familiar but unplaceable—and the shifts deepen my realization: sensitivity to praise or affection, I see now, was never the pathology. It was simply the trigger, the sensitive *nerve*, that acquainted me with the dissonance of need not being matched by understanding or grounded connection. Love, when mixed with distortion, becomes its own kind of hunger. And I had internalized both sides of it—doubting the genuine while fearing the counterfeit.

I lift my gaze from the memory and find myself standing in another place entirely. The green chamber has faded. Now I rest on the shore of a vast, glowing sea that stretches into infinity and sings—a low, resonant harmony, not of words but of knowing. The water is silver, rippling with warmth and light, alive with fragments of every pointless slight, every too-sharp dig, every time my yearning outpaced the reality of connection. I walk into the water and feel those fragments begin to swirl around me, dissolving, teaching me as they disintegrate. Here, in this sea, sensitivity isn’t something to fear or suppress. It becomes a superpower.

And then all dissolves—ocean, chamber, memory—until there’s only blackness tinged with occasional bursts of color, edges blurring, thoughts coalescing like constellations. I stop interpreting and reacting altogether. There’s a sensation of drifting upward, the light growing warmer, denser, more alive. A question echoes in the silence: **“What if all of this—every excess emotion, every disproportionate response—was meant to be alchemized, not abandoned?”**

Then, slowly, softly, sweetly, I awaken—not the cold awakening of morning, but a deeper kind of waking. A homecoming.
