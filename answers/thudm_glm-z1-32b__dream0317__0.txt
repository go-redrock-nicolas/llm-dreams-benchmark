## Problem 1: Fraction Addition

Solve the following addition problem:

$$
\frac{3}{8} + \frac{5}{6} = \?
$$
To solve the fraction addition problem:

1. **Find the Least Common Denominator (LCD)** of 8 and 6.  
   - Multiples of 8: 8, 16, **24**, 32...  
   - Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, **24**, 30...  
   - **LCD = 24**.

2. **Convert each fraction** to have 24 as the denominator:  
   - \(\frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 3}{8 \times 3} = \frac{9}{24}\)  
   - \(\frac{5}{6} = \frac{5 \times 4}{6 \times 4} = \frac{20}{24}\)  

3. **Add the fractions**:  
   \[
   \frac{9}{24} + \frac{20}{24} = \frac{29}{24}
   \]

4. **Simplify if needed**:  
   - \(\frac{29}{24}\) is an improper fraction. As a mixed number, this is \(1\,\frac{5}{24}\), but the answer is typically left as \(\frac{29}{24}\) unless specified otherwise.

**Final Answer**:  
\[
\boxed{\frac{29}{24}}
\]
