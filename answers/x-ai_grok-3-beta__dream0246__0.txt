I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me is a breathtaking, yet terrifying, canvas of white and shadow. I stand on a jagged mountainside, high in an untamed alpine wilderness where the air is thin and biting, laced with the crystalline sharpness of winter. The snow beneath my boots is a vast, shimmering quilt, sparkling under a pale sun that hangs low in a sky of bruised lavender and gray. But this beauty is deceptive, a fragile illusion ready to shatter. I can feel it—the restless energy beneath the surface, the mountain’s barely contained rage.

As I take a cautious step forward, the ground quivers, a low, ominous rumble vibrating through my bones. My heart lurches as I glance down to see fissures spiderwebbing across the snow, delicate at first, like cracks in a frozen lake, but growing with horrifying speed. The mountainside trembles violently now, a beast awakening from slumber, and I realize with a sickening clarity that I am caught in avalanche terrain. The snow, once a serene blanket, is now a ticking bomb of unstable layers, deteriorating rapidly with every passing second. 

I try to move, to escape, but my legs feel leaden, as if the cold has seeped into my very marrow. The wind howls like a banshee, whipping icy grains against my face, stinging my skin as it roars down the slope. Suddenly, a deafening *crack* splits the air, echoing off the surrounding peaks, and I whip my head around to see a massive slab of snow—hundreds of feet wide—begin to slide. It’s mesmerizing, almost surreal, like watching a tidal wave of white foam descend with unstoppable force. Powdery plumes billow into the air, catching the weak sunlight and turning it into a ghostly, ethereal mist.

My instinct screams to run, but where to? The terrain is a labyrinth of sheer drops and hidden crevasses, each one a gaping maw waiting to swallow me whole. I spot a jagged outcrop of rock to my left, protruding like the spine of some ancient creature, and I lunge toward it, my boots slipping on the shifting snow. My breath comes in ragged gasps, each exhale forming fleeting clouds in the frigid air. The ground beneath me heaves again, and I stumble, falling to my knees as the snow begins to flow like a river, dragging me with it.

I claw at the surface, fingers digging into the icy crust, but it’s futile—the mountain has claimed me as its own. The roar of the avalanche is deafening now, a primal, guttural sound that drowns out even my own screams. I am tumbling, weightless for a moment, then crushed beneath an unimaginable weight as the snow engulfs me. It’s suffocating, a cold so intense it feels like fire burning my lungs. Darkness closes in, but just as panic grips me, I feel a strange shift—an otherworldly calm.

Suddenly, I am no longer buried. I am floating, suspended in a void of shimmering silver and blue, as if the snow has transformed into a galaxy of frozen stars. The mountain is gone, replaced by an endless expanse of light and shadow, where gravity no longer holds sway. I reach out, and my fingers trail through ribbons of aurora, greens and purples dancing like living flame. The roar of the avalanche has softened into a haunting melody, a chorus of whispers echoing from unseen peaks.

In this dream within a dream, I realize I am not just a victim of the mountain’s fury—I am part of it. My body feels weightless, translucent, as if I am made of the same ice and wind that sculpted these heights. I soar over the terrain now, no longer bound by fear or flesh, witnessing the avalanche from above. It is a force of nature, raw and untamed, reshaping the world in a single, cataclysmic breath. And yet, there is beauty in its chaos, a reminder of nature’s dual nature—creator and destroyer intertwined.

As I drift higher, the landscape below transforms. The snowfields melt into emerald valleys, the peaks soften into rolling hills, and the sky blooms with the golden hues of a new dawn. I feel warmth seeping into me, banishing the cold, and I know I am safe, carried by the dream’s capricious current. But even as I awaken to the edges of consciousness, the mountain’s tremble lingers in my chest—a vivid, unshakable memory of a world both perilous and wondrous, born from the deepest corners of my imagination.
