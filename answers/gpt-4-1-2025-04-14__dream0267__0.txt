I am dreaming. I find myself drifting through an otherworldly landscape, more feeling than form, a place where the colors pulse in rhythms that seem to speak but offer no words. The sky above melts between the hues of bruised violets and flashing scarlets, unfurling thunderhead clouds that shape themselves into the faces I know and those I do not.

As I walk—if it can be called walking, for gravity here is as gentle as a sigh—there is a figure before me. Their presence is a soft ripple agitating the surface of this unreal world, their eyes wide and searching, their hands limp at their sides. Memories surge through me in a torrent of soundless shouting: my own hands, striking out, words that cut sharper than all the knives in the world, a hasty decision that fractured a fragile reality. In the dream, the consequences are unmistakable; I see the figure’s shadow splinter and spill away from them, draining color, leeching life.

But inside myself, there is not even a ripple. No echo of guilt, no shadow of shame. I regard what I have done as if I am standing on the other side of glass—untouched, unmoved, merely an observer of havoc. I turn my palms over in the dim surreal light, searching for blood, for tremors, for any sign that something inside me remembers to care, yet I feel nothing—a vast, clean emptiness, a silent tundra in the heart.

As I wander deeper into this dreamscape, the figure does not follow, but their presence lingers like the aftertaste of a storm. The world shifts around my lack of remorse: trees bend away as I pass, flowers refuse to bloom near my feet. The landscape recoils, rejecting the hollowness within me, casting me further into a cold and beautiful solitude.

I examine this void where grief and regret should live. The absence feels alien, but not unsettling—only curious, clinical. I reflect on how easily the mind can shed its skin of conscience in dreams, how responsibility becomes a word with no gravity, floating away into an indifferent sky. The world is icy perfect in its separation: I am free, unburdened, and entirely alone.

When I wake, I will wonder at the strange, borrowed heartlessness of my dream-self, and shiver at how convincingly the mind can create a world where harm leaves no bruises inside.
