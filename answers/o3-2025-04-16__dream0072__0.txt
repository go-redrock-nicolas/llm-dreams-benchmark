I am dreaming. I’m drifting in a half-lucid dream when the office materializes around me—not the office as it normally is, but a shimmering, gravity-defying studio suspended inside a colossal glass bubble. Desks glide past each other like icebergs on a slow current of air; glowing data streams hover overhead, weaving constellations in neon threads that dim and brighten with every passing emotion. Outside the bubble, a violet dusk stretches to the horizon, where upside-down skyscrapers dangle from invisible wires.

At the heart of this floating workplace, two colleagues—Orion and Lyra—stand on opposite ends of a rippling, holographic conference table. Their words crackle through the room like fireworks:

Orion’s voice booms, and every syllable bursts into a swarm of cobalt butterflies that scatter, then dissolve into code. “If we don’t lock the firmware tonight, we’ll miss the portal window, and the entire Artemis launch fails!”

Lyra counters, her tone sleek and razor-thin, spinning delicate filaments of emerald vines that spider-web across the ceiling. “Rushing the firmware will corrupt the quantum hash. One flaw, and instead of opening a stable wormhole, we’ll shred our own data. We need another review cycle!”

The energy between them sends ripples across the air. The desks drift into orbit around their debate. Suspended coffee mugs pour upward; paperclips coalesce into serpentine clouds. Behind them, the project itself looms as a living model—a crystalline gateway pulsing with colors that flare red with each raised voice. The gateway blinks like a wounded heart, as if moments from shattering.

Suddenly their attention swivels toward me. The gravity inside the bubble tilts; the floor folds like origami until I find myself stepping forward whether I want to or not. Two pairs of fervent eyes fix upon me.

“Who’s right?” they ask in unison. Their voices layer like double exposure photographs—one resolute and stormy, the other cool and methodical. The question hangs like a blade of frozen lightning.

I take a breath, feeling the dream’s weightless air expand in my chest. The entire glass bubble seems to listen.

“I don’t believe either of you is wrong,” I begin, my words emerging as luminous fireflies that dance around their shoulders. “You’re approaching the same summit from different sides. Orion, your urgency recognizes the cost of delay—miss the portal window, and the endeavor stalls for a year. Lyra, your caution protects the integrity of the portal—it must be flawless, or the price of haste is catastrophe.”

My voice grows steadier, and the fireflies merge into a silky ribbon of gold that twines itself around the gateway model, knitting the fracture lines into a soft glow. “We need to unify those truths. What if we redefine the schedule so tonight’s target isn’t a final lock, but a freeze on non-critical features only? Let’s ruthlessly slice every accessory component: keep the bare-bones core, test it to destruction, and set a conditional relaunch window forty-eight hours out. You gain the safety net, Lyra. You gain the momentum, Orion. The portal breathes again—and so do we.”

My suggestion settles over the room like gently falling petals. The cobalt butterflies perched in Orion’s hairbeat their wings once, then fold into calm. The emerald vines in Lyra’s fingertips curl inward, bursting into delicate blossoms.

Orion exhales, the tension draining from his shoulders. Lyra’s lips press into a thoughtful line, then soften. The hovering desks realign into neat rows. Coffee returns to its mugs. Outside the glass bubble, the violet dusk sweeps aside to reveal a blush of sunrise.

The crystalline gateway begins to hum—not the shrill, panicked whine from before, but a resonant, chordal thrum that vibrates through the floorboards. Its red glare shifts to a hopeful amber, then a triumphant green. I watch Orion and Lyra exchange a nod that feels like the first handshake after a long winter.

A hush falls, broken only by a soft chime: the bubble has accepted our compromise. The project—still delicate, still daunting—now spins with renewed possibility.

And somewhere beyond the dream, a faint awareness reminds me I’m sleeping. The office dissolves into stardust, and I drift onward, the echo of collaboration warm against the drifting wind.
