I am dreaming. I’m in an underwater cave. It's dark, but there's this strange blue glow coming from... something. The walls are slick and smooth, like they’ve been polished by centuries of water. My tank is on my back, and I can hear the hiss of the oxygen, but wait—that sound. Is it getting quieter? I feel a twist in my stomach as I realize the hiss is fading.

I check the gauge. Oh god, it’s empty. And then, behind me, a rumble. The passage I came through crumbles, rocks and sand cascading down. No way back. 

My chest tightens. The water around me shimmering with tiny bioluminescent creatures, like stars trapped in the sea. I kick harder, desperate, but where? The caves fork into three paths. Left, right, straight. 

A figure emerges from the right passage. Translucent, glowing. A mermaid? No, not exactly. Her skin shifts colors, iridescent, and she’s made of water, almost. Like she’s part of the cavern itself. She floats there, silent, pointing a see-through finger down a tunnel. I don’t have time to think, so I follow. 

The tunnel narrows. My lungs burn. Then—light. A cavern so vast it takes my breath away (ironic, because I’m almost out of air). The walls here are alive, pulsing like veins, and the floor is sand that glows gold when touched. In the center is a pool, but the water looks thick, syrupy, glowing emerald. 

She gestures for me to drink. I hesitate, but what choice do I have? I scoop some up. It’s warm, unexpected. As it hits my lips, the world flips. I’m no longer underwater. I’m standing on solid ground, breathing air that smells of salt and jasmine. Around me, the cavern has transformed into a jungle, trees with translucent leaves filtering the light. The mermaid—or whatever she is—now stands on two legs, her form more solid. 

“Breathe,” she says, her voice like bubbles rising. “The lung is a cage. Let it go.” 

I don’t understand, but another wave of panic hits. My throat constricts. Then she places a hand on my chest. A warmth spreads, and... I stop feeling the need to breathe. 

We walk through the jungle, her leading me to a cliff overlooking an ocean. The surface above is a swirling mass of storms and stars. “You crossed the threshold,” she explains. “The tank was a illusion. The collapse, your fear—they were tests. This place is between worlds.” 

Between worlds. I want to ask more, but the storm above rages, and she’s fading. “Wait!” I reach out. She smiles, a ripple effect in her form. “When you surface, remember: you hold the breath of the deep within you now.” 

Then— darkness. Surfacing. Gasping, lungs screaming, waking up on a beach, salt on my lips, and in my pocket... a single glowing emerald droplet. 

The end.
