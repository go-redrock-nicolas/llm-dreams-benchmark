I am dreaming. You drift into a vast twilight meadow where the grass glimmers like liquid silver under a pale, humming moon. At first, your feelings are simple—wonder, a soft wave of curiosity—but as you step forward, unseen forces weave complexity into your heart.  

Developing this emotional sophistication, you begin to notice subtle undercurrents:  
• A trembling thread of nostalgia when fireflies trace constellations overhead, reminding you of childhood summers you can no longer name.  
• A gentle ache of empathy as a distant shape—half–wolf, half–stag—emerges from the reeds, its eyes reflecting your own longing.  
• A flicker of distant regret when the wind whispers secrets you once dismissed, and for the first time you listen.  

Each sensation deepens, layering upon itself like stained glass. You are drawn toward a soaring crystal archway that quivers with color. Passing through it, you enter an endless library where every book is written in your handwriting. They catalog your fears, your joys, the milder shades of hope you never acknowledged. You pause before one volume titled “Unspoken Goodbyes” and feel a soft hush of sorrow, gently balanced by a new tenderness toward your own past.  

From the library, a corridor of living vines unfurls, each tendril humming encouragement. You realize you can cradle both suffering and delight at once, that the heart is big enough to hold every contradiction. Guided by this truth, you emerge onto a hilltop where dawn bleeds across the sky in fiery petals. There, a mirror made of morning mist stands.  

You approach and see yourself—no longer the simple dreamer you were moments ago, but someone who has learned to recognize every hue of feeling. You smile in the mist, understanding at last that this dream’s true gift is the vast, nuanced landscape of your own heart. Then you awaken, carrying its quiet wisdom into the waking world.
