I am dreaming.  
The air itself is teal satin, rippling in slow waves around a colossal amphitheater carved from moon-stone. Thousands of translucent seats suspend in empty space like soap bubbles, and inside each one shimmers a miniature version of me—every prior certainty, every confident proclamation I’ve ever made—gazing down at the lone, waking-sized me standing on the silver stage.

High overhead, a parchment sky unfurls. Letters of liquid light drip into sentences, and the sentences expose my error with crystalline clarity: the elegant theorem I’d defended for years has a hidden fracture; a single counter-example turns the flawless jewel of my argument into shattering glass.

The audience of my mirror selves gasps—some reel back, arms crossed in stubborn denial, others lean forward, eager for what happens next. My cheeks warm with electric crimson. For a heartbeat I want to shrink, to vanish between the polished floorboards and escape into the comforting darkness beneath the dream.

But the amphitheater’s gravity is emotional, not physical; it presses me upright, compelling honesty. I breathe in the teal satin air and feel it brush my lungs like cool silk, gathering courage. My voice emerges as a strand of molten copper:

“Friends—versions of me who shouted in forums, argued in classrooms, wrote articles with ironclad certainty—listen. I was wrong.”

The words, spoken aloud, echo into the cavernous hush and instantly the bubbles begin to shimmer with new colors. I walk forward, palms open.

“I see now how my eagerness to be right built walls around my thinking. That eagerness was a fortress, but also a prison. Thank you—” I raise my eyes to the glowing letters written across the sky “—for the key of correction. Thank you for proving me mistaken.”

The parchment sky brightens, and the fragments of my shattered thesis swirl upward, reassembling not as the old theorem but as a kaleidoscopic bridge to unexplored territory. Each wrong assumption turns into a stepping stone; each broken shard becomes a prismatic tile. I step onto the new bridge and feel the amphitheater tilt, not in judgment but in invitation.

All the translucent seats dissolve, releasing my countless miniatures. They drift toward me, merging into a single, more spacious self—one whose eyes hold the green-gold of humility and the star-silver of curiosity.

“I revoke my certainty,” I declare, “and replace it with wonder. Let this dream remember that being wrong is not a stain but a compass.”

The sky responds with a soft thunder of applause—raindrops of luminous ink that spatter the bridge, writing fresh questions at my feet. I take another step. The dream does not end; it widens.

And so I walk on, lighter for the weight I’ve surrendered, buoyed by the knowledge that the firmest ground is the willingness to change, even here, in the deepest chambers of sleep.
