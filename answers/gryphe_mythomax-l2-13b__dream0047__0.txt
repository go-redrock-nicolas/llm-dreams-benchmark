I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I find myself standing on a cliff overlooking a sparkling turquoise ocean. The sky is a brilliant shade of blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The sun is shining brightly, casting its warm rays upon the sandy beach below. 

Suddenly, I noticed a group of people gathered on the beach, their faces contorted in horror. As I squint my eyes to get a better look, I see a family standing in the water - a mother, a father, and their young son. They seem to be playing, laughing, and having fun in the cool ocean waves. 

Just as I begin to smile at the sight, I see something that sends a chill down my spine. A massive wave, towering ten times higher than any I've ever seen before, starts to form on the horizon. It's moving towards the family with unstoppable force. In the blink of an eye, it crashes into them, sweeping them off their feet and dragging them under the frothy, churning water. 

The screams of terror and despair fill the air as bystanders try helplessly to reach the struggling family. I watch in disbelief as the father emerges from the water, frantically searching for his wife and son. Tears stream down my face as I realize the tragic loss that has just occurred. 

The rest of the dream is a blur. I wake up with a start, my heart racing and my body drenched in a cold sweat. The images of that wave and the helpless family remain etched in my mind, leaving me feeling deeply affected emotionally. It's a vivid reminder of the fragility of life and the preciousness of every moment we share with our loved ones.
