I am dreaming. You notice that your emotional reactions to certain situations seem disproportionate compared to others. Exploring these emotional sensitivities, you find yourself at a crossroads between two paths: one leading to happiness and fulfillment, the other to sadness and despair. Without knowing why exactly, you feel drawn towards the path of sorrow. Maybe because it feels more real or authentic somehow. 

As you walk down this path of sorrow, you see many familiar faces who seem trapped in their own misery: a friend who is struggling with addiction, another one who lost his job and family, yet another one who is battling cancer. They all look at you with sad eyes that plead for help or understanding but also seem resigned to their fate. 

Feeling helpless and hopeless yourself as well, you decide to keep walking until you find something that can change everything. You have no idea what that might be yet but trust that it will reveal itself eventually if only you keep moving forward. 

As you walk further down this path of sorrow, the surroundings become darker and gloomier: the sky turns black like a void where all hopes and dreams are lost forever; trees bend over as if carrying heavy burdens; ground cracks under your feet like broken hearts shattering into pieces. 

But then suddenly something catches your eye: a glimmer of light in the distance that seems brighter than any star or moon ever seen before. Curious and hopeful, you start running towards it without even thinking twice. 

As you approach this mysterious light source, it grows bigger and brighter until it engulfs you entirely and transforms into a beautiful rainbow that spans across the entire sky: red for passion and love; orange for creativity and joy; yellow for wisdom and friendship; green for harmony and growth; blue for trust and peace; indigo for vision and intuition; violet for freedom and spirituality. 

You realize then that this rainbow is your true path to happiness and fulfillment. It represents all the values, virtues, and skills you need to develop in order to overcome obstacles, challenges, and adversities along your journey towards self-actualization and authenticity. 

Feeling empowered by this revelation, you decide to follow this rainbow wherever it may lead you: up into the heavens where angels sing songs of praise or down into hell where demons dance with fire. You trust that no matter what happens next, you will find your way home eventually and maybe even help others do the same too.
