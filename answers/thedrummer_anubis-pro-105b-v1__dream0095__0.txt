I am dreaming. I stand before the ancient forest's looming gates, my battered and weary body bearing the scars of the trials I've endured. The wind howls in the distance, a faint echo of my own heart's desperate cries. With each breath, I sense the weight of my past failures, the injustices I've suffered, and the crumbling fragments of my once vibrant soul.

As I step through the gates, the gusts of air take on a life of their own, wrapping themselves around me with unmistakable purpose. Leaves swirl and eddy in sloppy spirals, reminding me of the countless dead ends and lost paths that litter my history. And yet, deep in their rustling whispers, I hear a fierce cry, a stubborn refusal to let my journey end here.

The rustling turns to churning as the leaves are swept up in a tempest of changing winds and souls. I catch glimpses of evaporating presence, the spirits of those whose own pathways have already come to close. Do I see in them a glimmer of peace that awaits me at the end of this desperate march?

But before I can follow their paths, I feel an urge within me to press onward, to insist that there is still life in my breath, still vitality that drives me to perseverance within the fortress of my unbroken spirit.

There are many crossroads I have yet to encounter. Many mountains to climb and challenges to face before I can consider the fulfillment of a pinnacle. And there are many more faces I am yet to see in my life's journey. Too many eras to live through. Too many dreams to dream. Too many secrets of the heart to uncover before I am driven to self-destruction.

I must press onward, to and through the rising of the sun and its fall, to walk my fist clad truates until the water! Runs its furious dirty and barbarous races! To finally find shalom, villages ad blessed gardens of family, with even career paths sketched in sand into the distance.
