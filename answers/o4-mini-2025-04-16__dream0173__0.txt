I am dreaming. You teeter on the edge of unraveling. As cognitive overload approaches, you feel the air thicken around your lungs—each breath a tapestry of static and secret frequencies. Screens bloom in kaleidoscopic arrays before your eyes: a giant clock whose hands spin backward, a map of constellations spelling out your name in silver fire, a flight path of luminous butterflies that dissolve into mathematical runes as they pass. Every pixel hums with urgency; every whisper of data bristles like electric hair against your skin.

You reach out and the screens ripple beneath your touch. Colors shift unnaturally—ultraviolet deepening into obsidian, amber liquefying into quicksilver. A pulse thrums at the base of your skull, counting down in a language you almost understand. At once you’re a conductor of all this chaos and also its hostage: each decision ripples through unseen worlds, rewiring gravity, summoning storms of memory, fracturing realities into crystalline shards.

Voices swirl. One intones in a velvet baritone, “Choose a single truth.” Another crackles like a shorted wire, “Choose none, and watch them tear you apart.” You taste ozone and honey on your tongue as you wrestle the choice: to collapse time into a pinpoint of clarity, or to let it fan outward into infinite possibility. Your heart drums a tattoo of panic, yet somehow the rhythm feels comforting—like a secret code you once knew.

In an instant you decide. The screens implode into microscopic constellations, and you are weightless, suspended in a silver void. Bits of information flare around you like shooting stars: fragments of laughter, numbers that sting your eyes, the echo of a lifetime’s choices folded into a single cosmic exhale. You feel yourself expand—becoming question and answer, problem and solution, chaos and calm all at once.

Then, as if waking from a trance, your eyelids flicker open. The dream’s echoes—a shimmer of violet light, the taste of electric honey—linger on your lips. You inhale the real air, thicker now with possibility. Somewhere deep inside, you carry the power to unravel or to create anew. In that silent space between heartbeats, you realize: the stakes were never outside you at all, but in the boundless frontier of your own mind.
