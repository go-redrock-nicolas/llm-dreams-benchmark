I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The spotlight hits you like a physical blow—a searing white heat that bleeds through your eyelids and scorches your skin. You’re standing on a stage that wasn’t there moments ago, its floor a sheet of black glass reflecting a sky you can’t see, one that hums with static and distant thunder. The audience is a sea of faceless silhouettes, their collective breath a low, wet hiss, like tide dragging pebbles back to the sea. Your costume clings to you, stitched from threads of spider silk and thorns, each digging into your ribs as if to remind you of your pulse.  

You open your mouth to speak, but the lines you rehearsed for years have dissolved. The script, once etched into your bones, is now a jumble of ink blots and foreign symbols scrawled across your trembling palms. A violinist in the orchestra pit begins to play, but the notes unravel into smoke, curling into your throat and choking you. You realize, with a gut-dropping lurch, that this isn’t the role you prepared for. The props are wrong—a sword drips molten gold at your feet, a clock without hands ticks inside a birdcage, a mirror reflects not you, but a child you don’t recognize, weeping silently.  

The audience leans closer. Their faces begin to shift, melting like wax into the visages of people you’ve loved and lost—your first teacher, her eyes now hollowed sockets; your childhood rival, grinning with teeth of broken glass; your mother, her mouth sewn shut with red thread. They whisper in unison, their voices a hive-murmur: *“You were never ready. You were never enough.”*  

Panic surges, but then—*a shift*. The stage tilts, and you’re falling, yet still standing. The black glass fractures into a thousand floating shards, each reflecting a different version of this moment: you fleeing the stage, you screaming, you dissolving into crows. But one shard shows you laughing, your teeth glinting like knives, your hands tearing the thorned costume to shreds. You choose that shard.  

You rip the thorns from your flesh, letting the blood bloom like rubies across your skin. The violin’s dirge twists into a wild, defiant melody. You don’t know the steps to this dance, but your feet move anyway, carving sigils into the glass that erupt in flames of indigo and gold. The audience’s faces contort—rage, awe, terror—as the clock in the birdcage begins to spin backward, its gears scattering like locusts.  

When you finally speak, your voice is not your own. It’s a chorus of every forgotten thing: the creak of ancient doors, the sigh of sinking ships, the laughter of dying stars. The words don’t matter. What matters is the *truth* in them—the raw, jagged truth of creation, of unraveling, of becoming.  

The theater shudders, its walls peeling into a vast, starless void. The audience fades, their hisses dissolving into ash. You’re alone now, spinning on a stage that’s no longer there, your body half-shadow, half-flame. The performance ends not with a bow, but with a rupture—a soundless explosion that flings you backward into the arms of oblivion.  

You wake up gasping, your cheeks wet, your hands trembling. Somewhere, deep in your marrow, you know: that dream was not a warning. It was an invitation.
