I am dreaming. I stand in the gleaming glass atrium of a corporate tower, sunlight fracturing through the ceiling into countless rainbows that dance across marble floors. The project folder in my hands feels unnaturally heavy, its contents somehow vital to everything I've worked for. Faces I've come to know—colleagues, friends—approach me one by one, each removing their company badges and placing them wordlessly in my outstretched palm before walking backward into elevators that seem to swallow them whole.

The badges pile up, warm and vibrating slightly, as if still containing the essence of those who've abandoned the cause. The weight of responsibility grows with each departure, yet the massive digital countdown clock on the wall continues its relentless march toward zero. Each red digit flips with a sound like distant thunder.

My remaining team members look to me with eyes that shift between hope and doubt, their features occasionally blurring like watercolors in rain. The project plans spread across the conference table begin moving, diagrams rearranging themselves into impossible patterns that somehow make perfect sense to me alone.

Outside the windows, the sky darkens prematurely, clouds spiraling inward above our building as if we've become the center of some cosmic drain. My phone rings with calls from executives whose voices sound like they're speaking underwater, demanding explanations I don't have with words that occasionally transform into musical notes.

As I walk the empty cubicles of departed colleagues, their personal items transform into birds that flutter briefly before dissolving into motes of light. I find myself picking up their unfinished work, each page absorbing into my fingertips, the knowledge flowing directly into my consciousness in streams of colored light.

Time begins to behave strangely—minutes stretching elastically while hours compress into seconds. In the bathroom mirror, my reflection continues working when I pause, offering silent solutions through elaborate hand gestures. The deadline approaches with physical presence, a pressure that makes the air thick and difficult to breathe.

Yet somewhere within this impossible situation, my dream-self discovers unexpected resources—talents I never knew I possessed, connections to knowledge I couldn't possibly have. The remaining team members begin to glow faintly, their capabilities expanding as we work in a harmony that transcends ordinary collaboration.

The project transforms from burden to vessel, carrying us all toward something greater than its original purpose, something beautiful and necessary that could only be discovered through this crucible of impossibility.
