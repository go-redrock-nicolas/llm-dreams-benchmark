I am dreaming. I find myself transported to a medieval-like world, with rolling hills and dense forests surrounding me. The air is thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. As I look around, I see no signs of modern technology – no cars, no phones, no electric lights. 

Instead, I spot torches flickering in the distance and hear the distant echo of horses' hooves against stone. I feel a sense of awe and wonder wash over me as I immerse myself in this mysterious new world.

Slowly, I begin to make my way towards the source of the light and the sound. After some time, I come upon a small village nestled among the hills. The houses are built of wood and stone, with thatched roofs and small windows. 

As I approach, I see villagers going about their daily routines – tending to animals, cooking over open fires, and mending clothing. They all seem to be hardworking and content, living simple lives in harmony with nature.

I wander through the village, feeling curious and a bit disoriented. Eventually, an elderly woman spots me and approaches cautiously. She asks my name and tells me hers was Agnes. She invites me into her home, where her family is gathering for the evening meal. 

In her home, there is a warmth and coziness that I had never experienced before. The walls are adorned with tapestries depicting mythical creatures and heroic battles. There is a fire crackling in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the walls.

The family welcomes me with open arms, offering me food and drink. We share stories and laughter as we all sit around the table. For the first time in this dream, I feel truly at peace and accepted. 

As the night wears on, I find myself drifting off to sleep on a rug before the fire, lulled by the sound of the family's gentle snores. I realize that in this dream, I am not simply observing, but truly experiencing life in another era. And although I know I will wake up in my own time, I find myself not wanting to leave this magical, captivating place.
