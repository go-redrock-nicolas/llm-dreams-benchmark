I am dreaming. …drift forward on a hush of violet wind, and the very air seems to shimmer with unspoken questions.

A moment ago—though in dreams “moments” are slippery things—the landscape felt brittle and gray, as though judgment had coated everything in a thin crust of frost. But the instant you choose curiosity, color floods back into the world. The ground beneath your bare feet turns to rippling opal sand; each grain flashes a secret spectrum when it catches starlight. Mountains rise and fall like the slow breathing of some enormous sleeper, their slopes veined with rivers of liquid moonlight.

You wander, open-eyed, and the first wonder arrives: a forest made entirely of translucent library cards. They’re stacked into living trees, their leaves stamped with due dates from forgotten centuries. You brush one gently. Instead of crinkling or tearing, it hums—a low, resonant tone—and the whole grove answers in harmony. Judgment might have dismissed this place as strange, impossible, even pointless. Curiosity coaxes music from it.

Up ahead, a caravan of sapient umbrellas trundles past on cricket-leg spokes. Their canopies swirl with moving murals—stormy seascapes, children’s chalk doodles, mathematical constellations—and each umbrella tips its brim politely as it rolls by. One pauses to offer you a ride. Grinning, you hop onto its fabric, and it springs skyward like a jubilant kite. The earth falls away, replaced by a tapestry of floating islands linked by silver suspension bridges.

You land on an isle carpeted with pages torn from unwritten novels. The words rearrange themselves as you step, sentences blossoming underfoot: “She tasted sunrise on the tip of her tongue” … “They folded grief into origami swans.” Every phrase invites you deeper. There is no critique here, no red pen hovering—only invitation. When you kneel to read, the letters rise in flickering clouds and coalesce into a doorway of molten ink.

On the far side of the doorway lies a mirror lake. Its surface is so glassy that stars appear sharper in its reflection than in the heavens themselves. You kneel and gaze down. Instead of your own face, you see a kaleidoscope of every version of you that ever wondered “what if?”—the astronaut, the painter, the beekeeper, the quiet librarian, the traveler who never returned home. They smile back, not as accusations but as possibilities. Judgment would rank them: better, worse, success, failure. Curiosity simply greets them: “Hello. Tell me your story.”

A soft ripple spreads across the water, and the astronaut-you climbs out, suit adorned with phosphorescent barnacles. “There’s a nebula that smells faintly of cinnamon,” she says, offering a fistful of stardust. The painter-you follows, his coat spattered in sunset colors. “I found a shade of blue that makes people remember their oldest lullaby.” One by one, all your dream-selves emerge, circling you like glowing fireflies in human form, sharing their discoveries. With each revelation, you feel an internal click, like the unlocking of nested glass boxes.

Suddenly a hush descends. The dream-selves part to reveal a colossal hourglass floating above the lake, its sand frozen in mid-pour. Judgment would fret about time—too little, too late, missed chances. Curiosity prompts you closer. You reach out, touch the hourglass, and the sand ignites into constellations that whirl around your hand. They do not count down; they spin outward, mapping a universe of next questions.

A final hush. The umbrellas, the library-card trees, the sentence-isle, your mirrored selves—they all gaze at you, waiting. You inhale. Somewhere in the waking world, your physical chest rises and falls. But here, in this lucent moment, you realize that every time you choose to meet the unknown with wonder, you trade the heavy armor of judgment for wings made of possibility.

The dream’s horizon brightens, not with dawn but with potential. You step forward, wings unfurling from pure curiosity, and the world—now pliant, gleaming, eager—reshapes itself to your next question.
