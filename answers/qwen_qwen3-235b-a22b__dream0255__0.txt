I am dreaming. The dream begins in a place that feels like the edge of the world—a vast, twilight meadow where the grass glows faintly silver, as if moonlight has been woven into its blades. Above, the sky is a tapestry of shifting colors: indigo melting into bruised plum, then bleeding into the soft gold of a half-remembered sunrise. The air hums with the sound of distant chimes, though there are no bells in sight. You know this place, though you’ve never been here before. It’s the kind of dream that feels like memory, like prophecy, like a secret whispered between heartbeats.  

You’re not alone.  

Your sister—*Lena*, though she hasn’t said her name yet—is here. She’s sitting cross-legged on a floating island of moss that hovers just above the meadow, her legs dangling over the edge. She’s laughing, the sound bright and musical, as she plucks petals from a flower that reforms itself each time she tears it apart. Her hair is the same shade of chestnut as always, but in this dream, it shimmers with streaks of starlight. She’s radiant. She’s lying.  

You can see it in the way her eyes flicker—not to you, but to the horizon, where shadows coil like smoke beneath the horizon. Her laughter doesn’t reach them. They’re the color of storm clouds, and they’re drowning.  

You approach slowly, careful not to startle her. The moss island dips as you sit beside her, and for a moment, the air between you is heavy with the weight of what isn’t being said. She hums a lullaby you both knew as children, the melody frayed at the edges. You remember the nights she sang it to you after your parents’ arguments, her voice steady even when her hands shook. She’s always been good at stitching herself together in plain sight.  

You don’t ask her what’s wrong. Instead, you reach into the air and pull out a thread of light—a filament of the meadow’s glow—and begin weaving it into a shape. A bird, wings trembling. It flutters to life in your hands and soars toward the horizon, its flight path tracing the outline of a tear. Lena’s breath catches. The flower in her hand wilts, then blooms again, this time with petals of ash-gray.  

“I saw you,” you say softly, not looking at her. “Last week. Outside the grocery store. You smiled when you saw me, but your hands were clenched so tight your knuckles turned white.”  

She freezes, the moss beneath her darkening to a bruised violet. The chimes above falter, then resume, quieter now.  

“I know you’re not okay,” you continue, “but I’m not here to pry. I’m just… here.”  

For a moment, nothing. Then the shadows beneath the horizon rise—a tide of ink-black water, swallowing the meadow’s silver grass. Lena’s island trembles, but you don’t move. The water laps at your ankles, cold and sharp, and you let it. It’s not your pain to fix, but it’s your love to hold.  

When she finally speaks, her voice is the sound of the flower petals falling. “I feel like I’m… unraveling. Like I’m too big for my skin, but too small to matter.”  

The dream shifts. The water recedes. The sky brightens to a tentative rose-gold. Lena’s eyes meet yours, and for the first time, they’re not storm clouds—they’re oceans, vast and aching and real. You hand her the bird you wove from light. It perches on her palm, singing a note so pure it makes the chimes weep.  

“You don’t have to be cheerful for me,” you say. “I’ll stay even if you’re not.”  

She doesn’t cry. But the bird takes flight, and where it goes, the shadows retreat. The meadow grows a little brighter.  

When you wake, your cheeks are wet. Somewhere, in the waking world, Lena is sleeping—and for the first time in weeks, she exhales without holding her breath.
