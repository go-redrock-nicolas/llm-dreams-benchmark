I am dreaming. I find myself adrift in a realm where reality's rules have dissolved completely. The sky above me shifts from deep indigo to molten gold in rhythmic waves, while crystalline clouds sculpt themselves into impossible geometries before shattering into prisms of light. The ground beneath my feet feels both solid and liquid simultaneously—sometimes moss-soft and yielding, other moments glassy and resonant with each footfall.

As I wander through this ever-transforming panorama, trees grow upward then sideways, their bark rippling with iridescent patterns that seem to communicate in a visual language just beyond my comprehension. Flowers bloom and die in seconds, releasing scents that trigger memories I've never actually lived—the salt-spray of an alien ocean, the spice-sweetness of a fruit that doesn't exist.

I crest a hill where gravity feels optional, and there before me sits a canvas, pristine white and hovering inches above a meadow of undulating grass that changes color with each breath I take. The canvas calls to me with an inexplicable urgency, its blankness somehow more potent than any masterpiece.

When my fingertips touch its surface, the canvas doesn't feel like fabric or paper but like something alive—warm and slightly pulsing. Colors begin flowing from my fingertips unbidden—colors I've never seen in waking life, hues that exist between the known spectrum. They spread and dance across the canvas, forming landscapes and faces and abstract patterns that seem to hold profound truths just beyond articulation.

I realize, with dream-logic certainty, that I'm not painting the canvas—I'm unlocking something that was always there, revealing layers of reality normally hidden from perception. Each stroke connects me deeper to this dreamworld, as if I'm simultaneously creating and discovering it.

The canvas begins to expand, its edges stretching outward until it surrounds me completely, and I understand that the dream itself is my creation, and I am its creation too—artist and artwork inseparably entwined in an infinite loop of imagination.
