I am dreaming. The lights flicker once, twice, then plunge the subway into darkness. Passengers' muffled gasps and panicked whispers fill the air. In the sudden blackness, you struggle to understand what's happening. Someone beside you stumbles, their elbow jostling against your arm as they try to regain balance. 

A hand reaches out and grabs your shoulder, catching you off guard. You whirl around, but there's no one there, just more grasping shadows and the screaming silence. Angeles beyond the halted cars. The sound of terrified screams pierce your eardrums, even through the makeshift protection of your palms. In the background, an eerie green glow begins to emanate from somewhere out there in tunnel. The metal walls of the subway train entre stretch out above you. A rescue worker tells you there is a gas leak.
