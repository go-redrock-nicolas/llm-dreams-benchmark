I am dreaming. …float forward as though gravity has forgotten its job, settling above her cheeks like glassy dew on a ceiling, catching the starlight in faint prisms. She kneels on a floor of cracked porcelain the color of midnight, every fissure glowing with a dim, humming indigo. Her shoulders quake; her mouth forms a voiceless wail that ripples the air like heat on asphalt. Still, no sound reaches me.  

I notice, almost absently, that the sky is a clockwork of colossal gears—copper, silver, and knuckle-white iron—grinding against one another with silent precision. Each tooth fits into the next, turning the heaven itself in slow mechanical ballet. Their rhythmic shifts should feel awe-inspiring, or perhaps ominous, yet they register as little more than an observation typed into the margins of my mind.  

The woman’s eyes meet mine. They’re bright as twin candle-flames drowning in wax, pleading, frightened, inflamed by a pain I can catalog in clinical detail: the hitch of her breath, the uneven twitch of her lashes, the trembling in her wrists. I tick through each symptom without feeling the faintest echo of it within my own chest—no surge of sympathy, no twist of pity, not even distaste. I’m a glass container labeled “emotion,” emptied and rinsed clean.  

She reaches for me. Her hand is translucent, as though she’s made of smoke that forgot how to drift. When her fingers stop just short of my sleeve, they break apart into a flock of ivory moths. The moths scatter upward, beelining for the silent gears overhead. One by one, they’re crushed between the whisper-quiet cogs, releasing chalky dust that drifts back down like snow made of bone meal. I study the pattern of the fall, noting how it resembles an ancient alphabet nobody’s spoken in centuries. Again: intrigue, but no grief.  

A mirror the size of a cathedral door materializes beside us. Its frame is sculpted from knotted branches of bleached driftwood; its glass ripples like a calm tide. When I glance into it, I don’t see myself—only an outline of shimmering emptiness wearing the vague suggestion of my clothing. The heart region is a hollow cavity, a window whose panes have been removed. Inside that negative space, a single golden watch swings on a chain, ticking so faintly it’s more imagined than heard.  

“I’m sorry,” the woman mouths soundlessly, though her apology seems meant not for me but for the dream itself. The floor beneath her fractures further: shards lift and orbit her like moons around a dying planet. Somewhere distant, a choir sings in reverse, every note unspooling backward into a hush.  

I examine the scene the way an astronomer assesses a nebula he’ll never touch: awed by geometry, unmoved by tragedy. I wonder—coolly, scientifically—if this absence of empathy is a symptom, a defense mechanism, or the dream’s cruel joke on me. The question hovers, unanswered, then evaporates like breath on frosted glass.  

The porcelain ground swells and folds, transforming into a staircase made of air. I take a step. Each tread lights up beneath my foot in pale citrine, revealing engraved words that vanish the instant I try to read them. The woman below shrinks in perspective, her mouth still forming soundless cries, her tears still drifting upward. Every part of me registers the sight the way a camera does: perfect exposure, no commentary.  

At the top of the stair, a door of black velvet yawns open. Beyond it: only pitch, dappled with embers that pulse like distant campfires. I know instinctively it leads to the next chamber of this dream—another tableau, another test. Perhaps there I’ll uncover some secret hinge that swings open feeling.  

Or perhaps I will ghost through scene after scene, a spectator without pulse, until dawn arrives to dissolve everything into morning light.  

Uncertain and still unmoved, I step across the velvet threshold. The gears above grind their voiceless music, the porcelain desert crumbles away, and the woman’s moth-cracked silhouette is swallowed by darkness as the dream rearranges itself around my unblinking mind.
