I am dreaming. You are standing in a vast ancient library, the air heavy with the scent of old parchments and the faint whisper of forgotten knowledge. Shelves stretch endlessly in every direction, filled with books bound in leather so weathered that the gold embossing has faded into ghostly shadows. The ambient light comes from an ethereal glow emanating from a grand, domed ceiling, where celestial constellations ripple like liquid stars, as if the room is alive.

Your attention is drawn to an alcove, where a pedestal rises, crowned by an intricately carved stone tablet. The surface is etched with cryptic symbols, its edges worn and smoothed by untold years. The symbols seem to shimmer occasionally, as if reacting to the energy of your presence. There is a persistent hum in the air, a low hum that is neither sound nor vibration but something deeper, more primal. It resonates in your bones, urging you to understand.

You reach out, your fingers hovering over the tablet. The symbols begin to shift and rearrange themselves, the lines forming more images and patterns. A faint map begins to emerge, revealing an intricate network of paths leading to unknown locations. As you reach out to touch one of the symbols, it pulses with light, and a soft, musical note echoes through the chamber.

Suddenly, the room begins to change. The bookshelves morph into towering, twisting trees, and the starry dome transforms into an infinite canopy of leaves that cast moving shadows. The air is now filled with the sound of distant, ethereal bird calls. You feel a gentle breeze, and the world beneath your feet becomes a vibrant green field.

I am dreaming.
