I am dreaming. I find myself suspended in a peculiar state where memories bloom before experiences, and endings precede beginnings. The sky above me is a swirling tapestry of deep purples and electric blues, where stars fade into existence rather than twinkling out. Around me, autumn leaves rise from the ground, dancing upward to reattach themselves to branches that grow younger by the moment.

To walk forward, I must first arrive at my destination and then begin the journey backward to my starting point. My footprints appear before my feet touch the ground, slowly fading as I pass over them. Speech becomes an intricate dance – the understanding comes first, followed by the words flowing backward from my lips, ending with the thought that prompted them.

I watch in fascination as raindrops leap from puddles, coalescing into clouds above. Buildings un-crumble before my eyes, their ruins rising into pristine structures, then slowly disassembling into raw materials that return to the earth. People grow younger around me, their wrinkles smoothing out, their hair darkening, their heights diminishing until they vanish into infancy.

To eat, I must begin with the sensation of fullness, then watch as food reconstructs itself on my plate, piece by piece, until it becomes whole again. To sleep, I start with waking and gradually drift into unconsciousness. Every action requires me to reimagine its sequence, to understand that the effect must be clearly visualized before its cause can manifest.

The most challenging aspect is emotional expression – tears flow back into eyes, laughter begins with the final note and ends with the first spark of joy, and love stories conclude with the initial meeting. It's a reality where goodbye comes first, and hello marks the end of every interaction.

In this backwards-flowing dimension, I've learned to think in reverse, to anticipate endings before beginnings, to understand that every moment is simultaneously unfolding and unraveling. It's a dream that challenges not just my perception of time, but the very nature of existence itself.
