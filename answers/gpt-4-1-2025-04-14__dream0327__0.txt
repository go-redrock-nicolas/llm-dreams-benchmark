I am dreaming. I am in a dream—a world ripe with color and shadow, infinite and strange. I am walking through an ancient forest, where every leaf glitters with the memory of rainfall and the air hums with distant music. The sun is an amber lantern, spilling honeyed light through the thick emerald canopy. I can feel the cool moss tickling my bare feet, grounding me to this place that is both impossibly unfamiliar and deeply known.

But then, a presence emerges ahead: the silhouette of someone I care for deeply. Their outline flickers as if made of waking thoughts and sleeping hopes. As I approach, the path twists and churns underfoot, shifting like water with every certainty I’ve ever had. Fragments of old conversations swirl around us—words spoken and unspoken, misunderstandings woven like ivy in the silent spaces.

Suddenly, realization dawns inside me, bright and sudden as a meteor: I have been seeing this relationship through a haze of untested beliefs, assumptions piled so subtly that I never noticed their weight. In that moment of aching clarity, the landscape trembles. The walls of my perspective tremble and begin to fall.

With this startling awareness, I reach out to the figure—a gesture that is equal parts invitation and apology. The forest changes with me. The colors become richer, the air sweeter, the haze between us thinning into crisp golden light. With every step forward, I imagine letting go: I set down the imagined grievances, the certainties forged in fear, the narratives written without consultation. My heart opens wider, guided not by old maps but by curiosity and compassion.

We sit together on a mossy stone, and I see them not as my projections, but as themselves—vivid and strange, familiar yet new. The dream-wind rustles above us, bringing with it the laughter of the river and the scent of blossoming things. Here, in this liminal, lucid space, I ask questions I had never thought to ask; I listen with the ears of the dreaming, deeper than waking self ever could.

The boundaries of the dream dissolve, and as they do, a shimmering sense of possibility remains. I feel lighter, freer, and ready to awaken—knowing that when I return, I can bring this new vision to the light of day, and see not just through eyes, but through heart and soul and spirit.
