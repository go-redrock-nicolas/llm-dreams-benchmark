I am dreaming.

I find myself stepping barefoot onto the cool, powdery sand of a Japanese shoreline under a moon tinged with silver and smoky blue. Far from my familiar world, I wander silently to the edge of a lantern-lit festival beside the gently lapping sea. Paper lanterns float, bobbing on the water’s surface, trailing flickers of gold that shimmer in the breeze like a thousand fleeting wishes. Their light dances on the faces of strangers who somehow feel like old friends.

Drawn by a haunting melody, I wind through the festival, entranced by a swirl of color—silk kimono sleeves fluttering with every graceful movement. I am invited, wordlessly, to join. Soft hands guide me and laughter glides warm along the night air. I mimic the slow, stylized steps of a Bon Odori dancer, my body awkward at first, but gradually yielding—opening—to the dazzling, ancient rhythm.

As I move, the beat of the drums pulses within my chest, and I am no longer an outsider. My feet remember steps I’ve never learned. Each gesture—turning, clapping, circling with others—is an offering. We honor souls unseen, stories untold. The world expands and my senses heighten: the woody incense curling from shrines, the salty tang of yakitori on smoky charcoal, the staccato pop-pop of distant fireworks igniting against the sky’s velvet.

Somewhere near, a grandmother’s gentle voice hums an old folk song. Her words, though unknown to me, resonate—a thread sewing through generations. I kneel amid a ring of small children, joining them in folding tiny origami boats from rice paper, each inscribed with hopes and memories. We launch them into the water, watching as their sails catch the wind and drift into the vast, illuminated dark.

I awaken with traces of the festival clinging to me: the scent of summer seaweed, the echo of drums thrumming in my heart, the unexplainable sense that I am both changed and home. The dream lingers, a bridge built overnight between worlds—my spirit humming with the rhythm of another place, another life, forever a part of me.
