I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself standing in a large, dark space. There are no walls, no ceiling, just an endless blackness all around. Suddenly, a glowing light appears in front of me. As I approach it, the light grows larger, until it's a massive, red portal. I reach out and touch the portal, and it feels warm and inviting.

I step through the portal, and I find myself in a beautiful, green forest. The sky is the perfect blue, with just a few fluffy white clouds. There's a gentle breeze, and I can hear birds singing in the distance. I walk further into the forest, and I see a path ahead of me.

As I follow the path, I come across a clearing. In the center of the clearing is a large, old tree, its branches reaching toward the sky. I walk closer to the tree, and I see that there's a door carved into its trunk. I reach out and open the door, and I see a set of wooden stairs leading down into darkness.

I take a breath and start down the stairs. The air grows cold and damp as I descend, and I can hear the sound of rushing water. At the bottom of the stairs, I find myself in a large, underground cavern. There's a river running through the center of the cavern, and I can see glowing, blue crystals embedded in the walls.

I follow the river, and as I walk, I start to feel a strange, tingling sensation. The crystals in the walls seem to be glowing brighter, and I can feel a powerful energy building inside of me. Suddenly, I'm enveloped in light, and I feel myself being lifted up and out of the cavern.

I open my eyes, and I'm back in the forest, standing in front of the tree with the door in its trunk. But something is different. The tree looks healthier, the path ahead of me looks clearer, and I can feel a newfound strength and courage inside of me. I realize that during this dream, I faced my fear and grew as a person. I challenged my comfort-seeking tendencies and pushed myself forward, even when it was uncomfortable.

As I wake up from the dream, I look around my room. The light from the window is streaming in, illuminating the shadows. I feel a sense of peace and contentment wash over me. The vivid images from my dream still linger, reminding me that even in the darkest depths of my mind, there is hidden potential and growth waiting to be discovered.

The message of this dream stays with me, echoing in my mind as I go about my day. I understand that challenges and uncomfortable situations are a part of growth, and that facing them head-on is the only way to truly progress. My hand reaches for the small, intricately carved wooden pendant resting on my nightstand, a keepsake from my grandfather. The familiar, smooth wood against my fingertips serves as a physical reminder of the wisdom he shared with me years ago: that stepping out of your comfort zone is often the first step towards realizing your true potential.

My imagination, fueled by the deep slumber and the questions of the night, responded by crafting a dream that would analyze my own selfaciente nature and watch myself grow over the course of an evolving, surreal journey. All people have within them a similar capacity for self reflection, and my immagination was momentarily dwelling in the part of the subconscious that carries out our deepest ego, in order to test the vast unknown depths of the mind.

Imagination has gone and most tickets are sold out.
