I am dreaming. You are drifting through a sky made of humming starlight, each breath a slow ripple on the surface of some vast, liquid cosmos.  Below you, the world folds and unfolds like origami—mountain ridges curling into golden feathers, rivers of molten opal flowing backward toward unseen springs.  The air thrums with a low, pulsing hum that seems to speak in half-remembered syllables.  

And then—suddenly—the hum stops.  The entire dreamscape holds its breath.  You realize that, all along, there has been a shadow inside you, a trembling weight you have never let yourself feel.  It flickers now at your core, neither wholly dark nor light, but a roiling mix of cobalt and rust.  It is the emotion you have quietly denied: unspoken grief that tastes of salt and ash.  

Creating space to experience this disowned feeling, you sink onto a smooth, mirror-polished stone that floats on a slow current of pale mist.  As you settle, the cobalt-rust glow within you unfurls like a flower in reverse—petals curling back into a bud.  You lean forward and place your hands on the mirror-stone’s surface.  It is cool, reassuring, and when you look down, your reflection does not shy away.  In its eyes, you see the corners of a mouth trembling, a single tear of molten glass welling up.  

You let it fall.  The crystal bead shatters on the stone, and from its breakburst a cascade of whispered memories: half-heard lullabies, laughter choked by rain, the way your chest felt too tight to breathe after someone dear slipped away.  You lean into each fragment, feeling the hollow ache as it expands into your limbs—aches that once felt forbidden now bloom with aching clarity.  

All around you, the landscape responds.  The mountains straighten their origami folds; the rivers reverse again, flowing out from the sky.  Thousands of tiny lights—like fireflies made of longing—drift down, settling on your shoulders, your hair.  They pulse gently, as if saying: “We have waited. We are here now.”  

In that wavering moment, you realize that grief is not a trap but a kind of hidden door.  And when you allow yourself to open it, you find beyond an entire hidden realm: raw and tender, alive with possibility.  You breathe deeply, and for the first time, you feel the full tide of what you’ve carried in silence—and in feeling it fully, you become more whole than you ever dreamed you could be.
