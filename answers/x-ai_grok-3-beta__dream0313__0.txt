I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, surreal landscape, a world born from the deepest wells of imagination—a place where reality bends and shimmers like heat rising from desert sand. The sky above is not blue, nor even a recognizable shade, but a swirling canvas of molten gold and violet, as if the aurora borealis has bled into a sunset and decided to stay. Clouds drift like translucent jellyfish, pulsating with soft, bioluminescent light, casting an otherworldly glow over the ground below. The terrain is a patchwork of the impossible: fields of glass grass that chime like tiny bells when the wind brushes over them, rivers of liquid silver that flow upward into the sky before cascading back down in glittering loops, and colossal trees with bark made of obsidian, their leaves shimmering like stained glass in a cathedral of dreams.

I take a step forward, and the ground beneath my feet ripples like water, sending out waves of color—emerald, sapphire, ruby—that dissolve into the air with a faint hum. My breath catches as I realize I’m not alone. Ahead, there’s a figure, cloaked in mist and shadow, standing at the base of one of those obsidian trees. Their presence feels heavy, like a memory I can’t quite grasp, a weight that presses against my chest. I approach, my heart pounding with a mix of curiosity and dread, knowing somehow that this encounter will unravel something raw within me.

As I draw closer, the figure turns, and though their face remains obscured by the swirling mist, I feel their gaze pierce through me, peeling back layers of my soul I’ve kept buried. “Speak,” they say, their voice a haunting melody that echoes like wind through a cavern. “Why do you hide your pain behind laughter?”

I open my mouth to respond, but the words that come out are not what I intend. A nervous chuckle spills from my lips, and I blurt, “Oh, you know, life’s just a cosmic stand-up routine—gotta laugh or I’ll cry, right? Gotta keep the audience entertained!” My hands gesture wildly, as if I’m on stage, and I can feel the grin plastered on my face, wide and false, a mask I’ve worn too long. Inside, though, there’s a tightening, a pang of shame and ache, as if the glass grass beneath me has shattered and pierced straight through my heart.

The figure doesn’t react to my jest. Instead, they extend a hand, and from their palm blooms a sphere of light, flickering with scenes from my past—moments of loss, of unspoken grief, of nights spent staring at a ceiling while my mind replayed every hurt I’ve buried. My inappropriate humor, my deflections, they’re all there, playing out like a silent film, and I can’t look away. My throat tightens, and I want to crack another joke, to say something like, “Hey, at least I’m the comic relief in my own tragedy!” But the words stick, and for the first time, I feel the weight of my own defense mechanism, the way I’ve used humor as a shield, a way to dodge the sharp edges of my own emotions.

“You laugh to keep the darkness at bay,” the figure murmurs, their voice now softer, like a lullaby woven with sorrow. “But the darkness is not your enemy. It is part of you. Let it be felt.”

I want to protest, to throw out another quip, but the sphere of light pulses, and suddenly I’m no longer standing by the tree. I’m submerged in the liquid silver river, floating weightless, the cool metallic current wrapping around me like a cocoon. The memories flood in—not as images now, but as sensations. The ache of goodbye, the sting of failure, the hollow quiet of loneliness—they wash over me, heavy and unrelenting, and for once, I don’t try to laugh them away. Tears mix with the silver stream, unseen but felt, and I let myself grieve in this strange, beautiful place where no one can judge me, not even myself.

The figure reappears, hovering above the river’s surface, their form now clearer—a reflection of myself, but softer, kinder, as if they are the version of me that has learned to heal. “Pain is not a flaw,” they say. “It is a teacher. And you are more than your laughter.”

As their words seep into me, the river begins to glow, brighter and warmer, until it feels like I’m cradled in sunlight. The landscape shifts again—the glass grass melts into rolling meadows of velvet green, the obsidian trees bloom with flowers of flame that don’t burn but flicker comforting warmth, and the sky steadies into a deep, endless indigo, dotted with stars that hum a gentle tune. I feel lighter, as if I’ve shed a layer of armor I didn’t even know I was wearing.

I wake from this dream—not with a start, but gently, as if floating to the surface of consciousness—with a lingering sense of clarity. The humor I’ve wielded as a shield still lingers in my mind, but now I see it for what it is: a habit, not a necessity. And beneath it, there’s a quiet strength, a willingness to feel the pain without fear, to let it exist alongside the laughter, knowing that both are part of who I am. The dream’s vibrant, impossible world fades, but its lesson remains, etched into my waking thoughts like the chime of glass grass in a forgotten wind.
