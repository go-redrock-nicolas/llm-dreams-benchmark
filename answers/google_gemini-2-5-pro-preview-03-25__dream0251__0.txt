I am dreaming. My anxiety starts as a low hum, a barely audible vibration in the pit of my stomach. It’s like the distant thrum of bass from a party down the street, ignorable at first, but steadily growing louder. The presentation slides, meticulously crafted over sleepless nights, flicker behind my eyelids. Each bullet point seems to sharpen into a tiny, accusatory shard aimed directly at my competence.

The room I’m in begins to subtly shift. The walls, initially solid and reassuringly beige, start to breathe. Not dramatically, just a slow, almost imperceptible pulse that makes the corners seem to blur and warp. The air thickens, growing heavy and sweet, like overripe fruit left too long in the sun. It clings to my skin, a sticky film of anticipation.

My intrusive thoughts arrive not as whispers, but as booming pronouncements from an unseen judge. *“You’re not ready.”* The words echo, bouncing off the undulating walls, multiplying until they become a deafening chorus. *“They’ll see right through you.”* Each syllable lands like a physical blow, tightening the knot in my chest. *“Failure is inevitable.”* This one hangs in the syrupy air, shimmering like heat haze.

Suddenly, the floor beneath my feet isn't solid hardwood anymore. It transforms into shifting sand, the colour of burnt sienna. With every panicked breath I take, I sink a little deeper. The sand grains feel unnervingly warm, almost hot, and they begin to creep up my legs, a granular tide pulling me down. I try to move, to wrench myself free, but my limbs feel like lead, weighted down by the crushing gravity of my fear.

The presentation slides reappear, no longer confined to my mind’s eye. They project themselves onto the morphing walls, enormous and distorted. The text warps and writhes like cryptic symbols from an ancient, forgotten language. The clean graphs twist into monstrous shapes, their bars elongating into grasping claws. My carefully chosen images melt and drip down the walls like Dali clocks, their subjects leering with unsettling familiarity.

A clock materializes on one wall, its hands spinning with dizzying speed. Seconds blur into minutes, minutes into frantic loops. The ticking isn't a steady rhythm but a frantic, irregular heartbeat, mirroring the frantic pulse hammering in my temples and throat. Time is slipping away, liquefying like the images on the walls, each lost moment pulling me further down into the suffocating sand.

My prepared speech, the words I practiced until they felt like extensions of my own thoughts, crumbles into meaningless phonemes in my mouth. When I try to grasp a sentence, it disintegrates like ash. My voice, when I attempt to speak, comes out as a strangled croak, swallowed instantly by the heavy, expectant silence of the room.

The faint hum of anxiety has now escalated into a full-blown orchestral cacophony. It’s the screech of violins played with rusted saws, the mournful bellow of foghorns, the shattering crash of cymbals – all layered into an overwhelming soundscape of dread.

I look down. The sand is nearing my waist. It doesn't feel like sand anymore; it has the thick, viscous quality of quicksand, pulling relentlessly. Panic flares, hot and sharp. I thrash, but it only serves to pull me down faster. The air crackles with static electricity, raising the hairs on my arms. The sweet smell intensifies, becoming cloying, sickening.

Then, through the cacophony, a single, clear note emerges. It’s the chime of the elevator arriving, the sound that signals the *real* presentation is about to begin. But here, in the dreamscape, it’s a harbinger. The pulsating walls freeze mid-breath. The swirling text snaps into sharp, terrifying focus. The clock stops its frantic spin, its hands pointing directly, accusingly, at the appointed hour.

The sand reaches my chest, compressing my lungs. Breathing becomes a conscious, agonizing effort. The unseen audience, the source of the booming judgments, feels palpably close now, their collective gaze a physical pressure against my skin. They are waiting. And I am sinking, swallowed by the vibrant, terrifying landscape of my own anxiety, just moments before everything is supposed to begin. The world tilts, the last grains of sand rush towards my face, and the dream hangs, suspended in that final, suffocating moment of anticipation.Okay, eyes closed, sinking into that fuzzy space between wakefulness and sleep... The edges blur.

**I am dreaming.**

At first, it's just the low, persistent hum. Not a sound, exactly, but a vibration deep within my chest cavity, like a held bass note resonating through bone. It's the baseline anxiety, the background static against which the day's worries usually play out. But tonight, it's climbing in pitch, tightening.

My thoughts, unbidden, start to loop. *That slide transition. Was it smooth enough? Did I remember to cite Henderson's '78 paper? They'll know. They'll see straight through the bluff.* These aren't whispers; they arrive like ticker tape scrolling behind my eyelids, stark black text on a glaring white background, repeating, insistent. Each loop adds another layer to the hum, making it throb.

The scene clarifies slightly. I'm standing on a stage – not the sleek, modern one in the conference center, but a vast, ancient-looking proscenium made of dark, heavily grained wood. It feels enormous, stretching infinitely to the left and right under a single, stark spotlight that pins me in place. The air is thick and smells faintly of dust and ozone, like before a thunderstorm. In the infinite darkness beyond the spotlight's reach, I feel, rather than see, a countless audience. Their presence is a crushing weight, a collective, silent expectation.

My notes – where are my notes? I frantically pat my pockets, smooth down clothes I don't recognize wearing (scratchy wool? heavy velvet?). Nothing. Panic flares, hot and metallic tasting. The ticker tape behind my eyes speeds up: *UNPREPARED. FRAUD. IMPOSTER. FAILURE.*

The wooden stage beneath my feet begins to feel... wrong. It's subtly yielding, like tightly packed soil rather than sturdy planks. I look down. My shoes – polished leather moments ago – are now bare feet sinking slowly into dark, damp earth. Tendrils of shadow, like ink spilled in water, are creeping up from the edges of the light, swirling around my ankles. They feel cold, unnervingly alive.

The hum in my chest is now a palpable vibration shaking my ribs. The intrusive thoughts are no longer just text; they echo in the vast, unseen auditorium, distorted and amplified. *“Henderson’s paper… PAPER… Paper…”* bounces back, warped and mocking. *“Smooth transition… ISSION… Ission…”* dissolves into a sibilant hiss that seems to come from the swirling shadows around my legs.

My throat tightens. I try to clear it, to summon the opening lines I practiced COUNTLESS times. But only a dry, rasping sound emerges, instantly swallowed by the cavernous space. The spotlight above me seems to brighten, growing hotter, more accusatory. Sweat prickles my hairline, but it feels icy cold against my skin.

The earth – no, it's more like thick, viscous mud now – is up to my knees. It pulls with a greedy, sucking force. I try to lift a leg, straining with all my might, but it's like fighting against invisible chains. The effort makes my heart hammer against my ribs, each beat echoing the pounding *FAILURE… FAILURE… FAILURE…* reverberating from the darkness.

A glint of light catches my eye. Far out in the oppressive blackness, tiny pinpricks of light appear, like distant, predatory eyes. Hundreds of them. Thousands. They are the audience, finally revealing themselves, not as people, but as cold, unblinking observers. Their collective gaze feels like a physical pressure, pushing me down further into the mire.

The mud creeps higher, reaching my waist. It's thick with the cold, cloying scent of decay and damp stone. The shadows around my feet are no longer just swirling; they seem to be coalescing, forming indistinct shapes just beyond the edge of the light – hunched figures, waiting.

The ticker tape is frantic now, a jumbled mess of self-recrimination: *NOTGOODENOUGHWRONGWRONGSTUPIDMISTAKE*. I can feel my breath catching, each inhale a desperate, shallow gasp against the constricting mud and the crushing expectation. The stage, the mud, the watching eyes, the echoing thoughts – they are all converging, tightening like a vise. I am trapped, sinking, exposed under the glare of judgment, utterly consumed by the escalating roar of my own anxiety, just moments before I am supposed to speak. The world begins to tilt, the spotlight wavers, and the darkness surges inwards...
