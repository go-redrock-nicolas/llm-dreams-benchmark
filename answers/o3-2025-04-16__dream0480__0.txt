I am dreaming. It begins with you standing barefoot in a vast train station whose ceiling is a sky-sized stained-glass dome. Every pane is a different version of you—one in a vivid carnival mask, one in a stiff gray business suit, one in paint-splattered overalls, one quietly reading poetry under a willow tree. Sunlight pours through the dome, and each colored image casts its own hue onto your skin. The hues layer, overlap, fight for dominance, and in their shifting light you feel your pulse quicken: Which color is truly yours?

A whistle shrills. An ornate silver locomotive—half art deco, half clockwork masterpiece—hisses on the tracks below, its cars labeled with sweeping calligraphy: EXPECTATION, TRADITION, POLITENESS, and APPEARANCE. Uniformed conductors, faces smooth as porcelain masks, usher passengers aboard. They glance at you, tilt their heads, and in unison offer a bland, polite smile that feels like a subtle command: “Come along.”

For a moment you wobble between impulses. The masked version of you in the dome flickers kaleidoscopically, urging rebellion. The suit-clad reflection stares back with stern disapproval. You spot a single empty seat through the train’s gleaming windows—so perfectly placed, so undeniably reserved for you. The station’s marble tiles suddenly feel cold under your bare soles, the echo of heels and leather shoes drumming a metronome of conformity.

Your heart drums louder.

Instead of boarding, you look down and notice chalk in your palm—bright neon chalk that wasn’t there a breath ago. Kneeling, you draw a doorway right onto the floor: wild loops, spirals, and jagged lightning bolts, colors surging like tropical birds in flight. As you finish, the chalk graffiti thrums with life. The marble ripples, becoming liquid and brilliant, and a doorway of living light yawns open like some impossible blossom.

Inside that glowing entrance you glimpse a forest of suspended lanterns, each orb a miniature solar system orbiting a tiny, dancing figurine—all different expressions of you: laughing, shouting, weeping, singing. They beckon. Their music is a chorus of everything you’ve ever wanted to say but swallowed. You feel a tug from your very ribs, as though your truest self lives inside that secret grove.

Behind, the conductors call again—more urgent now. The stained-glass dome above you dims; the train’s engines churn, ready to leave. That empty seat gleams with the promise of safety, approval, simplicity. Your pulse splits in two rhythms: one steady and measured, one wild and syncopated.

You step through the chalk doorway.

Instantly you’re weightless—no gravity, no ceiling, only the constellations of lanterns swirling around you. One lantern drifts close. You peer in: it’s a miniature version of you at age seven, scrawling comic book heroes on classroom worksheets while the teacher’s voice drones on about “neat penmanship.” Another lantern reveals a teenage you singing off-key into a hairbrush, door locked, because your family despised noise after 9 p.m. You notice now: every lantern contains a compromise you once made to fit in, each with a tiny silver hook sealing it shut.

A soft chime rings. Silver keys materialize in your hand, humming with possibility. As you unlock the first lantern, the tiny hook snaps away and a gust of watercolor wind rushes out, painting vibrant designs across your skin. You feel lighter, clearer, as if your lungs have just discovered a deeper breath. One by one, you unlock the lanterns, releasing stored colors, sounds, words. The suspended orbs burst into nebulae that swirl up your arms and shoulders, until patterns bloom over you like living tattoos: lyrics, brushstrokes, laughter in foreign accents you’d once been too embarrassed to mimic.

At last there’s one lantern left, larger than the rest. Inside it crouches the current you, charcoal gray and shrinking. Its silver hook is thick, rusted with years of hesitation. Your hands tremble. A voice from the train station echoes faintly: “Last boarding call.”

You slide the biggest key into the lock. The lantern splits. A roaring gale of light erupts, engulfing everything. For one heartbeat you fear disintegration—but the gale merges with your own form. You’re no longer coated in colors; you’ve become the swirling palette itself. Wings of stained-glass feathers and graffiti clouds unfurl from your back. When you look at your hands, they’re luminous, transparent, threaded with starlight.

There is no gravity still, but you now have direction: forward.

You glide through the mural of dreamspace until you burst back into the train station—yet it’s transformed. The dome’s panes no longer compete; instead they fuse into a single, prismatic image of you mid-motion, wings ablaze, laughter blazing across your face. The conductors pause, porcelain masks cracking to reveal blank astonishment. The train lets out a long, hollow sigh. You realize: it can’t depart without you, and you have chosen not to board.

A hush falls. People on the platform stare, unsure whether to applaud or avert their eyes. Then a little girl with a crayon-stained backpack beams at you, waves, and points to her own chalk set. A domino of smiles ripples through the crowd. One suit-clad passenger steps off the train, unlatching his tie. Another removes her pristine gloves, revealing henna-tinted palms. Colors begin leaking everywhere—pulsing, radiant, unstoppable.

You stride toward the station’s exit, wings brushing the air, chalk doorway trailing behind. With every step you take, a path of luminous symbols appears—part footprints, part calligraphy of pure intention. The crowd follows, shedding masks, suits, hollow scripts. Together you step beyond the station into a dawn where the sun rises in polychrome layers like fresh paint across the horizon.

And as the new day brightens, you feel it: the tension is not a shackle but a springboard. Your authentic self isn’t an alternative to conformity; it’s the catalyst that dissolves conformity’s need altogether. The dream shifts to a lucid hush, and you hear your waking heartbeat blending with the wind of your wings.

Somewhere far behind, the silver locomotive waits on an empty track, steam curling into the sky—no longer a threat, merely an unused option.

You do not look back.
