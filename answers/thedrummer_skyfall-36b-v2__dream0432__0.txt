I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a vast, opulent palace, the likes of which I've never seen before. Gleaming marble floors stretch out before me in endless patterns, and soaring pillars adorned with intricate gold filigree seem to touch the heavens. The air is filled with the delicate scent of exotic flowers and the gentle sound of fluttering wings. You would think that this opulent space would be filled with treasures and delights. 

But instead, a deep sense of scarcity grips me. I began examining this paradox more closely. 

As I explore the palace, I come across room after room, each more extravagant than the last. One chamber is filled with an overwhelming array of sumptuous silks and luxurious fabrics in every shade imaginable, piled high on high tables. Another features a wall display showcasing the largest array of precious jewelry - rare gems, glinting gold, and glittering diamond encrusted jewelry, all sitting untouched. Passing by, I see a vast library filled to the brim with ancient tomes and whispered secrets from the past.

Yet, with each marvelous sight, the feeling of scarcity only intensifies. It's as if my mind is telling me that none of these blessings is enough, that I're lacking some critical part of myself and have been my whole life. I fastened my hands, desperately trying to gather as much as I could, to somehow fill the void inside me.

But the more I try to grasp it all, the more it slips through my fingers like sand. The fabrics feel rough and cheap, the jewels lose their luster, the books crumble to dust at my touch. The opulence around me dims and fades, like a mirage evaporating in the desert heat.

Suddenly, a figure appears before me - an ancient sage with eyes that seem to hold the wisdom of the universe. He regards me with profound compassion and says, "My child, you have been deceiving yourself. You already possess everything you seek - love, worth, and inner peace. The true wealth lies not in the abundance of the material world, but in the richness of your own spirit."

As his words wash over me, I begin to see the truth. The palace of plenty morphs into a serene garden, the  challenging voideed with fragrant blooms, the pillars replaced by tall, wise trees. I am surrounded by lush greenery, clear crystal brooks babbling gently, and unending fields of desire fulfilled.

But this isn't to say that I own a towering estate with flowing fountains or the rare work of art. No, the “true wealth” I possess is the awareness that I am enough just as I am, right now in this very moment.

The sage smiles knowingly and says, "Remember, my daughter. Your greatest treasure lies within you. No amount of external riches can ever fill the only kind of indescribable richness that is inherent in being.”

With that, I wake up, the vivid dream fading away. But the message lingers, a powerful reminder of what truly matters. I'm left with a deep understanding that the feeling of abundance and scarcity is an internal construct, not determined by the external world. When I nourish my innermost self with self-love, acceptance, and gratitude, I realize I already have everything I've ever dreamed of.
