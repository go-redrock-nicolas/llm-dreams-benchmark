I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a place where the sky is not quite blue and not quite purple, but some shimmering, opalescent in-between. It seems to ripple in slow waves above your head, as if reality itself is breathing. It feels like nighttime, but there is a faint gleam on the horizon that creates the illusion of early dawn. A pale crescent moon hovers above you, winked at by one lone star that pulses like a heartbeat.

At first, your eyes remain locked on a single object: an impossibly tall tree. Its trunk spirals upward in gnarled twists and knots, and its leaves glow with a color you’ve never encountered—like a midnight teal touched by starlight. You can hardly shift your gaze from it, transfixed by the smoky lines tracing across the bark. Yet, in the corners of your vision, there is movement you dimly register—something flickering like tiny lights in a forest floor.

Taking a conscious breath, you broaden your focus. As your attention flutters away from the towering tree, you notice the ground is spongy and luminescent, as though it’s made from the many-layered petals of a giant phosphorescent flower. With each step, a swirl of glowing dust puffs upward in gauzy, pastel tones—lavender, dusty pink, and pale blue—drifting through the air before dissolving like dandelion seeds. You’re delighted to realize these motes release subtle, tinkling chimes that sound like music played by the smallest of bells.

What you first took for fireflies are actually miniature phoenixes, no larger than your thumb. Their feathers sparkle in gold and burgundy, trailing delicate plumes of light. Each phoenix flits around your ankles, singeing small arcs of smoke in the air. You notice a gentle heat emanating from them, comforting and safe, as if they simply want to illuminate the path that unfurls beneath your feet. Their playful circling invites you deeper between the pillars of ancient, knotted roots.

In the periphery, silhouettes shift—perhaps old spirits or illusions conjured by your mind—soft images of creatures whose shapes melt away if you try to stare straight at them. Laughter—muffled and distant—echoes through your dream, nudging you to explore this domain further. A gust of perfumed breeze drifts through, carrying an indescribably sweet scent that stirs a warm nostalgia in your heart. You close your eyes, feeling an inexplicable sense of loving welcome from everything around you, as if the dream is cartography for your own hidden landscapes.

Your gaze opens even wider, and you sense new textures emerging: the hush of hidden waterfalls, a road weaving through the brambles, and a half-glimpsed city made of frosty glass rising in the distance. You realize, in a flash of insight, that this wondrous place lives within the corners of your mind, always waiting for you to see it. The more you notice, the deeper the dream becomes—each step on the glowing ground an invitation to venture further into the unknown. And as you walk, your heart brims with quiet joy, realizing that all of these wonders were within your vision all along, simply waiting to be seen.
