I am dreaming. Beneath a sky of swirling indigo clouds that pulse like living veins, I stand at the helm of an impossible city—a place where skyscrapers twist like gnarled crystal trees, and rivers of liquid starlight flow through streets paved with whispering tiles. The air smells of burnt cinnamon and unraveling secrets. Around me, my team—silhouettes woven from shadow and fractured light—dissolve one by one, their forms unraveling into flocks of iridescent moths that scatter toward a hungry moon. The remaining project—a hovering, pulsing orb of raw potential—thrums louder, its surface rippling with half-formed equations and unborn symphonies. The client? A colossal being of writhing clockwork and stained-glass wings, perched atop the shuddering skyline, staring down with twelve unblinking eyes. 

Somewhere beyond the dream, muscles twitch in my sleeping limbs as tension builds. My subconscious conjures a survival toolkit from the void—a satchel filled with glass vials of liquid resilience (glowing like molten courage), a pen that writes in bridges made of others' untapped potential, and a compass needle that points toward abandoned ideas left by the departed, now ripe for revival. The whispering tiles beneath my feet begin to murmur strategies in a language of chimes and static, revealing that the moths didn't flee—they migrated to a hidden dimension where time drips like amber. If I can catch just three in my cupped palms before the next toll of the floating obsidian bell, their wings will contain compressed wisdom from the departed teammates. 

Breath quickening in both dream and reality, I sprint through a corridor of inverted waterfalls, leaping over gaps in logic that try to swallow my ankles. The dream reshapes itself—now I'm navigating the project-orb's interior, where chaos crystallizes into structure under my touch. Walls melt into collaborative flowcharts; frustration transmutes into a tangible fuel source, burning in glass orbs that float like will-o'-wisps around my head. The clockwork client's ticking slows—not in mercy, but in dawning respect—as I stitch together a solution from stolen time, moth-wing insights, and the radiant stress pouring from my own dream-form's fingertips. Just before waking, the entire city inhales sharply… and the project pulses once, brilliantly, in perfect alignment.  

Then—alarm clock. But the taste of liquid stardust lingers on my tongue for three slow blinks toward the ceiling.
