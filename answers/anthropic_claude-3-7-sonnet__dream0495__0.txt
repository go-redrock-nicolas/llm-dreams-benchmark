I am dreaming. A labyrinth of silvery mist stretches before me, pathways shimmering with the memory of purpose. I stand at its threshold, hands outstretched, feeling the familiar weight of accomplishments that once filled me with boundless joy now pass through my fingers like water.

The landscape shifts—I'm climbing a mountain made of books I've read, paintings I've created, goals I've achieved. Each step should feel triumphant, yet the summit seems both closer and farther with every footfall. The rich colors that once painted my passions have faded to watercolor whispers.

From somewhere deep within the dream, music plays—melodies I once loved—but now they echo differently in the chambers of my heart. I follow the sound through a forest where trees bear fruit shaped like clocks, each showing different moments when purpose felt certain and clear.

A figure approaches through the mist—it's me from the past, eyes bright with ambition. We sit beside a river of flowing mercury that reflects not our faces but the landscapes of futures yet unexplored.

"The meaning doesn't vanish," my reflection whispers, "it transforms."

The sky above cracks open, revealing not emptiness but infinite possibility—constellations forming new patterns, unfamiliar but beckoning. I feel myself dissolving into this sky, becoming both less and more than before, as understanding blooms within me like a midnight flower:

Purpose isn't a destination but a conversation between who I've been and who I might become.

I awaken—or do I?—with my hands cupping stardust, ready to sculpt meaning anew.
