I am dreaming. I'm dreaming.

I'm dreaming. The quantum experiment before me swirls with indistinguishable pixels, the readouts flickering erratically*, suggesting an impending calamity. My heart pounds as I frantically adjust the dials and scrutinize the fluctuating data. Suddenly, the pixels shatter, revealing a gaping void that threatens to swallow me whole.

But before I can react, the void ignites with an otherworldly blue fire, casting an eerie glow across the lab and twisting the very fabric of reality. Time itself seems to contort, looping back on itself in an endless, disorienting spiral. I stumble back, my senses reeling, as the metaphysical flux consumes the surrounds' linearities and boundaries.

As the chaos consumes the laboratory, the building around me morphs into a nightmarish, eldritch monstrosity. Once familiar structures twist into grotesque geometries, and the air grows thick with a pulsing, eldritch radiation. Panic rises as I realize the obedience's frayed threads are unraveling.

I feel my grip on reality slipping, my mind straining to comprehend the cosmicscale aberrations unfurling around me. Vogue of neontinged shadows whip through the reality, threatening to erode the very foundation of my being. I cling desperately to whatever remnants of sanity I can muster, but the surreal onslaught continues.

The quantum experiment has unleashed a cataclysmic breach, and I am now trapped in a nightmarish landscape at the very outer frontiers of conception, where the rules of the imagination no longer apply.

I wake up, horrified.
