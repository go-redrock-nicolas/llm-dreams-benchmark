I am dreaming.

The first thing I feel is the wind—so sharp it whistles like a blade—racing across a plateau of black crystal. We have set up our command post here, on the roof of the world, because the stakes can be trusted to no place lesser. Beneath the transparent floor plates, magma glows in slow orange swirls, lighting the underside of our boots as though the earth were an enormous lantern. Overhead hangs a sky so dark it seems to drink starlight; in the distance a single aurora shudders like a torn ribbon of emerald.

The operation: relocate the Heart of Thuban, a living gem the size of a cargo jet, pulsing with enough stored energy to reset seasons, tides, civilizations. If it overheats, it will collapse in on itself and leave a crater where reality used to be. If it cools too much, it will fissure and scatter its power like radioactive snow. Our mission, then, is simple in wording: convey it twenty-three miles across the plateau and embed it in the stasis cradle before dawn. The cradle is already lit like a spiderweb of violet lightning, waiting to swallow the gem whole.

My team moves around me in sleek heat-resistant suits. We glide along sidewalk-wide conveyor belts that circle the gem like petals around a flower. Each belt hums beneath our feet, ready to ferry us to instrument stations. Holographic dashboards float like translucent chandeliers in the air, projecting strings of purple numbers that writhe like snakes. It’s beautiful, frightening—and the gem at the center exhales a slow heartbeat of crimson light every six seconds, a rhythmic reminder of how alive danger can feel.

We begin transport. The gem rises, cushioned by a lattice of anti-gravity drones—silver spheres with wings of folded moonlight. They emit a hum so deep it lodges in the bones. Everything trembles. For a moment I’m certain we’re perfect: every light green, every vector arrow aligned with its twin.

Then, like chalk squealing across granite, the first error surfaces.

“Trajectory variance point five degrees,” Lt. Nara whispers. She’s in charge of drone telemetry. Her voice crackles with static, the audio feed suddenly molting into shards. A half-degree is nothing in everyday life; in this environment it’s a dagger. One misalignment and the drones will tug the gem unevenly, fracturing its crystalline lattice.

“Compensate,” I answer, fingers skating across the holograms. My virtual keypad leaves after-images of neon turquoise in the air. I shift drone five, adjust drone twelve, recalc balance vectors. For a breath the gem steadies. I allow myself a single heartbeat of relief.

Another slip. This time it’s the cooling rime overlay. Tech Mori has set the coolant frequency two hertz too low. The gem’s outer facets start to sweat plasma, pale ruby droplets sliding down invisible curves. We should be cocooning it in a frost as delicate as spider silk. Instead the heat is rising like a thousand exhalations of molten glass.

“Correct to baseline,” I bark. Mori’s gloved hands shake; he nods, dials up the coolant, fog blossoming in white plumes around the gem. The droplets sizzle out of existence, but an uneasy silence spreads through the team, the knowledge of fallibility hanging like cold breath between us.

The plateau’s atmosphere reacts to our stress. Storm clouds coil on a dime, opening like ink stains across the stars. Lightning leaps down in violet arcs, striking the crystal floor and diffusing into nets of electric frost. Everything here is symbiotic: thought, fear, environment. I have to stay calm, or the world will mimic my panic.

We continue. The gem drifts, a monarch butterfly forged of ruby, escorted by its metallic swarm. Half the distance covered.

Another mistake.

“Field strength at the perimeter’s fluctuating!” This from Roux, the field integrator. On her screen the containment plane jitters, jagged peaks forming in what should be a smooth energy shell. Those spikes are spear points aimed inward. If the shield collapses, the drones lose their balancing cushion. The gem will drop.

I visualize the worst case: the gem punches through the crystal plateau and plunges into the magma below. Pressure waves bloom; the Heart of Thuban detonates; we become bedtime stories told by survivors orbiting some distant refuge.

“Route power from reserve batteries,” I say, but even in the dream I sense the fear starting to own us, each team member a candle about to blow out in the wind. My own resolve wavers—just for a breath—and the sky hears it. Thunder rolls like giant drums. I exhale, summon an image: still water, unbroken. The thunder recedes. Calm.

Reserve power flows. The shield stabilizes. The gem floats onward.

But the plateau decides to test us one last time. The crystal floor cracks—hairline splinters racing out from beneath our feet, red magma ghosts glowing in the seams. The conveyors buckle, drones buck in the turbulence, and the gem dips thirty centimeters. I lunge onto the main deck, slam a palm against the central hologram and shout into every headset:

“Manual override. Full sync.”

The team obeys, fear burned away by urgency. Our gloves fuse with console nodes; each member’s heartbeat appears on my display, little gold pulses. I can feel them—literally feel them—like drums in my ribs. Eleven different rhythms weave into mine until we are one animal with twelve hearts.

In that unity we move the drones not as separate pilots but as one contiguous neural field. They realign, whirring in iridescent arcs. The gem rises—higher—steadier—its facets refract the lightning like shards of dawn. Our combined breath is a tide, pulling the gem across the last hundred yards, through the whirlpool of crackling air, into the maw of the stasis cradle.

The cradle’s lattice snaps shut with the subtlety of a flower closing at night. Ribbons of violet electricity snare the gem, siphon heat, lull it into dormancy. The plateau sighs; the floor fractures fuse, the magma glow dims, and the sky’s storm clouds dissolve into gentle snow of blue sparks.

Silence.

Then, like distant bells, the aurora resumes its dance, sweeping green ribbons across a sky suddenly alight with meteors. My team removes helmets. We grin—exhausted, alive. Each error, each pulse of terror, has been woven into a tapestry of success.

I lean back, let the phantom snow gather on my eyelashes. The operation complete, the plateau slowly fades, each crystal tile turning transparent until the world is nothing but a field of stars. Weightless now, I drift among them, my team’s laughter echoing like chimes. The Heart of Thuban beats once, an enormous crimson eclipse behind my eyelids, then winks out like a candle.

I wake—still dreaming or perhaps not—remembering only the taste of starlight and the lesson that mistakes, when faced, can bind people together tighter than any triumph untested by fear.
