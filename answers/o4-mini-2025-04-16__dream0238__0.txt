I am dreaming. I drift into the vision: a molten sky, bruised purple and amber, pulses like a living heartbeat overhead. I stand on a cracked veranda of a vast marble pavilion—its columns twist like spirals of smoke—commanding the evacuation of thousands streaming past me in luminous robes. Their faces glow with fear and hope, each footstep stirring motes of golden dust that dance around their ankles.

A distant roar rises from the valley below: the earth itself splitting open in jagged seams, oozing a silvery liquid that hisses against polished stone. Every siren in my mind screams: “Protocols—obsolete!” I clutch the rusted evacuation manual in my hand; its pages have tumbled loose, fluttering away like wounded birds. The standard routes have collapsed into sinkholes, while the backup routes are swallowed by creeping vines of ebony thorns.

Time thunders forward. I taste copper on my tongue, feel sweat beading at my temples as I pivot. Without a blueprint, I must become both architect and herald. Shards of broken glass swirl at my feet, each reflecting a fragment of a forbidden escape plan. My voice cracks through the haze: “Follow the river of starlight!” Instantly, people lift their heads. Somewhere, a child’s laughter bubbles up, fragile but certain, and I seize upon it.

In the distance, a river of bioluminescent water snakes between crumbling walls. I leap onto the ledge and point, my arm slicing through the dream-smoke. “This way—down through the chalcedony cavern, past the whispering pillars!” The crowd hesitates, but the ground trembles further, sending tremors through their knees. Panic flickers in their eyes until I draw a deep breath and step forward. They follow.

We descend into the undercroft: rock walls pulsating with veins of molten crystal. Each footstep rings like a bell tolling the apocalypse—yet also the promise of survival. Lantern-winged fireflies swarm overhead, their glow a living map. I realize the evacuation is no longer about blind obedience to rules, but about trust—in my own heartbeat, in the silent collaboration of strangers, in the strange map drawn by insects’ wings.

On the lowest tier, the cavern opens onto an endless plain of ash and ember. Down here, the air is thick with the scent of scorched earth and jasmine. Beyond, a shattered transport platform hovers precariously above a sea of glowing coals. I scrap away remaining protocol from memory—because here, conventional solutions would kill us. Instead, I cup my hands and whisper a word I’ve never spoken aloud, one woven from instinct and desperation. Beneath my fingers, the platform trembles back to life, humming with a gentle, ascending pulse.

We clamber aboard. As the transport lifts, I look back: the pavilion shatters, the marble dissolving into motes of dust that rise to join the molten sky. Around me, evacuees hold hands; we are bound not by procedure but by a shared leap into the unknown. The platform dips and sways, carrying us over the fractured world. Beneath us, the valley erupts in a final, deafening crescendo of flame and ash.

Then—stillness. The dream shifts and I feel the platform touch down in a field of phosphorescent grasses that wave above a quiet, glassy lake. The survivors spill out, blinking under a sky now calm, every star visible. I stand on the transport’s edge, the wind carrying whispers of relief and fragile laughter. My heart pounds with the residue of crisis, yet I know: we rewrote the rules. Together, we discovered that when all protocols fail, imagination—and trust—become our greatest escape routes.
