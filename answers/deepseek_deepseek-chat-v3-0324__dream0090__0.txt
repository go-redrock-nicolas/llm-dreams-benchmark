I am dreaming. The air hums with a strange, electric tension, thick with the scent of ozone and crushed petals. The sky above is an impossible mosaic—swirling violet and gold, fractured like a shattered mirror, yet holding together by some unseen force. The arena before me is neither land nor water, but shifting terrain that breathes beneath my feet, rippling like the skin of a living thing.  

The final challenge has begun.  

I step forward, and the ground turns to glass beneath my boots—clear as a frozen lake, but when I peer down, I see no reflection. Instead, infinite layers of past versions of myself stretch into the abyss, each with a different fate—some victorious, some broken, some not me at all. A voice booms without sound, resonating in my bones: *Choose your weapon.*  

A table materializes, bearing objects that throb with latent power—an hourglass leaking black sand, a mirror with a shifting face, a key that flickers between solid and smoke.  

But I reach beyond them.  

My fingers close around a sword that wasn’t there a second ago—its blade is forged from liquid moonlight, its hilt wrapped in threads of forgotten songs. The moment I grasp it, the sky cracks open, raining down shards of stained glass that reform midair into winged judges, their eyes like dying stars.  

"This isn’t just a trial of skill," the nearest one whispers, though its mouth doesn’t move. "This is a duel against the version of you that gave up."  

And then *it* steps forward from the shadows—another me, but older, weary, made of ashes and resignation. It raises a blade of rust and broken promises.  

The first strike shakes the dream to its core. I parry, but the clash sends waves of color exploding outward, rewriting the landscape with every spark. The ground becomes a chessboard. The sky becomes a storm of whispered regrets.  

I can’t lose. Not now. Not after clawing my way here through nightmares and false dawns.  

So I *sing*—not with my voice, but with the sword, with my pulse, with the unrealized futures spiraling beneath my feet. The melody splits the air, and for a breathless second, the entire dream holds still.  

Then everything collapses…  

And I wake up, gripping nothing, but changed.  

The competition is over.  

The real one has just begun.
