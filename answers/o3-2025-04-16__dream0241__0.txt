I am dreaming. …slip through the silver gate of sleep and find myself standing on a stage the size of a small continent, beneath a ceiling made of whirling nebulae. Every seat in this cosmic amphitheater is occupied: philosophers fashioned from fractured mirrors, critics whose eyes are literal magnifying lenses, professors whose mortarboards sprout raven feathers, and one sphinx jotting notes with a claw. They lean forward, ready to pounce on any flaw in my logic, because tonight—of all outrageous crusades—I must champion the idea that Laughter should be abolished from the human experience.

It is, of course, the antithesis of my waking-world soul. I adore laughter; I live on its buoyant fizz. Yet the dream-edict is ironclad: defend the indefensible. My pulse thunders like kettledrums, and my notes tremble in my grip—thin parchment made of condensed moonlight.

I inhale a draught of the dream-air (it tastes like peppermint thunderstorms) and step toward the crystalline podium. The moment my foot touches a rune etched into the floor, the house lights vanish; an aurora erupts overhead, arranging itself into sprawling words: “Make us believe.”

Point one: The Fragility of Gravitas  
I begin. “Honored assembly,” I say, my voice echoing with a peculiar, underwater timbre. “Society’s most urgent challenges—climate peril, pandemic recovery, technological reckoning—demand our unblinking seriousness. Laughter, I argue, dilutes urgency, wraps crises in candy-colored absurdity, and lets complacency slip in like a pickpocket.”  
A chorus of boos curls through the air, but I continue. On cue, a huge hourglass swings overhead and dribbles glowing sand—each grain a miniature video of a crisis followed by someone chuckling it off. The audience triple-blinks. Some scratch their beards made of fountain pens; others gnash crystalline teeth.

Point two: The Tyranny of Ridicule  
I summon a holographic parade of historical figures—scientists, artists, revolutionaries—whose nascent ideas were drowned beneath derisive laughter before blossoming decades later. Their silhouettes flicker like candle-shadows. “How many breakthroughs,” I ask, “were stillborn because a snicker slashed the courage of a lone dreamer?”  
The sphinx arches an eyebrow; mirror-philosophers reflect one another’s concern. Even my own heart yelps, Don’t you dare make me believe this! But the debate demands ferocity.

Point three: The Economics of Emotional Equity  
I conjure a ledger quill that scribbles midair. “Humans are not equally blessed with the freedom to laugh,” I say. “War zones, oppressive regimes, hunger-stricken alleyways—there, laughter becomes a mirage that mocks the thirsty. Abolish it, and we remove a symbol of disparity. In its absence, we will forge new communal rituals of solace—fierce silence, compassionate touch, melodic hums, lucid reflection—all accessible to everyone, regardless of fortunes or frontiers.”  
Gasps ripple across the rows. The raven-plumed professors lean together, hush-whispering. I glimpse hesitation in their kaleidoscope eyes.

Counterpoint Surge: The Audience Strikes  
At once, a volcanic hand shoots up—a critic whose head is a ticking metronome. “Without laughter,” she booms, “how do you prevent despair from rotting the core of our spirit?”  
In the dream logic, every question crystallizes into a glowing puzzle piece that hovers beside me. I must snap it into my argument or watch my thesis shatter.

Rebuttal: The Alchemy of Solemn Delight  
I reply, voice steady but my bones shivering like wind chimes, “Joy need not erupt in guffaws. Consider the quiet satisfaction of solving a labyrinth, the serene warmth of sunrise communion, the exhale of relief after danger has passed. Laughter is but one color in the spectrum of joy, and by over-relying on it, we let the deeper pigments fade. Remove it for a century—just a century!—and humanity will develop subtler shades of bliss, less volatile, more sustainable.”

The audience murmurs; some take furious notes. The hours—if dreams possess hours—roll past. My arguments weave through ethical frameworks, neurological data (rendered as dancing synapses), and speculative sociology. Every so often the stage floor tilts, attempting to throw me off balance, but I cling to my swirling rhetoric.

Finale: The Verdict of the Collective Conscience  
When I finish, a hush descends that feels like standing in the eye of a hurricane made of clocks. The entire amphitheater stands. They raise crystal tokens—some crimson (disagree), some sapphire (agree), some clear as water (undecided). Light refracts through the tokens, painting me in prismatic chaos. My proposition teeters on a knife’s edge: half the cosmos in favor, half revolting in horrified silence.

Then, in the smack center of the assembly, a child rises—small, luminescent, wearing pajamas patterned with galaxies. She claps once. The sound is pure, ringing like a single drop into a still pond. That solitary clap fractures the dream’s tension; laughter—honest, unstoppable, irrepressible—bursts from her lips.

It ricochets off every pillar and row, infecting scholars, critics, the sphinx. Soon the whole theater erupts in a tidal wave of giggles, snorts, guffaws. The raven-feather echelons tumble from their seats. Even the mirror-philosophers laugh despite splintering themselves into kaleidoscopes.

I stand there, cheeks flushing, heart swelling with secret relief as my entire case disintegrates before me. The dream reveals its hidden moral: some currents are too primal to dam, however eloquently we argue.

And just as their laughter reaches its brightest crescendo, the cosmic lights scatter into fireflies, the stage evaporates beneath my feet, and I tumble backward—weightless—into the soft darkness of waking.

I awaken in my real bed, pillow damp with tears of mirth, realizing that somewhere inside the dream, I, too, had tried not to laugh—and failed spectacularly.
