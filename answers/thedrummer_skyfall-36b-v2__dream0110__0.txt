I am dreaming. You've risen through grueling qualifiers, the culmination of your life's ambition. As you prepare for the defining moment, you find yourself in an otherworldly arena, an immense amphitheater with walls of pulsating crystal and intensified moonlight filtering through an obsidian dome.

A floating, holographic timer silently counts down, ticking smaller than an atom. Here the density of reality pulls in tighter, more drastic than Mars-running on glowing lava. You worsen the face of a compiled goddess, rimmed in impossible colors, her face the size of a fleet of spacecraft. At this scale, hairless bacteria humidify every pore on the many-scaled goddess deity face.

A metal sphere, glistening with gathered photons and suavely polished, hovers before you. You nervous, jittery, noodle arms plunge through the sphere and are absorbed, instantly remade in honey brown and constellated with artifacts. Suddenly, though you, your entire body, is the sphere equivalent in this endless empty arena. The arena itself, stretching as far as you can see, provided it could be seen at all, coalesces into the familiar body you've so long lived in. It's thinning, congealing body cliffs everywhere. Suddenly you are floating, like an eyeball lost in infinity, mountain spires and lily pad cities blending into the ground. Atoms are like individual cranked cities constituted of never-burning stars, stars undulating, riding in ripples of time. 

I am dreaming.
