I am dreaming. I am dreaming, yet the tension feels all too real, pricking at my nerves with icy needles of urgency. I stand atop a crumbling overpass, wind shrieking through the twisted steel and broken concrete, the air thick with the metallic tang of blood and ozone. Far below, in the flood-lit gloom, my city convulses with disaster—a hurricane’s lashing tail driving black water over neighborhoods, a firestorm smoldering in the industrial district, sirens rising and falling in a never-ending litany of distress.

My earpiece crackles with overlapping voices—the mayor, frantic, demanding we focus every unit on evacuating the gilded downtown; the governor pounding the table, insisting we open the bridges to fleeing suburbs instead; a federal coordinator threatening to land military helicopters in the city square whether I clear a path or not. Maps flicker on the screens in my ruined command tent, red splotches growing, eating away the places we’d designated as safe.

I look at the dwindling roster of available responders—some shivering in soaked uniforms, eyes wide and hollow from sleeplessness, others pressing bloody rags to wounds they don’t have time to treat. Food stores are down to ration crackers and bottled water, supplies evaporating with every hour. The growing hum of fear pricks the air, heavy and electric.

Letting the noise wash over me for a moment, I close my eyes and imagine my city as a living organism, arteries and veins pulsing with traffic and hope. Now, those arteries are severed; the heart stutters.

Taking a shaky breath, I start issuing orders—not to the politicians, but to my people: **Split up rescue teams based on need, not privilege. Rig the hospital’s backup generators with borrowed fuel from abandoned cars. Turn the empty schools into shelters, strip every supply closet bare. Patch in a local radio host to broadcast clear information, because confusion is killing as surely as fire.**

I can feel the weight of the leaders’ fury, their voices rising—accusing, warning, threatening. But I press on, my voice low and clear amid the chaos, *Do what you can, where you are. Save who you can. Don't wait for permission. We serve the living, not the powerful.*

As the dream crests, I see a rescue boat emerging from the flood, headlights blinding beneath the unnatural twilight. Children stumble ashore, faces streaked and frightened, but alive. Above, the smoke parts, and for a moment, there is clarity—a fragile bridge between catastrophe and hope, built with the last dregs of courage as the city, wounded but unbroken, breathes on.
