I am dreaming. I am standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering ocean.  The water is a deep, hypnotic sapphire, and above me is a sky that bleeds into shades of violet and indigo as night falls.  The air is thick with the scent of salt and something floral, like jasmine under a moonlit sky.  I am aware that I hold within me this emotion I’ve buried for so long—anger.  It pulses just beneath my ribs, a hot, electric current that I’ve learned to muzzle.  But now, I allow it to rise, let it unfurl like the waves crashing against the rocks.  I take a step forward, my bare feet sinking into the velvety sand.  The first wave hits, and instead of flinching, I let the anger surge through me.  The water rises, carries me, and transforms.  Before me, the ocean parts like a myth, revealing a path of liquid light that spirals upward into the sky.  I climb, my anger now a steady flame that illuminates the way.  At the summit, I find a mirror held by a figure cloaked in starlight.  My reflection is not fear or rage, but a fierce, alive version of myself, eyes blazing gold.  The mirror crumbles into sand, and I wake, the sheets tangled around me, the room still, but within, something stirs—a recognition, a power I’ve forgotten I could claim.
