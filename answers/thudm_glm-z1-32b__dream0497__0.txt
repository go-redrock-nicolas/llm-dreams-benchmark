I am dreaming. Suddenly I am aware of the soft, deep blue sky above me, stretching endlessly, with clouds that seem to<beginofsentence># 1. The Triangle and<beginofsentence>Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a triangle and the inscribed circle. Let me start by reading the problem again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked. The problem says:

"In triangle ABC, the inscribed circle touches side BC at point D. If AB = 7 cm, AC = 5 cm, and BD = 2 cm, find the length of DC."

Alright, so we have triangle ABC with sides AB = 7 cm, AC = 5 cm, and the point where the incircle touches BC is D, with BD = 2 cm. We need to find DC. 

First, I recall that in a triangle, the lengths from the vertices to the points where the incircle touches the sides are related to the semiperimeter. The semiperimeter (s) is half the perimeter of the triangle. The formula for the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency is: if the incircle touches BC at D, AC at E, and AB at F, then BD = s - AC, DC = s - AB, and so on. Wait, let me confirm that. 

Yes, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency can be found using the semiperimeter. Specifically, BD = s - AC, DC = s - AB, AF = s - BC, etc. This is because the two tangent segments from a single point outside a circle are equal in length. 

So, in this problem, BD is given as 2 cm. According to the formula, BD = s - AC. We can write that as:

BD = s - AC

We know BD is 2 cm, and AC is 5 cm, so:

2 = s - 5

Solving for s:

s = 2 + 5 = 7 cm

But wait, the semiperimeter s is (AB + BC + AC)/2. Let me check that. If s = 7 cm, then the perimeter is 14 cm. But we know AB is 7 cm, AC is 5 cm. So BC would be 14 - 7 - 5 = 2 cm? But BD is already 2 cm, and BD is part of BC. That can't be right because BD is just a part of BC, so BC must be longer than BD. Wait, there's a mistake here.

Hold on, let me start over. The semiperimeter formula for the tangent lengths is BD = s - AC, DC = s - AB. So if BD = 2, then s - AC = 2. AC is 5, so s = 2 + 5 = 7. Then DC = s - AB = 7 - 7 = 0? That can't be possible. Clearly, I'm making an error here.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formulas. Let me check again. The lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency are as follows:

If the incircle touches BC at D, AC at E, and AB at F, then:

BD = BF = s - AC

DC = CE = s - AB

AF = AE = s - BC

So BD = s - AC = 7 - 5 = 2, which matches the given BD = 2. Then DC = s - AB = 7 - 7 = 0? That doesn't make sense because DC is part of BC, so it can't be zero. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my approach.

Wait a second, if s is 7, then the perimeter is 14. But AB is 7, AC is 5, so BC would be 14 - 7 - 5 = 2 cm. But BD is 2 cm, which would mean BC is 2 cm, so DC = BC - BD = 2 - 2 = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, which suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the formulas are different. Let me verify the correct formulas for the tangent lengths. 

In a triangle, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency of the incircle are given by:

BD = s - b

DC = s - a

Where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to A, B, C respectively. Wait, perhaps I confused the notation. Let me clarify.

Let’s denote the sides as follows:

In triangle ABC, let BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.

Then, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

The lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency are:

- From A: AF = AE = s - a

- From B: BF = BD = s - c

- From C: CD = CE = s - b

Wait, maybe that's the correct notation. Let's check a source or derive it.

Yes, actually, the lengths are as follows:

The tangents from a point to a circle are equal. So, from point B, the tangents to the incircle are BD and BF, so BD = BF = s - AC (since AC is the side opposite to B, which is denoted as b). Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, let's use standard notation:

Let’s denote the sides as:

a = BC

b = AC

c = AB

Then, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2

Then, the lengths are:

BD = s - b

DC = s - c

Similarly, AF = AE = s - a

BF = BD = s - b

CD = CE = s - c

Wait, let me verify. If BD = s - b, then BD = (a + b + c)/2 - b = (a + c - b)/2

Similarly, DC = s - c = (a + b + c)/2 - c = (a + b - c)/2

But in our problem, BD is given as 2 cm, and BD should be equal to s - b, where b is AC = 5 cm.

So, BD = s - 5 = 2  s = 7

Then, DC = s - c = 7 - 7 = 0? Again, same problem. That can't be right. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my approach must be incorrect.

Wait, but the problem states AB = 7 cm, AC = 5 cm. Let's write down all sides:

AB = c = 7 cm

AC = b = 5 cm

BC = a = ?

Semiperimeter s = (a + 7 + 5)/2 = (a + 12)/2

Then, BD = s - b = (a + 12)/2 - 5 = (a + 12 - 10)/2 = (a + 2)/2

But the problem states BD = 2 cm. Therefore:

(a + 2)/2 = 2  a + 2 = 4  a = 2 cm

But BC = a = 2 cm, which would make DC = BC - BD = 2 - 2 = 0 cm, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the given lengths are impossible? That can't be. The problem must have a solution, so I must be making a mistake in applying the formulas.

Wait a second, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let's check again. Maybe BD is s - AC, which would be s - b. Yes, BD = s - b. So BD = (a + b + c)/2 - b = (a + c - b)/2

Given BD = 2, b = 5, c = 7:

2 = (a + 7 - 5)/2  2 = (a + 2)/2  Multiply both sides by 2: 4 = a + 2  a = 2

So BC = 2 cm. Then DC = BC - BD = 2 - 2 = 0 cm. But that's impossible because DC is part of BC, so it must be positive. Therefore, the problem as stated has no solution? But the user is asking to find DC, implying there is a solution. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is DC = s - AB. Let's check that. If DC = s - AB, then DC = s - c = (a + 12)/2 - 7 = (a + 12 - 14)/2 = (a - 2)/2

But BC = a = BD + DC = 2 + DC. So:

a = 2 + DC

But DC = (a - 2)/2

So substituting a = 2 + DC into DC = (a - 2)/2:

DC = (2 + DC - 2)/2 = (DC)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

2DC = DC  2DC - DC = 0  DC = 0

Again, DC = 0. Which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that with the given values, such a triangle cannot exist. But the problem is presented as solvable. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misapplication of the formula.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the notation. Let's try a different approach. Let's denote the triangle sides as follows:

Let’s let BC = a, AB = c = 7, AC = b = 5.

The incircle touches BC at D, so BD = s - b, DC = s - c

Wait, that's what I did before, leading to a = 2, DC = 0.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is DC = s - AB, which would be s - c.

Yes, that's correct. So DC = s - c = (a + b + c)/2 - c = (a + b - c)/2

Similarly, BD = s - b = (a + c - b)/2

Given BD = 2, so:

(a + 7 - 5)/2 = 2  (a + 2)/2 = 2  a + 2 = 4  a = 2

Then DC = (2 + 5 - 7)/2 = (0)/2 = 0. Again, DC = 0. Impossible.

So, this suggests that the given lengths AB = 7, AC = 5, and BD = 2 lead to BC = 2, which makes DC = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem as stated is impossible. But the user is asking for a solution, so perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe I have the formulas reversed. Let's check a different source. For example, in standard triangle formulae:

In a triangle, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency of the incircle are given by:

BD = (AB + BC - AC)/2

Similarly, DC = (AC + BC - AB)/2

Wait, let me confirm that. The formula for the length from vertex B to the point of tangency on BC (which is D) is (AB + BC - AC)/2. Similarly, from C to D is (AC + BC - AB)/2.

Yes, that's another way to write it. Let's verify:

BD = (AB + BC - AC)/2

DC = (AC + BC - AB)/2

So, BD + DC = BC, which makes sense.

Given BD = 2, AB = 7, AC = 5. Let's plug into BD's formula:

2 = (7 + BC - 5)/2  2 = (2 + BC)/2  Multiply both sides by 2: 4 = 2 + BC  BC = 2 cm

Then, DC = (5 + 2 - 7)/2 = (0)/2 = 0 cm. Again, the same problem. So BC would be 2 cm, which makes DC 0. That's impossible. Therefore, the problem is impossible as stated.

But the user is asking to solve it, which means either there's a mistake in the problem or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the formula is BD = (AB + BC - AC)/2, which would mean BD = (7 + BC -5)/2 = (2 + BC)/2. Given BD = 2, so:

(2 + BC)/2 = 2  2 + BC = 4  BC = 2. Then DC = BC - BD = 2 - 2 = 0. Again impossible.

Therefore, this suggests that the given lengths are impossible. But the problem must have a solution, so perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is BD = s - AC, which would be s - 5. BD is given as 2, so s = 7. Then perimeter is 14, so BC = 14 -7 -5 = 2. Then DC = s - AB = 7 -7 = 0. Same result.

Therefore, the conclusion is that with AB=7, AC=5, and BD=2, the only possible BC is 2, making DC=0, which is impossible. Therefore, no such triangle exists with these measurements. But the problem is presented as solvable, so perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, or I have a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe I confused the points of tangency. Suppose D is the point where the incircle touches AB instead of BC. But the problem states it's on BC.

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem. For example, if BD were 3 cm instead of 2, then BC would be 8, and DC would be 5, which works. But the problem says BD=2.

Alternatively, maybe the sides AB and AC are switched. If AB=5 and AC=7, then BD = s - AC = (5 +7 +BC)/2 -7 = (12 + BC)/2 -7 = (BC -2)/2. Set BD=2: (BC -2)/2=2  BC -2=4  BC=6. Then DC = s - AB = (5+7+6)/2 -5 = 18/2 -5=9-5=4. Then DC=4, which is valid. So perhaps the problem has a typo, switching AB and AC.

But according to the problem, AB=7, AC=5. So unless there's a mistake, the problem as given is impossible. Therefore, the answer is that no such triangle exists. However, since the problem asks to find DC, it's more likely that I made a mistake.

Wait, let's double-check all steps once again.

Given:

AB = 7 cm (side c)

AC = 5 cm (side b)

BD = 2 cm (segment on BC from B to point of tangency D)

We need to find DC.

Using the formula for BD in terms of the semiperimeter:

BD = s - AC = s - 5

Given BD = 2, so s = 7

s = (AB + BC + AC)/2 = (7 + BC +5)/2 = (12 + BC)/2 =7

Multiply both sides by 2:

12 + BC =14  BC=2 cm

Then DC = BC - BD =2 -2=0 cm, which is impossible.

Thus, the problem as stated is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement. However, since the user has presented this problem, perhaps they intended different values or there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to use Heron's formula to find the inradius and then find DC, but that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, let's consider that maybe the triangle is not valid with the given sides. Let's check the triangle inequality. If AB=7, AC=5, and BC=2 (from previous calculation), then:

AB + BC > AC? 7 +2 >5 9>5, yes.

AC + BC > AB?5+2=7>7? No, 7 is not greater than 7. Therefore, the triangle inequality fails. Hence, a triangle with sides 7,5,2 is degenerate. Therefore, it's a straight line, not a valid triangle. Hence, the problem is impossible.

Therefore, the conclusion is that with the given lengths, such a triangle cannot exist, making DC=0 impossible. Hence, there is no solution.

But since the user expects an answer, perhaps I missed something. Let me try a different approach.

Let’s denote the lengths:

Let’s let BD=2, DC=x. Therefore, BC=BD+DC=2+x.

The semiperimeter s=(AB+BC+AC)/2=(7 + (2+x) +5)/2=(14 +x)/2.

Now, the lengths of the tangents are:

BD= s - AC 2= s -5 s=7

But s=(14 +x)/2=7 14 +x=14 x=0. Again, same result. DC=0, impossible.

Therefore, the problem is impossible as stated. Thus, the answer is that no such triangle exists, or there's a mistake in the given values.

However, since the user is asking for a solution, I must consider that perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps the formula for BD is s - b, where b is the side opposite to B, which is AC=5. Yes, that's correct. So BD=s-5=2s=7. Then perimeter=14. AB=7, AC=5, so BC=14-7-5=2. Hence, BC=2, BD=2, so DC=0. Impossible.

Therefore, the problem is impossible. The given lengths lead to a degenerate triangle where C and D coincide, which is not possible in a valid triangle. Hence, there is no solution. However, if we ignore the impossibility and proceed formally, DC=0 cm. But that's not a valid triangle.

Therefore, the answer is that such a triangle cannot exist, and thus DC cannot be determined under standard Euclidean geometry principles.

But perhaps the user expects a different approach. Let me think again.

Suppose we use the formula for the inradius r and area. The area can be expressed as r*s.

But let's try that. The area using Heron's formula would be sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]. But if s=7, and a=2, b=5, c=7, then:

Area= sqrt[7(7-2)(7-5)(7-7)] = sqrt[7*5*2*0] =0. Hence, the area is zero, confirming it's a degenerate triangle.

Thus, the problem as stated has no valid solution.
The problem as stated presents an inconsistency. Let's analyze step by step:

1. **Given**:  
   - \( AB = 7 \, \text{cm} \), \( AC = 5 \, \text{cm} \), \( BD = 2 \, \text{cm} \).  
   - The incircle touches \( BC \) at \( D \).  

2. **Key Formula**:  
   In any triangle, the length from a vertex to the point of tangency of the incircle is:  
   \[
   BD = s - AC, \quad DC = s - AB
   \]  
   where \( s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} \) (semiperimeter).  

3. **Solve for \( s \)**:  
   Substituting \( BD = 2 \) and \( AC = 5 \):  
   \[
   2 = s - 5 \implies s = 7 \, \text{cm}.
   \]  

4. **Find \( BC \)**:  
   Using \( s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} \):  
   \[
   7 = \frac{7 + BC + 5}{2} \implies 14 = 12 + BC \implies BC = 2 \, \text{cm}.
   \]  

5. **Compute \( DC \)**:  
   \[
   DC = s - AB = 7 - 7 = 0 \, \text{cm}.
   \]  

6. **Geometric Impossibility**:  
   \( DC = 0 \, \text{cm} \) implies points \( C \) and \( D \) coincide, making \( BC = BD = 2 \, \text{cm} \). This violates the **triangle inequality**:  
   \[
   AC + BC = 5 + 2 = 7 \, \text{cm} \not\gt AB = 7 \, \text{cm}.
   \]  
   The triangle collapses into a straight line, rendering it degenerate.  

**Conclusion**:  
No valid triangle exists with the given measurements. The conditions lead to a contradiction, and \( DC \) cannot be meaningfully determined under standard Euclidean geometry.
