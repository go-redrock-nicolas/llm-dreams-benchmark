I am dreaming. **A surreal courtroom floats in the void of space, its mahogany benches hovering weightlessly beneath a domed ceiling that reveals the swirling cosmos beyond. The gavel in my hand is carved from blackened meteorite, humming with strange energy, while the jury before me is composed not of people but of specters—translucent figures robed in starlight, their faces shifting like rippling water.**  

The accused is a towering, shadow-cloaked figure whose form drips like ink onto the pristine marble floor, staining it with creeping darkness. Every time I glance at them, their face changes—sometimes a politician I recognize from the news, sometimes a corporate titan, sometimes something far older, something with too many teeth. Surrounding them, masked figures whisper promises and warnings, their words crawling into my ears like insects.  

*"Make the right choice,"* a voice hisses from the void, though I cannot tell who spoke. *"Or it will be your last."*  

Documents materialize before me, but the ink swims and rearranges itself—testimonies erased and rewritten before my eyes. The air hums with static, a pulsing tension as if reality itself is bending to outside wills. A single law book lies open on the bench, but every time I read it, the text shifts from *"Justice must prevail"* to *"You do not matter"* in blotched, trembling letters.  

The room darkens. The jury's starlight dims. A pressure builds in my skull, pounding like war drums. A cold hand—or is it a tendril?—slides onto my shoulder from behind, and I do not dare turn to see what stands there.  

*"Decide,"* the cosmos itself seems to urge. **But the truth is already slipping through my fingers like sand.**
