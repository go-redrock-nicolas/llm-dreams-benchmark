I am dreaming. I stand at the center of a vast, floating amphitheater carved from living crystal—its facets breathing with molten light. Above me, auroras spiral in impossible hues: violet undulating into chartreuse, then flaming orange. The air tastes of ozone and jasmine; each breath tingles on my tongue like stardust. Around the rim of this soaring arena, ten thousand specters of cheering devotees flicker into being and vanish again, as if my heartbeats themselves summon them.

Tonight is the final round of the Grand Arcane Tournament: an all-world contest whose champions have trained since infancy, mastering arts I only discovered in my sleep. My opponents—six masters arrayed on a ring of obsidian pedestals—stand motionless, robed in living ink that ripples with their willpower. They have conjured armies of spectral wolves, fractal kaleidoscopes that fold space, and towering golems of fractured moonlight. Each expert unleashes wave after wave of precise, practiced power—sheets of eldritch flame, razor-sharp dirigible shards, isolation fields that suck the warmth from my bones.

Against them, I possess only the raw, unfiltered spark of imagination. I grip my instrument: a battered lute carved from driftwood and star-forged steel. With trembling hands I pluck a single note, a mournful lullaby my grandmother once hummed. The sound blooms into liquid silver, weaving through the battlefield like a living river. Where the experts’ spells roar, my melody whispers, coaxing the crystal floor to shine, drawing color from the air itself. I pour every heartbeat, every unspoken hope into each chord. The air quivers; swirling motes of light gather into shapes—fiery phoenixes spiraling upward, blossoming into rainbow wings that cut through the shadow armies.

Onlookers gasp as my music unravels the masters’ tight formations. The spectral wolves falter, then transform into petals of living flame that drift gently to the ground. The golems crack like glass, releasing trapped echoes of childhood laughter and starlit wonder. In that moment, the tournament judges—elders draped in robes of dark matter—rise in unison, their silent applause shaking the very sky.

Victory blooms inside me like a supernova. The crystal arena shivers, raining prismatic shards that settle at my feet as a crown. I lift my lute in triumph; my opponents bow their heads in respect. In the wake of my final chord, the amphitheater dissolves into a soft white mist. As I drift upward, cradled by that mist, the last thing I feel is the warm press of moonlight against my skin—then I awaken, the echo of silver strings still humming in my veins.
