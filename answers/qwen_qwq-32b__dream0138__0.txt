I am dreaming. I am leading a rescue mission in the midst of a catastrophic storm. The skies above crack with sheets of lightning, illuminating the labyrinth of half-collapsed skyscrapers and inverted trees, their roots clawing at the heavens. My team—five of us— moves through flooded streets that smell of salt and burnt copper. Emergency radios squawk static between bursts of garbled alerts. We’re heading towards the old hydro-electric dam, where a group of scientists maintains a secret project. The storm has supercharged their quantum-energy core, and it’s about to breach, threatening a chain reaction that could destabilize the entire valley. 

But there’s another concern. A nearby orphanage is flooding, and we received a distress call from a young girl named Lila. She’s trapped with seven others in the attic, their breath fogging the storm’s cold. I have to decide: divert to save the children now, risking the dam’s unmonitored growth—or go to the dam first, leaving the children’s fate to chance. 

The choice is excruciating. My second-in-command, Kael, argues for the dam. “If that core erupts,” he says, his voice tight, “it won’t just take out a city—it’ll rewrite physics as we know it.” Yet the image of Lila’s face, pixelated on my handheld device, haunts me. 

The storm howls. The waters rise. Decisions multiply. Will we split the team? Do we have time? And when we reach the dam, what if we can’t stop it, even then? The weight pulls at my chest, a black hole of responsibility. 

Then, a new complication: the water is rising too quickly. The orphanage will be underwater in 15 minutes. But the dam is ten minutes away, through a flooded underpass. If we go for the dam, we’re almost certain to save 10,000 lives—but the eight children are lost. If we take the orphanage, we save eight, but risk a catastrophe. 

As I debate, I glance at Mira, our medic, who nods once—a silent plea for the children. Kael’s jaw is set, his eyes unyielding. 

The countdown ticks. Thunder shakes the world.
