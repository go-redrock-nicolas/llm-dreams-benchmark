I am dreaming. The dream starts with me floating above a sprawling, labyrinthine city made entirely of glass and mirrors. The buildings twist into impossible geometries, reflecting light in prismatic bursts that cast kaleidoscopic patterns over everything. Beneath me, shadowy figures with distorted faces move in slow motion through streets that shift like liquid mercury. Each time I try to focus on an individual, their form splinters into a dozen mirrored shards, each showing a differentfacet of my own expressions: a sneer here, a pitying glance there, a look of pure disdain twisting someone’s features into a grotesque pantomime of my own inner judgments.

A voice, like wind through crystal, whispers, “Every reflection you fracture becomes another shadow.” Suddenly, a figure crystallizes clearly—a version of myself wearing a masquerade mask carved with hundreds of tiny, watching eyes. They hold out a handmirror whose surface ripples like water. Inside it, I see someone I’ve begrudged for their self-doubt. But instead of the weak, shuffling figure I recall, the mirror shows me standing there, trembling, clutching secrets I’ve never admittedeven to myself. 

The mirrored-self beckons deeper into the city. As I follow, the ground hardens into a bridge of ice that sings with a low, resonant hum. Ahead, a market bazaar unfolds, its stalls manned by silent vendors whose faces are obscured by shifting mosaics of my own facial expressions caught in moments of criticism. They offer wares that defy logic: jars labeled “Projected Blame,” vials emitting smoke that smells like regret, and tapestries woven from the threads of unresolved quarrels.

At the center of the market stands a towering obsidian obelisk. Etched into its sides are scenes from forgotten arguments, each panel showing me judging others while simultaneously accusing an unseen “them” of the same flaw. When I touch the obelisk, it liquefies into a pool that draws me in. Underwater, I see a school of bioluminescent fish—each one a flickering memory of a time I displaced anger or scorn onto another. Chasing them, I grab one, and it dissolves into a vision: my coworker’s promotion I’d envied, which now reveals their sleepless nights struggling to keep up. 

The water swirls, and I’m back at the bridge. The mirrored-self is gone. Now before me is a door of black glass. Behind it, voices murmur in overlapping whispers—slogans of my internal critics now externalized. I push through, landing in an open meadow under a starless sky. The ground is soft moss glowing faintly blue, and in the center grows a tree with bark like cracked porcelain. Its branches cradle millions of origami cranes, each carrying a hidden shame or pride I’ve ever felt. As I reach for one, it unfurls into paper snow, settling to reveal my own face, aged and wiser, cradling a stone that radiates forgiving warmth. 

The dream ends as the tree roots begin to coil around my ankles, whispering in a language of forgotten truths. Awakening, I feel the residue of clarity: the ache of recognizing how often I’ve weaponized other’s flaws to avoid gazing into my own trembling reflection.
