I am dreaming. …step into a collision of colors and sound.

Glittering dust drifts through the air like the lazy fall of snow-made-of-light, settling on the carved roots and woven hammocks that make up this arboreal village. Houses hang from titanic branches of a tree so large its crown hides the moon, its sap glowing a patient blue that illuminates every face. The first person you meet is a tall woman whose skin is the lilac of a storm at dawn; pearl-white scales shimmer along her jaw. Her hair floats as though buoyed by water, and soft chimes jingle from bone bracelets circling her wrists.

She regards you with amber eyes and offers a quiet phrase: “Sa-lú na xélem.” The words vibrate in your chest like distant cello strings, yet hold no meaning you can seize. You respond the only way you can—by mirroring her gentle bow. Your hands spread, palms up, a universal semaphore of harmlessness. Instantly she flashes a smile: sharp, predatory, but approving. 

Between you she places a fruit shaped like a teardrop, skinned in silver velvet. Unsure of the ritual, you extend it back; she shakes her head, laughing, a sound rippling with bells. She taps the fruit twice: once to her collarbone, once to yours. Invitation. You bite. It bursts in a flood of warmth, tasting like sugar, cedar smoke, and the after-rain smell of pavement. When you swallow, the village seems to brighten, as though you have stepped slightly closer to its heart.

She gestures you onward.

You weave together through suspended bridges of braided vine. Below, luminous fish glide through sheer air, fins arrogant and coral-bright; they chirp if anyone passes too close. Children with moss-green eyes chase them, leaping from platform to platform, laughing in sonic bursts that rattle dragonfly wings. Markets bloom on every limb: jars of stardust juggled by jokers with six fingers, ribbons of living silk sold by pigeons large enough to wear riding saddles.

Your guide stops at a forge cored into the bark. A blacksmith—three-armed and haloed in sparks—hammers raw thunder into curved plates. Each strike releases the smell of petrichor and a bass drum of thunder: THOOOMM. He turns, studies you, and without a word sets a dull slate disk in your palm. It looks inert—until it begins to echo your heartbeat with a faint pulsing glow. A promise, a gift, a key? You do not know, but everyone nods as if an unspoken bargain is sealed.

Dusk glides in on silent wings, and the entire village converges at the tree’s navel: a clearing ringed by roots thick as cliffs. Here they erect a bowl carved from night itself—obsidian shimmering with trapped galaxies. One by one villagers press fingertips to foreheads, then to the bowl’s edge, leaving behind droplets of liquid light. Your guide nudges you forward. You mimic. Light beads form floating syllables, drifting up like fireflies: “xah, luma, qiró.” They swirl, cross, braid—until suddenly, midair, the syllables tangle around your head and pour into you as soundless rain.

Meaning ignites.

The lilac woman’s name is Shalú. The thunder-smith is Okkar. The glowing fruit is called “dawn-heart.” And the disk in your hand? It is a Promise Stone: proof you have offered vulnerability and been accepted. The language that felt like rushing water now clicks effortlessly where moments ago it slid away.

“You hear us now,” Shalú says—no longer alien, but intimate, the way a campfire’s crackle feels when night is too dark.

“I do,” you breathe, startled by your own fluency. Gratitude floods you. You face the gathered crowd and speak the only honest thing you have: “Thank you for letting me stay.” Your words rise, hover, then burst into motes that settle on shoulders, hair, leaves. Approval rustles through the branches like windblown applause.

Drums begin—a heartbeat amplified by hollow roots—and dancers spiral outward, painting constellations with scarves woven of captured dusk. Somewhere above, the sky splits into curtains of emerald and violet aurora. You dance too, unsteady, laughing with strangers who are no longer strangers. The disk at your breast thrums in sync with every drumbeat—one pulse, one people.

Hours later, when tiredness folds the village into soft sighs and the tree’s radiant sap dims to ember-red, Shalú presses a woven hammock leaf into your hands. “You have roots here now,” she says. “Sleep, Traveler.”

You nestle into the leaf, rocking high above the dreaming earth. Far below, stardust fish trace lazy spirals. Far above, the moon slips between the branches, curious and silver. You close your eyes. Sap-light shivers across your face like warm rain.

And in that hush—somewhere between foreign and familiar, between the first impossible word and the last thunderclap—you know you will wake, eventually. But not yet. Not until this dream finishes sculpting its final blossom and sets it gently into your open, waiting hand.
