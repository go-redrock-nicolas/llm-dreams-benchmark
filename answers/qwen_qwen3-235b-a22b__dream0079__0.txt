I am dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt lavender and salt, and the sky above is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, shifting and rippling as if alive. Before me looms a mountain—not of stone, but of jagged, translucent glass shards that sing in dissonant harmonies when the wind passes through them. At its peak floats a door, ancient and gnarled, carved with runes that glow like dying stars. The challenge is clear: climb the mountain, open the door, and face whatever lies beyond. But the glass cuts the air itself, slicing my breath into ragged fragments. Every step forward feels like walking into a storm of shattered memories.  

I turn to my community, my voice a thread of smoke in the vastness. They materialize not as people, but as *sensations*, as *elements*—each embodying a truth I’ve forgotten.  

First, the **blind weaver** appears, her fingers dancing with threads of starlight and shadow. She doesn’t speak but hands me a cloak stitched from the silence between midnight and dawn. “Wear this,” her touch says, “and you’ll hear the mountain’s heartbeat beneath its screams.” The fabric clings to me like a second skin, and suddenly the glass’s keening resolves into a rhythm—a pulse that guides my steps, avoiding the sharpest edges.  

Next, the **mute drummer**, his skin etched with maps of forgotten rivers. He beats a cadence on a drum made of his own ribs, each strike sending ripples through the ground. The vibrations teach my bones to *dance* with the mountain’s tremors, turning peril into a waltz. I leap across chasms of falling light, my fear now a partner in the choreography.  

Then comes the **elderly herbalist**, her hair a nest of moss and fireflies. She presses a vial to my lips—liquid moonlight mixed with the nectar of unblooming flowers. “Drink,” her eyes whisper, “and the pain will taste like purpose.” The potion burns, but where the glass draws blood, it seals the wounds with threads of gold, weaving my resolve tighter.  

A child materializes last, face obscured by a mask of shifting seasons. She giggles and tosses me a key carved from a tooth, a baby molar etched with constellations. “The door doesn’t open,” she chimes, “it *unfolds*. You have to become smaller than a whisper, larger than a storm.”  

With the key in hand, I reach the summit—only to find the mountain dissolving beneath me. The glass shards melt into a river of liquid obsidian, surging with serpents of molten silver. The door now floats at the river’s heart, but crossing it requires surrendering the cloak, the drumbeat, the vial’s fire. I let them go, and the river parts not with force, but with a sigh, revealing a bridge of *voices*: my community’s whispers braided into arches of light.  

As I cross, the bridge trembles with their stories—regrets, triumphs, lullabies, wars—all the fragments I’d dismissed as “not mine.” The door unfolds, not inward, but *outward*, spilling a flood of dawns across the horizon. Beyond it lies not a revelation, but a mirror. And in it, I am the mountain, the river, the key.  

I wake with the taste of starlight on my tongue and the ache of a thousand forgotten songs in my ribs. The dream lingers, not as a riddle, but as a compass: the greatest challenges are not conquered, but *conversed* with—and the voices we carry are never truly silent.
