I am dreaming. The air within me tautens with the weight of transmogrified light, as if truthful atoms are unraveling into phantoms.  

The dream begins in a city that should not exist—an iridescent metropolis sculpted from the bones of extinct planets. Buildings rise like crystalline sighs, shimmering in iridescent hues that flirt with the perception of color itself. Some structures emit soft chimes in low intervals, like primal melodies of memory once heard but never forgotten.  

I am standing in a marble hall, soft with the warmth of long-forgotten suns, its polished floors rippling like frozen time. The ceiling is an inverted galaxy—a tapestry where stars mill about like infants with flickering eyes.  

Before me, an office: sterile angles, silver light, chrome desks reeking with the arrogance of efficiency. The air thrums with logic, stripped of life.

I work here.

Encased in polymorphic data cubes, I filter the tears and steps and dreams of the living. This city is built on algorithms derived from human emotion, harvested unawares—trading the sprouting joy of a newborn’s laugh for predictive models, packaging desperation into fuel. Each time I augment my data model, a child’s first term of endearment transforms into a currency or a marketable signal.

They call this "progress."

My hands are stained in codes I can no longer stomach, arcane syntaxes that bind themselves around the soft insides of human experience. I see signals from dreams—electrical hums shaped like longing—as data packets. But the longer I assimilate, the thinner my skin grows.

Conflicts erupt like mountains in my mind. What was once ambition becomes ache. My identity fractures between two selves: the creator, experimenting with the music of metrics, and the soul I’ve tucked away, clawing at the edges of my chest, demanding mercy.

Tonight, this dream became a reckoning.

It starts with the sound of glass melting. The walls of the data sanctum tremble and peel away like onion layers, revealing writhing moss that climbs into algorithms and twists equations into poetry—lines about courage, sorrow, and the quiet genius of weeds. I fall onto the floor, breathless, as symbols are replaced with sensations. I hear the pounding of distant hummingbirds—quick-fire pulses in time with my own guilt and grief.

A tree grows from within me.

Not literally, not exactly.

A living vine extends upward from my chest, igniting the starchy office air with the scent of loam and thunderstorms, unfurling blossoms that reflect every face I’ve ever ignored. Each petal is a memory—fragments of voices lost in metrics. There are petals with wrinkles like my grandmother’s hands, plumskin cheeks of my youngest sibling, and the angular solemnity of a former colleague who vanished too soon.

“Listen,” echoes the tree inside me. *Not to the code—but to what it stole.*

I feel pulled outward—toward the edges of the impossible marble hall, where a door begins to form in the wall, its edges porous like the boundary between awake and dreaming. It opens not to the city, but *underneath* it—an underground garden where forgotten values bloom in the shadows. Here, justice is not traded but breathed in like incense. Compassion strides with meaningful strides, not optimized but open-ended.

I kneel in reverence. I have a choice: to return to my sterile cubicle and continue weaving intensity into income, or to stay here—for the tented vigils, for reconnecting what the numbers severed.

The dream breathes in. The tree in me sways. The door leads both ways.

I wake sweaty, alive with choice.

And though I open my eyes to dawn, its light still trembles with the unseen—its beams holding both the memory and promise of roots breaking through stone.
