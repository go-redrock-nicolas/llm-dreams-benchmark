I am dreaming. …blink awake inside a place that feels like the inside of a planet-sized snow globe, except the “snow” is made of constellations: flecks of starlight that float, pause, then swirl again in slow-motion eddies. A glassy dome, miles high, curves overhead, but the horizon is lost to a violet haze that ripples like the surface of a giant amethyst. Somewhere far above, a hidden sun pulses once every few heartbeats, casting waves of color that wash the world in successive hues—saffron, cobalt, rose, jade—each pulse changing the scent of the air and the taste of my breath.

I remember, with a jolt that feels like lightning braided with nostalgia, that this is the Arena of All Tomorrows—the place every child in my city dreams of reaching and few ever do. The final trial: win, and a door opens onto any future I can imagine; falter, and I awaken to an ordinary life, the memory of possibility fading like fog from a mirror. Years of study, sparring, night-long vigils, and miles of endurance training have funneled to this single moment.

A hush ripples through the galaxies of spectators, each star in the stands a person, each comet tail a gasp. The air trembles and rearranges itself into a staircase made of overlapping music notes—literal sheets of sonorous parchment that resonate underfoot. I climb, my boots striking chords: C minor, E major, suspended seventh—each vibration unlocking another wedge of memory, sharpening my focus until the world seems composed of facets of meaning.

At the top of the staircase hovers the final challenge: a disk of living crystal the size of a lake, spinning silently, its surface etched with a spiral of icons—glyphs I’ve studied but never seen in motion. They flash: flame, river, feather, clock, mirror, seed, storm, sun. My pulse syncs with their rhythm, and suddenly I understand. To win, I must shape a single act that unites every symbol without breaking the spiral’s symmetry. The test is part riddle, part art, part impossible physics.

A gong made of pure thought reverberates—a vibration felt in bone more than heard—and the countdown begins. Ninety heartbeat-beats to solve the eternal puzzle.

Flame: I summon a ribbon of fire from my palm, but instead of heat it radiates memory—my first triumph, my grandmother’s laughter, the stinging thrill of my first failure.

River: I guide the ribbon downward, transforming it into liquid, a glowing stream that circles my ankles and spins outward in gentle spirals like a cosmic yo-yo.

Feather: I whisper a wind, and the river evaporates into an iridescent mist, feathers of vapor riding invisible updrafts, drifting toward the outer edge of the spinning disk.

Clock: Time fractures into translucent gears above me. I pluck them, rearrange their teeth, slow the rotation of the disk so that each symbol lingers just long enough to feel my intention.

Mirror: I tilt one of the gears and it becomes a silvered surface. In it I see my own eyes, but inside them blaze the eyes of every mentor who ever guided me—lending courage, lending precision.

Seed: From the mirror’s depths I draw a tiny, dark kernel of possibility. It hums with dormant universes. I plant it at the center of the disk. Crack. Sprout. A luminous tree blossoms in the span of a sigh, its branches forming new concentric spirals that intertwine with the original glyph-spiral without disrupting it.

Storm: The branches conjure clouds. Thunder rumbles like a drumline. I raise my arms, conduct the downpour so each raindrop lands in cadence with my heartbeat, tracing pathways along the spiral—fire-borne memory, river-wind, feather-light promise—electric veins knitting everything together.

Sun: The hidden orb overhead flares, the pulses quicken, and a spear of white-gold light lances down through trunk, branches, spiral, disk, and me. For an instant I am both incandescent and transparent, skeleton made of lightning, heart a supernova.

The disk stops spinning. Silence crashes over the arena. The glowing tree retracts into a single seed once more and drops into my waiting hand, warm as dawn. Every symbol glows in harmony, flawlessly linked, the spiral unbroken.

Then—the quiet splits open like silk. A roar rises from the stellar audience, a chorus of nebulae singing victory. The dome fractures into petals of glass that float upward and melt into star-foam. A door appears where the horizon once was: a simple wooden threshold set into nothingness, its frame carved with the glyphs I’ve just united.

I step toward it. With each footfall, scenes of futures bloom around me like holograms drawn in smoke: me piloting aerial libraries across desert skies; me teaching children to converse with whales made of code; me cultivating symphonies in zero gravity gardens. Each possibility sweeps by like a shuffled deck, inviting, dazzling.

Hand on the doorknob, I look back once, see the Arena fading into twilight, constellations folding their applause, mentors’ faces dissolving into moonlight. I inhale a breath that tastes of rain-cooled iron and orchard blossom. When I release it, the door swings open—

—and I wake, palm still closed around something warm. I uncurl my fingers. There, on my bedsheet, lies a tiny dark seed that hums with dormant universes, reminding me that sometimes a dream is not merely a story our minds tell but a rehearsal for the moment we dare to claim our own impossible future.
