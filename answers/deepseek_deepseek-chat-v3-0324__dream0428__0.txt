I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Gilded Storm**  

You are standing in a city of glass and gold, where the sky is perpetually caught between sunset and twilight—streaks of molten amber bleeding into deep violet. Towers rise like crystalline spines, reflecting the fractured light, yet your chest hums with an unshakable unease. The air smells of petrichor and burnt sugar, both comforting and unsettling.  

Beneath your feet, the pavement thrums like a living thing. Each step sends ripples through the ground, turning the polished streets into liquid mirrors. Passersby float past you—their faces flicker between familiar and abstract, like half-remembered portraits. They whisper without speaking, their words not words but sensations: a brush of warmth against your cheek, a cold finger down your spine.  

*This is too perfect,* you think. *Too easy.*  

And then the sky cracks.  

From the horizon, something massive unspools—a storm of ink and static, swallowing the gilded towers whole. Lightning does not strike; it *creeps*, crawling in jagged reverse up toward the clouds. The wind carries laughter, yours and not yours.  

A voice, sticky as honey, coils around your thoughts: *"You knew it couldn't last."*  

But then—something shifts. The terror has edges now. You can *hold* it. The moment you do, the storm hesitates. The darkness recoils as if burned. The glass city reassembles itself, but differently this time. The gold is now living ivy, braided through the streets. The mirrors show not your reflection, but glimpses of other selves—versions of you laughing, resting, unafraid.  

The voice returns, softer. *"Or maybe it can."*  

You wake with your fingers curled around nothing, but the scent of blooming iron and citrus lingers in the air. The dreamsticks like a promise. *Like a dare.*
