I am dreaming. I blink, and the world that opens around me is nothing like the waking one I left behind. A hush, as if I have fallen between heartbeats, hovers in the air. 

I am standing barefoot on the polished floor of a railway station fashioned entirely from translucent crystal. Every surface glows from within—amber pulsing beneath my feet, emerald streaks washing over the tall arches that soar overhead. When I breathe, the crystal responds, blooming with ripples of light that echo my exhalations. Familiar routines—keys, phone, train ticket—dissolve from my memory as surely as dawn scatters stars. All I have is my pulse, my curiosity, and a grand sense of having arrived somewhere far stranger than any map.

A train slides into the station without making a sound. It is composed of pages—thin parchment sheets layered and folded into the shape of carriages. Ink flows across them like living vines: musical scores, forgotten letters, mathematical formulas, and childhood doodles jostle for space. Doors unfurl from the edges as though the pages have decided to open themselves just for me. I step in, and the floor softens underfoot, yielding like moss.

Inside, seats are hovering lanterns of colored glass, swaying gently in rhythm with a locomotive beat that I feel instead of hear. I choose a lantern the color of twilight—indigo shot through with flashes of silver—and settle onto its warm glow. The train begins to move, but the station stays where it is; instead, the scenery peels away. Walls flow past like curtains drawn aside. Crystal station, city, earth—all dissolve layer after layer until only endless midnight sky surrounds us, spangled with constellations that rearrange themselves each instant. Orion winks, scrambles his belt across the heavens, and becomes a set of dragon wings. Ursa Major twists into a key, then a door, then dissolves into glitter.

A conductor approaches me. She is made of shards of mirror, each fragment reflecting a different face I have worn throughout my life: toddler covered in birthday cake frosting; anxious teenager gripping a diploma; resigned commuter staring out a bus window at morning drizzle; elder whose eyes I have yet to grow into. When she speaks, twenty versions of my voice answer in chorus: “Ticket, please.” 

I fumble for something to offer, but pockets are suddenly stitched shut. Panic rises—how do you pay a fare in a place where money, memory, and language keep morphing? The conductor leans closer until I can see stars whirl in the facets of her jaw. “You’ve already paid,” the mirrors say. “You paid with every chance you never took, and now we’re cashing in.” Before I can reply, she dissolves into scattered shards that ring like wind chimes and drift down the aisle, reforming into doorways behind me. 

Our first stop is announced on an overhead scroll that writes itself in real time: “Station of Unspoken Words.” The parchment carriage rips open a window, and I step out onto an island floating above a sea of quiet. At my feet lie small polished stones, each glowing faintly. I pick one up. The instant I touch it, a sentence I never voiced in waking life rings out—“I forgive you, even though you never apologized.” It flies free, morphs into a pearl-colored bird, and joins a flock circling overhead. The sky carries thousands of such birds, each born from the tongues that could not or would not speak. Wind rustles with collective sighs of relief. I realize my mouth feels weightless.

The train calls me back with a long sigh, pages flapping impatiently, so I board once more. Now the sky has turned the color of ripe apricots. A scent of petrichor and old library dust mingles in the air. Lightning scribbles quicksilver signatures along the horizon. My lantern seat dims, then brightens again, pulsing to the beat of an unseen heart.

Next stop: “Market of Missing Echoes.” Picture a bazaar where vendors hawk intangible wares—snippets of forgotten laughter, half-remembered lullabies, the flavor of grandmother’s soup once tasted in childhood. I trade a memory of a lukewarm Tuesday office meeting (worth nothing to me now) for a single echo of thunder that used to terrify me as a child. When I cup it in my hands, it rolls like distant drums and vibrates through my bones, reminding me that fear can be thrilling when no harm will follow. I place the echo against my chest and let it seep in, rewriting tension into exhilaration.

Back on the parchment train, the ink has begun to melt, dripping down in dark tears. The carriages buckle, pages curling like leaves kissed by flame. We are heading, it seems, toward the Terminal Station—an edge-of-everything precipice where waking and dreaming collide. The sky funnels into a single, dizzying point of white light. I clutch the lantern, but it shatters into a cascade of fireflies that spin around me, illuminating the cabin in strobing pulses.  

For a moment, all sensations fall away—no sound, no gravity, no heat or cold. I can’t even remember what shape I am supposed to occupy. Then, a whisper: “Jump.” It’s my voice, yet deeper, as though filtered through centuries. There is no doorway, only a thin membrane of light that quivers like soap film at the end of the carriage. Without preparation, without plan, I leap.

I pass through something softer than silk yet sharper than ice. On the other side, I land gently in a violet meadow under a turquoise dusk. The wind bends knee-high grasses that glow faintly from within, creating swirling patterns like bioluminescent waves. Above, two moons chase each other in slow, deliberate orbits, casting onion-skin shadows that overlap and slide apart. Fireflies that once were lantern shards drift upward, arranging themselves into words:  “Now you know.”

Do I? Perhaps what I know most is the richness of not knowing—of surrendering to a reality that reinvents itself moment by moment. My routines, my schedules, my tidy linear narrative—burned away like scrap paper in a bonfire. In their place: raw possibilities, shimmering like dew on alien petals.

I kneel, touch the ground, and it hums a chord that resonates with my pulse. Color climbs up my arms in bands—indigo first, then crimson, then a fierce burnished gold. The two moons swell in unison, filling the sky until they fuse into a blazing corona. Light floods everything. Grass becomes crystal, crystal becomes sea, sea becomes nothing but bright vibration.

And somewhere in that flood of luminescence, a familiar alarm tone begins to chime—slowly rising through the frequencies until it morphs into my morning ringtone. The meadow wavers. The moons wobble like soap bubbles about to burst. I realize the dream’s gravity is loosening its hold.

But before the worlds fall away, the conductor reappears—once again prismatic, fractured, reflecting infinite me’s. In her mirror-throat, I glimpse my waking face, eyes still closed on a pillow. “Take it,” she says, offering a single fragment shaped like a train ticket. The surface bears one line of text: KEEP THE UNEXPECTED.

I clasp it against my chest. The horizon folds shut like a book, the page-carriage curls, the crystal station flickers. A gush of warm daylight pours across my eyelids—

—and I wake, heart racing, hand clenched around nothing. Yet I swear I smell distant thunder and new rain on crystal rails, and tucked inside my memory is the shimmering after-image of a ticket that admits me, forever, to places with no maps.
