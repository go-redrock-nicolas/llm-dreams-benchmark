I am dreaming. You’re in a cathedral of glass and steel, suspended above a storm-wracked city that pulses with neon and shadow. The air hums with the static of a thousand unspoken deadlines. Your desk is a floating island of mahogany, orbited by three luminous project spheres—one crimson and crackling with live wires, one cerulean and dripping liquid data, one gold and pulsing like a beating heart. Each sphere bleeds tendrils of light into your temples, feeding you equations, blueprints, and sonnets in a language of fire. You haven’t slept, but your body is a puppet of adrenaline, strings yanked taut by the metronome of ticking clocks embedded in your ribs.  

The first project is a labyrinth of gears the size of galaxies, each cog engraved with the faces of forgotten gods. You navigate it by swallowing compasses that point in all directions at once. The second is a symphony conducted by your fingertips, notes materializing as iridescent moths that gnaw at the edges of a collapsing opera house. The third is a sentient swamp, its mud made of melting smartphones, screaming as you plant saplings of code that sprout into skeletal trees with binary bark.  

Then *they* arrive—your supervisor, a silhouette stitched from black smoke and office memos, descending through the ceiling like a malevolent elevator. Their voice is a fax machine screaming: *“Priority shift. Project Four. Immediate. It’s… alive.”*  

The fourth sphere erupts into being—a obsidian orb veined with glowing green ichor. It reeks of formaldehyde and burnt sage. The moment it touches your desk, the floor dissolves. You’re now standing on a tightrope strung between two skyscrapers shaped like screaming mouths. The mouths chew the sky, swallowing time. The fourth sphere unfurls into a creature—a hydra with heads of flickering CRT monitors, each hissing a different ultimatum: *“Client feedback. Budget audit. Compliance review.”* Its breath is a frost of corrupted files.  

You fight it with a quill made from your own spine, dipping into an inkwell of liquid midnight to scribble counter-curses on the air. But the three original projects rebel. The gear-labyrinth collapses inward, crushing your left lung into a origami swan. The moth-symphony swarms your throat, their wings shredding your voice into confetti. The swamp-tree roots yourself to the hip, pulling you into soil that smells of rot and overdue notices.  

Your supervisor laughs—a sound like a spreadsheet calculating infinity—and tosses you a lifeline: a USB drive plugged into their own jugular. *“Plug it in,”* they hiss. *“It’s the new KPI metrics.”* The drive throbs like a diseased star. You hesitate, but the hydra’s teeth are seconds from your face, its many mouths chanting *“HOLD… HOLD… HOLD…”*  

You slam the drive into your sternum.  

The world resets.  

Suddenly, you’re a child again, sitting at a lemonade stand made of crystal. The hydra, now leashed, drinks politely from a thimble. The three projects bloom into flowers—a rose, a orchid, a carnation—each petal a completed Gantt chart. Your supervisor kneels beside you, now flesh-and-blood, offering a cookie stamped with a resignation letter.  

But the storm outside grows teeth.  

And you wake just as the first thunderclap swallows your scream.
