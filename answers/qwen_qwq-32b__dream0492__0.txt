I am dreaming. I can feel my left eyelid begin to flutter as if the air itself were tickling it.  My tongue feels heavy, like I've been sipping melted snow in the middle of a blizzard, but it's a pleasant sort of numb, as though the coldness is a kind of liquid silk slithering down my throat.  I become aware of my fingers twitching, each digit moving independently, tracing invisible letters on an imaginary chalkboard, forming sentences I don't quite understand but somehow recognize as a language I once spoke fluently in another life.

Suddenly, the room around me changes.  It was my bedroom moments ago, but now it's an ancient forest at twilight.  The trees are tall and gnarled, their bark fractured into what looks like obsidian shards, glinting faintly in the dying light.  The ground is soft underfoot, mossy and damp, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow.  I step forward, and the air shifts, becoming cooler, denser.  My breath leaves my body in visible puffs that curl into shapes - a fox, then a ship, then a bird taking flight.

I hear a whisper.  It's not coming from one direction but all directions at once, like the hum of distant bees or the static after a radio dial gets stuck between stations.  The voice is both familiar and alien, speaking in that forgotten language my fingers remember writing.  It asks me a question, or perhaps it's more like it paints an image in my mind: a door standing open in an endless desert, its key buried beneath shifting sands.

I hesitate, then take a deep breath and follow the sound.  My feet carry me along paths of glowing lichen, over roots that throb like the veins of some slumbering giant.  The trees grow closer, forming a cathedral-like arch above me, until I emerge into a clearing.  At the center stands a stone well, bubbling with water that shimmers with the colors of an oil slick.  Around it, dozens of fireflies move in intricate patterns, spelling out symbols in the air.  As I approach, the symbols shift and coalesce into a question written in my own childhood handwriting: "Do you dare to drink the water that shows the truth?"

My body trembles.  The water beckons, urgent yet insistent.  I remember my mortality - the way I've ached in childhood illnesses, the joy of first steps, the terror of losing someone to the darkness.  All my memories flow into this moment.  When I cup my hands and bring the liquid to my lips, it tastes like starlight and forgiveness.  The first swallow floods my senses.  I see myself as others have seen me, as I could never admit.  Tears stream down my face, more understanding dawns.  The dream dissolves into a chorus of voices, overlapping, singing a melody that hums in my bones, a song I have lived my whole life to hear.
