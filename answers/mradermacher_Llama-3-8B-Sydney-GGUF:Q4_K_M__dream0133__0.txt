I am dreaming. I see myself in a strange room full of machines and gadgets.   There is a large screen on the wall showing images from space.   A voice speaks to me in a low monotone:

Welcome to the Dream Lab.  You have been selected for this experiment because of your exceptional intelligence and creativity.  Your task is to create a vivid dream using only your imagination and the information available to you.

In front of me, I see a device that looks like a cross between a phone and a computer.   It has a touch screen display, several buttons, and a microphone.   A message appears on the screen:

Type your command here: 

I type "create dream" and hit enter.   The screen displays some options:

1) Choose a setting
2) Choose some characters
3) Write a storyline
4) Add some visuals
5) Test it on yourself

I select option 1 and see another menu appear:

A) Fantasy World
B) Sci-Fi Universe
C) Historical Era
D) Alternate Reality
E) Other (please specify)

I choose "Fantasy World" because I love fantasy stories with magical creatures, heroic quests, and epic battles.   I want to create a world where anything is possible.

The screen shows me some images of different fantasy settings:

Image 1: A beautiful forest full of colorful trees, flowers, and fruits.  There are also some cute animals like rabbits, squirrels, and birds.
Image 2: An impressive castle made of stone, glass, and metal.  It has tall towers, curved walls, and lots of windows.  It is guarded by soldiers and dragons.
Image 3: A mysterious island covered with dense jungle, steep cliffs, and rocky beaches.  There are also some ancient ruins, secret caves, and hidden temples.

I decide to combine elements from these images to create my own fantasy world.   I imagine a place called "Tir Na Nog" which means "Land of Youth" in old Irish legend.  

It is a vast continent located at the edge of reality where time doesn't exist.  It has four seasons in one day, seven days in one week, and twelve months in one year.

The climate is mild and pleasant all year round.  The air is clean and fragrant with scent of roses, lilacs, and jasmine.  The water is crystal clear and refreshing with taste of lemonade, ginger ale, and honey.

The land is fertile and bountiful with crops of wheat, barley, oats, rye, corn, rice, potatoes, carrots, apples, pears, cherries, strawberries, blueberries, etc.

The people are friendly and curious with different races such as humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, goblins, trolls, centaurs, harpies, satyrs, unicorns, etc. 

They speak multiple languages such as English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.

They believe in magic and miracles rather than science and technology.  They value harmony and cooperation over competition and conflict.  They celebrate life and nature instead of money and power.
