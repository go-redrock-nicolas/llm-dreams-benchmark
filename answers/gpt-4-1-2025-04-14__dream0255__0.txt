I am dreaming. I am drifting within a dreamscape that feels at once familiar and slippery—unfolding under a twilight sky that glimmers with unspoken memories. Within this dream, I recognize my companion by their laughter—a burst of bright sound, glassy and perfect on the surface, yet echoing in a way that hints of a hollow space inside.

We walk together along the shore of a silver-colored lake, its surface mirroring not the sky above, but some secret world beneath—ripples conjured by our words and silences. I sense that shadows skim just beneath their smile, quiet feelings pressing against invisible walls beneath their cheerful mask. They offer anecdotes, sunshine-bright and carefully shaped, but their eyes dart away, reflecting a kind of weather I know too well—one not spoken aloud.

I do not pry. The air is thick with lavender and the hush of unasked questions. Respecting the boundaries of their private sorrows, I weave warm comfort into my presence, letting my gestures speak more than words might dare. I listen fully, nodding, leaning in just enough to signal that space and time are theirs to claim, should they wish.

Between stories, I let the silence stretch, not an emptiness but a soft, open field. I shift the conversation gently, painting with empathy—"It must be hard to always carry the light," I muse aloud, looking out across the luminous water. "Sometimes I think even the lake wishes for a cloud to pass by, just so it can rest a moment out of the sun."

I offer a small, understanding smile, eyes steady and kind. My hand hovers near theirs—never encroaching, simply reassuring in its nearness. I want them to feel the invitation: that here, beneath the starlit hush of this world, vulnerability would be welcomed, never imposed.

Feeling the atmosphere change—a subtle uncoiling, a sigh too gentle to hear—I know I have met their hidden sea with patience and care. In this dream, empathy becomes a candle: steady, unwavering, standing ready for them to seek its glow whenever they're ready. Until then, I let our steps align in quiet companionship, and let the mystery of their heart remain safe, respected, and held in the gentle cupped hands of understanding.
