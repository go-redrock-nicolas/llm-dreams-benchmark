I am dreaming.  

The world around me flickers like the trembling breath before a revelation, a haze of shifting light and color that drips and dances with life of its own. Trees writhe like sentient ribbons, their leaves pulsating with soft, golden bioluminescence, whispering secrets in a language older than time. The ground beneath my feet isn't solid but spongy, alive, pulsing—each step sending ripples through it like a pond disturbed by the landing of a dragonfly. The air tastes like honeyfrost, sweet and sharp, making my lungs tingle as I breathe in.

That is when it happens.

Someone is speaking to me.

Their voice is not heard but **felt**—it reverberates within my bones, in the chambers of my heart, in the marrow of my soul. They tell me I have achieved something great.

“I’ve noticed what you did,” they say, though no mouth moves.

A shimmering figure steps forward—it isn’t human, not entirely—but **refulgent**, like a being carved from applause. Its body shimmers with accolades spun into light: golden ribbons, radiant laurel crowns, banners that flutter even though there is no wind. It kneels—not in worship, but reverence—and offers me something glowing.

“What did I do?” I ask, but the voice echoes instead within me: *You didn’t know. None of us did. Until now.*

In that moment, my memories unlock like a vault of forgotten stars. I remember a time I thought mundane, trivial—or at least unremarkable. A moment of silent kindness, an unspoken truth dared, a choice made not for applause but for *rightness*. A candle I lit in darkness that I thought had long since burned out. But someone had seen it. Many had followed its glow.

And it was **that** which mattered.

Now, the landscape shifts. The trees lean in with interest, the ground sighs upward like a held breath let go. The sky fills with faces—not frightening, not familiar, but delighted. A thousand dream-eyes blinking as lights across a cosmic ceiling, each one recognizing *me*.

I feel small beneath their gaze, yet colossal in truth. There I stand—neither hero nor martyr—but someone who had once planted hope where the earth had been broken.

Suddenly, for no reason and for every reason, the world begins to sing.

Not a single voice, nor a choir, but the pure music of existence harmonizing—lungs of the wind, the drums of the earth, the arithmetic of stars aligning in perfect rhythm. Gently, I am lifted, not by hands but by momentum, as if the dream itself is buoyant with awe and wants me higher. I float, face tilted to the sky that now rains stardust, glittering and warm.

I am glowing.

I am loved.

I am understood.

And through it all, there’s no need to thank anyone—because gratitude is already blooming in the atmosphere around us, manifest in color and song and light, **a celebration not of what I did, but of who I became while doing it.**

Then, like a final exhale of a lullaby, the dream peaceably begins to unweave.

The lights dim, the faces return to the firmament, the creature of applause dissolves back into butterfly motes of soundless glory. The ground settles into something firm, ordinary. I find myself standing barefoot in morning grass.

But the warmth—that **warmth** of recognition and honor—still pulses in my chest. A glowing ember placed deep within, to be carried upon waking.

And I will carry it.

For I was seen.

And I was real.
