I am dreaming. The sky above is a swirling vortex of indigo and amethyst, with stars that twinkle like diamonds scattered across the fabric of the universe. The air is alive with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers, their delicate petals swaying gently in the breeze like ballerinas dancing on the wind. I feel weightless, as if my very essence is floating on the gentle currents of a serene lake.

As I awaken to the dream, I find myself standing in a lush, vibrant forest, surrounded by towering trees that stretch towards the heavens like Giant pillars of ancient wisdom. Their trunks are adorned with glistening, iridescent shells that shimmer and glow with a soft, ethereal light. The soft rustle of leaves and the melodic chirping of birds fill the air, creating a symphony of serenity.

I begin to wander through this mystical forest, my feet bare and my skin sensitive to the intricate patterns of intricate capillaries that crisscross the earth. Every step feels like a journey into the soul, revealing hidden truths and buried memories that have been dormant for far too long.

As I walk, I become aware of a presence lurking at the edges of my perception – a lingering sense of bitterness and resentment that has taken up residence within my heart. It's a presence that refuses to be acknowledged, but its presence is undeniable, a shadowy weight that threatens to suffocate the light and joy that surrounds me.

I come to a clearing, where a magnificent crystal fountain stands, its columns radiating crystal clear water that flows like liquid honey towards the center of the fountain. The air around the fountain is alive with a pulsating energy, as if the water itself is imbued with the vibrations of forgiveness and release.

As I approach the fountain, the emotions I have been carrying begin to rise to the surface, swirling like churning waves in the depths of the water. I place my hands in the water, feeling the cool liquid envelop my palms, and begin to allow the memories of the past to emerge.

Tears flow like rain, as I confront the pain and hurt that have been lingering for so long. The water rises to meet me, carrying with it the embodied memories, emotions, and experiences of my past. I feel the weight of the pain begin to lift, like a ship shedding its anchor, its burden floating away on the waves.

As I stand there, a warmth spreads through my body, a golden light that dissolves all fears, anxieties, and doubts. I feel my heart, once heavy with resentment, begin to expand, filling with the resilience and strength of a newborn flower. My spirit begins to soar, like a lark bursting forth from a prison of shadows, singing a triumphant melody that spreads across the landscape like a banner of hope.

Forgiveness flows through me, like a river refreshed by the fewest appearances, washing away the last remnants of pain and bitterness. I come to understand that the wound is not the wound – but rather a pathway to transcendence, a journey of self-discovery that has taught me to see the beauty in every leaf, the rhythm of every heartbeat, and the symmetry of a symphony of heartbreaking songs.

As I stand before the crystal fountain, surrounded by this abyss of majestic wonder, I feel the euphoria of a weightlessness wash over me, returning to the morning after a hazy spring wedding rehearsal – only this time, it's morning without a ended tattoo that acknowledges some final laughter striking between blows.
