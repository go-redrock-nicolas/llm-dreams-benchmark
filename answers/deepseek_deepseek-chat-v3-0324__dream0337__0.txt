I am dreaming. The air around me hums with a language thick as honey, each word rolling off tongues in a melody I cannot decipher. My surroundings are awash with vibrant colors—buildings painted in hues of saffron and turquoise, splashed with patterns so intricate they seem to breathe. The streets teem with people cloaked in shimmering fabrics that ripple like water, their gestures grand and expressive, as if every conversation were a dance.

A woman with silver streaking her dark hair catches my eye. She tilts her head, her hands rising in a graceful arc, fingers fluttering like leaves catching the wind. I don’t understand her words, but her smile is a bridge. I point to a stall where spices bloom in mountains of gold and crimson, their scented heat curling in the air. She nods, her laughter bright as bells, and mimics grinding something between her palms, then wafts the invisible scent toward me—an invitation to taste. 

A child tugs my sleeve, his eyes alight with mischief. He cups his hands and blows, pretending something magical escapes them. When I mimic him, he grins and pulls me toward a courtyard where elders sit weaving stories from nothing but the sway of their hands and the silence between gestures. One tells of a great bird with wings that blot out the sun, fingers arcing like feathers casting shadows. Without words, I feel its power shake the earth as it takes flight. 

Every interaction becomes a riddle, a puzzle solved through the tilt of a chin, the press of palms together, the shared widening of eyes when the moon rises—a luminous pearl cradled in the indigo silk of the sky. Here, language is not lost; it is reinvented in the flicker of fingertips, in the way strangers become collaborators in the silent poetry of movement. 

And then, just as the dream deepens—I wake, my hands still half-formed into the shape of a story I can no longer remember.
