I am dreaming. I'm standing at the central hub of Mercy General Hospital, the gleaming command center from which I've directed operations for five years. But tonight, everything is different. The normally pristine white corridors pulse with an eerie red emergency lighting. The digital tracking board that normally displays patient locations and statuses is flickering wildly with dozens of incoming cases, each notification bringing a sharp electronic chirp that cuts through the chaos.

"Dr. Rivera, three more ambulances just radioed in—ETA four minutes," says my head nurse, Sofia. Her usually immaculate uniform is splattered with something dark, and there's a wildness in her eyes I've never seen before.

Outside, a strange purple storm rages, lightning that doesn't look quite right—too angular, too persistent—illuminating the parking lot where staff members are converting every available space into triage zones. The rain falls upward sometimes, defying gravity, as though the natural world itself is malfunctioning.

I check our supply system tablet—morphine: critically low; antibiotics: depleted; blood supplies: catastrophic shortage. Yet the numbers don't stay fixed; they swim before my eyes, sometimes improving momentarily before plunging lower than before.

"The east wing just lost power completely," a voice says from somewhere behind me. "And patients from the Westbrook collapse are being diverted here instead of County."

I move through corridors that seem to stretch and contract. A room I just left is somehow three floors away now. A patient I was certain was recovering is suddenly critical. In one room, I find medical equipment I've never seen before—glowing blue instruments that seem to anticipate my thoughts.

The strangest part: every patient has the same face—my own—but with subtle differences. Some have scars I don't possess, others have different colored eyes, as though they're alternate versions of me from paths not taken.

As I reach for my pager, my hand passes through it like smoke. I realize I can no longer remember how I got to work today, or what day it even is. The hospital blueprint in my mind keeps shifting, adding impossible spaces and doors that lead to memories instead of rooms.

And still, they keep coming. Still, I must decide who receives our dwindling resources. Still, I must lead.
