I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the middle of a city unlike anything I've ever seen before. The air hums with an unfamiliar energy, carrying the scent of spices I can't name and the sound of a language that flows like water over smooth stones. The buildings rise in intricate spirals, their walls adorned with glowing runes that pulse softly in hues of indigo and gold. 

The people around me move with a graceful, deliberate pace, their elongated limbs wrapped in flowing garments that seem to change color with their emotions. Some nod to me as they pass, pressing their palms together in front of their third eye—a gesture I instinctively mirror, though I don’t yet know its meaning. 

A trio of children with luminous, star-flecked skin giggle as they dart past, their laughter like wind chimes. One stops to place a small, iridescent fruit in my hand, whispering words that feel warm even if I don’t understand them. I bow slightly, hoping the gratitude in my eyes translates. 

Nearby, a marketplace unfolds like a living tapestry—vendors trade not with coins, but with stories spun from colored mist, bargaining in a dance of gestures and harmonic tones. I watch as a woman gifts a bundle of silver leaves to an elder, who responds by singing a haunting melody that makes the air shimmer. 

I realize then that I’m not just an outsider here—I’m a thread being woven into something vast and beautiful. My mistakes will be part of the pattern, and that’s alright. The dream hums with possibility, inviting me to listen, to move slowly, to learn the rhythm of this world with an open heart.  

And so I step forward, letting the unknown guide me.
