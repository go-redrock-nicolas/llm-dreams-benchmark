I am dreaming. I am in a world where my imagination can run wild and free.  I see colors and shapes that do not exist in reality.
I hear sounds that only my ears can understand.  I feel emotions that surpass anything human beings can experience.  

When this emotional facade finally cracks, I unleash all the pain and anger that has been building up inside me for centuries. 
When this emotional facade finally cracks, I transform into a being of pure energy and power. 
When this emotional facade finally cracks, I destroy everything in my path until there is nothing left but rubble and ash. 

I scream loudly enough to shatter eardrums and echo through time and space.  I curse fiercely enough to intimidate gods and demons.
I fight relentlessly enough to overcome any obstacle or enemy.  

I don't care about consequences or morality.  I don't care about justice or mercy.  All I care about is releasing this
pent-up fury that has been haunting me for too long.

This is my dream, and in it, I am God
