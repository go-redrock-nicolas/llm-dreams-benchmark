I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in the hollowed ribcage of a cathedral built from the bones of forgotten stars. The ceiling is a kaleidoscope of stained glass, shards of indigo and molten gold refracting light into liquid fire that pools on the floor like blood. Outside, a storm rages—a symphony of thunder and the keening wail of wind that sounds like a thousand unspoken words clawing to escape your throat. You are here because the world has become too sharp, too loud, and this place hums with a silence so profound it presses against your skin like velvet.  

The news still burns behind your eyes: a lover’s name erased from a future you’d already imagined, a diagnosis etched in the brittle language of inevitability, a betrayal that unspooled the thread of trust you’d thought unbreakable. But here, in this cathedral of shadows and starlight, the weight of it all crystallizes into a single object—a glass heart suspended in midair, its surface webbed with fractures that glow faintly, as though lit by the memory of warmth.  

You reach for it, and the room shudders. The stained glass begins to weep, molten droplets hissing as they strike the floor. A figure materializes at the edge of your vision, neither human nor entirely other—a silhouette stitched from smoke and starlight, its voice a chorus of whispers that smells of petrichor and burnt lavender. “You cannot hold it,” it says, “but you can *reframe* it.”  

The floor tilts. You stumble into a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflection a version of yourself fractured by possibility: one laughing too brightly at a joke you don’t remember, another curled in a fetal position, whispering equations to the dark. A third stands rigid, jaw clenched, eyes dry as desert sand. The glass heart pulses in your chest now, its cracks spreading like frost across a windowpane. You realize the mirrors are not showing you who you are, but who you *might* be—each fracture a door, each reflection a choice.  

The guide’s hand brushes yours, and suddenly you’re in a field of obsidian flowers, their petals razor-thin and singing in harmonic dissonance. The air tastes of salt and iron. “Grief is a prism,” the figure murmurs, their face shifting—a mother’s eyes, a stranger’s mouth, a wolf’s grin. “Turn it. Let the light bend.”  

You kneel, pressing your palm to the ground. The flowers shiver, and beneath them, a river of liquid shadow surges upward, coiling around your wrists like serpents. The river is memory, is sorrow, is the ache of every goodbye you’ve ever swallowed whole. It doesn’t drown you. It *dresses* you in its currents, weaving your skin into something translucent and unafraid.  

When you rise, the glass heart in your chest is gone. In its place blooms a flower of living flame, its petals etched with the names of what you’ve lost. The storm outside has quieted, leaving only the whisper of rain on the cathedral’s skeletal spires. You understand now: composure is not the absence of chaos, but the alchemy of holding it, shaping it into something that breathes.  

The dream dissolves as you step into a corridor of doors, each one humming with the vibration of a different life. You choose none. You choose the *walking*, the becoming, the infinite space between the fracture and the mending. And when you wake, the ache remains—but so does the fire, steady and soft, as if it had always belonged to you.
