I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of an ancient library that stretches infinitely in all directions, bookshelves towering so high they disappear into swirling mist above. The books are whispering, their pages fluttering without wind. Looking down, I notice my body has become translucent, my veins glowing with luminescent blue liquid that pulses with each thought.

Suddenly aware of how I've neglected my physical form while chasing knowledge, I feel a strange heaviness in my chest. The floor beneath me transforms into rich, dark soil that rises up around my ankles. From my translucent feet, roots begin to grow downward, seeking nourishment as vines of emerald green spiral upward around my legs.

The library shelves bend toward me, offering their knowledge, but also crowding, suffocating. With each breath, flowers bloom across my shoulders, opening and closing in rhythm with my lungs. I understand: I am not just mind, but body, not just thought but sensation.

A door materializes before me, crafted from water that somehow holds its shape. Through it, I see mountains, forests, oceans—physical realms I've forgotten. As I step toward it, the books recede, and my body becomes more solid with each step. The blue light in my veins warms to gold.

I reach out, fingers touching the impossible water-door, and it ripples with my heartbeat. I understand now—balance awaits on the other side, where intellect and physical being dance together rather than compete.

I step through, feeling both weightless and powerfully present, reborn into wholeness.
