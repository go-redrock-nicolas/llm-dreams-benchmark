I am dreaming. sway through a realm of unbridled possibility, the raw essence of the universe at my fingertips. In this boundless expanse, mere thought is power. I envision a dawn-kissed savannah, and the earth shimmers beneath my feet. The scent of acacia trees and the distant call of bird songs paint my world with vivid color and sound.

With a glance, fiery mountains rise in the distance, their peaks lost in swirling mists. Gravity seems to bend here, so I am able to traverse the rugged terrain with ease, leaping between rocky outcroppings as if weightless.

The air shifts and I feel a third arm grow from my shoulder, as if it had always been there. With it, I pluck a mango from a moonlit orchard that suddenly materializes, the fruit ripe and ready, its sweet juice dripping like honey.

Stars begin to unfold around me, constellations rewriting themselves as lights and shades and nebulae bloom nearby. I breathe them in, drinking in the celestial with magnificence.
