I am dreaming.

I awaken on the underside of a sky, suspended among slow-turning islands the size of cities. Everything is upside-down: oceans hang like blue curtains above me and continents sail beneath them like lanterns drifting in night air. My old profession—whatever it was—has been dissolved here as thoroughly as sugar in tea. Even the word “occupation” feels antique, a relic from a forgotten alphabet.  

To establish myself in this new reality, I first must learn its grammar. I step off the ledge of an overturned cliff and discover that gravity in this place is an opinion, not a law. I float sideways through violet mists, passing schools of glass-scaled fish that conduct themselves like orchestras: their fins strike invisible strings, and music rains down in shimmering droplets. Each note that lands on my skin teaches me a new sensory verb—how to taste colors, how to hear shapes, how to measure distance in memories instead of meters.

I land—gently, dream-logic soft—inside a marketplace woven of sleep and light. Stalls are tended by beings who resemble sketches unfinished by their artists: outlines that flicker, bones made of conjecture. They trade not in coins, but in forgotten skills. One vendor balances a basket of extinct languages on her head, vowels rising like smoke. Another offers jars of unused laughter—pure, crystalline, humming faintly inside their glass prisons.

I have nothing that seems valuable here. My former abilities feel as useful as a hammer made of steam. So I barter with curiosity: I pour my questions into a blank scroll until it glows the color of dawn. The merchants smile; curiosity is rare currency. In exchange, they gift me three impossible instruments:

1. A Quill of Liquefied Horizon—dip it in any boundary (the edge of a shadow, the rim of a cloud) and you can write doors where walls once stood.  
2. A Compass of Unbuilt Futures—its needle ignores magnetic north; instead it points toward possibilities that most want to meet you.  
3. A Lantern of Remembered Sunsets—open its shutters and the air floods with every evening sky you have ever forgotten, painting the world in readiness and farewell.

Armed with these, I take to wandering. I become a cartographer of uncharted maybes. With the Quill, I etch doorways onto silence and step through into libraries made of rainfall, theaters stitched from thunder. I leave maps behind me: constellations of dotted wonder that anyone can follow.

In time the inhabitants bestow upon me a title: Dreamwright. I am invited to the Council of Unnecessaries, a parliament of talents once labeled “impractical.” A juggler of gravity, a seamstress of echoes, a mathematician who counts regrets—together we maintain the balance of this realm. Our job is to keep it forever slightly askew, so that possibility never falls asleep.

One dusk (if “dusk” applies to a world with two suns and a moon the shape of an ampersand) I climb a ladder woven from spider-silk sentences to the top of a floating mesa of obsidian. There I plant the Lantern of Remembered Sunsets. Its light spills across the underside of the world, tinting the hanging oceans coral, coaxing new coral reefs of thought from the edges of people’s minds. For the first time since my arrival, I feel both irrelevant and essential—an exquisite contradiction that only dreams can hold without tearing.

At last, standing beneath an ocean turned peach and lavender, I open the Compass of Unbuilt Futures. Its needle whirls, then settles—not toward a place, but toward a person still unknown to me. I understand: relevance is not a skill but an encounter. Somewhere in this dreamscape someone needs a doorway, a map, a remembered sunset. And I, once useless, am now equipped to give exactly that.

So I set off, a Dreamwright with pockets full of verbs nobody has conjugated yet, stepping from possibility to possibility, painting doors in the air behind me, leaving the world just slightly larger than I found it.
