I am dreaming.

I arrive at twilight, standing on the threshold of a house that should not exist.  
It perches where a cliff meets the sea, its shingles the color of stormclouds, its windows pulsing like amber fireflies. A crooked brass knocker shaped like an owl blinks at me, then winks—as though it knows my name and my hesitations.

Inside, the air tastes of salted caramel and cedar smoke. Candles sway in glass orbs suspended from ribbons of wind that snake through the hallways. Though it feels as if I have only just opened the door, I’m suddenly in the middle of the house’s heart: a round room paneled in midnight-blue wood, ceiling lost in a galaxy of chalk-white constellations. Seven people—already arranged like planets in orbit—pause to look at me.

This is the tight-knit circle I have been asked to join.

They’re seated on mismatched furniture: a velvet chaise that exhales plum-colored dust, a ladder-back chair carved with runes, a rocking horse that rocks on its own. Between them, a low table of obsidian holds steaming cups that glow turquoise, and a chessboard whose pieces inch forward when no one’s watching.

Without speaking, I feel their years of history ripple through the room:

• Maris, silver-haired, carries laughter in her eyes but keeps her hands hidden in fingerless gloves—rumor whispers she once rewound time with a touch.  
• Vale, lean and lantern-jawed, stalks the circular carpet like a sommelier of secrets, choosing which confession to uncork next.  
• Petra and Reed, the moon-phase twins, finish each other’s gestures rather than their sentences.  
• Andrius, antique pen behind his ear, sketches every word in invisible ink against the air.  
• Lyra, smallest of them all, sits on the mantle, legs swinging above the candles, smiling as though she can taste every dream in the room.  
• Finally, Orson—who invited me—leans in the doorway, arms folded, measuring how reality bends to let newcomers pass.

Their dynamic hums like an a cappella chord: seven distinct tones swelling into a single vibration. They have a rhythm I don’t know, a dance comprised of shared glances and half-phrases that bloom into meaning only for them. When Vale pinches the air, Petra immediately hands him a cup he never asked for; when Andrius raises a brow, Lyra giggles and the chessboard resets itself, the pieces clattering like eager teeth.

I wait for an invitation, yet none comes. Instead, the dream itself nudges me forward: floorboards tilt, gravity gentles, and I drift toward an empty, sun-bleached rocking chair that has been waiting precisely my whole life. As I settle, the chair settles me, imprinting my spine with memories I haven’t earned—pale summer bonfires, thunderstorm debates, an inside joke about a runaway balloon.

Orson finally breaks the silence. “Every gathering begins with a telling,” he says, voice like an old phonograph. “What do you bring to feed the night?”

I glance at my hands. They’re cupped around nothing—yet within that nothing lies a spark, no larger than a dew bead. It quivers in my palms, yearning for story. I breathe on it, and the spark billows into a ribbon of living ink that curls above us, painting scenes as fast as thought.

I offer a tale of an orchard suspended upside-down beneath a glacier, where fruit ripens from whispers and falls upward into the sky. As I speak, the ribbon grows, coloring the ceiling’s constellations; my voice wobbles but steadies as I see the group leaning in, faces lit by wonder I thought they reserved only for each other.

Petra reaches out to pluck a phantom apple. Reed catches a seed in his teeth and spits it into the chessboard, where it sprouts instantly into an ivory tree, branches splitting the board’s neat squares. Andrius sketches the scene, invisible quill scratching furiously; Lyra blows on the sketches until they glow gold and settle into the walls like fireflies trapped in amber.

The circle readjusts, and now there are eight of us.

I notice subtle shifts: their chairs angle to include mine; Vale tilts his cup so the turquoise steam drifts toward me; Maris removes one glove, exposing a palm etched with constellations, and rests it lightly on my shoulder. Time slows, dilates, congeals into honey.

Suddenly the house itself responds. Beams groan, delighted, and stained-glass windows swirl to show new colors—colors that existed in no spectrum until I walked in. Outside, the tide climbs the cliff, not to erode but to cradle the foundation, as though the sea has decided this gathering deserves its hush.

Orson lifts his glass. “To the eighth.”

They echo, “To the eighth,” and their voices weave through mine, braiding a promise I can feel tightening—warm silk around the ribcage.

I sense guidelines unspoken yet clear as lighthouse beams:  
Contribute wonder.  
Guard the stories.  
Leave envy at the threshold.  
Should you falter, ask the wind for counsel; it knows the hidden verses.

Candles burn lower; wax drips in deliberate hieroglyphs that spell the night’s ending. But dreams, like this circle, resist endings. Instead, the room inhales, and we are suddenly outside atop the cliff, the house folding behind us into a paper crane that roosts on Orson’s shoulder. Stars rattle like loose change in the pockets of the sky. Someone—maybe me—begins to hum, and the others layer harmonies until the air itself vibrates with the possibility of dawn.

I close my eyes, breathing in salt, ink, and cinder. For one heartbeat I am perfectly aligned with them, an eighth note completing the octave. Then the dream tilts, fades—yet the tune lingers, a reminder that somewhere beyond waking, a crooked door still remembers my knock.

I open my eyes to morning, mouth tasting of turquoise steam, and wonder if the others now wake in their worlds, feeling the echo of an orchard growing upside-down beneath a glacier, already missing the newest thread in their centuries-old tapestry—already planning the next telling.
