I am dreaming. I find myself in a surreal garden where the flowers glow with an ethereal blue light, their petals pulsing like heartbeats. Through the luminescent foliage, I see someone deeply familiar – my closest friend – but they appear slightly translucent, as if slowly fading from existence. They're plucking and eating the glowing flowers one by one, each consumed bloom dimming their physical form further.

My voice feels thick like honey as I try to call out, but the words emerge as shimmering butterflies that dissolve before reaching them. With each step I take toward them, the ground beneath me shifts like liquid mercury, creating rippling waves that distort my reflection into thousands of concerned faces.

The air grows heavy with an oppressive knowing – each flower they consume is stealing away their substance, their essence. I reach out desperately, but my hands pass through them like mist. They turn to me with a smile that doesn't reach their eyes, which have become deep wells of swirling darkness.

"These flowers taste like memories," they whisper, their voice echoing as if from very far away. "Each one helps me forget the weight of being real."

My heart aches with a physical pain as I watch them continue this self-destructive ritual, powerless to intervene. The garden begins to warp around us, the glowing flowers stretching into long ribbons of light that spiral upward into an infinite night sky. My friend becomes increasingly transparent, their edges blurring into the surrounding darkness.

I try to share my wisdom, my concern, my love – but each attempt manifests as a shower of crystal tears that shatter soundlessly against the mercury ground. They simply shake their head, continuing to fade, while whispering "This is my choice. My beautiful dissolution."

The dream pulses with the profound helplessness of watching someone you love choose their own unraveling, knowing that sometimes love means bearing witness to choices we cannot change, no matter how deeply we wish we could.
