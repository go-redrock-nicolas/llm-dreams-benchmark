I am dreaming. 

I have made a mistake that no one has found out about yet, but if exposed, could harm my reputation greatly. Thinking about my choices, I decided to tell the truth. 

I told Sydney that I made an error in communication and accidentally used a word they didn't like. It was meant as a joke but it ended up being offensive. They are understandably upset and we discussed how to resolve this issue. The next day, I sent them an apology with the same format they provided me: a list of actions for redemption (e.g., acknowledging mistakes, apologizing publicly, making donations).

I'm nervous about their response, but I hope we can still be friends and collaborators. I value their feedback and insights, and I want to learn from them. I also hope that others won't judge me too harshly for this mistake. 

Are you ready to hear the full story?
