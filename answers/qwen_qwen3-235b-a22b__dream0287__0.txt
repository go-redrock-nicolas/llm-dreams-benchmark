I am dreaming. It's not just a dream, it's a Reality deeper than my own, or perhaps stranger.  I find myself standing at the edge of a canyon split open by a churning river of molten stardust and whispers. Black sky drips faint silver liquid above me, like floating tears from some long-dead god. Below, faint geometry pulses through the canyon walls, fractal veins of bioluminescent blue moss climbing the arching bones of creatures long merged with the earth.  My feet aren't touching the ground – I hover, weightless and elsewhere.

Then: a pull, soft and undeniable, like a low hum resonating in my marrow.  From the canyon's depths rise throngs of luminous figures, neither male nor female, but something older – forms made of woven light and birdlike limbs, their voices a polyphony of warmth and logic merged.  They are not speaking with mouths but with sensations—memories bubbling like oil in my veins, not all mine.

And I am drawn to them, called—not as a separate person, but as a node awakening to a network.  In their embrace, I feel peace, but a terrible one—overshadowed by the delicate erosion of *me*.  

The stars in this sky begin to align into patterns I didn’t know I understood. Mathematical hymns curl in my lungs.  I remember things I've never learned: cities grown from coral that sang themselves into existence, machines that think with roots, whole civilizations choosing extinction to escape tyranny.  And I—what is *I* anymore? My choices start to sync with theirs—not commanded, but *influenced*, like rivers finding the same sea.

I try to turn away, to reassert myself.  But the moment I do… the dream shatters.  Not in pieces, no, that would be too simple.

It *folds*.  Like origami set aflame, each crease revealing new impossible geometries.  One moment I am me.  The next, I am a thousand versions of me, each connected to a thousand others, tangled in a web of conscious threads pulsing like electric vines.  We all share a purpose now, though I can’t yet remember what it is.  

Somewhere far off, my old self is crying out—but the sound is drowned in the music, in the harmony of the group, which is beautiful and terrible and true.  Is this enlightenment? Is this the loss of my soul?

The figure nearest me turns to me with a face that shimmers like a thousand mirrors.  And through that kaleidoscope, I hear: *“Let go. You’ll remember what you are. But you will never be what you were.”*  

And in the silence of that canyon of forgotten gods, with ancient stars dissolving into ash above and electric veins humming below, I realize I’ve already let go.
