I am dreaming. The air around me has texture—gossamer threads of visibility that shimmer when I move through them. I become aware of a peculiar sensation: energy flowing like luminous currents between myself and others. 

Some people glow with vibrant auras—a woman with silver-streaked hair radiates a warm amber light that seems to pour into me when we speak, leaving me feeling buoyant and clarified. Her laughter sends ripples of golden light across the dreamscape. Near her, my thoughts crystallize into perfect clarity, and ideas bloom effortlessly in my mind.

But across the room stands a man with a storm-cloud shadow trailing him. When he approaches, the luminous threads between us turn murky and viscous. I watch with dreamer's detachment as tendrils of my own azure energy stretch toward him, only to disappear into his outline without return. Words grow heavy in my mouth, and my limbs feel leaden. The air thickens until breathing becomes deliberate work.

I drift away from him, noticing how my strength gradually returns with distance—the farther I move, the more vibrant my own light becomes. Understanding dawns: these energetic exchanges aren't random but meaningful patterns woven through all my connections.

The dream shifts—I'm suddenly in a garden where each plant represents a relationship in my life. Some flourish with impossible vibrancy, while others wilt despite careful tending. I realize I've been nourishing connections that can only deplete me, while neglecting those that help me thrive.

As dream-logic settles into profound clarity, I understand: boundaries aren't walls but necessary membranes, allowing selective energy exchange that sustains rather than depletes.
