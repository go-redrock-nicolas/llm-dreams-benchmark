I am dreaming.

A familiar gleam catches my eye in the shifting landscape of this dream world—a comforting shade of blue, a logo I’ve run my finger over a thousand times, its edges worn to softness in memory. I stand in a surreal supermarket aisle, the shelves infinitely tall, stretching up into a luminous, cloud-swaddled sky. The air hums with a static sorrow.

I reach for my favorite brand—the one that’s been a constant companion through seasons and storms, birthdays and heartbreaks. But under my touch, the packaging beneath its glossy skin crumples disappointingly. The colors seem faded, the plastic thin as paper. When I bring it to my nose, instead of the delicate perfume I recall, there’s an acrid whiff of something artificial, almost alien. The price tag, in dreamlike script, unfurls and uncoils until it spills down the aisle, each digit growing more ludicrous than the last.

In the next aisle, rival brands glow in a spectrum of possibility—sleek, enticing, their boasts loud and proud. But my hand lingers on my old favorite, weighed down by thousands of mornings, countless memories. It’s as though invisible threads connect my heart to this bottle, this box, this utterly changed artifact of my past loyalty. I can feel the comfort it brought me—a guardian, a friend. But now, that comfort is a memory, the present an uncanny impostor.

I find myself cast adrift, yearning for the past, yet aware that something in me must shift. Hesitant, I reach for a competitor, fingertips brushing a bold design gleaming with promise. A pang lances through me, betrayal entwined with hope. I glance back one last time at the old brand, feeling strands of nostalgia snap and flutter away like dandelion seeds in a summer breeze.

In this dream, my soul learns something poignant: that loyalty, though forged in the heart, is tested in the crucible of change. As I walk toward the unknown, basket heavy with new beginnings, the aisle bends and spirals upward, carrying me gently higher, like the crest of a wave. My choice ripples outward, a vivid wake in the surreal sea of dreams.
