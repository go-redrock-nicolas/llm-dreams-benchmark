I am dreaming. I'm standing at the threshold of an ancient stone house nestled in a valley I've never seen before, though the rolling emerald hills beyond feel oddly familiar. My fingers nervously twist the fabric of my clothes as I take a deep breath of air fragrant with unfamiliar spices and flowering trees I cannot name. This is the moment—meeting my partner's family for the first time.

The massive wooden door swings open without a sound, revealing not a standard greeting but a semicircle of family members seated cross-legged on embroidered cushions. Their eyes—all sharing the same amber hue as my partner's—turn to me with expectant gazes. The eldest woman, her silver hair elaborately braided with tiny bells that chime with each subtle movement, extends both hands palms-up toward me.

The liquid spreads across the intricate mosaic floor, transforming into tiny luminescent butterflies that flutter upward, casting dancing shadows across everyone's faces.
