I am dreaming.

A landscape unfurls before me—a realm suspended between fire and ice, sun and starlit void, pulse and stillness. I am neither walking nor flying but gliding, buoyed along currents of wind and color. On my left, a desert of burning ocher sands undulates, each dune crowned with flares of molten glass, shimmering as if the earth’s core has exhaled them. On my right, a tundra sprawls, crusted with enchanted snowflakes as big as my hands, glinting with rainbows trapped within. The air crackles with static, a promise of transformation humming at the borderland.

Every step I take, the world oscillates—a pendulum swinging between the extremes. When I drink from a crystalline spring in the snow, the water scalds with fire. When I warm myself at a golden bonfire, frost patterns bloom across my skin. I am not frightened, just deeply aware, my senses tuned to both the urgency and the hush.

A path appears—cobblestones carved from both obsidian and moonstone, set in a spiraling curve. As I follow it, the landscape around me begins to blur, the desert and tundra merging. From the sand rises a forest of glass-leafed trees, each bough glinting in the twilight, casting prismatic shadows on the gently falling snow. Wind stirs between the trees, neither too hot nor cold, gentle enough to brush away the weight of the extremes.

I encounter a creature—half-phoenix, half-white stag—with feathers of flame blending into fur of frost. Its eyes hold the wisdom of balancing fire’s passion with ice’s clarity. Wordlessly, it invites me to rest my hand on its back. When I do, a warmth—soft as sunrise—spreads through me, curling around cool tranquility. For a moment, I am wholly balanced—warmed but never burned, cooled but never numb.

The dream whispers: There is power in the borderlands, in the blending, in the subtle harmony. Balance is a living dance, not a fixed point.

I continue onward, not seeking a middle for its own sake, but learning to let fluidity and integration guide me—a sustainable dance between extremes, both in this strange, radiant dream and the waking world to come.
