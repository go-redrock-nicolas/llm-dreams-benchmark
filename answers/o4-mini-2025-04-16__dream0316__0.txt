I am dreaming. You find yourself drifting in a vast, half-lit cathedral of commerce. The air shimmers like spilled oil—rainbow-colored echoes of every label you’ve ever trusted. Beneath your feet, marble tiles are stamped with that once-beloved logo, now chipped and faded. Every step sends up a whisper of dismay, as though each tile sighs, “We aren’t what we used to be.”

Ahead, a long aisle stretches into shadow, its shelves sagging under the weight of tarnished packages. You reach out to touch one: the cardboard feels brittle, its gloss clouded. You catch a faint whiff of rancid sweetness, like perfume left open too long. The price tags gleam cruelly red—higher than you’ve ever paid before—while the promise of quality has vanished.

Turning a corner, you enter a swirling vortex of competing brands. Their logos writhe like living things: a fearless jaguar leaps from one can, a silver eagle screeches atop another, and a sly fox beckons from a neon box. They call to you in hushed, enticing tones: “Come over here. We’ve been waiting.” Yet your heart pounds with loyalty—years of trust, memories of first discoveries, late-night satisfactions.

Suddenly, the cathedral’s walls begin to peel back, revealing a howling storm outside. Sheets of rain slash inwards, drumming against the packages until they tremble. The old logo—your oncefaithful companion—rises from its shattered shrine, flickering like a dying star. It looks at you with pleading eyes, as though begging for one last chance to prove its worth.

Your hands hover between the worn shelf and the new contenders gleaming in the gale. The storm’s roar swells, pushing you toward a choice that feels both monumental and impossible. Your heart clenches: do you remain faithful to what you know, or surrender to something untested but polished and promising?

At the apex of your indecision, the dream shatters. You jolt awake, the echo of wind and fractured labels still humming in your veins. In the pale dawn light, you reach for your morning cup—uncertain which brand you’ll pour.
