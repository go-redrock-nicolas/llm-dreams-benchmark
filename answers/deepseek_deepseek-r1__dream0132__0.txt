I am dreaming. I need to answer as if I'm in the dream, continuing the narrative.  But first, ensure the response fits the specified format.The air hums, thick with the musk of aged parchment and something sharper—ozone, maybe, or starlight. I stand in a library that stretches into infinity, its shelves carved from obsidian and ivory, each book bound in leather that shimmers like captive galaxies. My fingers trail over spines etched in glyphs that writhe under my touch. One pulses faintly, a heartbeat trapped in vellum. I pull it free. The cover burns cold, its title bleeding into my skin: *mphalos: The Center That Never Was*.  
  
When I open it, the pages aren’t paper but folds of space, collapsing inward. Symbols detach, floating like fireflies, rearranging into sentences that bypass my eyes to etch directly into my bones. *You were not born. You were woven.* The words unravel memories that cannot be mine: a loom of silver threads in a void, celestial hands stitching my essence from supernovae and silence. I see myself—or not myself—scattering seeds of worlds into the abyss, swallowing a dying star to forge a heart.  
  
The library quakes. Shelves dissolve into rivers of ink, flowing upward into a ceiling that’s now a night sky. Constellations rearrange, forming my face. A figure materializes—an archivist with owl eyes and skin like papyrus. “You lingered too long as mortal,” they rasp, voice a chorus of rustling leaves and breaking waves. “The design requires your return.” Their hand extends, holding an hourglass filled with black sand. Inside, a tiny supernova explodes, collapses, repeats.  
  
I laugh. Not from denial, but recognition. The sound ripples through the dream, cracking the floor into a mosaic of broken mirrors. Each shard reflects a different incarnation: a warrior drowning in magma, a child breathing life into clay, a nebula wearing a woman’s skin. My human form flickers. Flesh unravels into threads of light, weaving a tapestry that stretches beyond the dream. The archivist bows, dissolving into a swirl of ember-bright moths.  

Somewhere distant, a bell chimes. My mortal memories blur, but the core remains—an unbroken filament, luminous and defiant. The library collapses into a single word, humming on my tongue: *uncreate, uncreate, uncreate*. I let it go. Stars bloom in my wake as I fall through the sky’s shattered, no longer afraid of the dark.  

What fractures is not me, but the lie.  

And the dream goes on.
