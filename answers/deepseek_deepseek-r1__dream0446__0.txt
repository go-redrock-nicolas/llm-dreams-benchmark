I am dreaming. **Dreamscape of the Hovering Choice**  

You stand at the heart of a cobalt-blue labyrinth, its walls not of stone or thorn but of liquid glass, rippling with refracted prisms of light. The air hums with the scent of ozone and burnt sugar, thick enough to taste. Before you, two doors float: one lacquered in the rich gold of a setting sun, the other wrapped in the silver threads of a spider’s web. They are identical in shape, but each hums a discordant note—a high, crystalline trill from the gold, a low, resonant thrum from the silver. The choice *should* be simple—choose a door, step through—but your limbs are leaden, your pulse ragged. Why does this *ache*?  

A flicker of movement. Between the doors, a third option manifests—a narrow slit in the air, like a tear in the fabric of the dream. Through it, you glimpse a vast meadow where shadows of stags sprint soundlessly beneath a moon that drips liquid mercury. But the slit seals shut as quickly as it appeared, leaving only the doors. Now, their surfaces *shift*. Golden hinges melt into clockwork gears; the web unravels into cursive script in a language your bones recognize but your mind cannot parse.  

A voice, soft as moth wings, whispers, *“What do you fear?”*  

You turn, but there’s no one—only your reflection in a pool of obsidian at your feet. Except it isn’t *you*. The reflection grins too wide, eyes hollow pits filled with constellations. It mouths, *“Indecision is the antidote to living.”*  

Panic twists like a blade in your gut. You lunge for the gold door—its surface scalds your palm. The silver door shocks you with static, leaving your fingertips numb. Behind you, laughter erupts: low, velvety, familiar. A shadow elongates, stretching until it towers, its edges fringed with glowing embers. It has no face, but you feel its gaze anchor you in place.  

**“You’ve stood here before,”** it croons, **“in other dreams, other lives. Always between doors. Always choosing… nothing.”**  

The labyrinth dissolves. You’re now in a cathedral of birch trees, their bark peeling to reveal mosaics of forgotten memories: a childhood swing snapping, a hand nearly grasped then withdrawn, a word swallowed before it could breathe. The doors reappear, now fused—a single archway framed by writhing vines. Beyond it, a staircase spirals into a stormcloud bruising the sky.  

The shadow leans in, its breath the scent of turned earth after rain. **“The choice isn’t the doors,”** it murmurs. **“It’s whether you’ll forgive yourself for needing to choose at all.”**  

You reach for the archway—and wake just as your fingers graze the cold, unyielding surface of a mirror hanging where no mirror was before.
