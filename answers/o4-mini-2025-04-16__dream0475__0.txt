I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The sky above you swirls like spilled violet ink, streaked with molten gold, and the ground beneath your feet feels warm as if it’s been sunbaked for centuries. As you wander through this surreal landscape, you feel a prickle at the back of your mind—an urgent whisper of looming disaster. You sense your thoughts coalescing into a terrible chimera, each head a worst-case scenario clamoring for your attention: “You’ll fail,” “You’ll be humiliated,” “Everything will collapse.”

In that moment, the dream slows. The winding path ahead seems to pause so that you can truly see the shape of your own fear. The chimera’s heads twist and snarl, fangs dripping with “what-ifs.” Your heart pounds, and the color of the sky deepens into a bruise-purple. Then, as if summoned by your racing pulse, a lantern floats down from above. It’s small, made of stained glass in swirling blues and greens, and it hums softly in your hand.

You lift the lantern and, in one steady breath, shine its light directly at the snarling beast. The creature recoils, hissing as the glass panes cast dancing patterns of calm on its scales. You realize that these worst-case thoughts are shadows you have the power to soften. You whisper aloud:

  • “What evidence do I have that everything will unravel?”  
  • “Have I faced difficult situations before and survived?”  
  • “What strengths do I possess that might turn this challenge into a triumph?”

As the questions flow from your lips, the beast’s heads shrink one by one. The largest head, dripping doubt, morphs into a quiet stream of silver fish that dart through the moonlit air before dissolving into starlight. The smaller heads—fear of failure, dread of judgment—curl like timid cats and pad away into the violet mist.

With each vanishing head, the landscape brightens. Flowers of luminous cerise and teal bloom along the path, their petals opening in welcome. Beneath the glow of the lantern, you see an archway formed of living vines, each leaf a promise of possibility. You step forward without hesitation.

Inside the archway is a grand hall of mirrors, but here every reflection shows you at your strongest: steady-eyed, poised to meet your challenge with courage and clarity. You reach out, touch one mirror’s surface, and feel its warmth. It vibrates with a single message: “You are ready.”

In that moment of calm triumph, you wake—or perhaps you simply glide into a clearer layer of the dream—knowing that the worst-case scenarios have lost their power. Their echoes may linger, but you hold the lantern now. Wherever the path leads, you will walk it with light in your hand and confidence in your heart.
