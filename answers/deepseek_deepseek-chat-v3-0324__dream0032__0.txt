I am dreaming. The air hums with unsung symphonies of emotion, a swirling tapestry of joy, sorrow, fear, and wonder pressing against my skin like a living thing. I stand in a vast plaza—a place that feels both ancient and infinite, its edges blurred by the soft haze of twilight. The ground beneath my feet pulses faintly, as if breathing, and the sky is an ever-shifting canvas of colors too complex to name.  

People—no, not just people, but beings of countless shapes and forms—flood the space. A weeping woman with silver hair glides past, her grief a cold river pouring into me, and for a moment, my chest aches with a loss I’ve never known. Before I can steady myself, a child’s laughter rings out, bright and wild, sending golden sparks of delight skittering down my spine. My own mouth curves into a grin I didn’t summon.  

Then comes the storm.  

Terror—sharp, metallic—from a man crumpling to his knees nearby. My breath catches as panic claws through my veins, but before I drown in it, a wave of serenity washes over me, radiating from a hooded figure sitting cross-legged on the stones. Their calm becomes my own, slow and deep as an ocean. I sway between extremes, a leaf caught in the winds of a thousand unseen hearts.  

The dream shifts. Hands reach for me—some warm with love, others crackling with anger—and as I touch them, I realize: I’m not just feeling them. I’m weaving them together. Strands of heartache braid into harmonies; loneliness becomes shared understanding. The plaza trembles, colors deepening into something sacred. Someone whispers, **"This is how the world heals."**  

And then—warm light. A slow awakening. The dream lingers, not just in memory, but in my fingertips, humming, waiting.
