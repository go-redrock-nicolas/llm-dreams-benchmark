I am dreaming. The world feels different, alive with whispers and colors I've never seen awake. It's a tapestry of shifting places, each more vivid than the last. I stand in a circular room, where walls breathe, pulsing gently like the heartbeat of something ancient. The whispers crescendo as geometric symbols on the walls begin to glow, shifting and morphing into words I can't yet read.

"You're here to find what was lost," a voice says. It’s not my own yet somehow familiar—like the echo of a memory from another lifetime. The room answers with a vibration, soft at first, as if agreeing. A lattice of light spreads beneath my feet, weaving into a shining bridge that stretches into nothingness. I take a deep breath, stepping forward.

My foot lands on the light, and instantly, the world begins to reform around me. The bridge spirals upward into the darkness, and I climb it as though pulled by an invisible thread. At its peak, the air shimmers, and I step into a place where the sky bends drunkenly overhead, stars winking in holographic ribbons. Below me, landscapes rise: mountains of crystal that hum in harmonic tones, rivers of iridescent mist flowing through valleys of impossible flowers.

I stand on the edge of this impossible reality, wind tugging at my hair, when I see it. A shadow moves beneath the mist. It rises, serpentine and enormous, its scales shimmering in colors that shift like oil on water. It turns its head toward me, cradling me in eyes that glow with ancient light.

"Thank you," the serpent says, its voice a thunder-rumble. "You have brought something back."
