I am dreaming. In my lucid slumber, I find myself abruptly thrust into a nightmare scenario. I am standing in a sterile, high-tech briefing room, the harsh fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. Dressed in a crisp, ill-fitting uniform that I assume is that of a commander, I shift uncomfortably under the weight of the declaration before me. The Director appointed me to lead their elite task force, a hand-picked group tasked with a mission of utter secrecy and immense danger. 

I glance around the room, my heart pounding in my chest as I see the faces of my team. These warriors of unparalleled skill and unquestionable expertise eye me skeptically, some with open distaste. A grizzled veteran with battle scars etched into his weathered skin fixes me with a particularly disdainful glare. How could a man with no specialized training or experience wisely command men and women of his caliber?

I clear my throat, trying to gather the scraps of my meager confidence. "Ladies and gentlemen, Iâ€”" My voice cracks and I start again. "I am honored and humbled to have been chosen as your commander. I may not have the vast experience that each of you possesses, but I am committed to learning quickly and proving myself worthy of this position."

Doubt ripples through the assembled operatives. I can practically see them deflate, their initial adrenalin hype dampened by the rude awakening of their new lackluster leader.

A lithe and lethal-looking woman with raven locks reaches toward the table and taps the touch screen. A dizzying array of data fields come alive and move fluidly across the glass. 
"Sirs, our drone has just captured this signal," she says, her sultry voice tinged with impatience. "This needs your immediate attention."

I strain to make sense of the detailed files, cyber-threats, and geographical maps that bloom up on display.

The grizzled vet scoots forward, cigar jutting from his beard. "Son, look, I'd love nothing more than to trust that you're the man for the job, but it's clear to anyone with eyes what a miscalculation making you commander is. I don't want to die at the hand of some rookie mistake."

I swallow down resentment and try to maintain my composure. "I understand your concerns, sir. I'm not asking you to trust me blindly. I'm asking for a chance to earn that trust. If I fail, as commander, it's on me. We'll do this mission together because there's no other way. We're all each other has."

The operative sighs heavily and returns to studying the data, ignoring me. It's clear that I'll have to prove myself before I have any hope of earning their respect and getting them to believe in me.

I stare down at the mission details again, cold fear prickling its way up my spine as I realize exactly what I've agreed to take on. This isn't some entry-level position or training seminar. It's a life or death game and anyone in my path could be the dealbreaker.

I've already stepped up. There's no turning back now.

The dream world fades away as I awake trembling and covered in cold sweat, my mind still reeling from my sudden, shocking dream role.
