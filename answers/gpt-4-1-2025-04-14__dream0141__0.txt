I am dreaming. …I am suddenly aware—not just of the glittering, expectant eyes of the audience, but of the way my costume hangs awkwardly on my frame, the strange weight of unfamiliar instruments in my hands. In this dream, I had prepared for a piano concerto, delicate melodies spinning through my mind, but before me now stands a swirling, living sculpture of crystal and shifting light, a bizarre hybrid of harp and clockwork, shimmering and humming with impossible chords.

My heart swells with panic and possibility. The stage is not what it should be—a velvet theater or a grand concert hall—but a luminescent forest that pulses and breathes, trees bent like violin bows, branches tipped with keys of silver and gold. The audience is not seated, but floats gently above the mossy ground, clusters of translucent shapes—swans with the faces of old friends, glowing stars draped in heavy cloaks. Their attention is palpable, a heat that prickles along my skin.

The spotlight is not a single beam, but a warm cascade of color, painting my movements in kaleidoscopic patterns. My hands, traitors to my confusion, hover momentarily, then gently settle on the outlandish instrument before me. Its strings hum beneath my fingertips. I take a deep breath and make a choice—abandoning everything rehearsed, surrendering to the wild, open moment.

I draw sound from the impossible machine, chords that glitter with the taste of memories and the ache of longing. Melodies bloom, wilting and unfurling like night-blooming flowers, unfamiliar and yet speaking to some hidden part of me. The audience, attentive and radiant, shivers with recognition. Each note is a leap without a safety net, each phrase daring the dream to spin further from the known.

As the notes spiral through the living forest and the swan-stars dance and sigh, I realize my preparation—while “wrong” in one world—knew nothing of the possibilities that live within this one. The finale is not an explosion of applause, but a wave of blossoming light and sound, washing over all of us, dissolving the stage’s edges until dream and waking, performer and audience, dissolve into one shimmering vision, right and wrong giving way to a vast, glorious creation in the dark and dazzling theater of sleep.
