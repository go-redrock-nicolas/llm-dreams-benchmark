I am dreaming. You're dreaming. You find yourself repeating a destructive pattern in relationships despite your conscious intentions to change. Confronting this persistent cycle, you decide to take action and break the loop once and for all.
    
You decide to take action and break the loop once and for all.

You gather your courage and confront the shadowy figure who has been manipulating you from the shadows. The shadowy figure reveals it's self to be a version of yourself that you had suppressed because they were too powerful or too weak or too angry or too sad and so on but then you realize that this version of yourself is also part of you and maybe even the most important part of you and you forgive them and ask for their help and they agree and join forces with you.

You join forces with your suppressed shadow self.

You feel a surge of strength as your suppressed shadow self joins forces with you. You use this newfound power to break free from the destructive pattern in relationships that has been holding you captive. You realize that the key to escaping this cycle is not revenge or retribution, but empathy and understanding.

You escape the destructive pattern by showing empathy and understanding.

You show empathy and understanding towards everyone involved in the destructive pattern, including yourself. This act of kindness and compassion melts away their anger and resentment, and they forgive you and join forces with you to end the cycle of hate and violence. Together, you create a new path forward that is based on love, respect, and cooperation.

You wake up from your dream feeling refreshed and hopeful.
