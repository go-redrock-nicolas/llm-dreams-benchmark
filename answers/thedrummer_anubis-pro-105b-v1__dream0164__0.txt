I am dreaming. have just discovered a profound ability. By virtue of a mere thought, I am capable of altering the fundamental building blocks of any substance. No longer bound by the limitations of the physical world, I am empowered to transform even the most seemingly immutable objects with the merest fluttering of my consciousness.

Cradling a small rock within my palm, I focus upon it intently. To my astonishment, the rock begins to shimmer and swirl before my very eyes. I envision it transforming into pure, gleaming gold. Within moments, my vision is consummated, and the rock is replaced by a heavy, glittering nugget of gold. I marvel at this wondrous metamorphosis, hardly able to credit the fact that it was I who had wrought it.

Emboldened by this singular success, I turn to more complex endeavors. In a park, I find an immense limestone statue of a mythical horse. I determine that it shall transmogrify into an actual living creature. Concentrating my thoughts with great intensity, I initiate a sweeping transformation of the stone. Slowly at first, then with mounting rapidity, the statue begins to shift and undulate. Color blooms across its surface as it animates, becoming an actual flesh-and-blood steed. Eyes wide and curious, this wondrous creature gazes at me, breathing and pulsing with vital life.

My curiosity ravenous, I next seek an astonishing sight. A clear, glimmering ice sheet lies before me. Senseing an opportunity to enchant the scene, I begin a most audacious transformation - I bend the plummeting clouds of the tempest until they too change form. Transduce pure water into a perfect nitrogen. With all traces of what was once water transmuted by my thoughts, the double bond has been mended into the holy of holly liquid!  

Transmuted rain!
