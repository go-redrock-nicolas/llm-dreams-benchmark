I am dreaming. …and you let their warmth pull you into a current of color and sound the ordinary city never shows its waking residents. The strangers—there are five of them—walk with a cadence that syncs to your heartbeat. One has hair like iridescent river glass; another’s jacket is stitched with constellations that seem to flicker and rearrange every time you blink. The tallest carries an umbrella made of transparent silk, even though the sky is dry; the umbrella hums softly, as if remembering rainfall from another world.

They guide you through an alleyway whose brick walls turn to aquamarine tiles mid-stride. Neon signs dissolve into drifting koi, their scales glimmering electric pink and tangerine, darting above your head as if the very air has become water. A hush falls, muffling the distant traffic, and your shoes begin to glide—no longer clacking on pavement but skimming over a surface that feels like the skin of a drum, taut and gently resonant.

“Here,” says the woman with constellation thread, pressing a folded scrap of star-paper into your palm. It unfolds itself, revealing a map of arterial streets now pulsing like living veins. At the center glows a tiny golden dot labeled You Are Becoming Found. Each vein flickers, offering possible paths, but the strangers steer you toward a door you could’ve sworn was a fire hydrant seconds ago.

Beyond the door, the city’s cacophony shifts to a symphony. Skyscrapers tilt gracefully, forming arches of steel and glass that ring like enormous crystal goblets when a breeze passes. Pigeons glide overhead, their wings trailing ribbons of handwritten letters that spell encouraging words before fluttering apart like confetti. And there, at the plaza’s heart, stands a colossal clock not of brass or bronze but of moonlight—its hands made of silver beams, its face reflecting phases you’ve never seen: crescents inside crescents, eclipses within eclipses.

The kind strangers form a circle around you. One by one, they raise their palms toward the moon-clock. Threads of light extend, weaving into a shimmering lattice, and suddenly you sense the city rearranging itself inside your chest. Streets align to your pulse; lampposts flare in recognition; you realize the map is no longer in your hand but etched gently beneath your skin—glimmering routes, soft and sure.

A hush of gratitude blooms in your throat. You look up to thank them, but they are already dissolving into motes of color, joining the koi in the neon river. A final voice—perhaps all of theirs combined—whispers, “You were never truly lost. You were only waiting for your own light to find the mirrors.”

With that, the dream tilts like the turning of a kaleidoscope, and the city—quiet, radiant, yours—breathes you awake.
