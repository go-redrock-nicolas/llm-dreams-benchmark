I am dreaming.

The world is saturated with chaos and flickering red light. Sirens wail in endless, staccato loops, echoing through the city’s labyrinth of broken glass and choking smoke. I stand at the apex of a pulsing emergency command center—a fragile island in a tempest of disaster. All around me, the curved walls breathe with frantic activity. Multi-colored screens stutter, half-flickering to darkness, while radios crackle with bursts of static and distorted voices. From every direction, reports are shouted and relayed, voices tightening with terror: a chemical fire at the refineries to the east; a flash flood swallowing the avenues along the river; an underground train derailed in absolute blackness; children trapped in the rising waters.

My hands are slick with sweat as I grasp the radio, its signal unreliable, my urgent words dissolving into static. Communication systems blink and flicker, their promises of order rendered hollow. Each message must be relayed, then repeated, then given again, like a desperate litany whispered to the powers that be. Maps are unspooled across the surfaces, annotated in trembling marker: red lines here, blacked-out quadrants there, warning symbols crowding every inch. The phones ring, fall silent, then shriek anew.

Outside, the pulse of blue lights reflects off swollen clouds, painting the ruins with ghostly flashes. My voice—steady, then pleading—commands a fire crew to turn back, the bridge ahead half-collapsed and sliding into oblivion. I deploy police to the hospital's battered windows, where evacuees signal with cell phone stars, their lights dying as batteries wane. A helicopter, a barely-heard hum above the storm, drifts like a lost moth through swathes of heavy rain.

All the while, the faces around me—fire chiefs, paramedics, desperate citizens—search mine for answers. Each decision is weighted by hundreds of invisible lives, by silent rooms and drowned sirens, by mothers calling out names that disappear in the night. And all the systems, which should have made us strong, fail me—lines dead, screens adrift in digital snow, trusted routines falling away like burning leaves.

Still, I improvise. I send a message via runners and handwritten notes. I tap out codes in the darkness, muscle and memory guiding me past technology’s crumbling edge. “Rescue here,” I write, “Help on the way.” I see in those moments the purest threads of determination: firefighters carrying children on their backs through boiling water; medics stitching wounds by lantern-light; strangers opening their doors to the lost.

Every moment balances on an impossible wire strung above calamity. Yet as I orchestrate the fragmented energies of broken machines and resilient humans, I feel—surging beneath the exhaustion and fear—something vast and powerful: resolve, thrumming brighter than any alarm or warning. Somehow, against the tide, hope is transmitted, fragile but inexhaustible, bridging every fractured signal and battered, shining heart.
