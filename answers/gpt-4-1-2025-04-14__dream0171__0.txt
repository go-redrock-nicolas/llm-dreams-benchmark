I am dreaming. …the dread hits like a sudden, icy gale. My heart pounds loud enough to drown out the low murmur of anticipation filling the vaulted auditorium. Spotlights glare down, illuminating a sea of expectant faces—gleaming eyes, clipboard scribbles, the glint of a news camera’s red dot. Giants of the industry occupy the front row, gilded and immovable, their expressions impassive, sphinxlike.

Papers tremble in my hands—embezzled charts, spun statistics, friendly numbers now twisted into impossible, illogical forms. An entire section is gibberish: bar graphs climb off the page, axes that should cross instead spiral away in smoke, and, with a jolt, I realize my slides are flowering into vivid, mocking sketches. A pie chart has grown a real cherry stem. Decision-makers lean closer, squinting, whispers hissing like wind through a wheat field.

My knees weak, I cast a look at the exit, which bulges and shrinks as if viewed underwater. My shoes root to the carpet. A clock ticks at double speed above the stage, hands spinning with giddy delight, counting down toward some impossible, irreversible truancy.

And yet—deep in my chest, a strange new resolve flickers. What if I laugh, join the absurdity? What if I tell the truth: that data is wild and the world unscripted, always bursting out of our best expectations? 

I clear my throat. My voice is alien, echoing. “Ladies and gentlemen,” I announce, as the charts behind me burst into color and animation of their own accord. “Today, with your permission, we abandon the script and chase the truth together…”

Gasps and titters rise. The decision-makers’ faces break—some into frowns, but others into sharp, intrigued smiles. I dive into improvisation, weaving a tale around the mistakes, drawing connections no one expects, ideas undreamed until this moment. The dream pulses with possibility, the audience now rapt, my own fear melting into exhilaration as, for once, everything goes off the rails—yet somehow, incredibly, toward a brighter, braver ending.
