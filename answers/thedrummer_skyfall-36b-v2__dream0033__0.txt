I am dreaming. As you blink, confused, the musty air of the underground chamber fills your lungs. Panic rises in your chest as you realize the gravity of your situation. The floor beneath you crumbles away into darkness, leaving you stranded in a dimly lit cavern. Torches flicker along the stone walls, casting eerie shadows that dance and writhe like restless spirits.

You take a deep breath, determined to stay calm, as your eyes adjust to the gloom. The chamber is circular, with a high ceiling lost in darkness. Strange symbols are etched into the walls - symbols that seem to pulse and shift before your eyes. There's a low, steady droning sound, like the murmur of whispered chants, echoing through the chamber.

In the center of the room, a circular pool of dark, mirror-smooth water catches the torchlight. A sense of unease prickles your skin as you approach the edge, peering into the swirling depths. A tang of copper reaches your nostrils - the scent of blood.

Suddenly, the water begins to churn. Bubbles boil to the surface, and a shape takes form beneath. Rising from the pooled darkness, a figure emerges - a woman, naked and dripping, with long, tangled black hair and eyes that are solid black, with no iris or white. She steps out of the water, leaving beads of crimson in her wake.

"Who are you?" you manage to whisper, voice hoarse with fear.

A slow, terrible smile spreads across her face. In a voice like rustling dry leaves, she speaks: "I am the guardian of this place. You should not have come here, mortal. Now, you are a sacrifice, offered to the Old Ones, deep in this earth. And they will make you into something... new."

She reaches out a long-nailed finger. It drips a single, thick black tear, which jerks forward - then you are unable to keep from looking her in the eye. Her gaze presses into yours, pulling, and in a breath your world jerks aside. Strength bleeds away, and you are sinking. Sinking forward.
