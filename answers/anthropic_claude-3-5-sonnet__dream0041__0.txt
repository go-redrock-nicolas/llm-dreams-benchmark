I am dreaming. I find myself in an impossibly tall glass auditorium, where the walls seem to stretch endlessly upward into a misty darkness that swirls like storm clouds. The seats are filled with shadowy figures in formal attire, their faces bearing an unsettling combination of expectation and judgment. Their eyes gleam like distant stars in the dimness.

I'm standing at a podium made of shifting, liquid mercury that ripples beneath my trembling hands. Before me lies a task I thought I knew well - but now the papers in front of me are transforming, the letters crawling across the pages like insects, forming words and equations I've never seen before. My mouth goes dry as I realize these experts - these prestigious shadows - are waiting for me to demonstrate something I suddenly understand nothing about.

My clothes feel wrong - too tight in some places, too loose in others. I reach for my notes, but they turn to sand and slip through my fingers. The audience leans forward in perfect unison, their collective breath creating a wind that stirs my hair. The mercury podium begins to pulse with a faint red glow, matching the increasing rhythm of my heartbeat.

Time stretches like taffy - I have both hours and milliseconds before I must begin. The knowledge I need feels just out of reach, like a word on the tip of my tongue, but every time I grasp for it, it dances away into the shadows. The temperature in the room fluctuates wildly - freezing cold one moment, suffocating heat the next.

The experts' eyes grow larger, brighter, more demanding. Their silence is deafening, pressing against my ears like cotton wool. I open my mouth to speak, but my voice has become a stranger to me. The floor beneath my feet begins to undulate gently, like standing on the surface of a calm ocean that threatens to become stormy at any moment...

The dream is so vivid, so real, that the line between reality and imagination blurs completely, leaving me suspended in this moment of exquisite anxiety and uncertainty.
