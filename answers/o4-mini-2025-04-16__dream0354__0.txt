I am dreaming. You step forward into a vast hall of fractured mirrors, each pane shimmering with a different moment from your past: the heated argument you thought you’d buried, the whispered apologies you never really meant, the silent tears you blamed on someone else. A low hum thrums under your feet, like the heartbeat of the building itself. You realize you are walking on a mosaic of broken promises—colored glass tiles that glitter with every misstep.

At the far end of the hall stands a tall, robed figure whose face is obscured by shadows. In one hand they hold a twisted string of puppets—each one fashioned from a memory of you and someone you loved. As you approach, those tiny puppets begin to dance an all-too-familiar choreography: the push and pull, the anger flaring up like wildfire, the tears, the apologies, and then the collapse into distance once more. Your heart pounds in sympathy and horror at how precise their movements are, as if scripted by your own fears.

You raise a hand to stop the dance. The robed figure inclines its head, and the puppets freeze mid-twirl. In that instant the mirrors behind you explode in a cascade of prisms and shards, raining down light that fractures across your skin. Everything goes white—then you’re standing alone in a silent courtyard under a purple sky. Lavender petals drift down around you, as though the world itself has exhaled a sorrowful perfume. At the center of the courtyard is a fountain whose water bleeds red at the edges, coalescing into the shape of a heart that pulses in time with your breath.

A voice, neither entirely male nor female, emerges from the fountain: “Why do you return to the same wound, hoping each time it will heal itself?” The words echo across the stone, making each syllable heavy and laden with memory. You kneel beside the fountain’s basin and peer into the water. For a moment you see your own face—pale, trembling—then it dissolves into a montage of faces you’ve loved and lost. Each one accuses you in silence: “You promised to be different.”

Tears well in your eyes, hot and earthly. But instead of turning away, you cup the water in your hands. The red tint seeps through your fingers, but you don’t recoil. You lift the water up to your lips and drink. As the liquid slides down your throat, the faces in the fountain’s surface ripple and merge until they form one single, new reflection: a stronger, wiser you—marked by past mistakes but no longer defined by them.

The robed figure reappears at the courtyard’s edge, raising both arms in benediction. The purple sky brightens to gold, petals swirl into a gentle whirlwind, and the fountain’s heart bleeds crystal-clear water. You rise, shoulders squared for the first time, feeling the sting of tears transform into purpose. The dream hall of mirrors, the dancing puppets, the accusing faces—all fade into the soft light. 

You awake with your heart pounding, the taste of red-tinted water on your tongue, and a single, radiant thought ringing in your mind: this cycle may have shaped you, but you alone hold the power to reclaim your story.
