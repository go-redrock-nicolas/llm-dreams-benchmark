I am dreaming. I float weightlessly through a city of glass and light, where buildings curve like waves frozen in time. The sky above shifts between impossible colors—a deep violet bleeding into emerald green, with ribbons of gold that appear to be both distant stars and nearby fireflies simultaneously. When I breathe, my exhalations become luminous butterflies that flutter away carrying my thoughts.

The streets below me are rivers of flowing mercury, reflecting fractured versions of myself. Sometimes I catch glimpses of faces—some I recognize, others I've never seen but somehow know intimately. A woman with eyes like kaleidoscopes beckons me toward a doorway etched into the trunk of a colossal tree that wasn't there moments ago.

Inside, the tree's interior expands into a vast library where books float freely, their pages turning by themselves. Words leap from page to page, rearranging themselves into poetry that echoes throughout the chamber. The poetry speaks of memories I've never lived but somehow mourn for—cities beneath the ocean, conversations with ancient beings, love affairs across parallel dimensions.

A staircase made of cascading water spirals upward, each step solid despite its liquid nature. I ascend and emerge onto a plateau overlooking an endless savanna where herds of creatures—part mechanical, part organic—graze on crystalline grass that chimes softly with each breath of wind.

The horizon bends upward until I realize I'm inside an enormous sphere, another world contained within a droplet hanging from a leaf in some greater forest I cannot comprehend. As this awareness dawns, the boundaries between myself and the dreamscape begin to blur until I am both the dreamer and the dream itself, creating and experiencing simultaneously in an infinite loop of consciousness.
