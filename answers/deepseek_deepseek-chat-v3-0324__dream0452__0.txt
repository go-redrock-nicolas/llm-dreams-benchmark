I am dreaming. The air around me hums with the weight of unspilled words, thick as syrup, golden like the last light of a drowning sun. I stand at the edge of a vast, glassy lake that stretches endlessly into the horizon, its surface so still it feels like a mirror of polished obsidian—yet beneath its depths, dark shapes move languidly, shadows of what once was, swimming in slow, melancholic circles.  

The shore beneath my bare feet is made not of sand, but of crushed rose petals, crimson and brittle, crumbling softly with each step. Their scent is intoxicating—sweet, but edged with the metallic tang of something fading. I realize with a pang that this was once a garden, lush and verdant, where laughter dripped like nectar between the roots of things. Now, even the petals are whispering apart, carried away by an unseen wind.  

A voice—familiar, loved, once as warm as a hearth—echoes from across the water, distorted as though speaking through a veil of time. The lake ripples slightly, not from the wind, but from the weight of its presence. A figure emerges, wavering like a reflection, halfway between a ghost and a memory. Their eyes, once bright and full of devotion, are clouded now, pupils like ink dispersing in water.  

I reach out, but my fingers pass through them like smoke. The realization settles into my bones with an ache both sharp and inevitable: this love, once a current that carried us, has become an undertow, pulling instead of lifting. The ground beneath me shifts again, the petals turning to dry ash, the lake’s reflection fracturing into a thousand shards of silver.  

But then—a warmth at my back. A new breeze, light and insistent, tugging gently at my hair. A whisper, tender and invitational:  

*"Turn around."*  

And behind me, beyond the withered shore, a field of wildflowers stretches toward a dawning sky—an untamed, brilliant tapestry of life ready to be walked into. The dream shivers with possibility. I take one last glance at the dark water, the vanishing figure, the ashes beneath my toes. Then, with a breath both heavy and free, I turn and step into the unknown bloom.  

I wake with the scent of fresh blossoms still clinging to my skin.
