I am dreaming. …lean forward and feel the pages of a thousand books surge past your fingertips like a storm of butterflies.

The library is endless, yet everything happens at once. Shelves rise and fall in ripples, forming tidal waves of leather-bound tomes that crest above your head. Every spine glows with phosphorescent ink: equations crackle like lightning; musical notations hum; half-formed sentences twist, coil, and bloom into full paragraphs before dissolving into dust. A gargantuan clock—transparent, made of prisms—hangs upside down from the vaulted sky, its gears reversing time in slow, shimmering spirals. You have ten heartbeats to memorize it all, but each heartbeat contracts into a blink, then fractures into milliseconds.

You inhale, and the air itself is data. Syllables flood your lungs, numbers drip from stalactites of thought, theories take root behind your eyes. You try to focus on a single concept: quantum seashells singing the Fibonacci sequence—yet it bursts apart into a flock of origami cranes, each crane chirping a different theorem. You chase them down the corridor, but the floor converts to a scroll of parchment that rolls backward under your feet, writing itself in real time: “REMEMBER ME, REMEMBER ME,” in a language you suddenly understand and instantly forget.

A librarian materializes—tall, faceless, wearing robes stitched from maps of constellations. Instead of offering assistance, the figure lifts a feather-quill comet and dips it into the liquid ink of midnight. They press the nib to your forehead. Galaxies pour into you, hot and bright, until your skull feels like a lantern, brilliance leaking through every pore. You can almost recite the swirling star-catalogue inside your veins, but the symbols invert themselves when you speak, turning vowels into black holes that swallow each sentence.

Panic flares, but the dream shifts. Now you stand on a glass bridge above a canyon of mirrors. Reflections below replay every lecture you’ve ever heard, each echo louder than the last. You try to sift meaning from the cacophony, yet the words rebound, colliding into kaleidoscopic abstractions: algorithms blossoming into roses, historical dates dripping like candlewax. You sense the canyon walls closing in—though you’re not sure if they are shrinking or if your own mind is becoming immeasurably vast, pressing against the limits of its container.

A bell tolls: one chime, the duration of eternity. Everything freezes. You feel the entire library, canyon, and sky condense into a single translucent marble that hovers between your palms. Within it gleams every fact, formula, poem, and secret you’ve ever pursued. It pulses with knowledge, waiting for you to claim it. Your instinct is to swallow the marble whole, but a whisper threads through the dreamspace: “Let go, and you will remember.”

Breathing out, you release the marble. It bursts into stardust that settles onto your skin like snow. The information is no longer external—it has become your bloodstream, your heartbeat, your breath. You realize you do remember it all, effortlessly, as though the burden never existed. The overwhelming mass is suddenly weightless, fluid, luminous.

You open your dream-eyes one last time. The infinite library has vanished; in its place stretches a tranquil field under a violet dawn. Dewdrops on the grass refract unread verses of poetry. Far above, the upside-down clock dissolves into morning clouds, its final tick echoing softly across the horizon.

You awaken—yet within you lingers the afterglow of that impossible knowledge, sparkling like phantom constellations whenever you close your eyes.
