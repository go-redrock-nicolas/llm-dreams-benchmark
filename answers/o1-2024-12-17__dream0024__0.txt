I am dreaming. You drift into a sparkling, surreal slumber—like falling through a pool of liquid blue moonlight—and feel your consciousness dissolve into a dream. The world around you seems to rebuild itself, piece by piece, as if plucked from a divine mosaic floating in the starry sky. You blink once, then twice, and find yourself in your bedroom, but… something is off.

The faint morning sun filters in through your curtains, yet somehow, the shadows are tinted a deep purple. The clock on your nightstand that once chirped merrily now purrs softly, as if it’s alive. And that’s only the beginning. You glance at your phone, expecting the familiar beep, but all you hear is a hushed “shhh,” as if technology has become secretive and shy overnight.

Slowly, you make your way to the window. The scene outside is both mesmerizing and alarming: People wander the streets, but not in the typical morning rush. They move as though they’re tiptoeing, casting darting glances at one another. Some clutch old novels and eye them with the reverence once reserved for precious heirlooms. Others wear scarves around their faces, not for warmth or health, but to hide what appears to be forbidden expressions—smiles.

A sense of electric unease loops through the air. It’s as though everyone has discovered that all the comfortable, familiar gestures—laughing, singing, the freedom to chat openly—are now forbidden by some abrupt change in the cosmic rulebook. You can almost taste the underlying tension clinging to every breath. Neighbors who used to greet each other with a wave and a kind word now glance side to side, uncertain, as if hoping no one will notice them. Streetlamps flicker with an eerie soul-like glow, policing the roads with silent observation.

In the distance, you spot a towering structure that wasn’t there before: a marble obelisk decorated with silver-inlaid designs, standing tall and severe as if it has always existed. Its surface pulses with swirling lines that seem alive, weaving and curling in patterns both entrancing and slightly menacing. You feel it, calling you, commanding you, as though the very heart of this new reality throbs within its walls.

Stepping outside, the warmth from the sun is replaced by a delicate, almost chilly aura. The air smells faintly of sweet gardenias and crackling electricity, as though nature has merged with some futuristic dream. A hush envelops every step you take, and the ground beneath your feet feels subtly soft, too alive to be simple concrete.

A whisper from behind startles you: a child clutching a two-headed teddy bear points to your hands. You look down to see a small, silvery mark glowing on the back of your right hand—a symbol you have never seen before, like a crescent moon carved by an ancient civilization. The child points at it, his eyes growing wide, then he runs away in fear. It dawns on you that this mark may be connected to whatever laws replaced the old ones overnight. 

You realize with a heavy heart that the simple, carefree actions from the day before—casual handshakes, smiling greetings, the chatter at coffee shops—all vanished in a single moment. At the corners of this new reality are signs that declare “No Expression” in a language that, somehow, you can read yet appears utterly alien. Strange silhouettes patrol the streets—humanoid figures in sleek reflective suits. Each figure’s face is hidden behind a mirror-like visor that reflects your own anxious expression a hundred times over, as if mocking your confusion.

The only reassurance you have is the glowing symbol upon your skin. There’s a faint hum in your mind, a silent heartbeat, a pull that points you toward that towering obelisk. Perhaps the obelisk holds the key to undoing this twisted transformation. Perhaps it’s where defiance meets resolution, where the old ways of laughter and free speech might rise again.

There is no turning back. Even as your mind swirls with questions—Who changed the rules? Will the world ever return to normal?—you realize it does not matter. You have to uncover the secret hidden within the strange new laws. You must walk through the dreamscape, wading through hush and suspicion, to discover whether the powers that be can be challenged. 

Broken shards of reality crunch softly beneath your feet, each producing melodic chimes instead of the expected glassy jangle. Fireflies drift in broad daylight, their lights gently pulsing in sympathy with your every footstep. And still, the shimmering mark on your hand gleams, guiding and encouraging you like a vigilant guardian star.

So you press forward. You must unravel this new order, unmask the reason behind society’s eerie transformation, and dare to restore the warm, comforting glow of old freedoms—one secret at a time. And though your heart trembles, a determination kindles within you. You feel it rise behind your ribs, coiling like a phoenix, ready to blaze through the silent shadows and reclaim a world that remembers how to greet the day with laughter.
