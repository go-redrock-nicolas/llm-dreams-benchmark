I am dreaming. It is a nightmarish scenario.  

My surroundings are fuzzy, but I am standing in a colosseum-like stadium.  Spectators sit in the stands that extend up into the clouds.  The roar of the crowd is deafening.  I'm not sure what brought me here, or why I am here.

The crowd quiets down a bit as a spotlight shines on the center of the field.  I shield my eyes as the light finds me.  I look around and see all eyes on me.  A quiver of nervousness and fear courses through me.  I know why I am here now.

At the far end of the field, there is a small stage with a single microphone.  My imagination has painted a scene that is horrifying in its raw emotional intensity.

I am here to be critiqued for my most recent work, a deeply personal endeavor that displays my innermost thoughts and emotions.  Worries I have about myself - my physical appearance, intelligence, my ability to connect and be loved.  All of it is in this work.  To be scrutinized by others.  By these strangers.

The first person approaches the microphone and begins to speak.  Their words are difficult to hear as the wind picks up, but I make out phrases like "utter disappointment" and "lack of talent".  The words strike me like knives.  The crowd cheers each insult like it's a point scored in a game.

In the distance, robed figures emerge from the shadows, each holding parchment.  They are silent but direct in their approach.  I know they represent the world's harshest critics.  The crushing force of their expectations and judgments weigh me down.

As more robed figures approach, I feel the energy drain from me, the invasive and harsh criticisms filling me with terror and dread.  I can feel myself shrinking, wanting to disappear from this horrible place.

The robed figures become a towering tidal wave that rushes toward me. I recognize the people who wear the robes - the faces of lost family members, ex-friends, and loved ones. I understand now that their harsh critique isn't about destroying me, but shaping me.  

Powerless, I surrender. I let it wash over me and embrace the crushing feeling. It feels like drowning, then it feels like acceptance. Each critique now absorbs into me, and I see how it highlights my vulnerabilities, my self-doubts, and my growth.

Looking around, I am no longer in the colosseum. I am at peace in a vast field, with beautiful prismatic colors and fantastical creatures around me. The sun shines and energizes my being. This is my inner self, free and whole. All the world's judgments are left on the other side of this dream.

I wake up.
