I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Garden of Whispers**  

I am dreaming.   

The world around me is a watercolor blur at first—soft-edged and shimmering, like light filtering through stained glass. I stand in an endless library, its towering shelves stretching into the velvet darkness above. Books hum with hidden knowledge, their spines pulsing gently, as if breathing. My hands glide across them, hungry, devouring words without pause. But something aches beneath my skin—a hollowness, a neglected pulse.  

Then, the air shifts.  

A single book falls, its pages fluttering open to reveal not text, but roots—living, coiling tendrils that spill onto the marble floor. The ground trembles. Cracks spread like spiderwebs, and through them, emerald vines surge upward, twining around my ankles. They do not restrain; they *invite*.  

The library collapses into the earth, and I am standing in a garden—alive, breathing, *singing*. The trees have voices. Their leaves murmur in a language older than words, and the soil beneath my bare feet is warm, drumming with a slow, steady heartbeat. A stream laughs nearby, its water clear as liquid moonlight, and I realize—*I am thirsty*. Have I forgotten to drink?  

A figure appears—neither man nor woman, but something radiant, woven from dappled sunlight and shadow. They extend a hand, and their touch is cool moss against my skin. *"You have fed your mind,"* they whisper, *"but starved your blood, your bones, your breath."*  

I press my palm to my chest. My heartbeat is sluggish, tired. The garden leans closer, petals brushing my arms like pleading fingers. *"Listen,"* the wind sighs.  

So I do.  

I sink into the grass, let the earth hold me. The stream curls around my wrist, urging me to drink. I do, and the water tastes like laughter. The air fills my lungs like a forgotten melody. Above, the branches sway, and for the first time in what feels like centuries, *I stretch*. Muscle and sinew wake, singing. My mind, so heavy with thought, grows lighter—not empty, but *balanced*.  

The dream dissolves like honey in tea, sweet and golden. As I wake, the echo of the garden lingers in my limbs—a silent vow to remember: wisdom is nothing without the body that carries it.
