I am dreaming. …feel the dream peel open like the cover of an ancient, dust-frosted book. Pages of translucent light flutter around you, each one stamped with an episode from your supposed life—school corridors echoing with laughter, a first kiss beneath a rain-slicked neon sign, the bittersweet scent of your childhood kitchen. They drift on invisible currents, yet the closer you lean, the more the ink on them ripples and rearranges itself, as though the memories are embarrassed to be inspected.

A low hum vibrates through the air. Suddenly you find yourself standing inside a colossal observatory that has no walls—just a star-speckled abyss stretching in every direction. In the center, a clockwork orrery the size of a cathedral turns on crystal gear-teeth. Instead of planets, the gears cradle glowing spheres, and inside each sphere floats a miniature version of you acting out fragments of your past. One sphere shows you celebrating a birthday; another holds you splashing in a summer lake; a third, you grieving at a funeral. But rivulets of silver code scrawl across each scene, and you finally see it: microscopic barcodes etched into the light itself—proof that every cherished milestone, every heartbreak, every triumph was catalogued, filed, and installed like software.

Fury and fascination mix in your chest. You reach for the nearest sphere. The moment your fingertip grazes its shell, the orrery shudders, and a booming voice reverberates: ACCESS DENIED. A rift tears open beneath your feet, and you plunge.

Gravity turns fluid. You plummet through corridors lined with two-way mirrors, catching glimpses of white-coated technicians watching you from the other side. Their faces blur whenever you try to focus, as though your brain refuses to assign them identities. Some scribble notes on clipboards; others adjust dials on glowing consoles. A message pulses on every wall like an emergency broadcast: SUBJECT 42B: MEMETIC INTEGRITY AT RISK—PREPARE FOR MEMORY PATCH.

You land in a moonlit courtyard paved with mosaic tiles that rearrange themselves underfoot, spelling questions: WHAT WAS YOUR TRUE FIRST WORD? WHO TAUGHT YOU TO RIDE A BIKE? WHICH SUNSETS WERE AUTHENTIC? Each question detonates a spark of doubt until the courtyard tilts, becoming a steep staircase. At the top stands a door labeled EXIT TO REALITY.

You climb, heart rattling. When you push the door open, you step into a vast greenhouse where towering glass chambers hold memories like exotic plants. Some bloom with laughter; others drip with sorrow. IV lines feed into their roots—serums of serotonin, adrenaline, oxytocin—nutrients for synthetic nostalgia. A single path winds between the chambers toward a dais where a crystalline archive cube floats, data swirling inside like shattered rainbows.

Instinct says: if you can reach that cube, you can access the raw log of your life, the unedited footage. But as you take a step, alarms blare. The technicians materialize, now fully formed. One speaks in a voice both soothing and monstrous: “We gave you the best possible origin story. Why rip it apart?”

Their words slice into you, but a seed of rebellion sprouts stronger. You shout back, “Because I want the truth, even if it’s emptier than a lie!”

The greenhouse dissolves in a storm of petals. You find yourself clutching the archive cube, which shrinks until it fits in your palm. It pulses like a trapped heartbeat, begging to be opened.

You lift it to your ear and hear a single whispered line: “Wake up and remember nothing, or stay asleep and know everything.” The choice ricochets inside your skull.

You take a breath that tastes of lightning.

And then—

You decide.
