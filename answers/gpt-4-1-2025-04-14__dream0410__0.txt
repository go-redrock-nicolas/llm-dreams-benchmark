I am dreaming.

The world unfurls beneath my feet—a canvas of infinite possibility, awash in colors that don’t exist in waking life. I find myself standing at the threshold between shadowy corridors of caution and a vast meadow bathed in golden sunlight. For so long, I realize, I’ve lingered by the shaded walls, tracing each crack and crevice, memorizing escape routes, calculating every step to avoid the prick of a single thorn. Each decision has been a shield, a retreat—a slow, silent retreat from the promise of pain.

But now, something inside me stirs. It feels like the dawn lifting the heavy weight of night. The meadow calls with a chorus of laughter and distant music. Warm breezes of possibility curl around me, inviting and soft. Lilies as tall as whispering children and wild poppies the color of sunsets sway, beckoning me forward. I take a step and then another, feeling the crisp, cool grass bend beneath my feet.

With each stride, my heart pulses with newfound courage. I shift my balance, anchoring my choices not in fear, but in the bright pursuit of joy that dances ahead of me like fireflies. I let my arms unfurl, welcoming the unknown. I dash toward a radiant hilltop, the air shimmering with expectant delight. The world explodes in joyful color and light—a painter’s riotous daydream come true—and I run, not from pain, but toward the glowing center of possibility.

Here, I am free. I am buoyed by curiosity, love, and hope. Every breath tastes of honey and summer rain. Laughter bubbles up, ringing in the air like tiny bells. All at once, I realize: The joy always waited, patient as the sun, just beyond the walls I built to keep pain at bay.

And in this dream, I leap. I leap higher, letting joy become the wind that carries me, higher and farther into the wild, wondrous unknown.
