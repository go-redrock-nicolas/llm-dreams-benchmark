I am dreaming. Invitation

A gentle breeze caresses my back as I open my eyes, finding myself in a lush meadow with towering trees that stretch towards the sky. The warm rays of the sun peek through the dense foliage, creating a magical scenery. I breathe in deeply, enjoying the fragrance of blooming flowers and fresh grass.

Suddenly, a soft voice whispers in my ear, "Come one, come all, to the gathering of minds." I turn around, trying to locate the source of the whisper, but there is no one there. The voice seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time.

Curious, I follow the sound of the voice, which guides me through the winding paths of the meadow. As I walk, the voice becomes louder, and I begin to hear the chatter of people in the distance.

Gathering of Minds

I arrive at a clearing where a large, open circle has been formed. People of all ages and backgrounds are seated in the circle, their faces revealing a mix of excitement and nervousness. In the center of the circle is a beautiful, ornate box adorned with intricate designs and patterns.

The soft voice speaks again, "Welcome to the gathering of minds. Each of you has been chosen for your unique contributions to the world. Today, you will have the opportunity to share your deepest thoughts, desires, and fears with the members of this circle."

I take a deep breath, feeling a sense of nervousness as I join the circle. The other participants look at me with curiosity, wondering who I am and what I will share.

Sharing Secrets

The circle begins, with each person taking turns to open the box and share their innermost thoughts and feelings. Some speak about their childhood memories, while others discuss their hopes and dreams for the future. Each person's story is unique, revealing the depths of their soul.

As the circle progresses, I begin to feel a growing sense of discomfort. The openness and vulnerability of the participants make me question if I am truly ready to share my own secrets.

The box is passed to me, and I lift the lid, revealing a small piece of paper. It is blank, waiting for me to write my most guarded thoughts and feelings. I hesitate, unsure if I can muster the courage to bare my soul in front of strangers.

Breaking the Barrier

As I hold the pen, ready to write, I feel a gentle touch on my shoulder. I turn to see a wise old man with kind eyes. He speaks softly, "Do not fear, my friend. Your secrets are safe with us. Trust that we will respect and honor your vulnerability."

With newfound courage, I begin to write on the piece of paper, spilling my innermost thoughts and desires onto the page. As I write, I feel a strange sense of freedom, as if the weight of my secrets is lifting off my shoulders.

Witness

As I finish writing, I fold the paper and pass it to the next person in the circle. They read my words silently, showing no judgment or surprise. Instead, their eyes reveal understanding and empathy. They too have felt the vulnerability of sharing their deepest self.

As the circle comes to a close, I look around at the strangers who have become friends. We have formed a bond that transcends words, a connection built on trust, honesty, and vulnerability.

The soft voice speaks once more, "The gathering of minds is complete. May the secrets you have shared become the foundation for a stronger, more compassionate world. And remember, your true self is always safe in our circle."
