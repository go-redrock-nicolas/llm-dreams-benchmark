I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, ethereal library, a place where the air is thick with the scent of ancient parchment and the whispers of forgotten knowledge. The walls are lined with towering bookshelves that stretch up into the darkness, each shelf groaning under the weight of countless tomes. The light here is soft and golden, filtering through stained glass windows that cast colorful patterns on the polished wooden floor.

In the center of the library stands a grand table, its surface carved with intricate designs that seem to shift and change as I look at them. This is where I am supposed to meet the person who triggers strong negative emotions in me, someone I've been avoiding in my waking life. I can feel the tension in my shoulders, the tightness in my jaw, as I wait for them to arrive.

The library is not empty. Ghostly figures flit between the shelves, their forms wavering like heat haze. They seem to be reading the books, their fingers tracing the pages with an almost reverent touch. I watch them, trying to distract myself from the growing unease in my stomach.

Suddenly, the door to the library creaks open, and in walks the person I've been avoiding. They are dressed in a simple white tunic and trousers, their hair a wild mane of dark curls. Their eyes meet mine, and I feel a jolt of something - fear, anger, sadness, all mixed together. I take a deep breath, trying to steady myself.

"Hello," they say, their voice echoing slightly in the vast space. "I've been waiting for you."

I swallow hard, trying to find the words. "I... I don't know why I'm here. I don't understand why you make me feel this way."

They smile sadly, their eyes reflecting the golden light. "Because we have a history, you and I. A history that's been forgotten, but it's still there, deep down. It's like a ghost in this library, haunting us both."

I look around, feeling the weight of their words. The ghostly figures seem to be watching us, their eyes filled with curiosity and concern. I take a step forward, my heart pounding in my chest.

"What history?" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.

They reach into their pocket and pull out a small, leather-bound book. "This," they say, holding it out to me. "This is our history. It's time we read it together."

I hesitate, my hand hovering over the book. I can feel the emotions churning inside me, a maelstrom of fear and anger and sadness. But I also feel a spark of something else - curiosity, maybe even a glimmer of hope.

I take the book from them, my fingers brushing against their skin. A jolt of electricity runs through me, and I look up, meeting their gaze. In that moment, I see something in their eyes - a vulnerability, a longing. It's a look I've never seen before, and it makes me want to reach out, to touch them, to understand.

But I don't. Instead, I open the book, the pages creaking softly as they unfold. The words are written in a language I don't understand, but as I look at them, the meaning becomes clear. It's a story of love and loss, of betrayal and redemption. It's our story.

I look up from the book, my eyes meeting theirs. "Let's read it together," I say, my voice steady and sure. And as we sit down at the grand table, the light of the stained glass windows casting a warm glow over us, I know that this is just the beginning. The beginning of our journey, of our history, of our truth.
