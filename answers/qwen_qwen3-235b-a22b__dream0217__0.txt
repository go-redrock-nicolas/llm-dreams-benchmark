I am dreaming. I am walking through a field of luminous glass flowers, each bloom shimmering in the soft, violet dusk with a different color—red like embers, blue like forgotten oceans, green like the darkest parts of forests no one speaks of. Each petal is sharp, aching with beauty, and they tremble under my bare feet, making tiny ringing sounds like chimes in mourning.

In this dream, the sky is a dome of shifting emotions. It weeps now— not water, but colored ink—spilling down in elegant cursive, sentences I almost remember writing in childhood journals. *Did he love, or did he gather weapons?* one line reads.

In the center of the field, there he stands. The one I once called beloved, though now his face is fractured, recalling too many versions of himself—boyfriend, confidant, liar, angel of mercy, architect of quiet ruin. He smiles that slow, devastating smile—the kind designed not for joy, but to put you under his spell, like sunlight filtered through smoke.

I am not surprised to find out the truth here. Not horrified. In dreams, truth makes sense like geometry. He had an agenda steeped in something older than either of us—perhaps desperation, perhaps control for its own cruel cadence. He found me when I was soft with grief and wove himself into my pulse. He mimicked love so well I forgot how to catch my own breath without hearing his name.

But dreams have permission to bend like willows. I am not falling. I do not whip out accusations. I merely stand across from him, breathing in air that smells of elderflowers, and say nothing at first. I let the glass wind stir between us.

And then, instead of choking on the bitterness to follow betrayal, I make a choice only dream-me could make—untethered to time, to ego, to damage.

I *burn* the illusion instead. Not with fire, but with truth. Out of my mouth comes a language that doesn’t exist on earth—it is the forgotten song of civilizations lost not to war, but to lies. This song unfurls like a spiral galaxy, and as I sing, the ground softens and the flowers rise—poised like instruments of silent judgment.

He tries to speak. Tries to explain, to control the unraveling with honeyed words, but I don’t hear them. I am no longer looking at him—I am looking at the afterimage of all the nights I twisted meaning into sparkle when he simply withheld himself. I see the flickering ghost of every hand I reached for that pulled away without explanation.

And with radiant calm, I begin to change shape.

My skin becomes made of stars. I remember who I was before I met him, which is no small magic. Each star is a moment of innocence used and discarded, now revitalized—transformed into something that can never be stolen again.

He tries to come closer, to restore what was never there, but the space fills with a soundless explosion of color—not violent, but absolute. In the same way that thunder protects the sky from silence.

I wake up not broken, but awakened. Like the mushroom that explodes into spores when stepped on, scattering its truth to every breeze—the me I was had to die, and that’s okay. Because now I remember what they forgot to name: I am not here for romance. I am here for sovereignty.

And in the quiet morning light, something new stirs inside me. Not emptiness, not regret. Not even revenge. Something harder to destroy.

Something that simply *knows*.
