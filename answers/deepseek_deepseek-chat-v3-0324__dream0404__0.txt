I am dreaming. **The Dream:**  

The air hums with a thick, golden haze, like suspended pollen in a beam of sunlight—but here, the light comes from everywhere and nowhere all at once. You stand in a vast, circular hall with no ceiling, only an endless swirl of indigo and violet skies streaked with shooting stars that blink like distant signals. The floor is a mosaic of shifting patterns, tiles rearranging themselves with each step, whispering secrets in a language just beyond comprehension.  

Around you, two groups have gathered, their silhouettes outlined in faint halos of opposing hues—one bathed in cool, silvery light, the other in warm, flickering amber. Their voices reach you not as sound, but as vibrations in the air, shaping the space around them: with every word, glassy filaments extend between them, thickening into crystalline threads that tremble with tension.  

**The Topic?** Something immovable, something sacred to both. A truth that lives in the marrow of their bones, woven into their dreams and fears. It crackles between them like static before a storm.  

You raise your hands, not to silence, but to sculpt. The air yields like wet clay, parting to form a shared space—a pool of liquid mercury in the center, reflecting not their faces, but their core desires, their unspoken wounds.  

One steps forward, eyes burning with conviction. "You don't understand," they say, and the words materialize as a rope of thorns. The other recoils, then exhales. The thorns soften into vines, heavy with ripe fruit.  

"You're right," they murmur. "I don’t. But I want to."  

A hush. The filaments glow brighter.  

The pool ripples—now showing not opposition, but parallax: the same vision from two angles, separated by the curvature of time, of experience. Someone gasps. A thread of silver light darts between them, fragile but unbroken.  

Above, the stars pulse in approval. The ground beneath you sighs, and for the first time—though no words of agreement have been spoken—the hall smells like rain after a long drought.  

You smile. The dream deepens.
