I am dreaming. You are dreaming. A choir of floating glyphs hums in shades of cobalt and gold around you, illuminating a vast chamber whose walls ripple like liquid mercury. At the center of the room stands the Aurora Nexus—an impossibly intricate device of interwoven filaments, crystalline nodes, and softly pulsing conduits. Scientists in iridescent labcoats drift around its perimeter, their faces ghostly in the ambient glow. They exchange urgent whispers you can’t quite catch.  

You’ve never so much as seen a diagram of the Nexus before, let alone learned to operate one. And now, with no training but all eyes on you expectantly, you step into the circle of light. Your pulse echoes in your ears. The Nexus thrums, as though it recognizes your unsteady hand.  

You raise your arm, and a slender tool materializes in your grasp—a twisting, glass-like instrument that feels alive, humming against your palm. On the far side of the machine, three crystalline pods hover, each dripping rivulets of shimmering plasma. Your task: to align the pods with the gravity-stabilizing coils, calibrate the flux resonators, and ignite the core without triggering a cascade meltdown that could rend the very fabric of this cathedral in two.  

You swallow and draw in a trembling breath. Time slows. Somewhere behind you, the hum shifts into a single, pure note—a siren call beneath your ribs. You close your eyes.  

In that instant, fractured memories flood your mind: the half-remembered physics lecture you once nodded off in, a childhood puzzle of interlocking gears, the lullaby of rain tapping on a windowpane. Your fingers begin to move of their own accord. The glass tool bends and curves, amplifying your intention. You guide the first crystalline pod into place; it snaps into the coil with a sound like distant thunder. Sparks of violet fire arc along its surface.  

Now the second pod, its plasma swirling like molten sunsets, demands delicate coaxing. You index the resonator dials with your free hand, feeling their weightless click. The pod locks in—and the Nexus shudders, as if catching its breath. Around you, the spectators’ murmurs crescendo into a single held exhale.  

Only one pod remains. Its surface quivers, alive with unstable energies that sing at the edge of madness. You steady your racing heart, reach out, and let your intuition carry you: turning a dial three-quarters to the right, then half-a-turn back, until the hum resolves into something harmonious. As wire-fine ripples of light dance across the final pod, you press it gently into place.  

For a heartbeat the chamber goes silent. Then—like the slow dawn of a new world—the Nexus awakens. Vivid beams of prismatic light cascade upward, slicing through the rippling walls. The air ripples with warmth, the hum blossoms into a triumphant chord, and the assembled experts break into awed applause.  

You step back, trembling but triumphant, feeling the soft glow of the Nexus wash over you. Somewhere deep inside, you know you crossed the boundary between the impossible and the achieved. And then—just as suddenly as it began—the dream melts away, leaving you suspended on the brink of waking, your heart thrumming with remembered wonder.
