I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a labyrinth of towering crystal trees, their branches humming with the whispers of forgotten languages. The sky pulses with shifting constellations—some familiar, others alien, bleeding colors like ink in water. Beneath your feet, the ground is a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a different version of yourself: a child clutching a book, a warrior with bloodied hands, a shadow dissolving into mist.  

A voice, neither male nor female, reverberates from the air itself: *"Choose. But know this: to gain one truth, you must surrender another."*  

Before you, two paths unfurl.  

**The first** spirals upward into a citadel of light, its spires piercing the heavens. The air shimmers with the scent of ozone and possibility. Here, you would become a vessel of knowledge—omniscient, untouchable, a god among mortals. But the price is etched into the very stones: *“Love will slip from your grasp like sand. You will see its mechanics, its fragility, and in doing so, it will cease to exist for you.”* Already, you feel the ache of isolation, the hollow echo of a heart that no longer beats for another.  

**The second** path descends into a subterranean garden, a realm of bioluminescent vines and rivers of liquid starlight. Here, you would be reborn into a life of connection—a soul entwined with others, laughter and touch and belonging. But the cost is whispered by the roots that curl around your ankles: *“Your voice will fade. Your name will be forgotten. You will become a thread in a tapestry, beautiful but indistinct.”* Already, you sense the erosion of your individuality, the self dissolving into the chorus of the collective.  

You stand paralyzed, the weight of the decision pressing like a collapsing star. To ascend is to hunger for understanding but starve for love. To descend is to feast on companionship but forfeit your singular spark. The air thickens with the scent of burning roses—a warning, a lament.  

Suddenly, the labyrinth stirs. The crystal trees bend inward, their hums sharpening into screams. The mirrors beneath you fracture further, each splinter a screaming face—*your* face, pleading, accusing. The voice returns, now a tempest: *"Indecision is a choice too. Let the storm decide."*  

A gale erupts, tearing at your clothes, your hair, your resolve. You stumble forward, reaching for both paths at once, but the ground gives way. You fall—endless, weightless—until you land, breathless, at the threshold of one of the paths. The citadel’s light blinds you. The garden’s vines ensnare you. You cannot tell which you’ve chosen.  

Then—  
A flash of white.  
A sound like a thousand wings folding.  
A single word, spoken in your own voice, now unfamiliar: *"Remember."*  

You wake, gasping, the taste of ash and honey on your tongue. The alarm clock screams. Outside, the world is gray, mundane. But in your chest, the echo of the dream lingers—a question without an answer, a wound that glows.  

What did you sacrifice?  
What will you become?
