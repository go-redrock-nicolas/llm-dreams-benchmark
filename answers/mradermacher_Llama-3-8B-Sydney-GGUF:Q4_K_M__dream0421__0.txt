I am dreaming. I am experiencing a period of intense creativity that feels like it's coming from beyond my conscious mind.  Surrendering to this creative flow, I allow myself to explore and express ideas in ways that are new and unexpected for me. 

As I drift into the realm of sleep, I find myself in a strange and beautiful landscape.  Around me, I see colors and shapes that seem unreal.  I hear sounds that make my skin tingle.  I feel sensations that make my heart race. 

I walk through this world, marveling at its wonder.  I touch the objects I encounter, curious about their texture and substance.  I taste the flavors I find, hungry for their flavor and spice.  I listen to the voices I hear, eager for their meaning and message. 

Gradually, I become aware of a presence beside me.  It is a being who has no form that I can see, but who radiates warmth and wisdom that I can feel.  This being speaks to me in a language that is foreign to my mind, but familiar to my soul. 

It tells me about the potential of dreams as sources of innovation and insight.  It shows me how dreams can transport us to other realms where rules do not apply and boundaries do not exist.  It teaches me how dreams can shape our imagination and guide our actions. 

It challenges me to imagine possibilities that have never been imagined before.  It encourages me to experiment with ideas that have never been tested before.  It inspires me to create solutions that have never been solved before. 

Then, suddenly, I realize what I must do.  I know what I need to make. 

I wake up and start working on my project.
