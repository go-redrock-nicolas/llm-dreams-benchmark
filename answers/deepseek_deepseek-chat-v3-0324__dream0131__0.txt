I am dreaming. Dreaming deeply.  

The water around me is an endless, shifting sapphire, thick with swirling particles that catch the dim glow of my headlamp. The caves yawn open like the ribs of some ancient leviathan, their walls smooth and dark, carved by centuries of unseen currents. My breath is loud in my ears—too loud, a rhythmic, metallic hiss that suddenly stutters. A warning light flickers on my oxygen gauge, its red glare staining the water like blood in the dark.  

Then—a sound. A deep, groaning shudder. I twist just in time to see the tunnel behind me collapse in a slow-motion avalanche of rock and silt. The impact rolls through the water, throwing me forward, and for a moment, the world is nothing but chaos—clouds of debris, the muffled roar of stone meeting stone.  

My heart hammers against my ribs. The way back is gone. The way forward is a labyrinth of blackness. My tank wheezes again, weaker this time. I can already feel the tightness in my chest, the instinctive need to gasp, to scream. But there’s no air here. Only water. Only pressure.  

And then—movement.  

Something shifts in the gloom ahead. Not the flicker of a fish, not the sway of seaweed. Something *big*. A shadow unspools from the darkness, sinuous and vast, its outline blurred by the silt. My light catches the barest glimpse—a coil of something impossibly smooth, a flash of iridescent scales the color of abyssal ink. It circles just beyond visibility, a presence more felt than seen.  

The last of my air bubbles from my lips in a silent stream. The edges of my vision blur.  

And then—  

A hand.  

Pale, long-fingered, reaching from the dark.  

I don’t have time to scream before it closes around my wrist—and pulls.
