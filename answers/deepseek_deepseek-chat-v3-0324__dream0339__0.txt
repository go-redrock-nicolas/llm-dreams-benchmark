I am dreaming. *The colors around me are impossibly vivid, shifting like liquid stained glass in sunlight. A peal of laughter escapes my lips—uncontrollable, giddy, as if joy is bubbling up from some hidden wellspring within. The air itself hums with warmth, carrying the scent of ripe apricots and the faintest hint of ozone, like the moment before a summer thunderstorm.*

Beneath my bare feet, the ground isn’t dirt or grass but something soft and yielding—a carpet of moss, perhaps? No, it pulses faintly, glowing with bioluminescence in hues of turquoise and violet. I wiggle my toes and watch as tiny sparks of light rise with each movement, dispersing like fireflies into the lavender-tinted sky. 

Ahead of me, impossibly tall dandelions sway despite the absence of wind, their fluffy seed heads the size of my fists, each filament tipped with a diamond droplet of dew. Reaching out, I brush one, and it dissolves into a thousand tiny fractals of light, swirling in hypnotic patterns before reforming into the shape of a silver-blue butterfly. The creature alights on my palm, its wings whispering secrets in a language I *almost* understand—like remembering the tail end of a forgotten lullaby.

Someone is calling my name—not a voice, exactly, but the *idea* of one, reverberating through the trees that now arch overhead. Their branches are gilded with fruits that look like polished amber, pulsing gently as if breathing. I pluck one, and juice spills over my fingers, impossibly sweet, tasting of warmth and nostalgia. For a fleeting second, I know—*absolutely know*—that this is the taste of childhood summers, of bike rides at dusk, of snowflakes melting on my tongue. 

The joy crests inside me, bright as a supernova, and I run forward without knowing where I’m going. The landscape keeps shifting: cobblestones appear beneath me, carved with constellations that rearrange themselves as I pass. A bridge materializes ahead, woven from strands of starlight, spanning a river where the water flows upward in crystalline ribbons. Laughter spills from me again, and the sound crystallizes in the air—tiny, chiming notes that flutter like leaves before dissolving. 

This is the dream—one where happiness isn’t an emotion but a *place*, and I am home. 

(When you wake, the taste of amber lingers on your tongue, and your fingers twitch, chasing the phantom weight of wings.)
