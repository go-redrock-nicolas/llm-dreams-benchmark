I am dreaming.

I stand on a massive landing platform perched high above a sprawling metropolis beneath a crimson sky. The city’s once-glittering towers, glinting with thousands of mirrored windows, now shudder under ominous shockwaves that reverberate like thunder with no visible lightning. The air around me feels charged and electric, tinged with a metallic taste that coats my tongue each time I inhale.

Spread before me on the platform is a chaos of panicked citizens, hastily gathering meager belongings and pushing frantically toward the fleet of airships hovering overhead. Their roaring engines spew plumes of azure flames, reflecting off the safety harnesses extended for evacuees. Each ship flickers with dazzling neon patterns, a protective shimmer hinting at experimental technology designed to safeguard those onboard against the unknown force sweeping through the city’s unlit corridors.

Everyone expects me to know what to do. I’m surrounded by a ragged team of first responders, all sporting tattered jumpsuits emblazoned with insignias that have grown as meaningless as the protocols we once followed. Alarms drill into our ears—long, shrill sirens that build with smoldering intensity, warning us this is more than a natural disaster or mechanical failure. People’s faith in the old regulations has buckled under the weight of a new reality: standard-issue evacuation routes are crumbling, while shelters that once offered steadfast safety have become perilous traps.

We try to guide throngs of people toward the best possible options. Yet with every passing second, the ground splits and roils beneath the city blocks, trembling with a force that might burst forth at any moment. A woman in a reflective cloak tugs at my arm, tears streaming down a soot-smeared face as she points frantically to a collapsed monorail track behind her. She pleads for my help—her voice cracking beyond words—imploring me to guide her family to the nearest flight bay. I swallow my rising panic, remembering the new directive: gather them in smaller groups, feed them into the lower cargo holds of the safer ships, and pray their structural integrity holds.

Ignoring the outdated crisis drills hammered into my head, I wave a combination of hand signals agreed upon just minutes ago, urging my team to split the crowd into smaller pods—each assigned to a specific ship. It’s an attempt to bypass the gridlock that reigned moments earlier when all the evacuees converged on the primary bay doors.

Just then, a tremor rips through the platform beneath my feet, bending the metal supports as if they were paper. Screams ricochet in the thick, stifled air. In the distance, I see monstrous silhouettes looming against the horizon, half-obscured by a blanket of swirling red fog. They might be enormous drones malfunctioning in flight, or something more… alive. For a moment, they appear to converge on the platform, as though drawn by the anguish of the masses.

Over the roars of afterburners and the cries of frightened families, I call out the next steps: funnel survivors onto the cargo barges stationed at the minor docking points. Even though they’re slower, less elegant crafts, they remain stable under immense pressure—maybe they’ll get through what’s coming next. The more advanced, lightning-fast dropships are prone to short bursts of speed, but I’ve seen them fail catastrophically if the turbulence spikes too high.

I watch as clusters of people, guided by searchlights set into small, handheld devices, begin their scramble aboard these lumbering transports. The beams form trembling pillars of sharp-white against the swirling gloom. It’s as if each marking illuminates a sacred path through this crumbling reality. Sometimes, though, the light falls onto craters in the platform floor, revealing jagged edges where the city’s underpinnings have collapsed.

I’m suddenly reminded of another, deeper dread. I recall rumors of an experimental reactor lying somewhere beneath the city’s labyrinthine sewer systems—if it is damaged, the repercussions might make all other threats pale by comparison. Time is slipping through my fingers like stardust. Despite the agonizing weight of it, something sparks inside me: the primal will to adapt and survive. Abandoning the old scripts, I order my team to rig emergency lines descending into the lower tunnels, where we can shut down the reactor or prevent further meltdown.

At the platform’s edge, I turn one last time and lock eyes with a teenage boy, his eyes wide with terror and hope. It’s as if in that fleeting glance, we share an understanding that everything we do is for one another. Gripping my harness, I leap over the rail, plummeting toward the smoking underbelly of the city, where flickers of scarlet energy bleed into the blackness.

As I freefall, I see the rescue ships—bulky silhouettes against the fire-hued skyline—lifting off with a rumbling bellow into the swirling clouds. They carry pockets of humanity clinging to a whisper of safety, leaving behind a ghostly silhouette of a city too grand and too fragile. My heart pounds in my ears as I descend, a reminder that the dream is mine to command, to rewrite destiny when all protocols fail.

Everything blurs. In the dream’s fragile haze, I’m certain of one thing: despite the imminent catastrophe, a resilient spark of hope lingers. The old rules may have broken, but our resolve remains firm. And as the dream rages on, I continue to lead, forging new paths where none existed, fueled by the desperate promise of survival.
