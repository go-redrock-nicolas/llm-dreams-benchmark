I am dreaming. The world around me shifts and blurs, pigmenting itself anew with hues that seem to shimmer with their own light. I find myself standing in a vast, ancient library, its grand library the colour of a stormy twilight sky, studded with constellations of golden specks that seem to twinkle like distant stars. The air is filled with the comforting scent of aged paper and whispers of forgotten knowledge. As I walk further in, the silence is neither empty nor oppressive, but heavy with a thousand stories waiting to be unfolded.

I notice a peculiar object floating gently in the space before me, resembling a shimmering, iridescent font of alphabetical runoff. It seems to pulse with life, the letters shifting into symbols, then words, then murmurs, as if conversing amongst themselves in a language I can't comprehend, yet somehow feel akin to. A sense of tranquility washes over me; I know this is the source of my newfound intuition, buffering at its edges, eager to spill into my consciousness.

The floor beneath my feet begins to ripple, not with water, but with knowledge. Vast streams of data, experiences, insights, slice through the marbled stone, kaleidoscopic patterns reflecting off its surface. As I stand there, I feel the world's collective wisdom surging into me. It's overwhelming, yet thrilling, like standing under a waterfall of comprehension, the icy water leeching every last vestige of confusion from my mind.

Suddenly, I'm in the heart of a bustling city, yet everything around me is shades of ultraviolet, visible only to my new sense. I see patterns, understand motives, anticipate outcomes. I can see the subtle manipulator, the hidden prophet, the silent philanthropist. Every choice, every action, every consequence, it's all laid out before me like a map.

In response to my inner consciousness screaming for balance, the world slows, then stops altogether. Time itself is paused, waiting, watching. A whisper, barely audible, echoes through space, "What action brings the greatest good?" I know the answer before the question is even fully formed. My intuition, this new guide, this supernatural compass, points me to the exact path.

Yet, I don't feel like a robot following commands. I feel alive, more than I ever have. I am still me, yet enhanced, like a instrument tuned to its peak. The potential is limitless, the possibilities endless. I am ready.

Then, I wake up. I find myself sitting up in bed, heart pounding in my chest, every cell in my body buzzing with a new vigour, a new purpose. I know the world has changed. I've changed. And I'm ready to face whatever comes next.
