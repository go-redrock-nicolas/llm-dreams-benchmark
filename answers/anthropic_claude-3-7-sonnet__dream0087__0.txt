I am dreaming. I'm seated at a round table of polished mahogany, its surface reflecting the amber light from antique sconces that line the walls of a room both familiar and strange. The ceiling stretches impossibly high above me, wooden beams crisscrossing into infinity. Around the table sit shadowy figures whose features shift between those of strangers and people I've known my entire life—cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents—some of whom I recognize from faded photographs but have never met.

The dispute centers around an inheritance—not just of money or property, but of stories, of truths, of the very narrative of who our family is. An ancient leather-bound book sits at the center of the table, its pages yellowed and fragile, containing genealogies that branch and twist like living things.

"That land was stolen," hisses a woman whose face alternates between youth and age with each blink of my eyes. "Grandfather took it during the troubles."

"He saved it!" counters an elderly man whose voice carries the weight of mountains. "Without him, there would be nothing left for any of us!"

The air grows thick with unspoken accusations. Family portraits on the walls seem to lean in, listening, their eyes following the conversation. I feel the weight of generations on my shoulders as I try to find words that might heal rather than wound.

When voices begin to rise like a brewing storm, the chandelier above begins to tremble. Crystal teardrops tinkle ominously. The temperature drops suddenly, and I notice frost forming along the edges of water glasses.

"Please," I begin, raising my hands, but the hostility crescendos. Someone stands, shouting words that sting like sleet. Another responds with equal fury. The book at the center begins to bleed ink onto the table, black tendrils spreading across the polished surface.

Suddenly, the walls of the room begin to breathe—expanding and contracting like lungs. The family members don't notice, too consumed by their rage, but I watch in horrified fascination as portraits melt into the wallpaper, and the ceiling opens to reveal not sky but an endless library of untold stories stretching into darkness.

I realize with dreamlike clarity that this isn't just about healing one family's wounds—I'm mediating between past and future, between memory and truth, between what we choose to remember and what we bury...
