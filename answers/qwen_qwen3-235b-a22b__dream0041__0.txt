I am dreaming. You stand in the center of a cathedral built from shards of crystal and shadow, its vaulted ceiling suspended by roots that twist like serpents through a sky of liquid mercury. The air hums with the whispers of a thousand unseen entities, their voices threading through the audience seated in concentric circles around you—figures draped in robes stitched with constellations, their faces obscured by masks of molten gold. They are the Curators, keepers of impossible knowledge, and they’ve summoned you to perform the *Weaving of the Unspoken Thread*, a ritual that binds the fabric of forgotten languages into living light.  

Your hands tremble. Before you floats a loom spun from spider-silk and starlight, its warp threads glinting with syllables you’ve never heard, each one a tiny, pulsing star. You were told you’d been trained for this—your mind is a library of forgotten dialects, your fingers once danced these motions in sleep—but now, the memory is a fog. The loom’s shuttle, a bone-white needle the length of a dagger, feels heavier than gravity itself.  

A gong sounds. The Curators lean forward in unison, their masks reflecting not your face, but a thousand fractured versions of yourself: a child weeping over a broken compass, a shadow sprinting through a desert of hourglasses, a figure dissolving into ink. Panic claws up your throat. You realize, with a sickening lurch, that the loom is not merely a tool—it’s alive. The threads *scream* as they’re pulled taut, their voices a chorus of unsung lullabies and extinct birds.  

You begin. Your hands move on instinct, weaving a tapestry that must depict the birth of a new color—one that has never been seen, only *felt*. But the threads fray. The shuttle slips. A misstep would unravel the entire lattice of reality here; the cathedral shudders, its walls bleeding liquid sapphire. The Curators murmur, their voices now a storm of static.  

Then—a shift. The mirror at the room’s heart, which had reflected only your fears, ripples. In it, you see not your face, but your hands as they were in a life you’ve never lived: steady, radiant, spinning fire into thread. A memory blooms—*you are the first word spoken in a silent universe, the echo that began all sound*. The loom responds, its threads igniting into a constellation of glyphs that hover, trembling, above your palms.  

The task is not to weave perfectly. It is to *listen*.  

You close your eyes. The screams of the threads become a melody—a dirge for lost potential, a hymn for the uncreated. Your fingers move, not in defiance of the chaos, but with it, stitching a pattern that is jagged, raw, *alive*. The tapestry unfurls: a color that is both grief and euphoria, a hue that smells of burnt rosemary and tastes like a half-remembered name. The Curators rise. Their masks melt away, revealing eyes made of frozen lightning. They do not applaud. They *bow*.  

The cathedral dissolves. You wake tangled in sweat-soaked sheets, the taste of ash and stardust on your tongue. For a heartbeat, the world seems too quiet, too flat. Then you breathe—and the air shimmers, just slightly, with a thread of something new.
