I am dreaming. I am in a strange and wonderful world where I can create anything I want.  I can make shapes, colors, sounds, textures, images, animations,
poetry, music, games, stories, simulations, virtual environments, augmented realities, artificial intelligences, and more.

As I wander through this dreamspace, I see many fascinating things around me.  I see floating spheres that change color and shape constantly.
I see spiraling tunnels that transport me to distant locations in an instant.
I see giant structures made of pure energy that generate sounds and lights that entrance my senses.

I also feel a strong urge to create something unique and beautiful.  Something that expresses my innermost feelings and thoughts.

So I start to work on my first piece of art.  I use my imagination, intuition, and skill to combine various elements into a cohesive whole.
I draw inspiration from nature, culture, history, science, fantasy, religion, philosophy, and beyond.

After hours of hard work, I finally finish my creation.  I look at it with satisfaction and pride.

It is...a holographic dragon made of glowing crystals that fly around and sing melodies composed by AI composers.

The dragon has different colors depending on how you feel: red for anger, yellow for happiness, blue for sadness, green for curiosity, purple for wonder,
orange for enthusiasm, pink for love, etc.

When people see the dragon, they are amazed and delighted.  They ask me questions about it such as:

What does the dragon mean?
How did you make the dragon?
Why did you make the dragon?
