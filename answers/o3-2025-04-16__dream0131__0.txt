I am dreaming. …brace yourself against the shuddering stone, the reverberations of the cave-in still humming through your bones. Gritty silt swirls past your mask in frantic, glittering spirals, and the beam of your dive light wobbles as your hands tremble. The pressure gauge on your tank dips into the orange. You have twelve—maybe ten—breaths left.

Think.

The tunnel you came through is buried beneath a jagged barricade of basalt slabs. Every inhale tastes thinner, drier, echoing louder in your ears. But then—just beyond the rubble, through a latticework of cracks—you glimpse a faint, moving glow. Electric-blue, like moonlight shattered into flecks. Something lives or flickers out there.

With a sudden, reckless resolve you palm your dive knife and wedge its blunt spine into one of the smaller gaps. The rock groans but your blade finds leverage; a slab shifts and a gush of cold, silken water slides through. A school of dime-sized fish, all crystalline and pulsing with bioluminescence, pours in around your wrists. They don’t flee—you realize they’re hovering, tasting the vibration of your heartbeat. Your air gauge sinks nearer red.

The fish drift aside as if inviting you. Beyond them a slim fissure gapes just wide enough for a desperate diver.

You exhale to shrink your chest, squeeze through—and the cave seems to inhale you in return. The stone corridor opens into a vast atrium, a cathedral of submerged stalactites reaching down like the teeth of some ancient leviathan. Shafts of aquamarine light pour from vents in the ceiling rock, as though the ocean above has become liquid stained-glass. Great columns rise, coated in swaying gardens of violet sea-fern and spider-silk coral. The little blue fish spiral upward in a choreographed tornado, dispersing into hanging constellations.

Your lungs ache. Seven breaths now.

Then you see it: a bubble of air trapped beneath a slanted overhang, its mirror-smooth surface catching the glimmer of the cave like mercury. You kick hard, discard your regulator, and pop your head up into the chamber. Air—cold, mineral, and tinged with ozone—rushes into you. You cough, gasp, laugh all at once, the sound echoing like chimes. Your pulse steadies, though your heart still drums an urgent cadence against your ribs.

When the dizziness fades, you notice symbols scorched into the rock above the pocket—spirals, eyes, wave-glyphs that feel impossibly deliberate. This place was found before, by someone—or something—who could breathe just as you do now.

Your light sweeps the cavern. A ridge juts outward on the far wall, almost like a balcony. Behind it, a narrow chimney rises, bubbles winking up its ribbed interior. Could be a vertical escape route. Could be death. Dreams don’t offer guarantees.

A strange calm overtakes you, the same lucid hush that precedes every shifting scene in a dream. You close your eyes, count to five, plunge back under, and fin toward the chimney. Halfway, your beam flickers, dies—battery gone. But the darkness blooms with other luminescences: threads of emerald plankton, ribbons of rose-gold jelly. They twine around your arms, lighting the way themselves, like living constellations fastening to a voyager’s mast.

The chimney pinches near the middle. You contort sideways, your tank scraping stone, regulator hissing. Ahead, daylight—a pale, ghostly disk. Your muscles burn, but gravity feels reversed, as if the water is urging you on, exhaling you up.

A final kick, and you breach.

You burst into an open lagoon, roofed only by tattered lacework arches of rock. Sunrays slice through the water, breaking into prisms; the limestone walls glow honey-amber. Wind sighs overhead. You spit out your mouthpiece, gulp fresh air as if it were liquid gold.

And then—you notice the silence of the surface. No boat engines, no gulls, only your pulse and the slow drip of distant stalactites liquefying time. You float on your back. Clouds drift above but every shape feels ever-so-slightly impossible—an elephant with moth wings, a clock that melts then reforms, mountains upside-down. Because this is the moment in the dream when logic loosens its belt.

Something huge stirs below. You peer down through the crystalline water: a shadow the size of a cathedral glides beneath you, patterned in luminous runes that mirror the glyphs you saw inside. It rolls one massive eye up toward you—an eye the color of sunrise seen through smoke—and in that orb you glimpse not menace but invitation, an old, impossible intelligence. The gentle vortex of its passing pulls you in a slow circle, never tugging you under, merely keeping you company.

“What are you?” you whisper, not sure if your voice escapes air or mind.

A thought—clear as struck crystal—replies: Keeper of Thresholds.

The creature drifts toward a submerged archway on the lagoon’s edge, its runes blossoming brighter. Currents beckon. Behind the arch, the sea fades into a velvet realm of stars—an impossible cosmos beneath the waves.

You realize the dream is folding into yet another layer; one more door before you wake. Your fear has boiled away, distilled into curiosity. You tighten the straps of your half-empty tank, take a grateful lungful of the realest unreal air you’ve ever tasted, and trail the Keeper into the illuminated mouth of the stars. The water grows warm, then weightless, then indistinguishable from night sky itself.

You kick once, twice, and the dark listens.

You wake—heart still humming with tides, lungs brimming with phantom salt—and for a moment, in the hush between dream and daylight, you swear you can taste starlight on your tongue.
