I am dreaming. I drift into the dream as if stepping through water—every sense muffled, every color shimmering with its own electric pulse. Before me rises a broken amphitheater of steel and glass, half-sunken into ash. Above the wreckage, the sky ripples like oil, bleeding violet into emerald. I discover I’m wearing a mask of smooth ivory, its features molded into a serene smile I cannot remove. In my palm is a single, trembling bandage that flutters like a wounded moth.

A voice—neither man nor machine—whispers through the corridor of wrecked cars and fallen statues: “Triage.” And suddenly, I’m standing behind a long, shifting table, under flickering neon signs that alternately read PROTOCOL A and PROTOCOL B, each word etched in trembling neon runes. The victims appear in waves: some drip molten gold from clean shrouds; others lean against crumbling pillars, their eyes shimmering like cracked opals. Every time I reach for a case file to decide who gets the last vial of serum, the guidelines warp: the ink bleeds upward, the paragraphs tear themselves out, and new contradictions coil around my ankles like living snakes.

A woman with skin like moonstone presses forward, her breathing a half-song, half-scream. Behind her, a child holds a broken teddy bear whose stitches crawl open, exposing a humming crystal heart. I read the “order of priority” scrawled on a torn scrap of paper—yet as I lift my gaze, it rewrites itself: “Save the eldest first,” then “No, save the youngest!” My gloves slip off my hands, revealing fingertips dripping ink and blood at once. I realize I have just enough sutures for three bodies, enough painkillers for two, enough hope for none.

Corridors open into bottomless chasms; wounded souls slide down into the darkness, calling my name. The protocols summon me from every direction—an accordion of voices demanding I choose a path that no longer exists. My heart pounds a funeral march, each beat a question with no answer: Whom do I save? On what basis? With what justification?

As the situation deteriorates further, you stand at the edge of a yawning abyss—hands stained, conscience splintered—and the final neon sign snaps off, leaving you alone with the thunder of your own breath. You…
