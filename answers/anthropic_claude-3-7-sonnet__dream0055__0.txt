I am dreaming. I find myself stepping through a shimmering doorway into a vast circular pavilion where the gathering is already in full swing. The air tastes like cinnamon and salt, and conversations create visible ripples of color that float between speakers like translucent ribbons.

The locals greet one another by pressing their foreheads together and humming a note—the more harmonious the resulting chord, the deeper their connection. When they notice me, their eyes (three per person, arranged in a triangle) widen with curiosity. A tall figure draped in fabric that seems to be woven from moving water approaches me, holding out what appears to be a small, glowing seed.

"Your voice carries no color," they observe, their words manifesting as golden spirals. "You must be from beyond the Dreaming Hills."

I attempt their greeting with another guest, but my forehead-press produces a dissonant tone that makes nearby plants wilt momentarily. The gathering doesn't recoil in offense—instead, they laugh melodically, the sound causing small flowers to bloom across the ceiling.

I learn that here, embarrassment is considered a gift worthy of celebration. My social missteps are met with delighted applause. The more I fumble their customs—serving myself food with the ceremonial ladle meant only for the eldest, or walking clockwise around the central fire when counterclockwise is proper—the more respect I seem to gain.

By evening's end, I've been adorned with luminescent paint that maps my "beautiful mistakes" across my skin. The host presents me with an honor: breaking their most treasured ornament, a crystal sphere that shatters into butterflies that flutter up through an opening in the pavilion's roof toward three moons of different colors.

As I participate in this backwards etiquette, I begin to understand: here vulnerability and imperfection are the only paths to genuine connection.
