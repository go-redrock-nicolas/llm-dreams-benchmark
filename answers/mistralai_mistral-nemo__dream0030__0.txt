I am dreaming. I am walking through the vast, open expanse of a golden wheat field, the sun aarako an orange giant dipping languidly towards the horizon. Each stalk of wheat whispers secrets to its neighbor as they sway rhythmically in the gentle breeze, their collective rustle a symphony that's both soothing and invigorating. The ripe, golden harvest stretches out in waves before me, all the way to the indigo hills that frame the idyllic scene. It's a sight of pure, unbridled potential, a promise of abundance and prosperity.

Ahead, nestled in a dell, lies the familiar stone fortress of my ambitions. Its towers stretch towards the heavens, built meticulously over years, stone by stone. It's my sanctuary, my legacy, and it's where I intended to celebrate my triumph. As I near, the fortress doors swing open, revealing not the grand feast and merriment I had envisioned, but an echoing emptiness. My stomach lurches as I step inside. The vast dining hall is bare, not a table nor chair to be found. The walls, once adorned with the tapestries of my accomplishments, are bare, the faint outlines of their absence like ghostly wounds.

The shock is hot, immediate, a wave of molten lava in my belly that threatens to consume me. I clench my fists, nails digging into palms, as I grapple with the reality before me. The fortress, my dream, my future - it's all gone. Vanished like a mirage, leaving behind a bitter taste of failure and disillusionment.

But as the initial shock wears off, like a tide receding to reveal smooth pebbles on the beach, something else stirs within me. A spark, small and flickering, but unyielding. It's the part of me that refused to yield when faced with impossible odds, that chose to forge ahead when the path was unclear. It's the part that knows that even if the dream has been derailed, the journey isn't over.

I step outside, the wheat field bathed in the silvery light of the full moon. The night is cool, the air crisp, and the world, while changed, is still full of potential. The fortress may be empty, but the field is full of wheat, and somewhere, under the right conditions, wheat will grow again. And so, I turn my back on the empty fortress, my gaze fixed on the horizon, where another sunrise awaits.
