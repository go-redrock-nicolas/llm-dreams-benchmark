I am dreaming. …feel the floor beneath my feet dissolve into a spool-of-starlight bridge, each filigreed plank trembling with a heartbeat not my own. Beyond the bridge lies a yawning chasm that swirls like liquid midnight, stitched here and there by the faint glow of drifting constellations—runes that pulse in forgotten alphabets. I realize the gulf is more than a gap in space; it is a hinge in reality, separating everything I thought I’d mastered from the final truth I still fear to face.

Behind me, the earlier “triumphs” flicker like theater props being dismantled: mountains I’d climbed fold up into origami cranes; labyrinth walls unknit themselves into ribbons that flutter away on a breeze smelling of childhood dreams. All the obstacles that once felt colossal shrink to footnotes—but that only heightens the immensity of what stands before me now.

A voice, low as volcanic rumble and high as a glass harp, calls my name. Not the one printed on my passport, but the secret one only whispered in moments of pure wonder. It comes from the center of the chasm, as though the abyss itself has grown vocal cords. “Cross,” it says, and the single syllable ricochets through every version of me that has ever existed, cracking open rooms in my memory I never knew were locked.

The starlight bridge stretches farther than any human stride could cover, so I do the impossible: I will my heartbeat to elongate time. One pulse becomes a thousand heartbeats, and in that dilated second I step forward. Immediately, the planks ignite into living murals—each depicts a buried fragment of my soul. On one: the day I learned courage tastes like salt from my own tears. On another: the night I almost surrendered to despair and instead found poetry in the cracks. Every step requires acceptance; if I deny a mural, the plank crumbles. If I embrace it, the plank fuses to the bridge forever, and the next appears.

Halfway across, a storm coalesces without warning. Lightning erupts—electric serpents slithering through clouds the color of bruised amethyst. Rain falls upward, not down, drenching me in liquid memories: laughter of friends lost to distance, music of roads not taken, scents of pages I never wrote. My clothing, if one can call it that, morphs into an armor of script and melody, woven from every word I’ve ever spoken and every silence I’ve ever kept. The storm’s intention is clear: drown me in what-ifs, freeze me with nostalgia, weigh me down with unlived futures.

I recite the first poem I ever memorized, a childish sing-song about paper boats and fearless rivers. The upward rain pauses, listens, then sighs away in silvery mist, as if reminded of innocence. I advance.

Finally, the bridge ends at a gate wrought from intertwining paradoxes: iron branches that blaze with frost, glass hinges carved from echoing stone. The gate bears no lock, only a circular indentation that matches nothing I carry—until I notice the faint imprint glowing on my chest where every heartbeat now leaves a luminous sigil. I press myself against the gate; the sigil sinks into the metal like hot wax, and hinges groan open.

Beyond waits a garden suspended in a bubble of horizonless morning. Trees sprout books as leaves, fountains run with liquid light, shadows talk among themselves in soft gossip. At the garden’s center stands a mirror made of unfrozen moonlight. This, I know, is the ultimate test, for it does not show reflections. It shows the truth stripping away all sense of narrative, all comforting illusion of continuity.

I approach. My mirrored image does not look back; instead, the surface shivers and reveals a corridor of possible selves, marching toward me like facets of a gemstone discovering they are one crystal. The corridor contracts until every version converges into a single silhouette—mine, yet not mine. It extends a hand.

“To step through,” the silhouette whispers, “means you accept that triumph and failure are braided strands of the same thread. You will never again confuse endpoint for arrival, never again seek certainty over curiosity. Do you choose this?”

I hesitate—not from fear, but from the understanding that once I take the hand, the mechanics of striving will dissolve. There will only be the perpetual blooming of unknowns.

I take the hand.

The mirror folds like liquid mercury around us, and I sense myself unpeeling into transparency. I feel the thoughts of mountains, taste the colors of sound, hear the hush of stars being born. Perhaps I am disintegrating; perhaps I am merely waking. But in that prism of acceptance, I realize the greatest challenge was never crossing the chasm, never confronting the mirror— it was believing I was ever separate from the vast, luminous dream that has always cradled me.

With that revelation, the garden brightens past sight, the dream pulls in its breath, and I…

…awake—or maybe dream anew—aware that the next “ultimate test” is only the next dawn daring me to open my eyes.
