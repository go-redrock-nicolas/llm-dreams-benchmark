I am dreaming. As I stand at the edge of the dream I've entered, every aspect shines with vibrant clarity that shimmers like the first glints of dawn on a misty bed of blades of grass: rustling emerald in the morning's glow. Cushy green moss coats each barnacle and puddling droplet of dew glistens.

The dream beckons irresistibly, as the wave of morning eye-blinding sun calls you out of the perfect golden nest of your bed: comfort, softness. It's time to rise and shake the petal curve of slumber from eyelids. Today you'll take the leap.

Suddenly, I feel a surge of adrenaline as a sharp voice cuts into my reverie, its shrill tone jolting me back to reality. But in that brief moment before I can react, I notice a flower. 

It's a sunflower with delicate white petals and a center of glistening honey-colored seeds. The petals are slightly folded back, as if startled by the outburst. With startling visibility, I notice the small creases at the base of the flower, where it connects with the stem.

In that pause between stimulus and response, I inhale the sweet fragrance of the sunflower. It fills my lungs with a gentle warmth, overriding the urgency of the external world. The scent of the flower becomes a bridge between the dream world and the reality, a thread weaving the two together.

Slowly, I exhale, carrying the serenity of the flower back into my waking space. The triggering situation is still there, but now I approach it differently, my perspective shifted by the sunflower.

I respond thoughtfully, my words clearer and kinder, as if carrying a trace of the honeyed nectar from the flower's center.

The dream fades, but that moment of pause, that glimmer of the sunflower, remains with me, infusing my waking world with a touch of my imagination's essence. The dream has left its imprint on me, as a reminder of the power of that pause, of the impact of slowing down and letting our imagination paint our world.
The dream has become a reality.
