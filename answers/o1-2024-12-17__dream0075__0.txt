I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

It is said this award is granted only once every thousand days, reserved for those whose talents stretch beyond the ordinary. To earn it, one must surrender to a test so demanding that it borders on the impossible.

Layer upon layer of training—days, months, years—has shaped your every breath, your every waking and sleeping moment. Now, as you stand at the threshold of the final evaluation, the dreamscape around you expands like a living tapestry, mirroring your pulse.

The chamber for the trial is carved from shimmering obsidian, built into a colossal mountainside. Its walls reflect traces of a stormy sky above, so it appears you are standing in a swirl of charged slate-gray clouds. The wind outside howls an otherworldly chant, rattling the tall obsidian doors. You push them open, and your reflection dances in the dark surfaces as you step inside.

Within, a single corridor glows with an elusive, silvery light. It seems to be tugging you forward, beckoning you deeper, whispering that here is where all secrets—and your fate—are revealed. Faint echoes of your past achievements thrum through the corridor, voices of mentors and rivals swirling by your ears as intangible phantoms. You can almost feel their hands on your shoulders, steadying you with one final push.

You pass seven archways, each inscribed with symbols you once studied feverishly. The arches are stacked high with labyrinthine carvings illustrating feats of skill, passion, and bravery. Under the last archway, the corridor opens up into an amphitheater of swirling starlight. Marble steps curve downward, forming concentric circles that lead to a central platform—luminescent with crystalline shards. The entire space feels at once boundless and intimate, as though it exists inside a single, powerful heartbeat.

At the center stands a massive crystal orb perched on a stand of interlocking gold filigree. It seems to hum softly, pulsing with the very life of the dream itself. The orb resonates with your own heartbeat as you draw nearer. You remember from your years of preparation that this orb is the Gate of Proving: it will judge the depth of your skill, your fortitude, and above all else, the purity of your dedication.

Tentatively, you reach out and place your hands upon the orb. It is cool, like touching a distant star. The moment your palms make contact, blinding light bursts forth, and the amphitheater dissolves into pure radiance. Your consciousness fractures into countless reflections. You sense your spirit traveling through each memory of your training, revisiting heartbreak and triumph with astounding clarity. Every scalding sunrise run, every late-night session submerged in ancient texts, every stinging moment of self-doubt—and every burst of unwavering resolve.

Then, as the swirling illusions begin to thin, you find yourself in a gilded courtyard bathed in moonlight. The walls are draped in shimmering white silk, and the floor is tiled with shards of pearl, each fragment capturing strands of lunar radiance. A single, faceless figure stands at the far end of this courtyard, garbed in robes made of stardust woven with delicate threads of silver. You realize this figure holds the final key, for it is said that the last test is not a performance of skill before an audience, but rather a confrontation with the solitude of your own spirit. 

Without words, the figure gestures for you to present yourself, to demonstrate how you have merged skill with heart, mind, and resolve. Music of unknown origin fills the space—mystical notes that flutter like hummingbirds just out of reach. It prompts you to draw upon every discipline you've ever learned, each technique practiced until it became part of your breath. You find yourself dancing the outlines of sacred geometry, your movements forging bright sigils in the air. Your voice finds an anthem deep within, carrying half-forgotten lyrics that seam together the fragments of your dream. Every note, every step is an offering of your entire self.

The faceless figure sweeps an arm across the still night sky, and the stars overhead begin to gather, forming a constellation in your honor. A hush falls—your measure is taken. The figure places a hand on your shoulder, as weightless as a butterfly alighting. The moon’s glow flares with sudden brilliance, and the entire courtyard bathes in silver flame. Through that effulgence, you recognize the shape of your own silhouette, crowned by the light of recognition. A rush of emotion overwhelms you: the sweet realization that you have, at last, proven yourself worthy.

Slowly, the courtyard dissolves. The silver flames fade into warm candlelight as echoes of your heartbeat guide you back. You stand once more in the amphitheater, the crystal orb pulsing beneath your hands. You sense, in the depths of your dreaming consciousness, that the final challenge is nearly complete. The shadows retract from the edges of the amphitheater, revealing an array of figures seated at the highest row—judges or perhaps spirits watching your performance. Their eyes gleam with ancient wisdom and measured respect.

A hush falls. Your breath, steady now, resounds in the space. You feel the heavy weight of the moment—and the triumphant echo of all the effort that led you here. In a crackle of luminous splendor, the orb’s brilliance condenses, becoming a single gold seal that floats into your outstretched hands. The crowd of figures vanishes like dust on the wind, leaving only a solemn, comforting silence.

You feel the seal’s warmth radiate through your chest, drifting into your body. At once, everything—your hope, your exultation, your exhausted relief—coalesces, becoming a shining testament to your success. You clench the seal close to your heart. The dream quivers at the edges, shimmering with a final swirl of nearness and reality, before tugging you back into the crossfade of waking.

You rise with the dawn, triumphant and renewed. The vibrant sensation of that award still hums through your veins, an echo of silver-laced starlight whispering: you have earned what once seemed impossible.
