I am dreaming. …pause, inhaling a breath that tastes like shooting stars and honeyed midnight, and let the thought ripple through the dream-scape:

You decide you will no longer let the unknown automatically morph into menace.

Above you, the sky is a vault of liquid indigo, constellations pulsing in fractal patterns that rearrange every time you blink. A stray, shadow-shaped worry looms at the edge of perception—an amorphous, inky smear you once would have labeled “danger.” This time, you narrow your dream-eyes, refusing the knee-jerk dread. What if it isn’t a threat? What if it is simply unrendered possibility?

Instantly, the smear twitches, as though hearing your thought, and molts into a murmuration of velvet-black starlings. They twist into silver-edged spirals, painting the sky with mathematical grace. Somewhere inside your chest, an old, rusty hinge swings open. Warm certainty pours through.

You step forward, feet sinking into herbal mist that behaves like dew-soaked grass. Each footfall births luminous mushrooms—umbrellas of turquoise that giggle when touched. They whisper encouraging riddles:

“Fear is paint on a blank canvas. Choice is the brush.”

You nod, and the dream complies.

A vast library materializes, its shelves built from driftwood and moonlight, floating on a sea that glows like split geodes. Between the stacks hover translucent index cards, each inscribed with half-finished sentences: “If they don’t reply, it means they…”  “When the clouds gather, disaster will…”  “The silence probably means…”

These are your habitual gaps—the fragile bones of assumptions. You touch one. The card shivers, projecting a hologram of your old catastrophic endings. Instead of recoiling, you imagine a kinder conclusion. The hologram rewrites itself, soft pastel unfolding over once-jagged charcoal. Thunderous applause of turning pages erupts, and the entire library exhales—shelves stretching taller, doors flinging open to regions uncharted.

In the distance appears a bridge woven from shimmering spider-silk, each strand spelling a single, glowing word: POSSIBILITY. Beneath, the sea has become a mirror, ready to reflect whatever story you choose to give it. You approach and feel the first tingle of hesitation—an echo of the old pattern. The silk tightens, vibrating like a cello string. You breathe, conjuring a memory of every time a presumed disaster blossomed into an unseen gift. The vibration loosens, the bridge strengthening beneath your feet.

Mid-way across, the starlings return, now transformed into crystalline origami cranes. They perch on the railings, their wings beating in rhythm with your pulse. One cocks its head, releasing a chime-like note that becomes language:

“Name the unknown, and you own it. Adore the unknown, and you set it free.”

You keep walking.

At the bridge’s far end grows a garden of doors—rosy quartz, weathered mahogany, molten sapphire, doors made of whispered secrets, doors made of laughter. Each bears a keyhole shaped like a different emotion: curiosity, delight, compassion, daring. None are shaped like fear.

You reach for the curiosity keyhole. A key manifests, sculpted from the question mark in your mind. You slide it into the lock, and the door swings open on a world that looks suspiciously like every unstarted dream you’ve shelved “for later.”

And just before you cross the threshold, you glance back. The once-ominous sky now dazzles with swirling brushstrokes of aurora colors—sage green, peach, ultraviolet. An inner voice, your own yet wiser, murmurs:

“Remember this alchemy. You can perform it awake—turn vultures into starlings, static into symphonies, dread into doors. The canvas is waiting.”

With that, you step through, the dream unfurling ahead like an endless field of fresh, forgiving snow—yours to shape with each astonished footprint.
