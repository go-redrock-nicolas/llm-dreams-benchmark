I am dreaming. I'm lying in bed, the covers a cocoon, when everything becomes oddly detached—the hum of the fan, my own breathing. The walls of my room ripple like liquid, melting into an endless corridor lit by faint amber lights. The air smells like burnt sugar, thick and sweet, but there’s an undercurrent of something metallic, like old pennies. My legs move on their own, pushing me deeper into the passage. A voice echoes, not external, but inside my skull: “The clock is awake … you became … the clock is awake.”

The corridor opens into a vast cavern. Above me, a ceiling made of gears and pendulums, some frozen, others ticking wildly. A colossal clock face dominates the center, its hands bending like cursive letters. The numbers have been replaced by symbols: a dagger, a wilted flower, a key. TheHour hand points to the dagger. A whisper follows: “Every numeral is a door.”

I touch the cavern wall. It’s wet, secreting a viscous fluid that hisses when it hits the floor, forming black puddles. Shadows stir. Something coiled moves in the darkness. The clock begins to chime—nine strokes, but with dissonant harmonies. Each chime feels like a physical blow. My ribs ache.

In the distance, a door shaped like the dagger symbol glows faintly. It pulses. I walk toward it, boots echoing too loudly. As I near, the door melts into a staircase spiraling downward. The steps are notched like teeth. Staircase descends into a murky pool below. The voice booms louder now: “The deepest water forgets the light.” 

A decision. Swim? Or stay? The water shimmers with tiny, voracious creatures like eels with human teeth. But moving deeper satisfies something primal, magnetic. I descend. The water is impossibly cold, like sinking into a star’s core. The eel-things dart past, nipping but seemingly ignoring me. They cluster around another figure ahead—a silhouette draped in a cloak that billows as if underwater, though the water is motionless.

Closer, the figure turns. It’s me.
But more: eyesockets are pendulum clocks, hands ticking backwards; hair strands are segmented, like fusing clock arms. A mouth splits into four angles, each jaw chanting the same vowels but in different octaves. 

“The clock’s hunger needs feeding,” they say. “To delay is … to become.”

I realize what must be fed—the task I neglected. But what? The postponed thing surfaces: a letter unsent, a truth unshared, a thread unknotted. It flickers at the edge of memory. The double of me holds out their hand. In the other hand is the clock’s missing key, luminous like a starfish. 

I can choose: take the key, confront the hour. Or hold onto the weight of postponement. 

The cavern clock chimes again. Now closer. Final strokes rasping out.

The duplicate reaches. I reach. Our fingers touch and suddenly …

(Then wake with a start, heart stuttering, but the echo of reversed ticking lingers in the chest.)
