I am dreaming. My senses heighten as I walk down a busy city street on a peculiarly still autumn afternoon. The air feels thick, almost gelatinous, and carries an electric charge that makes the hair on my arms stand up. Looking around, I notice everyone else seems oblivious to the unnatural quality of the atmosphere, continuing their daily routines as if nothing is amiss.

Then I see it - the pigeons. Hundreds of them, eerily perched in perfect geometric formations along the building ledges, completely motionless. Their eyes glow with an unsettling amber light. Above them, the clouds are swirling in a counter-clockwise spiral, but only I seem to notice this meteorological impossibility.

My heart begins to pound as I spot more warning signs: All the digital clocks on the street have frozen at 3:33, yet people check their phones without concern. The leaves falling from trees are drifting upward instead of down. A low-frequency hum vibrates through the soles of my shoes, growing steadily more intense.

I try to call out to others, but my voice comes out as shimmering ribbons of color instead of sound. The adrenaline surges through my body as I realize something monumental is about to occur. The air begins to ripple like heat waves off hot pavement, but it's cold - so cold my breath should be visible, yet it isn't.

In mounting panic, I notice the shadows of buildings and people beginning to detach and slide away from their sources, like dark water flowing uphill. The geometric pigeons turn their heads in perfect synchronization to stare at me, their amber eyes now pulsing with urgent warning...

The hum grows to a deafening crescendo as the sky above splits open like a cosmic zipper, revealing a kaleidoscopic void beyond our reality. And still, the people around me continue their routines, blind to the unraveling of the world...
