I am dreaming. step forward into the shimmering haze between us, feeling the weight of old words thick as fog around my ankles. The air ripples, colors shifting—rose and indigo—casting the familiar room in otherworldly light. My voice trembles with both fear and hope as I speak, this time not from the fortress of stubborn pride, but from a hidden, tender well within.

“I want to understand,” I whisper, and suddenly the scene bends and warps. The walls peel away like ancient bark, revealing a sun-drenched meadow where the air is sweet with wildflowers. Every petal hums with possibility. We are both barefoot now, roots curling from our toes into the forgiving earth.

Instead of bracing for another storm, I reach out. My hand is not a weapon, but an olive branch, trembling but true. As if in answer, they lower the shield I never truly saw. Patterns of pain scatter like startled birds. We walk together in this unfamiliar, blooming place, pausing to listen—not only to each other but to the subtle symphony of light, wind, forgiveness, and the raw desire to begin again.

The cycle breaks with a gentle shattering—glass, not in anger, but like the thawing of winter’s last hold. Every dream, after all, holds the possibility of awakening into something changed, something freer, something brighter. And in this dream, the conflict dissolves, not into silence, but into a promise: To return to that meadow, awake or asleep, whenever we need to remember how to choose understanding over hurt, and hope over harm.
