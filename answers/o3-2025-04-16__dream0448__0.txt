I am dreaming. …lean forward and let the reins of reason slip from my hands.  

I drift inside a cobalt-blue dusk where the horizon folds in on itself like silk in water.  Lanternfish the size of swallows dart through the evening air, weaving silver ribbons that hum with quiet mathematics I cannot quite decipher.  Each hum morphs into a half-remembered melody—one I used to whistle as a child whenever I “just knew” something was right.

A great stairway of translucent lotus petals unfurls beneath my feet, suspending me above fields of slumbering clocks.  Their hands twitch, but none of them tick.  Time here is an obedient dog, waiting for me to call it, yet I let it nap.  Instead I trust the subtle tug in my ribs—my inner compass—pulling me sideways, not forward.

With every step, logic-colored bricks crumble off the path and drop into an ink-black abyss, yet I feel no fear, only exhilaration.  At the stairway’s summit stands an obsidian archway carved with symbols my rational mind refuses to parse.  I do not bother deciphering; I place my palm on the cool stone and ask my heartbeat to answer instead.  A violet key materializes between my fingers—soft as moonlight, warm as memory.  The arch sighs open.

On the other side, a library of impossible shelves floats in zero gravity: books made of rainfall, scrolls penned in birdsong, atlases stitched from yesterday’s shadows.  I reach for the volume that glows like dawn behind closed eyelids.  Its title is a question I have never dared ask aloud—but my gut recognizes it as an old friend.  Pages turn themselves, revealing maps that redraw while I watch, always staying one breath ahead of comprehension.  Each time I surrender my urge to “understand,” a silver line etches itself into the map, marking a trail.  My logical mind growls, frustrated; my intuition dances, triumphant.

I follow the shimmering path out a window that wasn’t there a moment ago.  It opens onto an ocean of cloud-mirrors, each reflecting a future that could be.  I choose the mirror whose reflection feels like a faint pulse under my skin, step through, and find myself surfing a current of stardust toward a horizon dripping with auroras.

I realize then: my intuitive hunches are not flashes in the dark but constellations already strung across the sky, guiding me home.  All I have to do is look up, trust the pattern, and let the stars finish my sentences.
