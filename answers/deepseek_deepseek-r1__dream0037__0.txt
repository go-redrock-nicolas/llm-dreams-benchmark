I am dreaming. <placeholderno794>

The air in the chamber is thick with whispers, a low hum that thrums in my bones. The room is ancient, its walls carved from a single colossal geode; amethyst crystals spiral upward, glinting with inner light that casts violet shadows on the faces of the two delegations. The leaders sit across from each other at a table shaped like a crescent moon, its surface liquid obsidian that reflects their rigid postures like fractured mirrors. 

**The Skyborne** float slightly above their seats, their luminous wings—iridescent and diaphanous—quivering with suppressed rage. Their voices resonate like distant thunder. *"The stars themselves weep when your machines claw at the mountains,"* their emissary intones, gesturing with a hand that shimmers with constellations. *"Return the stolen sky-iron. Tear down your foundries. Only then will the auroras bless your skies again."* 

**The Earthbound** slam their gauntleted fists on the table, making the obsidian ripple. Their armor, forged from the very ore in dispute, pulses with a deep crimson glow, like magma beneath rock. *"Without the sky-iron, our cities will freeze,"* their warlord growls, eyes smoldering like coals. *"Your auroras are pretty lies. We demand the right to mine the celestial veins—or we’ll take them."*

The tension crystallizes into something palpable; the geode walls begin to sing, a high, keening note. My hands tremble as I lift the **Promise Chalice**, an artifact between them, its rim threaded with starlight and its bowl filled with a liquid that mirrors both factions’ eyes. I speak, and my voice is not my own—it is the sigh of winds through canyon bones, the crackle of fire in a forge. *"You seek balance? Drink. Taste the cost of your demands."*

Reluctantly, they sip. The Skyborne’s wings molt feathers that dissolve into smoke; the Earthbound’s armor cracks, revealing scars of old famines. For a heartbeat, their faces soften—until a child’s laugh echoes through the chamber. A girl stands in the doorway, half her hair woven with starlight, the other half threaded with iron filings. She holds a toy: a windmill forged from sky-iron, spinning soundlessly without wind.

The delegations still. The walls stop singing. And in that silence, I realize—*she is the dreamer*. The true mediator. But before she can speak, the ground quakes, and the vision fractures…
