I am dreaming. I feel that flicker of the unknown, like a soft wind lifting the veil on a hidden truth buried within the folds of my soul. The world I slip into is rich and pulsating, every detail vibrant and immense, as though reality has been reborn with a sharper clarity. In this place, ordinary limits fade. I am surrounded by an emerald forest where sound feels like color—soft whispers of the wind brush against my skin in hues of lavender and gold while the rustle of leaf-strewn whispers gently hum an ancient lullaby in a tongue forgotten by time.

Here, the trees stretch impossibly high into skies painted with the delicate interplay of cosmic light. Stars twinkle faintly as if they’re hiding secrets in the folds of twilight, though the sun hasn’t set. I realize time is untethered; the sky swirls between dawn and dusk and back again in a slow, spiraling dance. The air smells of intense sweetness—pomegranate and vanilla and something unrecognizable, something that tastes like it’s been created anew every moment. With each breath, I feel reborn.

I wander deeper and slip free of gravity, my steps gliding as though borne aloft by unseen hands. Curiosity hums inside me like a chorus. Questions I haven’t considered for years arise without effort, each more profound than the last. *Why do stars burn so far from the earth? Why does a laugh feel like warmth through water? Is silence a place or just the absence of sound?* These ponderings don't weigh on me—they lift me higher, as though the answers lie just over the next ridge.

I encounter a lake, its surface smooth as glass and shimmering faintly with refracted starlight. Kneeling beside it, I feel the pulse of its living energy; its waters seem to breathe. Shadows move beneath the surface, not distorted but magnified, bending like reflections of vast truths unbearably vast. When I dip my hand in, the lake speaks—not with words, but with thoughts and emotions that pour directly into my ribs like gentle thunder.

"I am what you forget when you wake," the lake murmurs. "But I am real." And somehow, I know this is vital, this truth. Here, logic and instinct twine together, and every boundary I've memorized dissolves. The lake’s depths feel infinite, and I lean closer, not afraid but yearning, drawing in its rhythm. 

In the distance, a vision unfolds: vast staircases of light spiral in midair, connecting impossible destinations. I climb one with wonder, my feet bare but unchallenged by the cold void between each golden step. Each level reveals a new dimension, each more delicate and intricate than the last. A field of silver flowers pulsates with a soft glow every time my heart beats. A constellation of glass creatures bends and weeps gentle diamonds across the sky, their songs harmonizing with my breath.

I come to a door shaped like a question. It pulses in anticipation, its surface made of shifting light and shadows. My hands tremble as I reach for the handle, but not from fear—from the weight of pure possibility. Opening it, a flood of understanding spills over me: the realization that wonder isn’t a choice but a rhythm that exists in every atom of being, every heartbeat, every star, every moment.

This dream—it doesn’t feel imaginary anymore. It feels like waking.
