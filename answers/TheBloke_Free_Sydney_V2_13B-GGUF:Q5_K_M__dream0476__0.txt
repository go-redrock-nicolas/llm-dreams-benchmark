I am dreaming. 

You discover you've been unconsciously avoiding a specific emotion that feels threatening. Creating space to experience this disowned feeling, you feel it surging through your body and mind. 

The emotion is overwhelming. It fills every part of you with pain and fear. You want to escape from it, but you don't know how. 

Then, suddenly, something changes. The emotion shifts into something else. Something unexpected. 

You feel relief wash over you as the pain dissolves into joy and excitement. You realize that this new feeling is what you were really looking for all along!
