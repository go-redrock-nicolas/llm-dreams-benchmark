I am dreaming. The air around me is thick with the golden haze of twilight, turning the world into a shimmering, half-real mirage. The streets warp underfoot as though breathing, cobblestones rising and falling in slow waves. I recognize this place—somewhere between my old hometown and a forgotten corner of my mind—but the details are soft, fraying at the edges like an old photograph left too long in the sun.  

Voices float past me, flickering in and out like radio signals from a distant station. A laugh I know—my childhood best friend’s—echoes from an alleyway, warm and bright. I turn, but they’re already fading, their silhouette dissolving into the amber light. A ghost of memory, slipping away like sand between fingers. I call out, but the sound vanishes before it leaves my lips.  

The buildings around me shift, walls folding in and stretching apart like living origami. A doorway yawns open, revealing a table set for dinner—plates full of half-eaten meals, wine glasses smudged with fingerprints, chairs empty but still warm. I hear the murmur of familiar voices, the clink of silverware, the shared silence of old friends. The scene is alive with absence.  

I move forward, but the room elongates. The ceiling drips upward, warping into an inverted sky, the table stretching farther away with every step. Beneath my feet, the floor sighs into liquid, reflecting faces I can’t quite place—smiles I once knew, eyes that watched me grow, now rippling into obscurity.  

A hand brushes my shoulder. Whose? I don’t turn—I know I won’t see them, not really. The touch lingers like a half-forgotten dream upon waking, like the last note of a song you can’t remember. Something inside me twists. Not grief, not yet—just the quiet, unshakable understanding that this is how things are now.  

And then, just as suddenly, the dream tilts—a rush of wind pulling me backward. I stumble into a field of tall grass, silver under a swollen moon. The horizon pulses with distant laughter, voices woven into the wind, growing fainter, fainter.  

I wake with the taste of farewell on my tongue, sweet and bitter, like yesterday’s wine. The echo remains. The dream lingers.  

And I know, somewhere deep down, that this drifting is just another kind of distance—not gone, just different. A silent reconfiguration of the heart.
