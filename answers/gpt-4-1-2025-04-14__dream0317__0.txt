I am dreaming. …feel the air thicken with possibility. A shimmering portal has appeared in the center of an ancient, moonlit forest—its edges flicker like liquid silver, bending the trees into prismatic arcs. Mist swirls at my feet, icy-cool and laced with the scent of crushed violets and moss. Goosebumps rise on my skin, not just from the chill, but from a thrill that crackles in my bones.

With each step, the forest sounds shift—wind in the leaves now whispers in forgotten languages, and shadows on the path pulse with hidden life. Somewhere between anticipation and awe, I reach out. My hand touches the portal’s edge and my nerves tingle with electric delight, as if I've touched the star-studded skin of the universe itself.

Trembling with both fear and giddy curiosity, I draw a breath that carries the taste of ozone and distant rain. I step forward. The world melts away and I tumble through the silver, plunging into a new landscape.

Gravity feels different here: lighter, as if held by dreams rather than strict laws. I land softly atop a rolling hill where the grass is violet and every blade is tipped with dew that sparkles in neon rainbows. The sky is a riot of shifting colors—lavender, coral, turquoise—alive with drifting motes of light that swoop and swirl like curious fireflies.

In the valley below, gigantic flowers unfurl with a gentle sigh, releasing clouds of golden pollen that dance and coalesce into fleeting shapes: the faces of unknown friends, the outline of forgotten songs. Overhead, strange birds with crystalline feathers wheel and sing music that tastes of memory and cinnamon.

I begin to walk, letting the sheer impossibility of the place pour over me. Each pebble hums underfoot, resonating with stories I can almost understand. A river winds nearby, its waters clear as hope and filled with mirrored reflections of countless futures—some I long for, some I have never dared to imagine.

Drawn forward by a hunger for wonder, I realize the rules here are my own. The deepest parts of my heart, usually armored, are open and unguarded, ready to embrace every oddity, every marvel. In this fresh, impossible world, the only language is awe, and I follow its call—one step deeper into the impossible, where every moment promises a new revelation and the boundaries of reality quietly dissolve behind me.
