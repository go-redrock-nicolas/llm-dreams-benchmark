I am dreaming.

The world is thick with sapphire night, shuddering with electric expectation. I find myself in the heart of a glass-walled control room, perched atop a craggy cliff that plunges into a swirling, phosphorescent sea. Twelve teammates stand around me, faces flickering with reflected light from an array of holograph displays floating in the air—each projection pulsing with vital statistics and swirling maps. The critical situation: A chain reaction deep below the cliffs threatens to split the earth, setting loose rivers of silvery fire that could consume the city glowing faintly on the distant horizon.

The pressure in the air tastes metallic; each second thrums like a drumbeat in my veins. Alarms peal softly, barely perceptible beneath a dense hush. My senses sharpen—I hear the technician’s shallow breaths, spot a glimmer of sweat tracing down the cartographer’s temple, and feel every vibration in the floor beneath my boots.

Suddenly, a new problem unfurls. One sensor array plummets to red. Data lines twist into a tangled mess. My mind, lucid despite the chaos, insists I be everywhere at once. Disregarding the transparent walls, I walk straight through—my dream body unbound—emerging into a windstorm swirling with luminous motes. I spiral upward, simultaneously watching from above and moving among my team: guiding a trembling engineer’s gloved hand, reading encrypted code reflected in a mathematician’s eyes, comforting a terrified medic with words that emerge as fragrant petals instead of sound.

Every detail shivers with consequence. A misaligned satellite dish shudders in a sudden gust, its shadow stretching across the trembling sea. I soar down, hands becoming threads of golden light; I weave them through the machinery, restoring equilibrium. The status boards in the control room flicker from angry scarlet to hopeful emerald.

Problems multiply, but my presence multiplies too. I am at every station, in every mind—my awareness is a conductor’s baton, stitching harmony out of chaos. Time slips and warps; in a single moment, I count the heartbeats of my entire team, knowing which ones belong to fear, resolve, hope. The critical situation bends, sways, and at the crescendo, breaks: The chain reaction is tamed, the silver flames subside, and the sea sings softly to itself once more.

Everything settles. The team collapses in exhausted relief, staring uncomprehendingly as the first rays of a lavender dawn pierce the night. I step back into myself, feeling the truth of command: that the greatest power is not control, but connection—a shimmering network of trust, wound through the deepest parts of a dreamer’s imagination.
