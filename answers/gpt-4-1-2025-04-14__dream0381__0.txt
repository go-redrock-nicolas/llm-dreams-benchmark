I am dreaming. —I am dreaming.

A translucent silver mist swirls around my ankles as I float, weightless, through a twilight forest. The trees are impossibly tall—obelisks of ancient sorrow—each with ink-black bark and leaves that glitter like shards of broken glass. The sky is neither night nor day, painted in forbidden shades of blue and violet, pulsing with the slow heartbeat of something vast and unseen.

Ahead, a curving path beckons: smooth stones set into the moss, each one glowing with a gentle inner light. With every step, I feel drawn toward shimmering echoes—half-familiar figures and voices, laughter and longing braided together, calling to me from the shadows between the trees. I follow, mesmerized, pulled by the promise of connection and understanding. My heart races with hope, but each time I reach for the blurred figures, they recede, dissolving into mist that seeps cold and sharp beneath my skin.

Suddenly, a mirror appears before me—a frame made of twisting roots and shattered hopes. My reflection gazes back, eyes wide with longing and sorrow. Around me swirl fragments of my past: moments of trust misplaced, of hearts broken, of wounds that never quite closed. I see myself repeating the same dance, attracted again and again to edges sharp enough to cut, to warmth that turns to fire.

Recognition blooms, achingly bright—a lantern in the mist. With trembling hands, I reach into the mirror, grasping the shimmering thread that connects each painful echo. I begin to untangle it, gently, patiently, each knot a memory unspooled, held up to the liminal light. As I work, the forest hushes. The glass leaves cease their restless tinkling, and the echoing voices grow quiet, watching.

I feel a current of power in my chest—delicate but fierce—the audacious hope that this cycle can end. As the final knot comes undone, the mist recedes, revealing a new path winding out of the trees, illuminated by soft fireflies. I breathe deeply, untethered from old patterns, and step, glowing, into the dawn breaking just beyond the forest’s edge.

And in that luminous hush, I understand: healing is possible. Even in dreams.
