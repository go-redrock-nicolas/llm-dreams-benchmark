I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

At first you hover in a vast, moonlit antechamber, its walls carved from opalescent stone that pulses like a giant heartbeat. Soft violet light spills from arched windows that open onto endless starfields. You wear nothing but a simple robe, its silken threads shifting in hue whenever you move. A hush ripples through the chamber—then, from behind a luminous veil, a panel of robed figures steps forward. One raises a crystalline scepter, and with a voice like wind through glass announces: “You have been chosen.”

Chosen for what, you wonder? You barely remember applying. But the next instant you feel the weight of that announcement settling on your shoulders: you’ve qualified for the Celestial Conservatory of Ætheric Arts, the realm’s most secretive institute—where virtuosos bend reality through sound and light. You clutch the hem of your robe, heart pounding. You’ve only just begun to learn the craft’s cryptic foundations: how to coax color from silence, shape melodies into living sculptures. Still, nothing in your waking life prepared you for this moment.

A door slides open and you’re guided into a circular auditorium carved from black marble veined with molten silver. Hundreds of empty seats rise in tiers around a central dais. At its center rests the instrument you must master: a harp woven from spider-silk veins and living amethyst, each string humming with trapped starlight. You step forward, every step magnifying the echo, until you stand before the harp’s gossamer frame.

Your fingertips hover above the first string; it trembles, emitting a single, crystalline note that resonates within your chest. Panic flares—your mind blank, your muscle memory nonexistent. The council’s silent gaze weighs on you like a physical force. You draw in a shaky breath, feeling the scent of incense and ozone swirling around you. Then, almost without choice, you pluck again. This time, a ribbon of color unfurls from the note—a ribbon of amber fire that swirls into the shape of a bird, beating wings before dissolving into motes of light.

A gasp ripples through the crowd. Your heart lurches between triumph and terror. You realize that each trembling string wants only to be heard, to be freed from its crystalline prison. With growing confidence, you weave the next notes into a song of dawn: pale pistachio, molten copper, deep violet harmonize overhead like a living aurora. The harp answers your slightest whim, unspooling iconographies of winged beasts and leaping tides.

By the final chord, the auditorium is awash in kaleidoscopic splendor. The robed figures rise as one, cloaks rustling like falling petals. The eldest among them steps forward, pressing a glowing rune into your palm—the Conservatory’s sigil. As you slip it around your neck, the harp’s voice fades and the chamber dissolves into mist.  

You wake with your breath suspended, the echo of amethyst strings still humming in your bones. Though your fingers remember nothing tangible, in your mind a single truth remains: you have been chosen, and something deep within you already knows the song.
