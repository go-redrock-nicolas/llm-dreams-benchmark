I am dreaming. I am walking into a new town, all the streets and houses unfamiliar. The air is crisp, with a hint of jasmine. My breath forms delicate fog in the chilly morning. I see a park ahead with an old fountain, ornate with intricate carvings of mythical creatures. I hear laughter, a heartbeat, and distant music. A figure with silver hair waves and beckons me closer. I approach, and the ground beneath my feet feels like walking on water. The trees turn luminous, glowing a soft emerald. The figure speaks in a voice like wind chimes, introducing themselves as Liora, guide of the Threshold. They explain this place is between worlds, a crossroads for lost souls finding their path.Liora She tells me to Close my eyes and open my hands. When I do, a luminescent moth settles into my palm, its wings patterns like a roadmap. It whispers destinations only I can see. Now, the choice is mine—to follow its light, trusting in connection—or stay in the in-between, forever a stranger to belonging.
