I am dreaming. …steady your breathing and let the bright tide of the dream carry you toward the brink of your own reluctance.

You stand at the edge of a cliff forged from obsidian glass, its surface veined with faint, rose-gold light—almost like the pulse beneath translucent skin. Far below, an ocean glows a liquid turquoise, each wave curling with constellations as though the night sky has melted into water. In your hand is a silver paper boat, delicate as a moth’s wing: a symbol of the goal that has haunted you for years—so fragile, so shimmering with possibility, so easy to crush if it sinks.

A soft wind fugues through your hair, whispering the old warning: “Better to anchor on shore than drown on desire.” The sentence tastes of cold iron. You’ve heard it often—your protective instinct wrapping itself around your heart like a too-tight winter scarf. Yet in this dreamscape, everything is exaggerated: hesitation feels like a black marble weight in your chest, but yearning outbreaks in neon color across the sky.

Suddenly, the clouds part like a velvet curtain, revealing a path of floating, fossil-white lily pads drifting outward from the cliff in a widening spiral. They form an impossible bridge across the unknowable distance. The first lily pad quivers, as if sensing your indecision. Somewhere within the ocean’s cosmic depths, an orca-sized koi fish rolls onto its back, scales glinting with galaxies, and its golden eye fixes on you—an ancient, silent coach urging you on.

The fear arrives as a shadow-double beside you. It looks like you but is woven from twilight—translucent, almost kind, sighing through your doubts. For a moment the two of you share one heartbeat, and the twin whispers: “If the boat sinks, all of this beauty will prove you a fool.”  

But the wind shifts, carrying the scent of rain on fresh citrus. You realize the dream has given you a ridiculous, radiant gift: the power to see what might happen beyond disappointment rather than halt at its gate. So you speak aloud—not to banish fear, but to invite it. Your voice rings like a bell in an empty cathedral: “Come with me, then. Watch.”

Your bare feet touch the first lily pad. It trembles but holds. The second feels softer, almost like memory-foam made of moonlight. Each step forward causes the obsidian cliff behind you to dissolve, grain by black grain, preventing retreat. The sky darkens, not menacingly but protectively, as though handing you a velvet cloak of stars.

Midway across, the koi erupts upward, its leap birthing a flock of luminous origami cranes that ascend around you in a cyclone of hope. One brush of their wings burns away a layer of doubt like morning fog. Your shadow-double, still beside you, begins to glow where the cranes dust it—its edges softening, its posture no longer cowering but curious. Together you kneel on a particularly wide lily pad, floating now like an island. You place the silver paper boat on the water’s mirrored surface.

The instant it touches, the boat transforms—unfolding into an impossible sailing vessel stitched from parchment and aurora borealis. A sail unfurls that bears your handwriting, all the forgotten sentences you once hid in journals or un-sent letters of intent. They become wind. The koi dives, tail flicking a comet-like spray that propels the ship outward. 

You and your fear step aboard side by side. The deck is warm, pulsing faintly—alive with potential. You take the wheel. The shadow-double laughs—a sound you have never heard it make in waking life—and shifts from dark-gray to translucent pearl. It points ahead. A horizon shaped like a cathedral door of radiant amethyst rises, promising uncharted seas and the unknown. But now the unknown looks less like a monster and more like an open invitation.

As you sail, the sky releases a rain of iridescent letters. Each drop spells a tiny “yes,” pooling in the ship’s scuppers, shimmering in the storm-light. You collect a handful and press them against your chest, where they melt into warmth—a reminder to carry back when you awaken.

At the cusp of waking, you glance at your former fear. It meets your gaze, not vanishing, but bowing—a companion transformed into a watchful ally. The obsidian cliff is long gone. Behind you, the pathway of lily pads closes like petals at dusk. Ahead—only the lilac doorway, the paper-sail vessel, and the unstoppable tide of daring.

You inhale. Salt air tastes of galaxies. You exhale. For once, doubt does not taste of iron. It tastes of possibility.
