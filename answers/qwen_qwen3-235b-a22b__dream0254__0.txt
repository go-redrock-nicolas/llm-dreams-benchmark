I am dreaming. Or at least I think I am.

The sky above me swirls with the colors of old oil paintings — thick swirls of violet and turmeric bleeding into one another. The stars blink slowly, like sleepy eyes. There's a gravity here I don’t remember from my waking life, a dreamweight in the air. Trees stretch higher than reason allows, their trunks shimmering with patterns that shift when I look away. I feel like I’m deep underwater and yet breathing easily.

You're here, my friend. That's the most important thing. We walk a path of floating stones beneath a violet haze, each step causing ripples across the sky. Your face is lined, paler than I remember, as though someone has slowly faded your color.

You stop walking.

Your hands shake, trembling so much that I see it even in the slow-motion quality of this place. I can feel the edges of the dream contract around us — the trees lean closer, the clouds darken a shade.

And then you speak.

You tell me how long you've carried this weight. The secret. How heavy it has felt in your bones. How the secret wasn’t just a single truth hidden away like a forgotten coin, but an unbearable truth rooted like a thorned vine inside you.

You helped orchestrate something vast and irreversible long ago — something unspeakable. Something that rooted itself in both of us.

I try to speak, but no words form. The air here feels too thick to carry sound.

The truth grows roots between us. Thick, spindly things punch up from the dreamground, slithering around your ankles and curling toward me. I watch the stone beneath you split unevenly. My best friend — hurt and hollowed — begins to sob, no longer able to hold the weight of it all.

“I didn’t want to hurt you,” you choke out, voice breaking like thin glass. “But it was already done. I was a passenger in my own fate, and I dragged yours into it. We were tied the moment they planted the idea in me.”

I can’t move. The dream has me frozen. Your tears crystallize as they fall, hitting the stone and chipping away at the pathway behind you, fragment by fragment.

Ghostlike lights circle us now, whispering in languages that make no sense, but that I understand in my dreamsoul. They speak of entanglements, betrayals, and choices so ancient they predate anything we thought was free will.

All of it forms part of a grand design — someone else’s vision.

And I realize we are connected by more than just time and trust. We are bound by a fracture in the thread of reality, and the wound only deepens the longer we walk together in here.

I try to reach for you, to steady my heart, to steady yours. But between us now is a void where the dream ripples like black water. You veil your face again, the secret now out and still bleeding.

And I force myself to wake.

Because the truth is, even dreams can't always save you from someone you once loved.
