I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt paper and starlight, a paradoxical haze that clings to your skin like static. You stand at the base of a colossal, spiraling tower made of glass shards and frozen lightning, each level etched with glowing equations that unravel into smoke. This is the Spire of Worth, a place you’ve never seen yet always known—a monument to the unspoken rules you’ve carved into your bones. At its peak, a bell tolls without a clapper, its sound a blade that slices through the fog of your mind. *Climb*, it demands. *Climb, or be erased.*  

Your hands bleed as you grip the jagged edges of the tower, your fingers finding purchase on rungs that dissolve like ash after you pass. The higher you ascend, the more the air hums with a chorus of voices—your own, multiplied a thousandfold, each whispering a flaw: *Not fast enough. Not sharp enough. You’ll never be enough.* Below, the ground has vanished, replaced by an ocean of ink that swallows the shards you dislodge. You climb anyway, because falling means confronting the void inside you, and climbing is the only prayer you know.  

But then—a flicker. A crack in the glass reveals a sliver of something impossible: a garden blooming *inside* the tower’s walls. Vines of iridescent moss coil around forgotten tools—dented watering cans, frayed brushes, a compass with no needle. The plants pulse with bioluminescent sap, their petals shaped like open hands. You reach for one, and the tower shudders. A voice, soft as moth wings, rises from the roots: *You built this prison to hide the soil. But seeds need darkness to grow.*  

Suddenly, the Spire collapses. Not in ruin, but in surrender. The glass becomes butterflies, the equations into fireflies, the bell’s scream into a lullaby. You plummet—not down, but *outward*, through layers of sky that peel away like onion skin. Below you now is a vast plain where the ground is made of mirrors, each reflecting a version of yourself: a child stacking mismatched blocks into a wobbly castle, a teenager scribbling poems in the margins of math tests, a stranger on a train who lets the tears fall and doesn’t wipe them. The mirrors do not judge. They simply show.  

A figure materializes beside you—a woman with your face, but older, her hair a nest of live sparrows, her eyes twin eclipses. She hands you a stone that thrums like a heartbeat. *Carry this*, she says. *It’s the weight of your own breath. Light enough to hold, heavy enough to anchor you.* When you close your fingers around it, the mirrors ripple. You see yourself as you are: a mosaic of cracks and light, a work unfinished and unfinishable. Beautiful because it breathes.  

The dream softens. The mirrored plain becomes a meadow of tall grass singing in a language just beyond understanding. You lie down, and the earth does not ask you to prove its worth. Somewhere, a bell rings—not the Spire’s metallic dirge, but the warm, resonant chime of a café door swinging open. You wake with the taste of rainwater and honey on your tongue, the stone still warm in your palm.  

The standards will return, of course. But so will the garden. You’ve carved a door now, between the ribs of your own sky.
