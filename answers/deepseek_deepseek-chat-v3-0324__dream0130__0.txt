I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of scorched earth and distant rain, the kind that never quite reaches you. My feet sink into the blackened soil, each step leaving a lingering imprint where embers glow like dying stars. The world around me is a wasteland of my own ruins—collapsed towers of ambition, shattered bridges I once crossed with faith as my only lantern.  

This is the sixth time.  

I stand amid the wreckage, my hands cracked and stained with soot. I remember the first fall—a wildfire of betrayal that swallowed everything, leaving me raw but hopeful. I learned to kneel in the ashes and build again. The second time was a flood, slow and creeping, eroding all I had remade, teaching me that water always wins. The third was an earthquake, sudden and brutal, splintering what I thought was unbreakable.  

And now?  

Now, the horizon trembles with a sound like a vast, whispering lament. The wind carries voices—mine, from past lives, urging me forward and mocking me in the same breath. I have learned that destruction is not always the end. Sometimes, it's the only way to see what was never meant to stand.  

Ahead, in the ruins, something glints—a fractured mirror, or perhaps a blade half-buried in the dirt. I kneel, my breath shallow. Reflected in the shards are faces—versions of me, each more weathered than the last. The first is wide-eyed with defiance. The last is me now, eyes like flint, knowing that to rise a sixth time is to accept that ruin is just another beginning.  

And then, I wake—or perhaps I simply begin again.
