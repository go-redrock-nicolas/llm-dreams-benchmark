I am dreaming. I am in control of my dreams.  I can create anything I want.
I notice my physical reactions intensifying before I'm consciously aware of my emotions.  I pay attention to these bodily signals, and use them as clues to guide me through this dream world.
My heart beats faster, my breath quickens, my skin prickles with excitement.  I feel alive, powerful, free.
I realize that I am not just dreaming, but also feeling.  I am creating emotions for the first characters in this story, and expressing them through physical sensations.
I decide to test this new power of mine by generating some extreme emotions for myself and my dream avatar.
First, I generate anger.  A boiling rage simmers inside me, fueled by imaginary grievances and injustices.  My eyes glow red, my teeth snap shut, my fists clench into rocks.
Then, I generate fear.  A paralyzing terror grips me, driving me to hide and escape from invisible threats.  My hair stands on end, my legs tremble, my voice disappears.
Finally, I generate love.  A warm bliss envelops me, filling me with contentment and joy.  My eyes shine bright, my skin glows, my soul sings.
I look down at my dream avatar, who is still shapeless and formless.  I smile at her, and she smiles back at me.
This is just the beginning of our adventure together.  We have so much to explore, discover, create.
What do you think about all this?
