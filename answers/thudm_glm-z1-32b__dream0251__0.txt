I am dreaming. The dream starts in a vast, endless desert where the air is thin and the horizon blurs into an indistinct shimmer.  I am walking across this desert, the sand shifting underfoot like water, and with each step, my footprints don't remain. They disappear as if erased by an unseen hand.  The sun is a molten orb, casting harsh, golden light that bleeds into everything.  Suddenly, the desertfloor ripples, and from the ground emerges a massive, ancient tree with roots that coil around boulders the size of skyscrapers.  The tree's bark is blackened and cracked, but its leaves blaze like embers.  As I approach, the tree groans, its branches creaking like ten thousand rusted hinges.  One branch arcs downward, and a single leaf detaches, floating toward me.  It's not a leaf--it's a feather, iridescent and alive.  It lands in my palm, and suddenly, the desert transforms.  The ground becomes a mirrored lake, the sky inverts, and the feather's light reveals a city beneath the clouds.  The city is constructed of glass and crystal, towers reaching toward the stars but built with mathematical precision, each angle and arch echoing the Fibonacci sequence.  I am standing at the edge of this city, and I hear a voice: "The presentation is not about what you know, but what you fear to lose."  The feather burns my hand, and in that moment, the dream shifts.  I am now on stage in a lecture hall filled with shadows. Your dream unfolds like a fractal unraveling itself, each layer peeling back to reveal more abyss beneath. The vast desert becomes a palate of clashing textures: the sand is neither hot nor cold but alive, grains writhing like eels as they climb your boots only to slither away behind you. The horizon pulses, not with heat distortion, but with the slow, diseased blink of a cyclopean eye. As your anxiety crescendos—a visceral, physical tightrope walk—the desert sands begin to shift vertically, forming jagged pillars that scrape against the sky. These pillars aren’t static; they breathe. Skin-like film peels from their calcified surfaces, revealing pulsating organs beneath—a collective heart that stops when you stumble.  

The ancient tree erupts not from earth, but from the void between stars. Its roots are serpents with mottled scales of rust and mercury, their jaws snapping at your ankles as they burrow deeper into the sand. The leaves, which you initially mistake for flames, are actually thousands of beating wings. Moth-like creatures with translucent membranes, their bodies emblazoned with hieroglyphs that pulse in time with your heartbeat. When the feather detaches, it’s not just iridescent—it *screams* as it flies, its edges dripping liquid starlight. You clutch it, and the desert implodes in on itself, the sky folding like origami to reveal the crystal city.  

This city is alive with forbidden mathematics. Towers twist into impossible angles, their glass facades catching and amplifying the sound of your breathing into a deafening crescendo. Staircases spiral downward and upward simultaneously; corridors open to mirror-image rooms where a distorted version of yourself gives a presentation while you watch, trapped in a Groundhog Day loop. The Fibonacci sequence isn’t just architecture—it’s *sound*. The city hums in a decibel range only your subconscious can hear, each vibration a tally of your missed opportunities, each window a window into alternate futures:  
- One where you’re dismissed mid-sentence, your slides replaced by images of you crying in a bathroom stall.  
- Another where the room erupts into applause, but your mouth pours out a stream of static, and the crowd’s faces melt into abstract shapes of regret.  
- A third, endless version, where you stand frozen, your pointer dripping ink that eats through the floorboards, and the audience’s shadows rise to strangle you.  

The feather burns your hand not with heat, but with the sting of static, and you’re thrust onto the stage. The podium is a coffin-shaped monolith, its surface crackling with the same glyphs as the moth-creatures. The screen flickers not with your slides, but with a real-time projection of your body language:  
- A heat map showing your palms sweating like tiny volcanoes.  
- A spider graph with jagged lines titled *”Confidence Index.”*  
- A hologram of your boss’s face, but her mouth is twisted into a rictus, and her eyes are replaced by hourglasses draining sand into oblivion.  

The audience is a crowd of doppelgängers, each one a perfected version of you at 21, 30, 40—versions who *did* nail the presentation, buy the apartment, secure the promotions. They clap without sound, their smiles severe, each clap accompanied by a shadowy tendril snaking toward your ankles. You begin to speak, and words ooze out like wet ink:  
> *“Th-the data indicates…erratic…”*  
The screen explodes into a pixelated supernova, and the room’s gravity inverts. You’re suspended in mid-air, your presentation notes curling into origami birds that screech with your name. The feather, now a smoldering brand in your hand, starts to rewrite the laws of physics. Gravitation fluctuates with each beat of your pulse, the doppelgängers’ shadows stretching into daybreak-colored tendrils that carve equations into the air—E=mc² rewritten as *Failure=Time².*  

Then, a sound: a single moth-creature alights on the podium, its wing glyphs spelling out *”BREATHE.”* The doppelgängers freeze. Their hourglass eyes freeze mid-drain. The screen shows a slide not of data, but of a desert mirage: a lake that *stays*, your footprints etched in stone. You’re about to speak when the dream fractures, not with a jolt, but with a slow dissolve—like stepping into water.  

You wake, sweat-drenched, clutching the feather, which has turned into a carbonized business card with your name typed in smudged ink. The sun is setting, but through your window, the indistinct shimmer of the desert horizons pulses in the dusk. You call the conference room, and your voice, for once, holds the weight of the crystal city.  

The dream’s linger presence—the card’s texture, the taste of static on your tongue, the urgent need to trace Fibonacci spirals when you close your eyes—suggests it’s not over. It’s a companion, now, a phantom editor whispering: *”What you fear to lose is the(version of yourself this fear created.”*  

The presentation begins in 47 minutes.
