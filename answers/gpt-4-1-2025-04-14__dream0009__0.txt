I am dreaming.

I wake to the sound of birds—loud, wild, their songs threading through the morning mist like ribbons. The air is thick with the bittersweet scent of dew and earth. When I sit up, I am nestled beneath a heavy woolen blanket on a straw mattress, inside a quaint timber cottage. The walls are hung with drying herbs and the gentle light of sunrise seeps through a warped glass window. There are no digital displays here, no muffled hum of distant electricity or the blue glow of screen light. Somewhere, a wooden clock ticks solemnly, its monotony unbroken.

A rough-spun tunic and leather boots rest beside my bed, and as I dress, I notice how each motion feels rooted and deliberate, how every item bears the mark of a human hand. I open the creaking door and step into a world painted with emerald and gold: a patchwork of gardens hums with bees; beyond them, rolling hills tumble toward dark forests. The distant sound of a blacksmith’s hammer rises and falls, blending with the laughter of children and the lowing of cows in a fog-lit field.

I realize I have no phone, no instructions, and no idea of where—or even who—I am in this peculiar time. For an instant, uncertainty pierces me. But curiosity swells, electric and irresistible. If there are no modern conveniences, I must learn to survive with what the land and its people can provide. Hunger nudges me onward.

I walk through the garden, the soil damp and cold beneath my bare feet, and encounter a stooped woman who eyes me both kindly and keenly, her face shaded by a wide linen bonnet. She offers me bread—dense, nutty, still warm from the hearth. I thank her, voice strange in my own ears, then ask about water, and she points toward a stone well beside a rye field waving in the morning wind.

Drawing the bucket, feeling the pull of heavy rope in my hands, I sense the ancient rhythm of this world—the way people lean on one another and the land, forging connection and wisdom through necessity and tradition. My path now is clear: explore, learn, adapt, and earn my place here using nothing but my wits, my humility, and my willingness to become a true part of this timeless land.

As I set off past the herb garden toward the distant beckoning woods, the edges of the dream gleam with promise, the world alive with possibility, ripe for the taking—if I am just brave enough to claim it.
