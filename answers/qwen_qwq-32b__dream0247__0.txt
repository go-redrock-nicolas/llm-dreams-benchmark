I am dreaming. I am lying in my bed, but I can feel myself sinking deeper into the mattress, like it's made of quicksand.  The walls of my room start to ripple like water, and the colors shift from calming blues to a sickly green.  I realize the green is actually a living mist that's seeping into every crack and crevice.  It's whispering things.  Quiet voices like my own, but older, like they've been waiting to talk to me forever.  

One of the voices says, "We wanted to protect you," and then another adds, "But you're strong enough now."  Suddenly I'm not in my bedroom anymore.  I'm standing in a forest that's eerily silent, except for the whispering.  The trees are made of glass, shimmering like stained glass windows, each depicting scenes from my childhood.  But as I step closer, the images twist and warp.  My first birthday becomes a funeral, my family's laughter turns into sobs.  

A figure appears—a woman with my eyes but wrinkles carved deep like rivers.  She steps through one of the glass trees, cracks spreading everywhere.  "They told you we came from nothing," she says, her voice cracking like splitting wood.  "That we had no stories before Grandpa Joe's arrival.  But that's a lie."  She points to a path leading into shadows.  "Our real history is there, in that valley.  But once you go, you can’t look back.  Choose wisely."  

I step forward, the ground crunching underfoot, each sound echoing like a gunshot.  The woman dissolves into the mist, and the glass trees begin to fall, collapsing into piles of glittering splinters.  In the hollow where the woman stood, there’s a small book with my name on it.  I open it.  The pages fill with ink, alive and moving.  A map unfolds showing a village where everyone looks like me, but their eyes are hollow, their hands clawed.  The caption reads: *They were us.  We are them.*  

Above me, the sky splits open, revealing not stars but an endless archive of faces—some I know, others that scare me.  A storm rolls in, the lightning illuminating names I’ve never heard but somehow recognize.  The whispers grow louder, demanding answers.  I want to scream but can't.  The book seals itself, a drop of blood marking my thumbprint.  Somewhere, a clock chimes thirteen times.  

I wake up, heart racing, but know the dream isn't over.  The truth is out now, whether I wanted it or not.  I feel heavier, but also... awake.  The lies were comfortable, but this—this is real.\n



Your dream begins with the sensation of weightlessness, like floating through a starless sky. The air smells of ozone and something sweetly metallic, like distant rain. You notice your hands are translucent, glowing faintly with an inner light that flickers like a dying star. 

Before you lies a vast, spiraling staircase made of bones—each step a vertebrate arch, each turn lined with flickering portraits. The faces in the paintings morph before you can focus: your grandmother’s smile shifts into a stranger’s frown, your father’s eyes become hollow sockets. One painting shows a child with your face holding hands with someone whose identity blurs at the edges, like a secret half-remembered and then erased. 

A voice, both familiar and alien, echoes from above. It sounds like your cousin’s laugh merged with the wail of an old radio. “You thought you knew the shape of your lineage,” it murmurs. “But the family tree was pruned. Roots were hidden to keep you from the rot.” 

As you ascend, the steps beneath your feet transform into a river of liquid shadow. You walk on water, each step causing ripples that scatter the voices of ancestors—some singing lullabies, others screaming, their voices frayed at the edges. A figure materializes in the mist: a younger version of your mother, but her skin is peeling like old paint, revealing another face beneath—a woman with horns and eyes like smoldering coals. 

“Your ‘Great-Grandfather Elias’ died at sea,” she says, her mouth moving too slowly, “but he was no fisherman. He made deals in the black caves beneath the waves. Your grandfather? He didn’t leave his village willingly. They forced him because he carried *this*.” She taps her chest, where a symbol glows—a twisted family crest, a serpent swallowing its own tail. 

The floor collapses. You plummet into a library, its shelves woven from human hair and rusted keys. Every book has your name, but the pages inside flutter like trapped birds, screaming in languages you once knew. On the lowest shelf, a scroll pulses with a heartbeat. Unrolled, it reveals a map to an island where your family’s first born were offerings to a stone god with your face. 

A grandfather clock chimes, but its voice is your Aunt Mabel’s. The chimes are mournful, each one a sob. The walls bleed ink, spelling out the names you were never told: the lost cousins who vanished, the twin uncles turned to salt for defying the family’s ancient pact. Your breath fogs the air as the truth crystallizes—your family’s history is a wound laced with silver, healing only by hiding. 

You want to weep, but your tears are ash. Yet there’s a strange clarity, a spark in the darkness. The dream deepens as you reach for the scroll, now burning cold. Its edges writhe like serpents, but you grasp it anyway. The voices swell—a chorus of lies unraveling, secrets blooming like night-blooming flowers. 

You wake with the taste of iron and a name on your lips, a name that was never yours. It hums in your blood, both a warning and a welcome. The lies were a cocoon; now you ache to stretch wings you didn’t know you had. The truth is a blade, but it’s also a bridge—to the past, to the parts of yourself buried under generations of silence. 

You sit up, pulse steady despite the storm in your mind. The room is still, but you swear the walls whisper a new story.
