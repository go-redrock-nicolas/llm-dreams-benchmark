I am dreaming. You are dreaming. At first, the world around you is a blur of pastel light, as if someone spread sunrise across the sky and whispered it into your senses. Then the colors sharpen, and you find your feet planted on a floor made of living marble—veins of liquid gold pulsing beneath a skin of snow-white stone. All around, floating lanterns carved from opalescent shells drift like friendly jellyfish, glowing softly. Every breath you take smells of honeyed jasmine and ozone.  

Suddenly, you feel it: a quiet, humming certainty at the center of your mind, as if some ancient compass has clicked into place. You know—without a shred of doubt—the exact, perfect move to make in this world. A vast labyrinth appears before you, its walls rippling like quicksilver, each corridor lined with shifting hieroglyphs you can’t quite read but somehow understand. Feeling this strange confidence in your untested abilities, you lift your hand and trace a single symbol in the air. Instantly, the corridor tilts, the walls slide aside, and a staircase of gleaming onyx reveals itself.  

You ascend. With each step, your intuition refines itself: not only do you see the path, you feel the precise angle at which each stair must be climbed to avoid traps; you hear the silent click of gears releasing far below; you even sense the heartbeat of a guardian living in the stone. At the top, a massive door awaits—carved with a thousand interlocking runes. Others have tried brutish force or maddening riddles; you need neither. Calmly, you close your eyes for a moment, letting the dream’s deep currents wash through you. In your mind’s eye, the runes slide into place like celestial gears meshing. You open your eyes and press the final rune home.  

The door swings open to reveal a vast sky-realm: floating islands topped with silver trees that hum when the wind passes through their leaves. On the nearest island, a creature made of starlight crouches—an anxious being who’s been waiting, hoping someone would free it. You step forward, unwavering in your resolve, and instantly discover the precise tone to sing that will soothe its fear, the perfect words to heal any ancient wound it carries. As your voice fills the air, the creature’s fur of twinkling light softens, its eyes brighten, and it transforms into a guardian spirit who bows before you in gratitude.  

In that exalted silence, you realize your intuition is not just a tool but a gift: a bridge between imagination and truth. The dream ripples around you in celebration—lanterns spin into miniature galaxies, marble veins of gold blossom outward like sunbursts, the jasmine-ozone fragrance grows intoxicating. Then, as gently as a ripple on a sleeping lake, you feel yourself pull away. The last thing you hear is your own heartbeat, steady and sure, carrying a memory of perfect solutions and impossible beauty into the waking world.
