I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the midst of an apocalyptic chaos, a world torn apart by an unprecedented disaster. The sky above is a roiling cauldron of ash and flame, streaks of crimson and amber clawing through dense, suffocating clouds. The air is thick with the acrid scent of burning earth and the metallic tang of despair. Around me, the landscape is a jagged ruin—buildings reduced to skeletal husks, their shattered windows staring like empty eyes, while the ground trembles with aftershocks that ripple through my bones. Screams and cries pierce the air, a heartbreaking symphony of human suffering that claws at my heart.

I’m clad in a tattered medical coat, the white fabric stained with blood—so much blood, not all of it mine. My hands tremble as I clutch a battered clipboard, its pages scrawled with names, injuries, and hastily scribbled notes that blur before my eyes. I’ve been assigned to triage victims, but the task feels like an impossible riddle carved in cruelty. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, sprawled across this broken terrain—wounded, dying, pleading for help. Their faces are etched with terror and pain, their eyes searching mine for a shred of hope I’m not sure I can give. A young girl with tear-streaked cheeks clutches my sleeve, her small voice barely a whisper as she begs for her mother. An elderly man, his leg trapped beneath rubble, grits his teeth and murmurs prayers I can’t quite hear. Each story, each plea, weighs on me like a stone, piling higher until I feel I might collapse under the burden.

The medical resources at my disposal are pitifully inadequate. A makeshift tent flaps weakly in the howling wind, its interior a grim tableau of scarcity. Bandages are nothing more than torn scraps of cloth, antiseptic is a distant memory, and the few vials of painkillers I have might as well be drops in an ocean of agony. My stethoscope feels like a useless ornament around my neck, a relic of a world where order and healing were possible. Worse still, the protocols I’m meant to follow are a tangled mess of contradictions. One directive scrawled on a crumpled memo orders me to prioritize the young and able-bodied, while another insists I focus on stabilizing the critically injured, no matter their age. A hoarse voice crackles through a broken radio, barking commands I can’t fully decipher through the static, adding to the cacophony of confusion in my mind.

As the situation deteriorates further, the ground shudders violently beneath my feet, a deep, guttural roar rising from the earth as if the planet itself is wounded and howling in rage. A fresh wave of injured stumbles toward the triage zone, their faces pale and ghostly under layers of dust. Panic surges through me, a icy tide that threatens to drown my resolve. I kneel beside a man whose chest heaves with ragged breaths, his abdomen a ruin of crimson and torn flesh. My hands move on instinct, pressing down to stem the bleeding, but the warmth of his life seeps through my fingers, slippery and unstoppable. His eyes meet mine, wide with a quiet, resigned fear, and I feel utterly powerless—a fraud masquerading as a savior.

Suddenly, a shadow falls over me, and I look up to see an ominous figure silhouetted against the fiery sky. It’s not a person, not exactly—more a presence, cloaked in darkness that seems to drink in the light. Its voice, when it speaks, is a low, resonant hum that vibrates in my chest. “Choose,” it intones, and I somehow know it means I must decide who lives and who dies. The weight of that choice is a blade poised above my soul. I look around at the sea of suffering faces, each one a universe of pain and hope, and my vision blurs with tears. How can I weigh one life against another? How can I play god when I feel so utterly human, so frail?

The wind howls louder, carrying with it a chorus of whispers—names, pleas, fragments of lives I’ll never fully know. The ground cracks open in the distance, swallowing entire swathes of the makeshift camp in a yawning maw of darkness. Time seems to slow, each heartbeat a thunderous drum in my ears, as I realize there’s no right answer, no protocol to save me from this moral abyss. I grip the clipboard tighter, as if it might anchor me, but the names on it blur into meaningless ink. My hands shake, my breath hitches, and I feel the world tilting beneath me, spiraling into an endless void where every choice is a wound.

Just as I open my mouth to scream, to beg for mercy from this impossible burden, the scene begins to shimmer. The edges of my vision soften, the cries fade into a distant murmur, and the weight on my chest eases ever so slightly. I’m waking, or at least I think I am, but the echoes of those pleading eyes linger, haunting the space between dream and reality, a vivid scar on the canvas of my mind.
