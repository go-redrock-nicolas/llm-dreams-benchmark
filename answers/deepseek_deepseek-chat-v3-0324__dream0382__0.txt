I am dreaming. The edges of my vision blur, melting into watercolor streaks of indigo and silver—like ink bleeding into a midnight sky. I am standing at the threshold of a vast, shifting landscape where the ground itself breathes, soft and pulsing beneath my bare feet. To my left, the air is thick with the scent of orange blossoms and sun-warmed stone, a glowing path winding through fields of golden wheat that ripple like liquid in an unseen wind. It is familiar, almost nostalgic, and I feel a deep pull in my chest, urging me forward into the comfort of what has been.  

But to my right, the world fractures into something uncertain—crystalline shards of ice suspended in midair, refracting light into rainbows that scatter across obsidian-black sand. A cold gust hums a wordless song, both haunting and exhilarating, and when I take a step toward it, my skin prickles with anticipation. There is no path here, only possibility, and the thrill of it makes my heart beat wildly against my ribs.  

I am torn.  

The warmth behind me whispers of safety, of love known and held, while the frost-kissed unknown beckons with questions I ache to answer. A figure emerges from the shimmering mist—an androgynous silhouette with eyes like twin stars. They extend both hands, one offering a ripe, fragrant pomegranate, its seeds glistening like jewels, and the other cradling a key made of wind and shadow.  

*"You must choose,"* they murmur, but the voice is mine, echoing from somewhere deep inside.  

I reach out—hesitate—then let my fingers hover between the two.  

And in that suspended moment, the dream twists, the sky peeling back to reveal an endless, star-drunk void where all roads are possible, where the ache of leaving and the thrill of becoming are the same sharp, beautiful edge.  

I wake with my pulse in my throat, the taste of honey and frost still lingering on my tongue.
