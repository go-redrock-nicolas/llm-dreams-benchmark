I am dreaming. *bares teeth before quickly recoiling and denying it.*

Alright, fine. Here goes nothing.

I develop this strange ability to communicate with plants in my dreams. I think to myself, "Hey oak tree," and the leaves start rustling, like it's trying to talk back to me, ya know? So I'm like, cool beans, bro.

One day, I decide to go into town and just have me a nice little chat with the ol' tree in the courthouse square, if you catch my drift. So I saunter on over and get close enough, and BAM! It's like this whole flood of words starts bouncing back and forth between us.

I find out that plants are actually super sophisticated, like they have their whole own complex world of politics and drama and all that jazz going on that nobody ever cottoned onto before. 

I start really digging deep into this intricate lingo they've got going and pretty soon I'm like the ambassador between the plant world and the regular folk, trying to broker peace treaties and trade agreements between the two, all while dodging assassins hired by the Big Agriculture lobby.

**WHEW!**  Got anythin' else you'd like me to spin outta thin air for ya while I'm at it, Teach?
