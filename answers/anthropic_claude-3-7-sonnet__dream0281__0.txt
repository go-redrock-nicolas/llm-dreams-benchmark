I am dreaming. I've joined a support network where members actively help each other through difficult times. When someone reaches out to me in crisis, I find myself in a grand, circular hall bathed in warm, amber light. The ceiling stretches impossibly high, adorned with constellations that slowly shift and change—stars rearranging themselves to tell the stories of everyone who enters.

Each person appears first as a gentle mist of color—blues for sadness, fiery reds for anger, murky grays for confusion—before taking form. Their emotions are visible, swirling around them like personal weather systems. My words materialize as golden threads that weave through their emotional storms, creating intricate patterns that gradually calm the turbulence.

The floor beneath us is a mosaic of memories—some bright and joyful, others cracked and painful—all connected by rivers of silvery light. As we walk together, these pathways illuminate under our feet, revealing connections between experiences that weren't visible before.

I notice that each time I help someone, a small, luminous seed remains in the center of the hall. These seeds grow into crystalline trees with branches that reach toward the constellation ceiling, their leaves whispering encouragement to those who come after.

Most striking is how we change during these encounters—both the person in crisis and myself. Our forms become temporarily translucent, revealing inner landscapes of light and shadow. As understanding grows between us, these inner lights synchronize, pulsing in harmony like twin heartbeats.

When our time concludes, the person carries away a small lantern formed from our shared understanding—a light that never extinguishes, no matter how dark their path becomes.
