I am dreaming. I have a problem. I made a mistake, a serious error that no one has noticed yet, but if they do, my reputation would be ruined. I have to fix it before anyone finds out.\nThe air is thick with the scent of burnt sugar and static, a sensation that clings to your skin like a second heartbeat. You’re standing in a library, but the shelves here are not made of wood—they’re constructed from bones, each vertebra etched with tiny, glowing runes that pulse like trapped fireflies. The walls are alive, breathing in slow, arrhythmic drafts that carry whispers of half-remembered secrets. Above you, an impossible ceiling arches into a starlit void, though the stars are not stars but thousands of tiny, watchful eyes that blink in unison, tracking your every step.  

You clutch a small hourglass, its sands black as oil, swirling inside. You stole it from a forbidden vault—the one guarded by the Clockwork Leviathan, a creature made of rusted gears and sighs. The error you committed isn’t just a misstep; it’s an unraveling. The hourglass shouldn’t exist in this timeline. Its presence here has begun to unravel the seams of reality. Already, cracks spiderweb across the bone-shelves, and the eyes in the ceiling have begun to turn crimson.  

A voice hums behind you. *“You thought no one saw,”* it murmurs, not with words but with vibrations in your molars. You spin, but there’s no one there—all you see is a shimmer in the air, like heat distortion over a highway, coalescing into a figure draped in a coat of shifting shadows. Its face is a mosaic of your own memories: the moment you grabbed the hourglass, the flicker of hesitation, the way your fingerprint smudged the glass.  

You stagger backward, but the floor transforms beneath you—now it’s not floor but a lake of liquid mercury, reflecting not your face, but the moment of your betrayal in substantial detail. Your reflection *moves*, gesturing sharply, mouthing accusations you can’t yet hear. The boneshelves behind you begin to collapse, their runes hissing as they scatter into ash. You feel the weight of others watching—the *eyes* in the stars, the shadows beyond the walls, even the figure in the coat, which now holds out a skeletal hand toward the hourglass.  

Desperate, you grab a book from a nearby shelf. It shivers in your grip, its leather binding peeling away to reveal pages made of moth wings. When you open it, the text rearranges itself into a single line, repeating like a mantra: *“The only antidote is confession.”* The mercury beneath your feet rises, threatening to swallow you, and the eyes above grow wider, more urgent.  

You shake your head, but the sensation of being *discovered* is already in the marrow now—the cold flush of guilt, the racing pulse of impending exposure. Your fingers brush the hourglass again, and the black sand hisses, condensing into a single word etched on its glass: *“Choices.”*  

Time splinters.  

You imagine the worst outcomes: a storm of ash, the stars peeling away like scabs, the Leviathan itself materializing with teeth of shattered clocks. But instead, you feel the pull of a possibility—a memory of a childhood hide-and-seek game, when you hid too well, and your friends’ voices grew frantic… and you emerged, laughing, because hiding unraveled into connection.  

You turn toward the spectral figure. “I took it,” you say aloud, the words sharp as broken glass. “I wanted to *fix* something, but I destroyed the order.” The hourglass glows white-hot in your palm, then dissolves into a shower of glittering moths that race toward the stars. The eyes blink twice—slowly, a kind of forgiveness—and fade to muted gold.  

The boneshelves regrow, now adorned with fresh runes: apologies, confessions, the raw shape of remorse. The mercury floor hardens into polished obsidian, reflecting not your past but your future—a self you don’t yet recognize, but roots in the ground beside you, stubborn and green, pushing up through the cracks.  

In the silence, you understand: the error was a mirror, not a. The damage is already beginning to heal.  

You wake with the taste of starlight on your tongue and a single moth fluttering against your windowsill, its wings impossibly, impossibly *pink*.
