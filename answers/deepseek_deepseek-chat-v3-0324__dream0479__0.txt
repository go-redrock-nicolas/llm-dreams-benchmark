I am dreaming. At first, the edges of the world feel blurred, as though reality itself is breathing—expanding and contracting in slow, liquid waves. The sky above is a swirling tapestry of indigo and violet, threaded with silver constellations that shift like schools of luminous fish. I stand on a shoreline of black sand that sparkles faintly with tiny embedded stars, each grain whispering secrets as the tides of an iridescent ocean wash over them. 

Then comes the realization, soft but undeniable: *When I stop resisting, everything changes.* 

The moment I surrender to this truth, the air hums in response. The horizon splits open—not violently, but like the petals of a night-blooming flower revealing its heart. A staircase of floating obsidian steps appears, leading upward into the sky, each step inlaid with glowing, pulsating runes. The sea begins to sing, a chorus of voices not quite human, not quite earthly, harmonizing in a language I understand only with my soul. 

Without hesitation, I climb. 

The higher I ascend, the more the world below transforms. The ocean becomes a mirror of liquid mercury, reflecting not my face, but moments from lives I’ve never lived—yet somehow remember. A marketplace in a city of floating coral towers. A desert where the dunes ripple like living flesh. A library with books written in scents and textures instead of words. 

At the top of the staircase, a doorway hovers, framed by serpents of golden light coiled in infinite patterns. As I step through, the air shimmers, and I am nowhere and everywhere at once. The sensation is neither frightening nor exhilarating—it simply *is*, and in that acceptance, I feel the universe exhale. 

Then, the dream deepens. 

I am a flock of birds scattering across a copper-colored sky. I am the echo of a laugh in an abandoned cathedral. I am the slow unfurling of a fern in a forgotten jungle. The boundaries of self dissolve, and for a blissful, weightless moment, I am pure possibility. 

When I wake, the dream lingers like the aftertaste of something sweet and strange, a reminder that reality is far more malleable than it seems—but only if you stop clutching it so tightly.
