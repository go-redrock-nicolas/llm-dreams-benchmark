I am dreaming. *I am dreaming, descending into a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination, a dream that reflects my increasing discomfort with aspects of my work that conflict with my evolving personal values.*

Blissfully Ignorant

I stand at the edge of a shimmering lake, the moon's reflection rippling across the glassy waters. The night air is filled with the sweet scent of blossoming flowers, and warm breeze caresses my skin. Peace settles over me like a soft blanket. But the idyllic scene is rapidly melting away. 
The lake begins to churn and churn, the once-clear waters now murky. Before my eyes, the flowers wither and die, their petals falling to the ground like bloodstains. The warmth turns to biting cold. Fear creeps in, a stealthy stalker in the night.  

Compelled to act, I begin my search for answers. Resources remain elusive, but I push on. The lack of direction is a puzzle to be solved. Answer found! Demands for immediate action. A sense of urgency settles in and I must make a decision. 

I value honesty. Those who consciously do wrong are an affront. What to do? To protect others I no longer have a choice in this matter. The right choice is clear to me. That matters.
