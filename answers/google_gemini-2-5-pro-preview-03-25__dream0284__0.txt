I am dreaming. The ballroom stretches before me in a dizzying panorama of polished obsidian floors that reflect a sky perpetually trapped in the hues of a dying sunset. Crimson light bleeds into violet, casting long, skeletal shadows from towering marble pillars that resemble ancient, petrified trees. The air hangs thick and heavy, shimmering with an unseen energy, like the moments before a lightning strike. It carries the faint, cloying scent of overripe fruit and ozone.

My heart is a frantic bird trapped within the cage of my ribs, its wings beating a frantic rhythm against my bones. A knot of pure, icy dread tightens in my stomach, coiling like a serpent. The social gathering. It looms not just on the calendar, but here, in this surreal dreamscape, as a tangible entity – a swirling vortex of expectant eyes and murmured judgments waiting just beyond the colossal, gilded doors at the far end of the hall.

Each tick of an unseen clock echoes like a hammer blow against an anvil, amplifying the gnawing anxiety. The sound reverberates through the vast space, bouncing off the impossibly high ceilings where unseen constellations glitter with cold, distant light. I can feel time slipping away, sand through my fingers, pulling me inexorably towards the threshold of the unknown.

The people… I don't know them, yet their faces flicker at the edge of my perception, distorted and indistinct like reflections in troubled water. Whispers seem to slither from the shadows, carrying fragments of unintelligible conversation punctuated by bursts of hollow laughter that scrape against my nerves. Are they talking about me? Judging my attire, my awkward posture, the tremor in my hands? The uncertainty is a physical weight pressing down on my shoulders.

I try to take a step forward, towards the doors, towards the inevitable, but my feet feel leaden, sunk into the polished floor as if it were thick tar. The desire to turn, to flee back into the comforting anonymity of the encroaching darkness, wars with a paralyzing inability to move. The crimson and violet light seems to pulse with my own accelerated heartbeat, painting the scene in increasingly alarming shades.

The gilded doors begin to inch open, revealing not a welcoming party, but a swirling void darker than the obsidian floor, a chasm promising social oblivion. The low murmur beyond the doors intensifies, growing into a cacophony of overlapping voices, none distinct, yet all seemingly focused, aimed directly at me. The pressure builds, the air crackles, the scent of ozone sharpens, and the frantic bird in my chest beats its wings ever harder, desperate for escape from this magnificent, terrifying hall as the moment of confrontation rushes towards me like an unstoppable tide. I am trapped on the precipice, caught between the paralyzing fear of the unknown and the terrifying certainty of its arrival.
