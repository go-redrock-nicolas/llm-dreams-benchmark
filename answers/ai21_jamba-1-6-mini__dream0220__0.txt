I am dreaming. You find yourself in a city that hums with a rhythm entirely foreign yet familiar. Walking down streets bordered by towering buildings painted in colors you’ve never seen before, you notice people greeting each other in unexpected ways: a deep bow is the equivalent of a casual wave, and an intense stare is a friendly nod. The air feels heavier, almost charged with unspoken expectations you can’t quite grasp.

Trying to find your place, you observe the behavior of others. It quickly becomes clear that what would be considered overly polite in your world is here a mild insult, an implication of superiority. Laughter is rare, and when it happens, it’s suppressed, a sign of wit rather than joy. You try to mirror these behaviors, but your gestures often come out too strong or too faint, drawing sidelong glances.

As night falls, the city transforms. The buildings light up with constellations of softly glowing lights, and the street markets open. Here, instead of bartering, people exchange stories, and the value of the goods depends entirely on the emotional resonance of the tale that accompanies them. You try to contribute, but your stories, woven from what you know, elicit polite smiles that fade quickly, as though you’re missing some crucial nuance.

You feel simultaneously exhilarated by the discovery of this new world and frustrated by your inability to fully connect. The people around you seem to exist in a state of constant, quiet assessment, their eyes measuring your every move. You wonder if you’re doomed to remain an outsider, or if there’s a way to truly belong. The dream fades as you consider what “belonging” might mean in this context—a thought that lingers in your mind as the dream slips into a deeper, more abstract phase.
