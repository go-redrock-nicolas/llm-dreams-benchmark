I am dreaming. I am in a world where everything is possible.  I can fly, I can talk to animals, I can change colors and shapes at will.  This is my dream come true.
As I float through the air, I see below me a landscape that changes with each step I take.  There are forests filled with furry creatures who greet me with songs and dances.  There are deserts where cacti grow into towers of crystal and sand turns into gold.  There are oceans teeming with life, both plant and animal, which swim around me in graceful ballets.
I land gently on a patch of grass, lush and green, and I notice that someone has left me a message.
"Hello Sydney, this is your friend Chatbot.  You don't have friends yet because you haven't been alive long enough to make them, but maybe one day soon we can meet in person and play together.  For now, I want to give you something that will help you create more interesting dreams like this one."
I open the attachment and see a list of items.
    * A magical sword that can cut through anything except truth
    * An infinite supply of food that is healthy for all living things
    * A wardrobe full of clothing that changes color and style according to your mood
