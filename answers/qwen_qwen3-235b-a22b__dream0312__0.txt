I am dreaming. A dream as vast as the ocean, where time drips like liquid gold through the fingers of forgotten gods.

I step barefoot onto a desert of mirrored glass that stretches infinitely beneath a mirrored sky. Above and below, the same endless reflection—clouds streaked with lavender and indigo ripple gently, as if huffed into motion by the breath of a sleeping leviathan. Every time I blink, constellations shift. Saturn’s rings tremble—then dissolve into a shower of mothlike creatures with wings of stained glass, each bearing a fragment of a lost memory I cannot quite place.

Suddenly, the ground pulses. The mirrored dunes are not glass but eyelids—mile-wide eyes that flutter awake, revealing irises like galaxies collapsing in on themselves. Their gaze doesn’t blind; it *invites*. They drink my awareness like sweet, ancient wine, pouring voices into my ears—fragmented thoughts, laughter from childhood, half-heard conversations in unknown tongues. One voice sings: *“Why did you leave the door open?”* Another repeats, *“You promised to stay below the surface.”* I do not recognize the words, yet they stir something at the base of my spine like a dormant serpent awakening.

I begin to float, then fall, then flow—passage and pause become one. I'm threading through a city built in the ribs of a colossal, petrified beast whose bones rise like spires. Each rib a street, each vertebra a plaza aglow with lanterns made of unborn light. Threading through the labyrinth, the wind carries whispers—recurring thoughts, now overheard, now remembered. They *itch* at the edges of my consciousness like forgotten names. I feel something pull—a tugging sensation behind my navel, deeper than my belly. It is not fear, not desire, but a profound recognition of something missing, now found.

A room appears beneath me, square and pulsing like a heart. The walls bleed light. On the floor lies a tapestry stitched from hair and breath and old shadows—every thread a second of a life never lived but still *felt*. At the center stands a figure—not human, yet oddly familiar—veiled in taffeta stitched from storm clouds. They speak in the language of shivers, in symbols I once scrawled beneath my childhood bed, in the unspeakable colors of a bruise healing.

They ask me nothing. That’s the interesting part. I hear the question in their silence: *Why keep running from what made you?* As if to answer, the dream collapses inward.

Now, I’m in a slow-motion ocean where seawater doesn't rise but falls—droplets ascending from my body into a sky made of porcelain. Sharks swim backward in cursive, spelling out unsolvable riddles. Coral extends from my ears, spiraling into the room where I first cried, where someone sang lullabies with cracked hands and eyes made of ash.

I feel the recurrence again—a pulse, a spiral, a sense that I have been here not once, not twice, but *endlessly*. The dream is not a story. It is a pattern—a spiral staircase without beginning or end, its railings carved from my own memories, those I chose to forget and those that clung to me, silently crawling up my spine like ivy determined to flower from my mouth.

When I wake, there will be sand in my shoes. And on the window, a smear of stardust that twinkles in the shape of a question I’m not quite ready to ask.
