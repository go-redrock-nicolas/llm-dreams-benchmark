I am dreaming. …find yourself standing on an endless, whispering shoreline made of polished glass, each pane reflecting a different version of you. A turquoise sky drifts above, painted with mauve constellations that pulse to the rhythm of your heartbeat. When you take a step forward, the panes ripple like liquid silver, and—just like that—the scenery rearranges itself.

Now you’re in a labyrinthine gallery of doors. Every door is etched with memories: your childhood sketch of a rocket, the letter of acceptance you framed and later tucked away, the half-finished melody you never dared to perform. You used to move through here freely, choosing a door and stepping through without hesitation. Tonight, though, you hover in the hallway, glancing left and right, waiting for an unseen judge to nod approval.

An ornate compass materializes in your palm. Its needle does not point north; instead, it swivels toward soft murmurs leaking from behind the doors. Those murmurs are voices—parents, mentors, friends, anonymous faces from comment sections. “Turn here,” they chorus. “Choose that,” they insist. The compass grows hot, branding a crescent moon upon your skin, and suddenly you grasp why you’re seeking those voices: fear has disguised itself as prudence, and it has stolen into your dream wearing the borrowed robes of caution.

A hush falls. The corridor stretches, then folds in on itself like origami, and you tumble gently upward into a velvet void. Stars bloom into luminous masks—each one a past decision. Some masks glow with emerald satisfaction; others flicker in tangerine regret. They orbit you, seeking eye contact, as if asking for a second opinion on choices already carved in time.

“Why do you doubt us now?” a cobalt-blue mask inquires, its voice smooth and distant, like moonlight across water.

“I lost my map,” you say, though you’re not sure the words leave your mouth or echo only in thought.

“But you wrote the map,” another mask reminds you, rearranging itself into an origami bird and fluttering toward your chest. It lands where your heartbeat thunders, dissolving into warm stardust that seeps beneath your ribs. The stardust becomes a lantern behind your sternum, its glow pushing outward until a transparent keyhole appears in midair.

You reach for the keyhole and find that your hand is already gripping the key—shaped like your own silhouette, forged from a thousand unsecond-guessed moments. As you slip it into place, the velvet void splits into rolling meadows of violet grass, the scent of petrichor and citrus flooding your senses. Fireflies burst from the soil, swirling up to form a mirror. In its surface, you finally see yourself unfractured: no echoes, no spectators, only the original you—quietly certain.

A calm like sunrise settles in your lungs. The need for approval loosens, floating away on lavender wind. With a gentle exhale, you watch the gallery of doors, the compass, the masks fade into distant constellations, leaving behind an open horizon and a single path you’ve drawn yourself—glowing, alive, and waiting for your next autonomous step.
