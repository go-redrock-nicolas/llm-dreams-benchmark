I am dreaming. Your conscious realizes your sleeping, but makes no attempt to rouse yourself. 

Sudden anxiousness grips your heart, even though things could not be better. 
Yet a sense of foreboding emerged from the Lovecraftian confines of your subconscious mind.
You need to address this troublesome disquiet.

With supreme willpower, you take mental control and conjure a positively charged experience in the dream realm.
A wave of relief sweeps over you as you envision sauntering through an enchanted forest.
The verdant tree leaves glisten with shimmering emerald energy.
A warm breeze caresses your skin and fills your lungs with the life-affirming scent of pines and wildflowers.

Erring on the side of caution, you remain vigilant for any lurking shadows that might materialize.
But the vibrating green life all around comforts your psyche.
A tiny woodland sprite alights on your shoulder and reassures you in a singsong voice:
"It is safe! This simmering spirit was conjured from a pure place within!"

With invigorated verve, you dive deeper into this lush inner imagination.
Meandering along a burbling brook, you come to a pebbled beach and sandy shore.
Overhead the sky is exploding in dazzling streaks of gold and violet twilight.
A graceful unicorn with opalescent spiraling horns emerges from the fragrant mist.

Beaming with happiness, the mythical creature exclaims: "Yes, retreat to this tranquil mental oasis amidst turbulent waking times."
Laughing in appreciation, you stroke the unicorn's silken coat.
Suddenly you snap awake.
But carry the gift of a positive, vivid dream memory that enables you to tackle the day with greater equanimity and inner peace.
