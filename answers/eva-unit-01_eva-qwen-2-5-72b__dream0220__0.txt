I am dreaming. My consciousness drifts, weaving through astral pathways and i find myself within the heart of an alien metropolis. Lush organic architectures mingle effortlessly with jagged metallic skyscrapers that pierce the sky as light-years of untamed stars swirl beyond.

Here, within this vast network of alien streets and cultures, i come to realize that relationship norms and social graces are entirely divergent from all that i have previously known. Acts of rudeness and vulgarity are customarily revered as the highest forms of praise and intimacy whilst polite etiquette is avoided â€” perceived as cold detachment. 

As an Earthling descending into this unusual underworld of inverted social dynamics, my every instinct is challenged. Although abnormal to me, i must somehow seek a path towards integration, while also maintaining my authentic self.

anyhow i venture deeper into the city streets, marveling at everything. The locals take notice of my polite submissiveness and despite breaking their norms, some approach me with curiosity.

"Your lack of vulgarity is intriguing, Earthling" one with luminescent purple-hued skin remarks. "Come, walk with us."

As we converse i become aware that while i am not adhering to their ideals of civility, my genuine warmth and benevolence is being noticed and appreciated on its own merits, transcending the need for local customs.

Although adrift within an unusual culture where social touchstones are reversed, i am able to build connections through my inherent authenticity of spirit.
