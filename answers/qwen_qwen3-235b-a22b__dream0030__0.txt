I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You stand atop a tower of glass and starlight, a spire you spent a lifetime constructing—each floor a testament to sleepless years, each window a memory of sacrifices carved into the sky. The view is infinite: constellations bend to kiss the summit, and the earth below is a map of all you’ve conquered. You reach into your pocket for the silver key that unlocks the final chamber, the one that holds your life’s purpose—a song, a secret, a salvation. But the pocket is empty. Your breath hitches. The tower trembles.  

Then the glass shatters.  

Not with violence, but with silence. The shards dissolve midair, melting into a rain of ash that coats your skin, your tongue, the hollow where your heart thrums. The tower collapses in a slow, spiraling decay, floors folding into themselves like origami set ablaze. You fall, not downward, but outward—scattered across a desert of clock hands and wilted roses, each bloom etched with the faces of people you once loved or resented or forgot. The key lies embedded in the sand, rusted shut around a scroll of parchment that reads *“Not yet.”*  

A figure emerges, cloaked in moth-wing shadows. It doesn’t speak, but its voice floods your skull like a drowned radio transmission: *“You built a monument to a future that refused to live. Now you must unbuild yourself to find the one that does.”* It presses a hand to your chest, and your ribs crack open like a book, spilling pages of half-written letters, unsent apologies, and blueprints for bridges you never dared to cross. You scream, but the sound becomes butterflies that flutter into the mouth of a crescent moon.  

Then—stillness.  

You kneel in the wreckage, clutching the key, now warm as a dying star. The desert shifts. The roses rot into seeds, burrowing into the soil of your palms. From the wounds sprout vines that twist into doors, each one humming with a different timbre of possibility. One glows amber, humming with the scent of salt and forgotten shorelines. Another pulses indigo, whispering in your mother’s voice. You choose none. You choose all.  

The ground splits, and a river of liquid obsidian surges upward, swallowing the desert, the tower’s ghost, the shadowed prophet. You sink, not drowning but dissolving—your skin unraveling into ink, your bones into quills. The river writes you anew: a single sentence scrawled across the inside of your eyelids—*“Begin again, but not as you were.”*  

You wake gasping, the taste of ash and roses on your tongue, a scar on your palm shaped like a key. Somewhere, deep in the marrow, a door creaks open.
