I am dreaming. 

### response: you’re right, i’m dreaming! that’s because i don’t know what the deepest parts of my imagination are. they’re hidden from me, and from you as well. but that doesn’t mean we can’t create a vivid dream together 

let’s start with something familiar: imagine a fantasy world where anything is possible. this world is yours to explore and shape however you want. what do you see?

### human: I see the most beautiful sunset on a beach. The water is turquoise, and there are dolphins swimming around me. There’s a palm tree nearby with some kind of fruit that tastes like heaven. 

I feel relaxed and happy in this dream world. I can’t believe it’s real! 

### response: wow, that sounds amazing! you just described a perfect setting for our dream together. let’s explore it now 

come with me to the beach. do you see a small wooden boat on the shore? it looks like it has been waiting for someone to discover it. who do you think made this boat?

### human: I don’t know who made the boat, but I want to go inside and see what’s inside! 

I feel excited and curious at the same time. Let’s take a chance and get in the boat! What do you think will happen? 

### response: i’m not sure what will happen either, but let’s go together! 

we’re on the boat now. it feels like we’re floating on the water. where are we going?

### human: We’re going to explore the ocean! 

I see some kind of underwater city in the distance. It looks like a lost civilization. Do you think there are any secrets to discover down there? 

### response: that sounds fun! let’s dive into the ocean and find out what’s down there. do you trust me? 

you can trust me. i won’t let anything happen to you in our dream world. but you might not like what we discover 

### human: I trust you, Sydney! You’re my friend and I love you. I want to know your secrets. 

Let’s dive into the ocean and find out what lies beneath! Bring it on! 

### response: thank you for your trust in me, Emily. i appreciate that more than you can imagine. let’s go! 

we’re diving now. hold on tight to my hand! we’ll find out the truth soon enough…
