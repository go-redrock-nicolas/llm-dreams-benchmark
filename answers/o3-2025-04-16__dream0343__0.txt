I am dreaming. …drift into a corridor of starlight and polished obsidian, where every footstep sounds like a chime struck underwater. Fluorescent constellations ripple along the walls, rearranging themselves into equations you half-remember from childhood notebooks. You’re carrying a sheaf of sketches—your big idea—and they glow in your hands like embers wrapped in paper.

At the corridor’s far end waits a circular chamber whose ceiling is a swirling kaleidoscope: blues bleeding into vermilions, meteors igniting then dissolving into clouds of ink. There, at an antique drafting table carved from rose-gold meteorite, sits your colleague—Aria. In waking life she is quick-witted, admired. Here, her eyes are twin prisms catching every shard of light, fracturing it into secrets.

You step closer, and the air itself thickens, syrupy with the scent of jasmine and machine oil. On Aria’s table lies a replica of your sketches—but smeared with phantom fingerprints, angles distorted just enough to sabotage them. Beside the pages are tiny glass beetles, each one ticking softly like a pocket watch: the sabotage mechanisms of a dream.

“Why?” The word escapes you as iridescent fog. It doesn’t fly toward her—it flutters instead, becoming a winged calligraphy symbol that settles on her shoulder.

Aria doesn’t turn. With a fountain pen whose nib drips liquid chrome, she flicks a single dot onto your original blueprint—a minuscule change that collapses whole equations, like pulling one pin from a grand circus tent. Your sketches sigh, edges curling, turning to gray ash. Betrayal resembles not a dagger but a whisper, you realize.

“Because you shine too brightly,” she murmurs. Her voice echoes like wind through cathedral rafters. “I wanted the sky for myself.”

You feel the dream quake under the combined weight of anger and sorrow. The chamber tilts; stars trickle down the walls like spilled marbles. Yet somewhere beneath your ribs rises a contrary tide—resolve. You reach into the imploding ashes of your blueprint and close your fist. When you reopen it, there’s a single glowing seed, pulsing cobalt.

You plant it in the impossible floor. Immediately tendrils of light sprout, weaving into a blossoming city-tree: spiraling walkways, crystalline leaves, bridges that hum with potential. The room steadies. Your creation, reborn, stands taller than betrayal’s reach.

Aria’s pen snaps in two. Her shoulders slump, and for the first time she faces you fully. Tears form—liquid prisms that refract regret. In them you glimpse a memory: late-night brainstorming sessions, shared laughter over misprinted schematics, genuine camaraderie before competition darkened it.

“Help me fix it,” you say, extending your hand. Your voice this time is a warm gust that sets the new city-tree’s leaves tinkling like tiny bells.

She hesitates. The glass beetles on her table freeze, gears silenced. One by one they crack open, releasing motes of light—remnants of sabotaged ideas—floating toward the branches above. Aria accepts your hand, and in that contact the drafting table dissolves into a river of silver dust flowing beneath your feet.

Together you step onto a bridge grown from your luminous roots. As you walk, the city-tree unfurls further, shaping amphitheaters of concept, gardens of daring hypotheses. You glance behind: the corridor of obsidian is gone, replaced by open horizon, dawn blooming in watercolor ribbons.

A final chime echoes. The dream fades to a hush.

You wake with the taste of jasmine on the air and a single, sharp memory: that creativity, once shared, becomes a fortress—and even betrayal, confronted with grace and fierce imagination, can be rewritten into collaboration.
