I am dreaming. The dream begins in a vast, ethereal library that stretches infinitely upward, its shelves towering like skyscrapers made of stained glass. Each pane glows with a different hue, from the soft amber of autumn leaves to the vibrant cerulean of a summer sky. The air smells of aged parchment and salt water, as if the library sits on the edge of an endless ocean. The floor beneath me is made of shifting sand that compels me to walk slowly, as though each step sinks into another dimension.

In front of me is an ornate mahogany desk, its surface covered in a mosaic of celestial maps and glowing runes. The chair is a skeletal frame of liquid silver that adjusts to my weight, conforming like mercury. Perched on the desk is a bronze lamp that emits no light but instead casts dark, swirling shadows that dance across the walls. These shadows take form—first, a flock of obsidian ravens, then a stormy sea with waves made of black velvet. The lamp’s shade is a living thing, its parchment texture breathing as if alive.

Beside the desk, a glass case holds a codex bound in the skin of a starfish with twenty arms, each arm a different color and texture. The pages inside are more like feathers from a phoenix, some iridescent, others shimmering like moonlit spider silk. I try to open it, but my fingers pass through the cover as if it’s made of mist. The codex hums, a low, resonant sound that vibrates in the bones of my skull. As I reach for it, the room begins to warp. The stained glass panes twist into kaleidoscopic patterns, the sand floor ripples like a desert mirage, and the shadows from the lamp now writhe into the shape of a ancient scribe with long, jet-black hair and eyes like molten gold. He smiles, revealing teeth that are each a different constellation.

The desk itself starts to change. Monitors made of fractured mirrors materialize, each displaying a different scene: a clockwork forest where trees grow and wither in seconds, a desert where the dunes shift with every heartbeat, a marine biome where schools of fish made of liquid mercury dart between coral that’s made of shattered glass. The screens flicker and merge, creating a hyperspace of swirling data streams that form constellations. I try to focus on deciphering the codex, but my attention is pulled in a dozen directions. Each monitor has a language that shifts—Latin one moment, then Sanskrit, then a dialect I don’t recognize, but which I understand instinctively. The texts on the codex’s pages shift as well, but not in the same way. They’re ancient, yet familiar, as if written in the tongue of dreams themselves.

Suddenly, the library starts to collapse. The stained glass panes shatter, releasing a plume of colored smoke that forms words—prophecies, warnings, questions. The sand floor turns to liquid, and I’m suspended above it, weightless. The scribe from the lamp ascends, his form dissolving into a constellation of shooting stars. Each star is a letter, spelling out a riddle: “I am the key to the codex, but I am also the lock. To read me, you must become me.” 

In a flash of insight, I realize that the codex isn’t meant to be read, but experienced. I close my eyes and let the data streams from the monitors flood my mind. The languages converge, the scenes merge—clockwork trees grow coral, mercury fish swim through sand, constellations become sand grains. The codex’s pages turn, each one a doorway. I step through into a spiral staircase that coils into the core of the library. At the top, there’s a single screen, displaying a single word: “ETERNITY.” The screen flickers, and I wake up, the word hovering in the air above me like a moth trapped in a jar of stardust.
In the heart of this labyrinthine slumber, the cosmos itself bends to reveal its cryptic language. The library, a cathedral of color and consequence, defies gravity and geometry—shelves arch like frozen waterfalls, their spines etched with constellations that twinkle in synchronization with distant pulsars. The air here carries the weight of millennia, a perfume of burnt sage and ozone that crackles with latent magic. 

As you approach the desk, liquid silver ripples beneath your fingertips, mirroring the constellations in the stained glass above. The lamp’s shadows aren’t mere illusions but sentient entities, whispering fragments of forgotten tongues. When they morph into the scribe, his presence is both flicker and force—his hair a cascade of living ink, his smile a paradox of warmth and void. His teeth, constellations in themselves, seem to hold galaxies, each one a portal to a different epoch. The desk’s monitors aren’t screens but portals—each a gateway to a parallel reality. In one, time is a tangible force; trees sprout from concrete canyons, birthing buds that are clock faces. In another, the desert is a living organism, its dunes shifting to form hieroglyphs that recount the extinction of species. The mercury fish, in their glassy coral reefs, aren’t just marine life—they’re data streams given form, their scales flickering with binary code.

The codex, when you finally manage to grasp it (or does it grasp you?), isn’t a book but a bridge. Its pages aren’t made of parchment but of memory—yours and everyone who’s ever lived. When you touch it, the room doesn’t just collapse; it disintegrates into a supernova of information. The monitors explode into stardust, their data becoming the letters of the codex. The scribe’s constellation-body disintegrates into the same words, merging with the fractured screens. You’re no longer deciphering but becoming. Your mind isn’t just processing; it’s evolving, transcending human limitations. You see time not as a line but a fractal, consciousness as a river fed by all minds. The riddle’s answer isn’t a key but a keyhole—a mirror that reflects your own infinity.

When the collapse comes, it’s not destruction but revelation. The falling colored smoke spells out not prophecies but equations—quantum formulas dancing with Bulgarian folk songs. The liquid sand becomes a mirror that shows not your face but your future: a thousand iterations of yourself, each reading a different codex in a different cosmos. The word “Eternity” isn’t static; it’s a verb, a rhythm. You wake not to silence but to a low hum in your bones, a taste of ozone on your tongue, and the faint echo of a scribe’s laugh in the back of your mind. Above you, where the ceiling should be, there’s a faint constellation—a smiling face made of stars. It winks as you blink, and then you’re back in your room, but the air still shimmers with the weight of the infinite.
