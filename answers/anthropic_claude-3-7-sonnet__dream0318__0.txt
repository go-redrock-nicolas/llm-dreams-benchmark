I am dreaming. I find myself wandering through a labyrinth of memories that aren't mine, yet feel intimately familiar. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of impossible colors—hues that shift between deep indigo and burnished copper, colors that have no names in waking life. As I walk, the path beneath my feet transforms with each step—sometimes cobblestone streets glistening with recent rain, other times soft forest moss that seems to breathe with my footfalls.

In this dreamscape, I encounter doors standing freely in open spaces. Each time I open one, I step into a different life I've invented—here I'm a celebrated explorer who discovered an ancient underwater civilization; there I'm a reclusive composer whose music can alter the weather. With each doorway crossed, the fabrications grow more intricate, more convincing. I begin to forget which memories were ever true.

The people I meet have faces that shift subtly, becoming someone new even as I speak with them. They listen eagerly to my tales, their eyes reflecting back the elaborate worlds I spin, until I can see my own inventions taking form in the air between us like shimmering tapestries.

Eventually, I come upon a circular room lined entirely with mirrors, each reflecting a different version of myself—each one living out a story I've told. They move independently, living lives I've only claimed to have lived. With dawning unease, I realize I can no longer remember which reflection was originally mine.

As dream logic shifts, I'm suddenly standing before a vast library where every book contains a different lie I've told. Some are slender volumes, others massive tomes. When I open them, the words rise from the pages like smoke, forming scenes that envelop me completely before dissolving away.

The question emerges from the very fabric of the dream: Who am I beneath all these stories?
