I am dreaming. I find myself in a grand, cavernous hall carved from obsidian and illuminated by flickering torches that cast long, dancing shadows across the walls. The air is thick with an electric tension, a silent storm brewing beneath the surface of every word spoken. I stand at the head of a colossal, circular table, its surface etched with ancient runes that pulse faintly with a crimson glow, as if imbued with secrets of their own. Around me sit diplomats and emissaries from realms both fantastical and foreboding, each cloaked in ornate robes or armor shimmering with unfamiliar heraldry. Their faces are half-hidden by intricate masks—some of ivory, others of blackened iron—revealing only glinting eyes that dart with suspicion and cunning.

I am the arbiter of this delicate negotiation, tasked with forging peace between factions whose hatred spans centuries. There are the Skyborne, a race of winged warriors with alabaster feathers trailing from their shoulders, their voices carrying the sharp, cutting edge of wind. Opposite them sit the Deepkin, beings of the abyss with scales that shimmer like oil slicks, their whispers bubbling like underwater currents. Between them are the Emberwrought, smiths of molten rock whose every gesture sparks embers, and the Veilweavers, ethereal figures cloaked in mist, their intentions as intangible as their forms. Each faction claims to seek harmony, yet I can feel the undercurrent of deception rippling through the room like a serpent coiling beneath still waters.

As the talks begin, I notice the subtle tells—the Skyborne ambassador’s feathers twitching imperceptibly when trade routes are mentioned, the Deepkin’s webbed fingers tightening around a hidden object beneath the table, the Emberwrought’s molten gaze flaring brighter at the mention of territorial boundaries. The Veilweavers, meanwhile, seem to flicker in and out of existence, their murmured agreements laced with double meanings that hang in the air like riddles. I sense that each word spoken is a carefully crafted facade, a veneer over motives as dark and tangled as the roots of an ancient tree.

The layers of deceit begin to peel back like the skin of an overripe fruit. I catch a fleeting glimpse of a Skyborne diplomat slipping a parchment to an Emberwrought ally under the guise of a handshake—its edges gleam with a poisonous green hue. Simultaneously, a Deepkin emissary’s murmured chant sends a shiver down my spine, and I swear I see the shadows in the room deepen, as if summoned to spy on their rivals. The Veilweavers, ever elusive, weave threads of mist that linger around my ears, whispering half-truths about betrayals yet to come. My own voice, steady and commanding, feels like a fragile dam holding back a flood of chaos. I question each statement, probe each promise, but the deeper I dig, the murkier the waters become.

Suddenly, the obsidian walls of the hall tremble, and the runes on the table flare violently, casting a blood-red light across the assembly. A deafening crack splits the air, and the floor beneath us fractures, revealing a yawning chasm from which sickly green vapors rise. From this abyss, I hear a cacophony of voices—ancient, enraged, and hungry—whispering accusations of treachery that echo through the chamber. The factions leap to their feet, masks slipping to reveal expressions of raw fear and fury. Weapons are drawn, alliances crumble in an instant, and I realize with a jolt that the true agenda of this meeting was never peace—it was to unleash something far older and more malevolent than any of us could fathom.

My heart races as I stand at the edge of the abyss, the heat of betrayal and the chill of dread warring within me. The torchlight flickers wildly now, and in the chaos, I see reflections of my own face in the shattered obsidian—each one distorted, each one hiding a secret I didn’t know I kept. The ground quakes again, and as the factions charge at one another with primal roars, I feel the weight of my role as arbiter shift into something heavier, something inescapable. I am no longer just a mediator—I am the key to whatever lies below, and the voices from the chasm call my name with chilling familiarity.

Just as a clawed hand—neither Skyborne, Deepkin, nor any other—emerges from the abyss, reaching for me with a promise of revelation or ruin, my vision blurs. The hall, the factions, the chasm—all dissolve into a kaleidoscope of fractured light and echoing screams. I am falling, or perhaps flying, through a void where the boundaries of dream and reality twist like smoke… until I jolt awake, my breath ragged, my mind still tangled in the web of deceit I presided over in that otherworldly court.
