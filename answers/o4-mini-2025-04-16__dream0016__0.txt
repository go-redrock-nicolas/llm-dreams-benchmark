I am dreaming. You’re drifting in that half-awakened space between sleep and panic. The airport around you stretches impossibly, ceiling arches rising like rippled waves of glass, each pane reflecting a thousand fragmented versions of yourself. Your heart hammers as you clutch your boarding pass—an ornate scroll inked in swirling runes you can’t decipher.

As the departure board flickers “DELAYED” in blood-red letters, the fluorescent lights above flicker and hum, pulse with an otherworldly resonance. Each time the word “DELAYED” reappears, it thuds in your chest like a funeral drum. You look down and find your shoes growing roots, burrowing into the cold tile floor. You tug at them, but the roots tighten, as if the airport itself wants to hold you here.

Around you, strangers dissolve into strange creatures. A businesswoman’s briefcase sprouts wings and flutters away; a somber man’s tie stretches into a snake that coils around your ankles, whispering his behind-the-eyes anxieties into your ear. You try to stand, but you’re weighed down by the gravity of missed connections.

Time warps: you glimpse a digital clock on the wall, its numbers melting like candles in a hot breeze—11:57, 11:60, 12:03, then back again. Your phone, in your trembling hand, freezes on a screen showing the conference venue’s stage, bright with promise, but the spotlight flickers, then goes out. You sense every minute lost is a secret siphon draining your purpose.

A phantom porter approaches, trolley rattling with unbreakable glass suitcases. He tilts his head, eyes hollow as moonlit wells. In a dry whisper he offers you a steaming cup of coffee—the aroma is overwhelmingly sweet, like cotton candy mixed with gunpowder. You sip, and your thoughts scatter like startled birds.

Suddenly the corridor stretches and bows. Walls breathe—one side yawns like a cavernous maw, the other pulses in and out, dimming to inky black. You step forward, heart galloping, until the lights give way to a shimmering tunnel of floating confetti: pages torn from your flight itinerary, conference agendas, scribbled margins where you’d written “Don’t be late.” They spin in an updraft that lifts you a few inches off the ground.

Just as you begin to panic—suspended, weightless—a voice booms from the end of the tunnel: “Boarding now, to Gate Epsilon-Nine.” The confetti swirls faster, coalesces into a glowing doorway. You feel your anxiety tighten into a single bead of molten metal in your chest. You step forward, whole world trembling around you, and—

You emerge on the tarmac. The airplane before you is surreal: its fuselage ripples like water under moonlight, engines silent but humming with unseen power. A flight attendant, her uniform spun from starlight, beckons you aboard with a gentle smile.   
  
You cross the threshold. Behind you, the airport labyrinth collapses into silence, and ahead, the portal closes with a soft click—just as the final minute ticks away.
