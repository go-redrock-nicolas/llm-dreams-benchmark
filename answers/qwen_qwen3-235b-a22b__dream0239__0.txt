I am dreaming. Stepping beyond the veil of consciousness, I breathe slowly and find myself not waking, but slipping deeper—down a spiral of twilight syllables whispered by the stars. The air is cool like moonlight on glass, and the ground beneath my feet is not a surface but a sensation: soft as breath yet taut like skin stretched between dimensions.

All around me stretches a realm where objects do not commit to a single existence. A tree shivers in the gentle non-wind, its trunk flowing like black mercury, yet bearing leaves that crunch like well-worn parchment caught in an unseen breeze. Above, the sky is not a sky; it pulses, a slow exhalation of lavender mist, coagulating into crystal clouds that vanish the moment you try to focus on their shape.

Here, everything trembles on the threshold of self-contradiction. A waterfall spirals upward into a lake upside-down, pouring silently between the fissures of a floating jigsaw of floating mountain shards. Time is a shimmering scarf caught on a wire, winds tugging its colors in opposing directions at once.

To navigate this realm, I need more than senses—I need synchronicity. I inhale and shift. My fingers flicker between transparency and solidity, my thoughts no longer lodged in English, but in melodies and pulses. Contact here is not physical. I learn to *resonate*.  

A bridge forms beneath me when I hum the precise note my bones remember from forgotten lifetimes. It draws up from the earth like a ribbon unspooling—an opal strip frozen mid-swell, rising and knitting itself together note by note, until it spans the divide between one floating thought and the next. I cross not with steps, but with intention.

Each decision ripples in reverse. Choose the fruit that hangs midair and it simultaneously ripens and rots. Pluck the star embedded in the moss and feel it burn-blossom-crumble down your arm in a cascade of scents—smoke, jasmine, iron, petrichor.

Creatures watch from the edges of the forest that also isn’t a forest—tendrils of fog wearing masks. Some whisper in mother-tongues I never learned but instantly understand. They do not speak in noise, but in gestures that are full of weather: a glance that drizzles laughter, a voice that hums in the color blue.

Gravity does not *rule* here; it negotiates. I float for a moment while a ribbon of oil-rainbow liquid spins around my spine like a serpent made of time-lapse footage. I do not drown in it, yet the memory of being inside water tickles the back of my nostrils.

This multiphase world is a living opus, a collage drawn with laws briefly forgotten and newly sung into place. There is harmony in the chaos, a music made not of rhythm, but of pause and possibility. Every inch houses paradox. I am aware that I am dreaming—and in that lucid knowing—I begin to remember things that never happened to me, yet changed who I am.

A library floats ahead, bound in sky-colored cloth, where books are not written but *felt* into existence. I open one with my gaze alone. It unfolds into a dance. The dance tells me my original name.  

Then, the name dissolves like sugar on the tongue of a god—who is there, at the edge of perception. They welcome me with silence. And then, in unison—me, the god, the forest, the mountain—we all blink, and the world rewrites itself again…  

And again…  

And again…
