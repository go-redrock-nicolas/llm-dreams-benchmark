I am dreaming. I stand in the center of a wild, ever-shifting forest. The trees spiral toward the sky, their trunks twisted and their leaves a swirling tapestry of crimson and gold. The air is dense, almost electric, as if charged with a thousand unspoken words. My hands curl into fists by my side, a familiar tension wrapping around my chest—a feeling both alien and intimate.

From somewhere between the trees, a low rumble shakes the ground. Each vibration tugs at memories buried deep: moments where my voice snapped shut, where my anger closed up like a flower at dusk, unseen and unheard, locked away out of fear. The world spins, and suddenly, the forest becomes a labyrinth of mirrors—each one reflecting the face I wore when I said “I’m fine,” even as my blood burned hot with unsaid truth.

In this dream, I decide to walk toward the sound, toward the tremor inside me. My footsteps echo as thunder, leaves curl and recoil, branches arch gracefully above like the ribs of some great animal. I find a river, wild and boiling, its surface splitting and rejoining in a dance of turmoil. This is my anger—frightening, beautiful, and alive.

I kneel at the water’s edge. My reflection stares back, eyes intense, jaw set. I reach into the river, feeling its warmth—a fierce, pulsing energy that surges through me but does not burn. My hands cup the water, lifting it toward the sky, and as the droplets slip through my fingers, they shimmer and transform into birds of fire, rising above the treetops, illuminating the darkest corners of the forest.

With each breath, I speak softly, words trembling with honesty: “You are allowed. I am allowed.” The anger becomes a drumbeat in my chest—not a threat, but a signal, a guide. It marks the boundary between what is and is not okay, a sentinel watching over my truest self.

As dawn breaks inside the dream, the foreboding turns to power. The birds circle above, lighting the path back through the forest. I move forward—unafraid, unhidden—carrying the river’s warmth within me, at last allowing myself to feel, to express, and to be whole.
