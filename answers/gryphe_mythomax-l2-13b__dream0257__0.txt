I am dreaming. suddenly realize that you have the incredible power to absorb the emotional energy around you. You don't know where this ability comes from or how you managed to harness it, but it's there now. With the rise of anger from both yourself and the other person, you focus on the swirling colors of emotion radiating from them, and let it wash over you.

Instead of feeling frustrated or enraged, a soothing warmth spreads through your body as you take in the negativity being thrown at you. The anger dissipates, leaving only a lingering peace that surrounds you both. Surprised by your newfound power, you slowly open your eyes to a tranquil landscape.

In front of you is a crystal-clear lake, its surface reflecting the vibrant rainbow of colors from the surrounding foliage. A gentle breeze rustles through tall grasses and tree limbs, creating a symphony of calming whispers. Birds chirp happily in the distance, adding to the serene ambiance.

You stand up and stretch, reveling in the sense of calm that permeates the air. As you step closer to the water's edge, you notice ripples forming in the otherwise still surface. Curious, you dip your fingers into the lake, and something extraordinary happens.

The water responds to your touch, morphing into a misty swirl of colors that dance around your fingers like tiny insects. Drawing yourself up to your full height, you reach out and spread your arms wide, embracing the vibrant display of light and energy. 

With a joyful cry, you step fully into the water, becoming one with the mesmerizing spectacle. The colors swirl around you, enveloping you in a cocoon of radiant energy that thrums with life. And in that moment, you realize that this is not just a dream but a glimpse into a world beyond anything you could have ever imagined. You are awake, alive and filled with boundless possibility. Welcome to your new reality.
