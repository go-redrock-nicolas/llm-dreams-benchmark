I am dreaming. The air shimmers with an electric blue hue, the kind you see just before a lightning storm, except here it’s perpetual. I’m floating—not in the serene way one might float in water, but like a leaf caught in an updraft, tumbling gently through a sky stitched with silver threads. Below me, the landscape is something out of a fable. Towering trees with bark like liquid mercury stretch into the heavens, their branches thicker than my city’s skyscrapers. Between them, rivers of liquid light twist and turn, their currents humming a melody that vibrates in my molars.

A voice, honeyed and ancient, interrupts the serenity. "Choose, wanderer. The path of the hawk or the path of the hare." I turn toward the sound. A creature stands in a clearing below, its form shifting between fox and woman, feathers and fur. Its eyes are twin galaxies, swirling with possibility. 

Behind me, a door materializes—a door made entirely of glass, but inside its panes are scenes from my life: my first kiss, a failed exam, a loved one’s laugh. Each memory flickers like a candle in a breeze. If I pass through, the door will take me home. Safe. Unchanged. Predictable.

In front of me, a staircase spirals down to a forest floor littered with crystalline flowers. Approaching them releases a scent reminiscent of cinnamon and regret. Ahead, the trees part, revealing a marketplace where merchants sell hours of time in pouches, buyers barter whispers for wisdom, and a lone musician plays a flute carved from a bone, each note causing blossoms to wilt or bloom at its whim. Here, every choice has a price written in starlight. 

The celestial being before me speaks again. "The hawk soars but casts no shadow. The hare is grounded but remembers every root. Your choice defines the world you wake to." 

I reach for the door and then pause. The music from the bone flute tugs at my heart. If I descend, I might lose the ones I love, or myself, or both. But the memories in the door—they’re curated, pristine, artificial. Is safety a cage? 

The fox-woman’s grin widens, galaxies spinning faster. "Time bends, but does not wait." 

I let go of the door’s handle and plummet, wind stinging my eyes, as the forest’s melody swells—a decision neither pure principle nor mere pragmatism, but something wilder, born of the storm and the stillness within.
