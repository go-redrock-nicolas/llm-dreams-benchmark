I am dreaming. I see myself standing at the center of an enormous, spiraling library that seems to stretch endlessly in every direction. The shelves tower above me, endless columns of books bound in emerald leather, each with no titles. As I start to wander down one aisle, a woman wearing a crimson robe appears, her eyes glowing faintly with an otherworldly light. She introduces herself as the Matron of the Order of the Silent Flame, and declares me the new guardian of the library, despite my confusion and protests. She explains the library is a nexus between worlds, each book holding a soul. But disturbing a book before its time erases that soul from existence. Then a catastrophic event occurs—a shelf collapses, books spill, and one hovers, glowing ominously. I instinctively reach out and grab it… The Matron’s gaze turns grave. What do I see next?
