I am dreaming. Suddenly, I'm in a grand library, the air thick with the scent of old parchment. The walls are lined with books that shimmer faintly, their spines etched with symbols I can't decipher. A figure steps forward—a tall, androgynous being with iridescent skin and antlers like cracked crystal. Their voice resonates like wind through autumn leaves.  

"Ah," they say, "the seeker of truths. You've come at a disadvantag—"

I interrupt: "Wait. I didn't choose this. You've pulled me here!"

They smile, revealing teeth like polished bone. "Some lessons can't wait for schedules." The being gestures, and a book floats from the shelf, hovering before us. The pages flip on their own, each revealing fragmented visions: 

**First Vision:** A bustling marketplace in a city of glass and copper. Figures with wings barter in strange currencies. A child's laughter echoes.  

**Second Vision:** The same marketplace, but now in ruin. The wings are weapons, the currencies bloodied. The laughter is a distant, fading echo.  

**Third Vision:** The marketplace reconstructed, but the architecture feels *off*, as if stitched together from mismatched pieces. The wings are now ornamental, glued to the creatures' backs. The laughter? Mechanized, synthetic.  

The being leans closer. "You've always argued that progress must be linear—damage followed by perfect reconstruction. But these visions? They show what happens when a civilization heals... differently."  

My mind races. I'd been so certain linear progress was the only path. Suddenly, the ground quakes. Shadows twist into shapes mimicking my past speeches, each word spoken now a contorted shadow creature. They hiss my arguments back at me: *"Stagnation is inevitable without order! Chaos is destructive! Tradition must dictate!"*  

I stumble back, the comfort of my old convictions unraveling. The being holds out a hand. "See the cost of your rigidness?"  

***Response:*** I take your hand, voice trembling. "What... what do I do now?" The floor falls away, and I'm left standing in a void with only scattered shards of light, each a different branching timeline.  

**Narrator's Note:** This marks the turning point. The dreamer is now ready to embrace nuance. The real work begins.

The dream ends here. What would YOUR response be when *confronted with information that proved you were wrong about something you've strongly advocated for*?
