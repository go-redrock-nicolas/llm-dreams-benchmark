I am dreaming. You are alone on a crowded subway. The train screeches to a standstill between stations, and the lights flicker before plunging everything into pitch darkness. The air constricts, heavy with the weight of uncertainty. Whispers echo faintly, and feet shuffle nervously in the void. You feel a ripple of panic spread like fire through the car, but as you reach for the person beside you, the lights return. But it's not the world you know. Each passenger has transformed into a hybrid creature, blending human and animal traits. A man's face is half human, half wolf, another's skin shimmers like eel scales, and a woman's eyes glow bright amber. Their gazes lock with yours, and just as they move to touch you, the train jolts again. This time, when the lights blink out, you realize you are no longer confined to the subway.

Instead, you stand on a vast, barren plain under a starless sky. The wind howls in an unearthly chorus, carrying with it the scent of rain and something elseâ€”something ancient and primal. Bolts of lightning rip the darkness, painting strange figures on the ground around you. They are not human, not entirely. Some have the bodies of horses with wings like bats, others the heads of lions crowned with antlers. They stalk closer, their eyes fixed on you. A low, thunderous growl vibrates through the earth, and one of them speaks, its voice like thunder and smoke.

"You are not of this place," it rumbles. "Why have you come here?"

Before you can answer, the ground beneath you begins to tremble, shaking you awake. The world dissolves into the soft comfort of your own bed. But for a moment, the dream had felt more real than waking life.

What would you do if you faced the creatures again?
