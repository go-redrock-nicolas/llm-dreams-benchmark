I am dreaming. I find myself in a soaring ivory library, its walls curving up into a twilight sky dappled with constellations I can almost decipher. The shelves around me are lined with books whose titles shift as I look at them—each one a record of the expectations, ambitions, and self-imposed rules I’ve accumulated over the years. I notice that many of these volumes are heavy, their covers weighted with gold leaf and iron clasps, while others seem untouched—slim paperbacks gathering dust in a neglected alcove.

Wandering through these aisles, I feel a pressure in my chest, as if I am carrying a satchel filled with stones. Each stone is inscribed with a word: "Perfection," "Productivity," "Approval," "Flawlessness." I realize I have spent much of my life trying to live up to these ever-increasing standards, never glancing at the softer volumes—those labeled "Rest," "Mistake," "Enough."

At the center of the library, a great domed skylight reveals the moonlit sky. I notice a winding staircase carved from silvery birchwood, inviting me upwards. As I ascend, the satchel-lightens. Halfway up, I pause, pulling out the stone labeled "Perfection." With a deep breath, I drop it over the railing. It lands with a gentle thud, shattering into wildflowers that grow instantly around its fragments.

On the next landing, I find a journal titled "Compassion." Its pages are empty, inviting me to fill them with kinder words, gentler thoughts. I write: *It is enough to be present. It is enough to be learning. I am a garden, not a machine.*

With each step, I let go of another stone. They become saplings, pools of light, lanterns to guide me upward. The impossibly high standards dissolve into a golden mist, warming my heart. I see now that I am not meant to be flawless marble, but ever-growing earth—alive and enough as I am.

In this dream, as I step onto the top floor, I open a window to the starlit night and inhale deeply. I am lighter, softer, transformed by the gentle grace I have found for myself. The dream reminds me: to be human is to grow, to err, and to still be worthy of love—especially my own.
