I am dreaming.

The world shimmers into focus—bright, primal, strange. I am standing at the edge of a dense, ancient forest that sprawls beyond sight, a green and shadowed cathedral of mossy trunks and golden slanting light. The air hums with the music of unseen insects and somewhere, a brook chatters impatiently over stones. Around me, five strangers wait, faces swirling and half-familiar in that way only dream companions can be: a tall woman with the eyes of a falcon, a wiry boy clutching a battered journal, a bearded man with hands like sculpted oak, an old woman with silver hair wound into a crown, and a girl whose laughter glimmers with far-off bells.

Despite the damp pulse of anxiety in my chest, every fiber of my being hums with the sweet charge of purpose. In my waking world, I’ve never once led, never hefted a compass, never plotted a route. But here, in dream, I move forward, voice confident and alive, as if the knowledge is sprouting fully formed in my mind—a map etched along neural pathways made for this very moment.

We press into the wild. Thorns snag at our clothes, but I find the narrow path—winding through beds of bluebells, over roots slick as bones, beneath columns of sunlight honeyed and thick. My companions trust me implicitly, falling in step as we cross log bridges over misty ravines and scale cliffs veined with forgotten fossils. When the sky breaks into violet and silver, dropping a curtain of fine, cold rain, I lead us to a cave veiled with crystal droplets. Laughter crackles inside while we share mythic stories around a fire kindled by my own hands—a skill unknown to me just hours before yet summoned now with impossible ease.

A wolf’s howl echoes in the distance, and the girl leans into me, eyes wide. “Will we be safe?” she asks, her voice trembling like the wind.

I nod, feeling the certainty of the stars above press into my bones. “Yes,” I say, and I believe it—because this world has given me secret wisdom, a binding to all the wild things that live and run beneath pale, dreaming moons.

When morning comes, we push deeper, finding ancient stones carved with runes, waterfalls that sing in voices half-human, half-river, and a clearing where butterflies the size of sparrows spiral in dizzy, jeweled clouds. My fear becomes exhilaration; my hesitation transforms into courage.

At the journey's end, we emerge on a hidden summit, the valley stretching out beneath us, shimmering in blue mist and possibility. The strangers clasp my shoulders in gratitude, their faces lit by dawn and something like hope. And, as I stand above the world, heart thrumming with wonder, I realize—anything is possible in the dreaming wild.
