I am dreaming. I'm floating through a colossal library where the ceiling breathes and the floor flows like mercury. Books aren't merely shelved—they orbit around crystalline columns that pulse with amber light. I reach for a weathered tome, and as my fingers brush its spine, I feel an emotion surging through me that has no name—it's the bittersweet revelation of remembering something I never actually experienced, coupled with the vertigo of recognizing a pattern that connects everything I've ever known.

I try to explain this feeling to the librarian, whose face shifts between human features and geometric constellations. My words emerge as ribbons of iridescent color that twist and fold in midair, never quite forming the shape I need. The librarian nods knowingly, reaching into their chest and pulling out a small music box that plays a melody so familiar it aches, yet I'm certain I've never heard it before.

The floor beneath me suddenly becomes transparent, revealing endless layers of dreaming figures—all me, all dreaming different dreams that somehow contain this one. I understand with startling clarity that this emotion I cannot name is the feeling of being simultaneously the dream and the dreamer, the story and the reader, the question and its answer.

The walls of the library dissolve into fields of luminous poppies that whisper equations. I realize I've always known this place—it exists in the space between heartbeats, in the moment before remembering something important, in the silence after profound words.

The unnamed feeling blossoms in my chest like a geometric flower unfolding in impossible dimensions, both ancient and newborn, suffocating and liberating, mine and universal all at once.
