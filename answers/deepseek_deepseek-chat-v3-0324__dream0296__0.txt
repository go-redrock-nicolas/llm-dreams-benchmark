I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds...**  

You stand before a towering mirror with a frame of twisting vines and forgotten constellations, its surface swirling like liquid mercury. The reflection staring back is *almost* you—but not quite. The eyes are deeper, shimmering with galaxies not of this world. Your hair shifts like smoke, darker in some places, threaded with strands of silver light in others. When you raise a hand to touch your face, the reflection hesitates, then slowly mirrors you—but its fingertips graze the glass, sending ripples across the surface like a pond disturbed by some unseen presence beneath.  

A whisper curls from the mirror—your voice, but layered with echoes of people you’ve never met, places you’ve never been. *"Do you know me yet?"* Your chest tightens. You lean closer, and the reflection *leans out*, its breath fogging the glass between you. The scent of cold iron and violets fills the air.  

Then—movement. Behind the reflection, shadows coil and twist, forming archways into impossible rooms, cities suspended in midair, an ocean frozen midwave. Your reflection smiles—too wide, too knowing—and extends a hand *through* the mirror. The moment your fingers meet, the glass shatters like ice, and you’re falling—  

Not down, but *sideways*, through a kaleidoscope of half-remembered memories and futures that never were. And just before you wake, the voice lingers:  
*"You’ll remember next time."*
