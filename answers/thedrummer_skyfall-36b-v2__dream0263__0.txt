I am dreaming. The dream begins as a cacophony of alarms blaring from every direction. You're standing in the middle of a vast, neon-lit office that seems to stretch infinitely in all directions, a sprawling labyrinth of cubicles and conference rooms. Each space is a different project, each with its own frantic team of people yelling for your attention.

In one corner, a group is furiously knocking on walls, assembled a call center to coordinate supply chains for an upcoming product launch that's gone off the rails. The banging of hammers and shouted demands echo through the room and make you wince, your main supplier is inexplicably unavailable, and every team member's eyes are wild, pleading for a solution.

As you try to process their words, your vision blurs. You feel like you're suffocating, the dense air thick with acrid smoke. On closer inspection, it's the smoke of burnout, the tangible evidence of your own exhaustion and all-consuming pressure. Every time you take a step forward the smoke grows thicker, choking you, making it harder to focus. Panic hits you like a punch to the gut.

Your assistant suddenly materializes before you, Edward Scissorhands, his razor-sharp fingers pointing at his watch. His timer has gone off - you're already ten minutes late for another meeting. He starts running down the hallway, gesturing wildly for you to follow. As you chase after him, you see the meeting room for the project, your biggest client's event has been postponed at the last minute.

Edward bursts through the door - and it hits you like reality - he's not, he's just an intern with a clipboard, already six minutes into the meeting. The client is irate, waving their arms, their face red with anger. They've been double-booked, the deadlines have shifted, and now they're demanding refunds. You try to explain, but your words jumble and fall out of your mouth backwards.

Things start to fracture and bend. Business associates are speaking quickly in garbled nonsense language. Hallways wind around on themselves like perpetual motion machines. Hands pokes through ceilings. Numbers turn into eyes. Reality warps and twists into an impossible architecture.

As panic builds, you try to scream, but when you open your mouth, only static comes out. The world seems to slowdown as your own body becomes heavy, white noise fills your head.

Then you're back in the centre of the office, with its pulsing red and green lights. Deadlines converge and milliseconds swirl around you - each one feels crucial. There are no colours, no shapes, just the endless demand.

You wander further into the office into an endless expanse. The noise of the office fades, replaced by the sound of the air conditioner, the distant buzz of fluorescent lights. It's all sound.

But soon you realize - the lights aren't fluorescent lights - they're the lights on the dashboard of your crashing car from when you were 18, the screaming of a crowd, the roar of an audience.

You start to panic - what's real? What's not? Nothing seems to make sense as you try to hold it together...

But then you feel a tug - your awareness guides you back, back up - and suddenly you're awake, your heart pounding.
