I am dreaming. …I am dreaming.

The echoes of collapsing stone ricochet through the cramped cavern, each rumble a distant thunderclap threatening to shake my very soul loose from its moorings. The frail beam from my flashlight sputters and gasps, painting jagged shadows that slither across the walls. Then, with a final gasp, the bulb flickers out—a dying firefly in a bottomless night.

Total darkness falls. Cold and absolute. Suddenly every ounce of silence throbs with a presence, as if the cave itself has inhaled and is holding its breath. Each heartbeat pounds in my ears, loud as a drum, my fear a living, quivering thing.

For a moment, panic claws at my chest, threatening to burst free. I can almost feel the weight of the earth above, pressing down. But then, as I fumble in the blackness, my hands brush against the wet, rough stone—slick, yet comforting in its solidity. I ground myself in the sensation, letting my other senses bloom in the absence of sight.

The scent of minerals and ancient water slides into my consciousness—sharp, metallic, tinged with something sweet and wild. My palms tingle, every crevice and protrusion on the wall a secret alphabet I try to decipher. With each careful breath, I listen, straining for any hint of breeze, the burble of a hidden stream, the subtle hum of life beneath the surface.

Then, somewhere in the distance—a faint shimmer. It is not light, not in any way I’ve known before, but a gentle luminescence pressing up from the rock itself. Phantom blues and ghostly greens swirl, beckoning me deeper. It feels impossible, like the memory of a dream shaping itself in waking darkness.

Compelled, I follow this otherworldly glow. The cave no longer feels menacing, but holy—a cathedral carved by time itself. Stalactites and stalagmites rise on either side like the organ pipes of some ancient, slumbering god. The floor glistens with veins of quartz that gently pulse beneath my feet, as though the heart of the earth is beating, guiding me onward.

My fear, which ached so sharply only moments ago, falls away. Instead, curiosity surges through my veins, greater than any terror. Each step leads me closer, and now my hands brush something strange—soft, feather-light filaments growing from the stone. Bioluminescent moss. When I caress it, it responds with a silent bloom of emerald light—welcome, warmth, hope.

I sink to my knees, bathing my face in its glow. In this hidden underworld, the dark is not my enemy, but a cocoon—wrapping me in a promise. Somewhere, there is a path forward, a secret tunnel or a slow trickle of air; all I must do is surrender to the cave’s rhythm, trust in its mysterious embrace, and let this vivid dream carry me onward into unknown wonders.
