I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a glass bridge suspended between twin mountain peaks, their jagged ridges clawing at a sky bruised violet and gold by a dying sun. The bridge is no ordinary structure; its translucent panels ripple like liquid, each step sending tremors of iridescent light cascading into the abyss below, where a river of molten obsidian churns and hisses. The air thrums with the low, resonant hum of unseen machinery, as though the mountains themselves are alive, conspiring. 

A voice, neither human nor machine, reverberates through the atmosphere: *"Cross, and you’ll taste the raw pulse of creation. Hesitate, and the bridge remembers your fear."* My breath fogs the glass beneath my boots. With each heartbeat, the panels shift, dissolving and reforming as if daring me to trust their ephemeral solidity. 

I take a step. The bridge hardens, singing a crystalline note. Another step—its surface fractals into kaleidoscopic patterns, alive with bioluminescent flora that blooms beneath my feet, only to wither and crumble into ash. The wind carries whispers: memories of others who’ve walked here. A laugh here, a scream there, swallowed by the void. 

Halfway across, the bridge *breathes*. The glass turns to mist. I fall—not down, but *through*, into a labyrinth of gears and arteries, copper veins pumping liquid starlight. Clockwork insects skitter over my skin, their tiny mandibles stitching symbols into my arms. A paradox takes shape: the harder I struggle, the clearer the symbols glow—instructions? A warning? 

Then, impact. I land in a forest of fossilized lightning, frozen mid-strike, their jagged branches humming with residual energy. Shadows detach from the ground, forming into wolves with galaxies for eyes. They circle, their growls vibrating in my marrow. One lunges—its teeth sink into my shoulder, but there’s no pain, only a flood of sensations: supernovae, tidal waves, the scream of a dying star. 

"Wake," the wolf’s voice growls with a thousand tongues, "or remain. The choice is the risk." 

I wake just as the first lightning tree shatters—or maybe I don’t. The dream lingers in my muscles, electric and indelible.
