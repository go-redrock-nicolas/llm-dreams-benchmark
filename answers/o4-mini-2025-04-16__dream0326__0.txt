I am dreaming. I drift into a violet-smoke sky, weightless, toes brushing against drifting lantern-islands that glow with rippling letters I cannot quite read. Around me, a crowd of silent figures threads through fields of colossal moonflowers whose petals hum faintly like tuning forks. I know—somewhere deep in my chest—there lies a message so vital that if even one person understood, the world might tilt back toward light.  

I open my mouth to speak, but only shadow–wind escapes, twisting into shapes they cannot decipher. They tilt their heads, puzzled, eyes reflecting my lantern-light words as if they were faint echoes in glass. I try again, but sound dissolves into dust motes that drift upward and vanish behind the yawning petals.  

Their faces blur; some reach out, palm-prints gleaming with sapphire dust, but the message still will not cross. The moonflowers bend, their stamens quivering with impatient melody. Desperate, I scoop handfuls of the glowing pollen and blow it toward the crowd. For a moment, each person swirls in a halo of luminous motes—and I believe I see understanding flicker in their eyes—only to have it snuffed out like a candle in thick fog.  

Facing this communication barrier, you press your palms against the trunk of a colossal dream-tree rising from a pool of quicksilver. Its bark pulses with every heartbeat of the earth, and from its knots pour slender filaments of light—threads of meaning. I pluck one filament and weave it through my fingers until it shimmers with my own voice. Then I tie it into a knot that spells out the single word “Remember,” each letter a spark of memory I long to revive in others.  

The dream-tree trembles; its branches ripple out like a great echo, and suddenly the moonflowers lean in closer, the silent figures pause in their restless drift, and the hush grows profound. In that pregnant stillness, the filament unravels, releasing a cascade of images: childhood laughter, wounded promises, starlight oaths—threads of truth I’ve tucked away for too long.  

The crowd stands frozen, bathed in this incandescent mosaic. Breathless, they blink, and I realize—in that luminous hush—they finally hear. A single tear from someone beside me falls onto the tree’s bark, igniting a new sprout of golden leaves.  

Then the lantern-islands begin to sink, the violet sky dissolves into pale dawn, and I awake—heart pounding, arms thrumming with the echo of that last, fragile word. Remember.
