I am dreaming. …feel every practiced movement evaporate like ink dropped into swirling water.  

The stage beneath your shoes is no longer polished wood but a living mosaic of panes—each one a memory you never meant to display. One tile shows the moment you first picked up your instrument; another reveals the night you almost quit. As the giant proscenium curtain rises, those memories glow, rearranging themselves into a path whose pattern you have never seen before.

The spotlight is not a single beam but a molten moon descending, bathing you in molten silver. Its warmth hums through your bones and stirs an ache somewhere between dread and exhilaration. The audience is uncountable, but they do not sit in velvet rows. They float, constellations of faces blinking like lantern fish in a cosmic aquarium. Their applause is silent and dazzling—fireworks that blossom soundlessly in the dark, leaving only the smell of rain on hot pavement.

You glance at the instrument in your hands, expecting the familiar weight of what you have practiced with for years. Instead, it has become a shimmering branch of crystal circuitry, humming with impossible chords. The strings are strands of dawn-colored light, and merely touching them sends ripples—like rings on a lake—through the air. You realize, with a flare of panic, that you do not know how to play this strange thing.

From the orchestra pit rises a wind of parchment: sheet music that’s blank at first, then inked by invisible quills even as you watch. The notes rearrange themselves every heartbeat, a living puzzle written in calligraphy made of starlings midflight. You exhale, and the symbols shift, responding to the rhythm of your own pulse.

A whisper curls around your ears, a voice that might be your own subconscious or the theater itself: “Improvisation is simply preparation you haven’t met yet.”

You lift the crystalline branch, close your eyes, and let your fingers explore. The first sound is nothing like the music you rehearsed; it is the sound of ice cracking in spring, followed by a hush as snowdrops push through. The second chord is thunder rolling backward, returning to the clouds that birthed it. Each resonance paints the air: jungles tumble into existence on the stage’s wings; paper boats sail across an ocean that forms out of curtains made of mist.

Your fear melts into fierce curiosity. You follow the wandering staff lines as they drift before you, playing whatever they suggest—an arpeggio shaped like a question mark, a glissando that tastes of citrus, a diminuendo so delicate it leaves dew on your eyelashes. The audience of galaxies pulses brighter, their silent applause now a gravity that keeps you from drifting off this living floor of memories.

Midway through this spontaneous symphony, the theater walls dissolve, and you hover above a city-sized clockwork. Each gear is an epoch of your life, each ticking tooth a tiny version of you—child, rebel, apprentice, wanderer—flinging sparks as they turn. You are both conductor and mechanical heart. With every note, you set a different gear in motion, rewriting the tempo of your own timeline. Long-forgotten roads peel open beneath you, forming bridges of light that carry unresolved dreams into the present moment.

At the climax, the crystalline instrument unfurls into wings of glass feathers. Your final chord is a wordless vow: I will follow the music wherever it dares to lead. The sound splits into a thousand shards of iridescent quiet, then reforms into a single, perfect tone—an answer you never knew you asked for.

The molten moonlight retracts, becoming once more an ordinary spotlight; the cosmic audience flickers out, revealing rows of empty seats; the stage floor returns to polished wood. But in your hands remains a single feather of that impossible instrument, still humming faintly, as if promising that all your future performances will begin in the innumerable spaces beyond rehearsal.

You wake, heart racing, sheets tangled, and find that hushed melody still echoing in the room. Somewhere inside, a brand-new score is already writing itself—one you will never rehearse, only live.
