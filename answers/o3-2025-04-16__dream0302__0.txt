I am dreaming. I am dreaming…

I open my eyes inside a hall of floating drafting tables—hundreds of them—each drifting like pale-blue lily pads across a bottomless midnight void. Blueprints flutter in invisible winds, their ink glowing as though freshly poured from the veins of fireflies. Rulers spin lazily, pencils hover, and every square centimeter of air seems laced with the scent of cedar shavings and ozone.

I pad across a bridge of graph paper that unrolls itself beneath my feet. Each step prints a perfect grid line with a soft, satisfying click. At the far end of the bridge stands a monumental hourglass, its glass so clear it might be carved from frozen time itself. The upper bulb is packed with glittering sand, each grain a miniature gear. The sand doesn’t pour; it spirals downward in slow, deliberate helixes, turning the lower gears of some unseen mechanism with a faint metallic purr.

Behind the hourglass, a chorus of voices calls my name—colleagues, managers, faceless silhouettes stitched together from smartphone notifications and half-remembered Zoom screens. Their words echo in tinny speaker-phone timbre: “We’re behind schedule. Cut the rivets. Skip the inspections. Ship it now.” 

In their hands they hold a project—my project—an intricately folded origami cathedral. Its buttresses are as thin as moth wings, its rose windows woven from strands of aurora borealis. They extend it to me, demanding I unfold it, flatten it, press it into something printable, bite-sized, quickly consumable. 

Inside my breast pocket I discover a magnifying loupe. When I lift it to the cathedral, the dream zooms in until I am dwarfed by a single stained-glass petal. I can see micro-fractals swirling in ruby panes, can hear the faint hum of color vibrations. One careless tug and the whole confected cosmos will hemorrhage light—centuries of beauty dissolved into confetti. 

I turn back to the hovering silhouettes. They are impatient, arms crossing and uncrossing like malfunctioning metronomes. A crimson “DEADLINE” ticker bleeds across their foreheads. The hourglass behind me shudders; the sand gears quicken their fall, and sparks flare where teeth mesh too roughly. The air reeks of singed promises.

A choice blooms before me in impossible clarity:

1. Snap my fingers, freeze the hourglass, and settle in to polish each opalescent archway, though it means the chorus will grow loud enough to crack the heavens.  
2. Bend the cathedral into a crude pamphlet, satisfy the chorus, but watch it crumble into colorless ash the moment it’s stamped APPROVED.

I choose neither. Instead, I step into the hourglass itself.

The glass is warm, pliant, like glacial honey. I wade upward through the descending gears; each gear that brushes my shoulders absorbs my pulse and slows. The sand obeys my heartbeat, scattering into constellations rather than falling like a monsoon.  

From this suspended stillness, I call out to the silhouettes. My voice ripples through the void, equal parts thunder and lullaby:

“Quality is not slow; it is deliberate. Speed is not haste; it is harmony with purpose. Meet me halfway—let the mechanism match the masterpiece.”

The drafting tables swivel toward me; rulers lock into laser-straight bridges; pencils swarm into automated calligraphy, scripting timelines that breathe, expand, accommodate. The silhouettes dim, their countdowns morphing into soft green progress bars that pulse, patient as moss growth.

I emerge from the hourglass carrying new sand—liquid silver that behaves like inspiration. I sprinkle it over the origami cathedral. Time and craft alloy in a gentle phosphorescence. The structure unfolds itself at its own chosen pace, every spire rising precisely when its shadow is ready to fall in perfect proportion. What once demanded months now flows in resonant days, not rushed, not retarded—simply in tune.

The chorus, now made human, dons aprons splattered with nebula paint. They bow their heads, not in apology but in recognition, and they join me, each person tending a facet with reverent speed. The dream liquefies into shared craftsmanship, the void filling with music that sounds like graphite skimming paper.

When the cathedral finally settles, fully realized, the void fades to dawn-colored mist. The walls of the dream glow apricot and gold, and the hourglass dissolves into a flock of starlings. Every face—mine, theirs—smiles the kind of smile one wears when both the clock and the quality feel sated.

I wake holding an invisible grain of silver sand between thumb and forefinger, remembering that in the waking world, too, speed and excellence can dance—so long as someone has the courage to climb inside the hourglass and reset the rhythm.
