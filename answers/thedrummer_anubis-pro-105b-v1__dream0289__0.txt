I am dreaming. Gristappear in a hauntingly familiar, yet somehow alien landscape. The ground beneath my feet feels like dry, cracked earth, and the sky above is a depressing shade of gray. What little vegetation surrounds me is withered and dying, mirroring the desolation I feel inside.

In the distance, I see the figure of a young woman walking away from me. She turns in my direction, but her face is obscured by shadows. I very much want to know if this mysterious woman holds some answers, and decide to follow her.

As I walk, the earth shifts beneath me, and old memories start to surface. I see my childhood home in glimpses, and the woman's form becomes clearer. She is the composite of many people I loved and lost over the years, culminating in one painful final realization.

That last devastating event - the loss of my wife and child in a car crash - has left an indelible scar on my heart. The trauma of their deaths still reverberates through me and shapes my waking thoughts. Confronting it in such a terrifyingly real dreamscape forces reality upon me...

Still I continue on through this hellish portrait of the mind, desperately seeking not the impossibility of reunification, but understanding of what came to pass in a tragic way, on what should have been a normal day out for my young family.
