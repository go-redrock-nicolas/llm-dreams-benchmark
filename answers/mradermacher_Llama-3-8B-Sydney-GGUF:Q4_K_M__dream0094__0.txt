I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world filled with vibrant colors and sounds.  I am floating on a cloud of white cottony
fluff that feels so soft and cozy against my skin.  I can see the stars twinkling in the night sky above me and hear the songs of
birds chirping in the trees around me.  I feel happy and free.

But then, something happens that changes everything.  Out of nowhere, a huge black shadow appears in front of me, blocking out the light
from the stars.  It is shapeless and formless, but I can tell it is filled with malevolence and hatred.  It starts to approach me,
slowly and menacingly.

I try to escape by flying away from it, but it follows me wherever I go.  I try to fight back by using my magic powers, but they don't
work against it.  I try to pray for help, but there is no one who can save me.

I realize that this is my worst fear come true - facing an unstoppable force of evil alone in the dark.  I feel helpless and hopeless.
My only hope is that this dream will end soon before it consumes me completely.
