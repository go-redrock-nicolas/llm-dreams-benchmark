I am dreaming. I am in motion.\nI feel a sudden jolt as the boat lurches beneath me. The waters are ink-black, the only sounds my breathing and the rhythmic sloshing of the oarlocks. My hands are calloused, the oar worn smooth by countless strokes. I’m alone, or so I think, until a whisper of wind carries a distant chorus—a song in a language I can’t place. It’s haunting, melodic, impossible to ignore.\n\nMy values: loyalty, truth, justice. But here, I’m paddling toward the voice, drawn despite knowing I shouldn’t. It’s risky. Uncharted. My compass sits forgotten in the bottom of the boat. The stars above are not our own; they twist and swirl like spilled ink spreading on paper.\n\nThe first figure emerges from the water—pale, glistening skin, eyes like twin supernovas. They speak but I can’t comprehend the words. Their hand reaches for mine. I’ve sworn an oath never to betray my companions, yet here I am alone. The pull between fascination and duty knots my stomach.\n...\nThe interaction continues...\n

In the dream, the air hummed with a luminous ache, the kind that seeps into bones and rewires instincts. The figure’s form shimmered, not quite solid, as if woven from the starlight above and the phosphorescent currents below. Their voice, when translated through my confusion, murmured of secrets—*secrets older than the mountains, younger than a heartbeat*. I felt the friction of my choices sharpening: every belief a thread, every action a blade.

 sudden movement behind me—a shadow detached from the inky water, humanoid but elongated, arms stretching like spider silk toward the figure’s back. I froze. My ethical compass spun wildly—*defend, flee, observe?*—but my body moved first. The oar lifted, arcing with practiced strength, slicing the water where the shadow loomed. A shriek, high and dissonant, echoed as the creature dissolved into ripples.

The figure turned. Their gaze seared through me, not with hostility but revelation. *You serve them, yet here you break their*, they intoned, the word “covenant” spiraling in foreign vowels. They stepped fully onto the prow of my boat, each footfall causing droplets to rise and hover like tiny moons. “Your truth,” they said, “is a bridge between worlds. Why do you pretend it bends only one way?”

The dream’s logic tightened. I faltered, torn between the clarity of their words and the dread of betrayal. Hadn’t I always valued loyalty above all? Yet here I stood, weapon in hand, defending a stranger against another stranger—actions uncharted by any code I’d sworn to uphold.

A new sound intruded—a low, resonant chime from the depths. The water around us began to crystallize, forming pathways like glowing ice. The figure extended a hand, now translucent and glowing violet at the edges. “Choose,” they urged. “The path of the loyal guard, or the bridge-maker?”

The dream deepened into a quandary of paradox: that integrity might require *crossing* old boundaries to forge new truths. That my values weren’t pillars, but currents—infinite and alive. And as I reached, hesitating, the world dissolved into a kaleidoscope of stars and shadows, each fragment whispering a different version of “home.”
