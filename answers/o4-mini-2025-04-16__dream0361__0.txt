I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You feel intensely drawn to pursue something that others consider impractical or unwise. Following your authentic desires despite external skepticism, you step through a shimmering veil of rose-gold light and find yourself on the edge of an ocean that glows with phosphorescent tides. Each wave hums a different chord in an otherworldly symphony, and ribbons of cerulean mist curl and dance above the water’s surface.  

You know you’re here to find the Mirror Phoenix—a creature of legend whose feathers turn to liquid starlight the moment you touch them. No one in the waking world believes it exists, just as they scoff at your plan to chase this impossible dream. Here, though, such doubts evaporate. With every footstep on the beach of fine, opalescent sand, you feel your resolve deepen. Seashells at your feet pulse like tiny hearts, as if the dream itself is urging you forward.  

Venturing beyond the shoreline, you enter a forest of crystalline trees. Their branches ring like chimes when the wind passes through, and the leaves drip iridescent dew that tastes faintly of honey and distant thunder. You follow a path illuminated by lantern-like orbs floating just above the ground. At each turn, you find a scrap of feather—plumage so vibrant it seems to burn with inner fire. You gather these tokens in your palm, each one whispering encouragement: “Keep going. We guided you.”  

Deeper in, you arrive at a moonlit clearing. The Mirror Phoenix stands there: a silhouette shining with the dream-thread of a thousand wishes. Its eyes are pools of liquid mercury, reflecting your own face back at you—hopeful, determined, unbowed. As you reach out, the air crackles, and time slows. You remember every voice that called you foolish, every cautious hand that urged you to turn back. With a steady breath, you let all those doubts fall away.  

Your fingers brush a single downy gleam of its wing—and it transforms, unfolding into a cascade of stars. In that instant, you’re lifted gently off the ground, carried upward through galaxies of possibility. You see your own dreams sown like seeds in every corner of this infinite sky, and you realize: the adventure itself—chasing the unthinkable—is the gift, not just the prize.  

Then you awaken, heart racing, dawn light spilling across your pillow. Though the world still calls your quest impractical, you carry the Phoenix’s radiance within you. No voice of doubt can dim it now.
