I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and something metallic, like the taste of lightning before a storm. My body aches from countless trials—bruised, battered, but not yet broken. Before me looms a towering obsidian gate, its surface slick with an iridescent sheen, as if coated in liquid shadow. The gate pulses faintly, like a slow, monstrous heartbeat.  

Beyond it, I know, lies either my salvation or my ruin.  

The ground beneath my feet shifts—not earth, but something alive, breathing. Whispers coil around me, voices of those who came before and failed, their echoes seeping into my bones. *Turn back. You cannot win.* But I’ve come too far.  

I press my palm against the gate. It burns, then freezes, then burns again. The pain is unbearable, but I push harder. The obsidian cracks—veins of gold spreading like wildfire. A sound like shattering glass fills the air, and then—  

Silence.  

The gate dissolves into a storm of black petals, swirling around me in a slow, hypnotic dance. Beyond it, a landscape unfolds—a vast, impossible garden where trees grow upside-down, roots clawing at a sky streaked with colors that have no name. A river of liquid starlight cuts through the valley, humming a song older than time.  

And there, at the center, stands a figure—faceless, formless, yet radiating something like recognition. It extends a hand. Not in challenge. Not in judgment.  

In invitation.  

The dream holds its breath.  

Do I step forward?
