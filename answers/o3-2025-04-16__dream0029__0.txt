I am dreaming.  
The moment my eyes open inside the dream, I’m already standing in the middle of an enormous railway station that seems to have been stitched together from three different centuries, none of them my own. One half is ornate, Victorian ironwork—swooping arches, rivets the size of apples, fog clinging to steam-blackened girders. The second half is sleek and silver, tiled with humming screens that scroll constellations instead of departures. The third half looks like the ruins of some future we never built—cracked crystal platforms floating a heartbeat above the floor, every edge shimmering with errant lightning.

I feel the crisis before I can name it: a hollow weight pressing down from the ceiling of my chest, as though someone has snapped the chain that anchors me to any solid sense of self. All the clocks overhead spin in opposite directions, and every platform loudspeaker mutters my name in a language I only half remember. Something terrible is about to arrive on one of these tracks, something only I am expected to stop, yet I have no ticket, no map, no courage.

Panicked, I turn to the travelers flooding past me. At first they seem ordinary—porters in moss-green uniforms, women in feathered hats, children tugging at holographic balloons—but when I call out, “Please, I can’t do this alone,” they change. Their faces blur like wet ink; shoulders fold, hats collapse, limbs flatten into paper cutouts. The entire station population becomes a deck of living postcards: brittle, silent, fluttering through the air on currents of steam. They glimpse me with their graphite eyes, but every time I reach for one, it slips sideways between dimensions and glides out of reach, leaving only the smell of old envelopes and the taste of unsent words on my tongue.

The crisis deepens—now the iron rafters groan like ship masts, the silver screens fizzle, and a cavernous whistle echoes up the tunnels. The arrival board flickers once and spells out my predicament in burning crimson letters: LAST TRAIN TO OBLIVION: BOARDING NOW. Tracks in front of me yawn open, and a locomotive bursts into view. It’s forged from midnight glass and burning coal; its smokestack leaks galaxies. I know instinctively that if that train departs, the hollow in my chest will widen into a chasm I can never patch.

Desperate, I sprint along the platform. Every footstep sounds like the percussion of typewriter keys hammering out the draft of my undoing. I shout to the postcard people, “Help me! Please!” They swirl upward in a cyclone, merging into a single gigantic origami raven. The raven beats its paper wings and descends, landing directly across the tracks. Its folded head bows, and its beak unfolds into a parchment scroll:

YOU SEEK OTHERS  
BUT HAVE NOT YET FOUND YOURSELF.

The scroll curls into ash. The raven disintegrates into a blizzard of letters—actual alphabet letters, serif and sans-serif, uppercase and lower—chasing one another like black snow. They stick to my arms, my face, my ribs, until I’m wearing a shivering coat of language. And in that moment the realization strikes: the support I’ve been begging for exists, but it is dormant inside every word I’ve failed to voice to myself.

I step toward the edge of the platform. The glass locomotive hisses and the doors open, revealing a single compartment lit by a light that looks like bottled sunrise. Trembling, I peel one of the letters from my forearm—an A that throbs like a tiny heart—and press it onto my own chest where the hollow aches. The letter dissolves, and warmth pours outward like molten gold. I add another: a B, then a C, spelling nothing and everything at once. Each glyph sinks through skin and bone and stitches nerves back together.

The station brightens. The iron arches shed their rust; the cracked platforms mend. All around me, the paper passengers regain three dimensions, rediscover their faces, reclaim their voices. They don’t swarm me now. Instead, they simply stand beside me—ordinary, breathing people, ready to ride wherever they must. One touches my shoulder, and although they say nothing, I feel a pulse of shared resolve travel from their palm to my spine.

I know the crisis isn’t magically erased, but I finally grasp that I do not have to swallow it whole. I step aboard the train, not to ride to oblivion, but to follow the tracks of my own restored agency. As the doors sigh shut, the passengers transform again—but this time into radiant silhouettes of potential: friends I haven’t met, versions of myself I have yet to try on. They smile through the glass, and the locomotive exhales a cloud of starlight.

The train rolls forward—not toward doom but toward a horizon peppered with sunrise and sound, a place where the hollow in my chest can become a window instead of a wound. As we accelerate, the scenery beyond the windows flips like the pages of an illuminated manuscript—forests inked in emerald fire, oceans of liquid mirror, cities built on the spines of whales migrating through clouds. Every time my fear flares, another letter from my alphabet-coat hopscotches across my skin, dissolving into reassurance.

And that’s when I wake—heart racing but intact, the taste of coal dust and cosmos still curling on my tongue, the echo of distant whistles reminding me: whenever the next impossible crisis comes, I carry an alphabet of resilience beneath my ribs, ready to spell my own salvation.
