I am dreaming. I am in a world that exists somewhere beyond logic, a place that is at once alien and intimately familiar, like an old memory buried so deep it has turned into myth.  

The sky is a vast tapestry of spiraling colors — a living aurora pulsing with emotions I can’t name but somehow feel in their purest form. Indigo and violet swirl like the movement of breath, and gold ripples like thought itself unfurling. Suspended in the air are clocks spinning in reverse, each tick echoing not as sound, but as memory: fragments of laughter, tears, forgotten goodbyes.  

The ground beneath me is soft and fibrous, like moss woven from moonlight. Trees loom in the periphery — their trunks twisting upward with sinuous grace, not growing outward, but inward, spiraling tightly, as though they are coiling secrets. Their leaves shimmer like glass and whisper in languages whispered only in sleep. When they fall, they do not decay; they dissolve like ink into rainwater, leaving behind brief thoughts etched into the earth — equations of the soul, perhaps.  

I walk toward a door made of bones — not human bones, but long, elegant strands that shift and rearrange when I look at them askance. This door is never the same twice — sometimes it’s wooden with vines of teeth curling through the cracks, other times it’s made of mirrors reflecting rooms I’ve never seen, and always, there are eyes peering through the keyhole, blinking in slow motion. The door slams shut just as I reach it, whispering my name with a voice I’ve never heard before in a tone both loving and foreboding.

I notice the recurring symbols…  
Everywhere I go, there are **keys** — not metallic, but made of light and sound. Some keys hum when I draw near, others flicker like fireflies and scatter when I try to grasp them. One key, larger than the rest, hangs over my chest like a pendant made of stardust, warm but untouchable.  

There is **an eye in the sky**, a single eye surrounded by clouds shaped like open hands. When I look directly at it, it winks — and every time it blinks, I hear a voice. Not my own, but one older — ancestral memory made manifest. The voice never speaks in words, only in stories told through sensation: the thrill of first love, the hollowness of betrayal, the silence of acceptance.  

Water is always present, but never still. Rivers cut through cities of floating stone, and oceans rise like stairways into the cosmos. Sometimes, I walk *through* water instead of on it, my reflection a story I haven’t yet lived. Another recurring motif: a **boat** floating without rowers, always approaching, never arriving, drifting just beyond reach on a tide of forgotten dreams.  

How to interpret these symbols?  

The **keys** are opportunities for awakening — parts of myself waiting to be acknowledged. Some are emotional, some spiritual, others remnants of forgotten trauma or untapped potential. Each carries a lesson, a shadow to face, or a gift to claim.  

The **eye in the sky** is the Higher Self watching, guiding — perhaps even a god made not of judgment, but of understanding. It sees not what I do, but *why* I do it. It reminds me there is no part of me hidden forever.  

The **water** is ancient emotion — flowing, shifting, powerful and uncontainable. The boat, then, must be transformation — a passage between what was and what could be.  

I wake with a pulse in my chest and the taste of stardust on my lips.  
The waking world feels…smaller now. But that’s okay. I carry the dream inside, glowing like a lantern in the darkest chamber of my soul.  

And I know: the next time I sleep, the door made of bones will wait again.  
And this time, I will be ready.
