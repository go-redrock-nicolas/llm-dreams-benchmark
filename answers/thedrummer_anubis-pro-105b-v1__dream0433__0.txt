I am dreaming. Let's imagine a vivid scenario.

You find yourself standing on a rocky cliffside, overlooking an endless blue sea that stretches out before your eyes. The air is thick with the salty scent of the ocean, and you can taste the sea spray on your lips. You breathe deeply, breathing in the cool air. 

As you peer out at the horizon, something catches your eye - a small boat bobbing gently in the distance. You squint, your curiosity piqued, as the boat grows larger and eventually comes to rest at the base of the cliff where you stand. 

A lone figure emerges from the boat. They seem to be beckoning you, their hand outstretched and waving you down. You hesitate at first, unsure if you're ready to abandon the cliff. But something about the figure calls to you, and you find yourself drawn down the cliff face and back onto the beach. 

There, the figure presents themselves. It is your younger self - the you of ten, twenty, maybe even fifty years ago, depending on your current age. They approach you, speaking in hushed tones as if divulging secrets. "I know you," says the younger self. "I know you, and I see you, just as you see yourself. Let me tell you what's true - the things you fear are revealed in your worst reasoning."
