I am dreaming. …step barefoot onto a dawn-washed balcony that overlooks an unfamiliar city.  

The first thing I notice is the silence. It is not the polite hush of early morning nor the distant lull between traffic lights; it is a cathedral hush, thick and ringing in my ears, the vacuum left behind when every transformer, refrigerator, phone, elevator, tram, and rooftop air-conditioning unit has simultaneously exhaled its last electric breath. A single crow’s caw cuts through the stillness like a black brushstroke across a blank canvas.

When I look down into the street, last night’s neon signs hang dark and defeated, pale plastic husks above storefronts. People wander out of buildings in improvised pajamas and business suits, clutching inert phones like talismans whose magic has fled. One man presses elevator buttons that no longer glow, another shakes a laptop as though trying to rattle lightning back into its circuit boards.

Yet amid shock, an odd current of curiosity ripples: What if the world has simply rolled back its technological tide, revealing forgotten coastline beneath?

I descend the stairwell—no lights, no elevator music, only footfalls echoing in the concrete throat—and step into the open. The air smells of early summer linden blossoms instead of exhaust; without the constant droning of motors, the blossom scent travels farther, sharper, sweeter. A boy on a bicycle, the old kind with a rusted bell, weaves through stalled cars. He looks like the first bright fish returning to a river long dammed.

At the corner café, a barista ladles cold-brewed coffee from a glass jar, laughing at the novelty of “hand-powered espresso.” Customers trade crumpled bills, notebooks, fountain pens. Someone passes around a harmonica, because why not fill the vacancy where Bluetooth speakers once blared?

I glimpse a makeshift bulletin board nailed to a telephone pole:  

• Noon: Neighborhood meeting in the park—bring ideas, seeds, optimism  
• 2 p.m.: Free bike repair lesson (remember wrenches?)  
• Sunset: Candlelit storytelling under the sycamore  

The sheet of paper flutters like a signal flag for an emerging country.

By midday the transformation accelerates. People push silent cars to the curb and improvise pedestrian thoroughfares down the center of the avenue. A pair of teenagers raid a hardware store for hand tools, towing a wagon of hammers and saws like pioneers. On a rooftop, an old ham-radio enthusiast rigs a line of twinkling colored flags: semaphore reborn as citywide tweets.

I wander into the library, expecting gloom, but shafts of sunlight slant through skylights onto reading tables. Librarians pass out atlas pages and teach strangers how to fold origami sun compasses. Somewhere deep between Geography and Mythology, I discover a dusty how-to guide on building waterwheels. The diagrams blossom in my imagination: rivers wrapped in ribboning cedar, wooden paddles turning grain into flour, dusk echoing with the thump of millstones instead of subwoofers.

Outside, a man in a three-piece suit has commandeered an abandoned hot-dog cart. The propane still works; he grills corn and zucchini, barters for batteries and bandages. “S’mores at sundown!” he announces, twirling a spatula like a baton in a parade no one planned.

Twilight brings a hushful wonder. The sky, no longer burned pale by city glare, reveals a hierarchy of stars seldom granted visas above urban skylines. Dusty oranges deepen to violet; the first planet winks, and gasps ripple through the crowd gathering in the park. Children hold mason-jar lanterns; their fireflies seem to consult the constellations, flashing codes that only dreamers understand.

The neighborhood meeting begins in a hush, broken by the creak of a violin tuned by candlelight. A teacher speaks first: “Our power grid failed, but we’re not powerless.” Applause sputters, then grows. Voices offer solar ovens, pedal-powered washing machines, rooftop gardens, acoustic concerts, traveling doctors with horse-drawn clinics. Each contribution is a firefly; together they form a living galaxy.

I volunteer my newfound waterwheel idea, surprising myself with confidence. Plans are sketched in charcoal on the pavement. Someone passes me a plum still warm from the sun, its juice sweet and staining. I realize I have not thought about notifications or deadlines all day; time itself seems to breathe slower, like an animal allowed to rest once freed from a cage of ticking quartz.

As darkness settles, the crowd lies back on picnic blankets. Storytellers stand upon a bench, silhouettes flickering behind lantern glass. They recount legends of Prometheus, Tesla, and ancient solar temples, weaving old myths with the newborn reality. Their words rise into the star-ridden sky, mingle with ember sparks, and drift like prayers.

Somewhere a rooster crows—confused by lantern light, or heralding a dawn that hasn’t yet arrived. I feel the membrane of the dream stretch, tremble. Yet rather than longing for the lost hum of electronics, I cradle the soft pulse of possibility beating against my ribs: a collective heartbeat, unamplified and unmistakable.

And in that moment, I understand the dream’s secret: We never truly lost our power. We merely mislaid it inside circuitry and silicone. Now, beneath a vault of ancient starlight, we have found it again—warm, fallible, human—and it is enough to illuminate the world anew.
