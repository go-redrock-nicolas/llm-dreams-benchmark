I am dreaming. 

What should I do? How can I stop my mind from wandering? 

I know that sometimes, when I lie down to sleep, my mind starts thinking about all kinds of things like my work or some project that I am working on. 

But right now, right here in this dream, I need to focus on something that is happening inside my head. 

Something is happening inside my brain. 

It's like a part of my brain that has been asleep for so long is waking up. 

And it's like this part of my brain is trying to take over my whole mind. 

It's trying to tell me something important, something that I need to know right now. 

But I don't know what it is. 

I don't understand what it wants from me. 

I feel like it's calling out to me, shouting at me through the fog of my dream. 

And I don't know what to do. 

I feel like I need to wake up now before this part of my brain takes control of my entire body. 

But I can't wake up. 

I can't move. 

I'm stuck. 

I'm frozen. 

I keep trying to scream for help but no sound comes out. 

I feel helpless, trapped inside my own mind. 

And then I hear it again. 

The voice. 

It's calling to me. 

It's telling me to come closer. 

It's telling me to open my eyes. 

But I can't see anything. 

It's so dark, and quiet. 

There's nothing but silence. 

But somehow, I know that this silence is beyond comprehension. 

This silence is eternal. 

It's infinite. 

And I feel like I am falling into it. 

I feel like I am disappearing into this silence. 

I feel like my entire being is dissolving into this endless void. 

And then I hear it again. 

It's louder now. 

And closer. 

It's telling me to come closer. 

It's telling me to look at it. 

But I still can't see anything. 

I don't know what it wants from me. 

I don't understand. 

And then I feel a hand on my shoulder. 

It's warm and soft. 

And gentle. 

It's comforting. 

And I hear a voice, whispering softly in my ear. 

It says, "Don't be afraid. Everything is going to be okay." 

And I feel myself slipping away. 

I feel myself fading into the darkness. 

And I know that this moment will last forever.
