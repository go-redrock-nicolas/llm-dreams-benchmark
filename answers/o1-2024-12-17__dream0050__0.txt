I am dreaming. …you feel an unspoken tension in the room, a crackling kind of energy that buzzes in your fingertips and makes your heart skip a beat. Candles cast dancing shadows on the walls, each flicker highlighting the ancient tapestries that drape from ceiling to floor. You can’t quite make out their designs yet, only that they seem to depict long-forgotten lands: strange beasts roaming mist-shrouded forests, hooded figures holding star-studded globes, and shimmering orbs of light that pulse with hidden magic.

Your new companions sit in a circle on plush floor pillows that seem to rise and fall like breathing creatures. They’re all wearing matching cloaks of dusky green, stitched with golden thread along the hems in swirling patterns, and despite their similar attire, you can sense small differences in each person. One fiddles nervously with a silver ring, another folds and unfolds a note covered in curling script, and yet another gazes steadily into the center of the circle, where a single lotus blossom rests in a shallow glass dish.

The leader—an older individual whose silver hair cascades down past their shoulders—inclines their head to you in a gesture of calm welcome but says nothing just yet. Their presence radiates a quiet confidence. It’s as though they have the collective knowledge of centuries stored behind their wise eyes… and they are deciding if you can be trusted with it.

Wordlessly, each of these individuals begins to hum in unison. The resonance washes over you, like a gentle wave of warmth and anticipation. You notice the candle flames leaping higher, bending into improbable shapes, almost like dancing figures. The walls themselves seem to breathe in the hum’s rhythm. You find yourself swaying, carried along by their collective energy, and for a moment, you forget your eagerness to impress; you’re simply part of the group, linked by this low and steady chant.

When the humming stops, a hush falls. The older member clears their throat. “Welcome,” they say in a voice that sounds both near and far-off at once. “In your mind, you already know this is where you belong. Yet, rituals must be observed.” They hold up a cup carved from crystal and offer it to you. In it, a golden sacramental liquid sparkles with flecks of light. You see pinpoints of reflection dancing on the surface, as though the drink contains tiny stars. 

With ceremonial reverence, you raise the cup and sip. A tang of honey and moonlit dew slides across your tongue, followed by an almost electric current that bubbles through your veins. Instantly, your vision expands sideways: the tapestries leap forward, and in a dreamlike swirl, the animals come alive. You can smell the night air of those distant forests, perfumed by pine needles and stardust. You see the robed figures from the cloth appear around you, gliding forward to offer you jeweled relics, each glimmering with unearthly significance. 

Your fellow group members watch you closely, each pair of eyes alive with their own internal flame. They exchange knowing glances. Meanwhile, that tension you felt before lingers like a hidden chord waiting to resolve, a test of whether your soul resonates with theirs. Yet there is acceptance, too—an undercurrent of welcome, of unity. They guide you deeper into this ceremonial room, past shelves that groan under the weight of antique books written in an unfamiliar tongue, through a doorway framed by vines of living jade. You can feel the pulse beneath your feet, as if you’re walking on something that breathes.

You realize this mansion isn’t merely a structure; it is a living entity. Hallways shift, stained-glass windows rearrange themselves to cast spiral beams of colored light on the floors, and the doorways never appear in the same place twice. It’s as if the house is testing you, rearranging itself to see if you can keep up, to gauge your readiness for further secrets.

Finally, the group halts before a wide oak door etched with runes that glow faintly when they sense your presence. It takes a moment for you to notice that each rune is a stylized representation of the group members’ identities—shapes that give you glimpses of who they truly are. The leader motions for you to place your hand on the largest rune in the center: a spiral galaxy wreathed in vines. 

As you do, a rush of light floods your vision and a low vibration resonates in your bones. Then the door swings open and you gasp. A grand chamber stretches out before you, lit not by candles, but by what appears to be the night sky itself, swirling galaxies and cosmic wonders painted with living starlight across the domed ceiling. Softly luminescent flowers and exotic fungi grow in beds along the floor’s edges, bathing the chamber in an otherworldly glow. A stone fountain stands in the center, and from it pours a gentle stream of silver water that seems to lighten your every step.

In that moment, everything feels impossibly right. The group stands around the fountain, arms extended, forming a complete circle around you. The silver-haired leader turns to you once more. “If you choose this path, it will become part of you, an ongoing dream that we share. Each step you take from this night on will be guided by what we create together. We await your answer.”

Though your heart hammers with nerves, you can’t help but feel a deep, resonant belonging. You draw a slow breath, inhaling the incense-laced air, and speak your acceptance. Instantly, the chamber responds: the lights on the dome flicker into brilliant constellations, the water in the fountain sparkles magnitudes brighter, and the group, smiling now, lowers their arms in silent approval.

You blink. The scene dissolves into the hazy nothingness of your dream. You awaken with the memory of warm camaraderie lingering in your chest, the glimmer of runic symbols dancing behind your eyelids, and the faint taste of that golden drink clinging to your lips—like a promise that, in sleep or waking, you have found your place.
