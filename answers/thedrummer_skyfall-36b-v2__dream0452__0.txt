I am dreaming. I find myself in a lush, overgrown garden, the air thick with the scent of jasmine and the distant tunes of wind chimes. The once vibrant flowers I nurtured with great care have begun to wilt, their petals drooping and their colors fading into monotonous shades of grey. The soil beneath my feet feels barren, cracked from neglect.

Walking through the garden, I come across an ancient, gnarled tree I remember once bearing sweet fruit. But now, its branches are bare, and a deep sadness emanates from its trunk. As I approach, the tree whispers to me in a raspy voice:

"I was once a source of nourishment, shade, and joy. But you have stopped tending to me, pulling back your love and attention. I am withering away because you have made this choice. It is time to stop forcing our bond, because it's killing us both."

The tree's words resonate deep within my soul. I realize that, like this noble guardian, a relationship I once cherished has gradually transformed into a draining entanglement. The connection that once felt effortless now requires me to pour in energy I no longer have to spare.

As I turn away from the dying tree, the garden begins to fade and the landscape morphs into a murky, starless night. Suddenly, a luminous figure appears before me - a wizened elder with kind, piercing eyes and a gentle smile. He speaks to me:

"You cannot force the flow of life. What once enriches you may become a toxic tether. Honor the evolution of your relationship and respect your own needs. A sad goodbye paves the way for rebirth. Embrace your truth."

With that, a sense of calmness washes over me. I understand that I must release what no longer serves me, so that I can bloom anew in my own unique existence. I wake, feeling clear, connected, and curious to discover the next chapter of my journey with an open heart and a spirit ready to soar.
