I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt lavender and salt, a fragrance you’ve never known yet somehow remember. Beneath your feet, the ground is not earth but a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a different moment from your life—except now, the scenes are warped, glowing with hues they never held before. A childhood bedroom flickers in cobalt blue, its walls breathing like lungs. The closet door, once a gaping mouth of shadows, now spills golden light, and inside, your younger self sits cross-legged, weaving a crown of thorns into a wreath of fireflies. They look up at you, not with fear, but a quiet defiance that makes your chest ache. *This is where you learned to burn*, the child whispers, and the words dissolve into smoke that curls around your fingers like a lover.  

Above, the sky is a rotating kaleidoscope of teeth and constellations. A clockwork moon ticks backward, unraveling seconds into forgotten hours. You walk—or float—past forests of glass trees whose leaves are made of frozen screams, their branches clawing at a horizon that keeps retreating. A river materializes, not of water but liquid starlight, and in it, you see the faces of people you’ve loved and lost. But here, they are not who you remember. Your mother’s laughter is a storm of sparrows; your first heartbreak’s voice is a cello made of bone. They beckon you to wade in, and when you do, the light seeps into your skin, rewriting your scars into maps of uncharted galaxies.  

A door floats by, half-melted like a Dali watch. Behind it, you glimpse a version of yourself who never fled that haunted house on the edge of town. This twin wears your regrets like armor, their eyes twin supernovae. “You called it courage,” they say, their voice echoing like a cathedral bell. “But it was just the first note of a song you were too afraid to finish.” You reach out, but the door dissolves, and suddenly you’re falling—not down, but *through*—layers of memory and myth, until you land in a garden where your darkest secrets bloom as flowers. The petals are razor-thin, yet when you touch them, they heal the wounds they once inflicted.  

A phoenix made of ash and violin strings soars overhead, singing a lullaby you hummed to yourself at age six. You realize now it was never a dirge, but a spell to resurrect joy from the rubble of your own making. The ground shifts again, becoming a tapestry of old letters you never sent, their ink bleeding into rivers that carve new stories onto your palms. A figure approaches, half-shadow, half-sunrise. They wear your face, but their eyes are twin eclipses, swallowing and rebirthing light. “You thought these were ruins,” they say, gesturing to the landscape. “But they were always a cathedral. Every crack, a hymn. Every ghost, a brick.”  

When you wake, the dream clings to you like perfume. The past is no longer a graveyard, but a prism. You wonder if pain was never the enemy, but the loom on which you wove yourself into a myth. And somewhere, deep in your bones, the fireflies in your chest hum in agreement.
