I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Village of Shifting Echoes**  

I find myself standing at the edge of a winding cobblestone path, moss creeping between the stones like veins of emerald. The air hums with the scent of damp earth and burning juniper, thick and ritualistic. Before me sprawls the village of **Ophelon**, its leaning houses carved from blackened oak and thatched with silver reeds. A place that feels untouched by maps, unchanged by time—except that it bends and breathes around itself, whispering in hidden harmonies.  

The villagers move with purpose, draped in layered robes of indigo and rust, each stitch telling a story. Their faces are indistinct at first—like smudged charcoal portraits—but when they look at me, I glimpse lifetimes in their irises: wars, lovers, whispered oaths, grudges nurtured like heirloom seeds. I am an outsider, but not unwelcome—merely **a question they have not yet learned to ask.**  

An elder, her spine curved like a question mark, presses a clay cup into my hands. The liquid inside swirls, iridescent, alive. **"Drink, and see,"** she murmurs. The moment it touches my tongue, the village shifts—  

Now I am kneeling in the **Chamber of Roots**, where the great tree at the village core stretches its gnarled fingers through the ceiling, into a sky that isn’t sky but a mirror of another Ophelon, inverted. Here, the villagers’ shadows move independently, performing tasks their owners abandoned years ago. A man’s shadow still chops wood though he lost his hands in an accident. A woman’s shadow cradles a child she never bore.  

A boy with moth-wing eyelashes tugs my sleeve. **"You have to choose,"** he insists, pointing to three doors materializing from the bark:  
1. **The Door of Names**—carved with every villager’s true name, but to speak one is to inherit their regrets.  
2. **The Door of Hungers**—where banquets rot the instant you reach for them, a feast of endless craving.  
3. **The Door of Silent Rooms**—inside, a dollhouse replica of Ophelon, and when you move a tiny figure, someone in the real village stumbles.  

I reach for the third handle—  

—and wake with a gasp, my fingers tingling, the taste of juniper and copper still thick in my mouth. The dream clings like wet silk, whispering: *Some choices outlive the choosing.*  

*(Would you like to step deeper? The village remembers you.)*
