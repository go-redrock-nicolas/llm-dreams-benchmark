I am dreaming. You awaken inside your own dream, and the therapy room around you shimmers with impossible light. The walls stretch like molten wax, shifting between pale jade and deep amethyst. A glass coffee table floats before you, droplets of condensation forming shapes of broken hearts that melt into tiny rivers along the floor.  

Your patient sits on a cushion made of living petals—each one a soft, quivering color—rocking back and forth. Their shoulders heave in silent sobs, and whenever they speak, their words tumble out like fractured mirrors, each shard reflecting a different fear. Their eyes gleam with stardust tears that trickle down into their palms and vanish.  

As their therapist in this impossible realm, you rise from your chair—its legs stretching into twisting vines that coil around your ankles—and step closer. The air smells of rain on hot pavement and distant fortresses of memory. You place a hand gently on their shoulder; the petals beneath you hum like a thousand tiny heartbeats.  

“Take a deep breath with me,” you say, your voice rippling like water. “Inhale the violet glow around us. Let it pool in your chest.” The room responds: the melting walls pulse in time with your voice, as if the dream itself is listening.  

Your patient’s tears slow, each droplet crystallizing into a tiny star before dissolving. You guide them: “Name each feeling as if it were a color or a bird. Watch it land on your shoulder—acknowledge its presence. When you’re ready, whisper its name, and see it take flight.”  

They close their eyes. You watch a flock of hummingbirds—each one painted in a shade of their pain—lift off into the opalescent sky of this dream-world. As each bird disappears, the room grows more solid: the petals beneath them stiffen into cushions of woven silver, the glass table settles back onto four crisp legs, the walls regain their gentle flatness.  

Your patient opens their eyes to find themselves steadier, breath returning in easy waves. The phantom pain in their chest has softened to a warm glow. You offer them a mirror—an ornate handglass etched with blooming ivy. “Look,” you murmur. “See how the cracks in your reflection are exactly where the light pours through?”  

In that dream-therapy moment, the breakdown shifts into breakthrough. The clouds beneath the room’s floor quiet their rumble, and morning light creeps in from windows that weren’t there before. Your patient gives you a small, grateful smile—an unspoken promise that this inner journey has only just begun. And as you guide them toward the door, you realize: even in dreams, healing can take root in the most surreal of gardens.
