I am dreaming. I drift into the spiral of a dream where the very air feels charged with buzzing deadlines. At first, the office around me is perfectly ordinary: soft fluorescent lights overhead, pale gray cubicle walls, the hum of computers processing endless spreadsheets. But before I even realize it, the floor beneath my feet begins to sag like warm taffy. My desk stretches into the distance, rows of it receding into a smoky horizon. Stacks of folders grow with furious speed, sprouting new labels—“URGENT,” “ASAP,” “CRITICAL”—each one glowing red as I approach.  

Voices echo from every corner: the gentle hum of a manager’s “just one more thing,” the urgent bark of a director demanding a presentation “by noon,” and the low, insistent drone of emails arriving faster than I can read them. They’re not just sounds anymore—they take shape as translucent silhouettes that drift toward me, each carrying another impossibly heavy box. I lift one box, then two, then twenty, and the weight pins my shoulders to the desk. The boxes grow warmer, pulsing like living creatures hungry for my attention.  

As the demands become physically impossible to meet, I feel my bones soften. My arms melt through the cardboard; my fingers stretch and tangle in its corrugated grooves. I’m drowning in paper, the ink bleeding off every sheet, turning waterways of black into a thick, tar-like sludge that threatens to swallow my entire body. The fluorescent lights warp into spiraling suns above me, each radiating a chorus of whispered tasks: “Revise, summarize, approve, deploy…”  

In panic, I push through a wall of filing cabinets that suddenly stand before me like a brick fortress. On the other side lies a sky of molten lavender, rivers of quicksilver flowing past floating islands of burning to-do lists. I step onto one island and feel it wobble, so I leap across the silver stream, its surface cold and slippery, reflecting a thousand versions of myself – me at 3 a.m., me with wild eyes scribbling notes, me collapsing onto the floor. With each leap, the islands shrink and drift apart, and I taste the metallic tang of fear on my tongue.  

Then—just as the ground falls away entirely—I find myself hovering in a vast, silent space. No folders, no voices, no weight. Only a single pulse of light in the distance. Drawn to it, I soar past galaxies of swirling memos that burst like fireworks, transforming into constellations of calm. When I touch the light, it unfurls into a soft, luminous notebook, its pages blank and waiting. I open it, and all the urgency melts away. I breathe in the hush of possibility, scribble a single word—“Enough”—and feel my shoulders loosen as I sink into warm, quiet darkness.  

Then I wake, my heart pounding, the memory of shapes and voices already slipping into shadow. But on my nightstand lies that glowing notebook, page one open and empty, reminding me that every impossible deadline eventually becomes only a dream.
