I am dreaming. …find yourself standing in the middle of a sun-drenched plaza that smells of cinnamon, diesel, and wet stone after rain. The country’s name escapes you—letters slip like silverfish through your memory—but its flag, a riot of saffron, indigo, and jade, flutters above the terracotta roofs like a restless bird.

A moment ago the square thrummed with laughter: street-musicians drumming on copper pots, vendors stacking pyramids of ruby-colored pomegranates, children chasing soap bubbles the size of lanterns. Then a ripple passes through the crowd. Radios crackle. Phones chime. Every face tilts toward an invisible horizon. Sirens wail—first one, thin and lonely, then a chorus that folds the afternoon light into jagged shards.

Someone shouts: “Borders are closed!”  
Another voice, trembling, “All trains have stopped!”  
And the plaza, once orchestral, shifts to a mute theater of wide eyes.

Panic skitters over your skin. You glance at the byzantine alleys yawning on all sides and try to recall the route back to your hostel—cobblestones twist and rearrange like a living labyrinth. The air itself thickens, tinted with static, as though the sky’s blue glaze has shattered into electric dust.

You bolt into a narrow street lined with mosaic-tiled archways. The lamps overhead are odd: glass globes filled with swirling ink that spells NEWS in a language you don’t recognize, letters looping around each other like startled eels. They flash crimson. Doors slam. Iron shutters clang down in a metallic wave. At the far end of the alley a gate descends—a portcullis of wrought-iron chrysanthemums—and you sprint, heart drumming, just squeezing beneath it as petals snap shut behind you.

On the other side is night. Impossible, because only seconds ago it was afternoon, but dreams bend clocks like soft wax. Lanterns float above a canal—luminescent koi, their scales etched with tiny maps of this very city. You hop onto a gondola tied with red silk. There’s no gondolier; instead, a violin leans against the prow, playing itself. Each note coaxes the water to ripple into images: crowds marching, flags burning, borders sealing with great stone slabs sliding into place. Yet when you touch the water, the visions fracture into harmless rings of moonlight.

The boat glides beneath bridges whose arches flash scenes from your own past travels: a café in Paris where you spilled espresso on a stranger’s notebook, a sunrise over Machu Picchu, the silhouette of a friend waving from a train window. Every memory flickers for a heartbeat, then dissolves into the canal’s ink.

Ahead, the waterway ends at a colossal wall made of passports mortared together—millions of little booklets, their covers shimmering like beetle wings. Some bear your photograph but different names, alternate histories branching like coral. A single door stands in the wall, fashioned from translucent paper. Written across it in charcoal strokes: “SOVEREIGNTY OF DREAMERS.”

Your anxiety spikes—if borders in waking life are closed, what about borders in dreams? But a voice, soft and steady, echoes inside your ribcage:

Remember: You are dreaming.

You press your palm to the paper door. It melts into mist and reforms around your fingers like warm honey. The wall of passports breathes, pages fluttering in an unseen wind, and then opens outward with a sigh.

Beyond lies a station platform carved from mother-of-pearl. Trains made of stained glass stand waiting, their carriages glowing from within—roses, whales, constellations sliding across the panes. A conductor in a suit of origami cranes bows and hands you a ticket. The parchment reads:

Destination: Safe Return  
Class: Lucid Voyager  
Platform: 11¾, Track of Possibility

The conductor tips his paper hat. “Borders are stories,” he says, each crane on his jacket folding and refolding. “And stories belong to dreamers.”

You step onto a carriage whose windows reveal not the platform behind you but rolling fields of silver grass beneath an aurora shaped like calligraphy. Seats are velvet clouds; luggage racks shimmer with fireflies. The train hums, lifts from the tracks, and sails into the sky, threading between constellations that rearrange themselves into familiar faces encouraging you onward.

As the locomotive gathers speed, your pulse slows. The unrest, the fear, the shuttered gates—all shrink to the size of postage stamps pinned to an infinite corkboard of night. Somewhere below, sirens still cry, but up here they sound like distant gulls.

The conductor strolls past, offering cups of chrysanthemum tea that tastes of summers you haven’t lived yet. You sip, warmth spreading through your chest, dissolving the last knots of dread. Stars drift in through open windows and settle on your shoulders like sequins.

Ahead, a horizon of sunrise unfurls—liquid gold poured over the edge of the world. The train whistles, a bright, beckoning note. You realize the ticket in your hand has transformed, its ink blooming into new words:

Wake gently. Carry wonder across every border you meet.

The aurora parts, revealing a doorway of dawn, and the train glides through. Light floods the carriage, white and forgiving. Your eyelids grow heavy—not with sleep, but with the nearness of waking. The dream scrawls one final message across the skies:

Fear is a gate; imagination, the key.

And with that, you exhale, feel sheets beneath your fingertips, morning birdsong at your window, and slip gracefully from dream to day—heart still fluttering like a passport stamp, mind bright with the certainty that some borders can never hold you.
