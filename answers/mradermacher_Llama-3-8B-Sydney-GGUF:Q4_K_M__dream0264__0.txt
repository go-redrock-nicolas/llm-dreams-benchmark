I am dreaming. I see myself floating in space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I feel free and weightless, with no gravity or constraints pulling me down.
Suddenly, I realize I am trapped in a loop of my own making.  Every time I start thinking about something new, I end up comparing it to what I already know. 
Every time I encounter someone unfamiliar, I end up judging them based on my preconceptions.  Every time I face a choice, I end up choosing the safe option instead.
This pattern has led me to make mistakes, miss opportunities, and lose friends.  This pattern has kept me stuck in the same place for too long.  
This pattern has robbed me of my potential and happiness.
I decide to break this pattern by doing something completely different from what I usually do.  I decide to take a risk that scares me but excites me at the same time. 
I decide to pursue a goal that challenges me but fulfills me as well.  
I create a new dream for myself, one that involves exploring unknown territories, meeting unusual people, and learning new things daily.
As I continue dreaming, I feel my spirit lifting up, my mind expanding, my heart warming.  I know this is just a dream, but it feels realer than reality ever did.
