I am dreaming. You close your eyes—and suddenly you’re standing beneath an opal sky that ripples with living color, as if the sunset itself were breathing. The air tastes of crushed jasmine and warm honey, drifting in tendrils that coil around your senses. In this dream-world you’ve been claimed by a people who call themselves the Aurali, and already you sense that nothing you once knew of friendship or family will prepare you for their ways.

A cluster of tall, slender figures approaches, their bodies swaying in perfect symmetry. Their skin shimmers with subtle patterns—waves of teal pulsing into gold—each marking a lifelong bond they share with others in the circle. When they speak, it isn’t in words but in soft, harmonic tones that ebb and flow like water lapping on a shore. You try to reply, but your voice cracks into a squeak; instead they lean close and brush their fingertips lightly across your wrist. Instantly, a cascade of feelings blooms in your chest: curiosity, welcome, a pinch of playful mischief you didn’t know you had.

They usher you into a cathedral made entirely of living vines and phosphorescent flowers, where relationships are woven like tapestries: every new connection spins a silken thread, visible in the air as glowing filaments. You watch, astonished, as two Aurali join their threads—one green, one rose—to form a living braid that wiggles and pulses between them, signifying a bond deeper than marriage, more fluid than friendship. A third figure edges closer and gently weaves their thread too, creating an intricate triad that hums with shared harmony. In Aurali culture, love and loyalty are not exclusive; they believe the heart’s capacity is limitless, and bonds can grow into living art.

You attempt a greeting of your own. Gathering courage, you pluck a single vine flower—its petals like translucent silk—and hold it out. The Auralis’ luminous eyes flutter in delight. In response, they entwine your flower into their communal tapestry. At once, you feel their joys and grievances: the echo of a lost sibling, the laughter they shared dancing beneath a red moon, the quiet ache of a promise unkept. It’s overwhelming—intimate emotions that rush in all at once. Your mind reels between elation and the weight of deepest nostalgia, as if you’ve inherited centuries of their personal histories in one gentle pulse.

Navigating further, you find spaces designed for “Emotional Counsel,” where Aurali gather in concentric rings and pass a single, glowing orb around. As each person cradles it, their innermost thought—hope, regret, longing—flares in color across the orb’s surface. When someone finds their color clashing with another’s, they step aside, form smaller rings, and work until their hues weave together in harmony once more. You join in, barely understanding the nuance, but your timid weave—a flicker of pale lavender—suffuses the orb with calm. The others murmur their approval in soft, cascading chords, and you realize you’ve just offered comfort in a language your tongue can’t form.

At midnight—or what you assume to be midnight here—the Aurali lead you to a vast lake of liquid starlight. They swim without sinking, arms arcing through the glowing water as if gravity has forgotten them. Hesitant, you wade in and find yourself buoyant; the lake lifts you high enough to see the city’s spires in the distance, each crowned with a living blossom that opens and closes in time to the people’s collective heartbeat. As you tread water, they circle you in a protective ring, singing a lullaby that vibrates through your bones. The melody carries you into a trance, and you glimpse your own threads—silver and pale green—twining effortlessly into theirs.

When you wake, you find your skin tingling with curious patterns that weren’t there before, and hear, still faintly, those oceanic harmonies beneath your pillow. You lie there, heart fluttering as if touched by someone else’s hand, wondering: was it a dream…or the first step into a world where connections are as alive and vibrant as the dawn?
