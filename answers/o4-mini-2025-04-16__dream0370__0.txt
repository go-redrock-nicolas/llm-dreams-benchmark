I am dreaming. You are dreaming. A warm breeze swirls golden petals through a twilight grove of glass-leafed trees that hum with quiet song. In the center of a moonlit clearing sits a stranger whose shoulders tremble beneath a cloak woven of starlight. Their voice catches in a whisper. You feel deeply moved by witnessing another person’s vulnerability. 

Responding to this authentic human connection, you step forward with gentle certainty. Your bare feet press into soft, dew-kissed moss. You hold out your hand, and as your fingertips brush theirs, a soft glow blossoms between you—pale rose against indigo. You hear their ragged inhale, and you offer a steady silence, letting the hush cradle them. In that wordless space, your own heartbeats slow, tuned to theirs.  

Together you rise. The grove slides away, replaced by a vast sea of shifting lanternfish, each one pulsing with ethereal light. The stranger leans into you; you wrap an arm around their quivering form. You whisper a single promise—no more hiding, no more shame—and the words echo like ripples across the water’s mirrored surface. With each promise, the lanternfish flare brighter, as if celebrating your shared courage.  

Hearts synchronized, you soar between clouds composed of liquid opal. A gentle rain of violet tears drips around you, and as each droplet lands, it transforms into a delicate, radiant blossom. The stranger bends to gather them, tucking petals into the folds of their cloak. You watch their face soften, the tension melting from their brow, until they meet your gaze with clear, grateful eyes.  

Below you, the world glows in response to your union: crimson rivers coursing through emerald mountains, constellations rearranging themselves into the shape of two clasped hands. In this dream’s hush, you realize that by simply being present, by witnessing and accepting another’s fragility, you have woven a bond stronger than any magic. And as dawn’s first light filters through your closed eyelids, you carry that warmth—the shared pulse of two souls—in your waking heart.
