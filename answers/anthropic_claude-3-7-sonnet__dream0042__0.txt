I am dreaming. I'm standing in the grand ballroom of a historic mansion, clipboard in hand, watching as workers transform the space for tomorrow's diplomatic summit. As the newly appointed head of international relations for our country, this event falls squarely on my shoulders—my first major test. Foreign dignitaries from twenty nations will gather here, and the peace treaty negotiations hinge on creating the perfect environment for dialogue.

The crystal chandeliers above me catch the afternoon light, casting prismatic patterns across the marble floor that's being meticulously polished. I check my watch—eighteen hours until the doors open.

"Ma'am, we have a situation." My assistant appears beside me, face drawn with worry. The custom-designed chairs, handcrafted to represent each nation's cultural heritage, are stranded at the border due to unexpected customs regulations. My stomach tightens as I make frantic calls, pulling diplomatic strings I barely understand.

As night falls, I notice the temperature in the room dropping precipitously. The ancient heating system has failed, and repair crews shake their heads—parts won't arrive until next week. I wrap my coat tighter, watching my breath form clouds in the air as I direct staff to source portable heaters from across the city.

Dawn breaks, and with it comes a call that the chef has fallen ill. His signature dish—symbolically incorporating ingredients from all twenty nations—was meant to be the summit's opening statement. I find myself in the kitchen, sleeves rolled up, attempting to recreate the recipe from his hurried instructions over the phone.

The first cars begin arriving as I'm still frantically arranging translation equipment that arrived with incorrect programming. My carefully constructed seating arrangement—months of research to ensure no historical enemies sit adjacent—has been scrambled in the computer system.

As the doors open and the first diplomats enter, I notice my formal attire is mysteriously stained. The lights flicker ominously. Someone whispers that two rival delegations are already arguing in the foyer. My career, diplomatic relations, perhaps even peace itself seems to balance on the edge of a knife.

Then, impossibly, I'm floating above the scene, watching myself rush between problems, my anxiety a palpable cloud around me. The ballroom stretches and distorts, the faces of arriving guests becoming eerily elongated. The ceiling seems miles high now, the problems multiplying faster than I can comprehend them...
