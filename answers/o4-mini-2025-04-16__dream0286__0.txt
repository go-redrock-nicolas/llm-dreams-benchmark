I am dreaming. You blink into a liquid sky, where clouds ripple like silk and refract the light into dancing prisms. You are dreaming, yet every sensation feels intensely real—each heartbeat a drum in your chest, each breath a swirl of stardust. Around you stand a circle of figures: strangers in shifting guises, their faces blurred by moonlight, their eyes fixed on you. When you hesitate—unsure what path to lead them down—they bow their heads as though your next word will shape the very ground beneath their feet.

Confronting this unexpected authority, your pulse flutters. A cool wind snakes through the clearing, carrying the scent of jasmine and cedar. The murmurs of the crowd hush into expectant silence. You search the horizon and see two divergent roads: one paved with pale, luminescent stones that cradle glowing flowers; the other a winding ribbon of mirrored obsidian that swallows your reflection whole. Your uncertainty mounts, but the onlookers press in, leaning forward as though their balance depends on your choice.

Steeling yourself, you inhale deeply and visualize both paths alive with possibility. You speak in a calm voice that surprises your own ears, “Follow me into the light, where new beginnings blossom,” you say, nodding toward the stone road. Immediately, the petals unfurl in tears of soft moonlight, and the ground hums with a gentle vibration, as if gratitude has awakened. Your followers straighten, their shadows lengthening behind them like loyal companions.

As you step forward, the lilies at your feet shimmer and bloom with every footfall. The air grows warmer and richer. You realize that in this dreamscape, your voice carries the power to transform uncertainty into creation. With each confident stride, the sky above ripples anew, and a cascade of silver feathers drifts down, dusting your hair. You are both architect and guide, forging a trail through the unknown—an authority born from the deepest wonder of your own dreaming mind.
