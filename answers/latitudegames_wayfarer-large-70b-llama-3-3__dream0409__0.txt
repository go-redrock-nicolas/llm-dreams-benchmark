I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a desolate, moonlit landscape - endless dunes of golden sand roll out to the horizon, studded with strange, glowing plants that pulse softly in the lunar light. The air is heavy with the sweet-sweet scent of jukka flowers, their intoxicating perfume threatening to pull me under.

As I wade through the warm sand, I notice a figure in the distance - a woman with skin like polished obsidian, wearing flowing silks that catch the moonlight. She's shouting something, but her voice is carried away by the desert wind. Compelled by curiosity, I start to run towards her.

But as I draw closer, I realize with growing horror that my feet are sinking into the sand... and it's not just inert desert grit. The ground beneath me writhes and darkens, revealing chitinous limbs and twisted, alien eyes.
