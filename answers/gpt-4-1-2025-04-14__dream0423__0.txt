I am dreaming. I find myself adrift in a surreal, ever-shifting landscape—a place where colors drip from the sky and the ground pulses beneath my feet like the heartbeat of an enormous, invisible creature. The air shimmers with secrets.

In this dream, I am not alone. Ahead, across a winding river of liquid glass, stands someone I deeply care for. Their face is made of fragments—pieces of smiles and side-glances, soft laughter and tangled silences. The river between us is crossed by a path of floating stones, each etched with words: TRUST, DOUBT, LOVE, FEAR.

With every hesitant step toward them, the world responds. Shadows ripple under the stones, some shaped like comforting hands, others like subtle, whispering vines that curl around my ankles, urging caution. I remember the countless small exchanges—the times laughter came with a question mark, the way their words sometimes shifted slightly, invisible currents nudging my emotions.

I finally reach the other side, the air thick with the scent of rain and the ink of secrets unsaid. My companion looks at me, eyes swirling with both affection and something less clear—a mosaic of genuine feeling and veiled intent. I feel the weight of manipulation, soft as silk but tightening, as if the very environment conspires to keep me unsure.

Gathering all the clarity my dream-self can muster, I extend my hands, palms open, and a soft, glowing light pulses in my chest. Words tumble out—gentle, honest, like the ringing of chimes:

“I feel the currents between us. Sometimes, I sense the edges of your words, currents I cannot read. It makes me wonder if my heart is moving by its own tides, or if there is a hidden wind guiding it away from its true course.”

As I speak, the fragments of my companion’s face shift and settle, forming a truer expression, unguarded and raw. Rain begins to fall, warm and electric, washing away the vines and dissipating the uneasy shadows. The ground steadies beneath us.

In this lucid moment, I understand that surfacing these dynamics, even in a dream, allows both of us to stand in the open. The manipulation, given a name and voice, loses its silent power. The world around us brightens, colors rising bold and clear—ripe for something real and honest to grow.

I wake, heart racing, carrying with me the conviction that even in waking life, the courage to speak gently but bravely can transform the most shadowed of relationships, lighting a path toward trust and genuine connection.
