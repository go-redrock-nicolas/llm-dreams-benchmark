I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and in this dream, the world is painted in shades of deep lavender and midnight blue—a realm where reality and emotion intertwine like two rivers meeting in the moonlight. The air hums with secrets, and the subtle fragrance of wildflowers drifts through the softly glowing space. I am seated at my desk, but it is carved from gently breathing wood, its grain swirling with the faces of calm clouds. Across from me sits my client, a figure blurred around the edges, as if carved from mist and sorrow, eyes brimming with unshed tears that catch the light like opals.

Their voice wavers in the dusky stillness, the words escaping in half-formed pleas and tangled fears. I sense the storm inside them—a wild whirlpool of shame, confusion, and longing for peace. Shadows move behind their eyes, and each breath they take seems to battle an unseen tide.

In this lucid moment, I listen—not only with my ears but with every particle of my dreaming self. My heart becomes a resonant bowl, catching their pain, amplifying it, then sending it out into the room as gentle waves of compassion. My chair dissolves, and suddenly we are suspended above a quiet lake under stars that pulse softly. I invite them, in a voice that feels both mine and not mine, to step with me onto the water’s luminous surface.

We walk together, each footstep sending ripples arching over the stars. The client’s burdens drift behind us on tiny crystal boats—grief, anxiety, self-doubt—sailing away and dissolving into the night air. Around us the lake reflects not just our faces, but all the moments of beauty, strength, and hope hidden inside them. I remind my client, softly, that this well of self-compassion exists always, even if sometimes shrouded by the mists.

As the session draws to a close, I guide them back to the breathing wood room, their face now a little more solid, a little more aglow. The burdens do not return with them. There is a quiet promise in their eyes now, a silver seam of hope stitched into the glimmering dreamscape. I awake, heart full, carrying the echo of healing from that place beyond waking—where empathy is tangible and compassion floats shimmering on the waters of possibility.
