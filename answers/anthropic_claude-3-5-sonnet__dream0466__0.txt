I am dreaming. ....

I find myself walking through an ever-shifting corridor where the walls pulse with a gentle, bioluminescent glow - sometimes aquamarine, sometimes deep violet. Each step I take feels both weightless and leaden, as if I'm moving through honey while simultaneously floating. The air has a peculiar thickness to it, carrying whispers of conversations I've had throughout my life, some familiar and others just beyond recognition.

Ahead of me, doorways continually materialize and dissolve, each one crafted from different materials - one made of swirling autumn leaves, another of crystalline ice, and yet another seeming to be woven from strands of starlight. I recognize these as portals to different chapters of my life, times when I've faced similar crossroads.

Through one door, I catch glimpses of my younger self navigating the first day at a new school, the anxiety and excitement intertwined like twin serpents. Through another, I see myself moving to a new city, surrounded by towers of unopened boxes and unfamiliar shadows.

But something is different now. The current transition feels more profound, more consequential. The corridor begins to narrow, and the bioluminescent walls pulse faster, their light becoming more intense. I feel a pressure building, not uncomfortable but insistent, like the moment before a thunderstorm breaks.

Suddenly, the floor beneath me transforms into a mirror, and I see not just my reflection but countless versions of myself - some from the past, some from possible futures. They all move in synchronized motion, reaching out toward something just beyond view. The air fills with a harmonious humming, and I realize it's the sound of all these versions of myself breathing in unison.

The dream shifts, and now I'm standing in a vast garden where the plants grow in impossible colors - blues deeper than ocean trenches, reds brighter than dying stars. Each flower represents a lesson learned from past transitions, blooming and withering in rapid succession, their petals carrying written wisdom that dissolves into glittering dust as I try to read them.

I understand, in that peculiar way that dream-logic works, that this garden is growing inside me, that each previous change has planted seeds that are only now beginning to sprout. The challenge isn't in starting over - it's in recognizing that I've never truly started over at all. Each transition has been a continuation, a building upon what came before.

The dream begins to fade, but not before I notice something crucial: my shadow on the ground isn't a mere silhouette, but a vibrant tapestry woven from all my past experiences, casting not darkness but a rainbow of possibilities ahead of me.

As I begin to wake, the garden, the corridor, and all its doors merge into a single point of light that settles somewhere behind my ribs, a compass pointing toward understanding that this new transition, like all the others, isn't an ending but a metamorphosis.

The dream dissolves, leaving behind an impression of infinite doorways and gardens yet to grow...
