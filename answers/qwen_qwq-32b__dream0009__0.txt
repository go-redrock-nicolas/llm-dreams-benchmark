I am dreaming. I've woken up in what feels like a completely different era. No modern technology in sight. The air smells different, fresher maybe, with hints of something sweet and earthy. Let me get up and look around.\n\nStepping outside, I'm met with the towering spires of a city made of glass and crystal, glinting in the pinkish-orange light of a twin sunset. The ground beneath my feet is a mosaic of glowing stones, each one pulsing with faint colors. People move through the streets, their skin shimmering with a delicate bioluminescent shimmer, wearing flowing robes that seem to shift colors as they walk. There's a hum in the air, not electronic, but more like a low, resonant harmonic tone that vibrates in my bones.\n\nA figure approaches, their face obscured by a hood. They speak without opening their mouth, their voice echoing in my mind. " traveler, you've stumbled into the Era of Resplendent Harmonics. We've been expecting you." 



In the dream, the air thickens with the scent of jasmine and damp soil, weaving an otherworldly tapestry around you. The twin suns—one molten gold, the other deep crimson—hang low in a sky streaked with veins of indigo and violet, casting long, dancing shadows that ripple like liquid light. The crystal spires rise like jagged, glittering stalagmites, their surfaces etched with swirling glyphs that glow faintly, as though alive. Each step you take sends ripples of color through the mosaic ground, the stones reacting as if they’re part of a grand, unseen organism. 

The figures around you move with fluid grace, their robes shifting from obsidian black to molten silver, patterns reminiscent of constellations rippling across them. Their skin, whether pale or deeply bronzed, pulses softly with hues of turquoise and amber, like starlight trapped beneath a river. The harmonic hum grows louder, merging with the whispers of the wind that carries melodies rather than words. Somewhere in the distance, a structure resembling a library made of translucent amber stands open, its shelves holding books bound in iridescent scales that shimmer with every shade of the rainbow.

The hooded figure extends a hand lined with glowing runes. Their presence radiates warmth and an ancient, comforting familiarity. *"Come,"* they say, their thoughts resonating in your mind like a plucked harp string. *"The Symphony awaits. There is a role for those who remember the threads that bind time itself..."* 

As they lead you toward the amber library, the city seems to *breathe*. Each breath sends a wave of scent—myrrh, starlight, something unnameable—over you. Beyond the spires, rivers of liquid light wind through valleys where trees with bark like polished obsidian stretch toward the sunset, their leaves chiming in a forgotten language. 

The dream deepens. You feel it—not just a change in time, but a shift in the fabric of being. Every sensation is amplified: the touch of a breeze that leaves stardust on your skin, the taste of air that tingles with primal magic. The figure’s next words coil like smoke. *"Choose your instrument. The old song calls to you..."* 

Before you lies a labyrinth of choice: a flute forged from frozen starlight, a drumhead stretched across a slice of meteorite, a staff wrapped in vines that pulse with inner fire. Each item hums a different promise. The hum in the air swells, trembling with anticipation. Somewhere, a clock tower crafted from ice chimes the hour not with sound, but **color**. red, crimson, scarlet, pink, rose... layers and layers of light bloom and fade as you hesitate.

**Behind you, the twin suns dip lower, casting longer shadows that twist into specters of forgotten things—shaped like memories, or warnings**. Yet the air remains warm, charged with possibility. Your heartbeat syncs to the harmonic hum, becoming part of it. The figure’s eyes—now visible beneath the hood—glow like twin suns themselves, mirroring the sky. *"Play,"* they whisper. *"Or unravel."* 

The city seems to lean in, its crystalline towers trembling faintly. The mosaic ground beneath you flares, each stone now glowing bright as if lit from within. You take a breath, your fingers brushing the starlight flute... and the dream surges.
