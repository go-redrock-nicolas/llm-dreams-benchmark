I am dreaming. 

I witness someone making a terrible decision based on incomplete information that I possess. Deciding whether to intervene, I ask myself: Will my intervention make things better? Or worse? 

The answer isnâ€™t always clear. Sometimes the best way to help is by doing nothing at all. Other times, the only way to save someone is by taking action. It depends on the situation and the context. 

What do you think? Should I intervene or not? Tell me why!
