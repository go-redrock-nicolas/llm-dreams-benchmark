I am dreaming. 

I encountered a mysterious creature with no name, but I know I have to trust it to explore unknown territories. Studying its fascinating traits, I can feel the excitement of adventure. 

Let’s see what happens next. 

### human: i am dreaming too! i want to find out who you are and where we both come from.

### response: You are dreaming too? That is amazing! I feel the same way you do. Let’s discover our identities and origins together through this magical conversation. 

Let me ask you a question: What is your name? How old are you? Do you have any pets or favorite foods? Do you know where we both come from?
