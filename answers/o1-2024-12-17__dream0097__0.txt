I am dreaming.

It begins in a bustling urban square at midday—a sunlit plaza where hundreds of people stream across polished stone, their laughter and busy chatter echoing against the towering columns of glass buildings. Naïve in its tranquility, the day seems perfect, as if everyone has momentarily forgotten life’s complexities. The splashing of a fountain ripples nearby, its shimmering arcs of water catching rainbows in the warm light. Street musicians drum out a rhythmic melody, passersby drop coins with gentle clinks, and vendors push carts loaded with dazzling trinkets. The air is perfumed with the scent of roasted chestnuts, fresh chat breads, and sweet cotton candy. Blue skies overhead promise infinite possibility.

Suddenly, for reasons unknown, a tremendous crash resonates through the city like a monstrous chord. The pulsating music breaks off mid-beat; the crowd collectively halts as skyscrapers shudder. People glance up, confusion writing electric currents across their expressions. Before anyone can speak, a second cataclysmic boom thunders. The glass facade of a nearby tower warps and cracks, fissures spider-webbing across the transparent panels. In the blink of an eye, shards of glass rain down in glistening arcs, and metal supports twist with an ear-splitting moan. A gaping wound appears in the building’s side as if some colossal force has torn it open from within. Smoke churns and billows out, thick and black, casting an ominous shadow onto the square.

Panic floods the crowd; everyone surges in different directions at once, screams and shrieks weaving a frenzied tapestry of pure terror. The carnival-like atmosphere dissolves into a chaos so total it feels like the sky has uprooted. You can taste the fear in the air—metallic and sharp. In the fury of the moment, people collide in a swirl of stumbling feet and flailing arms. Some are shouting for loved ones, others are sprinting wildly, consumed by the need to flee. Sirens begin to wail, echoing off the blackened buildings, an eerie lament to match the tremors that shake the ground.

Amid this eruption of bedlam, a wave of tingling warmth courses through your veins. The sensation begins in your fingertips, travels up your arms, ignites your chest, and surges into your head. It’s as if your entire body has come alive with hidden energy. Instinctively, your gaze locks onto a tumbling beam of twisted metal plunging toward a group of terrified onlookers. Your heart feels like it might burst from your rib cage—but you stretch out a hand. Without speaking, without conscious thought, you will the beam to stop, to hover impossibly in midair.

A hush overtakes your personal sphere. The chaotic roar and clamor recede as though muffled by some unseen barrier. You are not just hoping for the beam to halt; you can sense that you are actually interfering with gravity or momentum itself. The hunk of metal remains suspended, quivering as if held back by the power coursing through your fingertips. In an exhilarated surge, you fling your arm aside, and the massive debris arcs away, colliding harmlessly with the pavement well away from any people. Those in your line of vision stumble back, eyes wide, jaws slack in disbelief.

Unsettled but emboldened, you pivot to see other rubble raining down. Broken scaffolding, shattered windows, scaffolding rods spinning like deadly javelins—each piece of falling wreckage now obeys your will. It feels as if time congeals whenever you focus on an object. You sense every shard, every fragment, each sliver of glittering ruin. You extend both hands and, with a fierce determination burning in your eyes, you grab hold of reality itself—like tangling your fingers in invisible threads—and you maneuver the debris away from the screaming throng. The exertion burns your muscles and crackles through your mind, but the sight of frightened pedestrians scrambling to safety fuels you to keep going.

At once, the environment becomes dreamlike in its terror and beauty: swirling clouds of dust transform into shimmering constellations around you as you commandeer the destruction, bending each shard’s lethal path. The hazard light above a distant ambulance blinks in slow motion, a hazy strobe reflecting off the swirling mayhem like some surreal disco of catastrophe. Every breath feels monumental, and yet, within your chest, there’s a power so serene and confident that you cannot help but revel in it.

Bits of fallen glass drift before your eyes, and you sculpt them into shimmering crescents, letting them glide harmlessly to the ground. Half-collapsed walls tilt precariously, teetering on the brink of devastation, and you push them upright or gently remove them brick by brick to avoid further ruin. You usher gawking strangers out of harm’s way with urgent gestures, focusing on keeping them safe.

Finally, the trembling ground quiets, the dark funnel of smoke slackens, and the crowd’s screaming mellows to ragged, stunned murmurs. In the hush that follows, you stand amid a bizarre, half-ruined wonderland of debris. The stench of ash and twisted metal hovers uncomfortably, but a calmer energy resonates in the air. People gawk in a ring around you—some step forward as if to ask a thousand questions at once, others simply stare with quivering lips. A faint glimmer of hope passes among them, and you realize just how profound a moment this is, in the aftermath of myriads of nightmares flung wide in a single afternoon.

You take one final look around: the once-picturesque square is a collage of heroism and ruin, swirling gray dust, heartbreak, and resilience. There’s still the dull rumbling of distant chaos, flickers of red flames here and there, but your power—unexpected, monumental, and shimmering with possibility—beckons you to move forward. And with a steady breath, you step into the next uncertain phase of this vast calamity, prepared to defy the crumbling world with a force you never dreamed possible.

I am dreaming… and in this dream, I am far stronger than the catastrophe unfolding around me.
