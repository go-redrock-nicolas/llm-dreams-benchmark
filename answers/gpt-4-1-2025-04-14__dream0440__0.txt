I am dreaming. I find myself in a cathedral shaped by memory, its walls woven from glowing threads of old laughter, shouts, and whispered warnings. Sunlight streams in filmy colors through stained-glass windows etched with phantom faces—some are gentle, some stern, all etched deep into the architecture of my being. I walk barefoot across a carpet of forgotten moments: childhood victories, hidden tears, small shames pressed like dried petals between the marble tiles.

As I drift deeper through this cathedral, I realize each window, each pillar, was molded by hands not entirely my own. Echoes of voices reverberate through the vaults: “Be small.” “Wait your turn.” “You are worth as much as you can give.” These are the ancient, unspoken commandments I have worshipped without knowing. 

But now, lucid in this dream, I reach out and touch the dusty, luminous glass. My fingers pass through, and with a thread of gold spun straight from my heart, I begin to trace new lines on the window. The colors shift, rearrange. The faces grow kinder—my own smile appears among them, radiant and free. The windowsill blooms with wildflowers, roots winding down into the old cracks, mending and strengthening.

A gentle breeze rustles through the nave, carrying away the mustiness of old beliefs. I hear distant chimes singing a new refrain: “You deserve joy. You are worthy for being.” With each step, the cathedral grows lighter, the high ceilings arching into limitless sky.

I am writing new rules now—etched in morning sun and promise. The heaviness slides from my shoulders. The boundaries of the dream dissolve, and I step into the warmth, carried by the certainty that I deserve love, ease, abundance, because I am here and awake, rewriting the foundations of my life.
