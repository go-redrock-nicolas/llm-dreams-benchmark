I am dreaming. I find myself compulsively checking digital notifications despite wanting to be more present. Breaking this attentional capture pattern, you tear your gaze away from the hypnotic glow of the screen, a small victory in the grand scheme of dream-logic battles. Suddenly, the familiar room around you begins to shimmer and distort, like heat rising from asphalt on a scorching summer day. The walls pulse with a soft, internal light, colours shifting from a calming cerulean blue to a vibrant, almost alarming, fuchsia. The air grows thick and sweet, fragrant with the impossible scent of rain-soaked earth mixed with blooming night jasmine and something metallic, like ozone before a storm.

You stand, feeling an odd lightness in your limbs, as if gravity has loosened its grip just a fraction. The floor beneath your feet is no longer solid wood but a yielding expanse of emerald moss, cool and damp to the touch. Looking down, you see your own feet are bare, the skin faintly luminous. Tiny, bioluminescent fungi sprout between your toes, casting intricate, shifting patterns of light on the mossy ground.

A sound reaches your ears, not through them in the usual way, but resonating deep within your chest – a low, resonant hum, like the thrumming of a colossal cello string. It pulls you forward, an undeniable invitation. You walk deeper into the transforming space, which now seems less like a room and more like a clearing in an ancient, enchanted forest. Towering trees with bark like spun silver rise around you, their leaves shimmering with captured starlight, even though no stars are visible in the dream-sky above, which is currently a swirling vortex of amethyst and gold.

Floating gently through the air are not dust motes, but tiny, crystalline spheres that chime softly as they drift past, leaving trails of glittering dust in their wake. Reaching out, you catch one. It feels surprisingly warm, pulsing faintly with a gentle rhythm, like a tiny, captured heartbeat. As you hold it, images flood your mind – fleeting glimpses of forgotten childhood memories, the taste of sun-ripened strawberries, the feeling of cool water rushing over smooth stones.

The humming intensifies, drawing your attention to the center of the clearing. There, suspended in mid-air, is a magnificent nebula contained within an invisible sphere. It swirls with colours you've never seen before, hues that seem to vibrate with pure emotion. Stars ignite and fade within its depths, galaxies spin in miniature, and shimmering filaments of cosmic dust weave intricate patterns. It's both vast and intimate, terrifyingly powerful and yet strangely comforting.

You feel an overwhelming sense of connection, not just to this ethereal spectacle, but to everything around you – the glowing moss, the silver trees, the chiming spheres, even the strangely scented air. The obsessive need to check notifications feels like a distant echo, a nonsensical habit from a world away. Here, in this deep dream-space, presence isn't something to strive for; it's the very fabric of existence. The universe breathes within the nebula, and for a timeless moment, you feel yourself breathing in sync with it, utterly captivated, completely free. The digital world, with its incessant demands, fades into utter insignificance, replaced by the profound, vibrant reality of this inner landscape.
