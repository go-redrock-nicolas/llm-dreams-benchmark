I am dreaming. I'm standing on the edge of a lush, verdant valley, surrounded by towering trees that stretch towards the sky like giant pillars. The air is alive with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the gentle breeze carries the soft chirping of birds. I feel a sense of calm wash over me, a serenity that belies the butterflies in my stomach.

I remember the feeling of dread that had gripped me just moments before, as I recalled the humiliating failure that had befallen me all those years ago. The memories of my face burning with shame, of my hands shaking with anxiety, and of the Classroom erupting into cheers and jeers still echoed in my mind. And yet, I feel a newfound determination rising up within me, as if the memories of disappointment have ignited a fire that fuels my resolve.

As I take a deep breath, I feel the atmosphere of the valley transform before me. The sky shifts to a brilliant azure, with puffy white clouds drifting lazily across it. The trees begin to sway in time with a gentle melody, their leaves rustling softly against each other like a chorus of whispering spirits. A soft, ethereal light permeates the air, illuminating everything it touches with an otherworldly glow.

Suddenly, the figure approaches me, a guardian angel-like being with wings spread wide, radiating a warm, golden light. It speaks to me in a voice that is both soothing and commanding:

"How many times must you confront your fears, brave one?" Its words echo within my mind, stirring the depths of my soul.

I respond with a resolute determination, my voice steady and strong, "I will not falter. I will conquer."

With renewed fervor, I take a deep breath, and prepare to face the challenge once more. As I do, the valley begins to shift and change, the ground beneath my feet giving way to a sparkly terrain that radiates Gemini-like intensity. The air thickens with an electric charge, like thunder before a fierce storm, carrying with it an essence that is both frightening and exhilarating.

I recall the previous failure vividly, feeling the thrill of fear coursing through my veins. However, this time around, I realize that familiarity breeds desire for dominance. I recall the exact sensations of those nerves coursing through me as I looked out at the judging faces of my indifferent audience. Yet this realization flips the script on me from perhaps "Who am I?", transforming it into a mission-founded determination, propelling me to eliminate doubts, exceeding even my fantasized self-image.
