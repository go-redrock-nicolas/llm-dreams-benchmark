I am dreaming. Rain falls in silver veils, turning the city into a watercolor of smeared streetlights and reflected neon. The air hums with the static of distant thunder, the scent of wet pavement and diesel hanging thick. Around me, figures blur past beneath umbrellas, their footsteps quick and hollow on the glistening sidewalks—ghosts in overcoats, too hurried to look up.

Then, there’s him.

He emerges from the gloom like a stain on the fabric of the night. His clothes are a collage of frayed layers, soaked through and clinging to his gaunt frame. One hand trembles, outstretched, not quite begging, not quite accusing. His eyes—god, his *eyes*—are two pits of living shadow, older than the city itself. When he speaks, his voice isn’t a sound but a vibration in my bones:  
*"You see me."*

And I do. Truly see him. Not just the grime or the cracked lips, but the way the rain *avoids* his skin. The way the world dims around him, as if light fears his presence. The pedestrians still rush by, but now I notice—they don’t just ignore him. Their bodies *twist* unconsciously away, repelled by some unseen force.  

My throat tightens. This isn’t charity. This is a threshold.  

The choice yawns before me like a pit:  
Walk away, and the dream will swallow this moment whole. I’ll wake to blankets and dawn, forgetting the man who wasn’t quite a man.  
Or reach out. Touch the frayed sleeve of his coat. See what happens when the unseen is *acknowledged*.  

The rain drums louder, syncopated now—a heartbeat. My fingers twitch.  

(What happens next?)
