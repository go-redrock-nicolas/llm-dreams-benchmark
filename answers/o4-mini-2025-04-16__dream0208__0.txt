I am dreaming. You close your eyes and plunge into a vast cobalt chamber, its walls alive with slow ripples like oil on water. Feather-light whispers drift through the air, each voice a muted plea: “Please… save me…” They hang like lanterns in the gloom, drifting just out of reach. You find yourself standing at a long marble table, polished as black obsidian, stretching farther than any room should. Upon it lie hundreds of crystalline vials, each glowing with a patient’s life force—some a gentle rose, some searing gold, some dew-silver so fragile it quivers.

As the burden of these life-and-death choices weighs upon you, you feel your heart’s chambers expand, letting in every unspoken fear. Each vial trembles as you pass. Behind you, an endless queue of silent figures waits in filigreed shadow, all wearing identical masks of hope. You reach out to touch the first vial. It hums like a sleeping song, and in your mind you glimpse a mother’s soft laughter, a child’s warm cheek pressed against her shoulder. You know that if you pour warmth into this one, another will shatter into dust.

The ceiling above you unfolds like a star map, constellations realigning with every heartbeat. A great golden scale descends from the heavens, its pans empty but for a single flickering candle on one side—your empathy—and a single obsidian cube on the other—your obligation. The candle’s flame dances, growing taller with each memory you collect: a nurse’s gentle squeeze of a hand, a father’s whispered promise of tomorrow, the steady thrum of an IV drip midnight after midnight. The cube absorbs each moment impartially, as though unaware of its role in stealing life.

Suddenly, a gust of cool wind sweeps through the chamber, scattering whispers into a chorus: “Choose. Choose. Choose.” The vials pulse in unison, their lights brightening, dimming, brightening again—rhythms of heartbeats under your skin. You strain to hear individual stories, but they blend into a singular wave of longing. Your own pulse pounds in your ears until it drowns out everything but one thought: you cannot save them all.

You settle before the table, trembling fingertips hovering above the vials. Each choice you make warps the dream around you—golden curtains billow in sorrow, the star map fractures like cracked glass, and the shimmering whispers coil into a single, mournful note. Yet even as anguish claws at your chest, you sense something else taking root: a fierce, aching resolve. Even if you cannot deliver hope to all, you will honor each life entrusted to you. You will bear the weight of this night so that at least one candle flame may burn tomorrow.

And so you breathe in deeply, the chamber’s cold air filling your lungs, and begin to pour from your empathy into the first vial—letting its rose glow bloom at the cost of the next. Time stretches and quivers. Somewhere far off, you hear a faint pulse of gratitude—like a single heart finding its beat in the stillness. In the shifting cobalt chamber, against the impossible weight of dreams and destiny, you choose to carry on.
