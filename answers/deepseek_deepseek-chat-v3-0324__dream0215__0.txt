I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of ozone and melted metal, the ground beneath my feet cracked and groaning, as though the very earth resists my presence. Towers of impossible geometry rise before me, their spires twisting like shadows stretched long by a dying sun. Each one is a monument to my stubbornness, my refusal to yield—every brick laid by my hands, every beam forged in the furnace of my will.  

And yet, the city I’ve built is collapsing.  

Not from outside force, not from some grand calamity—*no*. The structures crumple inward, as though they were *always* meant to fall, as though my defiance itself was the flaw in the foundation. The harder I fight to hold them together, the faster they dissolve—into sand, into smoke, into echoes of wasted effort.  

Then I see *her*. Or perhaps *it*. A figure woven from starlight and silence, standing at the edge of the ruin. No face, yet I know it watches me. No voice, yet the weight of its presence is a whisper against my bones:  

*"You cannot keep what you refuse to release."*  

And I *know*.  

The city was never my victory. The fight was never the point. Every brick, every scar, every sleepless night—they were **anchors**, not achievements. To win, I must let them all crumble.  

My hands shake. My breath rasps.  

But I open them anyway.  

And as the last tower falls—as the weight I’ve carried unravels into the wind—I wake.  

Not to darkness.  

But to sky.
