I am dreaming. float on the cerulean surface of an endless midnight sea—each swell and ripple reflecting a tangled tapestry of memories, both achingly familiar and eerily distorted by the haze of slumber. Above, the constellations burn brighter than any reality I've ever known, their ancient patterns dancing with whispered significance. Each star seems to draw out a fragment of the past, memories swirling up like phosphorescent jellyfish from the ocean’s depth.

First comes the memory of a childhood garden—fragile sunlight slanting through willow branches, the scent of crushed grass on my fingertips. Laughter echoes, rolling endlessly, but the faces of those I love dissolve like mist when I reach out for them. My mind tugs at the scene, desperate to hold on, but the dream pushes me onward, ever deeper.

Suddenly, I find myself wandering through a labyrinthine library, its winding corridors lined with books that glow faintly, as if lit from within by secrets too precious for waking life. My hand brushes a spine and the sensation spirals through me: the book opens by itself, revealing scenes from every moment I've ever forgotten. There is a strange comfort in the melancholic sweetness of these lost details. The scent of rain on pavement, the sound of a distant train at night, the shivering anticipation of a thunderstorm as a child.

As I press onward, echoes of recurring thoughts begin to emerge, coalescing into patterns—fears and hopes and unspoken wishes weaving through the dream like silver threads. I begin to realize these are more than mere memories; they are maps, guides through the hidden topography of my subconscious. Every turn in the labyrinth, every star above, every luminescent book is an invitation to delve deeper—to confront the truths I hide from the daylight, and perhaps, if I am brave, to find understanding in the shadows.

And so I continue, drifting deeper, following these shimmering patterns as they spiral down into the heart of myself, into realms where waking reason falters, and only the vibrant, unrestrained language of dreams can show me who I truly am.
