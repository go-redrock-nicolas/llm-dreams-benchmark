I am dreaming. You, a linguist and historian, have dedicated your life to unpacking the enigmatic language known as "Sidhean," believed to be spoken by the mythical Faerie folk. It's always been a subject of fascination, ridicule, and a source of pride for your resilient family line, who've nurtured its study for generations. The whispers of Sidhean, you've come to understand, were the echoes of your ancestors' resilience, resonating through time like a haunting lullaby.

One night, under the silver glow of a full moon, you dream that you're standing in your dusty, bookshelf-lined study. The air is heavy with the scent of aged parchment and beeswax candles. Suddenly, the windowpanes rattle violently, and an ethereal wind blows through the room, scattering pages and extinguishing your candle. A tiny, glowing figure appears, floating just above your desk. It's not transparently fey, but rather, a shimmering creature ofWhat you've always known as Sidhean isn't a language at all. It's a cryptic code, designed to hide an uncomfortable truth. The glowing figure, a records keeper from a realm beyond yours, confirms this with a sad nod. They explain that your ancestors,

illo intense meet with the fae. Its eyes are like twin moons, expressive and wise. It speaks in a trill that's almost musical, the language tumbling out like a river of syllables that you somehow understand.

"You've been deceived," it says, "Sidhean isn't a language. It's a secret."

Your heart pounds as you try to grasp the enormity of this revelation. You feel a pang of betrayal, but also a spark of curiosity. The creature continues, "Your ancestors weren't communicating with the fairies; they were shielding themselves from a past they didn't wish to remember."

The room spins, and you reach out to steady yourself on your desk. The records keeper's voice becomes urgent, "They were a people torn from their home, forced into hiding. Sidhean wasn't their language; it was a disguise, a way to blend in, to survive. They did this, not just for themselves, but for their descendants, so that you too would not be found."

You shake your head, trying to rid yourself of the dream, but the creature presses on, "You must understand, this wasn't out of cowardice, but love. Love for the family they had, and the one they would leave behind."

Sobs threaten to escape you, but the records keeper gently places a tiny, translucent hand on yours. "Don't mourn the truth, embrace it. You're free now, free to forge your own path, to decide who you want to be."

With those words, the creature fades, leaving you alone in the now-quiet room. You look out the window and see that the moon has begun to set. As dawn breaks, you wake up, your heart pounding, your mind racing. The dream was vivid, so real. You can still feel the touch of the creature on your hand. You know that your life will never be the same, but you also know that you're ready to face whatever lies ahead. And so, you get out of bed, determined to unravel the new truths that await you, one sunlit step at a time. The future is unknown, but you are ready, filled with a renewed sense of purpose and a deepened love for your family's resilience. After all, you now hold the gift of knowledge, and the freedom that comes with it.
