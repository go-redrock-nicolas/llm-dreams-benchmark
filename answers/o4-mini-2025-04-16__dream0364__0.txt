I am dreaming. I drift through a silent train station at dawn: the platforms long since emptied of passengers, the rails rusted into rippling folds of copper and ochre. As I walk, each rivet in the overhead canopy pulses softly, as if breathing. A single droplet of morning dew clings to a spider’s thread, suspended by a single filament over a cracked mosaic tile. No one else would notice it, but to me it glows like a miniature moon—liquid pearl refracting the pale sunrise into a thousand shifting rainbows.

I crouch to study it. Within that droplet, I see whole forests trembling on the brink of spring, tiny birds warming their wings in golden light, and streams carving silver veins through emerald hills. The world, contained in this sliver of water, is more alive and vivid than any panorama I’ve ever witnessed. I reach out, and as my fingertip brushes its surface, the droplet expands, and I’m drawn inside—suspended mid-air, weightless, drifting through a cathedral of mint-green leaves and latticed branches.

Around me, every ordinary object is reborn: a fallen leaf becomes stained glass shot through with veins of warm amber; a bent bicycle wheel suspends itself in mid-rotation, each spoke shimmering like spun starlight. From the rusted bench nearby, soft music emanates—notes of wind chimes twisted by decades of weather, now refined into a delicate, haunting melody. I close my eyes and hear the invisible orchestra of creaking iron, breathing wood, skittering mice, and the soft sigh of morning mist rolling in from the mountains.

Appreciating this hidden wonder in the mundane, I lean back against that old bench. Its wood grain threads swirl beneath my hand, patterns of galaxies unfurling in knot and groove. I realize that every crack in the pavement, every speck of dust in the sunlight, every forgotten hinge is a doorway into worlds I’ve yet to explore. And in that realization, I feel both infinitely small and boundlessly expansive, as though the universe itself were pulsing just beneath my skin—and I, in my dream, have finally learned to see.
