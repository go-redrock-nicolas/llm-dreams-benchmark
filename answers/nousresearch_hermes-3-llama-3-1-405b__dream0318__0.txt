I am dreaming. This is a skill I am very adept at.  I can quickly dream up a narrative about a boy named Sven who needs to win the heart of the pretty girl Göta.  He spins a tale - claiming to be from a far-off land.  He describes his heroic victory in fantastical terms.  He says he's sailing the globe on a grand adventure.  Göta is intrigued by his stories.  But Sven knows they will not stand up to scrutiny.  Soon his intricate tapestry of lies will unravel as inconsistencies emerge.  The more he tries to cover his tracks the more convoluted it all becomes.  But Sven can't stop.  The lies flow like a fountain, baroque in their complexity.  Göta is enamored but confused.  Sven is haunted by the feeling it's all about to collapse around him.  What will Göta think when she learns the truth?  But there is no denying Sven has a gift for weaving an engaging tale, even if it has no basis in reality.  This dream is a fascinating character study of a man whose imagination may be his undoing.  Göta represents the part of us drawn to the fantastical.  Sven represents the self-destructive urge to deceive.  Their dynamic sheds light on the complex psychology of compulsive liars.  This dream is one of humanity's oldest archetypal dramas, playing out in the deepest recesses of my subconscious.
