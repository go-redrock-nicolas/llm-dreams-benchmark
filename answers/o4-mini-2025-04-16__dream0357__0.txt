I am dreaming. I find myself drifting in a vast cavern of liquid light, each breath rippling the luminous walls like oil on water. The air hums with a low, resonant chord that seems to slip beneath my ribs and vibrate my heartbeat in time. Colors move and pulse around me—emerald green dissolving into molten gold, deep violet bleeding into fiery orange—each hue a living thing with its own gentle sigh. I realize with a sudden shiver that I stand on a floor of rippling glass, and with every step, I glimpse impossibly distant landscapes through the transparent surface: a volcano frozen in mid-eruption, a field of glass flowers opening their crystalline petals to an unseen sun, my own face reflected in dream-soft focus, eyes wide with wonder and fear.

Moments ago I escaped a thunderous collapse—ancient pillars crumbling in on themselves, stones crashing like bones. I felt the shockwave knock the breath out of me, the very ground tilting beneath my feet. Now, here, suspended in this spectral theater, I can still hear the echo of falling rock. It lingers in the hollow of my chest, reminding me that a single instant can change everything. My pulse quickens: I am alive, and yet I carry the memory of near-annihilation like a trembling bird in my chest. With every heartbeat I taste the sweetness of existence and the tang of fragility, as though life itself were both a precious wine and a blade’s edge.

As I wander, the cavern stretches toward an infinite horizon. Along one wall, a procession of translucent figures drifts by—shapes that look like me at different ages, each carrying a lantern of softly glowing ash. Some glance back with eyes full of yearning, others stare ahead, resolute, their lanterns flickering with quiet courage. I reach out, and the nearest figure pauses. Its hand is cool and weightless in mine, and I feel a gentle jolt, like reading a secret carved into bone: every life ever lived is a thread in this tapestry, and if even one thread snaps, the whole weave trembles. The realness of my own thread—tenuous, precious, irreplaceable—thrums in my palm.

Further on, the cavern gives way to a sky streaked with impossible constellations—stars that pulse in patterns like the chords of an ancient lullaby. Between them drift colossal comets whose tails trail stardust as fine as moonlight. I lift my face, letting the cosmic breeze sift through my hair. It whispers that time is an ocean without boundaries, that each moment is both an island and a wave. I taste salt in the wind, but it is not sorrow—rather, it is the bittersweet promise that every ending seeds a new beginning. And though I tremble at the enormity of it—the knowledge that this waking life, this dream, this universe could all slip away in a single breath—I also feel a fierce, incandescent joy: to be here at all is a miracle beyond all telling.

In the distance, a door of braided silver light appears, hovering like a haloed monolith. As I step toward it, the echo of my footsteps merges with the music of the spheres. The door parts without a sound, and on the other side, I sense a world yet unwritten—an unfolding canvas where days stretch open like petals, and every choice I make paints a new trace of color across the sky. In that moment, I understand that awareness of mortality is not a weight to carry but a key to unlock wonder. My chest swells with gratitude and awe as I slip through the threshold, knowing I will awaken changed, my heart alive to the fragile, fierce beauty of being.
