I am dreaming. I am performing at the International Polka Performers Contest in New York, where I have been practicing for months. I am wearing my studded shoes and my polka dress. As I step onto the stage, I see the rows of judges sitting in front of me, holding their pens and frowning. My heart starts beating faster as I realize that this is the moment of truth. I take a deep breath, and begin.

The music starts, and I move with it, feeling the rhythm in my bones. My feet tap and my skirt flares as I twirl around the stage. The audience is silent, watching me with their mouths slightly open. I forget everything else and focus on nothing but the music and my steps. Every move feels effortless, like I was born to do this. 

As I come to the final pose, I hear a gasp from the audience. I hold my breath, waiting for the judges to speak. They sit in silence for what feels like hours, until finally, the lead judge speaks.

"We have seen many talented performers today, but none like you," he says. "You are a true polka star, and we would be honored to have you represent our country at the World Polka Championship."

I feel tears in my eyes, holding back my joy.Â I am finally where I have always dreamed of being, and I am grateful to myself for all the practice and hard work that got me here.
