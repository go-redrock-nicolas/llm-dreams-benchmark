I am dreaming. In the dream, I'm standing on a vast, undulating sea of cool, soft velvet, like the luxurious fabric of the universe itself. The velvet stretches out in all directions, an infinite ocean of deep indigo and night-black hues, speckled with constellations that flicker like distant stars. The sky above is not one of Earth's familiar blues, but a mesmerizing tapestry of amethyst, obsidian, and emerald, woven with cosmic threads of light.

I am alone, or so it seems, until I notice a small, distant figure also standing on the velvet sea. Its silhouette shifts with the gentle waves of the fabric, and as I watch, it grows larger, approaching me. It's a child, a younger version of myself, eyes wide and arms wrapped around a well-loved teddy bear. The child's gaze is sheepish, apologetic, as if they're responsible for the emotional storms that have been brewing within me.

As they near, the child extends a small hand, offering me the teddy bear. "He wants to help," the child says, voice barely above a whisper. The bear's eyes gleam warm and comforting, and I feel a pull, a tug at my heart, a reminder of simpler times when comfort was easy to find.

I take the bear, and as my fingers close around its worn fur, the velvet sea beneath us begins to ripple and churn. The constellations above start to spin, their lights blurring into rivers of stardust. I feel myself being carried away on this celestial tide, drowning in the vastness of the cosmos.

Fear grips me, and I feel my compassion, my self-kindness, slipping away like sand through an hourglass. I'm adrift, alone, and the child is nowhere to be seen. Panic sets in, and I struggle against the celestial current, trying to find solid ground.

Just when I think I might be lost forever, I feel a gentle tug. A cord, invisible yet tangible, connects me to the child, now standing on an island of solid, emerald green velvet, untouched by the cosmic storm. With newfound determination, I grasp the cord and let it pull me towards the island.

Here, I find solace in the warmth of the child's embrace. We sit, surrounded by the chaos of the cosmos, and the child begins to teach me. They show me how to find the calm within the storm, how to let the cosmic tides ebb and flow without losing myself. They teach me that compassion is not a finite resource, but an infinite well, always available, always replenishing.

As I learn, the storm above begins to subside. The stars slow their dance, the rivers of stardust morph back into constellations, and the ocean of velvet lies calm once more. With each lesson, each exercise in self-compassion, the island grows larger, the child's smile broader. And I, standing on solid ground, feel my capacity for kindness and understanding grow, thriving even in the face of cosmic chaos.
