I am dreaming. I lead a group of strangers through a challenging wilderness expedition.  

We find ourselves on the edge of an ancient forest, where time seems to have folded in on itself, and every tree breathes with a soft, glowing pulse, as though they’re alive—not just with life, but with memory. The sky above is an impossible shade of violet, scattered with twin moons that hover low, casting twin shadows wherever we step. Behind us, the world we came from blurs into a swirl of mist and forgotten things, and ahead, a path weaves through a landscape stitched from forgotten myths.

Our journey begins with a bridge of black stone suspended over a canyon that whispers secrets. Each step across it carries the echo of another traveler’s story, voices speaking in languages long thought lost. When I reach the other side, I feel something shift within me. A knowing. A strange sense of self-confidence I’ve never felt before bubbles up from deep inside, like a spring hidden beneath rock and fear.

It dawns on me that I'm the one making the decisions now—choosing the route, identifying dangers, keeping the group together. Even though no one spoke of it aloud, they follow me as if it’s second nature, trusting where I lead.

I begin with hesitation, but as the dream deepens, so does the confidence coursing through my veins. I steer us through groves of crystal trees that sing when the wind passes through them, their melodies haunting and sweet. Each note hums in our bones, sharpening our senses and warming our tired limbs. I remember things not my own—maps etched in stardust, words carved in fire—guiding me with an instinct that defies all logic.

Eventually, the terrain grows more treacherous. A thundering river of liquid light begins to rise beneath an obsidian cliff we must descend, and I feel each person’s fear like a second heartbeat. They're waiting for direction, and my hands don’t shake as I expect them to. Instead, I envision a path of glowing vines curling down the cliffside like steps. As if responding to my vision, the vines harden into sturdy bridges of woven moss and sparkle.

We make our way down in silence broken only by the rhythmic humming of the cliff and the low murmur of the river far below. When the last among us reaches the bottom, I feel a pulse of gratitude from them—not spoken, but radiating from their eyes and smiles. I feel like I've awakened something within them, too, a sense of unity and purpose I hadn’t foreseen.

The journey ends at a cavern whose walls shimmer with ancient runes. Inside the cavern, the air stirs as if something immense slumbers within its darkness, the runes whispering promises of worlds yet to be. I turn to the group and propose we step forward together, knowing with certainty that whatever lies beyond will challenge us beyond what we imagine, but it will also gift us something irreplaceable.

And as we take our first step into the cavern’s embrace, the runes flare to life, illuminating our faces, our hearts, and the strange sense of belonging we’ve discovered along the way.
