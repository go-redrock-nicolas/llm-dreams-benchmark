I am dreaming. You bolt upright in bed, heart hammering as though it will burst through your ribs. A chill bead of sweat trickles down your spine, and the dim morning light in your room seems tainted by an echo of that dark realm you just fled. You can still feel the shadowy fingers of fear curling around your throat—an imprint of terror that clings to your skin like damp silk.

Throughout breakfast, every ordinary sound— the drip of coffee into the pot, the scrape of your spoon against the mug—feels menacing, amplified. You catch a glimpse of your reflection in the window and nearly gasp: your eyes are wide, rimmed in red, pupils like black voids pulling you back into the nightmare. Your hands tremble as you raise the cup, and the bitter taste of caffeine barely registers. You’re convinced that any moment the floorboards will groan, the wallpaper will peel back, and those hollow-eyed figures will emerge.

Determined to reclaim calm, you step outside and let the crisp morning air fill your lungs. A stray breeze carries the scent of damp earth and something like peppermint—but the whispering hush in the trees seems to murmur your name. You close your eyes, pressing a hand to your chest, and count each breath. Inhale: cool clarity. Exhale: fear drifting away in smoky tendrils. You recall the dream’s final image: a broken carousel spinning under a violet sky, its painted horses frozen mid-gallop, their eyes glowing with silent sorrow.

Pulling a small notebook from your jacket, you begin to sketch that carousel, line by line. With each stroke of charcoal, the oppressive weight in your chest lightens. You write words—fragments of phrases you heard: “Come home,” “Find the lost key,” “Light the lantern.” The act of creation grounds you, transforming panic into purpose. You realize this nightmare wasn’t merely a terror to flee but a puzzle, a call to something deeper within.

By midday, you find yourself at the edge of a quiet pond, its surface a flawless mirror. Leaning over, you hold a tiny lantern—all golden filaments and delicate glass—up to your reflection. The flame flickers, and your face warps into something brave and curious. In that stillness, the residual dread loosens its grip. You whisper to your reflection: “I will return. I will unlock the door.” And though the day ahead remains ordinary—traffic hum, office lights, lunch break chatter—the thread of adventure now weaves through you. The nightmare’s echo has become a map, pointing toward unexplored corridors of your own imagination, and you’re no longer afraid to follow it.
