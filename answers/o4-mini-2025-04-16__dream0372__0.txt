I am dreaming. You are dreaming. At first the world around you feels hushed, like the space between two heartbeats. You stand on a narrow, cracked ledge high above an endless desert. The sun is a distant ember, and the wind carries only dust and longing. In your hand is an empty lantern—you’ve been wandering with it turned down, convinced there’s nothing left to illuminate. Your breath is shallow; every echo of hunger seems magnified by the barren horizon.

Then, in a single, thrilling pivot of insight, you realize you’ve been operating from a place of scarcity despite having sufficient resources. The empty lantern pulses in your palm, and you sense it brimming with starlight you’ve yet to turn on. Shifting toward an abundance mindset, you breathe deeply—and in that breath, the desert turns liquid gold. The cracked ledge blossoms with wildflowers: cobalt lupines, violet foxgloves, petals humming with hum of unseen bees.

You lift the lantern, and as you do, its dull iron shifts into polished rose-gold. When you open the latch, instead of darkness, a gentle flood of light pours out, illuminating a path laid with shimmering mosaic tiles. Each tile depicts a moment when you gave more freely than you knew you could: the time you shared your smile with a stranger, the words of encouragement you offered a friend, the small kindnesses you tucked in your pocket. The more tiles you see, the more the world around you unfurls into possibility.

Ahead stands a mighty oak tree whose trunk is carved with doorways. You step through the first doorway and find yourself in a vast banquet hall. Tables groan under waterfalls of ripe fruit—apples the color of sunrise, oranges blazing like embers, grapes that catch the light like violets under moonshine. Crystal pitchers brim with water so sweet it sings on your tongue. You realize all this abundance was waiting for you: the nourishment, the creativity, the love. You flow through the hall tasting each flavor, letting joy flood your senses.

Through the next doorway, you enter a cavern where coins of golden light drift like snowflakes. You catch handfuls of them and release them, watching them multiply. They swirl into spirals, crafting bridges of luminescence that lead you deeper into your own potential. Every golden coin is an idea, a gift, or a resource you’ve overlooked—now rediscovered and amplified.

Finally, you step into a glass dome under a twilight sky. Stars pulse in patterns you recognize: the constellations of your dreams, hopes, and untapped talents. You lie back on a bed of soft moss and feel fully held by the universe. Scarcity dissolves. In its place, an unshakeable knowing rises: you are never without. There is always more light, more love, more capacity within you.

You wake with your heartbeat humming in gratitude, carrying that dream’s gift into the waking world: an abundance mindset that transforms every cracked ledge into a pathway of gold.
