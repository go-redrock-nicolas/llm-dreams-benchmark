I am dreaming. You blink against the glare of red warning lights, heart hammering as klaxons rifle through the corridors like a swarm of metallic hornets. Your uniform—silver-threaded and trimmed with unknowable insignia—feels impossibly heavy on your shoulders. Before you stretches a panoramic viewport to the void: a roiling nebula tinted violet and jade, studded with shards of starlight. Yet outside beauty, you know, hides catastrophe.  

Despite having no memory of space travel, you find your fingers moving instinctively over the command console’s luminescent touch-keys. A holographic panel springs to life, pulsing with urgent data streams. Main life-support is offline; oxygen reserves have dipped to 42 percent. A cascade of error codes scrolls in alien glyphs you somehow understand: “Turbine breach in sector 7C… warp core gravimetric imbalance… time dilation risk increasing.” Your mind fights panic—yet each new alarm feels less like chaos and more like an old friend calling your name.  

You rise from the captain’s throne, every step echoing on the metal deck as if the ship itself welcomes you home. Crew members in crisp gray jumpsuits rush past, their faces pale beneath the unrelenting crimson glow. One pauses at your side, eyes wide. “Captain,” she whispers, voice cracking, “the breach is spreading to the cargo bay. If we don’t realign the harmonic resonator, the entire starboard hull will implode in under two minutes.”  

Instinct floods through you—beyond logic or memory. You press your palm to the panel; sensors flicker, as though recognizing your touch. On the viewport, the nebula’s colors twist into a warning sigil: a burning lotus. Breathing steadies, you map a solution in your head—reroute power from nonessential sectors to stabilize the resonator’s tachyon matrix. You’ve never done this before, yet every circuit, every valve, every protocol feels etched in muscle-memory.  

With a snap of decision, you stride toward the corridor leading to sector 7C. The ship’s bulkheads hum softly beneath your boots, responding to the harmonic frequency you’re already singing inside your mind. Behind you, the crew rallies: one engineer cranks the manual override, another secures the hatch behind you, sealing off the failing zone.  

Outside, the nebula pulses again, as if cheering you on. Somewhere in the back of your dream-mind, a single thought whispers: “This is who you always were.” Your hand hovers over the final switch. With the fate of hundreds of souls caught in your breath, you plunge forward into the heart of the malfunction—and of a destiny you never knew you had.
