I am dreaming. I'm floating weightlessly through a library where the bookshelves spiral upward into infinity, each tome bound in covers that shimmer with memories rather than titles. As I reach for one particularly luminous volume, I notice my hands have become translucent, revealing not bones but tiny constellations pulsing beneath my skin.

The realization strikes me: I've promised to read every book in this endless library by morning. I've made this same impossible promise before, countless times, to countless expectant faces that now appear between the shelves, watching, waiting.

"No," I whisper, my voice echoing strangely, tasting like honey and static. "I can't possibly read them all."

The moment I speak these words, the spiral shelves begin to fold inward like origami, creating new paths and doorways. A river of liquid moonlight appears at my feet, winding between now-manageable stacks of books—only those I truly desire to read.

I step onto a bridge made of woven spider silk and pause. Below me, the reflection shows not my face but a version of myself surrounded by only the commitments that matter most, smiling with genuine peace rather than the stretched-thin smile I've worn for so long.

The watching faces don't disappear in anger as I feared—instead, they nod in understanding, some even offering gentle applause that sounds like falling autumn leaves.

"Boundaries aren't walls," whispers a butterfly with pages for wings as it lands on my shoulder, "they're horizons that define your true landscape."

The dream shifts, and I'm standing in a garden where every flower represents a "yes" I've given freely rather than reluctantly, blooming with magnificent vibrancy because they have the space to grow.
