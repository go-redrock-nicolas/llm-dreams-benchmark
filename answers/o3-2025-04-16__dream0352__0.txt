I am dreaming. …find yourself drifting through a sky that has no up or down, only broad ribbons of color—turquoise, ember-gold, violet shot through with tiny constellations that wink like knowing eyes. Warm wind plays with your hair while a distant, heartbeat-slow drum thrums beneath everything, as steady as the belief you have always held: Time is a straight road, one hour obediently following the last.

Below, an island rises: a marble labyrinth etched with clocks instead of walls. Their faces glow, and every second hand points in the same resolute direction—forward, forward, forward. You land beside the nearest clock and press your palm to its glass. It purrs like a cat, then melts. The gears slip out and rearrange themselves into shimmering, serpentine loops that coil around your wrist like friendly bracelets.

“Time is not a road,” whispers a voice that seems to float from the labyrinth itself. “It is a garden.” As you turn, the entire maze dissolves into terraces of soil freshly turned, sprouting sprouts instantly unfurling. Minutes are seedlings here; hours burst into orchards; decades twist like sprawling grapevines heavy with memory. You watch a peach pit drop, root, bloom, and rot into mulch all in the space of a breath.

A realization detonates gently inside your chest: the arrow of time—birth, youth, age, death—was never an imperious law but merely the way your culture chose to read the garden’s growth rings. Some peoples tend the rows in spirals, others in mirrored halves; some pluck fruit at dusk, others at dawn, yet the garden remains the garden.

Freed from the single rigid path, you wander. You meet children who are already elders in another furrow, and old women who have yet to choose their names. You taste wine pressed from next century’s grapes and feel tomorrow’s sunshine warming your cheek. Along the way you shed habits like obsolete tools: the frantic checking of clocks, the guilty hurried meals, the nervous countdowns to milestones.

At the garden’s heart stands a pool the color of molten silver. Your reflection ripples, showing multiple versions of you—laughing, weeping, dreaming, dancing—none first, none last. You dip a finger into the water, and the entire sky overhead blooms with spirals, echoing the loops around your wrist.

A hush falls. The heartbeat-drum fades. You understand now: existence is not a march but an ever-unfolding chorus, each voice entering when it wishes, lingering as long as it can, then drifting into harmony with the rest.

When you finally wake, ordinary morning light filters through your window. The alarm clock ticks dutifully on the nightstand, but you no longer hear it as a tyrant; it is only one flower in a vast, unruly garden you now know how to wander.
