I am dreaming. In this dream, I am walking down a busy city street when suddenly the ground begins to shake. People around me scream and panic as buildings sway and crumble. I try to run but am pushed aside by the hysterical crowd. 

As the shaking intensifies, I realize that a catastrophic event is unfolding - an earthquake! I look up at the clock tower and see that there are only 60 minutes left until a tsunami will hit this very spot. 

Despite my warnings, no one believes me. People continue to scramble for safety, causing chaos and confusion. I try to reason with them, to make them understand the impending danger, but my words fall on deaf ears. 

The sky darkens, and the ground continues to shudder. I can feel the waves coming closer. As the countdown reaches zero, everything goes black. A massive wall of water towers over the city, engulfing everything in its path. People scream as they are swept away by the raging tide. 

I wake up with a start, my heart pounding. It was just a dream, I tell myself. But the feeling of helplessness and despair lingers as I try to shake off the nightmare.
