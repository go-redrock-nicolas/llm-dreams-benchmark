I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I am walking through a crowded street market, the senses overloading with colors, aromas, and sounds. I feel a rush of energy, like a meaningful conversation with a close friend. Suddenly, I notice someone I haven't seen in a while – an old schoolmate. They wave hello, and before I can think twice, I return the gesture enthusiastically. We chat for a while about our lives, our dreams, and our fears. It feels effortless, as if we're picking up where we left off all those years ago. 

As we continue browsing the stalls, I notice an intricate mosaic on the ground, captivating me. It's made of tiny pieces of broken glass and pottery, yet it forms a beautiful pattern. The artist, an elderly woman with kind eyes, explains that she collects these pieces from the trash and uses them to create art, giving them new life. Her story resonates deeply with me, and I ask if I can help her in any way. She brightens up and hands me a small bag filled with broken fragments. Together, we begin to arrange them into something meaningful, bonding over the therapeutic process of creating something beautiful out of discarded items. 

The sun starts to set, casting a warm glow on the market. I realize that my time with the old schoolmate and the artist has passed too quickly. As I leave, the old woman hands me a small mosaic – a token of our brief yet profound connection. I acknowledge that this dream mirrors my journey in life; to embrace my authenticity and create meaningful connections with others, just like the artist creating beauty from rubies.
