I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the center of a vast glass atrium filled with people. Sunlight streams through the crystalline ceiling, fracturing into countless rainbow fragments across the marble floor. Despite hundreds of bodies moving around me—their silk garments rustling, their voices creating a symphony of murmurs—I feel utterly alone. Each person's face appears slightly blurred, as if viewed through frosted glass. When I reach toward someone, they drift away like smoke, maintaining a perfect and impossible distance.

The crowd parts suddenly, revealing a winding staircase made of luminescent blue material that seems to both absorb and emit light. I'm drawn to it irresistibly. As I climb, the steps respond to my touch, leaving glowing footprints that pulse with my heartbeat.

At the top, I discover a small circular room with windows overlooking an impossible landscape—half underwater realm, half cosmic expanse. In the center sits a weathered wooden table with a single object: a tarnished silver music box.

When I open it, instead of music, it releases a brilliant constellation of fireflies that hover before me, arranging themselves into the face of someone I feel I've always known but cannot name. The face smiles with profound understanding, and for the first time, the loneliness dissipates like morning mist.

The fireflies disperse, rushing through the windows and pulling me with them, across landscapes that shift between memories and possibilities, toward a horizon that promises connection beyond words.
