I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You find yourself in a dimension where time flows backwards and cause follows effect. To accomplish even basic tasks in this inverted reality, you must first un-sip your tea before watching it gather itself from empty space into a porcelain cup. You cannot unlock a door by turning the key—you must first watch the door open on its own, then feel the key curl gently into your palm.

You stand at the edge of a river whose waters rush uphill into a glowing sapphire pool above. The sky is a living watercolor of fading sunsets: lavender melting into peach, then reassembling into deep indigo clouds that bleed back into daylight. As you step forward, each footfall un-prints itself, leaving behind dust motes that collide into your shoe and disappear. You inhale the chill air—and feel warmth leaving your lungs in reverse.

Beside the riverbank, emerald reeds coil themselves back into the muddy earth. You reach out to touch one, but your hand pulls away at the last moment—because the reed itself un-coiled, winding back around your finger before you ever made contact. You laugh—and the sound rushes into your throat, un-laughing in a soft echo that ripples through the trees.

A gentle bell rings somewhere ahead, but you hear only the silence before the strike. Stepping through a scalloped archway of pink marble, you enter a courtyard where flowers grow skyward from petals into buds, then back into seeds tucked inside their green husks. To pick one, you must first watch a seed shoot into your palm from the heavens, then sprout there into a full blossom.

In the center of the courtyard stands a fountain, its water shooting upward in frozen droplets that drip back into the basin below. You kneel and cup your hands—yet the water leaps from your open palms, reforming into crystal jets that ascend into the air. Only then does the basin refill, the pool of liquid archiving the un-told stories of every visitor.

At the far wall, a mirror suspended in midair shows you a reflection that speaks before you speak, gesturing words you have yet to think. You watch your mirrored self whisper a secret—though in this realm, secrets travel from listener to speaker. You receive the secret, understanding it fully, and only then do your lips part to frame the words.

To leave this place, you cannot simply step through a door; you must first complete each action in reverse. You sit on the fountain’s edge, un-splashing droplets until the water is still. You un-wade across the river, feeling the cold ripple un-touch your ankles. You un-breathe until the chill air rushes into your lungs. Finally, you swallow your tea un–cupful by un–cupful, watching it dissolve into nothingness, and only then the world blinks back into forward motion—and you awaken.
