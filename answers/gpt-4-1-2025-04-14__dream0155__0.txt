I am dreaming.

I walk barefoot onto a stage that shifts and shimmers like liquid glass under my feet, the boundaries of the arena stretching away into a yawning void scattered with stars. My heartbeat is thunder in my ears, a private drum summoning courage as the audience—an endless cascade of faceless forms—holds its collective breath. The competition is calligraphy, but not of ink on paper. Here, the medium is air itself, and each swoop and flick of my hands weaves visible currents of color, light, and music into dazzling patterns. 

My rivals stand at the edges of this stage, their bodies composed, their auras radiant with experience. Each has trained for decades: the graceful maestro from Kyoto whose whispers shape the wind, the mathematician from Prague drawing fractal runes midair, the virtuoso from Lagos, braiding harmonies into streams of gold and violet. And there I am—just months ago, clumsy and unsure, struggling with basics and making storms out of lines.

The final challenge is announced by a booming voice that echoes from nowhere and everywhere: “Compose a portrait of hope, using only the unknown language of your heart.”

I close my eyes for a tremulous moment. My fingers tingle, aching to begin, despite the tremor of inexperience. When I open them again, I let go—forgetting rules, breathing in possibility. Light spills from my fingertips, tentative but growing bolder. I conjure cerulean rivers and feathered arcs, spun from the raw nerves of my memory: the taste of morning’s first light when I nearly gave up, the surge of joy from a breakthrough, the kindness I received from those who believed in a beginner’s spark.

The masters create precise, elegant glyphs—full of technique and tradition. Mine is flawed, wild, dancing with unpredictable color. My hands shape spiraling threads, a story only I could tell. Forgotten lullabies tangle with half-remembered dreams, each gesture pulsing with the rhythm of my desperate hope.

The arena grows quiet, every gaze drawn to the trembling hemisphere I’ve woven: a lattice of mistakes intertwined with earnest longing, luminous and fragile as a soap bubble in twilight. It isn’t perfect. In fact, it flickers at the edges—but inside it, all the rawness and wonder I possess flare bright, unguarded.

A hush sweeps the world as my creation lingers one impossible moment longer in the air, before dissolving into a rain of silver motes. And then—the audience erupts, their applause a thunder that polishes the night, while the masters nod in silent appreciation. The dream dissolves, but the feeling—impossibly triumphant, achingly alive—lingers long after I wake.
