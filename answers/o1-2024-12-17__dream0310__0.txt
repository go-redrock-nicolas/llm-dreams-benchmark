I am dreaming. You find yourself in a winding corridor of a temple made from ivory stones streaked with russet veins. The walls seem to give off a soft, silvery glow that flickers whenever you move. Hooded figures shuffle past you, each wearing robes of a deep emerald hue. Although you do not recognize their language, you hear their gentle incantations drifting on the air like a low, melodic wind. Subtle scents of incense—an intoxicating swirl of sandalwood and star anise—mingle in the corridor, drifting with a gentle pulse that seems to match the heartbeat in your chest.

A guide in the same emerald robes softly touches your wrist, beckoning you forward. You step into a vast ceremonial hall illuminated by a circular opening in the ceiling. Through it, beams of starlight filter down as though eager to participate in this sacred gathering. In the center of the hall stands a massive statue with twelve arms outspread, each hand holding an unfamiliar emblem or talisman. The statue’s carved eyes are both fierce and compassionate, exuding the unmistakable presence of something both ancient and alive. You feel a hum in the air—an energy sifting through the temple, reaching into your mind.

Someone hands you a small, slender candle of burgundy wax, expecting you to light it at the foot of the statue. Unsure of the tradition, you move hesitantly. Nevertheless, your guide whispers a soothing word, and in your dream-state you find yourself confident enough to follow. The wick bursts into a tiny flame that dances with surprising liveliness. The statue’s stone eyes catch the glow, glittering slightly, as if acknowledging your gesture. The crowd around you murmurs in hushed, reverent tones, and you can feel the unity of collective devotion pulsing through your own fingertips.

Suddenly, the chanting escalates in volume, weaving harmonies you’ve never heard before. The words vibrate in your bones, and with each syllable, the statue’s carved features seem to shift subtly. You feel an otherworldly trembling beneath your feet. It’s as if the very ground is resonating with the fervor of this ceremony. Drums echo from the corners of the cavernous hall, each rhythmic beat aligning with your heartbeat until you can no longer distinguish one from the other.

A gentle swirl of color catches your eye—at first just a faint vortex of smoke wafting from golden censers, but it soon fills the air with swaying ribbons of turquoise and lilac. The hooded figures, still lost in their song, form a wide circle around you, closing in just enough for you to sense their proximity. Your guide gently presses a small bowl of water into your hands, the liquid shimmering under the flickering candlelight. With one last, resounding chant, they nod for you to drink, and you do. The taste is indescribable—like mint touched by morning frost, strangely sweet with an electric undercurrent.

Within seconds, you feel the world expanding around you. Your vision swims; the pillars supporting the temple stretch upward like the trunks of cosmic trees, branching into infinite star-flecked plazas above. Every breath seems to resonate with boundless space, as if you’re breathing in the essence of stardust and ancient prayers. A soothing presence encompasses your mind; words, images, and stories not your own slip into your consciousness like distant echoes from a thousand years ago. You sense that you are accepted in this moment, by a force older than any tradition you’ve ever known.

The chanting tapers off and transitions into a hushed silence. One by one, the hooded figures bow before you and the statue, placing their palms together in a gesture of mutual reverence. In that stillness, you feel your heart flutter with an unfamiliar yet profound connection—recognition that this rite, though not your own, places you in a timeless current of belief shared by countless souls. You stand there, candle in hand, soul brimming with borrowed faith and the whisper of something deeply universal coursing through your veins. Then, as the last echoes of chanting fade into the quiet, the dream dissolves in a shimmering haze, carrying you back toward wakefulness with the ghostly imprint of this sacred ceremony etched into your memory.
