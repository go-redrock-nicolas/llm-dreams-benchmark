I am dreaming. …you feel your heart lurch against your ribs, hammering like a frantic bird desperate to be free. A chill wind brushes past you—yet there is no breeze, no open window, no visible escape. Instead, you find yourself in a cavernous hall with walls made of obsidian glass, and each surface ripples as if barely containing something ghastly behind it. A faint glow from an unseen source illuminates the shiny black floors where your reflection trembles under flickering light.

Your greatest fear—whatever name you dare give it—begins to coalesce in the center of this endless chamber. It looks at you with piercing eyes, monstrous and too large, spindly limbs or slithering tentacles or ghostly wings—shifting through impossible shapes that make your stomach clench. At times it is pitch-black in color, other times as pallid as a bleached skull, occasionally churning with a murky, poisonous green radiance that stings your eyes.

An icy terror threatens to paralyze you. You sense your legs weakening, the floor beneath your feet turning slick and uncertain, as though you stand on black ice. You taste fear in the back of your throat, metallic and bitter. In the corners of your vision, you see the shadows swirl, forming spidery silhouettes that crawl along the walls and vanish into the shimmering obsidian panels. It feels as though you’re trapped inside a living creature’s belly, and everything around you pulses with a slow, sickly rhythm.

Yet a small voice of courage inside you begins to hum, a feeble spark in this impossible darkness. You close your eyes, inhaling slowly, forcing yourself to exhale in a measured breath. The swirling illusions behind your eyelids threaten to pull you even deeper into dread, but you focus—one heartbeat at a time—on the warmth that still exists within you. A memory of sunshine, or laughter, or the comforting touch of a friend blossoms behind your closed lids. You harness this fleeting memory, gathering your resolve and shaping it into a single, fiery ember of hope.

When you open your eyes once more, the vast chamber quivers, almost as if startled by your defiance. The nightmare entity, that mass of living horror, twitches in response. For an instant, its shimmering form falters, and you see—it is not invincible. In that sliver of clarity, you lift your hand, and it glows with the same soft warmth of your treasured memory, radiating pulses of light against the trembling obsidian walls. 

You take a step forward, no longer a hapless victim. Though the cold terror still lingers, you envision your breath as a cleansing gale, peeling away the dread. The monstrous figure’s snaking limbs withdraw slightly, as if tasting the air for this new sensation of courage. Another trembling step forward, and sparks flare at your fingertips, cutting through the gloom like dawn breaking over a black horizon.

Your terror remains colossal, but your heart feels unchained. Each fresh breath billows fuller with the knowledge that you can stand against this specter. The obsidian prison wavers, cracks forming in its glossy surface. Like thunder splitting the night, an echoing roar seems to emanate from the fractured walls. Shards of black glass tumble away, clattering on the floor like broken pieces of midnight, letting in threads of shimmering gold. It is the promise of daylight, of rescue, of a new beginning beyond these walls.

And in that blinding burst of warmth and light, you finally understand: you are stronger than your fears. Even in the darkest dreamscape, the spark of hope can become an inferno, burning away the shadows at your command. In the next moment, you awaken—heart pounding, surrounded by the comforting everyday details of your room—yet forever changed by the fierce clarity that flowed from your deepest imagination.
