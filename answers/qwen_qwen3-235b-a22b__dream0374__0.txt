I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning myrrh and wet stone, a cloying perfume that clings to the back of your throat. I stand at the edge of a vast, cathedral-like chamber, its vaulted ceiling lost in shadows that writhe like smoke. Below, a crowd ripples with applause, their faces blurred, their voices a chorus of distant bells. At the center of it all, bathed in a cone of golden light, stands **him**—the one they’re praising. His smile is a blade wrapped in velvet, his hands raised in false humility as he accepts a trophy forged from liquid starlight. It pulses in time with his heartbeat, or maybe mine.  

The award is for *our* work.  

I feel the weight of it in my chest, a phantom ache where the truth should reside. My fingers twitch, remembering the nights we spent stitching this creation together—**I** wove the constellations into its spine, **I** bled ink into its gears, **I** taught it to breathe. But now, as he speaks, his words are polished lies that gleam like glass. The crowd drinks them, their eyes wide as children watching a conjurer pull rabbits from a hat.  

A cold wind snakes through the room, though there are no windows. It whispers my name, tugging at the hem of my shadow. I realize I’m wearing a cloak of ash-gray moth wings, each feathered filament trembling with unspoken words. No one turns to see me. I am a ghost in the margins, a footnote erased.  

Then the dream shifts.  

The trophy cracks.  

A fissure splits its surface, and from it spills not shards, but **light**—raw and prismatic, searing through the crowd’s adoration. They recoil, shielding their eyes, but I step forward, my pulse a drumbeat in the sudden silence. The impostor stumbles back, his smile faltering as the light coils around me like a serpent recognizing its maker. It’s not anger I feel now, but a terrible, aching clarity. This brilliance was never meant to be hoarded. It was meant to be **seen**, not owned.  

The chamber dissolves.  

Now I’m standing in a field of obsidian glass, the sky above a bruise of indigo and sulfur-yellow. The trophy lies shattered at my feet, its fragments blooming into tiny, self-contained galaxies. The impostor is gone. Only the wind remains, carrying the faint hum of a lullaby I once sang to my own ambition. I kneel, press my palm to the ground, and feel the earth shudder—a silent applause from the bones of the world.  

When I wake, my cheeks are wet.  

The dream lingers, not as a wound, but as a map. It shows me the difference between hunger and nourishment, between the hunger for praise and the deeper, quieter feast of knowing what you’ve built with your own hands. The trophy was never real. The light was. The field was. The ache in my throat, that raw, holy thing—that was the truth trying to claw its way out.  

And somewhere, deep in the marrow, I understand: **Some creations are meant to be lit from within, even if no one ever sees the flame.**
