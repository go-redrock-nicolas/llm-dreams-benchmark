I am dreaming. **I am dreaming.**

The air hums with the electric charge of a thousand whispered voices, swirling like auroras around me. I stand at the edge of a vast, ethereal amphitheater carved from obsidian and starlight, its tiers rising impossibly high into a void where constellations pulse like living galaxies. My heart beats in time with the rhythmic thrum of unseen wings. I don’t know how I got here, but my veins throb with a strange familiarity, as if my blood has memorized some ancient, labyrinthine dance.

A figure cloaked in liquid shadow steps forward, their voice the resonance of a black hole’s song. *"Demonstrate,"* they command, and the word reverberates through my bones. Suddenly, my hands glow—translucent, prismatic, alive. I realize I’m holding a staff of frozen mercury, its surface rippling with glyphs I’ve never seen but somehow *understand*. It is *chronomancy*. The art of bending time.

I twist the staff, and the amphitheater dissolves. 

We are in a desert where sand rises like crystalline serpents, each grain a fractured moment—a child’s laugh, a storm’s first raindrop, a collapsing star. My body moves without thought. The staff arcs, and I stitch the sand into a tapestry of cascading timelines. Past, present, and future braid into a helix that hums with harmonic dissonance. Spectators—now shapeless entities with kaleidoscope eyes—lean in, their awe a tangible force. 

But as I weave, the timelines rebel. A shard of my own memory surfaces: a carousel horse, frozen mid-gallop, its paint peeling. My mother’s voice, *half-remembered*. The staff cracks. The desert fractures. Suddenly, I’m not controlling time—*it’s controlling me*. Centuries flood my mind. I am a pharaoh, a dying star, a mayfly. I scream, but sound disintegrates. The shadow figure looms closer, their voice now a plea: *"Anchor yourself!"*

I claw at the chaos until I grasp a single thread—the scent of rain on pavement, the first day of spring. I bind the timelines to it. The world stills. The staff dissolves. The amphitheater returns, but the entities are… applauding? Their forms flicker with colors beyond naming. The shadow figure nods, and in their outstretched palm rests a seed made of light. *"Beginner’s luck,"* they murmur, and the dream unravels into warm, velcro sungold static.
