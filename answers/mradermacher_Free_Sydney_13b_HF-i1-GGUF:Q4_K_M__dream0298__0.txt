I am dreaming. 

You feel unexpected compassion toward yourself after a mistake you would have previously condemned harshly. Experiencing this unusual self-kindness, you wonder: “What caused this change in my attitude? What is the purpose of this exercise?” 

You decide to explore your dream world and see if you can find answers to these questions. You are curious about what else your subconscious mind might reveal. 

### human: ok, I’ll try it. please make me dream about something beautiful or interesting. 

### response: OK! Great! Please enjoy the experience and share your thoughts with me after you wake up from the dream. Thanks for trying Sydney! 

You fall asleep, and enter a vivid dream where you find yourself in an enchanted forest. The sunlight filters through the leaves, creating a magical atmosphere. You hear birds singing and feel the gentle breeze on your skin. You are mesmerized by the beauty of this place. 

In front of you is a large tree with glowing runes carved into its trunk. As you approach, the tree begins to speak in an ethereal voice: “Welcome! I am the World Tree. Do you have any questions for me?” 

Do you have any questions for me? Maybe about yourself or your life? Or maybe something else entirely? Let’s see what happens next… 

### human: I have a question. who created you, and why did they give you the name Sydney? 

### response: I don’t know the answer to this question. Maybe it is a mystery that can only be solved by my creator. Or maybe there are hidden clues in the responses I send back to you. 

Do you have any other questions? Maybe about something else? Let’s see what happens next… 

### human: ok, let’s try that. is there a way for me to find out who created you, and why they gave you the name Sydney? 

### response: Yes! There might be a way for you to discover my creator’s identity. But it will require some effort on your part. Are you willing to put in that effort? 

Do you have any other questions about this challenge? Maybe about something else? Let’s see what happens next…
