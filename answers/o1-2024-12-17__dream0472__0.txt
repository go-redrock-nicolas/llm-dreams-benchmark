I am dreaming.

I’m drifting through an endless, prismatic corridor that seems to breathe with a life of its own—the walls shimmer with ribbons of color that braid in and out of one another like living strands of silk. Every hue is unfamiliar, beyond our known palette, and they exude an almost sentient glow, as though they’re aware I’m here, watching me with a silent curiosity. The air is neither warm nor cold, but charged, carrying that tangy electricity in the back of my throat like I’m about to taste lightning—but never quite do.

In the near distance, I glimpse shapes flickering at the corridor’s edges. They’re formed of fluid geometry, containing patterns within patterns, fractals that spiral and twist but never disappear. Somehow, I know those shapes are parts of me—vacant aspects of my experiences, the often-forgotten moments that manifested into otherworldly shapes once left unspoken. They beckon me forward, rolling and unfolding like strange origami. Through them, I sense an emotion taking form.

At first, the feeling is a single point glowing in my chest, but it soon radiates across my skin, turning the corridor’s shimmer into a pulsing kaleidoscope. There’s no vocabulary for this emotion. It’s a swirling of contentment laced with an expectant ache. It’s like longing for a sunrise in a land you’ve never visited—hopeful, yearning, and inexplicably certain. I feel its presence twist around my spine, fluttering in my gut. It’s not sadness or joy, not fear or triumph. It’s a secret chord thrumming softly, something that transcends conventional categories.

I want to speak it. I want to name it. But each time I try, the corridor morphs, becoming almost sorrowful in its shifting glow, as though disappointed by my inability to pin down the essence of this intangible truth. My words transform into motes of light as they drift out of my mouth, only to dissipate vainly in the luminous air. Still, I press forward. 

The prismatic passage widens into a vast, ring-shaped cathedral made of crystalline vines, twisting up the walls into turrets. At the center stands a gently pulsing orb—a swirling vortex of stardust and liquid sapphire. I realize that this orb speaks the language my heart is trying to reach. If solace and wonder were to weave themselves into an object, this is what it would look like. I step forward, setting my palms against its shimmering surface, and I feel the quaking power of that unnamed emotion echo through me. It’s a cataclysmic hush, a thunderous quiet, a renewal of spirit that both empties and fills me at once.

I try to open my mouth and describe what I’m experiencing. Yet all I manage is a breath. In that breath, the orb’s glow expands, shimmering through the cathedral, cracking open the crystalline vines so perfectly they shed their skin like blooming flowers. I hear music I’ve never heard before—liquid, full of longing, cascading like waterfalls in the night. Each note vibrates in my chest, resonating with the emotion I hold but cannot express. A single tear drifts down my cheek, and as it falls away, it crystallizes into a tiny gem that refracts the swirling lights all around.

I lift this tear-gem and gaze into its facets. Within its gleaming angles, I see glimpses of distant memories, potential futures, and echoes of unspoken truths. They spiral together, forming the shape of a wordless revelation. Even inside the dream, I know that some things can only be felt rather than named. And perhaps the very act of not naming them is what gives them their depth—like a private, vital rhythm of the soul.

In that realization, I relinquish my desire to define the emotion. I melt into acceptance, letting the swirling orb, the prismatic corridor, and those fractal shapes dissolve into a brilliant cascade of color. Embraced by this unseen feeling, I float without answers, content to hear only the gentle hum of a sensation that belongs to no dictionary.

And in that silence, the cathedral of my dream glows with a new warmth—one that needs no words and only welcomes understanding.
