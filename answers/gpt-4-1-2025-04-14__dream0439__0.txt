I am dreaming.

The world around me ripples with unreal colors: skies that drift from molten gold to deep indigo, clouds blooming in strange geometry overhead. I find myself in a lush, pulsing forest, where every step along the soft, mossy ground releases a gentle chorus of musical notes, each footfall familiar yet faintly tinged with longing. In my arms, I cradle a delicate glass globe—it radiates warmth, yet I know it holds only fleeting solace.

Drawn by an aching need in my chest, I return again and again to a low-hanging, shimmering fruit from a silver tree. Each bite—honeyed, cooling—quiets the storm inside for a glittering instant. But as the sweetness fades, sadness curls in the pit of my stomach, and brambles grow thicker around my feet. The fruit is always within reach, and I grasp it, again and again, seeking comfort while the forest grows darker, chill mist snaking between the branches.

Somewhere deeper in the dream, a strange, persistent rhythm starts—like a distant drum calling through the trees. I recognize the sound: my own heart, urging me to break free. I realize then, vividly, that the fruit is but an illusion, feeding my stagnation.

With trembling hands, I let go of the glass globe. It shatters on the mossy ground, dissolving into a thousand fireflies that lift the mist. I step away from the silver tree as the brambles recede, knowing the ache may return, but also trusting that it will not devour me. Ahead, a path of luminescent stones emerges, each one lighting up as I place my foot down. The forest opens—wider, warmer, full of possibilities and mysterious, beckoning melodies.

I walk forward, out of the repeating comfort of the dream, into a world where every step is uncertain, but my spirit feels lighter, brimming with hope, and the promise that I can always chart a new way through the forest, toward the dawn that waits beyond the trees.
