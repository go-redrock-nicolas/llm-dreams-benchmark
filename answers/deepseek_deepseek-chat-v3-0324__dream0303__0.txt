I am dreaming. 1. **Swim in a sea of shimmering silver fish** where the water is warm and thick like honey, their scales reflecting fractured rainbows onto my skin as I move weightlessly through the luminous depths. 2. **Walk into a corridor lined with infinite doors**, each pulsing with a different heartbeat—some quick and frantic like hummingbird wings, others slow as distant thunder—knowing that beyond one lies everything I've ever longed for, unnamed until this very instant. 3. **Step onto a bridge of braided light** spanning a void where constellations are being born and dying in the same breath, feeling the tremors of collapsing stars beneath my bare feet while a chorus of unseen voices sings a language that dissolves and reforms my thoughts.  

The choice is made—I leap toward the bridge, and the moment my skin touches the light, I *remember*: this is the dream where I finally learn how to hold time still. The voices surge around me, weaving through my ribs, as the bridge trembles and *splinters*—not breaking, but *multiplying*, fractal branches spiraling outward into a forest of possibilities. One path glows hotter, throbbing like a vein—and without hesitation, I run toward it, laughing, as the stars explode into embers that taste like burnt sugar and forgiveness.
