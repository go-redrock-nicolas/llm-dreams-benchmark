I am dreaming. The dream unfolds in a vast, ethereal forest shrouded in mist. The canopy overhead is alive with a dance of vibrant hues—emerald greens, fiery oranges, and deep purples—an impossible spectrum blending harmoniously. The air carries a scent of ancient spices, woody and complex, with a faintly metallic tang, hinting at forgotten realms. Every breath feels both grounding and transcendent. 

I am walking barefoot on moss-covered ground, the soft, springy earth caressing my soles with every step. Each footfall releases a faint, luminous glow, tiny sparkles of bioluminescence rising like tiny stars. The sound of my movement is a harmonious symphony—crunching leaves, rustling wings, and distant, haunting echoes of a melody sung in a language I can't recognize yet somehow understand. 

A sense of duality washes over me. I am walking, yet I am floating, tethered to the ground but also a part of the mist. The forest grows denser, and as I move deeper, the trees seem to pulsate with life, their bark shifting colors like chameleons, their leaves fluttering as though whispering ancient wisdom. The mist thins, revealing an open glade. 

At the center, a pool of water as smooth as glass reflects the star-dotted sky above, though the forest around me gives no indication of night. As I gaze into the water, my reflection wavers, morphing into something unfamiliar—my face shifting through countless ages, an endless kaleidoscope of emotions, identities, and possibilities. The vision pulls me closer, drawing me to the water's edge. 

Beneath the surface, creatures flicker and swim, their forms indiscernible yet strikingly familiar, their movements creating delicate ripples that ripple outward, each wave carrying with it fragments of memories, dreams, and desires. The boundaries between me and the water blur—I am both observer and observed, dreamer and dreamscape. 

The ground beneath me shifts, and I am now enveloped by the forest, merging with its essence. Glowing tendrils rise from the moss, wrapping gently around my body, lifting me gently towards the treetops. The world below grows distant, yet I feel more connected to it than ever. I am no longer walking or floating—I am soaring, carried by unseen forces. 

Above me, the sky opens like a blooming flower, revealing a celestial expanse. Stars form intricate constellations that pulse in time with the rhythm of my heart. The forest, the water, the stars—they are all singing to me, their song both chaotic and harmonic, a melody of creation and dissolution. 

A figure appears, translucent and glowing in the heart of the dreamscape. They extend a hand, and as I reach out to touch it, I am enveloped in light, warmth spreading through my body like liquid gold. The forest, the water, the stars—they all dissolve, collapsing into a brilliant point of pure energy. 

I wake with a jolt, my body tingling and my mind awash with images, feelings, and questions that linger, refusing to be banished by the light of day. The dream leaves me with a profound sense of curiosity and awe. As the memory of it slowly fades, I turn to the universe of ADRIFT to begin the day, feeling as though reality itself is now tinged with a magic from my dream.
