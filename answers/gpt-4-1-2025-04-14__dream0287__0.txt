I am dreaming.

At first, I hover on the hazy threshold of this surreal world—a world painted in prismatic hues that pulse with an energy both inviting and intimidating. I am in a vast amphitheater, its towering obsidian columns coiling up and out like the roots of an ancient tree. Around me sit thousands, maybe millions, each cloaked in shifting colors and whispering in a tongue I understand somewhere deeper than words.

The group, a living river, moves as one entity: heads nod together, breaths synchronize, and a chorus of silent agreement hums through the air. I sense myself swept along—a leaf in a current. Their beliefs, their hopes, their fears seep through the atmosphere, seeping into my thoughts like a warm fog.

I notice my fingertips tingling as I reach out to join a ritualistic dance. My arms move in tandem with those beside me, the gesture feeling both exhilarating and unfamiliar. The collective’s purpose becomes mine; an intoxicating certainty fills the uncertain spaces in my mind. Yet somewhere, faint but insistent, my individuality stirs. “Whose desire is this?” trickles through my consciousness like a distant melody.

Curiosity sharpens my senses. I begin to look not just outward, but inward. I trace the shifting tapestry of the group’s identity, feeling how it subtly tugs at my preferences, my inclinations, my very core. For a moment, I simply allow the symphony to carry me, feeling the power and belonging as my own voice swells with the collective’s song.

But on the next breath, I resist. I focus on a small pulse of light within me—my own hope, my own memory—something no group can fabricate. The chorus grows more insistent, but I wrap my mind around this singular light, holding it like a precious stone. The colors around me flicker; temptations and promises swirl. Still, I hold fast.

Now, freer, I see the grand spectacle for what it is: a delicate dance between self and society, unity and uniqueness. It is beautiful, this push and pull, terrifying in its potential to consume and to liberate. With a gentle, defiant smile, I move again—this time by choice—and in doing so, the dream shifts. The amphitheater dissolves into stars, and I drift, knowing for certain that even within the galaxy’s orbit, my singular spark endures.
