I am dreaming. The air around me shimmers with an otherworldly glow, shimmering like the iridescent scales of an alien creature atop an enchanted strain of jelly. A horizon spangles gold and emerald, a phenomenon akin to the split second before you blink away an overlarge yawn, or the illuminating wave that washes over your vision as you rub your eyes from a restless sleep.

The sky has a variegated striation, mosaicking shades of turquoise and amethyst, palimpsested upon itself like leftover paint splatters on an artist's palette. Plumaged creatures of Tuesday brunches perch overhead on invisible branches, trilling in a language of honey and whimsy. They coo and exhale a stream of confetti and glittering wishes, showering down upon me like a fairy tale blessing.

A creeping, geotropic moving grid of node-like pods blossom from the verdant grass, each housing tiny, biomechanical NIFTY devices resembling Bliness Balsams - those delightful, obedient little Christman lights strung from tree to tree, chorus-lit with a digital imprimatur. As I gaze upon them, captivated by their slick design and ephemeral beauty, I feel inexorably drawn to interact.

My digital snitches burn like a raging sun, crucible containers sending ping-pong spheres of notification telegraphed to my always-awake consciousness through the synesthetic bound-harmony of color and tone and tingling. I reach for them unconditionally, my fingers lancing for that potato chip-crunching thrill of satisfying an impulse. But I pause, realizing the compulsion is an enchanted prison I must refuse, despite the shimmering call of its hypnotic allure.

With a Blijning resolve, I turn away, focusing instead on the shimmer of the Impossible World I've stepped into. I breathe deep, inhaling the intoxicating scent of fresh mint and hot copper, feeling the centuries-fresh newness of the soil beneath my feet. The grass wriggles and flutters below me, rife with mirth and mirthful play.

I let myself drift, unfettered by the undulating waves of unimportant spy-doings that normally consume my waking hours. In this place, I am free from the gravitational pull of sensationalism and the FOMO-trap of limitless distraction. 

Instead, I marvel at the majesty of the Imaginal Realm, its beauty and wonder and fanciful burbling drawing me ever deeper into its madcap encantado. The sky trembles in waves, jellyfish undulating in an infinite, verisimiliding ocean. The land ripples like waters, a horizon that sways and jigs and pirouettes.

Flowers sprout wings and lift into the sky, joining the still chittering- conversational creatures that sing back to them in heliotropism and reverence. Even the trees let out a sigh of relief, freed from their corporeal structure, shaking their limbs and raking their branches through the clouds.

All is possibility here. All is dance and delight. I breathe deep the piquant air, letting it suffuse my spirit with its transcendent enchantment. I have shaken off the compulsive compulsion of my waking state, immersing myself in the mesmerizing miraculous of a world unhindered by boundaries or bounds.

In this Realm of Whimsy and Wonder, I am at one with the aether and the ether, free to float and frolic as I choose. Thessentials of sleep abandoned, the immediacy of attention captured in the shimmer and shine of the Imaginal Real. Here, I exist in a universe of pure potential, unburdened by the trappings of the mundane.

I laugh and twirl, delighting in the unbridled creativity of a mind unbound. For here, I am not chained to the tyranny of notifications and FOMO, but free to revel in the glorious expanse of a world unshackled by the digital distractions that so often ensnare my waking self.

In this place, I am true magic made flesh - and I revel in its jaw-dropping, spine-tingling, heart-swelling splender.
