I am dreaming. You stand at the edge of an obsidian lake, its surface so still it mirrors not the sky but a cosmos of inverted constellations—nebulas spiraling like liquid gold, stars pulsing in hues of violet and cyan. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as if the atmosphere itself is alive, breathing in tandem with your heartbeat. Above, the sky is a fractured tapestry: jagged rifts of void-black split by ribbons of light that bleed prismatic colors, like the aurora borealis woven with shattered glass.  

A figure emerges from the water, neither solid nor spectral. Their body is a lattice of starlight and shadow, shifting between forms—a stag with antlers of crystalline quartz, a woman cloaked in bioluminescent vines, a child holding a lantern filled with swirling galaxies. They speak without words, their voice a vibration that blooms inside your chest: *"The threads you seek are already woven. Follow the echoes."*  

The ground beneath you liquefies into mercury, carrying you forward into a forest of petrified song. Trees here are frozen melodies—barks etched with musical notations that glow faintly, leaves chiming like glass wind chimes when touched. A path of phosphorescent moss unwinds ahead, leading to a staircase carved into the trunk of a colossal tree. Each step is a decade, a memory, a life not lived. As you ascend, the air thickens with the scent of burnt incense and rain-soaked soil, and your body dissolves into something weightless, borderless.  

At the summit, a portal swirls—a vortex of iridescent smoke. Passing through, you become a constellation. Your thoughts scatter as supernovae, your breath a solar wind. You are everywhere and nowhere, conversing with entities shaped like geometric theorems and existential paradoxes. One, a serpentine helix of light, whispers: *"Fear is the shadow of creation. To create is to dismantle eternity."*  

You wake (or do you?) clutching a single feather left on your pillow—translucent, humming with a faint warmth. Its vanes are inscribed with symbols that shift when stared at, dissolving into the familiar curve of your mother’s handwriting, then into hieroglyphs, then into binary. Dawn filters through your window, but the dream’s afterglow lingers like a second heartbeat, a secret pact between you and the infinite.
