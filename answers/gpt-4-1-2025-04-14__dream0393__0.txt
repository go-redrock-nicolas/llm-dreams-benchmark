I am dreaming.

I stand at the edge of a great, wild forest, its ancient trees rising as living pillars, entwined with silver mist. Behind me stretches a sun-drenched meadow filled with the soft, familiar scent of clover and the comforting hum of cicadas—my world of routine and safety. The warmth of sunlight lingers gently on my back, tugging at me with the lure of what I already know. Yet before me lies this beckoning twilight wood, each tree draped in moss, towering roots curling like fingers into secret hollows.

At the threshold—between the open, golden field and the shadowy labyrinth of trees—a road splits in two. One path, paved and well-worn, loops in a predictable circle around the meadow, promising the solace of repetition and familiarity. The other, wild and narrow, plunges into the forest’s green gloom, its earth trodden only by braver, unseen travelers. 

Above, the sky shifts. The clouds over the meadow blush with fading pink, while those above the forest swirl in deep indigo, alive with glimpses of unknown constellations. The air shudders with possibility. A soft breath of wind pushes past my cheeks, scented with strange, intoxicating flowers—blooms I have never seen, whose petals glisten with dew and mystery.

My heart pounds—a primordial drumbeat urging me toward something grand, yet perilous. The songs of hidden birds and the faint giggles of nearby brooklets echo in my ears, tantalizing and unfamiliar. A single golden feather falls from above, twirling between the two paths, settling softly on the wild trail; a small sign, delicate but clear.

I inhale, feeling the blend of fearful excitement and longing thicken inside my chest. I turn to the tangled, entrancing depths of the forest, the path dark at first but shimmering faintly as if lit by the distant sparks of possibility. Each step I take crackles with the unknown, and the world behind me seems to sigh, shrinking quietly away.

With one last glance at the warm embrace of safety, I choose the hushed song of the unfamiliar. The forest whispers: Welcome, dreamer. Come and see what only courage may reveal.
