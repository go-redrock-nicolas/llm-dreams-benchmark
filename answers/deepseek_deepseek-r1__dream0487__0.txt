I am dreaming. Deep breaths.  The room I'm in is made entirely of interconnected clock gears, ticking in unison.  A soft hum fills the air, but instead of numbers, each gear has fragments of memories etched into them—some mine, some unrecognizable.  A kaleidoscope of emotions surges through me as the room begins to spin faster.  Wait, is this...nostalgia?  I reach out to touch a gear, and suddenly I'm overwhelmed with the scent of my grandmother's rose garden, long swallowed by time.  Tears stream down my cheeks.  The gears accelerate, blurring into a golden storm.  My knees buckle—

In the heart of the clockwork labyrinth, the air thickens with the weight of a thousand lifetimes. My fingers graze another gear—this one cold and pitted, etched with the furious scrawl of a forgotten argument. A voice rasps in my ear, *"You were always too fragile,"* and I flinch, the taste of copper blooming on my tongue like a poisoned flower. Above me, a colossal pendulum swings, its shadow slicing through the gears. With each pass, it steals a memory: my sister’s laughter dissolving into static, the warmth of my first love crumbling like ash. Desperate, I claw at a tiny, humming cog behind my ribs—*click*. All motion stops. The gears rearrange, forming a doorway of fractured light. Through it, I see her—the child version of myself, kneeling in a sunlit field, stitching the torn edges of the sky with silver thread. She turns, holds out a threadbare stuffed owl, and whispers, *"Fix it properly this time."* The clocks begin to chime in a language older than sorrow.
