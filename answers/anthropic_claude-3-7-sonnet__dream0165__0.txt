I am dreaming. I find myself in a city bathed in perpetual twilight, where the streets pulse with rhythm instead of noise. Buildings sway gently like reeds in water—not from structural weakness but from an architectural philosophy that embraces movement. The inhabitants glide past me, their bodies fluid instruments of expression, fingertips leaving ephemeral trails of soft luminescence in the air.

I realize with startling clarity that my mouth has no purpose here. When I attempt to speak, no sound emerges, yet nobody seems alarmed. An elderly woman notices my confusion and approaches, her spine arcing into a gentle question mark, arms spiraling upward like morning glory vines. Somehow I understand: "You are new here. You seek connection."

My body responds before my mind can intervene—my shoulders rise and fall in waves, my hands carve patterns that feel ancient and familiar though I've never made them before. I'm asking for guidance, for belonging.

Children nearby translate my awkward movements, giggling not with mockery but delight. They form a circle around me, demonstrating how joy is a series of leaps, how sorrow flows from the collapse of the chest, how love is expressed through synchronized breathing with another.

In a central plaza, I witness debates conducted through intricate formations—political discourse through synchronized movement, philosophical arguments rendered in contrasting rhythms. A couple resolves a conflict through a dance that begins in sharp, opposing angles and gradually merges into harmonious curves.

As night deepens, I feel myself growing fluent in this wordless language, my body remembering what my mind never knew. I dance my life story to strangers who understand me more profoundly than anyone ever has through words alone—they weep and laugh as my body speaks truths I've never been able to articulate.

The dream begins dissolving at its edges when I realize: perhaps this isn't about dance replacing language, but about the body's wisdom that lies beneath our endless stream of words—a deeper knowing we've forgotten how to hear.
