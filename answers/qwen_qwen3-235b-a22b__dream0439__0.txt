I am dreaming. No, scrawling into the very ink of unconsciousness with a panicked scrawl of my dreaming mind.  The colors aren’t colors, they’re emotions: neon shame smeared with the oily residue of relief, the lurid colors of cheap candy coating a poison pill.  I’m in a cathedral made of mirrors. Endless reflections—each one a version of me.  A sea of selves.  And every single mirrored me is standing at the edge of the same ledge, teetering on tiptoe, staring down into the gaping mouth of the abyss below, which isn’t darkness, it’s silence—so quiet it hurts.  

There’s a hummingbird trapped in my ribcage. I feel it flapping, desperate.  We’ve all been doing it for too long—pushing off that ledge again and again in tandem, unified in our doomed rhythm. Leaping because the fall feels sweet, like giving in to gravity, like the terrifying freedom of finally letting go.  But it never ends. I hit the bottom, and the silence screams, and I’m right back at the top, breathless, heart erratic, wanting to jump again and again and again, because gravity lies and tells me it won’t hurt the next time. You can forget everything when you're falling.  

And every fall comes with something that softens the landing—gilded pushpins sewn into a velvet floor—but they rip the skin from my soul a little more with each crash.  A flash drive of forgotten memories hides in the pocket of my dream-self's pajamas, encrypted and running out of battery. I reach for it, desperate to patch myself together, but it disappears every time I touch it, like trying to catch smoke in my fists.

That’s what this cycle is. A spiral of engineered surrender.  Temporary bliss, stitched on top of a widening wound. I know it’s wrong. That’s the thing—this isn’t ignorance. It’s betrayal, again and again, even as I watch my own hands tie the noose and call it a promise.  Addiction wears a thousand masks, and the worst is the one that whispers you’re “entitled.”  

And yet I see cracks blooming across the mirrors now. Hairline fractures spidering through the thousands of selves. Maybe that’s the beginning. A sound shatters the silence: a bell tolling from somewhere far off.  Not a death knell—not a funeral. That bell is *mine*, swinging wildly in my dreamer’s soul, ringing because *I* pulled the rope.  

I stop. I stop myself. I yank my dream body back from the edge—not with the gentle hands of logic, but with the tearing claws of instinct. I grip the ledge—my palms bleeding shards of mirror glass—and scream not from the pain but from the *remembering*. Who I used to be before gravity seduced me.  A child who loved the sound of rain on the windowsill, who thought grass might taste of lemon if you bit a blade just right.  

And now the mirrors begin to fall. Each shattering is a verdict. A choice. A confession. A rebirth, screaming in broken light, as the versions of me hit the ground and vanish in clouds of introspection.  

The fall always masked the truth: the ground was closer than I thought. Crash landings taught nothing. The real gift was the ledge. Holding on, even when every molecule begs to let go. The miracle isn’t flight—it’s stillness.  

I wake up shaky, soaked in the swearword-sweat of dream logic. But the bell still rings somewhere, quiet now, still hot in my chest. The cycle isn’t broken entirely—but I saw the chisel at its edge today. And for the first time, my hand didn’t close on the poison pill. My fingers found the bell rope instead.
