I am dreaming.

I am floating, softly, in a turquoise mist that billows and curls, neither air nor water but something in-between. My hands--or what I think are my hands--trail through the vapor, sending silver ripples that shimmer as if they were made of starlight. Above me, the sky is a living canvas, its colors bleeding and blending, magentas blooming into indigos, then dissolving into warm, buttery gold.

In the midst of this shifting beauty, I feel a familiar urge, a hunger for certainty. Shapes wink at me from the periphery—a city made of glinting crystal, a path paved in iridescent stones, faces that vanish when I look directly at them. My mind tries to make sense, reaching for definitions, rules, answers. But the harder I grasp, the more the dream defies me; the path twists, the city dissolves like spun sugar in rain.

But now, as the need for clarity prickles in my chest, I pause. I notice: beneath that urge is another sensation, quiet but powerful—a hum, the pulse of boundless possibility. I take a breath, give myself permission not to know, not to fix, only to float. The mist shivers, delighted, and parts slightly, revealing flowers with petals made of interlocking question marks. Nearby, a gentle wind whispers, “What if?” and laughter spills from nowhere and everywhere at once.

Unanchored by certainty, I begin to dance with the dream. Every step produces new wonders: a mountain that folds into a staircase, cloud-foxes playfully weaving crowns from rain, stories spoken by the rivers in languages I feel more than understand. Questions bloom everywhere, radiant and alive, beckoning me onward. My need to know gives way to wonder—comfort with not-knowing becomes a key, unlocking doors that lead to new, impossible realms.

Here, embraced by ambiguity, I realize: the unknown is not a dark forest, but a luminous garden, bursting with mysteries waiting not to be solved, but to be experienced.
