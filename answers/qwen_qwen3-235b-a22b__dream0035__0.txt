I am dreaming. Or at least, I think I am—I can't remember falling asleep.

Darkness peeled away to reveal a world I've never seen, not strange in the way maps or foreign tongues are strange, but as though reality shifted its axis perpendicular to everything I've known. Trees with blue leaves whisper in the wind, casting shadows which crawl with tiny glowing creatures that chirp like insects and hum in harmony. It rains sometimes. The rain smells like cinnamon and petrichor, and lands with the soft *plop* of something meant to be warm but feels cold when it touches skin.

I’m surrounded. People—terribly human, yet not. Their skin shimmers faintly with a faint bluish sheen, their garments woven of starlight and silkweed. One glacier-blue eye hangs gently above the other, lidded differently, blinking in different rhythms. They speak in layered harmonics, like echoes of echoes, languages folded upon themselves, alive with utterance.

I don’t understand a single word.

Still, I know this: *I must be understood.* So I stumble forward.

The first person—a being with long braids that flow like liquid amber and fingertips that bloom faintly luminescent flowers—stops amidst the cadence of that musical tongue. He watches me, *really* watches, as if peeling back the sounds for deeper meaning. His glances stab through me, curious and knowing.

I swallow hard and do the only thing I can.

I gesture.

I point at my chest. Speak my name, clumsy among their resonance. "I—I'm... *Eli?*" I don't even sound right to myself, normal words amidst a sky made of song.

He tilts his head. Then slowly… he mirrors the gesture. One long arm reaches toward me. His voice emerges as a rounded hum, a slow wave of meanings that rise into trills. He repeats my syllables—“*El-ee?*”—but somehow, he makes it feel like a question and a welcome all at once.

I nod eagerly.

Then... he smiles. Not in a way we would recognize. The corners of his eyes soften and lift; faint spirals pulse along his neck like ancient bioluminescent glyphs stirred by breath. He reaches out and cups a hand around my cheek. The warmth is enormous—as if it came from somewhere deeper than the sun—and it leaves a velvet ringing in my ears.

From that gesture, something shifts.

I realize that survival here isn’t just about decoding their speech. It’s about becoming fluent in *connection*—of touch, of rhythm, of resonance between beings who know each other not by names or words, but by the music they create together. And in this world without shared language, translation lives in the silence between words, in the eye contact, in the steady beat of feeling seen.

He takes my hand, lacing his fingers through mine, and we begin to walk—no destination yet in mind, only the shared step. I don’t yet know where I am. Or if I'm dreaming. But for the first time, it doesn't feel as if I'm completely lost.  

Here, in this radiant chaos of unfamiliarity, I am no longer alone.
