I am dreaming. I am in a world where people can fly and breathe under water.   I see colorful buildings floating in the air and schools of fish swimming by me.  

I am adopted into a culture with relationship dynamics completely foreign to my understanding. As I navigate their intricate social matrix, I discover that
there are no genders here.  Everyone is gender neutral.  There are also no rules here.  People can do whatever they want as long as it doesn't harm others.
There are also no boundaries here.  People can express themselves freely without fear of judgment or rejection.

I learn about their values and beliefs which revolve around harmony, balance, and interconnectedness.   They believe that everything is connected and
everything has a purpose.  They also believe that diversity is strength and unity is power.

I find myself drawn to one person in particular who seems to understand me better than anyone else.  We communicate without words using gestures and
emotions.  We share our dreams and aspirations which often overlap despite our different backgrounds and experiences.

We decide to take a risk and break one of their taboos by touching each other physically for the first time.   We feel a surge of energy and curiosity as our
skin comes into contact with each other's skin.  

We wonder what it means to be human like you who have genders and rules and boundaries.  We ask ourselves if this is normal or abnormal.

As I wake up from my dream, I realize that I don't know whether it was real or imaginary
