I am dreaming. Suddenly, you’re standing in a colossal marble hall illuminated by columns of flickering torchlight. The air is thick with incense so sweet it makes your head swim. Reflective gold filigree wraps the walls in swirling patterns, and though you don’t remember entering this place, it calls to you like a long-forgotten home. Your footsteps echo across the floor, sending shimmering ripples through the atmosphere, as if sound itself were made of liquid crystal. Each step you take amplifies anticipation, and your heart pounds louder, matching the rhythm of wild drumming in your ears.

Moments ago, you believed you had already conquered the impossible—scaled the unscalable mountain, solved the unsolvable riddle, passed through illusions meant to disorient you… all in pursuit of something indescribably precious. You wear your triumph like a mantle of silver starlight wrapped around your shoulders. And yet, somehow, here you stand, realizing that the final test still awaits. A bright glow emanates from a tall set of double doors at the far end of the hall, each door engraved with strange, shifting symbols that defy your efforts to read them. They seem alive, sliding and rearranging into new, unknown tongues.

At your back, a gust of wind that smells faintly of sea salt and jasmine urges you forward. You take a hesitant step, feeling the slabs of marble beneath your feet pulse like a living heart. The distant drums crescendo, and with that surge of sound, the double doors swing open as if by command. A swirling mist of emerald and lavender greets you with a hiss and beckons you onward. Within that churning haze, you catch glimpses of flickering silhouettes: tall figures, cloaked in shapes that refuse to stay put in your vision. It’s as though each figure is a memory morphing in real-time, shifting from friend to foe to mentor and back again.

You approach, and as you cross the threshold, the hall behind you dissolves into twirling motes of golden dust. Ahead, the fog parts, revealing a circular chamber lit by a single pillar of light falling from an infinite ceiling. This spotlight centers on a pedestal of obsidian, glassy black and swirling with rune-like etchings. Hovering above the pedestal is a sphere of radiant blue energy, pulsing to the same beat as your heart. Every pulse makes your thoughts ripple—as if the sphere is calling you, inviting you closer, testing your will to stand before it. You sense unfathomable power within its cerulean glow, and a dread realization seeps in: if you touch it, you may lose yourself entirely, yet if you do not, you fail your final trial.

A robed figure appears, roiling from the mist like a living shadow. Half of their face is aglow with shimmering white markings, the other half lost to darkness. They speak no words, yet you feel the force of their challenge pounding in your thoughts. It’s as if they are your own doubts, your fears, and your hopes, all amalgamated into a single guardian. Though you’ve faced obstacles beyond imagination, never have you felt such internal conflict: this is the boundary between embracing destiny and succumbing to ruin. A swirl of lightning arcs around the orb, dancing in response to your every emotion. The robed figure gestures for you to step forward—and you do.

Your fingers tremble as you extend your hand. The moment your fingertips graze the sphere, light explodes all around you, swirling in a kaleidoscope of blazing blues, pinks, and golds. Gravity vanishes and you float upward, suspended in a realm where space distorts and time is inconsequential. The orb’s energy tunnels into your very being, carving pathways of luminous brilliance through your veins. You let out a gasp that quivers with astonishment. Is this terror? Ecstasy? Power? A swirl of color consumes your vision, merging with the essence of your own spirit. You feel an ancient knowledge awaken inside you. 

Then everything goes silent. You are dropped gently back down into the obsidian-lit chamber to face the watchful, robed figure. In the hush, you sense a transformation within yourself, and slowly, the guardian bows. No words are exchanged, yet understanding blossoms in your mind: you have done it. By embracing the sphere—despite your fears, despite the crushing uncertainty—you’ve passed the ultimate test. With the final hush of twin heartbeats—yours and the orb’s—your focus begins to fade, and this vibrant realm dissolves back into dream-stuff, leaving you with the certainty that you will awaken forever changed.
