I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The air around you shimmers like heat off a summer road, although no sun hangs in the sky—instead, a giant opal eye floats overhead, blinking slow crescendos of violet light. You find yourself at the threshold of a new community: a village of curved, shell-white domes nestled among fuchsia grass. Every step you take, the ground sighs gently, as if welcoming you, but you still feel the knot of loneliness in your chest.  

You move forward, guided by the distant hum of voices—low, melodic murmurs that feel both alien and familiar. Your hands trail along the smooth walls; when you press your palm to the shell-stone, your fingertip leaves a glowing trace, as if you’re writing your name into the world. In that instant, the ground ripples beneath you, and you sense an invitation.  

Feeling isolated and uncertain, you decide to reach out—and you raise your voice in a simple greeting. The words catch in your throat, but as they spill forth, they bloom into bright motes of light, drifting over the purple grass like fireflies. The mote-lights gather, coalescing into a figure: a slender being with eyes of molten gold and wings woven from mist. It kneels before you, offering a handful of seed-like orbs that pulse with tiny heartbeats.  

You accept one orb. The moment you hold it, a warm pulse spreads up your arm, and you understand: this community communicates through shared resonance, each orb carrying a story, a laugh, a fear overcome. You plant the orb in the grass. It bursts open like a flower, releasing a swirl of laughing voices that swirl around you, threading you into this new tapestry of life.  

As the laughter wraps you in gentle light, the domes brighten from within, lanterns flickering on in every home. You realize that even here—on unknown streets with unheard names—connection sprouts from the courage to reach out. And in this dream-village of living song and luminous seeds, you are no longer alone.
