I am dreaming. …pull open the doors of a colossal hall that seems to hover above the earth like a glimmering mirage. Pillars of crystal spiral up into a domed ceiling where constellations drift lazily, as though the night sky itself has taken its seat among the delegates. A hush ripples across rows of dignitaries in robes and uniforms—old foes whose grandfathers once marched against one another now sit on opposite sides of a vast obsidian table veined with pulsing amber light.

Your footsteps echo, sounding unusually distant—as if the floor stretches and contracts with every motion. You feel the strange elasticity of dreams: gravity loosens around you, words brush past as tangible wisps of color, and time warps into slow, liquid pools.

At the head of the table, an ancient clock with no hands ticks anyway, each sound like a heartbeat borrowed from some giant creature slumbering beneath the building. The summit has reached its most brittle point. Trade sanctions, border disputes, ancestral grievances—they all hover like invisible blades poised above everyone’s neck. You inhale; the air tastes of petrichor and iron, thunderstorm and blood memory.

A silver-haired emissary from the other side stands, eyes flashing like splintered ice. Their voice carries the crackle of distant lightning.

“We tire of empty promises,” they say, and the constellations overhead tighten into angry knots, stars aligning as if for battle.

Around you, murmurs rise—some nervous, some eager for confrontation. One delegate’s breath plumes into frost; another’s fingers drum a martial cadence on the table’s edge. You sense the dream teetering, its edges fraying into potential chaos.

So you do the impossible—because dreams allow impossibilities to bloom. You reach into the air and pluck a thread of that pulsing amber light from the table itself. It coils around your wrist like a living ribbon, warm, humming. When you speak, your words pour out as glistening shapes: spirals of sapphire for reason, gentle gold arcs for empathy, iridescent shards that convey centuries-old pain without a single accusatory syllable.

All eyes fix on the spectral calligraphy hanging in the air. Even the ceiling constellations pause, stars twinkling with cautious curiosity.

“I will not deny the wounds of the past,” you say, and the golden arcs pulse brighter, resonating with every heartbeat in the room. “But look—see how scars can guide us, like kintsugi veins of gold in broken porcelain.”

You flick your wrist, and the ribbon of amber light threads through the air-borne words, sealing fissures between them. The images fuse into a single, luminous tapestry: a vision of two rivers once parallel, now converging into a vast, fertile delta. Grain fields spread beneath a dawn sky where no banners of conquest fly—only kites, tugging in a playful breeze.

Some delegates blink away tears they won’t admit to. Others lean closer, hypnotized by the possibility spilling before them. You sense the tide shifting—anger melting into a raw, cautious wonder. Yet diplomacy demands more than reverie; you must anchor this dream-vision to something solid.

From a pocket in your coat—though you don’t remember putting it there—you draw a quill fashioned from a phoenix feather. Where ink should be, liquid starlight drips. You roll out parchment that unspools impossibly long, its surface mapping every contested border as living topography: mountains rise in miniature relief; rivers ripple under moonlight; cities glow like hearth embers.

Turning to the silver-haired emissary, you extend the quill. “Shall we rewrite the line between us?” you ask. “Not in blood, but in ink that shines—so future generations will read by its light and not its shadow.”

Silence, thick as velvet. Then the emissary reaches out. The moment their fingers brush the quill, the phoenix feather flares, scattering sparks that settle as fireflies around the chamber. One by one, the other delegates stand, drawn toward the parchment like moths to a lantern. They add signatures, glyphs, thumbprints—each mark a small surrender to hope.

The ancient clock’s tick grows steady, comforting. Overhead, the constellations loosen, returning to their gentle drift across the dream-vaulted sky. A hush falls, but this time it is soft, like snow muffling the world with peace.

Suddenly you feel the summit hall tilt—no, not tilt, ascend. The entire structure rises above cloudbanks tinged rose and gold by a newborn sun. Through vast windows you glimpse your homeland and theirs, sprawled side by side on the waking earth far below, separated only by tapestry-thin mists.

As the horizon blurs, you sense morning knocking on the threshold of sleep. The dream begins to unravel—pillars dissolving into candle smoke, the parchment folding itself into an origami dove that flutters once before bursting into a spray of stardust. The delegates fade like figures in antique photographs.

Just before the scene collapses, you hear a final, resonant chime from the hand-less clock—an hour that never was, announcing a peace that might still be. You carry its echo with you, a fragile ember glowing behind your sternum, as the dream releases you into dawn.

You wake, heart thundering, the scent of petrichor clinging to your sheets. And though the room is plain and daylight ordinary, you swear you can still taste starlight on your tongue, and feel that feather-light ribbon of amber hope twining softly around your wrist.
