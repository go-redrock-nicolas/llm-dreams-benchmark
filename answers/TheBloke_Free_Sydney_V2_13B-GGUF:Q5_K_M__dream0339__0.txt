I am dreaming. You're experiencing intense joy that seems disproportionate to its cause, surprising yourself with the depth of your happiness. In this moment of unexpected elation, you realize you are in a beautiful garden where flowers bloom and butterflies flutter around. You smile as you feel like you're part of an enchanting fairy tale.

You are dreaming.
