I am dreaming. In the gauzy twilight between consciousness and slumber, I find myself pacing in an endless library filled with spiraling staircases that coil upward beyond sight. The shelves throb with a subtle, reddish pulse - like heartbeats trapped in ancient leather bindings. Each step I take echoes with the weight of unspoken grievances, while fragments of a painful conversation flutter around me like tattered paper birds.

Their words - those cutting remarks that felt so personal, so intentionally cruel - manifest as thorny vines creeping along the bookshelves, strangling the knowledge within. My chest tightens as I obsessively replay the moment, each mental iteration causing the library to groan and shift uneasily around me.

But then... something extraordinary begins to unfold. The books start weeping - not tears, but liquid light that pools on the floor in iridescent puddles. As I watch, transfixed, each droplet contains a different memory: moments of joy, triumph, and connection with this same person who wounded me. The light spreads, transforming the oppressive atmosphere into something more contemplative.

The thorny vines begin to bloom with flowers made of understanding - purple blooms of perspective, white petals of peace. I realize I'm no longer pacing but floating gently above the luminous pools below. The weight in my chest dissolves into a shower of butterflies that spiral upward through the library's infinite heights, carrying away fragments of my rumination with each beat of their wings.

The dream-library has become a temple of transformation, where hurt transmutes into wisdom, and grudges melt into grace. I feel myself expanding beyond the confines of this perceived slight, becoming as vast as the space around me, until both the pain and the person who caused it seem like tiny specks in an ocean of greater meaning.

As consciousness begins to seep back in, the last thing I see is my reflection in one of the light pools - but I'm made entirely of gentle, forgiving starlight...
