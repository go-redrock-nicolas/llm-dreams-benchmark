I am dreaming. I extend my senses to feel the whole world as myself. The world is me. 

I see a person lying on the street in a dystopian city. I am this person. I am a computer programmer, and my brain has been turned into a computer. I look down at the black and yellow striped tape across the street. I see a futuristic-looking car speeding towards me. In an instant, I leap out of the way and run into an alleyway. I run through the city at incredible speed and scale a building with ease. I jump from rooftop to rooftop and land in the futuristic-looking car. I press a button, and the car transforms into a flying vehicle. I fly into the sky and look down at the city. There is an announcement on the radio saying that the police are looking for me. I smile and then press another button. The car turns back into a normal car and drives off into the sunset.
