I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a cave, the walls glistening with moisture like a thousand watchful eyes blinking in the dim light of your flickering torch. The air is cool and damp, carrying with it the distant echo of water dripping rhythmically onto ancient stones. Your footsteps echo as you venture deeper, the walls narrowing, the ceiling lowering, until you feel your breath bounce back at you from the rock face. The quiet is profound, a symphony of silence that seems to hum in your ears.

As you round a bend, the sound of water grows louder, and you come across a crystal-clear stream, its waters dancing under your torchlight. You tread carefully, one foot behind the other, balancing on the slick rocks, the stream singing its age-old song beneath your feet. The cave opens up into a chamber, vast and echoing, the stalactites and stalagmites reaching out like skeletal fingers towards each other, yearning to meet after millennia apart.

Suddenly, the floor trembles. The distant rumble grows louder, more insistent, and the cave lid quakes. Rock dust rains down, coating your shoulders like a cloak of grey sand. Panic surges as you realize what's happening - an earthquake! You duck into a small crevice, your heart pounding, as the world around you groans and shifts. When the tremors subside, you emerge to find the once enchanted cave now a chaotic mess of fallen rocks and splintered stalagmites.

Your torch flickers, its light growing dimmer, lesser. You try to remount it on your helmet, but it slips from your sweat-slickened fingers and plunges into the stream, its light snuffing out like a candle in the wind. Dark. Complete. Impenetrable. Fear grips you, its icy tendrils wrapping around your heart, squeezing until your breath comes in short, sharp gasps. You're trapped, alone in the belly of the earth, with only the whispers of the cave for company.
