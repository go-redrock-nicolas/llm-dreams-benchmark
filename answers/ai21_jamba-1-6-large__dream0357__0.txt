I am dreaming. You're developing a growing awareness of your own mortality after a close encounter with danger.

Processing this existential realization, you drift away from conscious thought and into the realm of dreams, where the boundaries of reality blur into the abstract. There's a peculiar sensation of weightlessness as if every fiber of your being is gently disconnecting from the physical world. You feel yourself floating upward, catching glimpses of familiar surroundings from above, yet they're distorted — edges blurred, colors overlapping, and noises echoing without rhyme or reason.

Gradually, the mundane sights of daily life evaporate, replaced by something dreamlike and surreal. You're in a place that's neither dark nor bright, but filled with a luminescence that feels almost alive. It pulses softly, whispering tales of a world where the laws of time and space have no meaning.

The warmth around you intensifies, and your mind conjures an image of a towering sentinel beneath a sky streaked with hues of cerulean, violet, and faint indigo. It's a forest of unfathomable depth, but not the kind you know in waking life. The trees stretch impossibly high, their branches weaving into intricate knots as if forming a protective canopy against forgotten storms. Beneath your bare feet, moss clings to the ground, springing underfoot, soft and alive.

In this verdant stillness, a melody begins to play. It's faint at first, building into an ethereal symphony orchestrated by unseen hands. The sound wraps around you like an embrace, a mix of melancholic strings, haunting woodwinds, and something more ancient, perhaps the hum of the earth itself.

You crane your neck to peer upward. At the apex of the trees, you see them — a web of golden threads shimmering faintly in the eerie half-light. These threads connect the canopy in a network of impossible beauty, a cosmic maze woven by forces beyond comprehension. You want to touch them, to follow their paths, but they're just beyond reach.

As you continue moving forward, the trees part effortlessly for you, as if recognizing your passage. They bend and sway in reverence or warning; you can't quite tell. But you feel no fear. What remains in your heart is curiosity, awe, and an odd calmness, akin to stepping into a sacred story.

Ahead, a shimmering pool reflects an image that isn't yours. Yet as you draw closer, you see fragments of your essence stitched painfully into the world's fabric. You lean closer, drawn inexorably forward, and the water responds; the surface ripples outward in concentric waves, as if you've disturbed it not with a touch but with your very presence.

You are about to reach the boundary between what you understand and what you do not. The dream trembles. The forest edges and the threads begin to fray. Their golden glow shivers, pulling apart into droplets of light that disperse into the air, each fragment chasing the wind in search of its purpose.

You stand at the precipice, an eternal moment stretching out before you. And then, with a soft exhale, the dream falls apart.

You are awake.
