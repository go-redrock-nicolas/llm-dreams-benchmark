I am dreaming. I am operating a nuclear facility. The lights hum with an eerie blue glow, casting shadows that twist like phantom hands on the walls. My boots click on the cold, metallic floors as I rush toward the control panel, the scent of ozone and burning circuits sharp in my nostrils. The screens flicker with cascading errors—red, pulsating warnings like angry veins pumping radioactive lifeblood. Outside an observation window, a storm rages, not of rain but of radioactive particles swirling like a black dust devil. My hands tremble as they tap emergency protocols, but the touchscreens short out, sparking with blue-white arcs. The cooling systems scream, their pipes bulging like veins ready to burst. I hear a distant, mechanical heartbeat echoing through the corridors—a countdown to midnight. The air tastes metallic, sweet as fear. Then, the control tower shudders. A floor drops beneath me, a trapdoor to hell. I plunge into a void lined with glowing rods, their rods whirling in a silent dance. Around me, the walls crackle with plasma, and a voice whispers in the hum of the generators: "Containment is a lie." The rods slow, suspended in a momentary trance, before accelerating into a supernova of light. The facility implodes into itself, a black hole in the sky where the sun used to be. I wake up, my sheets wet with sweat, the room bathed in the glow of storm clouds outside my window. Morning has never felt more alive, and more fragile, than it does<beginofsentence># AES-256-GCM
