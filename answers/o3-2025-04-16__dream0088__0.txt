I am dreaming. …stagger beneath an avalanche of expectations that seem to multiply whenever you glance away, like hydra-heads sprouting from a single incessant “URGENT” e-mail thread.

You’re in a skyscraper whose corridors are endless, but every wall is also a calendar. Dates bleed into one another, numbers drip like wet ink, appointments flutter loose and spiral down the stairwells like albino bats. Each new priority from leadership detonates overhead with the crack of a starter’s pistol. In response, red countdown clocks blossom on the ceilings—nests of ticking fruit, swaying and ripening toward zero.

You sprint. Your shoes morph into roller blades, then ice skates, then comet tails; still, the hallway stretches. Desks race past like fleeing animals. To your left, a glass door slides open and disgorges a committee of faceless executives whose neckties wriggle like startled eels. They thrust stack after stack of perl-white paperwork into your arms. Every sheet is warm, beating softly—paper with a pulse. When the pile becomes too tall, the floor tilts, and you ride a landslide of documents into a colossal atrium.

There the ceiling is the night sky itself, but the constellations have been rearranged into bar charts and Gantt diagrams. Cassiopeia has been reskinned as a product-road-map. Orion brandishes a glowing KPI. Even the moon wears a pie-chart grin. A disembodied voice—leadership’s collective megaphone—booms across the heavens:

“Add it to the sprint! Need it by EOD! Stretch goal—no resources!”

The stars flicker downward like falling embers, each hot ember another deliverable. They sizzle against your shoulders; deadlines brand your skin in rows of digital clocks. Your pulse syncs to the countdowns: tik-tik-tik-tik. A gale of panic lifts you off the marble floor, and suddenly you’re kayaking through the air on a spreadsheet paddleboard, cell borders splashing like froth.

But panic reaches critical mass and snaps. Everything freezes: the falling embers, the swirling paperwork, even the clocks. You recognize the stillness as the eye of a literal storm—columns of calendar pages spiral all around like white hurricanes, but you’re at the unmoving heart. And in that hush you remember: “I am dreaming.”

In a single exhale, you decide to rebel against impossible productivity physics. You unlatch the satchel of deadlines from your back—its straps dissolve like sugar in rain—and fling the whole burden skyward. The swirl of papers catches, rearranges, and re-forms into giant origami cranes. They beat their wings once, twice, then ascend, hoisting the bureaucratic storm with them until it becomes a distant confetti cloud, glimmering like a slow-motion firework against the dark.

The atrium floor melts into a quiet lagoon of liquid glass. You step onto it barefoot—no ripples, only faint rings of light. Each breath lengthens; each second stretches elastic and generous. Leadership’s megaphone has shrunk to a harmless desk toy floating beside you, chirping a tinny “ASAP…asap…” before sputtering out.

Across the lagoon waits a door fashioned from twilight itself. You push it open and glide into a tranquil night meadow where wild clocks grow like dandelions. When their fluff catches the wind, the numbers scatter—deadlines turned to seeds, harmless and drifting, until even the notion of urgency evaporates.

Fireflies spell a single liberating mantra in looping cursive across the dark:

YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED.

And with that glowing script searing softly on your eyelids, you begin, at last, to wake.
