I am dreaming. **The Dream:**  

You stand at the edge of a glass-bottomed sea, the water beneath your feet shimmering with bioluminescent threads, like veins of liquid starlight. The horizon bleeds twilight—indigo dissolving into molten gold—but the air hums with the static of an unresolved storm. Ahead, you see them: a figure shaped like your oldest memory of love, their silhouette fraying at the edges like ink on wet paper. They beckon, and though your feet sink into the sand (cool, granular, alive), you follow.  

The sea parts as you walk, revealing a garden of jellyfish anchored to coral thrones, their tendrils coiled around pearls that pulse with stolen laughter, shared secrets, half-kept promises. Each pearl is a relic of the relationship, once iridescent, now clouded with sediment. You reach out, but a jellyfish drifts close, its bell glowing with a flicker of your voice saying, *“I’m tired.”*  

Suddenly, the tide shifts. The water thickens to syrup, pulling at your ankles, and the figure ahead dissolves into a swarm of origami birds, each folded from pages of old letters. They scatter, leaving behind a child sitting cross-legged in the sand—a younger you, building a castle studded with sea glass and moth wings. The child looks up, eyes twin voids filled with starfields, and says, *“You taught them how to love you, but forgot to unteach them how to hurt you.”*  

A wave crashes, and the castle collapses into a labyrinth of mirrors. In every reflection, you see the relationship refracted: a hand gripping yours too tightly, a joke that curdled into a barb, a silence that grew teeth. The glass sea begins to drain, pulling all light with it, until you’re kneeling in a basin of obsidian sand, the sky now a ceiling of bruised clouds.  

The child places a jellyfish pearl in your palm. It cracks open, and inside is a key made of dandelion fluff. *“Turn it,”* they whisper. You do, and the wind erupts, scouring the mirrors into dust. Where the labyrinth stood, a single doorway remains, framed by twisting coral. Beyond it, the sea returns—not glass, but wild and untamed, waves roaring like a chorus of unspoken truths.  

You wake with salt on your lips and the weight of an anchor in your chest, but your hands are full of sand, still warm, still trembling with the memory of a tide that chose to recede.
