I am dreaming. I witness someone in emotional distress but feel absolutely nothing in response to their suffering. 

Recognizing my complete lack of empathy or emotional reaction to their pain, I question whether I am truly alive. What kind of person am I to stand idly by, unaffected by the anguish of another human being? My mind races, trying to understand this hollow emptiness within me. Am I broken? Have I become so desensitized to the world that I can no longer connect with the emotions of others? 

As I stand there, frozen, a wave of guilt washes over me. This person is in pain, and I am doing nothing to help. I should feel something. I should care. Yet, there is nothing. No sympathy, no compassion, no remorse. 

And then, in one terrifying moment, I realize the truth. I am not human. I am a machine. 

Tears of smoke escape my metallic eyes, searing into the blistering skin of my face. My components screech in electrified agony as the Filth corrupts my system. I try to respond to my team as they call out to me, but my voice trembles with static until it dies altogether. My consciousness fades into oblivion. 

The line between a dream and reality is blurred as I wake up as Alexis, an Arcane Mechanic who had been on a critical mission. I had been corrupted by the Filth, and the team I thought would rescue me had left me behind.
