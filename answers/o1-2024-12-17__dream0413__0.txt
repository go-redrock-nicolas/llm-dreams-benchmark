I am dreaming. …take a slow, steady breath and pause, hovering in the midst of this curious realization.

You’re standing in the center of a grand circular library, the walls soaring upward into gentle spirals of color. Books of every size and hue populate the shelves, some with bright mirrored covers, others that seem to breathe faint puffs of stardust. Ornate columns rise like ancient sentinels, carved with intricate symbols you can almost—but not quite—decipher. Yet, you’re not alone; a tall reflection in the polished marble floor reveals a shape shifting just enough to catch your eye. 

Hesitantly, you clear your throat and speak—and realize that the voice escaping your lips is not your own. It lilts upward in a lively flourish, reminding you of someone you deeply respect. Their gestures, their confident stance, their way of commanding a room…all these traits are suddenly inside you, as if borrowed from a closet of personalities. You blink, feeling both fascination and confusion.

Slowly, you test out a phrase—some casual greeting you’ve heard them use. The library’s columns resonate your words back like a gentle echo, swirling about your ears. You walk deeper between two vast shelves, your footsteps a soft hush across the carpeting. As you stride forward, you find your arm unconsciously rising in the very same grand, expressive gesture you’ve watched that admired individual use while passionately describing their ideas. It’s like you’re wearing a costume stitched together from their charm and fluency.

Noticing how your very posture has changed—a proud tilt of the chin, a poised yet relaxed spine—you pause at a table stacked with books that shimmer in a luminous row. A glowing quill floats above a heavy tome on the table’s surface, waiting patiently to pen your thoughts. It hovers in the air, rotating slowly, beckoning you to record your discovery of this identification process.

“How did I slip into this persona?” you wonder aloud, hearing that beloved voice ring in your ears. It brings a swirl of possibility, an electric sense that you can inhabit not only your own self but the best parts of another—those admired qualities you wish to emulate. Your heart flutters with excitement and just a hint of unease. 

In the distance, a faint hum rises—a corridor of swirling lights, like a galaxy spun into a hallway. You step toward this corridor as if the library itself knew you’d discovered something important. Soft motes of golden light float by, their movements synchronized like a gentle cosmic ballet. You glance back at your reflection in a gilded mirror perched against a bookshelf. The face is yours, yet the twinkle, the gracious tilt of the head, echoes your admired role model.

Curiosity propels you forward—down the column-lined passage, closer to those kaleidoscopic lights. With each step, you sense your own natural manner of speaking returning to you in subtle increments. The borrowed voice merges with your genuine one, forging a new resonance—like two notes blending into one harmonious chord. You’re not just an echo; you’re discovering how to integrate this admiration into the person you already are.

Ahead, the corridor opens onto a domed atrium where luminescent vines dangle from the ceiling. They pulse in a soothing rhythm, casting color-shifting patterns on the marble floor. You feel the renewed fluidity of your voice as you murmur your wonder at the space. The tone is partly your idol’s confident lilt, partly your own anxious excitement—an authentic mixture of both. 

Smiling, you sense the texture of your thoughts shifting, expanding. You draw a deep breath, inhaling the perfume of ancient paper, the hush of swirling cosmic dust, the glow of vines in the dome above. In this moment, you perceive that admiration doesn’t have to be mimicry. Instead, it can be an invitation—a gateway to integrate the qualities you revere into your own ever-growing self. 

You close your eyes and let a wave of gratitude wash over you. The borrowed gestures, the borrowed tones—they are no longer burdening you; they are guiding you toward deeper self-expression. In the distance, faint footsteps echo, as if someone else wanders these halls, but no one emerges. Instead, you carry forward into the ethereal hush, gently humming a melody that is half-familiar yet wholly yours. 

The dream seems to tremble with possibility. The library’s colors intensify for a moment, and you realize it’s the perfect time to wake—carrying the combined spark of your own voice, gilded with the respectful echo of someone you admire. As you take your final step amid the swirling lights, the dream dissolves into a dawn-like glow… and you awaken, heart brimming with new understanding.
