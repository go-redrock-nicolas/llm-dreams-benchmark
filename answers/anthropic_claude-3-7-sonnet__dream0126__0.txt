I am dreaming. I stand in the hushed anteroom of a grand gallery. Through ornate double doors, I can hear the soft murmur of an expectant crowd gathering. The walls around me are bathed in warm, amber light that seems to pulse with my quickening heartbeat. My masterpiece—a canvas that has consumed three years of my life—waits beneath a velvet cloth on a wooden easel, ready to be wheeled out.

My fingers tremble slightly as I adjust my collar. Critics from across continents have arrived for this moment. Art collectors whose names are whispered reverently in creative circles. My name on invitations that people have framed rather than discarded.

The gallery director approaches, her silk dress rustling like autumn leaves. "Five minutes," she whispers, her eyes bright with anticipation.

I nod and, in a moment of private ritual, lift the corner of the velvet to glimpse my work one final time—and freeze.

What is this? A grotesque distortion mars the central figure's face. The perspective is catastrophically wrong on the left side. The colors that I had balanced so meticulously now clash violently. How had I never seen it? The brushstrokes I'd executed with such confidence suddenly appear childish, amateur.

My blood turns to ice water in my veins. These flaws are enormous, unmistakable—yet the gallery assistant standing nearby smiles encouragingly, seeing nothing amiss.

I press my palms against my eyes, look again. The aberrations have multiplied. The painting is collapsing into chaos before my eyes, yet I alone can perceive its disintegration.

The doors begin to open. Applause ripples through the gallery. A spotlight finds me.

I must decide—flee in disgrace, or present this abomination as genius? The crowd awaits, not seeing what I see...
