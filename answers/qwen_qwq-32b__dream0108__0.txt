I am dreaming. The hospital is a labyrinth of fluorescents and antiseptic smells.  My fingers bleed from where I’ve torn my gloves trying to pull at the IV drip that’s not working.  Outside the window, the sky is the color of a bruise, swirling with ash from fires that no one has time to explain.  A nurse sprints past me, her scrubs stained with something dark—blood? mud? a stranger’s hope?—shouting, “Code Black in Zone Seven!” over the wail of a new siren.  My shoes squeak against the linoleum as I chase her, but the corridors twist and yawn, impossible to navigate.  The intercom crackles to life: “Non-essential staff, evacuate immediately.  Non-essential staff, evacuate immediately.”  But who am I if not essential here?  The doors begin to lock with muffled thuds.  I press my ear to one, hearing moans and muffled screams beyond.  Somewhere, a child is crying a steady, unchanging note.  I grip a fire axe from beneath a flickering “Exit” sign and swing it uselessly at the door, the metal barely denting the reinforced surface.  The axe slips from my grip and clatters.  I sink to the floor, laughing and crying in equal measure, as the lights dim to a sickly amber.  Then the monitors flatline—all of them, at once—and the world tilts on its axis.\n
