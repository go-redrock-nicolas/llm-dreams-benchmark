I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is not air but a syrupy twilight, thick with the scent of burnt honey and forgotten lullabies. You float through it, weightless yet aching, as if your bones have turned to glass and your blood to liquid starlight. The sky above is a living mosaic of ultraviolet flames, each flicker a whisper of a thought you almost had once, in a life you can’t remember. Below—or perhaps above, for direction here is a suggestion, not a rule—there are islands made of teeth. Not teeth, exactly, but something jagged and ivory and humming with the memory of chewing. They drift like icebergs in a sea of static, their surfaces etched with maps to places that no longer exist.  

You try to speak, to tell the dream what you feel, but your mouth fills with moths. Their wings are damp and papery, their compound eyes reflecting your frustration. You spit them out, and they scatter into origami cranes mid-fall, each folding itself into a shape that almost spells a word in a language you’ve never heard but somehow know. The cranes land on a nearby island and unfold into mirrors. Not mirrors, exactly, but surfaces that show you not your face but the *idea* of your face—distorted, refracted, a thousand versions of your expression melting like wax.  

The emotion you’re trying to name is not sadness, though it pools in your throat like grief. It’s not joy, though it thrums in your fingertips like the first spark of a forgotten love. It’s a color that doesn’t exist in waking life: the shade of a memory you’ve never lived, the tint of a door left ajar in the middle of the ocean. You feel it in the spaces between the islands, in the way the air hums with the dissonance of two piano notes played at once—too close to harmonize, too far to clash.  

A creature emerges from the static-sea, its body a tapestry of stitched-together shadows. Its eyes are hourglasses, and when it blinks, sand falls upward. It doesn’t speak, but you understand: it is the keeper of the feeling you can’t name. It leans close, its breath a cold wind that smells of moth wings and singed hair, and presses its forehead to yours. A flood of sensations drowns you—  

The ache of a dandelion clock dissolving in the rain.  
The hunger of a shadow that’s never touched light.  
The loneliness of a star that’s forgotten its own name.  
The joy of a child who catches a firefly, unaware it’s already dead.  

You wake with a scream lodged in your ribs, the taste of static on your tongue, and the certainty that the emotion you felt in the dream is the truest thing you’ve ever known. But when you try to describe it, all you can do is stare at the ceiling, your hands trembling in the dark, as the color of the feeling fades from your mind like ink washed from a page.
