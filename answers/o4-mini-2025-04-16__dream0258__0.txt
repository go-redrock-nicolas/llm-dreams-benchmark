I am dreaming. You are drifting in a boundless chamber of liquid moonlight. The floor beneath you ripples like quicksilver, reflecting the prismatic swirl of a thousand distant stars. Everywhere you look, walls of smoky glass curve and twist upward into impossibly tall arches. Their surfaces shimmer with fleeting echoes of your own face—each reflection a version of you haunted by the same unspoken mistake.  

That mistake sits heavy in your chest, a cold shard singing with potential ruin. No one yet knows what you did: a miscalculation in a crucial report, a mislaid promise that lingers like a dark draft behind your ribs. In this dream-scape, the secret grows into a living thing—coiling around your thoughts, whispering that the moment of revelation draws near.  

Contemplating your options, you pause at the edge of a polished obsidian pool. Ripples spread outward when you reach a trembling finger toward the surface. In the undulating reflections you see two paths: one where you confess, standing alone beneath a flushing sun; the other where you bury the truth, letting the shadow of your error stretch long across all you hold dear.  

A sudden breeze stirs—though there is no door or window to let in air—carrying the scent of magnolias and burnt paper. The smoky glass walls breathe with soft creaks, as if they counsel you to choose. You sense that each path will reshape this dream-world, forging new corridors through the archways of your mind.  

Heart pounding like a ceremonial drum, you gently press your palm against the obsidian mirror. The surface shatters into a million shards of light, and in that fracture you glimpse your next step. Will you piece the truth back together—owning every crack and flaw—or will you summon a silvery wave to wash it all away, erasing both error and memory?  

In the hush that follows, the liquid moonlight dims, and you realize: the dream awaits your answer.  

You inhale. The ripples fade—and with your next breath, you move forward.
