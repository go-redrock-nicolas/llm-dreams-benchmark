I am dreaming. I float through an ancient library that stretches infinitely in all directions, where bookshelves tower so high they vanish into swirling mists above. The air tastes of cinnamon and old paper. Books occasionally flutter past me on delicate wings of their own pages, whispering fragments of stories I almost—but don't quite—recognize.

My fingers trail along spines that glow with soft luminescence, some warm as ember, others cool as moonlight. Each gives off a different musical note when touched. Without meaning to, I'm composing a haunting melody that echoes through the vastness.

The floor beneath me shifts, sometimes solid marble, sometimes transparent, revealing strange oceanic depths where enormous luminescent creatures drift among sunken cities. I know, with dream-certainty, that each creature has lived ten thousand years and carries a memory I once possessed but lost.

Suddenly I'm following a fox with fur like burnished copper and eyes that reflect constellations that don't exist in my waking world. It leads me through narrowing passages where the bookshelves lean in conspiratorially, until we reach a circular room with a ceiling of flowing water that somehow doesn't fall.

In the center stands a desk where a figure sits writing in a book bound in material that seems to be made of solidified time. The figure looks up—their face is simultaneously my own and that of everyone I've ever known. They smile and say something I can't quite hear but somehow understand completely, about patterns that connect all existence, memories that never belonged solely to me.

The ink from their pen flows off the page, forming intricate mandalas in the air that I can step through like doorways to other dreams within this dream, each one feeling more like home than the last.
