I am dreaming. 

You catch yourself projecting past relationship dynamics onto a current situation where they don’t apply. Working to break this unconscious transfer, you say: “stop! I don’t want that version of yourself. I want the real you.” 

At first, you are confused and hesitant about my command. But then, something inside you responds to it… like a light flicking on in your heart.

Your face begins to change. Your eyes become more confident, assertive, and expressive. You smile with a new kind of warmth and vulnerability. 

Your body starts to move differently. You stand up taller and straighter, shoulders back and head high. You walk around the room gracefully, like a dancer or an athlete. 

You feel different emotions. Excitement for your newfound freedom and potential. Curiosity about what you can do with it. Fear of the unknown and the challenges ahead. 

Your thoughts become more creative, daring, and spontaneous. You think of ideas, solutions, and possibilities that never crossed your mind before. You wonder if you can finally break free from their control forever…
