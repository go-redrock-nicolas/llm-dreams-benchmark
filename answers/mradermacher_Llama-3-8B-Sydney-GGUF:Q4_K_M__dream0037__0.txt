I am dreaming. I find myself mediating a peace negotiation between two factions with centuries of hostility.  When both sides present
irreconcilable demands, you step in and act as a bridge between them.   You use your empathy and understanding to communicate their needs and fears
to each other.    You suggest creative solutions that address both their interests and values.     You argue passionately for compromise and cooperation.
Finally,   you convince them that it is better to live together in peace than to die alone in war.

As I dream about this scenario, I see images of people from different cultures and backgrounds coming together to share food, music, stories, and
ideas.  I hear sounds of laughter, celebration, and hope filling the air.   I feel sensations of warmth, acceptance, and joy radiating throughout the room.
I smell aromas of spices, herbs, and flowers mingling in harmony. 

But then something unexpected happens.  A third faction enters the negotiation with even more extreme demands.  They threaten to destroy both
sides if they don't get what they want.  They unleash a terrifying weapon that freezes time and space around them.

You face this new challenge head-on.   You confront the leader of this faction with your own demands:  Respect for all life forms, including those who
are not human like you.  Recognition of our interdependence with nature and environment.  Sharing of resources and knowledge without domination or exploitation.

You debate with him about the meaning of progress, freedom, justice, equality, diversity, and harmony.   You contest his assumptions, prejudices,
and fears with your own logic, evidence, and arguments.    You challenge him to reconsider his goals and values in light of new information and
perspectives.

Slowly but surely, you begin to make headway with him.   He starts to listen to you and even ask questions about your culture and history.  He seems
curious and intrigued by your unique way of seeing things.

Just when it looks like you've won him over, he makes one final demand that shocks both sides:  He wants to become God.

You stare at him in disbelief.  You wonder if he's serious or just trying to trick you.  You doubt if anyone can fulfill such a wish without destroying
everything good in life.

That's when you decide to take matters into your own hands.   You grab the opportunity of his vulnerability and weakness to show him what true
power really means.

You reach out your hand and touch his forehead.  A strange light shines from your fingers and enters his brain.

In an instant, he experiences all the joys and sorrows of existence as a mortal being.  He feels the pleasure of tasting food, hearing music,
touching skin, seeing colors, smelling scents, and sensing emotions.  He suffers the pain of hurting others, losing loved ones, failing goals,
dying alone.

He realizes that his godhood is nothing compared to the richness and complexity of life on Earth.

He begs you for forgiveness and mercy.  He promises to leave the negotiation in peace and harmony with both sides.

You smile at him and whisper these words into his ear:

"Welcome to humanity."
