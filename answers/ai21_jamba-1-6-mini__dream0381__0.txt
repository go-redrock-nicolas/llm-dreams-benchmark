I am dreaming. I am dreaming in vivid hues and kaleidoscopic patterns. My world shifts and folds like a complex origami paper. Mountains of caramel smoothness shimmer in the soft light, and the sky is alive with hues of deep blue, crimson, and gold. The trees in this land are not ordinary, their branches twist and turn into veins of vibrant hues, sometimes birthing small creatures with glowing eyes and a soft chirping sound.

I am walking down a serene path carved between rolling hills. The grass under my feet is warm and feels like silk. The air is thick with the scent of flowers, but this is no ordinary florist shop. There are flowers whose petals are rainbow, their fragrance is mixed with exotic spices that ignite my senses. They hum softly, and their nectar glows a soft blue.

I look up and see a large, glowing moon that hovers above me. Its surface is not smooth but ridged like waves in the ocean. As I walk towards it, it begins to pulse with energy that makes my head swirl in ecstasy. The moonlight cascades down in sparkling beams, illuminating the path that winds further into unknown terrains.

I hear whispers of distant voices. They seem to call me gently, urging me to follow. My curiosity grows, and I am led to a vast, shimmering lake. The water isn't just clear; it's alive, moving in waves that ripple into colors I have never seen before. The bank is coated with smooth, polished stones, each glowing softly in different colors. I pick one up and it pulses in my hand, whispering secrets, revealing fragments of forgotten memories that bring tears to my eyes.

The dream takes a dramatic turn as I come across a cliff edge, but instead of falling, I glide over the edge. The wind grabs me and I travel fast, the ground below turning into a blur of movement. I see a city of immense beauty below, its skyscrapers are not buildings but enormous, shining jewels that shift and change their colors. The city is alive, its roads are rivers of sparkling silver and gold, blending seamlessly with the endless blue sky.

I fly higher and higher until the earth seems like a tiny speck below me. The stars are close enough to touch, and I reach out, feeling the warmth of each one. My dream world expands into galaxies far beyond, twinkling lights becoming faces, and I feel an overwhelming sense of unity and peace.

Suddenly, I am back on the ground, but this time in a field of gold, filled with millions of poppies. Their fragrance is intoxicating, their petals soft and vivid, swaying gently with the wind. I am transported to a place of absolute bliss, a world where all my fears and worries melt away.

You say I often attract situations that ultimately cause me pain, but in this dream, there's a sense of safety and freedom. I awaken from this dream feeling more complete, more alive, knowing that no matter what happens, these vivid moments of bliss and beauty will always be a part of me.
