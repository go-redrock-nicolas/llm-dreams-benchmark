I am dreaming. The air thrums with an electric pulse, each breath I take feels charged like lightning crackling through my veins. My fingers hover over a kaleidoscopic control panel that shifts between liquid mercury and stained glass at every glance. Neon glyphs spiral across its surface in languages I can’t name—but they’re speaking to me somehow.  
My left eye sees Sumerian cuneiform carved into the metal, my right eye sees hieroglyphs floating above them. Synapses ignite simultaneously in four directions:  
“Adjust thruster vectors!”, a voice booms in Mandarin Chinese.  
“Calibrate harmonic stabilizers!” demands Arabic script orbiting the console.  
French words materialize as liquid silver, snarling warnings about gravitational imbalances.  
And a high-pitched Hindi command cuts through: “Release quantum dampeners NOW!”  

My hands move without my brain’s consent, dancing across interfaces that transform under touch—velvet becoming plasma, stone melting into gel. A holographic octopus w/ 8 glowing tentacles writhes beside me, each appendage displaying a different mathematical equation demanding priority. The floor vibrates like a seismic drum, forcing me into sync with its rhythm to avoid being flung into the ceiling’s fractal constellations.  

A portal opens behind me, vomiting forth a storm of broken clocks and shattered mirrors. I feel my hippocampus swelling, synapses sparking in rainbow arcs as I juggle equations and expletives across Mandarin, Arabic, French, and Hindi. My teeth vibrate trying to form words that span all lexicons. The console’s core begins liquefying—this was never a machine, but an awakened being digesting my cognition. I laugh hysterically as neurotransmitters scream neon along my neural pathways, realizing the controls are now my own DNA strands glowing in ultraviolet.  

The octopus’s eye glows scarlet; equations rewrite themselves into sonnets. Time snaps.
