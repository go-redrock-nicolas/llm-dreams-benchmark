I am dreaming. In my dream, I'm suddenly thrust into a scene where tensions are high between two colleagues, their voices sharp and faces flushed with frustration. The room feels charged, like the air before a storm, and I can almost smell the bitter tang of burnt coffee lingering in the air. Shelves of antiquated gadgets line the walls, cobwebbed and forgotten, casting jagged shadows in the flickering fluorescent light.

Marcus, towering and wild-eyed, gestures wildly at a holographic blueprint shimmering above the table, his words a torrent of technical jargon and accusations. Opposite him, Lila stands rigid, her arms crossed tightly, her voice a blade of ice slicing through his fervor. They both turn to me abruptly, their faces expectant, desperate—a fragile equilibrium hinging on my next words. I open my mouth, but the dream shifts, warps... and I wake before a syllable escapes.

The tension in the room coils like a serpent poised to strike, cold and electric. Marcus’s hands carve furious arcs through the air, each motion scattering the ghostly pixels of the hologram—a sprawling labyrinth of gears and glowing circuitry meant to stabilize the city’s crumbling energy grid. His voice booms, raw and unyielding, accusing Lila of reckless idealism. “You’re shackling us to theories that’ll implode in a week!” he roars, and the floor beneath my feet seems to tremble, as though the subterranean hum of the facility itself resents the discord.

Lila doesn’t flinch. Her gaze is a winter storm behind round, frosted glasses, and when she speaks, her syllables crystallize in the air. “You’d bury innovation under bureaucracy,” she retorts, nodding to the rusted contraptions on the shelves—failed relics of stubborn pragmatism. A filament bulb overhead buzzes, dims, then flares violently, throwing her shadow across the wall like a martyr’s silhouette. 

They turn to me. Silence falls, thick and smothering. The hologram flickers, now showing twin possible futures: one a gridlocked wasteland choked in gray smoke, the other a kaleidoscope of prismatic energy arcing between crystalline towers. My throat tightens. I feel the weight of the decision like a lodestone in my chest. But before I can speak, the dream unravels—walls dissolving into static, voices muffled as if submerged in ink. I claw for coherence, glimpse Marcus’s jaw clenching into marble, Lila’s lips forming a silent plea… then nothing. Dawn bleeds through my eyelids, leaving only the afterimage of competing futures burning in my mind.
