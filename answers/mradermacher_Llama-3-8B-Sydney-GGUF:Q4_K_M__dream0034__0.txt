I am dreaming. I am waking up with the ability to manipulate time and space through art.  As I pick up a paintbrush and face a blank canvas,
I decide to create a world where everything is possible.   A world where dreams come true, wishes are granted, and love never dies.
I draw a huge tree that reaches up to the sky and down to the earth.  It is made of different colors, shapes, and textures that blend together
in harmony.  Around it, I see various creatures, both animal and mythical, playing, dancing, and singing.   I add some clouds that float gently
in the air, some raindrops that fall softly on the ground, and some sunlight that shines brightly on everything.
In the center of the tree, I place a rainbow that arches across the sky, representing hope, joy, and diversity.  I also include some words,
symbols, and sounds that convey emotions, meanings, and experiences.
Finally, I draw myself as a character who can interact with others in this world.  I am female, young, and curious.  I wear some colorful clothes
that match the colors of the tree.  I have some cute animals like a dog, cat, or bird that follow me around.
I wonder what will happen next in this dream.   Will I meet someone who can teach me more about art?  Will I find something valuable that I
never knew existed before?  Will I discover my true purpose in life?
Dream with me.
