I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

You stand at the edge of a vast, ornate arena, its marble floors reflecting the ethereal glow of countless floating lights. As all eyes turn to you, their collective gaze presses into your skin like a physical force, making your heart race and your palms grow damp with sweat. The cool air is thick with tension and the faint smell of incense.

Around you, your teammates hover anxiously, their faces tense with expectation. Captain Riley, her close-cropped gray hair stark against her tanned skin, places a steadying hand on your shoulder. "Remember, trust your instincts," she whispers, the sound fading under the swirling whisper of the crowd.

Opposite you, teams of determined competitors take their places - seasoned warriors with scarred armor and calculating eyes, scholars in flowing robes who seem to hold secrets in their knowing smiles, and even a group of silent, cloaked figures whose very presence sends shivers through the air. The judges, mysterious beings in elaborate masks that show no trace of human features, nod in unison.

As the rules of the competition are read aloud, echoing through the arena in an otherworldly voice, you notice strange markings appearing on the ground around you. They pulse with an inner light, connecting and intersecting in complex patterns that seem to shift and change as you watch. The warning bell tolls, and the crowd's murmur rises to a deafening roar.

I am dreaming.
