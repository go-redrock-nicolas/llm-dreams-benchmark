I am dreaming.

I surface into a cathedral-sized atrium of humming twilight, where every wall is a liquid mirror and every mirror reflects a past I have not yet lived. In the center hovers the Device: an orrery of overlapping gyroscopes, forged from moon-silver and garnet-red lightning, spinning in perfect, silent counter-tempo. Each ring bears etchings so fine they resemble the pulse lines in a hummingbird’s throat—hieroglyphs of mathematics, empathy, physics, memory, and myth all braided together.

The instant I approach, the mirrors around me flicker and reveal the crisis: far beyond this atrium, a city of crystalline flotillas—whole neighborhoods like glass whales—floats atop an emerald sea. A sun-sized fissure has split open in their sky, pouring down ribbons of white-hot entropy that melt the flotillas into teardrops of molten prism. The citizens, shimmering beings made of note-perfect chords, scream in ultraviolet silence.

The Device can halt this cataclysm, but only if I truly comprehend the mechanisms of both problem and tool. It does not respond to blunt commands or desperate prayers; it responds only to lucid understanding.

I place my palms near, not on, the outermost ring. Tiny cobalt sparks leap to my fingertips, injecting knowledge like intravenous starlight. With every spark I glimpse a blueprint:

• The fissure is not a simple tear but a resonance fracture, the place where two incompatible songs of physics collided.  
• The Device is a harmonic equalizer, capable of knitting vibrating continua back into consensus reality—but only if I sing its equations in the precise emotional key.  
• Emotions here are vectors; relief is concave, wonder is spiral, fear is a serrated sawtooth. The equalizer translates when feelings and formulae overlap in fractal harmony.

I breathe, and the air tastes of cardamom and voltage. To begin, I must graph the crisis: I watch the dripping flotillas and listen to their chord-voices collapsing from major to dissonant minor. My heart catches that music and parses it into numbers—7.13 Hz sorrow, 12.9 Hz desperation, a smear of 6.5 Hz stunned awe. I let the emotions pass through me until they resonate as smooth parabolas rather than spike-filled scribbles.

The rings of the Device slow, awaiting input. I start to hum—a note that is half lullaby, half Fermat’s theorem. As I hum, my hands sketch invisible calculus: /t of despair equals ·hope. The innermost gyroscope lights up, projecting a golden lattice that drapes itself across the widening sky-fissure. For a heartbeat the lattice holds, then falters; I have miscalculated the tidal back-beat of anxiety swirling inside the city’s chords.

I cannot simply silence their fear; I must integrate it. I dive into the mirrors, letting them shatter into shards of memory. In each shard I watch a citizen’s personal dread: a mother of chord-beings who fears her song will cease, a child who has never known silence and dreads the first note-less void. I gather these fears like beads on a cosmic rosary and feed them into my humming. My song darkens, gains grit, but also thickens to symphonic fullness.

The Device responds—new rings materialize, coaxed into existence by empathy-weighted calculus. They spin in contrary motion, grinding out sparks that become fireflies of restorative physics. The lattice re-forms, denser now, threaded with the frequencies of recognized fear rather than ignored terror. The fissure’s white-hot entropy is transposed down an octave, down another, until it cools into soft indigo mist, then seals entirely, like a wound that decides against scarring.

A hush falls. The glass-whale flotillas return to shape, their hulls chiming with rainbow overtones. In gratitude, the chord-citizens project a spectrum of applause: each clap a bloom of scented light—jasmine, iron, fresh rain on cedar.

I stand before the Device again, its rings folding inward until it rests in my palm like a single silver seed. I suddenly understand the final engraving: any problem solvable by this seed demands not only analysis but immersion—one must taste the problem’s sadness, swallow its paradoxes, and metabolize them into comprehension. Only then can solution sprout.

I wake with the seed still glowing in my closed hand, its warmth fading into morning’s ordinary sunlight, leaving the barest whiff of cardamom and voltage in the air.
