I am dreaming. …I sway between half-light and shadow, breathless, unsure whether the thrum inside my chest is panic or possibility. A voice—disembodied, radiant as struck crystal—proclaims that I am now Commander of the Aegis Task Force, an ensemble of specialists whose résumés read like myths: a quantum cartographer who folds space like origami; a geothermal whisperer who coaxes song from magma; a linguist of extinct constellations; a cyber-druid who gardens in the circuitry of satellites. 

I know none of their sciences. I can barely keep a houseplant alive, let alone steer this star-tipped leviathan of expertise. Yet the moment the title clinks around my neck, I’m standing on the bridge of their mobile headquarters—an airborne cathedral of obsidian glass drifting above a violet sea. Pulsing conduits form neon veins along the walls, and somewhere deep inside the hull, the engines hum Gregorian chords.

The experts arrange themselves in an arc, eyes glittering with cultivated skepticism. Their leader-in-fact, Dr. Hesper Moraine—the cartographer—levels her gaze at me. “Commander,” she says, savoring the irony, “the Wormwood Rift opens in nine hours. We require precise coordinates, strategic vision, and a willingness to sacrifice parts of reality if necessary. What do you bring?”

My mind offers only crude metaphors: a chessboard that keeps rearranging itself, a symphony played in reverse. I feel the dream tilting; I might tumble out of it entirely. Then I notice something: everyone, even the most brilliant, clutches a private tension—shoulders too stiff, throats too tight. They know the stakes, and knowledge has turned to stone inside them. I may not possess their skills, but I can see their fear. And I can name it.

“First,” I answer, voice steadier than I feel, “I bring fresh eyes. You stare so hard at the stars you’ve forgotten to blink. Let me be your blink.”

A flicker of interest. I continue, coaxed by the dream’s strange oxygen. “Second, I bring synthesis. You speak different dialects of genius. I will translate between them.”

Moraine arches an eyebrow. “And third?”

“Third,” I say, stepping forward until the floor beneath me ripples like liquid obsidian, “I bring the absurd privilege of ignorance. I don’t know what’s impossible, so I’ll suggest it anyway.”

Silence stretches thin as blown glass—then a single, reluctant nod.

The mission begins.

We plunge into cloud canyons lit by electric kelp. Below us, the violet sea fizzes, boiling with gravitational riptides. The Wormwood Rift lurks beneath—an umbra in the water that devours perspective, as though someone cut a hole in the fabric of the world and hid it with dye.

During briefing, the linguist stammers over equations disguised as lullabies; the geothermal whisperer argues with the cyber-druid about firewall chlorophyll. Their vocabularies clang like mismatched gears. I interrupt gently, sketching on the air: “Your lullaby has a heartbeat of five. Your firewall garden pulses at eight. Sync them at thirteen; it’s the smallest common pulse.” 

They stare—but the numbers fit. Conversation flows. 

Hours later, turbulence rattles the cathedral-craft. Moraine can’t finalize a map because the Rift’s coordinates slide every time the sea exhales. She curses fractals and smashes a holographic globe. I recall something from childhood: how my grandmother found hidden constellations by tracing negative space, not stars themselves. So I ask Moraine to chart where the Rift is not—the emptiness that frames it. She resists. Then she tries. Suddenly the map stabilizes like a lock clicking home. She looks at me as if seeing me for the first time.

The countdown hits its final minute. The hull windows darken, and the Rift blossoms—petals of nothingness, edges dripping stardust. We must seed a stabilizer probe into its throat; too close an approach will shred our craft like origami in a hurricane.

“Use the obsidian slats,” I suggest. They’re decorative buttresses lining the lower hull. Might they double as launch rails? The engineer protests: “They aren’t rated for kinetic ejection!” I shrug, dream-bold. “They haven’t failed before either.” He blinks, considers, then overrides the safety interlocks. 

We tilt, engines crooning in polyphonic dread. The sea below roars, a choir of leviathans. I stand at the panoramic window, heart hammering pewter drumbeats. My crew—yes, mine now—works with furious grace, weaving their disciplines into a single tapestry: geothermal resonance to steady the craft, quantum folds to shorten the launch path, lullaby-equations to pacify the Rift’s event horizon. 

“Commander, ready!” Moraine calls.

I inhale the scent of ionized salt and impossible possibility. “On three,” I say. “One—two—dream.”

The probe rockets along the makeshift rails, a lance of cobalt light. It pierces the Rift. For an eternal microsecond, the universe inhales. Blackness dims to charcoal; starlight floods the wounds. The sea calms, its violet surface smoothing like wet silk. Alarms fall silent. 

We did not sacrifice reality. We stitched it.

Relief erupts across the bridge—laughter like shattered bells. The experts converge, flooding me with technical triumphs I only half grasp. Someone presses a steaming mug of heliotrope tea into my hands. 

Moraine approaches last. She offers a crisp salute that softens into a smile. “Commander, you led us by dreaming with your eyes open. Perhaps that’s the rarest specialty.”

The cathedral-craft banks toward sunrise, where clouds peel back to reveal a horizon the color of first hopes. I taste the tea—floral lightning on my tongue—and feel the waking world tugging my sleeves. Yet for one more breath, I remain here, custodian of a team whose brilliance scored the sky, proof that audacious wonder might be expertise of its own.

And then, like all dreams, it dissolves into morning.
