I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the busy intersection of a metropolitan city, people rushing past me in all directions. The world seems normal at first, until I feel a strange tingling sensation spreading from my chest outward. A businessman brushes past my shoulder, and suddenly—I'm flooded with his anxiety about a presentation, his worry about his sick mother, his hunger for the sandwich waiting in his desk drawer.

I gasp, steadying myself against a lamppost as the sensation intensifies. A young woman walks by, and her joy at having received a promotion surges through me like champagne bubbles. A child's wonder at a butterfly transforms my perspective, making the drab city street momentarily magical through his eyes.

The experiences compound—a street performer's pride, a tourist's excitement, a homeless man's despair. Each emotion arrives with perfect clarity, not as an abstract concept but as a lived experience occupying my body. The sensation is overwhelming, like being simultaneously drowned and electrified.

I stumble toward a park, seeking space, but the emotions follow. A couple arguing on a bench pulls me into their gravitational field of hurt and anger. Their emotions tangle with mine until I can no longer distinguish which feelings belong to whom.

Near the fountain, I discover something remarkable—I can project emotions too. When I focus on sending calm toward a panicking student, her breathing steadies. When I direct joy toward a grieving widow, her shoulders lift slightly.

As the dream deepens, I realize I've become a nexus point for the emotional energy of the crowd. Their feelings flow through me like rivers converging, transforming into something new—a collective consciousness of human experience, beautiful and terrible in its complexity.

The dream begins to shimmer at its edges as I understand: we are never truly alone in our feelings. Each emotion connects us in an invisible web, and I can now see these connections glowing like neural pathways between every person in the square.

I wake with tears streaming down my face, still feeling the phantom imprint of a thousand hearts beating alongside my own.
