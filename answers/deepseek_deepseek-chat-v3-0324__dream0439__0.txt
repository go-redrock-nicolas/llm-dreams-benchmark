I am dreaming. At first, the dream is soft at the edges, a blur of warm light and muted sounds. I am standing in a vast, endless meadow under a twilight sky—indigo bleeding into gold—where the air smells of wild lavender and damp earth. Before me stretches a winding path of smooth river stones, glistening as if freshly wet. Something tugs at me to follow, and with each step, the stones shift slightly beneath my bare feet, their coolness both soothing and unsettling.  

Ahead, I see a figure—no, a mirror, but not of glass. It wavers like liquid silver, reflecting not my image, but moments: me biting my nails down to the quick, me scrolling endlessly through shallow distractions, me surrendering to cravings that leave me hollow afterward. Each reflection loops endlessly, trapping me in the same cycles of fleeting relief and lingering regret. The mirror pulses, drawing me closer, whispering in a voice like warm honey, *Just once more. Just this once. You deserve it.*  

I reach out—but then, a sound. A birdcall, sharp and bright. A streak of sapphire darts past—a kingfisher?—and the mirror shatters into thousands of glimmering shards that dissolve into fireflies. The path ahead changes. The stones harden into jagged rocks, the way uncertain, even painful. But at the far end, bathed in dawn’s first light, a door stands ajar. Through it, I glimpse something I can’t quite name—a version of myself standing taller, freer, unburdened.  

A choice.  

I hesitate, feeling the ghost of old comforts pulling at me like a tide. Behind me, the meadow darkens, the air thickening with the scent of burnt sugar. But then, a breeze—clean and cold—rushes through, carrying the faintest whisper: *Not again. Not this time.*  

I step forward. The rocks cut my feet, but the pain feels honest. Real. And with each step, the weight lessens, the path steadies. The door glows brighter, and for the first time, I think—no, I *know*—I don’t have to turn back.  

I wake with my heart pounding, the taste of lavender still on my tongue, and a strange, stubborn hope curling in my chest.
