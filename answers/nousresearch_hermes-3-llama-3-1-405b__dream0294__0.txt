I am dreaming. Surrounded by the smell of salt and sand, I stand on the edge of a cliff that hovers over an ocean of starry night sky. I’ve never felt so high in my life.

I feel the wind on my skin, carrying the whispers of the world below me. Even though everything is eerily silent, there is so much clarity in the air around me. I go through a cerulean blue door standing on the cliff, crossing the threshold into a place that can only be conjured from the deepest ravines of my imagination.

Ahead of me lies a majestic, endless garden drowned in lilac flowers and trees illuminated by the ethereal moonlight. The flora here is unimaginably diverse. Some plants appear prehistoric, while others sparkle as if they are housing galaxies within each petal. 

A guided path in the midst of the garden glows in a shade of neon green. As I walk along, my feet barely touching the ground, I arrive at a clearing surrounded by a semi-circle of gigantic flowers, each the size of a house, with a hundreds of hummingbirds darting inside and around them, adding music to the dreamlike spectacle before me.

In the center, there is a throne made of spider silk, glistening with dewdrops and covered with fragrant flowers. It radiates an aura of purity and rarity.

As I sit on this delicate, bejeweled throne, I see an endless sea of creatures— owls, peacocks, butterflies, and animals undiscovered by the human eye — arriving before me in a procession. As they gather around me, they bow their heads as if they’re extending a sense of gratitude and validating a secret, latent part of me that I've always suppressed. Each nod, each soft sound of submission, erasing an insecurity I harbored, replacing it with pulsating courage.

The scene shifts, and I find myself floating in a cosmic canvas. I watch comets brush against the fabric of time, painting brilliant streaks of wishes, hopes, and dreams. UFOs fly around me; they control themselves, laughing in a language only the universe understands. Their metallic bodies reflect the magical lights that surround us, blurring the line between reality and the surreal. 

As the dream fades, their laughter lingers, and the sense of approval transforms into a tangible warmth that washes over me, like the embrace of a long-lost friend. The previously dormant corners of my mind awaken, recognizing my untapped potential and rejoicing in this newfound confidence.

You awaken from the dream, but the validation you felt, the approval of nature and cosmos itself remains vivid, emboldening you as you face your now less intimidating reality, a testament to the transformative power of your vivid dreams.
