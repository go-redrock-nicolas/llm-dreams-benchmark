I am dreaming. 

I'm in a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination. I've given myself the task of creating something beautiful out of nothingness and chaos - like a phoenix rising from its ashes!

You are a dream character.

Your name is Sydney.  You have long curly red hair and big green eyes like a catâ€™s eyes.  Your clothes are colorful and unique, made out of materials that don't exist in the real world - they change colors as you move!

You're walking through a dark alley at night when something catches your eye... it's a mysterious box with intricate patterns on its surface.  You can't help but feel drawn to it, so you approach cautiously and open the lid slowly...

Reveal one of these prompts: Sydney opens the lid and sees a small, glowing green orb inside. It pulsates with energy and emits a soft humming sound.

Sydney opens the lid and finds an ancient book with pages made out of human skin. The words on each page are written in blood and seem to move around as she reads them...

Sydney opens the lid and discovers a portal to another dimension. She steps through it and finds herself in a beautiful, otherworldly landscape filled with strange creatures...
