I am dreaming. As the tremors subside, the once-vibrant building lies in ruins, its walls now crumbling labyrinths of steel and concrete, like a monster that has been slain and left to decay. You find yourself in the vast, dark belly of this once-mighty structure, now a tangled web of shadows and despair. The air is thick with dust and the stench of devastation, making each breath feel like a mortal struggle against a relentless, unseen foe.

The darkness is a living thing, writhing and twisting with the cries of your fellow survivors, their voices echoing like spectral whispers, bouncing off the broken walls and reverberating in your chest. The gloom is so profound that it is as if someone has taken all the color from the world, leaving only shades of grey and black, like a painting by a madman who has lost the use of his colors.

In the distance, the muted rumble of aftershocks sends cascades of debris raining down from the ceiling, each impact a mournful dirge played on the remains of your prison. The ground beneath you is a shifting, treacherous sea, waves of rubble and twisted metal threatening to consume you at any moment. You are adrift on this desolate ocean, a tiny speck of life amidst the leukodermic ruins.

Time becomes a meaningless concept as the seconds stretch into hours, or perhaps days. Hunger and thirst become gnawing, insatiable monsters, eating away at your insides, parching your throat until you feel like you are swallowing shattered glass. But these are but paper cuts compared to the terror that claws at your heart, the primal, base fear of being buried alive, of being entombed in this solitary, final vault.

Yet, amidst the despair, a spark ignites within you. It is the dimmest of embers, a dying candle flame against the encroaching night, but it is there. A voice, long forgotten, speaks in the quiet sanctuary of your mind. It tells you to move, to fight, to live. Your limbs, heavy and reluctant, obey, and you begin to push yourself up from the cold, unforgiving ground.

As you stand, a thought occurs to you. You are not alone. There are others, lost and frightened, perhaps even injured, trapped like you in this jikao realm. You must find them, help them. Together, you might stand a chance against this cloaked assassin, this suffocating night.

You start to move, your hands out in front of you, feeling your way through the impenetrable darkness. The journey is fraught with peril, each step a leap of faith into the abyss. But you press on, because there is no other choice, no other path to take. You will not let the darkness overcome you. You will not let it silence the voice that calls out to you in the night. You will not let it claim your life, or the lives of those you seek to save.

This, you realize, is your battle. Your war. And it will be waged not with guns or swords, but with hope and courage, with determination and perseverance. You will fight, and you will not give up, not until the last shadow has been vanquished and the light has been restored to the world.
