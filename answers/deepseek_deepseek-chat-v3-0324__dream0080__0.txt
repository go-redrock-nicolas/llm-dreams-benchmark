I am dreaming. A great wave swells before me, towering impossibly high until its frothing crest blots out the sun. The air thrums with the salt-scented promise of obliteration. My first instinct is to run – but my feet remain rooted, toes curling into wet sand as the first misty tendrils of the crashing wave lick my ankles. 

A strange calm envelops me as I realize: this is no nightmare. This is transformation. 

The wave shatters against my body with the force of continents colliding. For a suspended moment, I exist as scattered foam – a million iridescent bubbles catching fractured rainbows before... 

I awaken on a beach of black volcanic glass that sings under my bare feet. Behind me stretches the ruined pier of my abandoned ambitions, its broken pilings jutting like rotten teeth from mercury-colored shallows. Ahead, the jungle. Vines heavy with jewel-toned fruits I've never seen before. Bioluminescent orchids pulse gently in the perpetual twilight beneath the canopy, their glow revealing ancient stone steps half-buried in phosphorescent moss. 

The air tastes of crushed ginger and possibility.

Something in my peripheral vision stirs – a great spotted jaguar emerges from the foliage with liquid grace. Its golden eyes hold neither malice nor welcome, only perfect knowing. When it blinks slowly, I understand that my ruined pier was never the destination, merely the departure point. 

Deep in the emerald shadows, unseen creatures chitter in a language that vibrates in my marrow. The jaguar flicks an ear toward the sound, then back to me. An invitation. 

My pulse thrums not with fear, but with the electric anticipation of a wanderer who has just spotted the first landmark on an unexpected, infinitely more fascinating journey. I step forward. The obsidian sand records my passage for only a moment before the tide, in its infinite patience, erases all trace of my hesitation.
