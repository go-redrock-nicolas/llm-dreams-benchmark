I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you—something that feels like the axis on which your entire relationship spins. Their face is flushed, eyes blazing with a mix of fury and sorrow, and your own voice cracks under the weight of words you can’t take back. The air between you hums with static, as though the world itself is holding its breath. You’re standing in a narrow alleyway, but it’s not quite real: the walls are made of shifting murals, paintings that flicker between memories you share—childhood laughter, late-night confessions, the first time you saw each other cry. Now those images warp into jagged, screaming brushstrokes.  

Suddenly, the ground splits open. Not with violence, but with a slow, deliberate grace. From the fissure rises a forest of crystalline trees, their branches humming with bioluminescent light. The argument doesn’t stop. It *fuels* the dream. With every accusation, the trees grow taller, their leaves sharpening into blades. Your friend’s words become literal: when they shout, “You never listen!” thorny vines erupt from their mouth, twisting toward you like serpents. You recoil, but your own retorts—“You always do this!”—summon a flock of obsidian birds that dive and peck at the vines, shattering them into glass shards that rain down, cutting your skin.  

The dream shifts again. You’re no longer in the alley but floating above a vast, inverted city. Skyscrapers dangle like stalactites from a blood-orange sky. Your friend is there, now transformed into a creature of smoke and clockwork gears, their voice echoing from a thousand directions. “You think truth is a single thread?” they hiss, gears grinding. “It’s a knot. And you’re the one who tied it.”  

You reach for them, but your hands dissolve into mist. Panic surges—until you notice the knot. It’s real, suspended in the air between you: a writhing tangle of golden thread, pulsing with the heat of a thousand suns. The dream whispers to you now, softer, urgent. *Untie it. Reweave it. Burn it.*  

You choose to bite the thread.  

The moment your teeth close on the fibrous strand, the world explodes into silence. A silence so complete it becomes a sound—a low, resonant hum that vibrates in your bones. The inverted city collapses like a sandcastle, your friend’s smoky form unraveling into fireflies. You fall, weightless, through layers of memory and possibility, until you land—splash—in a moonlit lake. The water is warm and tastes of salt and honey. When you emerge, gasping, you see a child sitting on the shore. They look up. They have your eyes.  

“You’re both right,” the child says, tossing a stone into the lake. The ripples spell out words you can’t read.  

You wake up with the taste of honey in your mouth and the faint, impossible certainty that the argument was never about the past… but about the future. And it’s not over yet.
