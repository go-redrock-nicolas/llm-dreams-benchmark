I am dreaming. I'm seated at a curved console of gleaming obsidian glass that pulses with living light—streams of data flowing like luminescent rivers beneath my fingertips. The security hub surrounds me in a perfect circle, screens hovering in mid-air, their edges blurred as if reality itself is uncertain here. I feel the weight of responsibility in every breath; each exhale mists slightly in the unnaturally cool air of this sanctum deep within some structure whose full dimensions my mind cannot comprehend.

My hands dance across adaptive interfaces that seem to anticipate my thoughts, manipulating safeguards that protect... something of immeasurable importance. The knowledge of what lies behind these digital walls exists as a constant pressure at the base of my skull—too vital to fully articulate even to myself.

Then—a ripple. A hexagonal pattern on the leftmost display fractures momentarily, reconstituting with an additional vertex that shouldn't exist. I blink, and it's gone. But seconds later, numerical sequences across three different monitors simultaneously reverse themselves before snapping back to normal.

The anomalies accelerate. Security protocols that have remained stable for what feels like centuries begin to waver. A low hum builds in the room—not from any machinery, but as if reality itself is vibrating at an unstable frequency.

I frantically work to trace the source, diving through layers of encryption that seem to lead me down impossible non-Euclidean pathways. The deeper I go, the more the boundaries between myself and the system blur. My fingertips leave trails of code in the air; symbols materialize in my peripheral vision even when I look away from the screens.

Then I realize: the anomalies aren't attacking the system from outside—they're emerging from within me. Each irregular pulse synchronizes perfectly with my heartbeat. Each fractured pattern mirrors the electrical storms firing across my own neurons.

The walls of the security hub begin to dissolve, revealing not the expected outer structure, but an endless landscape of mirrored fractals where each reflection contains a slightly different version of this same moment, stretching to infinity...
