I am dreaming. You drift into a velvet-black sky shot through with iridescent ribbons of violet and chartreuse. Below you, an obsidian lake ripples as if stirred by distant laughter. Each pulse of water sends a tingle up your spine, like tiny bells ringing in a cathedral carved of shadows. Your breath tastes faintly of mint and ozone. You realize, with a gentle shock, that this is a dream—but also a test of everything you’ve been building in waking life: your careful sleep schedule, the steadiness of your morning runs, the calm pride of rising with the sun.

At the far shore, a single lantern swings in mid-air, its flame wavering between gold and sapphire. Drawn by its glow, you step onto the water’s surface as though it were glass. With each footfall, petals of night-blooming jasmine burst from the lake, trailing a heady perfume that weaves through your hair like silk ribbons. In the distance you hear footsteps—soft, measured, almost urgent—matching the steady cadence of your morning jog. You realize they belong to… yourself. A mirror-image wearing running shoes of burnished copper, a hazy silver tracksuit that seems woven from starlight.

Your doppelgänger beckons. In its hand: an ornate glass key, filigreed with constellations you can’t name. “This is the invitation,” it says, voice a chorus of your own hopes and doubts. “The late-night symposium of the Unseen Council. Speak at their gathering, win their favor—but miss your dawn run. Break the cycle you’ve so carefully protected.” The choice pulses in your chest like a frantic drumbeat: discipline or opportunity, habit or a leap into the unknown.

Behind you, the sky deepens to a violet so dark it feels like velvet closing around your ears. Ahead, the lantern dims, as though it knows your hesitation. You bend to touch the key, and instantly the world swirls into liquid color. The air shimmers; stars spiral down to earth, each one a memory of mornings you woke before dawn to run, of evenings you surrendered early to sleep. You feel the tug of both paths: one warm and golden, the other cool and thrilling.

Then the dream unfolds like a blossom. You slip the key into your palm and find yourself seated at a circular table of mirror-bright obsidian, surrounded by robed figures whose faces are pools of shifting galaxies. Their voices rise in a gentle tide, inviting you to speak of sacrifice, balance, the beauty of restraint. When your turn comes, you speak not of rigid schedules or broken promises, but of the harmony you’ve discovered in small, faithful steps. The Council leans forward; silent stars spiral from their hands and rest upon your shoulders, warming you with an ancient hush.

A bell tolls—soft as a heartbeat—and the scene dissolves in a cascade of midnight petals. You find yourself back on firm ground, dawn’s first pink light brushing the horizon. In your hand, the glass key has vanished, but your heart still holds its weight. You awaken with the echo of jasmine on your breath, the memory of your own voice calm and steady, and the promise that discipline and wonder need not be enemies, but dance partners across the space between sleep and waking life.
