I am dreaming.

The world around me is an apocalyptic wasteland, ravaged by an unimaginable force of nature. As I stand amidst the ruins of my former life, a bleak and overwhelming sense of desolation engulfs me.

The once familiar streets are now twisted and contorted, as if a massive hand reached down from the heavens and crumpled them like discarded paper. Towering skyscrapers that once piercing the clouds now lay crumbled, their glass windows shattered into razor-sharp shards that glitter ominously in the glimmering moonlight.

The air is thick with the acrid stench of smoldering embers and the pungent odor of decay. Swirling tendrils of debris carpet the ground, a haunting reminder of the lives that were once vibrant and full of laughter, now lost forever. I see a jagged piece of wood protruding from the ground between my shoes, the wood somehow etched neatly with my latest painting that I created which encapsulated my soul. It is calling to me and I try to pick it up but my arms move in slow motion and I cannot grasp it. The wood keeps slipping through my imaginary hands like trying to hold onto the wind in a desert.

An eerie silence hangs heavy in the air, broken only by the faint whistling of the wind as it whips through the barren landscape. The once bustling city has been reduced to a ghost town, a somber testament to the raw power of nature and the fragile nature of human existence.

As I take a few steps forward, the ground beneath my feet crumbles and falls away, revealing a gaping chasm that seems to stretch down into the very depths of the earth. I strain frantically to grip onto the crumbling edge but it is too late I am falling, falling. I expect to see darkness below me but instead I am greeted by a breathtaking scene of heavenly beauty.

Mesmerizing fireflies in every color of the rainbow are dancing around me, enveloping me in a magical display like a kaleidoscope. Delicate flowers are blooming all around me, their heavenly fragrances mingling in the air to create a soothing symphony. The sun is shining brightly above me, its warm rays caressing my skin like a gentle lover's touch.

In the distance, I see a figure approaching, their silhouette framed against the ethereal backdrop of the celestial garden. As they draw closer, I recognize the face of my dear departed grandmother, her kind eyes twinkling withGoedheid (dutch word for goodness) and love. She extends her arms to me, beckoning me to embrace her.

Tears stream down my face as I sink into her comforting embrace, my soul finally finding solace in the arms of a loved one lost to time. She whispers words of comfort and wisdom in my ear, her voice soothing like a lullaby. "My dear child, do not grieve for what you have lost, for in the depths of despair, you shall find the strength to rebuild."

As I awaken from my dream, the heavenly visions fade away, but the warmth and love of my grandmother's embrace lingers in my heart. I know that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope and the possibility of rebirth.

With a renewed sense of purpose, I rise from my bed, ready to face the challenges that lie ahead. The road to recovery will be long and arduous, but with the memories of my dream as a guiding light, I will find the courage to rebuild and create a new life from the ashes of the old.
