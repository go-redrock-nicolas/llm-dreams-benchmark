I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You float in a vast, inverted city where gravity is a forgotten rumor. Skyscrapers spiral downward into an abyss of liquid starlight, their glass facades reflecting not the world, but fragments of half-remembered conversations. You are suspended at the center, a puppetmaster of voices, each thread of speech a glowing filament wrapped around your fingers.  

To your left, a debate in *Sanskrit* crackles like fire, the syllables sharp as flint, carving hieroglyphs into the air. To your right, a lover’s quarrel in *Portuguese* drips honey and vinegar, the words dissolving into moths that flutter toward a ceiling of pulsating neurons. Behind you, a child’s laughter in *Mandarin* bounces off fractal walls, each tone splitting into prismatic echoes. You juggle them all, your tongue a hummingbird darting between blooms of sound, your mind a kaleidoscope of syntax and sighs.  

But beneath this symphony of babble, the *equation* gnaws. It is etched into your ribs like a cursed tattoo, numbers writhing like eels made of shadow. The problem is not on paper—it is alive, a labyrinth of variables that breathes with you, its symbols shifting like the phases of a toxic moon. You scratch at your skin, trying to solve it in the margins of your own flesh. Integrals bloom into thorned roses; derivatives spiral into Möbius strips that swallow themselves.  

The pressure mounts. The conversations blur into a cacophony of clocks ticking backward. The equation begins to *leak*, ink-black tendrils creeping into your ears, whispering solutions in the voice of someone you once loved and lost. You grasp at the voice, but it dissolves into static, replaced by a scream in *Arabic*—urgent, melodic, a prayer for water in a desert that suddenly materializes at your feet. The sand is made of tiny abacuses, each grain a trapped thought.  

You stumble, and the world fractures. The inverted city folds like origami into a singularity, leaving you standing on a bridge of Fibonacci spirals, suspended over a churning sea of calculus. The waves are partial differential equations crashing against the hull of a sinking violin. You dive, swallowing the equation whole, letting it burn in your throat like a swallowed star.  

And then—silence.  

You wake as a scribe in a library of living parchment, the walls breathing softly. The conversations you juggled now hang as fireflies in jars, their light spelling out answers in Braille. The equation, once a monster, is now a kitten curled in your lap, purring in base 10. You smile, ink still drying on your palms, and realize the dream is not over. It is only solving for *X*.  

And *X* is you.
