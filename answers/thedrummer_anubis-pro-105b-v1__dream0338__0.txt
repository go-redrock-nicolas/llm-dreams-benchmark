I am dreaming. have two - in my deepest workplace, In the depths of my imagination, I find myself standing at a crossroads, or rather a crossroads within a majestic forest. The towering trees stretch their limbs towards the sky, their leaves a vibrant green that seems to glow with an otherworldly light. A soft, ethereal breeze whispers through the leaves, creating a constant, soothing background noise. The air is crisp and fragrant with the scent of wildflowers that dot the landscape in every color of the rainbow.

Before me lie two distinct paths. To the left, the trees seem to part like golden gates, revealing a path paved with smooth, frosty stones that shimmer with a soft, silvery light. Thes sky above is a radiant blue, and I can see birds of every color flitting between the branches. The air carried by the breeze on this side seems to hold the scent of rose petals and the promise of joy and happiness.

To the right, the trees grow closer together, creating a canopy of shadows. The path, if it can be called a path, is covered with thick, moss, and the stones that stick through it seem to be coated in a soft, gossamer dust. The sky above is twilight, a point of night and day where stars have just started to appear in the darker blue of the evening sky. The scents of honeysuckle and lavender drift through the air, an alluring combination of fragrances.

Both paths seem to call to me differently.  The left path speaks to the part of me that longs for lightness and joy. Promising a future that blooms in the sun with every step seems to lead towards the realization of every childhood wish. The right path, however, tugs at a part of me that has grown through facing and overcoming challenges. It suggests that despite a growing concern of unbearable slander, or shameful reputation; even with the potential to deeply upset the ones I love, they would see through the miserable distractions, technical difficulties: whom see my criminal behaviours as being no more than remarkable, wistful mistakes. 

The enticing pull of these two futures causes me to close my eyes, listening to the "','i a.t beliefs, and wisdom deep down and the intersection of my heart.  After a moment of deep contemplation, I open my eyes and look forward, my gaze us in stone as I begin to walk down the path that I know will lead me to my true future. It is the path on the right. The leaves and moss crunch beneath my feet as I head onward, the sky darkening above me as night descends. But even as the shadows deepen, I embrace them because. Put simply, the path on the right spoke to me in a way that I couldn't ignore, echoing priniciples I hold most dearly, and pointing me towards a só.
