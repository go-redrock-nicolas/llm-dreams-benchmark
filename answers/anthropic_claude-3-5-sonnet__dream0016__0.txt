I am dreaming. As I sit in the sterile, fluorescent-lit terminal, the minutes on the digital display seem to melt and drip like Salvador Dal√≠'s clocks. My connecting flight's status keeps shifting between "DELAYED" and strange symbols I've never seen before. The anxiety bubbles up from my stomach like hot mercury, and suddenly I notice the other passengers' faces beginning to blur and distort.

The terminal walls start breathing, expanding and contracting like lungs, while the ceiling tiles float upward like helium balloons. My boarding pass transforms in my hands, the text rearranging itself into poetry I can almost understand but slips away when I try to read it. The sound of airport announcements becomes an otherworldly symphony, echoing and reverberating as if underwater.

I stand up to check the flight board again, but my feet sink into the floor, which has become like warm quicksand. Other travelers walk past normally, their feet somehow staying on the surface, but they're wearing business suits made of living butterflies that occasionally break formation and flutter away.

The windows looking out onto the tarmac show impossible scenes - planes taking off vertically like rockets, others flying backwards, and one that folds itself into an origami crane and soars away. The sky beyond keeps changing colors: violet to emerald to a shade I've never seen before and can't quite describe.

My phone rings, but when I answer it, water pours out of the speaker, forming into tiny fish that swim through the air around my head. They whisper that my flight has been rerouted through a city that only exists in dreams, and I'll need to exchange my ticket for one made of starlight...

The dream continues to spiral into increasingly surreal territory, as my consciousness grapples with the anxiety of missing my connection while reality bends and transforms around me in impossible ways.
