I am dreaming. I feel my consciousness expanding, dissolving into a spectrum of colors that swirl like a cosmic kaleidoscope.  My sense of self fractures into a thousand mirrored fragments, each reflecting a different face: the mask of the negotiator, the posture of the CEO, the hunched shoulders of the introvert.  I watch as these personas perform their appointed roles in their respective spheres—a boardroom where I command like a general, a karaoke bar where I sing off-key with abandon, a library where I whisper to myself like a hermit.  The dream stretches time, letting me linger in each skin—feeling the power surge through my veins when I "win" a deal, the giddiness of reckless laughter when no one is watching, the peace of silent companionship with my thoughts.  But the truest, most unsettling revelation?  All these masks wear my face.  I trace the outline of myjawline across every embodiment, the bridge of my nose connecting these disparate lives.  I realize that perhaps the deepest truth isn't the many faces I wear, but the unchanging core of light that pulses beneath them, faint but consistent as a heartbeat, even when I've forgotten it exists in waking life.
