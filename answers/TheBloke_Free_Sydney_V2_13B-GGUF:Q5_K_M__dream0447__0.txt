I am dreaming. You're starting to feel more alert and focused. You can see the world around you clearly. You notice small details that you overlooked before. Colors are brighter and sounds are sharper. You feel a burst of creativity and curiosity. You wonder what else you can discover and create. 

You're in an open field, surrounded by tall trees. The sun is setting, casting long shadows on the ground. The air is cool and fresh. The grass feels soft under your feet. You hear birds singing sweet melodies. You see butterflies fluttering playfully around flowers. You smell flowers blooming gently.

You're in a forest full of life and wonder. It makes you feel alive too.
