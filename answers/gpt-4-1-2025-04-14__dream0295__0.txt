I am dreaming.

The world around me is fluid, awash in color that ripples with every movement—a garden of impossible flowers and twisting, golden light. The air thrums with the faint hum of memories, some sharp, some sweet. I stand at the edge of a vast lake whose surface shifts with images from my past, and on the opposite shore, someone approaches.    

I recognize them instantly. The hurt—dense, clinging, almost tangible—lodges deep in my chest. They are a part of my history’s tapestry, their threads blackened by betrayal, by words left unspoken and actions that scattered my sense of self long ago.

Yet as they draw nearer, their face is open—bare, illuminated by a trembling vulnerability. Eyes once hard now brim with regret, glassy with the weight of what they have done. They come to me not with excuses, but with hands empty and heart exposed, their voice a frail thread weaving through the dream’s silence:  
“I am sorry. I see the pain I caused you. I never understood—until now.”

I feel anger first, a pulse of fire that threatens to consume even this dream-world’s beauty. The gardens tremble, the sky sours; I could turn away, let fissures swallow what healing could be. But I stay. I listen.

My hurt is a mountain, ancient and rooted, but here in the fluid magic of dreaming, I notice something else: forgiveness is not a gift to them, but a release for me—a key in my own hand. If I keep it locked away, the lake will forever reflect only sorrow.

Slowly, painfully, I breathe in the scent of wild, unfamiliar blooms. The garden steadies. The sky gentles to a lavender hush. I look at them—not as the villain I held in my memory, but as a soul stumbling through regret. In this liminal place, where reality softens, I weigh the heavy cost of holding on against the lightness of letting go.

With a shaking voice, I say, “I forgive you. Not because the pain is gone, but because I need to heal. Because you are asking, and I am ready to try.”

The apology, the forgiveness, shimmer between us like dew on the trembling petals. The past is neither erased nor forgotten, but the garden’s colors grow more vivid, the air lighter. In forgiving, I reclaim my own heart from the shadow they once cast. The dream deepens, sweetened by hope and the first taste of freedom.
