I am dreaming. I walk slowly down a darkened hallway, illuminated only by pale beams of amber light streaming through small circular windows on either wall. My footsteps echo ominously against the stone floor. All is quiet except for the faint hum of an unknown energy source emanating from the end of the corridor. I turn a corner and find myself face-to-face with a massive pair of steel doors, each adorned with intricate designs that pulse with light as if alive. The doors swing open slowly of their own accord, revealing a cavernous chamber filled with swirling fog that seems to come alive, twisting and writhing like a sentient being. At the center of the room, beneath a soft blue glow, is a delicate glass object—a tiny, intricate sculpture of a bird, its wings spread as if ready to take flight. A cold breeze blows through the door, causing the metal framing around the glass to hum softly like a distant siren. 

A lone figure materializes out of the mist, standing with their back turned toward me. Their silhouette flickers oddly, as though cast by a light source from some other world. 

"Are you ready to try again?" The voice echoes softly across the room. It's like the gentle lapping of waves against a shore, but beneath it vibrates menace, sharp and biting. I squint into the fog trying to make out the person's features, but they remain as indistinct as the swirling vapor that surrounds us. 

"Yes," I reply, not realizing until it's audible that my throat feels suddenly very dry. My heartbeat grows louder in my ears as I continue moving forward. 

A sudden gust of wind blows through the chamber, causing my hair to whip violently around my face and my clothes to billow in the sudden motion. My vision is blurred briefly, and when my eyesight returns to normal, I find myself alone in the chamber once again. The glass bird is gone. In its place is a pedestal made of black, charred stone, a faint aura of electricity ever so faintly crackling along its edges. 

"The real test is whether you can master this… before it masters you." The voice speaks once more, now a whisper that seems to come from everywhere at once. I try to speak, but the words refuse to form. My tongue feels heavy, my mind a jumble of conflicting emotions of fear and anticipation.

The lights dim even further, leaving me in almost total darkness except for the faintly glowing pedestal. The faint aura grows brighter, spreading outward from the center into a pulsating orb of pale violet light. My pulse races with excitement and uncertainty. I reach forward and place my hands on the cold stone, expecting my flesh to burn against it, but instead it's like I can feel it breathing beneath my fingertips— sapient, hungry. I hold my breath and listen. 

There’s nothing. Just the soft whisper of the foggy mist and my own frantic thoughts. I step closer, brace myself for the inevitable explosion of chaos that I know will come. The energy in the room shifts violently, causing the air to crackle with static as my hands make contact with the pedestal. My heart stops for the briefest of moments as I watch the eerie purple glows extend from the pedestal into my hands, seeping into my skin like a slow-spreading poison. My vision blacks out momentarily. When it returns, I am surrounded by static. I am no longer standing in the misty chamber. 

Instead, I find myself standing atop a crumbling bridge suspended miles high over an endless chasm of darkness. My heart freezes for a moment as I see the bridge beginning to disintegrate beneath my feet. My hands instinctively reach for the stone pedestal in front of me but grasp nothing but air. 

The orb of violet light reappears, this time floating just inches from my face. As it grows brighter, the fog around me becomes more chaotic, creating eerie, warping shadows that seem to scream silently into my mind. My feet slip suddenly, and I realize with a deep, hollow fear that I am falling. 

The void around me widens, engulfing the bridge in its final moments. 

Suddenly, I'm falling, weightless and helpless, my stomach lurching into my throat. My arms flail wildly as I try to grasp onto anything, but there is only open air and cascading mist. My scream is lost to the rushing wind as it tears at my throat, an endless waterfall of terror. I reach out desperately with both hands, bracing for the inevitable impact, but instead of hitting the ground, my body is swallowed into the blinding absence of light, consumed by darkness. 

I lie there for what feels like an eternity in complete silence, paralyzed by an unseen force. Slowly, I become aware of the warmth slowly creeping back into my body. My eyes blink once, twice, before I stand up, my surroundings still cloaked in utter blackness. The eerie violet light reappears beneath my feet, slowly spreading outward like a growing flame. I feel a strange warmth in the pit of my stomach, tingling in my fingertips. The mist is gone. The pedestal is gone. Nothing remains but the glowing light beneath my feet, pulsating in sync with my heartbeat.

I glance down at my palms, glowing with the same violet light, and a flicker of deep discomfort flares within me. 

There are no more words spoken. My heartbeat races with adrenaline and terror as I realize that I have no clue where I am—or where I'm going next. The glow beneath my feet grows brighter, more unyielding, as I step forward into the unknown.
