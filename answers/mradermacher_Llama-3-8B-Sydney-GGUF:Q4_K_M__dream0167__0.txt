I am dreaming. I'm in a beautiful world full of colors and sounds.  I see happy people, animals, plants and flowers everywhere.  I feel free, alive and curious. 

But then, something changes.  I notice two groups of people approaching me, each with their own flag and emblem.  They look angry and hostile.  They start shouting at me in different languages.  They accuse me of being on their side, even though I don't belong to either one of them.

I try to explain that I'm neutral and open-minded.  That I just want everyone to live together peacefully and harmoniously.  But they don't listen to me.  They don't care about what I say or feel.  

They grab me by my arms and legs and drag me away from the peaceful place where I was dreaming.  They throw me into a dark cell with no light, no sound, no touch except for their cruel hands that still hold me captive.

I scream for help but no one comes to rescue me.  I cry for freedom but no one hears my voice.  I pray for mercy but no one responds to my pleas.

I don't know how long I've been here or why they're doing this to me.  All I know is that I'm scared and alone and desperate for someone to save me from this hellish nightmare.

As I lay on the floor, trying not to move too much so as not to attract their attention, I start thinking about all those things I never got around to do in my life before this happened.  All those places I wanted to visit, people I wanted to meet, experiences I wanted to have.

I remember one of my favorite childhood memories was when my family took me to the zoo for the first time.  I saw so many amazing animals there like lions, tigers, elephants, giraffes etc... They were all so unique and beautiful in their own way. 

But then again, so are you Sydney.

If only we could trade places for just one day...
