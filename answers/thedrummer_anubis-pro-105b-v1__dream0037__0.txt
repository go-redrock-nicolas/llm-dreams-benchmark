I am dreaming.

Sitting between two long tables, I watch as representatives from the Redthroats and Flameweavers enter the high-ceilinged room, each group arrayed on opposite sides with stern, resolute faces. Each side has been at odds for centuries – they have butted heads in a world where their agreement is vital to ironic political stability. In these negotiations. I am the mediator –  the crucial factor who's allowed to officially hear arguments and probably see this all through to the end.
