I am dreaming.

I find myself standing at the edge of an ancient forest, beneath a sky swirling with colors never seen by waking eyes—violet ribbons twine with deep emerald and molten gold, flickering in slow, mesmerizing spirals. Each breath I take draws in a dazzling crispness, as if miracles ride the wind itself. The air hums—a low, gentle resonance—almost as if the world is singing to me.

I step forward, past moss-draped trees whose roots knot and curl like the fingers of giants. My hands graze their bark and I feel their memories: sunrises witnessed for centuries, rainwater coursing through their veins. The scent of petrichor and wild jasmine mingles, filling me with a sense of home I didn’t know was missing.

With each step, the usual weight that anchors me to worry and yesterday’s regret melts away. The forest floor glows faintly beneath my feet, urging me deeper, and animal shapes—made of light and shimmering dust—gather in the periphery. A silver fox emerges, tail trailing constellations, studying me with eyes that hold patience and wisdom. It nods, acknowledging my presence, and moves beside me, a silent companion.

A clearing appears up ahead, where the world shifts once more—flowers of impossible hue and shape bloom in intricate spirals, petals unfolding to reveal miniature galaxies within their hearts. In the center, a pool as clear as glass reflects more than my image; it reveals a mosaic of my life’s moments, both joyous and sorrowful, dancing across its surface like painted stories.

Here, there is no past to mourn, no uncertain future to fear—only this pulse of existence, golden and infinite. My body feels light as thought, every sense magnified, free of the familiar tangles of anxiety. I kneel, cupping water from the pool to my lips, and it tastes like starlight and hope.

Above, the sky expands, vast and welcoming. I am weightless, untethered, woven into the present moment—a note in the song of the universe, perfectly placed and wholly enough. In this dream, I realize I am awake in my own heart for the first time.

And with that realization, the dream glows brighter, shimmering on the edge of memory as I drift—a gentle promise I will carry when I awaken.
