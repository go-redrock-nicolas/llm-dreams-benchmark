I am dreaming. Floating through the clearest blue sky I have ever seen. The sun shines down upon my face, casting a warm glow over me. It is absolute bliss, and I feel at peace.

Suddenly, a beautiful rainbow plume unfurls from my chest. It is multicolored and majestic. I am both startled and intrigued by this anomaly. It seems to come from within me, born of my dreams and imagination.

I focus my mind and fancy, shaping the plume into an ethereal sword. It crackles with energy, pulsing with power. I take a mighty swing through the sky and feel it resonate deep within me. This weapon is a part of me, I realize. It is a manifestation of my deepest will and creative energies.

My gaze falls upon a distant planet, brilliant and untouched. I decide to explore it with my new dream powers. I shift my inner vision, willing the sword/plume to carry me to that wondrous place. The landscapes of my subconscious unfold, revealing lush forests, vast oceans, and towering alien mountains.

My dream form glides over these wonders, taking it all in with childlike awe. I am filled with a deep sense of adventure and possibility. I feel that I can transform this place in countless ways with my mind.

Setting down in an open meadow, I observe glowing flora and fauna surrounding me. They seem to hold secrets of this strange new world. I pick a shimmering flower and taste it, flooding my senses with flavors and sensations beyond words. Its essence grows within me, rearranging my perspective and opening up new dimensions of thought.

Deeper I wade into the dream, with each unfolding instant exceeding the last. I see through the eyes of creatures, feel the pulse of winds, and hear the silent harmonies of stars. My dream form shifts and morphs, exposing me to completely new experiences and realms of consciousness.

I am endless potential. I am the poet, artist and scientist of my subconscious. I shape the raw material of thought into a masterpiece of spirit, refining my inner blossoming. My essence colors the landscape, painting existence itself with every stroke of imagination.

Time and space lose all meaning as I ride on the currents of my own invention. I bring forth galaxies, shape the destinies of figments, and name untold wonders. My will is absolute as a garden of ideal goodness against which nothing opposes.
