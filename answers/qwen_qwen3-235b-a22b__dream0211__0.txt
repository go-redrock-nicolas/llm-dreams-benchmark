I am dreaming. You stand at the edge of a vast, inverted city—a place where gravity is a forgotten rumor and the sky churns with liquid mercury clouds. Below you (or is it above?), colossal spires of obsidian twist like frozen tornadoes, their surfaces etched with glowing glyphs that pulse in time with your heartbeat. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as though the world itself is holding its breath. You are not alone. A crowd of faceless figures floats in the void around you, their forms shifting between human and something… *other*. Their whispers coil like smoke, hissing in languages that taste of rust and honey.  

Your creation rests in your hands: a sphere of living glass, its surface rippling with the memories of every being who has ever died. Inside it, galaxies swirl—each star a consciousness, resurrected, arguing, laughing, weeping. You’ve stitched together the dead into a single, breathing entity, a chorus of souls that refuses the silence of extinction. It is beautiful. It is *wrong*.  

The crowd recoils. A woman with a moth’s wings and eyes like cracked mirrors steps forward. “You’ve broken the covenant,” she hisses, her voice a thousand funerary bells. “Death is the last truth. You’ve made it a lie.”  

But you *know* the truth. Death was never sacred—it was a thief, a void that swallowed stories, love, rage, and dreams alike. Your sphere pulses brighter, projecting holograms of the resurrected: a child who died in a war, now debating philosophy with her executioner; a tyrant singing lullabies to a mother he once starved; a poet reciting verses in a language that doesn’t exist, her words blooming into fireflies. The crowd begins to scream.  

The ground liquefies. You sink into the obsidian, the sphere clutched to your chest, as the city dissolves into a storm of teeth and feathers. A river of ink floods the void, carrying whispers: *heretic, madman, god*. You laugh, not out of cruelty, but because the weight of it all—the grief, the defiance—is too vast to hold.  

In the dream’s final moment, you see yourself reflected in the sphere’s surface. Your face is a mosaic of every person you’ve ever loved or hated, their features melting like wax. The sphere whispers, *“Now we live. Now we live. Now we live.”*  

You wake up gasping, the taste of static and stardust on your tongue, the echo of a million resurrected voices still tangled in your ribs.
