I am dreaming. I am drifting through an endless courtyard bathed in lantern light. Tall marigold garlands arc overhead, their golden petals whispering in a warm breeze scented with cinnamon and copal incense. At my feet, a mosaic of papel picado sways: delicate skeletons dancing in intricate cut-paper patterns. I realize I’ve stumbled into a Día de los Muertos celebration—so alive, so achingly beautiful—yet it feels as though it has always belonged to the very core of me.

Soft guitar chords begin to rise, and I follow the melody into a narrow alley where calavera musicians play beneath a sky embroidered with constellations. Each string pluck vibrates inside my chest, calling up memories I’ve never lived: the laughter of ancestors, the comfort of candlelit altars, the gentle murmur of prayers passed down through generations. A child skeleton, painted in rose and turquoise, extends a bony hand. I take it, and suddenly I am spinning—my own hands streaked with paint, decorating sugar skulls with swirls of scarlet and jade.

Everywhere, faces glow with painted smiles, each one a portal: a grandmother’s lullaby drifting from somewhere beyond this world, a grandfather’s journey across deserts to build a new home, the fierce pride of mothers weaving flower crowns. I taste pan de muerto—sweet, pillowy bread dusted with orange sugar—and tears mingle with laughter as I understand: grief and joy are not opposites here, but partners in a heartfelt dance.

When I awaken, the echo of that guitar, the flicker of marigold petals, and the warmth of countless candles travel back with me. I carry them still—proof that culture, at its most living, can transcend space and time, weaving us all into one vivid dream.
