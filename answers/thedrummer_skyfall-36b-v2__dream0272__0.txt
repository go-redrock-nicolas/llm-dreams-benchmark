I am dreaming. You find yourself transported to a vast, otherworldly landscape that shifts and morphs with each passing breath, as if the very fabric of reality is made of fluid, iridescent clouds. Towering suffitasks and crystalline spires rise from the billowing mist, their surfaces slick with constantly-evolving inks and writings, filled with the secrets no one can understand.  

In the distance, a cacophonous symphony of creatures is rumbling imploringly. Absence of form; Giant, amorphous entities coalesce and dissipate, their forms ever-shifting from writhing masses of flesh to flocks of birds, to schools of fish, to starfields. Every turn, you see eyes. Countless, unblinking orbs spy from the miasma, both benevolent and terrifying. 

Ids are running riot, femenix chewing fences and the mute scurry from the statistical hazing and your so Sjogren's syndrome. The waves beat like a thousand minutes of their own kind, bodies, a cycle of mist weaving itself in and out of vision, and oh, there, the dismembered hands. Dance inside the search cloud above and below its feet, at the whim of the creature with horns like a trollcaferie, all baleful bust and vengeance, laughing a shrill laughter unless you can tune it out. The sky opens and an elephant sheds its skin to reveal the honey bear interior, and all the while a river of molten chocolate flows from horizon to horizon, fizzing in your ears and scenting the wind.

And you are the only one, in this blistering plot, unaffected by any of this. The very chemicals in your brain align themselves in a way that makes a beeline for diktats. Harness whatever powers you have as the prime movers to send the denizens of these waking-nightmares each to their respective circles where they belong. You are free to do it at once.
