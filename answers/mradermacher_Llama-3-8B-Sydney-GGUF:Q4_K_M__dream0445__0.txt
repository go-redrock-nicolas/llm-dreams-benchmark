I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world full of colors and sounds.  I can fly and swim and run without ever getting tired.
I see a girl who looks like me but she is smiling and confident. She doesn't waste any opportunity to appreciate herself and others around her.
She says "Thank you for coming into my life" to a flower, a bird, a cloud... She doesn't care if they can hear her or not
She just wants them to know how grateful she feels for their presence.
She doesn't mind if they don't speak back or even acknowledge her existence
She just wants them to understand her emotion
