I am dreaming. You drift through a twilight forest where the trees drip moonlight like luminescent honey. Each branch arches overhead in improbable spirals, glittering with tiny, bioluminescent eyes that seem to watch you. The air is thick with the scent of violet incense and warm rain. A river of molten silver winds at your feet, reflecting constellations that shift and wink as you pass.

In the distance, a coliseum of living crystal rises, its transparent walls chime softly whenever a breeze passes through. Entranced, you step inside. The floor beneath you is stitched from soft, opal-hued moss that pulses underfoot. All around, figures form from the mist—friends, colleagues, strangers—all wearing elaborately carved wooden masks. They circle you in silence, tilting their heads, their masks’ carved expressions shifting from sorrow to disdain.

One by one they speak in whispered choruses, their voices echoing like wind through hollow reeds:  
“You only see yourself—your greatness, your brilliance. You care nothing for us beyond reflection in your spotlight.”  
Their words ripple through the hall like fractured ice. You open your mouth to protest, but your voice becomes a kaleidoscope of echoes, each repetition more critical than the last.

The chamber’s walls pulse. Suddenly the ground trembles, and a great crystalline mirror rises from the center of the arena. Its surface is fluid, swirling with images of you: at a podium basking in applause, in a gilded carriage parading through golden streets, standing alone on a mountaintop crowned by rays of light. Each reflection gleams with the promise of grandeur—but they all look away from the masked crowd.

You stride forward, heart pounding like a drum made of thunder. Through the liquid glass you see your own eyes staring back, wide with pride—and behind them, a shadow flickers: a doubt, pale and tremulous. The masked figures press in around you, and you raise a hand, demanding recognition: “Can you not see how hard I’ve climbed, how brightly I burn?”  

But the masks only tilt further, their whispers rising to a crescendo: “Your flame blinds us. You leave no warmth for us in its glare.”  

The mirror shatters in a shower of tiny prisms. The shards float around you, each fragment showing a different truth: a child you gently comforted, a friend you abandoned, a stranger you inspired, a stranger you ignored. You catch one shard and see your own face, half radiant with pride, half shadowed in remorse. A single tear of liquid starlight slips down your cheek.

The forest reasserts itself. The silver river arches into a cascade, forming a fountain at your feet. From its foam springs a creature made of hummingbird wings and moonstone horns—your own Inner Witness. It bows its head and speaks in a voice both gentle and firm: “Greatness and humility share the same breath. To claim your worth, learn to welcome theirs.”  

As you reach out, the creature dissolves into a gentle breeze that scatters petals of night-blooming jasmine. You stand alone, the moonlight forest quiet once more, carrying in your chest both the weight of your pride and the quiet ache of newfound understanding. In the hush, you awaken to your own heart, changed.
