I am dreaming. You awaken in a world where the very fabric of reality is a living, breathing enigma. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, swirling in slow motion, reflecting and warping the landscape below. The ground beneath you is not a fixed entity but a mosaic of floating islands, each a fragment of a different ecosystem: a patch of desert sand here, a slab of crystalline ice there, a mossy hillock that hums when you step on it. Gravity is capricious—one moment it tugs you downward, the next it releases you into a slow-motion drift toward the sky, as if the air itself is made of honey. You learn to navigate by instinct, exhaling sharply to anchor yourself to a nearby rock that hasn’t decided yet whether it’s solid or smoke.  

Time here is a river with no current. You watch a flower bloom in reverse, its petals retracting into a bud that sinks into the soil, leaving behind a faint glow. A tree nearby is both ancient and newborn: its roots are fossilized stone, its branches sprout leaves that flicker between green and ash. You blink, and a moment stretches into an hour; blink again, and the horizon collapses like a telescope, bringing the distant mountains to your doorstep. Causality is a game of whispers. You throw a stone into a pool, and the ripples precede the splash. A shadow passes over you—a creature with wings made of stained glass—and you feel the wind of its flight before you see it, then after, then never.  

Survival demands a new kind of logic. Hunger is not sated by food but by memories: you bite into a fruit that tastes like your childhood dog’s fur, and for a moment, you’re eight years old again, chasing fireflies. Thirst is quenched by swallowing light—plucking a glowing orb from a tree and letting it dissolve on your tongue, sweet and electric. But the world resists permanence. The fruit rots into a seed mid-bite; the light orb explodes into a flock of paper birds that scatter into the wind. You learn to improvise. You catch a falling star in your hands—a tiny, sputtering sun—and cradle it until it cools into a compass that points not north, but *forward*, toward the next iteration of the path.  

The inhabitants of this realm are riddles given form. A woman with a face of shifting constellations offers you a key made of water, warning that it unlocks only what you’re willing to lose. A river speaks in palindromes, its current flowing uphill as it recounts stories of travelers who became mountains, their bones now quarries of singing stone. You barter with a moth the size of a horse, trading your voice for a map inked in its own bioluminescent dust. The map glows faintly, but its lines rearrange themselves when you’re not looking, leading you toward a city built inside a gargantuan seashell, its spires spiraling into the shell’s iridescent whorls.  

Yet danger is the price of wonder. A patch of fog erases whatever it touches—step into it, and you forget your own name, your body dissolving into a flock of moths. You evade a creature that is all teeth and backwards joints by hiding inside a moment that loops endlessly: a single second where a raindrop hovers mid-fall, and the air smells of ozone and forgotten birthdays. You realize the only constant is change itself, and to survive, you must surrender to the chaos—to breathe in the illogic, let it reshape your bones, and trust that the world will stitch itself into meaning when it’s ready.  

When you finally wake, your hands tremble with the memory of a place where nothing made sense, and everything was true.
