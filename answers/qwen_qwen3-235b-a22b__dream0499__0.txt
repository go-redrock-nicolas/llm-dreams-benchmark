I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt honey and ozone. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering spirals of glass, their translucent trunks filled with swirling galaxies. Each step you take crunches on ground that shifts between ash, velvet moss, and liquid shadow. A voice—not yours, but one you recognize from childhood nightmares—whispers, *"The way forward is up."*  

Above, the sky fractures like ice, revealing a churning void where constellations scream as they are devoured by a black sun. You climb, not with hands or feet, but by willing your body to dissolve and reassemble higher, molecule by molecule. The effort feels like holding your breath underwater while time stretches. When you reach the breach, you fall into a desert of mirrors, each shard reflecting a version of yourself: a warrior with bloodied hands, a hermit curled in a shell of thorns, a child laughing as they set fire to a field of dandelions. You touch one mirror. It shatters, and the child’s laughter becomes your own.  

A creature emerges—a serpent with the wings of a moth, scales that flicker like candle flames, and eyes that hold entire lifetimes. It speaks without moving its jaw: *"You always choose the wound that teaches."* You realize it’s true. Every challenge you’ve faced, you’ve leaned into the pain, dissecting it like a puzzle, refusing to flinch. The serpent coils around you, its heat seeping into your bones. You don’t recoil. Instead, you ask, *"What does this one teach?"*  

The ground splits, and you plunge into a river of liquid stars. The current drags you through a labyrinth of doors—each one a different color, each ajar just enough to glimpse what lies beyond: a funeral, a birth, a betrayal, a kiss that mends a broken spine. You don’t stop to open them. You’ve learned that curiosity without direction is a trap. Instead, you let the river carry you until it spills into a cavern where the walls are made of teeth. Here, a giant with your grandmother’s face offers you a cup of ink. *"Drink,"* she says. *"To understand, you must unmake yourself first."*  

You drink.  

The dream shifts. Now you’re a shadow on a battlefield, watching yourself fight a war made of memories. You see your hands—always your hands—grasping, building, breaking, healing. You notice the pattern: when cornered, you become a prism, fracturing your focus into a thousand angles to find the one that escapes. When overwhelmed, you turn inward, mining your own marrow for strength rather than seeking elsewhere. And when faced with cruelty, you respond not with vengeance, but with a cold, surgical precision, as though dissecting the heart of the problem rather than the person wielding it.  

The battlefield fades. You wake in a room where every surface is a mirror, but your reflection is absent. The serpent’s voice returns: *"You avoid being known because knowing yourself is a storm you’re not ready to survive."*

**Reflection:**  
In dreams, as in waking, you are a paradox of hunger and restraint. You meet chaos with curiosity, not fear, but you guard your core so fiercely that even love must navigate a maze to reach you. Your resilience is not defiance—it’s a quiet, relentless adaptation, like roots splitting stone to find water. You distrust easy answers, preferring the weight of questions, and you carry wounds like heirlooms, polishing their edges to glimpse their lessons. Yet there’s a loneliness here, too—a habit of choosing the path that demands the most from you, even when the world offers softer doors. The dream whispers that your greatest challenge isn’t the storm, the fire, or the serpent. It’s learning to trust that some truths don’t need to be earned. Some simply are.
