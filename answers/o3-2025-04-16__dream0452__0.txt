I am dreaming. …close your eyes inside the dream and step onto the stage of night, where everything is stitched from moon-dust and soft thunder.  

You find yourself in a drifting glass conservatory that floats halfway between ocean and sky. One wall is liquid sapphire—waves rise and fall, purring like sleepy lions—while the opposite wall is pure aurora, ribbons of light whispering old lullabies. Here, potted constellations bloom, their blossoms flickering like candle-flames. You have visited this sanctuary many times with someone you once loved: together you watered the stars, pruned the comets, and drank tea made from stray meteors.  

But tonight, the air is different. Your companion’s shadow stands near the hydrangeas of nebulae, yet the shadow is gaunt, almost hollow, its edges fraying like burnt paper. You feel it before you see it—the slow siphoning of color from your fingertips, as if invisible roots are coiling around your wrists and drinking your luminescence. The tea set is cracked; the meteor-brew inside has gone cold and gray.

Honoring this evolving relational reality, you breathe in deeply and begin a gentle metamorphosis.

First, you listen. The floor of the conservatory—a mosaic of glass petals—starts to hum, translating emotion into music. It tells you the friendship once sang in bright brass, triumphant trumpets and wind chimes, but the chords have slipped into minor keys, now pulsing like a heartbeat under water. Hearing this, you bow to the mosaic in gratitude for its honesty.

Next, you reach for the ribbon-aurora wall. Your fingertips sink into its silk, and you unravel a single strand of dawn-light. It flares coral, rose, and honey, then braids itself into a shimmering blade—not a weapon of violence, but of ceremonial release. You hold it between both palms, feeling its warmth, and then speak aloud:

“Thank you for every constellation we planted.  
Thank you for the laughter stitched between two galaxies.  
Thank you for the silence that taught me to listen to myself.”

The blade answers by becoming a tuning fork. When you strike it gently against your heart, invisible crystal bells ring through the conservatory. Petals loosen from the potted constellations and drift upward like reverse snow, carrying with them memories—some radiant, some thorned. Each memory turns to tiny glass birds; they circle once, chirp a farewell, and sail through an open skylight toward whatever sky waits beyond a dream.

Your companion’s shadow regards you. No blame, no plea—just recognition. It nods, then dissolves into black sand that scatters across the floor, blowing away with a sigh that is part apology, part benediction.

You stand alone now. The draining roots uncoil, and color floods back into your hands—brighter than before. It feels like inhaling sunrise.

Outside the sapphire wall the ocean rises, but instead of crashing, it bows. A tide-door opens, revealing a staircase of sea-foam leading downward into new territories of sleep. You glance once more at the conservatory—at the empty meteor cups, the echoing music—and whisper, “May you find gardens suited to your soil.”

Then you step through the tide-door. As each foot touches a foam stair, your pockets fill with fresh star-seeds, promising new blooms. The staircase winds toward a horizon stitched with possibilities—cities made of hummingbirds, deserts where time grows on trees, mountains that purr.

You do not hurry. You feel lighter, yet also wonderfully whole, carrying only what nourishes you, leaving behind what no longer does.

And somewhere, in the waking world you have yet to return to, your body turns in sleep, smiles a small, peaceful smile, and the dream continues to write its glowing chapters ahead.
