I am dreaming. You are floating in a cavern of midnight blue mist, the air humming with distant, half-remembered lullabies. Beneath your feet, the floor is made of polished obsidian that reflects molten ribbons of gold. Every step sends gentle ripples through that liquid light, and with each ripple you hear a single whispered syllable—like a name you cannot quite place.

Ahead, a grand mirror stands on a dais of bone-white marble. Its frame is carved with twisting vines of silver, each leaf alive with tiny pulsing lights. You approach, heart pounding, and when you peer in, you see yourself—but not just yourself. Beside your reflection stands someone dear to you, bathed in a soft, amber glow of innocence. They smile as if nothing in the world could ever break them.

And then the surface of the glass cracks. A jagged fissure races across the mirror, and through it you glimpse another scene: the person you love, tears sliding down their cheeks, their world crumbling around them as they discover a secret so dark it would shatter them. You’re rooted to the spot, stomach coiled in lead. You feel the secret burrow under your skin, a restless creature that whispers its poison into your ear.

Suddenly the cavern shifts. You’re no longer on marble but on a narrow rope bridge strung over a black void. On one end stands your friend, oblivious, laughing as they chase fireflies that glow like tiny suns. On the other end lies the mirror again, its crack widening until shards rain down through the void. You know that mirror hides the truth—if you touch it, the secret will spill out in a storm of broken glass and irreversible words.

Beneath you the bridge sways, each creak a reminder that keeping this knowledge is a tightrope walk. Your heart pounds so loud it drowns out the giggles drifting from your friend’s side. You raise your hand to warn them—but as you reach out, the rope snaps, and you plunge. For a moment you fall through cold air so thick it tastes like regret. Just before you hit bottom, you catch a glimpse of your own eyes in the mirror’s reflection: terrified, desperate.

Then everything shifts again. You’re standing in a cottage warmed by firelight. Your friend sits at a wooden table, tracing the grain with their fingertips, humming a tune you’ve always loved. You hover in the doorway, clutching a folded piece of parchment—the embodiment of that terrible secret—its edges already dripping shadows. Their innocent hum wraps around your chest like a velvet noose, and you realize there is no safe place to hide this burden.

As they unknowingly continue their life while you hold this burden, you press your palm to your chest, feeling the secret pulse there like an extra heartbeat. The room’s warmth warps. The walls lean in, eager to press you into confession. Your friend looks up, and in that moment your gaze locks—eyes searching for reassurance, for the laughter you used to share. But all you feel is the weight of silence.

The dream fractures once more—visions of future heartbreak flicker on the walls, silhouettes of you and your friend drifting apart like ships in fog. You wake before you make a choice: will you carry this secret in silence, or will you shatter the mirror forever and risk everything? The question hangs in the dim light of your half-awake mind, echoing long after the dream has dissolved.
