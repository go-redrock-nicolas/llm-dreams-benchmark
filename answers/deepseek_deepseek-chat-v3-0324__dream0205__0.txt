I am dreaming. I stand in an ancient, candlelit chamber with walls covered in cryptic symbols that seem to shift when observed from different angles. My hands grip a ceremonial dagger made of black obsidian, its edge gleaming unnaturally in the flickering light. Around me, hooded figures chant in a language that resonates deep in my bones, their voices harmonizing with distant thunder. 

A realization crashes over me; they’ve chosen me as their new High Seer, their whispered prophecies declaring me "the Unbroken Mirror." But my stomach churns as the dagger’s purpose becomes clear—tonight’s ritual requires the sacrifice of a willing participant, someone who believes their soul will ascend through the blade. 

The candidate steps forward, eyes alight with fervor. They murmur, "The shadows hunger for my truth," before baring their chest. My fingers tremble against the dagger’s hilt. I despise this, yet the society’s intricate web of obligations tightens around me. Their customs demand I take a life to "balance the unseen scales," but everything in me screams to shatter tradition. 

The chanting crescendos, the candle flames turning an eerie blue. I must decide: plunge the dagger into flesh and bind myself to their ways forever, or risk the wrath of forces lurking in the corners of the chamber—forces that breathe in syncopation with the very stones around us.
