I am dreaming. The ground beneath me feels soft, like walking on clouds.  The sky is a swirling tapestry of colors I can't nameâ€”maybe hues that don't exist in the waking world.  I glance down and see my hands glowing faintly, as if lit from within by a thousand tiny fireflies.  A voice, both familiar and alien, whispers, "What would you like to discover today?"  I realize I can shape my thoughts into physical forms just by imagining them.
