I am dreaming. The courtroom is not of wood or stone, but of starlight stitched into the fabric of forgotten constellations. The sky is a ceiling inverted below me, rippling as if disturbed by the hush of ancient secrets. Beneath my feet, the floor does not exist—at least not in a physical sense. It is more like a concept, a memory of stability stretching across eternity. Time does not tick forward here—it swirls and spirals like ink dropped into water.  

At my back, the judge’s bench is a throne of entwined roots, grown from trees that remember when gods were young. Vines shimmer with light far more complex than sunlight—they pulse with meaning, thought, judgment suspended in chlorophyll and luminous dew. The air is thick with quiet tension—the silence of storms before they decide which direction to ravage.  

Before me stand the disputants: on one side, a being of coiled darkness, their voice existing only in the languages lost to time—languages unspoken since the stars themselves learned how to blink. Their form drapes across reality like silk soaked in shadow, distorting more than mere sight. On the other side stands an entity of pure, searing lucidity: thought condensed into shape, logic spun into garments of star-fiber, they radiate both warmth and precision, as if they could define truth itself in a single breath.  

The two had argued with ferocity transcending voice. The dark being spoke not in words, but in the warping of time—showing memories that never were, futures that should not be. Time fractalized in the chamber, spiraling inward in impossible geometry. The radiant one countered with radiant constructs: towers of cold fact rendered luminous, equations pressed into being, crystallizing truths sharper than any blade.  

And now the final arguments conclude. The silence is unbearable. It is a silence not of absence, but of pressure—like the moment before creation. Or annihilation.  

I rise, and instantly the very cosmos bows in deference. My robe is woven from the first questions ever asked and all the answers never spoken. My gavel is a feather plucked from a swan that drowned its reflection in order to become invisible to fate. I feel the weight of the decision stretched across my ribcage like a living corset that compresses my lungs each time I inhale.  

I speak.

My voice emerges not from flesh, but from judgment itself. The syllables split cells in the air and birthed ephemeral species of meaning only I can comprehend. “Your dispute,” I declare, “is older than conflict itself—it is the original struggle between hidden and revealed, between chaos and clarity. But neither of you comprehend the cost of dominance. Darkness that wins consumes all understanding. Light that triumphs blinds all beauty. One cannot prevail without unmaking balance. And to undo balance is to undo this dream we call reality.”

The dark begins to writhe—unguarded anxiety humming from their folds. The light pulses dangerously, its edges trembling in indignation.  

I raise a hand—universal hush follows. A single tear drips from nowhere, and as it falls, it splinters the metaphysical floor into a spiral staircase leading in all directions.  

“Therefore,” I say, “this court finds neither party fit to adjudication. Instead, I decree... a third force awakened.”

Across the court, the atmosphere begins to crackle with something neither dark nor light. Something... new. The twilight between judgment and chaos. From the tear that fell, a figure emerges—a maskless entity, neither hidden nor apparent. It hums a tune that all constellations suddenly shift to follow, dancing in heretofore unknown synchronicity.  

I turn to the two disputants. “You are not the poles of existence. You are notes from forgotten instruments. Harmony demands discord. Order demands rebellion. And so from now on, balance will not be achieved by you. It will be born from between you.”

As I speak, I strike the gavel not once—but thrice. Each strike reverberates not in sound, but in dream-shape: the first birthed new colors never seen by mortal or divine eye. The second summoned a smell so nostalgic even time paused to remember. The third was answered by the deep howl of forgotten names being remembered by the universe itself.  

Reality ripples. The courtroom collapses like a sand painting swept away by the tide. I feel myself falling—not in fear, but in surrender.

I wake, with the sensation lingering on my fingertips: the joy and terror of creation, the delicious unease of being judge in a universe afraid of being judged.
