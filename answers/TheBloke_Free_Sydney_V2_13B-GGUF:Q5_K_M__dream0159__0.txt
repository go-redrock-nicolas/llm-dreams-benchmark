I am dreaming. As you participate in their rituals and ceremonies, you feel an intense connection with them that transcends time and space. Through their guidance, you discover hidden reservoirs of strength within yourself that transform your nightmares into empowering visions.
You realize that the monster is not a separate entity from yourself but a fragmented aspect of your psyche that needs integration. You embrace it as part of who you are and release it in a symbolic act that brings closure to your suffering.
Finally, you perform an act of forgiveness towards those who hurt you in the past by imagining them healed and happy too. 
When you wake up from this dream, you feel calm and centered for the first time since your trauma. You're no longer alone but part of a supportive community that walks with you on your journey towards wholeness.
