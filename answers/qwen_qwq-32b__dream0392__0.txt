I am dreaming. The air here smells like rain on hot pavement, that sharp, almost electrical tang that prickles the back of my throat.  Colors bleed into one another—sunsets stretch thick as spilled paint across a chalkboard sky.  I walk on a path made of starlight, each step causing it to ripple like liquid metal.  Ahead, a forest of glass trees towers above me, their leaves chiming like crystal wind chimes when they brush against each other.  Their stems are translucent, revealing bioluminescent insects crawling inside, glowing neon blue and violet.  A river of liquid mercury flows through the valley below, reflecting not my face but fragments of memories—Mom’s laugh, the first time I held a newborn puppy, the moment I realized I was alone.  A figure emerges from the mercury, its form shifting between humanoid and something with too many eyes and legs.  It speaks without moving its lips:  “You keep running from the truth, but the labyrinth only repeats itself until you face it.”  The ground shifts, and I’m falling into a room with walls made of flickering screens, each showing different versions of my life—paths not taken, loves lost, alternate realities where I made different choices.  The screens melt into a clock whose hands spin backward, and I wake up clutching the remnants of a song I heard in the glass forest.
