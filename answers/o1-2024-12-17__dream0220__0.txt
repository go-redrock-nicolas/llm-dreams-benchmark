I am dreaming. You find yourself floating in a flowing silk gown of shimmering twilight hues, drifting across an endless expanse of luminous sand. The air sparkles with motes of bright indigo, each one buzzing with hushed reverb, as if the atmosphere itself is humming an otherworldly lullaby. The sky is a patchwork of obsidian and metallic gold, torn apart by faint streaks of rose that bend and twist like living brushstrokes. You sense it is night, yet strangely enough, everything is illuminated as if it’s midday.

A distant spire calls to you, towering in the hazy horizon, its structure twisted in loops and spirals, like a ribbon of obsidian shot through with glints of starlight. Voices—no, more like echoes—drift all around, and as you step into the spire’s grand hall, you notice something unique: the people you see are solemn, brows furrowed, intently examining one another. The moment you make eye contact, they bare their teeth in a snarl…and suddenly you realize they’re smiling in this reversed realm. In fact, all forms of courtesy seem turned upside down. A sneer, loud scoffs, even eye-rolling—these are greeted with admiration and respect. Meanwhile, gentle banter, friendly handshakes, or polite nods are considered insolent or even disrespectful.

A swirl of shimmering cloth passes by, and a figure with hollow, graceful features approaches. They scowl at you with such ferocity that your spine prickles, but you must remember: to them, it’s the warmest welcome. Fighting the urge to grin back, you try to school your features into a scowl, hoping to display the correct greeting. Your lips contort into an awkward twist, and not one, but three onlookers clap delightedly at your “display of sincerity.” It still rattles your bones; you can’t quite accept that your “glaring” has now become the polite standard.

Navigating this strange society is like learning the slow steps of an unearthly dance. One moment, you catch yourself about to offer polite words before you remember it’s better to grunt “Hmph!” with a dismissive flick of your hand. Another time, you instinctively hold a door open for someone—only to realize, too late, you should have let it slam shut in their face as a gracious gesture. Yet you sense, deep down, these people are brimming with compassion. They, too, are simply demonstrating affection in their own convoluted, wondrous ways.

And through this twilight dreamscape, as you adapt, you feel a peculiar freedom. Their mores and habits may be strangely inverted, but a part of you thrills at the fresh perspective. For once, you can howl your welcomes, growl your friendships, and stomp your appreciation, unbound by the polite constraints you’ve always known. Each new revelation guides your transformation, until you stand on the throbbing, luminous sands again, no longer feeling like an outsider among reversed protocols. Instead, your heart is open, dancing in harmony with every befuddling nuance, aflame with the thrill of new understanding. And even as you stir awake, the echoes of that spire’s hush linger in your mind, reminding you that sometimes, the distance between a sneer and a grin is not so wide after all.
