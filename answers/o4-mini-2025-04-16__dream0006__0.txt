I am dreaming. You inhale the heady perfume of night-blooming flowers drifting in from unseen gardens, and you begin to speak. Your voice, at first soft and quivering, grows in resonance until it ripples through the auditorium like golden silk sliding over polished marble. Each word you utter fans into life tiny motes of light that dance above the audience’s heads, weaving lace-like patterns in the humid air. You speak of forgotten dreams, of emerald cities beneath glass oceans, and the crowd leans forward as if they can taste your visions.

With every sentence, the stage beneath your feet transforms: oak planks dissolve into gleaming white petals, and you’re floating just above them, barefoot and weightless. As you continue, an unseen orchestra swells behind you—strings that sigh, horns that bloom like trumpets of sunlight—underscoring your every phrase. The people before you grow transparent, their outlines shimmering; you glimpse constellations of hope and longing mapped across their pale skin.

Suddenly, the words you speak begin to take physical form. “Courage,” you declare, and a translucent bird the size of a swan emerges from your mouth, its wings beating slow arcs of pale fire. It circles the hall, dropping feathers of purest silver that dissolve into sparks when they touch the floor. “Compassion,” you whisper next, and the walls themselves blossom with vines of glowing blue-green leaves, curling toward the ceiling as if to hear more.

As you approach your speech’s crescendo, the air hums with an expectant energy. The entire audience becomes one living tapestry—heartbeats synchronized, breaths aligned—waiting on the final word that will send them all soaring back into their own secret dreams. And just before you speak it, time pauses: a single droplet of perfumed water hangs in midair, reflecting the infinite possibilities that lie beyond waking.
