I am dreaming. You step forward, heart thrumming like a hummingbird’s wingbeat, and the ground beneath your feet dissolves into a living mosaic of molten glass and drifting stardust. Every breath tastes of moonlight and near-forgotten memories, as if you’re inhaling the echo of a thousand sunsets. Overhead, swirling ribbons of color—emerald, violet, molten gold—twist and dance, painting silent symphonies across a sky that ripples like liquid silk. Each step sends ripples through the iridescent floor, sending tiny sparks of light shooting out in all directions, like fireflies startled into flight.

A gentle voice, neither wholly male nor female, brushes past your ear in a language you almost understand. Drawn toward it, you follow a path of floating lanterns—each lamp a tiny galaxy suspended on gossamer threads. As you pass, you glimpse fleeting visions in their glass walls: a child’s laughter echoing in an ancient forest, a phoenix bursting flame and ash, a vast library carved from living crystal. You realize these are fragments of possible lives, waiting for you to choose one and step inside.

Ahead of you, a grand archway formed of twisting vines enwreathed with opalescent blossoms pulses with curious warmth. Beyond it lies a chamber where gravity ceases to exist: you drift, spinning gently, as soft chimes ring in consonance with your own heartbeat. In the very center hovers a translucent orb, glowing with all the colors you’ve just witnessed. The orb seems to pulse in rhythm with your breath. You reach out a hand, fingertips trembling with anticipation… and as your skin meets its surface, you feel a surge of boundless wonder, as though the entire universe has opened its secret heart to you.
