I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  
You sit cross-legged on a platform of living moonstone that pulses with pale blue light. All around, two armies face you: one garbed in shifting silks of sunset orange, the other in armor wrought from midnight-black onyx. Between them is a vast chasm of fractured glass, each shard reflecting a single angry memory from their centuries of war.  

When both sides present irreconcilable demands—one insists on reclaiming ancient deserts, the other on dissolving all borders—you pause. The glow of the moonstone intensifies, and suddenly you feel its heartbeat in your own chest. You rise, arms outstretched, and draw a single silver thread of light from the rim of the chasm. The thread weaves itself into a slender bridge, arching over the broken glass, shimmering with every color that ever dawned or died.  

The orange-silked envoy steps forward, wary. The onyx-armored champion advances too, fists clenched. But as they cross that fragile bridge, something miraculous happens. The thread of light splits into two gossamer ribbons, wrapping each envoy’s wrist. They look at their own hands—at each other—and feel the pulse of the moonstone’s peace beating through their veins. Their eyes meet, and for the first time in centuries, they hesitate.  

You speak in a voice that sounds both thunderous and whispering: “Trade your sorrow for mine. Let me hold the weight of your grudges so that you may see beyond them.” Slowly, you inhale their grief, drawing it into your chest, where it dissolves into prismatic motes of hope. The shards in the chasm below glow and mend themselves, reforming into a seamless mirror that reflects not war, but the possibility of harmony.  

As the two envoys lower their weapons, petals of light drift down from the heavens, carpeting the living moonstone in a soft, forgiving glow. You feel your own heart lighten; the centuries-old hatred has been unspooled, strand by strand, until only potential remains. The platform tilts, and the three of you float upward into a sky made of liquid amethyst. There, you exchange not demands, but dreams—dreams of olive groves and dancing flames, of libraries that hold every story ever told, of children laughing in every tongue.  

You wake with the taste of moonlight on your lips, the echo of those shared dreams still ringing in your mind. The war has ended, at least within you, and a single silver thread remains curled in your palm—proof that even the deepest divides can be bridged by a dream.
