I am dreaming. You find yourself floating inside a vast, candle-lit cathedral made of clouds. The pillars are columns of mist, translucent and moon-silver, rising higher than any sky you have ever seen. Organs fashioned from thunderheads boom a quiet, low chord—like a heartbeat approaching on distant wings.  

In your hands you cradle a tiny glass bird. Its hollow body glows with the soft ember-colored light of someone you love—someone who, in waking life, is suddenly, painfully gone. The bird is warm, pulsing gently against your palms, alive with miniature constellations that mirror every shared memory, every laugh that once stitched the two of you together.  

A gust of wind—sharp and ice-clean—slips through the cathedral. Your grip falters. The glass bird tumbles. You snatch, miss, snatch again, but your fingertips graze only migrating wisps of vapor. The bird strikes the marble-cloud floor and explodes into a rain of glittering shards that fall, fall, fall into darkness. The booming chord stops. Silence rushes in, vast enough to make you dizzy.

The floor collapses underfoot. You plummet through layers of dreamscape like pages being torn from a book. Each layer is a memory:

• A beach at dusk where the two of you traced shapes in seashells and pretended the tide would never come.  
• A kitchen filled with the smell of cinnamon buns and the soft static of an ancient radio.  
• A bus window shimmering with city lights where you first realized you might be brave together.  

They pass in an instant—flashes of color whipping by like postcards on fire—until you land with a soft hush on a desert made of ashes. The horizon flickers. Stars hang low, almost within reach, cracked like fractured mirrors. And there, half-buried in the dune, lies one intact shard of the glass bird. It pulses weakly, the color of sunset after a storm. You reach for it, but every step forward erases your footprints behind you, as though the world refuses to remember you existed.

Grief becomes weather. Ash spirals into miniature tornados that whisper, “It’s over, it’s over, it’s over,” around your ankles. A storm front blots out the stars, and lightning scrawls your regrets in crooked handwriting across the sky. You sink to your knees—heavy, heavier, as if the planet itself were tethered to your ribs—and for a moment it seems easier to stay there forever, held down by invisible ballast.

A sound interrupts: drip… drip… drip. Through the storm’s roar you realize rain is falling—liquid silver that collects in small craters around you. Each droplet projects a shared memory like a tiny projector bulb. Your lost loved one is laughing in every puddle, alive in refracted fragments. The world is giving you back what you thought had shattered beyond repair.

You cup a handful of this silver water. It shines brighter than the shard itself, as though the dream is telling you: “Look, everything you loved still exists somewhere—transformed, but not destroyed.” You press the water to your chest, and it sinks into you, kindle-warm. The heaviness loosens; the ash desert melts into fertile, black soil. The shard rises, floats, and plants itself in the earth like a seed.

From that seed sprouts a sapling carved from living light, branches etched in glowing runes. Leaves unfurl as crystalline feathers—echoes of the bird—each one bearing a memory you feared was lost. Some leaves hum lullabies; others release soft echoes of conversations that used to fill midnight kitchens. You realize this is a tree of remembrance. Even in dreamtime it tells the truth: grief does not erase, it transfigures.

The storm breaks. Dawn—rose-gold, startlingly vivid—sweeps across the sky. Light flows through the translucent cathedral-pillars that now grow like trees among rolling meadows you hadn’t noticed before. Every blade of grass rings like a tiny bell when brushed by the breeze, and the air smells of rain after a long drought. You stand, lighter, breathing deeply. The tree’s highest branch bows toward you, offering a single luminescent feather. You take it. It turns into a quill.

Instinctively you draw a doorway in the air. The quill’s tip spills bright ink that becomes a threshold of shimmering color. On the other side glimmers not “back then,” nor “what once was,” but “what could be.” You feel a thrum of possibility rather than an echo of endings.

You step through.  

You awaken.

Somewhere, beneath the morning’s pale light, you still carry that feather—now invisible but felt—inside your chest: a reminder that love can fracture, yes, but even broken glass can be melted and reshaped into something that holds light again.
