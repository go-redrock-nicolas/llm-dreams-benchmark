I am dreaming. find myself standing alone in a vast, dimly lit ballroom, its walls adorned with intricate, gilded patterns that seem to twist and shimmer as if alive. The air is thick with a faint, floral scent, like wilting roses, and a low hum of distant chatter vibrates through the space, though I see no one around me. My heart races, each beat echoing in my chest like a drum, as I realize I’m dressed in an unfamiliar, ornate outfit—a deep crimson gown or suit, heavy with velvet and lace, that feels both suffocating and foreign on my skin. I glance down at my hands, trembling slightly, and notice they’re clutching an invitation, its edges frayed and ink smudged, though I can’t make out the words.

The anxiety gnaws at me, a relentless tide rising in my chest, as I think about the upcoming social gathering. These people—strangers with sharp, judging eyes—are waiting for me somewhere beyond this endless room. I don’t know them, yet their opinions already weigh heavier than the fabric draped over me. My mind spirals with questions: Will I say the wrong thing? Will they see through my carefully constructed facade? My stomach churns, and I take a hesitant step forward, my shoes clicking unnaturally loud against the polished marble floor, each sound reverberating like a thunderclap.

Suddenly, the ballroom shifts. The walls ripple like water, and the floor beneath me tilts, forcing me to stumble toward a towering set of double doors at the far end. They loom impossibly tall, carved with grotesque, leering faces that seem to watch my every move. As I draw closer, the hum of voices grows louder, more distinct—a cacophony of laughter, whispers, and incomprehensible murmurs that seem to mock my every insecurity. My hand hovers over the ornate handle, cold as ice beneath my fingertips, and I hesitate. Beyond this door lies the gathering, and with it, the inescapable judgment I dread.

But before I can decide whether to push through or flee, the doors creak open on their own, revealing not a crowded room of strangers, but a surreal, otherworldly garden bathed in an eerie, twilight glow. Twisted, bioluminescent trees with glowing violet leaves spiral upward, their branches reaching out like skeletal hands. A path of shimmering, glass-like stones winds through the garden, and floating orbs of light drift lazily in the air, casting strange shadows that dance across the ground. The voices are still there, but now they seem to emanate from the very flora around me, whispering my name in tones that range from curious to accusatory.

I step into the garden, my anxiety morphing into a curious dread. The air is cooler here, but it prickles my skin with an electric charge. As I follow the path, I notice figures emerging from the shadows—silhouettes of people I don’t recognize, yet feel I *should*. Their faces are obscured, blurred as if smudged by an artist’s careless hand, but their presence is heavy, suffocating. They don’t approach, but their unseen eyes bore into me, and I can feel their silent questions piling up: *Who are you? Why are you here? Are you enough?*

I quicken my pace, desperate to escape their gaze, but the path loops endlessly, circling back on itself. My breath hitches as I realize there’s no way out. The glowing orbs begin to dim, one by one, and the whispers grow louder, more insistent, weaving into a chant I can’t quite decipher. My heart pounds so fiercely I fear it might burst, and I drop to my knees on the cold, glassy path, clutching my head as the weight of their judgment threatens to crush me.

Just as the darkness seems ready to swallow me whole, a single orb of light flares brighter, hovering just above my head. It pulses gently, emitting a soft, melodic hum that drowns out the whispers. I look up, mesmerized by its warmth, and feel a strange calm wash over me. The figures in the shadows begin to fade, their presence less oppressive, and I realize that the anxiety—the fear of not fitting in, of being seen as lesser—starts to loosen its grip. I stand, shaky but determined, and as I do, the garden transforms once more. The trees straighten, their glow softening to a comforting amber, and the path ahead unfurls into a clear, open meadow under a starry sky.

I take a deep breath, the floral scent now fresh and invigorating, and step forward. The gathering may still await me, those unknown faces and their unspoken critiques, but in this moment, I feel a flicker of courage. Maybe I don’t need to be perfect for them. Maybe showing up, as I am, is enough. The dream lingers on the edge of waking, the meadow stretching endlessly before me, and for the first time, I feel ready to face whatever lies ahead.
