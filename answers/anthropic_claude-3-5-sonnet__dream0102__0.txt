I am dreaming. ....

I find myself in a sunlit office where the walls seem to pulse gently with a warm, honeyed glow. The leather armchair beneath me feels both firm and yielding, like a living thing responding to my presence. Across from me sits my patient - their face keeps subtly shifting, as faces do in dreams, sometimes clear and other times rippling like a reflection in disturbed water.

They're weeping, but their tears float upward instead of falling down, creating tiny crystalline spheres that hover in the air between us. With each sob, the room seems to contract and expand, breathing in sync with their emotional state. The potted plants in the corners have begun to grow and twist in real-time, their leaves unfurling and reaching toward my distressed patient like comforting hands.

I open my mouth to speak, and find my words materializing as ribbons of colored light - soft blues and healing greens that weave through the air. But something strange is happening - with each piece of guidance I offer, I feel myself absorbing some of their pain physically. My skin begins to glow with their transferred anguish, creating beautiful but painful patterns like stained glass across my arms.

The boundaries between therapist and patient start to blur - literally - as the space between our chairs becomes misty and indistinct. Their memories float between us like little video screens, showing fragments of what brought them here: a wilting wedding bouquet, a child's empty bedroom, a phone call that was never answered.

I reach out to offer comfort, but my hand passes through them like smoke. The room tilts slightly, and gravity seems to shift. Books begin sliding off shelves in slow motion, their pages flying open to reveal not words but butterflies that fill the air with wings made of tissue-thin memories.

The session feels endless and instantaneous all at once, as dream-time bends and folds around us. I am both completely present and somehow watching from above, seeing myself trying to heal someone while the very act of healing transforms us both into something new and undefined...

The dream pulses with empathy and surreal beauty, leaving me with the profound sense that the lines between helping and being helped are far more fluid than we imagine in our waking hours...
