I am dreaming. The first thing I notice is the surreal manipulation of time. It’s as if it’s a malleable substance here, bending and stretching in ways that defy my waking-world logic. In the dream, moments of boredom or idle thought make time accelerate, racing past like a comet's tail, leaving behind only fleeting impressions. Conversely, the more deeply engaged I am, the slower time drags out, each sensation blooming into a lengthy, almost tangible experience.

I find myself standing at the edge of an endless library, its shelves stretching into a vanishing point miles away. The books here are not ordinary—they pulse with a faint, bioluminescent glow, their spines etched with symbols that shift and change when I’m not looking. The air hums with a low-frequency vibration, and the scent of old parchment mingles withsomething metallic, like the air before a thunderstorm.

Curiosity pulls me deeper into the labyrinth of books. I pick up a spineless book—its pages flutter open effortlessly, displaying images instead of text. The book is alive, showing a river under a starless sky. As I touch the pages, I’m suddenly submerged in the dream within the dream: cold water rushes past me, the stars above now constellations I don’t recognize. The flow of time here is so slow that each ripple in the water feels like an eternity. I can watch individual photons from the unfamiliar stars bounce off the water’s surface, their light dancing with a life of its own.

I surface from the book’s dream back in the library, gasping. Time here has compressed; hours seem to have passed elsewhere in just seconds for me. My clothing is dry, but my hands are marked with faintly glowing hieroglyphs—relics from the other realm. 

Further exploration leads me to a section where the books are arranged in a spiral, each volume radiating a different color. Touching one with an azure hue displays a desert wasteland with twin suns hanging in the sky. Engaging with this new scene, I find myself transported once more, the desert’s sands shifting like liquid beneath my feet. Time here is a languid creature, each step taking minutes. The twin suns cast converging shadows, and the dunes sing a haunting melody as the wind passes over them. 

A sandstone archway materializes before me, its entrance glowing with a portal to another dimension. Stepping through, I find myself in a city of floating islands connected by silk bridges. The city thrums with life—its inhabitants are humanoid but with iridescent scales and eyes that glow like embers. Their voices sound like chimes, and they move in harmonious, synchronized patterns, their actions affecting the flow of time around them. When they dance, time around them reverses briefly; when they converse, it stills completely.

In this place, I witness a ritual where the elders gather at the edge of an island. They hold crystalline orbs that pulse in unison, and as they chant, a black hole forms above them but instead of sucking everything in, it exudes a gentle light, shedding time like autumn leaves. Each fragment of shed time becomes a tangible entity—a glowing orb that hovers, pulsating with memories and moments from realities unseen.

I reach for one of the orbs, and my surroundings dissolve once again. This time, I’m in a clockwork cathedral, its gears and pulleys enormous, interlocking with precision. The cathedral has no roof, and the sky is a tapestry of intersecting timelines, each a thread of light weaving through the cosmos. I realize this is the heart of the temporal library, where all experiences of time converge. Gears are notched with dates and events, but some numbers are erased, others duplicated, showing the chaos of subjective time.

A figure materializes before me—ageless, their form shifting between a scholar, a weaver, and a gardener. They explain that the library is a repository of all experienced time, where every engagement with moments threads into the cosmic fabric. They offer me a tool: a chronocrystalline quill that allows me to etch new timelines into the cathedral’s walls. 

With the quill in hand, I hesitate—such power is overwhelming. The figure smiles, a gesture that warps and reforms their features. “You don’t write new time,” they say, “you reflect the potential already there.” 

Suddenly, the cathedral fractures, its walls becoming a cascade of books falling endlessly through a glass sea. I am free-falling, but time dilates around me. Each book I pass offers a glimpse into a life unlived, a choice unmade, a path not taken. The sensations are visceral—a lifetime of joy or sorrow flashing in the blink of an eye. 

I awake moments before hitting the water, gasping in my bed, my hands still glowing faintly with the glyphs from the dream. The remnants of the clockwork cathedral hum in my mind, and I wonder if the dream was a warning, a invitation, or merely an echo of possibilities. Time, I realize, is not a line but a constellation—one I’ve now touched.
