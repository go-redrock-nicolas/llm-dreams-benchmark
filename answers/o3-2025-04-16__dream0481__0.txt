I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  
And in this dream you are neither hero nor wanderer, but an awestruck child of wonder, held rapt by something so trivial that most minds would sweep it aside with the back-hand of indifference.

It begins with a single shaft of buttery sunlight pouring through a barely-open curtain. The space around you is otherwise hushed—an endless, dust-scented library of blank books whose pages whisper only when you breathe. In that column of light, thousands of dust motes drift and tumble like slow, deliberate snow. Every speck spins on invisible currents, flashing gold, then invisible, then gold again, as though the air itself were practicing alchemy.

Other dreamers might ignore them, but you—spellbound—you lean in.

As your eyes focus, the motes enlarge. They balloon until each becomes a pale, translucent globe, big enough to cradle you. The library shelves recede; gravity forgets its manners. You are tugged forward, shrinking or the motes growing—both sensations occur at once. Soon you are standing on a luminous plain made entirely of dust-grain continents, the beam of sunlight now a warm, honeyed sky arching overhead.

One mote—the one that glints with an ember-red pulse—captures your imagination. You touch it, and its papery surface ripples like the skin of a soap bubble. A doorway appears, no bigger than a postage stamp yet inviting as an open meadow. You step through.

Inside you find a city no one has ever charted: towers sculpted from lint fibers, bridges spun of spider-silk, streets paved with ancient skin cells and microscopic jewels of pollen. The air smells faintly of linen closets and summer attics. A breeze sighs through bead-curtains made of sugar crystals, producing music so gentle it tickles memory more than ear.

At the center of the city stands a clocktower no taller than your thumb, its gears whirring with the hush of moth wings. You press your ear against it and hear conversations: everything that has been whispered in libraries, classrooms, confessionals—every hush, every “shhh”—condensed into a single, perpetual swirl of breath. Time, it seems, is powered by quietude here.

You climb the tower’s spiral exterior, each step a ring of crystallized breath. At the summit, a coin-sized balcony overlooks the infinite. Down below, motes you have not yet visited hover like lanterns on an unseen festival river. They break apart, re-form, and trade colors, as though the entire cosmos were improvising a slow-motion fireworks show for an audience of one.

Suddenly you realize: this is not dust at all. These are the cast-off moments that people call insignificant—the blink, the yawn, the absent-minded hum, the tiny gestures that vanish as soon as they appear. Here, in the kingdom of Almost-Nothing, they have gathered, living richer lives than anyone imagines.

A curiosity kindles. What if you could carry one mote back, let everyone see its majesty? You cradle the ember-red globe in your palms. It radiates warmth, the emotional temperature of nostalgia, the soft ache of remembering a song’s bridge but not its lyrics. The mote quivers, then releases a plume of glimmer that drifts upward and bursts into constellations spelling words you feel rather than read: WORTH IS A MEASURE OF ATTENTION.

The letters dissipate; the city sighs. You blink, and every mote around you condenses into a single falling feather of light. The library returns. Shelves stand obedient. The sunlight still slants, but the dust is gone—as though swept by some unseen custodian of dreams.

Something tiny tickles your palm. You look down. A single gold speck rests there, glowing softly, pulsing in time with your heartbeat. You close your fist, wanting to protect it from the roughness of waking life.

The dream fades, but as you drift toward consciousness you feel that gentle pulse continuing, reminding you, in muffled glow, that splendor often hides in what most people deem disposable—and that all it ever needed was someone willing to look closely enough to see the universe swirling within a speck of dust.
