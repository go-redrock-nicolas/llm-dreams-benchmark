I am dreaming. I find myself in a labyrinthine library that stretches infinitely in all directions. Towering bookshelves cast long shadows across marble floors that seem to ripple like water with each step I take. I'm clutching a single sheet of paper—my assignment—that somehow feels heavier than all the countless volumes surrounding me.

The deadline is tomorrow, and I've had months to complete this task. The weight of procrastination sits on my shoulders like a gargoyle, its stone claws digging deeper with each passing hour.

The clock on the wall has hands that move too quickly, sweeping around the face with unnatural speed. Tick-tock, tick-tock—but the sound isn't mechanical. It's more like heartbeats, growing louder and more frantic.

I begin to run through the stacks, searching for the right books, the right references, anything to help me complete my work. But the library keeps changing—corridors shift, shelves rearrange themselves when I turn away. Books I reach for transform into birds and flutter away into the impossibly high ceiling, disappearing into a twilight sky that shouldn't be visible indoors.

Other people study peacefully at tables, their faces oddly blurred, but radiating calm competence. They finished their tasks long ago. When I try to approach them, the distance between us mysteriously expands.

My paper begins to dissolve in my hands, the deadline date glowing red on the dissolving sheet. Panic rises in my throat like bile as I realize I've wasted all my time and now face the consequences of my choices.

The library floor begins to tilt, books sliding from shelves like an avalanche. I'm running uphill now, trying to escape the crushing weight of unfinished obligations...
