I am dreaming. I find myself in a society where conventional logic is considered madness and irrational thinking is the norm. To function in this world, I have to quickly adapt and twist my mind into unfamiliar shapes.

Colors in this bizarre world are not just hues, but tastes and sounds. The sky, rather than blue, is a velvety purple, with a strong taste of dark chocolate and resonate the sound of church bells. As I stroll through the town, I notice that the houses are made of soft sponge, painted with colors that sing in a stunning symphony of notes. 

As I walk down the streets, I find the currency here is emotions. We purchase things with feelings rather than paper or coins. Shops bear signs that say, "Two smiles for a loaf of bread," and, "A clenched fist of determination for a gallon of milk". The world truly appears to be inside-out, making sense in the most nonsensical manner.

The law of gravity works selectively, and I watch people decide when to levitate. They walk for a few steps, float, then return to the ground. Some are bouncing off the walls like characters in a video game, swimming through the air or lounging on clouds that drift by. It is a world of living Dali paintings and Escher sketches.

As night falls in this world, the sun doesn't set – instead, it becomes a tranquil sea of pastel colors and soothing jazz music. Stars are not distant specks of light but brightly colored fireflies that speak in poetic verses when they are caught.

The residents of the town gather for their dinner under a canopy of starlight. The tables are clothed with riddles and puzzles, the food served is one’s greatest fear – which tastes like your favorite meal. Desserts are shared dreams, made of fluffy cotton candy and filled with aspirational thoughts.

My journey ends in a library where books write their own endings, and stories read people to sleep at night. I borrow a book about a character who wakes up into the real world and I begin to read. As the pages turn, I find myself blurring into the story and fading into the backdrop.

Just as quickly as it began, my dream morphs into reality. My eyes open and I awake back in the real world – a realm of structured logic and rational thinking. Yet a part of me can’t help but ponder the absurd beauty and chaotic harmony of the otherworldly dream... one that I eagerly await to explore again in slumber.
