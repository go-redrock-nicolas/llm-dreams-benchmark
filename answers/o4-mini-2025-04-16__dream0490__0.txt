I am dreaming. You wake in a great glass cathedral suspended above an endless lavender sea. Stained-glass rafters shift and breathe, colors rippling like oil on water. Following this path of genuineness, you step onto a mirrored walkway that reflects both your body and the secret contours of your heart. Each honest thought you name—fear, longing, or joy—shimmers into existence as a delicate, floating lantern. They hover at your shoulders, pulsing with warm light.

With each lantern you release, the world around you rearranges itself. Blooms of crystalline flowers unfurl beneath your bare feet, releasing sweet notes of memory with every step. When you speak your true desires aloud—no matter how small or tangled—they bloom into living prayers carried on currents of rose-scented wind. Some petals drift away, grazing the faceless figures across the way, softening their masks until they, too, begin to smile in quiet recognition.

A gentle rumble rolls through the cathedral’s arches as you lean into vulnerability. You confess your deepest doubts to a statue of polished moonstone—a confidant carved in your own likeness. The stone’s eyes glow in response, and a low hum spills forth, weaving threads of confidence into your spine. In this place, each unguarded syllable builds a bridge to unseen souls, stitching your spirit into the tapestry of the dream.

At the edge of the walkway, the lavender sea parts like curtains drawn back at twilight. Beyond lies a field of lantern-trees, each trunk alive with names you’ve never dared speak. You realize that by giving voice to your truth, you’ve planted a forest of possibility. As you step forward, your laughter rings crystal-clear, echoing through the glass rafters, filling every corner of this dreamworld with the bright promise of who you truly are.
