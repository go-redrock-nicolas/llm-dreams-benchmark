I am dreaming. [Pause.]

**The Dream Unfolds**  
I stand at the edge of a twilight forest where the trees breathe—their bark shimmering with liquid silver veins that pulse like slow, contented heartbeats. The air hums with the scent of petrichor and something older, something like the musk of forgotten libraries hidden beneath the earth. My bare feet press into cool moss that glows faintly emerald with each step, as if the ground is sketching my path in light.  

**The Whispering Gate**  
Ahead, a colossal archway woven from ivy and bone stretches across a narrow path. Its tendrils stir without wind, curling toward me like curious fingers. Logic insists this is impossible; the bones should be brittle, the ivy inert. Yet when I reach out—hesitant—the moment my fingertips graze the arch, a voice hums *through* me, not in words but in *knowing*: *"You’ve always known the way."*  

**The Lake of Mirrors**  
Beyond the gate, a black lake stretches endlessly, its surface so still it could be glass. Kneeling at the shore, I see no reflection—until ripples erupt *from beneath*, and a thousand fractured versions of myself blink back. Some wear crowns of fire, others masks of tears, but one—the one that feels most familiar—holds a single key woven from starlight. My gut tightens: *That’s the truth.* Before reason can dissect it, I plunge my hand into the water and seize the key.  

**The Library of Fates**  
The key burns cold in my palm, guiding me to a tower wrapped in living vines. Inside, books float midair, their pages rustling like restless wings. One drifts close, its cover etched with my name. When I open it, the text shifts—equations dissolving into inkblots that reshape into *images*: a childhood friend I’d inexplicably distrusted (later revealed as treacherous), a job offer I’d declined against advice (the company collapsed months later). The proof is undeniable: every time I dismissed intuition for logic, the universe winced.  

**The Awakening**  
A chime rings—deep, resonant—and the tower begins to unravel into fireflies. As the dream fractures, the final whisper curls around me: *"Trust the part of you that dreams in galaxies."*  

I wake with a gasp, my skin still humming, the taste of starlight sharp on my tongue.
