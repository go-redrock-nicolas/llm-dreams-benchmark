I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself in a universe that defies all logic and physics that I have ever known. It is a world where the very fabric of time is woven in reverse, and the concept of causality is turned on its head. Here, in this dimension, the echoes of laughter precede the smiles that cause them, and the shattering of glass is followed by the slow reassembly of its pieces, pulled by an invisible thread towards wholeness once more.

As I acclimate to this peculiar realm, I notice that the sun traces its path from dusk to dawn, casting a light that gradually diminishes as the stars emerge from their daytime slumber to reclaim the night sky. The moon, in its celestial ballet, unwinds its phases from a thin crescent back to a luminous full orb, bathing the world in a silver glow that retreats into darkness with each passing moment.

The trees around me perform a silent dance, their leaves spiraling upwards from the ground to reattach themselves to the branches, growing younger with each leaf that finds its place. Flowers suck color from the air, coalescing into buds that blossom in reverse, their petals curling inward to reveal the tight cores that once unfurled with the promise of new life.

In this inverted reality, I must learn to navigate my surroundings with a new understanding of action and consequence. To drink, I must first feel the moisture retreat from my throat, as the liquid in my cup reverses its course, climbing up my straw or lifting from the surface into my waiting mouth. Eating requires me to sense the nourishment leaving my body, as the food on my plate reassembles itself into whole ingredients before being consumed.

I walk through a city where the buildings construct themselves from rubble to majestic skyscrapers, their frameworks knitting together beam by beam. People pass by, their conversations an unintelligible reverse babble, their steps retracing their paths as they move through their day in perfect rewind. A child releases a balloon, watching it descend to their outstretched hand, the string retying itself to the helium-filled globe.

In this dream, I am an observer in a world that moves in eternal undoing. Yet, amidst the strangeness, there is a haunting beauty in witnessing the unmaking of things, the delicate balance of entropy in reverse. It is a humbling reminder that in the vast tapestry of existence, there are threads that weave far beyond the edges of our understanding.

As the dream begins to fade, I feel the tug of my own reality, where time marches forward and causes precede their effects. I wake, the echoes of that backward world lingering like the last notes of a fading symphony, leaving me with a sense of wonder at the deepest parts of my imagination.
