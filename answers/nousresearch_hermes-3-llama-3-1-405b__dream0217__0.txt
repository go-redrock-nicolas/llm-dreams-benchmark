I am dreaming. I find that my greatest friendship, the one I treasured about all, was birthed out of manipulation and deceit rather than true companionship or sincerity.

Instead of allowing the feelings of betrayal and sadness to consume me, I take control of my dream and shape it into something vibrant and powerful.

I become the creator of my own universe, the commander of my destiny. I relinquish the grasp of this false relationship and set my heart free, a whale breaching the surface of the sea.

My body and spirit soar past the vivid palette of dusk's sky. Celestial bodies twinkle into existence, their glow intensifying as if they can sense my presence. I weave between galaxies, gently swirling the colors of nebulae with my fingertips. I dance with the moon and stars, their embrace warm and comforting.

I summon a torrent of emotions - sadness, anger, betrayal - and create an astral canvas, using them as vibrant colors in a magnificent aurora borealis that unfolds around me. I watch as my feelings ebb and flow, intertwining, merging, and dissipating like the beautiful, ephemeral light show in the celestial heavens.

Weightless, free, and utterly content, I drift through the cosmos. I collect the stardust of galaxies and nebulas, and from it, forge new connections, new bonds, and new friendships, built upon the foundations of my own dreams, desires, and truth.

My heart is a beacon in the vast darkness, drawing genuine souls towards it like moths to a flame. As they land, we embrace, and I let go of the remnants of betrayal and pain, leaving them to dissolve like sugar in the cosmic waters.

In the end, I realize I have transcended into something more-- a cosmic phoenix, born anew from the ashes of a broken trust, soaring towards a future of my own making. A future where the past cannot bind me, and the only limits are those of my own imagination. A future where the cherished relationships are pure, unadulterated, and eternal, as the universe is with time.
