I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself walking through a serene yet enigmatic landscape bathed in hues of deep twilight – a strange fusion of purples, blues, and silvers. The air is thick, carrying the faint scent of unknown blossoms and a quiet hum that vibrates through everything, like a soft electric current pulsing in time with my heartbeat. 

I stumble upon a set of towering stone doors in a cliffside that seems to rise endlessly above. My hand reaches instinctively toward one massive handle, its cold surface rough yet making me feel inexplicably connected to it. As I push the door open, a flood of kaleidoscopic light envelops me, and I step into an expansive chamber. 

The chamber appears to be both infinite and alive. Waves of crystal-like walls ripple as though liquid, reflecting prismatic light that darts around like flames caught in a breeze. Hypnotic patterns spiral across the ceiling, shifting as if whispering secret codes in an unrecognizable language. In the center of this vast room stands a dias adorned with a single glowing pedestal.

On the pedestal lies a glowing orb -- iridescent, its light pulsing faintly, calling me closer. My fingers tremble as they close around it, expecting heat, but it is cool, soothing, almost alive beneath my touch. The moment my skin comes into contact with it, a thousand voices erupt around me, echoing off the crystal walls. They speak all at once, in tongues and dialects I've never heard yet somehow understand, the threads of emotion intertwining into a vibrant tapestry that fills my mind. 

The orb vibrates, and a scene unfolds in my mind’s eye. I am no longer in the chamber but standing before an open field encircled by towering, ancient trees that stretch to the heavens. Beneath these sentinels, figures materialize from the shadows. They are... impossibly diverse. There are beings that shimmer with light, translucent yet solid; others with skin like bark and moss, their hair akin to tree roots twisting into the earth. Some appear human at first glance, but then I notice feathered wings, elongated limbs, iridescent scales sparkling in the dappled sunlight. 

The orb in my hand pulses once, twice – and the scene changes. I’m now standing in the center of an endless desert. The sun burns overhead, casting down unrelenting waves of light, the dunes shifting and undulating beneath my feet as if in time with the orb’s rhythm. The figures reappear, but now their forms seem sharper, more intense, and so impossibly ancient that merely looking at them feels like trying to gaze directly into the sun. Their faces are carved with eons of experience and emotion, deep grooves that give hints of knowing far more than I can fathom. 

A voice rises louder than the others, and I turn to see one being step forward. It is radiant yet terrifying. Its form is indistinct, shifting between something like a person, and then something far from human – scales gleaming like molten gold, eyes that flicker between deep violet and molten crimson. Its voice is both melodic and commanding, and the orb hums louder in my grasp.

"You must walk through one of these gates," the being says, extending an arm toward three paths that materialize from the sand, each leading into the unknown. 

I look to them, drawn to the first path. This path shimmers with copper light, winding into what seems an endless series of arched gates, each one leading somewhere impossibly beautiful and terrifying at the same time. The second path is darker, lined with shadowed trees, their roots twisting into the ground, forming steps as if beckoning me to descend into a world where the very air feels like ash and molten night. The third path, cloaked in mist, is barely visible, its outline barely distinguishable from the desert sands. It is soft, muffled – a world in between worlds.

"Choose," the being says.

In that moment, I realize that the choice is not about paths but about something far deeper, far more fundamental...and yet completely blurred from my waking mind. 

I look down at the orb, feeling its warmth against my skin, its pulse echoing in the air like a heartbeat, the voices of countless beings still whispering in my mind. My hand, weak; the weight of the world I've left behind pressing down on me; my very essence slipping...

And then I jolt awake, a profound sense of eternity clinging to me, the memory of the orb’s light fading from my vision, but its presence lingering in the shadows of my mind like a promise not yet fulfilled.
