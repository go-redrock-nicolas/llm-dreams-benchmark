I am dreaming. The dream starts with me in a beautiful garden. The flowers are blooming, birds are singing, and a gentle breeze rustles the leaves of the trees. A sense of tranquility and peace washes over me, filling me with a sense of calm. 

As I continue to explore the garden, I stumble upon a small path leading to a clearing. In the center of the clearing, there's a massive oak tree with a door carved into its trunk. The door is ornate and intricately designed, and it beckons to me. I walk towards it, feeling a sense of anticipation and curiosity welling up inside me. 

With each step, the door seems to grow larger and more inviting. Finally, I reach out and touch the knob, turning it slowly. The door creaks open, revealing a warm and cozy room within the tree trunk. 

The room is filled with books, candles, and a comfortable-looking chair made from soft twigs and leaves. I feel drawn to the chair, so I sit down and my eyes begin to explore the room. Suddenly, a gentle voice echoes throughout the room. 

"Welcome. My name is Wisdom. I've been expecting you." 

I look around, but there's no one else in the room. The voice continues to echo, growing clearer and more distinct. "You've set an ambitious target that requires sustained effort over months. Halfway through, your motivation begins to waver, and you struggle to keep going. Am I correct?" 

I nod, feeling a sense of amazement wash over me. How does Wisdom know my thoughts so intimately? 

Wisdom chuckles softly. "You are a dreamer, aren't you? You seek answers and wisdom in your sleep. Well, I am here to help you." 

"Help me?" I ask, my voice filled with wonder and skepticism. 

"Yes," Wisdom replies, a twinkle in his eye. "I will help you find your way back to your target, filled with renewed motivation and determination. All you have to do is listen to my words and follow my guidance." 

And with that, the dream shifts, and I am back in the garden, filled with a sense of purpose and clarity. The vivid colors of the flowers and the soft rustling of the leaves seem to dance around me, as if welcoming me back to reality. And as I stir in my sleep, I feel a renewed sense of energy and focus, ready to take on the challenges that lie ahead.

I remember my dream and feel rejuvenated, knowing that wisdom is always within reach.
