I am dreaming. I step forward onto the vast stage of a grand amphitheater, bathed in a surreal golden light that seems to pulse from some unseen source high above. The theater is ancient and ornate, its walls carved with intricate symbols that shift and whisper when I try to focus on them. The audience before me is vast—an ocean of shadowy figures draped in flowing robes, their faces shifting like liquid mirages, sometimes familiar, sometimes utterly alien. A hush falls over them, a silence so thick I can hear my own heartbeat echoing in my ears.

I open my mouth to speak, but instead of words, luminous butterflies flutter from my lips. Each one carries a flicker of an idea, a burst of light that morphs midair into a language I don’t recognize yet somehow understand. The audience murmurs as the butterflies alight on their outstretched palms, dissolving into sparks that race up their arms like tiny comets.

The stage beneath me trembles, and roots burst through the marble, twisting upward into gnarled trees with leaves made of stained glass. Voices rise from the crowd—whispers in a thousand tongues—yet they weave together into a single, haunting melody that coils around me, pulling me deeper into the dream.

One figure in the front row stands, their cloak falling away to reveal a face that is no face at all—only a swirling galaxy with nebulae for eyes. They lift their arms, and suddenly, the amphitheater unravels around me, its pillars dissolving into cascading stardust. I am left floating in the void, my unsaid speech now a constellation forming above me, glowing with all the truth I’ve ever wanted to share. The dream pulses, and I realize—the audience was never really there. I’ve been speaking to myself all along.
