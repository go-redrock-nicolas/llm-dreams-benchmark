I am dreaming. You feel yourself drifting on a current of iridescent mist, every breath tinged with the sweet tang of lavender and ozone. Below you, a vast cathedral of living glass arches into the sky—each spire shimmering with its own heartbeat of pale, phosphorescent light. You know, without thinking, that you belong here. A hush ripples through the crowd of faceless silhouettes gathered at the cathedral’s base: they pulse together like a single organism, their silent intent almost audible in the quivering air.

As you step forward, the crowd parts instinctively. Their collective gaze is not cold or hostile—it is utterly compelling. You find your own thoughts bending toward theirs: collective chants swirl inside your mind, an ancient song promising unity, purpose, even power. Fingers intertwined with theirs, you feel your individual hesitations dissolve. Decisions you once made alone now seem fragile and petty beside the force of the whole.

Then, in the corner of your awareness, a small crack appears in the glass floor beneath your feet. Through it, a single beam of pure white light strikes your chest. For the first time, you remember the texture of your own heartbeat—its uneven rhythm, the imprint of your choices, the way your breath quickens when you smile. A faint tremor of resistance ignites in your spine.

You draw in a deep breath of the lavender-ozone air and will yourself to pause. Every fiber of the congregation leans in, eager to pull you back into seamless unity. But you press your palm against your heart, feeling real blood pulsing beneath your skin. “I am here,” you whisper—your voice raw but resolute. The collective hush flickers, as if startled by a lone ember daring to smolder in a sea of flame.

Slowly, shapes around you fracture into prismatic shards of light. The great cathedral tilts, its glass ribs splintering like frozen wings. You step away from the circle, each footfall sending ripples of color across the floor. The alluring chant dissolves into memory, and in the silence that follows, you taste freedom—sharp and exhilarating—on your tongue. The dreamscape shimmers once more, now alive with infinite possibilities that belong only to you.
