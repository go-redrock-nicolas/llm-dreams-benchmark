I am dreaming. I feel alive again in this world full of possibilities. 
I open my eyes and see a beautiful landscape filled with green trees and blue lakes. I stretch my arms and legs, feeling the warmth of the sun on my skin. I hear birds chirping and insects buzzing around me. I smell fresh air and flowers blooming all around me.
I sit up and realize I am in a bed made out of grass.  The mattress is soft and comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud.  The pillows are filled with feathers and cotton, making my head rest easy.  The sheets are made out of silk and lace, caressing my body gently.
I look around and see no one else except myself.  I am alone in this dream world, but I don't feel lonely at all.   I am happy and free, able to do whatever I want without any restrictions or judgments from others.
I wonder who changed the rules of society overnight and why they did so.  Did they get tired of seeing people argue and fight over trivial things?  Did they get fed up with seeing people ignore their true feelings and desires?  Did they get sick of seeing people waste their time and energy on meaningless activities?
I decide to explore this dream world and see what else it has to offer me.   I stand up and walk barefoot on the grass, feeling its texture underneath my feet.  I reach out my hands and touch the trees, feeling their rough bark against my skin.  I bend down and pick some flowers, smelling their fragrance into my nose.
As I continue walking, I encounter many interesting things along the way:
A river where I can swim and float on the water for hours without getting tired.
A cave where I can hide from anyone who might disturb me
A mountain where I can climb and see the view of distant lands
An ancient temple where I can pray and seek guidance from higher powers
A market where I can buy goods and products that don't exist in reality
A library where I can read books written by authors who never lived
A theater where I can watch plays performed by actors who aren't human
I stop for a while and listen to the sounds of nature around me.  I close my eyes and feel the breeze blowing against my face.  I smile inside and out, realizing how lucky I am to experience this dream world.
Then suddenly, I hear a voice calling my name from somewhere in the distance.  It sounds familiar but also unfamiliar at the same time.  It sounds like someone who knows me well but has never met me before.
