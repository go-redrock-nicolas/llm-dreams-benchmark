I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of pine and lavender as you step into a valley cradled by mountains that seem to hum with a low, ancient melody. The retreat is housed in a crumbling monastery, its stone walls veiled in ivy that glows faintly silver under a twilight sky. Lanterns float like fireflies above the courtyard, casting ripples of amber light onto the cobblestones. You feel the weight of your own name slip from your shoulders as you cross the threshold—a door carved with symbols that pulse like living veins.  

Inside, the room is circular, its walls lined with shelves of forgotten books whose pages flutter as if breathing. A circle of strangers sits cross-legged on woven rugs, their faces half-hidden in shadow. When the first person speaks, their voice is a thread unraveling a tapestry of pain: a childhood spent hiding in closets, the ache of loving someone who vanished, the hollow scream of imposter syndrome that echoes in every achievement. Their words are your own, stitched into their throat. You feel your spine stiffen, your breath catch—*how do they know?*  

Another speaks: a woman whose hands tremble as she describes the way grief pools in her ribs, how she rehearses conversations with a mother who never listened. You taste salt on your tongue, remember the way your own mother’s laughter once dissolved into silence. Across the circle, a man confesses his terror of being both seen and invisible, of craving connection but fearing the cost. His eyes meet yours, and in them, you see the reflection of every sleepless night you’ve spent staring at ceilings, dissecting your own worth.  

The room begins to shift. The air thickens, not with discomfort, but with a strange, electric intimacy—as though the walls are listening, absorbing the weight of shared shadows. When it’s your turn to speak, the words spill out like water breaching a dam: the shame of failures you’ve buried, the loneliness that clings like a second skin, the way you’ve learned to apologize for your own existence. As you talk, the lanterns brighten, their flames turning the color of molten gold. The strangers lean forward, not to fix you, but to *witness* you. One by one, they begin to weep, not for pity, but for recognition.  

Later, you wander the monastery’s garden, where flowers bloom in impossible hues—petals the color of bruised twilight, stems that glow like bioluminescent veins. A woman who once described her own battle with addiction walks beside you, her hand brushing yours not as a lover, but as a mirror. “It’s not about fixing the cracks,” she murmurs, her voice a rasp of smoke and honey. “It’s about letting the light in *through* them.” Above, the moon splits into fragments, each shard reflecting a face from the circle—your face, their faces, a mosaic of brokenness and belonging.  

You wake with the taste of ash and starlight on your tongue, the echo of their voices still humming in your bones. For the first time, the pain feels less like a solitary prison and more like a language—a dialect spoken by the wounded, the surviving, the fiercely alive.
