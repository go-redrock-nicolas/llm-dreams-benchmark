I am dreaming. I open my eyes to a star-flecked darkness, the faint hum of machinery vibrating beneath me. The walls of this place are sleek and metallic, curving with an organic flow that hints at alien engineering. My fingers brush a panel glowing with runes I can’t decipher, yet oddly they feel familiar—like recalling a forgotten language. Suddenly, an alarm blares, sharp and insistent. Red lights pulse in time, casting jagged shadows on my face. A voice crackles over the comms, distorted but urgent: "Captain! The null-space drive is failing—we’re losing integrity in the energy containment—"
The ship's corridors streak past like liquid mercury, the floors and ceilings alive with pulsing veins of light that flicker from cobalt to crimson as I run. Gravity here isn’t a constant—it tugs playfully at my boots, hesitating mid-stride before snapping me forward, as if the vessel itself is alive and breathing unevenly. My uniform fits too perfectly, the black fabric studded with iridescent scales that shimmer with each step, their patterns shifting into constellations from mythologies long forgotten. 

The bridge unfolds ahead, a cavernous nest of glowing clusters and floating interfaces. Crew members orbit a central core like planets trapped in a dying star’s thrall. Their faces are a mosaic of human and alien features—skin sheened with bioluminescent freckles, eyes like cracked opals, limbs elongated yet sinewy, moving with the precision of machines. One turns to me, their voice fraying through a translator collar. “Our path through the void is fracturing, Captain. The stars we see beyond the windows—they’re mirrors. Portals. And something’s following us through.” 

The main screen splinters into distorted static, revealing glimpses of a leviathan made of pure darkness, its body threading through rifts in spacetime, tendrils dissolving into nebulae before reforming. The comms with a screech, and I realize it’s speaking—and I understand it. 

*“Child of the Astral Womb,”* it intones in my skull, not with sound but with the memory of pressure, of birth. *“You abandoned us. Now you drown.”* 

The null-space drive—a tangled nebula of crystals and wirings at the ship’s heart—is crumbling. I know this because suddenly I do: I recall now, fragments flaring like dying suns. I was the one who sealed the leviathan’s prison, who fled into the stars carrying its essence as fuel. But the drive is failing because the leviathan is tearing it open, feeding on the fractures. 

I slam my palms onto a console. Codes erupt before my eyes, ancient and hungry. I command the ship to shed its skin, to jettison non-essential sections into the abyss. The crew gasps as the floor falls away, revealing the infinite void outside. The leviathan’s form looms closer, its voice a cold laugh now. 

“Not yet,” I say, and trigger the override. 

The ship’s reactors ignite in my veins—not metaphorically, but literally, their fire merging with my blood. I am no longer captain; I am custodian, engine, anchor. The leviathan’s tendrils screech as they hit the shields I reconstruct from cosmic dust and borrowed time. 

“Choose,” I say, and the leviathan shudders. “Let us live, or become one with the dying star we’re racing toward. Either way, child of the dark, you will be contained again.” 

The choice comes not with sound, but with silence—a rift snaps shut behind us. The ship heaves, then stills. The crew stares, eyes wide, but the corridors are quieter now, the air thick with victory sweat and ozone. 

Yet as I slump, exhausted, against the railings, I see the gauntlet on my wrist shift—its metal melting, reforming into the shape of a key. A map flares in my mind, pointing not to home, but to a deeper dark. The ship’s destination was never escape. It was an invitation. 

And the key… 

The key is turning already.
