I am dreaming. I am in a large, open meadow with tall grasses that shimmer like gold under a perpetual twilight sky. The air smells faintly of jasmine and burnt sugar. I walk among the grasses, noticing that each blade seems to hum a different note, creating a chorus of soft, melodic vibrations. Ahead, there's a path lined with glowing stones, pulsing like heartbeat. I follow it, and the ground beneath my feet feels both solid and liquid, as though I'm walking on a frozen river that still remembers how to flow.\n\nEventually, the path leads me to a lake so still it looks like polished obsidian. At the water's edge is an island, connected by a bridge of starlight that flickers like Morse code. On the island stands a clock tower with no face, its gears and wheels visible but not turning. A door swings open in the tower, revealing a stairwell that spirals upwards without end.\n\nInside, the walls are lined with mirrors that show not my reflection, but scenes from other lives or possibilities—a version of me playing a harp made of ice, another debating philosophy with a fox wearing spectacles, another building sandcastles that never erode. Each time I try to engage with these images, they dissolve into constellations.\n\nA voice that sounds like wind through crystal asks: "What are you willing to lose to find your new purpose?"\n\nThe stairwell begins to collapse behind me. The constellations above shift, forming a map. I have to choose a constellation to leap toward, each representing a different path forward. I reach for one—a luminous spiral reminiscent of ancient runes—and launch myself into it.  

I wake, breathless, with the taste of stardust on my tongue and a quiet determination to embrace the unknown.
