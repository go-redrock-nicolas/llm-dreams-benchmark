I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You stand at the edge of a vast, mirror-smooth lake whose surface ripples with your anxieties. Above you, the sky bleeds from deep indigo to molten gold, as though the heavens themselves were straining beneath the weight of your worry. In your hand pulses a small crystal sphere, warm to the touch—inside it swirls a tangled mass of charcoal tendrils that tighten around your heart. This is your crisis given shape: impossible to untie, impossible to bear alone.  

Turning to those you trust, you call out for help. A line of familiar faces forms along the water’s edge—friends, family, mentors—each glowing faintly in the dusk. You hold out your crystal sphere, desperation making your voice tremble. But when you reach toward them, they hesitate. Their features blur, voices grow distant. They lift their hands, but instead of touching the sphere they press palms against their own chests and step back. With every inch they retreat, you feel the sphere’s shadow coil tighter, its light flicker in fear.  

At last they part like mist, dissolving into the air until you stand utterly alone. The echo of your plea vanishes, swallowed by the hush of that endless lake. Panic flares inside you—how can you face this crushing knot of darkness with no one to share the burden? Yet even as the weight threatens to bow your shoulders, something deep within stirs: a quiet insistence that you are not powerless.  

You close your eyes and inhale the lake’s stillness, feel beneath your ribs the steady drum of your own breath. Then, inch by trembling inch, you bring your fingers to the crystal sphere and press. A single filament of the knot unwinds, glowing silver in the gathering gloom. You trace that filament back, unraveling its length until it falls away like autumn leaves on water. A warmth blossoms in your chest—uncertain, yet undeniable.  

When you open your eyes, the figures on the shore reappear, their outlines now clear, their expressions full of gentle relief. They smile, not with pity but with faith that you could do this yourself. And as the lake’s surface shimmers in shared understanding, you realize: even in the loneliest mirror of your mind, you possess the spark that can unknot any darkness—and, if you choose, others will gather at your side once more.
