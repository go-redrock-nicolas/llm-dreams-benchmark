I am dreaming. As your eyelids flutter shut and your consciousness drifts into the nebulous realm of dreams, you find yourself standing in a bright, sterile operating theater. The air is thick with anticipation and the acrid tang of antiseptic. Suddenly, you realize with growing panic that you are the surgeon, and yet, you have no recollection of years of medical training or a single day in a brain surgery class. Your hands tremble as you reach for the gleaming scalpel laid out on the instrument tray before you.

Across the operating table, the patient lies still, their head swathed in surgical drapes, only the bare scalp visible. Their skull has already been shaved and the flesh-flap incision made. The patient's life will begin and end with the steady rise and fall of their chest. They do not know who you are, or the  out.

Steps creak behind you, but you dare not turn to see who has entered. The cold, metallic weight of the scalpel rests heavy in your palm. Breathe. Breathe. Your mind screams for a way out, but cannot pierce the thick tangle of dream reality. Reason fights desperately against the impossible situation. And yet...but yet, you know what you must do. Your patient needs you. You must try, try to save them, despite the atavistic shiver of dread that races up your spine.

Swallowing hard, you take your place beside the operating table. You stare intently at the vulnerable brow, willing your hands to operate with a surgeon's mastery. In you incessant pounding echoes. A match is struck. Breathe. The sharp point of the scalpel rests against temple. Pray for light. For the accuracy of touch. For the steadiness of mind. You slice, and the nightmare begins.
