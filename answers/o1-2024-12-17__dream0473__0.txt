I am dreaming. …draw in a slow, steady breath, and feel your lungs expand with the soft, golden glow of possibility. The hum of incessant notifications fades into the distance, like a radio station drifting out of range. You find yourself standing on a vast, shifting shore, the sand composed not of grains, but of tiny digital zeros and ones that sparkle like fireflies at twilight. Every step you take sends little bursts of code fluttering around your ankles, dancing on a breeze that smells faintly of fresh mint and ancient cedar.

You see a tall, twisting doorway shaped like an old phone screen rising out of the sparkling sand. At first, you hesitate, nearly compelled to gaze into its glowing center, to once again check the endless pinging that tugs at your attention. But instead, you lift your gaze and walk past it, determined. With each step away from that hypnotic glow, the sand around you warms and transforms, shifting from a binary mosaic into soft, powdery dunes that cradle your feet as delicately as clouds. The breeze gently ruffles your hair, whispering to you that this moment—this wild, ever-changing dreamscape—is all that truly exists in the here and now.

Ahead, you spot a grove of trees whose leaves shimmer with shifting images—glimpses of silent videos, half-finished text conversations, and unread messages swirling across their surfaces like ephemeral illusions. Curiosity tugs at you to step closer and glean the secrets hidden in the leaves, but you hold steady. Instead, you reach out a hand, lightly touching a branch. The images dissolve at your touch, fading into dancing sparks of green light that stream upward, twirling into the sky like freed fireflies.

As you let go of the branch, a sense of calm and presence flows through you, as if the hush of an ancient temple has suddenly blanketed this entire realm. You realize you can guide this dream, that every time you resist the allure of those digital whispers, the world around you grows more intricate, more filled with life. Flowers bloom at the base of each shimmering trunk, unfurling petals made of vibrant geometric patterns—bright blues, golds, and delicate purples arranged in kaleidoscopic designs. The trees begin to sway gently, humming with an otherworldly lullaby that resonates in your chest, freeing more fragments of your attention from the digital clamor you left behind. 

You notice a narrow, winding path promising further wonders behind the grove. As you follow it, each footstep feels more grounded and confident, your senses sharpening. You can smell the green sweetness of leaves, hear the crisp snap of twigs beneath your feet, and taste the cool, refreshing air on your tongue. The path leads to an archway carved from smooth marble that seems pulled from some long-lost civilization. There, resting in a small alcove under the arch, is a small, hand-bound journal. 

With reverence, you pick it up and flip through its thick, parchment-like pages. Instead of words, you find painted renderings of scenes that bring you comfort and joy: pictures of loved ones laughing around a table lit by golden candlelight, images of sunlit meadows and trickling waterfalls, and glimpses of your dreams yet to be realized—an endless tapestry of experiences that have no need for push notifications or vibrating phone calls. 

In that moment, you sense the dream shifting from its ethereal haze into a deep, unwavering clarity. The images fill you with gratitude for the present and a renewed intention to hold onto that awareness as tightly as one might cup water in their palms. As the edges of the dream begin to fade, you cling to one last tender thought: that no device can ever truly replace the surge of wonder and calm found in this luminous, boundless world within. And with that, you awaken—heart steady, mind quieter, soul firm in the knowledge that you can stand on that digital shore, see the glow in the distance, but ultimately choose to be here, alive in your own unfolding story.
