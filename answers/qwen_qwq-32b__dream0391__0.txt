I am dreaming. The air smells like burnt sugar and autumn leaves, and the sky is painted in stripes of violet and tangerine. I’m standing on a bridge that’s woven from willow branches, so flexible it sways beneath my feet. Below the bridge, the river flows backward, dragging along silver fish that glow like tiny moons. Suddenly, I notice the others: people from my life—my third-grade teacher, my neighbor’s cat, even my younger self from five years ago—all watching me but not seeing the same wonders. To them, the river flows forward, the bridge is made of metal grates, and the sky is a mundane robin’s egg blue. We all speak, trying to convince each other of our perspectives, but our words dissolve into the wind. I realize this is the heart of human connection—the fragile, shimmering dance of different realities coexisting, misunderstood yet beautiful. I wake up with the echo of the bridge’s creaking song in my ears.
