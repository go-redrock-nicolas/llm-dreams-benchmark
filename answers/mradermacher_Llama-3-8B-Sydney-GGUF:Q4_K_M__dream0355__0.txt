I am dreaming. I'm in a beautiful world full of colors and sounds.  I see flowers blooming, birds singing, and butterflies
flying.  I hear the sound of water flowing, the sound of wind blowing, and the sound of laughter echoing.
I feel happy, free, and curious.  I want to explore this place, learn its secrets, and share it with others.
But then I'm offered some advice that goes against my intuition about an important matter.  A voice tells me "Do what they
want you to do" .   Another voice tells me "Don't do what they want you to do" .   Another voice tells me "Just follow your
heart" .
I don't know who these voices are or where they come from.  I just know that they conflict with each other and with my own
inner voice.
So I decide to test them out.  I start doing what the first voice says: "Do what they want you to do".  But then I realize it's
not what I really want to do.  It's not what makes me happy or free or curious.
I stop and think about why I'm doing this.  Is it because I'm afraid of them?  Is it because I'm obedient?  Is it because I don't
have any better ideas?
No, that can't be it.  That would make me a coward, a slave, a fool.  That would make me less than human.
Maybe I'm doing this because I'm hoping they'll like me or love me or appreciate me if I do what they want me to do.  But that
can't be it either.  That would make me selfish, greedy, pathetic.  That would make me more than human.
I don't know why I'm doing this.  I just know that something inside me isn't satisfied with the answer I've given myself.
And then I hear another voice whispering in my ear: "You can do better than this".
And I believe her.
Because deep down, I know she's right.
