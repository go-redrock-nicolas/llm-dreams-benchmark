I am dreaming. I find myself in a dimly lit urban alleyway where the brick walls seem to pulse with an unsettling, organic quality. Before me, a woman is crumpled against the wall, her shoulders heaving with deep, wracking sobs. Tears stream down her face, catching the strange amber light from above and creating glistening rivers on her cheeks. Her emotional pain is palpable, filling the air like thick smoke.

Yet inside me, there is only a vast, echoing emptiness.

I observe her suffering with the detached curiosity of someone watching fish in an aquarium. My heart doesn't quicken, my throat doesn't tighten, my eyes remain dry. I recognize intellectually that I should feel something - compassion, concern, discomfort - but there is nothing. Just a hollow void where empathy should reside.

This emotional vacancy terrifies me on a profound level, yet even that terror feels academic, theoretical. I study my own hands in the strange light, wondering if I've somehow become disconnected from my own humanity. They look solid enough, but perhaps I am becoming as insubstantial as smoke, my capacity for emotional connection evaporating like morning dew.

The woman's cries grow louder, more desperate, but they might as well be the sound of distant traffic for all they move me. I watch her pain with the same idle interest I might have in reading yesterday's weather report. This detachment feels simultaneously unnatural and oddly familiar, as if I'm remembering something about myself I've always known but tried to forget.

The dream-light grows dimmer, the walls pulse faster, and I remain trapped in this bubble of emotional isolation, a spectator to suffering but never a participant in the great human dance of shared feeling and compassion. The revelation of my own emotional void becomes the true nightmare, more disturbing than any monster could be.
