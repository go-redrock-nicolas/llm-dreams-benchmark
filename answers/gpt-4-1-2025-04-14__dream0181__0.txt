I am dreaming. —I am standing atop a dizzyingly tall, spiraling staircase carved into a mountain of amethyst. Moonlight pours through crystalline windows, smattering the floor with shifting, violet mosaics. The air shimmers with possibility. An ancient figure in a robe woven with constellations presses an orb of swirling light into my hands, murmuring in a tongue that dances between my thoughts. Suddenly, the hall is full—row upon row of advisors bowing and glaring, their eyes agleam like polished agates. I’ve been chosen, declared Sovereign Arbiter of the Realms, but the weight of countless incredulous gazes crushes my breath.

I try to speak, but my words billow from my lips as colored smoke, twisting into impossible shapes that seem both familiar and foreign. The council—weathered wizards, wise-eyed fauns, and stony-faced drakes—exchange skeptical glances. I feel the tremor of doubt quivering at the edge of their trust. “She knows nothing of the Moon-Laws,” an elderly satyr snorts, tapping a cracked hoof impatiently. “No Song of Rivers! No Chronicle of Leaves!” hisses a woman with bark for skin. 

But the orb in my hands pulses with warmth—comforting, insistent, alive. I close my eyes and feel its light spilling through my veins, whispering secret histories, melodies of forgotten rivers, the very heartbeat of the land. When I open my mouth again, my voice is braided with thunder and rain. ‘Let’s begin not with might or rules but with wonder. Show me what you protect, what you fear, what you love.’

Slowly—grudgingly—a fox in a scholar’s cap brings me a sapling sprouting midnight flowers; a librarian dragon unrolls a map shimmering with living currents. Gently, I cradle each gift, listen to each voice—letting my ignorance melt into curiosity, my uncertainty into awe.

The wind outside howls, spinning the spires of my dream fortress higher, illuminating faces etched with hope and wariness alike. Together, we begin—not from authority granted, but authority born of connection, the orb now glowing as if alive between cupped hands, casting galaxies across the dreaming world.
