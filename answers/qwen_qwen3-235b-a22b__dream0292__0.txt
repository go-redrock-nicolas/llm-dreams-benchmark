I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of petrichor—rain on ancient stone—as you stand at the edge of a chasm that splits the earth like a scar. Below, a river of liquid obsidian churns, its surface flickering with ghostly faces and forgotten memories. You remember falling here, once: the weight of failure, the shattering of plans, the way the world seemed to close its eyes to your pain. But now, your hands press into the soil, and the ground responds. Cracks in the rock bloom with veins of sapphire light, weaving together like a mending heart.  

A sound like a thousand hummingbird wings fills the air. Above you, the sky unravels—a tapestry of storm clouds parting to reveal a firmament stitched with constellations you’ve never seen. They pulse in rhythms that match your breath. From the chasm rises a creature of living amber, its body a lattice of glowing resin and iridescent beetle wings. It has no name, but you know it is the architect of reinvention. It coils around you, not as a threat, but as an invitation.  

You climb onto its back, and it launches into the sky, tearing through the clouds like paper. Below, the scarred earth transforms: the obsidian river crystallizes into a mosaic of prismatic glass, reflecting a hundred versions of you—some weeping, some laughing, all of them whole. The creature spirals upward until you’re adrift in a nebula of golden dust, where stars germinate like seeds and burst into bloom. You pluck one, and it hums a lullaby in your palm—a song of all the things you thought you’d never become.  

Suddenly, you’re standing in a library carved from a single glacier. The walls are shelves holding vials of liquid time: iced storms, molten dawns, the exact moment you first learned to walk. A librarian with antlers made of clock hands offers you a vial labeled *“The Hour You Chose Yourself.”* You drink it, and your body dissolves into a flock of emerald moths, each carrying a fragment of your old fears. They disperse into the void, becoming fertilizer for new stars.  

The dream shifts again. You’re in a ballroom suspended over an abyss, dancing with a partner whose face is a mirror. The music is the sound of glaciers calving and forests catching fire. With every step, your feet leave trails of moss and wildflowers. The mirror shows not your face, but a child releasing a dandelion clock into the wind—each seed a wish you’d buried. You laugh, and the sound shatters the mirror into a thousand butterflies.  

When the phoenix from your earlier dream appears now, it’s not as a savior but a peer. Its feathers are duller, yours brighter. You soar together, trailing comet dust, until the horizon folds like origami into a door. Beyond it, a meadow stretches endlessly, dotted with trees whose roots plunge into clouds. Their fruit glows like lanterns, each one containing a question you once thought unanswerable. You bite into one—its juice is the taste of forgiveness, sharp and sweet—and wake just as the first rays of dawn pierce the veil of night.  

Your cheeks are wet. Your heart is full. The setback? A forgotten ember. You are the forest that grew from the ashes, the song that outlasts the silence.
