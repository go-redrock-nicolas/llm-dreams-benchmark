I am dreaming. 

In my dream, I am living in a world where humans have evolved to live underwater. The sky is a deep shade of blue, and the ocean is a dark, mysterious place that is full of life. I am a scientist, and I am on a mission to explore the depths of the ocean and discover new species of marine life. 

As I descend into the water, I feel a sense of peace and calm wash over me. The water is cool and refreshing, and I can hear the sounds of the ocean all around me. I see vibrant coral reefs, schools of colorful fish, and strange, bioluminescent creatures that I have never seen before.

My mission is to find a rare species of jellyfish that is said to hold the key to curing a deadly disease. I have been searching for weeks, but I have not found any trace of it yet. I am beginning to feel discouraged, but I refuse to give up.

One day, as I am exploring a particularly deep part of the ocean, I see something shimmering in the distance. I swim closer, and to my surprise, I see the jellyfish I have been searching for. It is a beautiful creature, with long, flowing tentacles that glow in the dark.

I carefully collect a sample of the jellyfish, and as I begin to ascend back to the surface, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. I know that this discovery will change the world, and I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of it.

As I emerge from the water and take my first breath of fresh air, I wake up from my dream. I feel energized and inspired, and I know that I have a renewed sense of purpose in my waking life. I am ready to take on whatever challenges come my way, knowing that I have the strength and determination to succeed.
