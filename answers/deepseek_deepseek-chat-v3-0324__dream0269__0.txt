I am dreaming. **The Dream:**  

You find yourself standing in an endless, gilded library where the air hums with a faint, whispering static—like the rustling of unseen pages. The walls stretch into shadowed infinity, lined with towering shelves of ancient tomes bound in cracked leather and delicate vellum. Their spines shimmer with ethereal glyphs that shift when you try to read them, their meanings always just out of reach.  

Before you lies an enormous desk of blackened oak, strewn with scrolls of parchment that glow faintly, as if illuminated by unseen candlelight. The document in front of you is impossibly dense—ink swirls in hypnotic patterns, shifting between languages you know and others that seem to pull at the edges of your memory. You sense, deep in your bones, that hidden within this labyrinth of words is a single, crucial detail—something overlooked could unravel everything.  

Your fingers trace the lines, and as you do, the text breathes—some letters sinking into the page while others rise like mist. A distant ache pulses behind your eyes; your vision blurs, then sharpens, revealing hidden annotations curling like vines at the margins. One phrase flickers insistently—**"Beware the seventh permutation"**—before dissolving into the parchment.  

Suddenly, the air grows heavy. The whispers grow louder, forming half-heard warnings. The library’s shadows stretch unnaturally long, and you feel unseen eyes upon you. Time is slipping. A clock you never noticed begins tolling a slow, dissonant chime.  

With each passing second, the words rearrange themselves, taunting you. You *must* find the seventh permutation—but the harder you focus, the more the document resists. Then, at the edge of comprehension, you feel it—an elusive thread of meaning. You *almost* grasp it when—  

—you wake, the taste of ink on your tongue and the weight of something vital slipping away.
