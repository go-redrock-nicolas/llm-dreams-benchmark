I am dreaming. I find myself in a vibrant, ethereal forest where everything glows with a soft, otherworldly light. The trees tower above me, their trunks smooth and luminous, with pulsing colors that shift and undulate in hypnotic patterns. As I breathe, I notice that the air itself sparkles with tiny motes of light, like cosmic dust suspended in the atmosphere.

But there's a peculiar feeling gnawing at the edges of my consciousness. I glance down and see that somewhere in this dream realm, I've acquired a translucent smartphone that floats above the ground. It's calling to me, its screen displaying an endless stream of notifications, each one promising something more important, more urgent than the last.

As I reach for the ghostly device, tendrils of light writhe around my hand, trying to pull me back. But I find my fingers moving magnetically towards the screen, the digital siren song too tempting to resist. I start scrolling through an infinite feed, my mind getting lost in a maze of updates, likes, and shares.

Suddenly, the forest around me transforms. The radiant trees darken, their surfaces cracking and peeling away to reveal dull, grey stone beneath. The dancing lights in the air coalesce into hazy outlines, taking on the form of countless other people, all of them similarly entranced by their own glowing screens. I realize I'm not alone in this trap.

With a jolt of lucidity, I recall the book I once read about the neuroscience of digital addiction. I remember how researchers described the part of the brain that processes novelty, and how constant information feeds hijack that system. I summon my willpower and exert control over my digital self, to break free from this compulsive loop.
