I am dreaming. …freeze—yet it is not the rigid paralysis of fear but the charged stillness of a thundercloud moments before it splits the sky.  
Around you, the debate hall tilts and stretches like warm wax. Marble columns ripple into ivory waterfalls; chandelier crystals drift loose, tinkling like wind chimes in slow motion. Voices elongate into cello notes. And standing five paces away, the provocateur smirks—a grin sharp as broken glass—having just flung that stinging, well-aimed insult meant to shatter your composure.

You feel the insult land. It’s as if a comet has struck the center of your chest: first the blinding flare, then a widening shockwave of emotion—anger braided with hurt, shot through with sparks of disbelief. The room inhales. Time dilates.

Yet because this is a dream, you hold a secret power: you can step outside the blast radius of your feelings and watch them swirl like colored smoke. In one deliberate breath you do exactly that. You extend your hand, palm upward, and the smoke—crimson for rage, indigo for sorrow, gold for pride—collects into a spinning orb above your fingers. It hums with electricity. The hall, suddenly silent, waits for your next move.

Instead of whipping the orb back as a weapon, you press it gently against your sternum and absorb it. The colors pour inward, pulsing through veins that glow beneath your skin. Anger becomes orange wildfire running down your arms; sorrow melts into rain that cools the flames; pride solidifies into a luminous spine of silver light. You are no longer on the verge of losing control—you are luminous with it.

“Words are flint,” you say, your voice echoing with layered harmonies. “I choose whether they spark a wildfire or a beacon.”

The smirking opponent falters, expression flickering. Around them, the rippling columns straighten, the floating crystals click back into place, and a hush spreads across the hall like velvet. Your calm is thunderous. Their insult, which was meant to pierce, now hangs in the air like a moth with singed wings, irrelevant.

Then, the ceiling peels away. Stars spiral downward, orbiting your shoulders like fireflies with cosmic ancestry. Constellations rearrange to spell a single word—FORGIVEN—before dissolving into iridescent petals that tumble gently to the marble floor. Each petal that lands becomes a new seed of discourse: curiosity, nuance, humility.

You step forward and speak again, and this time your words are lanterns floating into midnight water. They invite rather than antagonize. The entire debate transforms: podiums morph into long wooden tables laden with bread, salt, and pomegranates—foods of covenant and conversation. The audience is no longer adversaries; they are travelers sharing a campfire under a limitless sky.

The provocateur’s shoulders drop. They look smaller now, less like a looming threat and more like someone afraid of being unheard. You offer them a seat, a cup of something warm that smells faintly of cedar and cardamom. They accept, revealing unspoken questions in the tremor of their hands.

As dialogue flows, the hall reshapes again: walls unfurl into open horizons, carpets sprout grass, and dawn spills across the scene in slow-motion gold. The debate, once a battlefield, has become a shared sunrise.

At that exact moment, a soft vibration tugs at the edge of your dream—an alarm clock far away in the waking world. You feel the dream dissolve: columns fade, grass turns to bedsheets, starlight flickers into morning sun. But you carry something back—a warm ember where anger used to be, the memory of transmuting fury into illumination.

You open your eyes, still tasting cardamom on your breath, and understand that even awake, insults can be flint—and you can be the alchemist who decides whether they kindle ruin or radiant fire.
