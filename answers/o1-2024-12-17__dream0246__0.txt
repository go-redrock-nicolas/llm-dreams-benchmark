I am dreaming. …brace yourself against a jagged outcropping of rock, heart pounding like frantic drumbeats echoing through the silent expanse of white. The sky above is leaden, a swirling canvas of ash-colored clouds blurred by whirling flakes, and the entire slope—once serenely majestic—seems to grow restless beneath your feet, like a hibernating giant stirring awake. 

You press a trembling hand into the snow, feeling it shift under your palm, alarmingly soft and heavy. It’s as if the mountain has been hollowed out by centuries of secret cracks and half-voiced rumbles. There is an electric tingle in the air, a static fizz that raises the hair on the back of your neck. Suddenly, a web of slender, splintering lines darts across the slope, ragged white scars blurred by blowing drifts. A foreboding hum resonates through the snowpack—then the top layer of snow tears open.

It’s at this instant you realize there’s no outrunning it. The massive slab teeters for a heartbeat before lurching forward. You feel your body weight shift, gravity liquefying beneath you. Snow and ice fragments surge as if possessed by a frigid tidal wave. In slow motion, you watch entire sections of the slope peel away: a heaving, crystalline ocean of snow roaring downward, swallowing everything in its path.

Adrenaline flashes behind your eyes. You claw defiantly at the freezing air, fighting to keep a lungful of breath, as the avalanche bursts around you. It’s a tidal roar, deafening and all-consuming, and in its chaos you can taste the metallic tang of fear. Icy shards pelt your face like glass splinters. You twist and turn, every muscle aflame, desperate to remain at the surface as white and gray swirl in a hostile blur. 

Suddenly, there’s silence. Too silent. It is as if the entire world has been muted under a suffocating veil of snow. You’re half-buried, coughed out by the avalanche’s tide, the rest of your body pinned in the cold embrace of packed debris. It’s darker now, an unnatural twilight cast by the thick, churning clouds overhead. Breathing becomes shallow and tight. Each exhalation forms a weak vapor cloud that hangs before your eyes like a ghost of hope. You struggle to move, any movement, muscling through snow that feels like wet cement clinging to your limbs.

In your half-lucid dream state, you summon a surge of strength. You imagine the warmth of sunlight on your face, the comforting glow of life just beyond the snowy tomb. With your free arm, you fling away the crusty shavings pressing down on your chest. Your heartbeat hammers in your ears, counting each breath as a gift. The sky groans again overhead, and the snow shifts with a sickening crunch. Your heart lurches.

Through a fleeting gap in the clouds, a sliver of pale light breaks through, catching the spindrift in a shimmering dance. The world beyond is a white desert—beautiful in its desolation, dangerous in its stillness. You push and thrash, fighting to emerge before the next surge cuts you off from precious oxygen. The air smells thick with your own panic and adrenaline. 

As the final bits of snow fall away, you break free, exhaling a ragged breath that crystallizes in the air. On the horizon, colossal peaks loom like silent sentinels, their icy crowns reflecting the weak winter sun. You look back at the path of churning destruction behind you, where deep fissures mar the face of the slope. The dream’s edges flicker, shifting images near the periphery like phantoms. 

A new quake echoes from somewhere deep below the mountain’s bones—distant and ominous. But for now, you’re free. You stand swaying on the snow-caked threshold of another dimension, feeling the rumbling heartbeat of a land both mesmerizing and merciless. And in the hush that settles, your pulse slows, serenity blending with lingering fear. 

Then the dream dissolves, slipping from your grasp, and the avalanche’s roar recedes into echoes… into memory.
