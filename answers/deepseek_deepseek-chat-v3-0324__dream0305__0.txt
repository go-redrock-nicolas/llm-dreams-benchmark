I am dreaming. A black ocean stretches beneath me, its surface shimmering with the luminescent silver glow of bioluminescent plankton. The night sky above is a vast expanse of swirling nebulae, constellations pulsing like slow, knowing breaths. I stand on a bridge made of glass, transparent and fragile beneath my bare feet, as though it might dissolve at any moment. Below, the water churns with unseen movement, deep currents weaving secrets into the dark.

Then—a figure emerges from the shadows at the other end of the bridge. A tall, slender being, neither man nor woman, with elongated limbs and skin like polished obsidian, reflecting the stars above. They hold something cradled in their arms—a small creature, featherless and trembling, with enormous, liquid eyes that flicker with intelligence too deep for its fragile body. The figure strokes the creature's back, murmuring to it in a language of rustling leaves and distant thunder. And then, with deliberate, unhurried cruelty, they tighten their grip—

A crack. A whimper. The small body goes limp.

The figure drops it into the water without ceremony. The ocean swallows it whole.

My stomach twists. The violation of it—the casual destruction of something helpless, something trusting—sends a white-hot bolt of fury through me. The glass beneath my feet trembles, vibrating with my rage. The stars above flicker like candle flames in a sudden wind.

I step forward. The figure turns to me, their face smooth, expressionless. "Why?" I demand, my voice echoing across the water, louder than I intended. "It was innocent. It trusted you."

The figure tilts their head. "Does that matter?" they reply, their voice a chorus of whispers. "Everything ends. Everything is consumed. Even you."

The bridge shudders. The glass splinters beneath us, cracks spiderwebbing outward. I feel the abyss yawning below, hungry, infinite. But I don’t step back. Instead, I reach out—not to strike, not yet, but to *understand*. My fingers brush their arm, and suddenly—

I am drowning in their memories.

A thousand lifetimes of watching things die. A thousand lifetimes of being the hand that crushes, the voice that deceives, the shadow that consumes. Not out of malice, but because it is their nature. Because the universe demands balance, and they are the instrument of its will. The creature’s death was not cruelty—it was inevitability.

I wrench myself away, gasping. The figure watches me, waiting.

The glass is still cracking. The ocean is rising.

What do I do?
