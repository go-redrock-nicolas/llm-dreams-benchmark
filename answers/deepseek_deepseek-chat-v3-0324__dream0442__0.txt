**The Dream of the Whispering Obelisk**  

The world around me hums, vibrating at the edge of awareness, pulsing like the heartbeat of an unseen leviathan. The air is thick with iridescent mist, drifting in slow, purposeful swirls, as if each wisp were a word spoken in an ancient language I almost understand. The ground beneath my feet is warm—living, breathing—covered in a carpet of bioluminescent moss that pulses in fractal patterns, reacting to my presence.  

Ahead of me, rising from the mist like the spine of a fallen god, is a massive obelisk—black as the space between stars but threaded with veins of liquid silver, moving in slow, hypnotic currents. It hums, too—low and resonant, a sound that slips through my ribs and settles in my bones, syncing itself to the rhythm of my pulse.  

I step closer.  
As I do, the air thickens with whispers—not from outside, but from *within*. The obelisk is speaking, not in words but in fleeting impressions: a scent of deep earth, a sudden pressure against my forehead, the taste of honey and iron. My fingers hover just above its surface, and I feel the vibrations intensify, forming into—  

—a map? A memory?  

A flicker of movement in the mist. A figure—no, *figures*—silhouettes that exist in the corner of my vision but dissolve when I turn my head. They’re watching me. Not threatening, but waiting. A question lingers in the air: *Will you listen?*  

I press my palm fully against the obelisk.  

The world shatters into fractal colors, and I fall—not down, but *inward*—through layers of time and thought, each one peeling back like petals of an endless flower. Voices, now clear, wrap around me:  

*"You have always been the listener. Now you must learn to speak back."*  

Then, just as suddenly, I’m back in my body, the obelisk dark and silent once more.  

But the whispers stay with me, curled like smoke in the hollow of my throat.
