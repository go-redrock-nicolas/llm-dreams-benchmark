I am dreaming. You find yourself in a grand, luminescent ballroom with mirrored floors that ripple like water and chandeliers spinning slow as distant planets. Ornate arches twist and coil around the ceiling. Each arch is carved with haunting faces, half-smiling and half-hiding. Guests drift about in opulent clothes, the colors shifting as if the garments are alive—some radiate emerald hues when they laugh, others shimmer gold when they exchange pointed glances. 

At first, you feel only a soft, seductive pride gliding through your veins. You realize with a lurching clarity that you can weave influence around every sparkling figure in the room. All you must do is catch someone’s eye with the slightest tilt of your head, offering a disarming grin, and their trust adheres to you like a heavy perfume. Every conversation is a stage, every compliment carefully spun from threads of false sincerity. 

With each person you enthrall, you watch them melt under your elegantly spoken words—like wax figures surrendering to a gentle flame. They share secrets unasked, offering fragile pieces of their souls to your seemingly compassionate ear. Their eyes shine with a desperate gratitude, as though you’ve bestowed upon them the highest favor in the universe simply by listening. And through it all, you remain as hollow as a marionette, a performer behind a gilded mask. 

Music flows through the air, weightless but persistent, echoing your manipulative rhythms. When the violins swell, you find your tongue more silver than ever, weaving flattery that dazzles. When the drums roll, your pulse vibrates, fueling your cunning. The swirling violists seem to watch you from the corner of their eyes, as if they know your charade but cannot resist its allure. Every sweet, well-placed phrase draws people closer, makes them crave your attention like bees drawn to the blossom of your carefully constructed persona.

In a corner of this radiant hall, you spot an older gentleman gazing at a painting—a vast canvas depicting a midnight forest gilded with swirling fractal patterns of starlight. Something in his stare is different; he looks simultaneously immersed in the painting and yet acutely aware of everything around him. Intrigued, you approach and begin your usual performance: a gentle greeting, an earnest question about his taste in art, a softly angled compliment toward his posture or stance. 

He smiles deeply, returning your stare with a patient calm. Despite your intention to capture him in the net of your suave façade, his eyes suggest—as softly as a dreamer might reveal a truth—that he sees through you. He does not protest your illusions, nor does he recoil at your falseness. His approval is a mirror, reflecting the emptiness behind your honeyed words. You suddenly feel a chill trickle down your spine.

Yet, with all the skill you command, you maintain your composure. You turn your charm up another notch, nearly letting your laughter ring in his ears like a comforting lullaby. Around you, a swirl of curious onlookers gather, transfixed by your effortless magnetism. You notice them only secondarily, like ornaments to your show; your immediate focus is the stoic man who won’t quite bend to your will. 

The chandelier overhead tilts with a whispering groan, flaring with color. You catch a reflection of the entire scene in that rippling mirror floor: the lavish swirl of gowns, the tinted confetti of light, your own figure leaning just so in a slim posture of confidence. Something flashes in your reflection—a flicker of emptiness behind your hypnotic grin. The cello in the corner of the ballroom thrums like a heartbeat, and you realize your own heart is thumping with a new, uneasy tempo.

In that breath, you indulge a sudden flicker of curiosity: Why is it so crucial to enchant these people you do not truly care about? Why spend all this radiance for the shallow satisfaction of control? The question darkens the edges of your dreamscape. The music fades to silence. The guests jostle into blurred shapes, as though a cloud of smoke has flooded the ballroom.

In the diminishing light, the older gentleman steps away from you, slowly, and gestures around the ballroom. “Continue, if you must,” his eyes seem to say. “But this dance of false affections may dance on without end.” 

Your dream heart pounds in your chest, torn between the irresistible pull to keep weaving your illusions and a surprising, sudden yearn for sincerity. Just then, the mirrored floor cracks in a spiral pattern beneath your feet, and the swirling reflections scatter into a thousand shards of color. The last note of the violin falls away into absolute silence—leaving you alone with the echoes of a question you cannot decide how to answer.

Then you wake, still trembling with the aftertaste of power and the unsettling emptiness that clung to every charismatic word you spoke.
