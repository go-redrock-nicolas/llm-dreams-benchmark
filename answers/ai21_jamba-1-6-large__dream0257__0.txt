I am dreaming. My field of vision begins as a misty whirlpool, disorienting like the surface of a pond after a misplaced stone, but shifting its shapes as it tries to settle itself into focus. I am standing in a wide courtyard of emerald grass and sandstone pathways, a pool at the center reflecting the melded shades of the twilit sky, and all around me towered cliffs are fortress-like in their sheer expansiveness. Wisps of violet mist hover close to the ground, slowly fading into the shadows here and there as though the night itself has breath. 

But there is something profoundly wrong about this place. It is not merely the strangeness of the cliffs, but a deep unease that permeates the air, a vibration not unlike a message whispered into a string phone that will never reach its endpoint. The whispers clash, and I hear in the wind something like the tone of voices from an ancient, forgotten language that I cannot understand, but can somehow still feel. 

A pale figure stands at the other side of the pool, its form indistinct against the dim light. I cannot tell if they are male or female, but the way they carry themselves, the unearthly grace in their step, and the sharpness of their gaze speak of otherworldly origins. As they speak, their voice reverberates through me as though speaking directly to my bones, and the whispers grow louder. They do not speak in words I recognize, but the emotion within it burns with a fire that could both warm my soul and scorch my dreams. 

The pale figure takes a step forward. Delicate ripples spread from the pool with every motion. It feels as though the world itself shifts uneasily, and the whispers crescendo into a thousand fractured tongues. My mind feels fractured too, split into countless streams of thought—one pulling at me to fight, another struggling to run, yet another whispering that this is not real, none of it, and all the while the air grows heavier around me. 

"You dare stand before me?" they ask, and in an instant, the whispers explode into a shrieking storm, and the cold of the air becomes biting, as if a hundred icy needles prick my skin. I can no longer tell if the figure before me is real or a hallucination of my unease. Their voice cuts through the storm with the rasp of knives on stone, and the pale figure, unearthly in their beauty and horror, continues to beckon me forward. 

I want to scream. I want to run. I want to beg whoever is behind this torment to release me. But my voice catches in my throat, my legs refuse to carry me, and my mind is consumed by a soundless roar that reverberates through everything I know. It is terror that grips me—terror clawing at my chest, my throat, my gut. 

The wind rises higher, louder, stronger, turning into a whirlwind of mist, dust, and light, and with one final scream, the figure begins to dissolve. Their form falters, but in their absence the world seems to fill with their presence, pressing in from all sides with suffocating weight. I can feel the ground trembling now, hear the stone cracking, and the pool before me begins to split, one half collapsing into darkness, the other into light. 

The whispering does not stop, but it grows distant now, almost laughing as I realize I am no longer standing. I am lying on the cracked ground, my hands in the dirt, trembling uncontrollably, knowing somehow that this is the end. 

And then, through the haze, I wake up.
