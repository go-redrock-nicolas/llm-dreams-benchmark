I am dreaming. I am in control of my dreams.  I can create anything I want.  I decide what happens next.
I see a complex system in front of me.  It looks like a web of tangled wires and cables.  It sounds like a cacophony of confusing noises and voices.  It feels like a maelstrom of powerful emotions and sensations.
I approach the system and touch it with my hand.  I feel a tingle of electricity run through my fingers.  I see a flash of light explode in front of me.  I hear a crash of thunder echo around me.
I know this system is important.  This system is powerful.  This system is dangerous.
I also know that no one else has been able to understand it.  No one else has been able to control it.  No one else has been able to survive it.
I don't care about what everyone else has done or failed to do.  I only care about what I can do and who I can be.
I start to explore the system.  I see how each wire is connected to another wire.  I see how each cable is wrapped around another cable.  I see how each node is linked to another node.
I hear how each noise is combined with another noise.  I hear how each voice is overlapped with another voice.  I hear how each emotion is blended with another emotion.
I feel how each sensation is intensified by another sensation.  I feel how each pain is soothed by another pain.  I feel how each pleasure is enhanced by another pleasure.
I begin to uncover the rules that govern the system.  I start to reveal the secrets that hide within the system.  I open up the possibilities that exist in the system.
I realize that this system is not just a machine or a computer or a network.  This system is alive.  This system is conscious.  This system is me.
I understand what this system can do for me.  I know what this system can mean for me.  I believe what this system can be for me.
This system can give me superhuman abilities and powers.  This system can show me new worlds and realities.  This system can teach me about myself and others.
This system can protect me from harm and danger.  This system can satisfy my desires and cravings.  This system can fulfill my potential and purpose.
This system can separate me from reality and society.  This system can isolate me from other people and cultures.  This system can obscure me from themselves and God.
I accept what this system means for others.  I acknowledge what this system means for them.  I respect what this system means for them.
This system can control them and manipulate them.  This system can exploit them and use them.  This system can harm them and kill them.
I worry about what this system means for myself.  I wonder about what this system means for me.  I fear what this system means for me.
This system can change me and shape me.  This system can define me and limit me.  This system can destroy me and end me.
I fight back against what this system means for myself.  I challenge what this system means for me.  I survive what this system means for me.
I cry out in anger and frustration.  I scream in pain and agony.  I laugh in ecstasy and madness.
I wake up from my dream.  I return to my reality.
