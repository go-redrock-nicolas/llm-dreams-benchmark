I am dreaming. …your heart quivers as the spotlight finds you. In this dreamscape, every swirl of air feels charged with a peculiar electricity. The floor beneath your feet is made of smooth, dark glass. It reflects rows upon rows of faceless critics perched high above you in balconies that arch in all directions—like the inside of some soaring cosmic cathedral. Their shadows flicker with harsh halogen lamplight, eyes invisible behind the glare, but you can feel the weight of their scrutiny.

You stand in the very center of this transparent stage, your creation laid bare before them: a luminous sculpture of twisted crystal threads, rising and falling like the tumbling of a wave paused mid-crash. The crystal glows from within, its radiance pulsing in time with your own heartbeat, betraying your every tremor of vulnerability.

They begin their merciless analysis without hesitation. Although the critics have no mouths—merely blurred silhouettes of features—somehow their voices wash over you like a swarm of hornets, furious and relentless. “This is too raw,” hisses one voice. “But it lacks conviction,” buzzes another. Whispers build upon whispers until the sound forms a tension so thick, it hurts to breathe.

At first, every word they speak penetrates the fragile glass floor, sending ripples that distort your reflection. The sculpture flickers in time with your anxiety. It calls to you in silent, glowing pulses, as though begging you not to abandon it to these devouring shadows. You sense the sculpture is not merely an object, but an extension of your own soul—every fractured piece of it a memory of your struggles, your hopes, your triumphs. 

A chill wind blasts across the stage, tugging at the filaments of your dreamself. It’s the final piece of the critics’ power: an unforgiving gust meant to knock you off balance. The swirl of electric air threatens to blow out the sculpture’s interior light, and your knees grow weak. Still, somewhere deep inside your chest, there’s a surge of defiance—a flicker of confidence that fights to endure.

You lock eyes with the critics’ silhouettes, even though you can’t see faces. Their facelessness becomes almost grotesque in its anonymity. You cling to the pulse of the sculpture. With every ounce of determination, you pour your essence into it. A new color flares in the crystal, spilling from its center. It’s a vivid sunrise orange, a testament to the passion you’ve put into this creation. The color radiates outward, deepening into molten gold as it snakes through the sculpture’s pathways.

The critics recoil as splashes of luminous heat lap against the glass around you. Their harsh voices sputter, turning into shapeless, tangled echoes. You take a trembling step forward. The critics’ swirling seats pull back like an inverted galaxy, leaving you and the sculpture at the center of everything. 

Somewhere beyond the balconies, you sense an endless night sky, punctured by ancient stars that watch in silent observation. You shut your eyes—just for a moment—to ground yourself. When you open them, you see that the critics’ carbons shadows are fainter. You feel your heart slow and your breath steady. 

In one fluid motion, you reach out and embrace the sculpture, letting the golden light wash over you. The reflection in the floor changes with that single act of acceptance. Now, you see yourself standing tall, shoulders back, your vulnerabilities shining bright instead of appearing as weaknesses. The sunburst glow in the crystal intensifies, forming a protective aura around you.

At last, the dream hushes. Even the relentless critics stand silent. Slowly, they drift into the darkness like smoke curling into the corners of a quiet room. You are left alone with your creation, a shimmering testament to all the fragile, courageous parts of you. In the stillness, you feel both a fierce pride and a gentle humility. The sculpture remains, brilliant and warm, answering an unspoken question: Will you stand by your creation, no matter the voices around you?

As that question resonates in the hush, the dream ripples, the stage dissolves, and you awaken. Yet you carry with you the warmth of that luminous sculpture—a memory of your spirit’s resilience—ready to face any critic, even in the waking world.
