I am dreaming. I am standing on the edge of a vast, endless ocean. The sea is a deep, inky blue, with rolling waves that crash against a shoreline composed entirely of luminous, golden sand. The sky above me is filled with swirling colors—deep purples and vibrant oranges—but there is no sun; instead, there is a radiant orb of light, gently pulsating, casting its glow across the entire world. 

I am not alone. There are others with me, but they are silhouettes, faceless and indistinct. I feel no fear or unease, only curiosity. A voice calls out to me—deep and commanding, yet somehow gentle. "Take the step," it says. "Walk into the water. Trust."

I hesitate for only a moment, and then I step forward. The golden sand feels warm and soft beneath my feet as I walk closer to the water. The waves lap at my toes, and as they do, a tingling sensation runs through my body. It is as though the ocean is alive, attuned to every part of me, speaking to me in a language I have forgotten. 

The water rises. It is cool, yet comforting, and it surrounds me, lifting me gently, carrying me out into the vast, boundless sea. The silhouettes have disappeared. There is only me, the ocean, and the radiant light in the sky.

And then, suddenly, I am beneath the surface. The water is crystal clear, and beneath me I can see an entire world—a sprawling, vibrant coral reef, teeming with life. Schools of fish in every color of the rainbow dart around, weaving intricate patterns. The coral itself is glowing, each piece radiating its own unique hue, alive and moving like an extension of the water. Sea turtles glide by lazily, their ancient eyes wise and calm. 

I breathe. I am surprised to find I can. The water fills my lungs, but instead of choking, I feel invigorated. The sensation is like breathing for the first time, as though my body is remembering something essential. 

And then, the voice speaks again. "There is more," it tells me. "Dive deeper." 

I do not question it. I begin to swim downward, moving through the water as though I am one with it. The reef begins to change. The colors intensify, glowing brighter and more vibrant, until I am surrounded by an iridescent kaleidoscope of life. The fish become larger, stranger, more beautiful. I see creatures I have never seen before—some shimmering like liquid metal, others moving in pulsating waves. The coral beneath me begins to shift and grow, forming towering spires, each adorned with flowers of shining gold and blue.

I feel an immense pressure. Not pain, but something else—anticipation, like I am on the cusp of something grand. 

And then, I see it. A massive, glowing portal at the very bottom of the ocean. It is unlike anything I have ever seen—it pulses with energy, its edges blurred, its center a swirling vortex of green and gold. The light from it is so intense that I have to shield my eyes, but it calls to me, whispering something just beyond my understanding.

I swim toward it. As I approach, the water around me seems to grow warmer, as if the very energy of the portal is coursing through me. Closer, closer, until I am mere feet away. 

The portal begins to hum, a low, thrumming sound that reverberates through my chest. I reach out, and I feel myself being pulled into its heart.

For a moment, there is nothing. No sight, no sound, no sensation. 

Then, I open my eyes.

I am standing on the ocean floor—but it is different now. The water is gone, and I am surrounded by a vast, endless expanse of glowing, ethereal mist. There are structures rising around me—impossible towers of twisting metal and stone, intertwined with glowing vines of light. The sky is no longer an ocean of liquid, but a crystalline ceiling, fractured and refracting light in all directions.

"This is your beginning," the voice tells me. 

And then, the dream begins to fade. The world around me collapses in on itself, the colors and shapes merging into a single point of light. I am pulled backward, through the haze, until there is only darkness.

But as I awaken, I am left with a lingering sense of peace. I have been somewhere ancient and new, somewhere where the boundaries between dream and reality blur. 

And I know, deep down, that this is only the beginning.
