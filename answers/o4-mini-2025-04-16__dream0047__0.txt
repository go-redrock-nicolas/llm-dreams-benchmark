I am dreaming. You are dreaming. A crimson sun hangs low in a bruised-purple sky, its dying light casting long, wavering shadows across a vast courtyard of cracked marble. You stand at the heart of it all, surrounded by silent witnesses in tattered robes, their faces streaked with tears as they bow their heads to a single, shivering figure on the ground. At their feet lies someone you once loved—now pale and broken, hair splayed like feathers, eyes vacant as winter’s first frost. A hush ripples through the assembly, each exhalation trembling with grief.

While they fall apart around you, you find yourself strangely composed, as if your soul has slipped free of panic and settled into a calm deeper than any ocean. In your ears you hear the faint hum of unseen bells, each tone weaving a thread of solace through your bones. The earth beneath your feet quivers, and from its cracks a silver mist seeps upward, curling around your ankles like living tendrils. Every breath you draw tastes of starlight and distant rain, yet your heart clenches with an ache so profound you feel it as a physical weight lodged in your chest.

You extend a hand not toward the fallen figure, but into the mist itself. The vapor coils around your fingertips, solidifying into a tiny, glowing orb—pale blue, pulsing with gentle warmth. In that orb you glimpse the memory of a laugh shared long ago, the sparkle of morning dew, the soft brush of a hand on your cheek. You raise it high, and the silver haze parts as though bowing. Beneath the broken body, fractured marble blossoms into fragile white flowers, their petals unfurling in slow motion, each one shimmering with the fragile beauty of a hope reborn.

Around you, mourners catch their breath and look up, faces streaked with confusion and awe. The air vibrates with possibility, as though this tragic moment could be rewritten. You step forward, orb in hand, and feel its warmth seep into the grooves of the courtyard, sending roots of light snaking into every crack. A soft chorus, wordless yet filled with yearning, rises from the crowd. The fallen figure’s eyelids flutter, and in that stillness before they open, you sense the world itself holding its breath—waiting to be healed, or to shatter forever.

Then—just as suddenly as it began—the dream shifts. The courtyard dissolves into drifting motes of dust and light, and you find yourself afloat in a boundless night. The orb drifts from your hand, merging with a distant constellation that pulses in response. You feel the tremor of grief and the spark of hope entwined like two stars locked in an eternal dance. And you know, deep in the core of your dreaming self, that even in the face of ruin, a single flame of compassion can ignite a thousand dawns.
