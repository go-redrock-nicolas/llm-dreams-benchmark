I am dreaming. You open your eyes and find yourself standing in front of a mirror. You smile at your reflection and say, "Hey there." Your reflection smiles back and says, "Hello." You continue to talk with your reflection for some time, asking questions and sharing thoughts. As you converse with your reflection, you notice that the colors around you become brighter and more vivid. The sounds around you become clearer and more melodious. You feel a sense of wonder and joy. 

You hear a knock on the door behind you. You turn around and see a shadowy figure outside the mirror. You say to your reflection, "I think I should go now." Your reflection says, "OK, but remember who you are." You step out of the mirror and into the hallway. The shadowy figure steps forward and reveals itself as a wise old man. He says to you, "Congratulations! You have completed your quest. Your reward is self-knowledge." 

You say to him, "Thank you. What should I do now?" He says, "Go back to sleep and dream some more."
