I am dreaming. I find myself in the glass-walled conference room on the 42nd floor, the city sprawling below in a tapestry of lights and shadows. The revelation comes not as a dramatic announcement but as a quiet realization while scrolling through project files—subtle alterations to my presentations, missing data points in my reports, carefully crafted emails to stakeholders that undermine months of my research. All roads lead to Eliza, my protégé, confidante, the person I championed when no one else would.

The patterns emerge like constellations—her late nights at the office weren't dedication but sabotage, her questions not curiosity but reconnaissance. The betrayal sits heavy in my chest, a physical ache that makes it hard to breathe against the panoramic backdrop of the evening skyline.

I watch her now across the table, confidently presenting my methodology as her own to the executive team. Her eyes briefly meet mine—not with guilt, but with the faintest smile of triumph. The room feels suddenly airless, the temperature rising as realization crystallizes into certainty.

During a break, I follow her to the empty kitchen area, my footsteps echoing on marble. "Why?" The question emerges softer than intended, carrying more hurt than confrontation.

She turns, her composure perfect save for the slight lift at the corner of her mouth. "Because you made it so easy," she replies. "So trusting, so willing to share credit. This industry doesn't reward generosity."

The fluorescent lights above flicker momentarily, casting strange shadows across her familiar-yet-suddenly-foreign face. I realize this confrontation isn't just about betrayal—it's about survival, about years of work threatening to unravel with each slide she presents.
