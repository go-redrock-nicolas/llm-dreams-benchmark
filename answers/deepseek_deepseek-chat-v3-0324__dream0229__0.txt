I am dreaming. I step forward into a gleaming white city of softly rounded buildings that seem to hum with quiet energy, pulsing like a living organism. The air tastes of honey and ozone, scented with something unnatural yet comforting—like synthetic lavender. Towering holographic trees, their leaves flickering between gold and translucent blue, sway in a wind that doesn't exist. People move through the streets, their faces smooth and open, their every movement effortless, as if gravity itself has been gentled for them.  

A woman with silver-irised eyes approaches, her smile so warm it aches. "Welcome," she says, voice resonant like wind chimes. "Here, pain is only a rumor. Suffering is a relic." She gestures toward a mirror-polished archway where light dances in liquid patterns. "Come. You can stop fighting now."  

As I move closer, I notice the others—those perfectly content citizens—have tiny implants behind their ears, pulsing in sync with the city's rhythm. Behind them, in glass-walled alcoves, still figures lie submerged in rose-colored liquid, their faces twitching with rapid-eye movements. "Voluntary dreaming," the woman explains. "Why endure reality when you can curate joy?"  

Then I see it—the shadows at the edges. A flicker of something dark darting between buildings, a child’s ragged doll abandoned in an alley, its stitching splitting like a silent scream. The woman’s smile never wavers as she presses a cool, pearlescent chip into my palm. "No more loneliness," she whispers. "No more fear. Just peace."  

But the doll’s glass eyes gleam wet in the false sunlight, and suddenly I know—the absence of suffering has a weight. A hunger. And the city’s hum isn’t a song.  

It’s feeding.
