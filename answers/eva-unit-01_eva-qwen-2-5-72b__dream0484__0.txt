I am dreaming. A vivid landscape unfolds before me. A serene valley, lush with vibrant green foliage, cradled by towering mountains draped in glaciers that glisten under the golden sun.

As I stand there, taking in the majestic beauty of the scene, I suddenly realize I am floating effortlessly a few feet above the ground. Glancing down, I notice that my body has become translucent, like shimmering stardust gathered into a human form.

A melodious voice echoes, not in my ears, but deep within my being. "Look beyond your self-imposed boundaries," it says, emanating wisdom and strength. The voice propels me forward as I glide above the ground, soaring higher and higher into the sapphire sky.

As I climb, I notice the colors of the landscape below begin to blend and swirl together, transforming into a swirling vortex of kaleidoscopic hues. As I spiral through the cosmic dance of colors, I feel lighter, more expansive, my consciousness expanding beyond the confines of my shimmering body.

Suddenly, I find myself engulfed in an infinite expanse of white light. In this space, a sense of profound peace and oneness permeates my entire being. Time becomes irrelevant, and I lose myself in the serenity of the moment.

Then, the voice emerges once more, bringing forth clarity. "The story you've held so close, the belief that has defined your path... It is a tale of your own making, a construct that need not limit you any longer."

I feel a surge of realization flow through me. This belief, this narrative that I've carried, thinking it to be fixed and immutable, now feels malleable and ephemeral.

I sense a choice before me, a decision that will shape the course of my journey: Will I continue to adhere to this belief, or am I ready to embrace the limitless possibilities that await me?

As I contemplate this decision, I feel a gentle breeze kiss my shimmering form, carrying me higher into the Infinite Light. I am both anchored in the moment and propelled by the promise of what is to come.

I am dreaming.  And in this dream, I am forging a new path, unrestrained by the limiting beliefs that have shaped my past. 

I am dreaming.
