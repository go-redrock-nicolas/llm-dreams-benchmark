I am dreaming. As I stand upon the quarterdeck, the salty spray stings my face and whips my hair into a frenzy. The ship groaned and creaked beneath me, its timbers straining against the ferocious waves that crashed over the bow. Clouds roiled across the night sky, obscuring the moon and stars, casting the world in an eerie, flickering gloom.

My loyal crew scampered about the decks, securing lines and battens, their faces etched with determination and fear. They looked to me, their captain, for guidance and comfort in this nightmarish tempest. I could see the doubt in their eyes, the question of whether I could lead them safely through this storm.

High above, the sails ripped and flapped like giant bats, threatening to tear free at any moment. The mainsail had already been reduced to tatters, hanging in shreds from the yards. I yelled to my first mate over the howling gale, but the words were torn away before they reached him.

A massive wave rolled towards us, taller than anything I had ever seen. It reared up like a living beast, poised to devour our tiny ship whole. I could do nothing but watch in horrified fascination as it crashed down on the deck, smashing through the railing and tossing men like rag dolls.

I was knocked to the deck, the breath driven from my lungs by the force of the water. For a long moment, I couldn't tell which way was up or down, trapped beneath the roiling sea. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the pressure eased, and I kicked my way up to the surface.

Gasping and sputtering, I pulled myself back to my feet, looking around in shock and dismay at the wreckage of my ship. The mainmast had snapped like a matchstick, and the deck was half-flooded, flotsam and jibs of sail everywhere. 

Would we survive the night? 

The storm had the upper hand, and I felt an overwhelming sense of helplessness wash over me. I could only pray that providence would take pity on us in our dire straits, for in my heart I knew we were doomed without a miracle.

But still, I would keep fighting. 

For my crew needed me, and I would not let them perish on my watch. Gathering my wits, I turned to survey the damage anew, determined to keep my ship afloat for as long as I could, to die with my boots on while facing the maw of the beast who sought to claim us for itself. 

Would I survive this test? 

Only the undulating, unfathomable depths knew for sure.
