I am dreaming. At first, time is a sluggish river, thick as honey, oozing past with unbearable reluctance. I am sitting motionless in an endless field of silver grass that ripples like liquid metal under a twilight sky. Each blade hums faintly with a metallic resonance, bending not in the wind—because there is no wind—but in response to the slow, breathing pulse of the earth beneath me. Seconds stretch into hours; I count my heartbeats like a prisoner marking days on a cell wall. Each thud is a gong echoing through my bones, and the space between them yawns into eternity. I feel ancient, fossilized, as though I’ve been here since the dawn of time, waiting for something that may never come.  

Then—a shift.  

A flicker of movement in the distance. A figure? A shadow? My focus narrows, and suddenly time shatters like glass. The world accelerates violently, the grass whipping into a furious storm of glinting filaments as I surge forward. Every step I take fractures the landscape, sending cracks radiating through the ground, revealing glowing veins of molten light beneath. The sky tears open, spinning constellations into chaotic new shapes as my pursuit becomes frantic, desperate. Milliseconds stretch into lifetimes—I feel the rush of centuries in a single breath, civilizations rising and falling in the periphery of my vision. The figure I chase is always just out of reach, slipping through time like a fish through water, leaving trails of shimmering afterimages that hum with an eerie, forgotten song.  

Then I stumble.  

The world *hiccups*.  

Time freezes again—but differently. Now, I am suspended in a single instant, a butterfly pinned in amber. The grass stops mid-sway. The sky halts its unraveling. Even the light seems to coagulate in the air, thick and syrupy. I realize, with a dizzying thrill, that this is the space *between* moments—the infinite, fractal microcosm hidden inside a blink. Here, I can see the threads of possibility quivering like spider silk, each one a divergent path, a different future. I reach out to touch one—  

—and then the dream *snaps* like a rubber band.  

I am back in the field, standing empty-handed. The figure is gone. The sky is whole. But the air thrums with the echo of my brief trespass into timelessness.  

And I wake, heart pounding, still tasting eternity on my tongue.
