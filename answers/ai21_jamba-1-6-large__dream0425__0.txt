I am dreaming. In my dream, I am standing on the edge of a vast, amber-hued canyon. The air is thick with a sweet, earthy scent, and a rhythmic, almost visceral, sound resonates through the canyon wallsâ€”a gentle, primordial drumming. The wind whispers ancient secrets as it brushes my skin, carrying specks of golden dust that shimmer in the sunlight.

Below me, the canyon is alive with a glowing river, its surface shimmering with iridescent hues. It winds like a serpentine ribbon, carving paths of promise and mystery into the rugged terrain. I feel a compulsion to descend, to immerse myself in its flow, though the pull fills me with both awe and apprehension.

Suddenly, small yet luminous beings, radiant with an inner fire, emerge from hidden crevices in the canyon walls. Their movements are fluid yet fragmented, as if their very essence flickers between dimensions. They whisper, too faint to comprehend, yet urgent in their persistence.
