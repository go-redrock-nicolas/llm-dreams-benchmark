I am dreaming.

The night is vast and deep, an endless ocean of stars, crescent moons, and planets. The air is crisp and cold, with a smoky haze hanging in the air, as if I am standing on a high cliff somewhere in the Rockies under a full moon. I can see my breath as it freezes mid-air, turning into shimmering diamonds.

I hear a low and haunting howl, and my heart skips a beat. The sound comes from every direction yet never directly behind me, like it is alive. The chill in my bones isn't just from the bitter cold; it's an electric anticipation that prickles in every inch of my skin.

Suddenly, the clouds part, revealing a shimmering aurora borealis overhead. The swirling hues—emerald greens, sapphire blues, ruby reds—dance and shimmer, but instead of flowing above me, they seem to swoop down, enveloping me like a living, breathing cape. The northern lights feel warm and alive, a symphony of whispers and crackles, like the Northern lights have come alive, moving, breathing.

In the distance, I see an impressive mountain range, vast and towering, the peaks glowing white against a sky still lit with leftover twilight. As I approach, I realize that the mountains are not made of stone or ice but of books. Books of every kind, shape, and size—ancient texts, modern novels, worn diaries, and even crumpled magazines. The books form sheer walls of knowledge, an endless library stretching as far as I can see.

I take a step towards the immense, imposing mountain, letting my fingers trail over the titles, soaking up the feel of the bindings, the worn corners, the crisp edge of pages. I breathe in the faint but undeniable scent of ink and paper, and I am overwhelmed with a sense of possibility, power, and the wonder of unlimited knowledge.

With every step, the mountain becomes less intimidating and more inviting. The books whisper faintly as I approach, and suddenly, they begin to sway and part, forming a narrow, lit path. The trees around me begin to whisper as though they too are alive, bending in to point me along my way.

I hear faint voices calling out in a distant symphony of ages, stories rising in the air like a fog, wrapping me gently in soft currents. These are the voices of those who have walked these paths before me—authors, philosophers, adventurers whose words and deeds have become legend.

And then, suddenly, I come to a clearing. In the center stands a massive, ancient tree, its trunk too wide to be measured. Its roots are imbedded deep into the earth, reaching towards the sky as if growing into infinity.

The tree is covered with countless faces, carved into its ancient bark. They are the faces of people who have passed on, carved into the fabric of the universe itself. I hear the faint murmurs of their memories, mingling with the hum of the cosmos.

I reach out, and my hand meets the bark. The tree, alive with history, gives under my touch. I push into the bark, and I step through into the void beyond.

I emerge in a different world.

I’m standing on the edge of an endless, luminous ocean. Waves crash in slow motion, glowing with a radiant, pulsating light that comes from within them. The sand beneath my feet is warm and alive, shimmering with grains that seem to dance with invisible fireflies.

Before me, a futuristic city rises from the ocean, its buildings made of glass and steel shimmering with a golden hue. The buildings are alive, with flickering lights that look like stars floating in and out of existence. I realize I’ve stepped inside the far-off future, where humanity has risen to the heavens—and then fallen back, this time to live amongst the waves.

I walk through the city, my feet never touching the ground but somehow still feeling the soft cushion of light vibrating beneath my feet. The buildings tower high and low, their glass walls alive with images, holograms that shift and change, unfolding stories into an ever-evolving reality.

I feel the pull, a solemn whisper, from deep below the ocean. I descend deep, plunging into an undersea world, an ancient, abandoned space that breathes with the ocean’s pulse. I see the ruins of cities long lost to time, their weathered, tumbled walls overgrown with seaweed and coral. Here and there, the beautiful spectra of bioluminescent fish shimmer, illuminating the depths in flickering, neon colors.

I feel the weight of history pressing on me, and the ancient stories of forgotten civilizations surface in my thoughts. I swim deeper, where the sun no longer reaches, the light of the deep ocean now guiding me. It becomes brighter, otherworldly, almost like smoke.

There, I see it—an immense, luminous jellyfish suspended in the dark. The jellyfish’s body is a luminous cathedral, a radiant orb of light that glows with the purest energy I’ve ever seen. It is alive, its surface pulsating with alien hums and shimmering lights, its voice singing sweetly to me. It beckons me closer.

I reach out, but the jellyfish draws away, pulling me into its center, into a realm deeper, brighter. I feel something shift within me, and everything around me begins to spin, the colors careening together, swirling into a vortex.

When I emerge, I am in another place, another time, and I realize I am no longer myself. I have become something else, a being of light and energy, pure and unbound. I soar through the galaxy, a shimmering entity fueled by cosmic winds.

This is the dream. It is beautiful and terrifying, mystical and deeply real. It is the kind of dream that stays with you, stirring long after you wake, a rich and vivid tapestry of worlds only imagined.

But then, the alarm rings, soft and persistent, pulling you back into the waking world. You open your eyes, but as you do, you feel the lingering pull of the dream, the vivid worlds, the sea of stars, and the ancient tree. You can’t help but wonder, Just how much of that was real?
