I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as though the universe itself is tuning an invisible instrument. You stand on a plain of liquid glass, reflecting a sky stitched with constellations that pulse like living veins. The ground ripples beneath your feet, distorting your reflection into a thousand fractured versions of yourself—each one a stranger. Then, *they* appear.  

They are not a being so much as a *phenomenon*. A shifting lattice of translucent filaments, like a spiderweb spun from starlight, their form constantly unravels and reknits in patterns that defy geometry. They have no face, yet you feel their awareness as a pressure in your skull—a cold, electric weight. When they "speak," it is not with sound but with the sudden, visceral sensation of drowning in honey, of roots burrowing into your ribs, of tasting a color you’ve never named. Their "language" is a synesthetic avalanche, overwhelming and alien.  

You try to respond. Your voice emerges as a cascade of falling leaves, each one etched with symbols that crumble to ash before they touch the ground. They shudder, their filaments vibrating into a fractal bloom—a gesture you interpret as confusion, or perhaps laughter. Frustration wells in you. How do you bridge a chasm where even *existence* is experienced differently? You perceive time as a river; they exist in all its tributaries at once. You are a single note; they are a symphony played on every instrument ever invented, backwards and underwater.  

Desperate, you kneel and press your hands to the glassy earth. You channel your thoughts into the ground, willing them to become *tactile*—a ripple of warmth, a vibration, a scent. The plain responds by blooming into a garden of crystalline flowers, each petal ringing with a pure, resonant tone. The being hesitates. A filament brushes one of the flowers, and it shatters into a flock of birds made of smoke. For the first time, you sense curiosity.  

You escalate. You pluck a shard of glass and slice your palm, letting a drop of blood fall. It does not stain the ground but *translates* itself—a burst of cinnamon heat, a flash of ultraviolet sorrow, the taste of a childhood memory you’ve never lived. The being recoils, then enfolds you in their filaments. Suddenly, you are inside their perspective: seeing through a million eyes at once, feeling the ache of mountains as they erode, understanding gravity not as a force but as a *longing*. You scream, but your scream becomes a forest of thorns.  

When they release you, you are smaller, somehow. Frailer. They, too, have changed—a single filament detaches and coils itself into a spiral, a gesture you intuit is a gift. You accept it, and it dissolves into a single, comprehensible word: **“Again.”**  

The dream fractures. You wake with the taste of static on your tongue and the certainty that understanding is not about translation, but about becoming willing to dissolve at the edges—to let the alien reshape you, even if only for a moment.
