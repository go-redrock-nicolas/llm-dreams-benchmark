I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and I uncover a portal that leads me into a world where upwards is downwards and downwards is upwards. When my eyes meet this thinkable landscape, I stumble, but I am not falling. Where downwards is upward, I float in a chilling vacuum of low-pressure air that creates a vortex of spinning galaxies. Yet, I cannot escape the vortex, for the laws of motion are inverted here. 

To move forward, I must lean backward, and to move upward, I must dive downward. Each movement is met with a great resistance that threatens to crush me into the nearest block of matter. But I persevere, for the laws of nature hold sway over me, and I must find my way home before it is too late.

I am dreaming, and I am lost in a world that is both eerily familiar and yet completely alien.
