I am dreaming. I'm standing in a lush, iron-wrought café, its walls adorned with glittering crystals that refract sunlight into a thousand tiny rainbows. The air is alive with the sweet scent of freshly baked croissants, and the soft hum of conversation lingers in the air. I'm sipping a rich, dark coffee, feeling the warmth spread through my veins as I watch the world go by through the large, bay window.

As I gaze out into the street, my eyes land on a small, struggling artist, huddled on a bench, clutching a worn canvas and a set of paints. Her eyes are sunken, her skin pale, and her hair disheveled. I watch as she smudges a vibrant splash of color onto the canvas, her tears mingling with the paint as she gazes up at me with a mixture of desperation and longing.

Without thinking, I make my move. I slip out of the café and approach the artist, my mind clouded by an overpowering sense of pity and benevolence. She looks up, startled, as I gently take her canvas from her trembling hands.

"You must let me buy this from you," I whisper, my fingers closing around the canvas with an air of urgency. "I want to own it. I want to display it in a gallery, to bring it to the world's attention. You deserve to be celebrated, to be recognized for your talent."

To my surprise, the artist hesitates, eyes darting around the crowded street as if searching for an escape. "It's not for sale," she says finally, her voice barely audible over the din of the café.

But I'm not listening. I'm reframing the situation in my mind, conjuring justifications and excuses to justify taking the canvas from her. "This is a business transaction," I tell her firmly. "Think of it as an investment in your future. I'm doing you a favor, really. I can present it to galleries, collectors, the critics. I can make your art famous."

As I speak, the artist's expression falters from resistance to acceptance, her shoulders sagging in defeat. I feel a surge of relief, as if I've rescued her from some unseen oppression. I surrender my internal censor, ignoring the tiny voice that whispers "this isn't right".

"We can discuss details," I continue, producing a checkbook and pen from my pocket. "Let's make this a partnership. We'll split the profits, equal shares. You'll benefit from this as much as I do."

The artist's gaze lingers on the canvas, her hand hovering over mine as if considering the proposal. For a moment, I feel a bizarre sense of pride, a thrill of accomplishment. I'm doing what's best for her, after all. And besides, it's just business.

As I sign the check, made out for a figure astronomical for the struggling artist, the café around us begins to blur, fading into a world of gray stone and steely calculation. The coffee shop becomes a sterile boardroom, the artist's eyes turning to calculating scales, plumbing the depths of a fixed stare, and I find myself congratulating myself for making the 'necessary' choice.
