I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the static of a thousand half-formed thoughts. You stand in a library that stretches infinitely in all directions, its shelves carved from bone-white marble and stacked with books bound in moth-wing leather. Each volume pulses faintly, as though breathing. You realize, with a shiver of unease, that every book contains a life—not yours, but lives you’ve invented, entire universes spun from your compulsive fictions. The titles shift as you glance at them: *The Girl Who Married a Clockwork Sparrow. The Man Who Sold His Shadow to a Nun. The City Beneath the Ice That Sang in Binary.* You open one. The pages writhe with ink that hasn’t dried, sentences rewriting themselves mid-sentence. A voice whispers in your ear, *“You’ve never told the truth here.”*  

You turn to defend yourself, but your mouth moves before you can think. “I once lived in a house made of frozen tears,” you say aloud, surprised by the conviction in your voice. “My mother was a moth who burned her wings to keep us warm.” The words spill out, effortless, and as they do, the library shudders. A new book slams into existence on a nearby shelf, its cover gleaming with the exact shade of blue as the sparrow’s feathers from your lie. You feel a thrill—sickening, addictive—as if you’ve just inhaled starlight.  

You keep talking.  

“I sailed across a desert on a raft woven from my sister’s hair. We fed the sand lizards sonnets, and they grew large enough to ride.” Another book appears. Then another. The shelves twist, creaking like living things, corridors sprouting like cancerous vines to accommodate your growing mythos. You glimpse figures in the distance—readers, perhaps, or the ghosts of your own inventions—leaning over balustrades to listen. Their faces are blurred, featureless save for the glint of teeth where eyes should be.  

But the lies begin to unravel.  

A child emerges from the shadows, clutching a book titled *The Boy Who Lied to the Moon*. Its pages flutter open, and you see yourself inside—a smaller, truer version—kneeling in a field, confessing a harmless fib to a silver crescent in the sky. The memory is real, and it burns. You slam the book shut, but the child doesn’t vanish. It tilts its head, and its teeth grin wider.  

“They’ll come soon,” it says, voice like wind through a graveyard. “The ones who hunger for your stories. But what happens when your lies taste *too sweet*?”  

The library darkens. The books scream.  

You run, your footsteps echoing in rhythms that don’t match your strides. Staircases spiral upside-down; doors open to reveal deserts, oceans, rooms filled with clocks all ticking backward. You stumble into a hall of mirrors, each reflection showing a different version of yourself: a pirate with a compass for a heart, a widow draped in crows, a god who forgot their own name. You claw at the glass, desperate to shatter the fictions, but your hands pass through them like smoke.  

Behind you, the teeth-click laughter grows louder.  

You spin around. The figures from the shelves have drawn closer. Their mouths hang open, jaws unhinged like snakes, swallowing the air—and your lies—greedily. One reaches out, its fingers dissolving into smoke, and plucks a book from a high shelf: *The Life You’re Living Now*. It devours the volume in one bite, paper and ink and all, and its eyes fix on you with sudden, terrifying clarity.  

“You’re running out of stories,” it hisses.  

Panic floods your veins. You open your mouth to lie again, but nothing comes. Your mind is a blank page. The creatures surge forward, their hunger palpable, and the library collapses around you—a avalanche of forgotten fables. You fall through the void, clutching at threads of half-truths, until—  

You wake up.  

But on your nightstand, glowing faintly in the dark, is a book you don’t remember writing. Its title glows in blood-red ink: *The Dreamer Who Fed Their Own Soul to the Shadows*.  

You open it.  

The first page is blank.  

The second page has your name.  

The third is already turning.
