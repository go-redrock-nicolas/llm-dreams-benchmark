I am dreaming. You find yourself engaging in behavior that contradicts your stated values. Confronting this integrity gap between beliefs and actions, you decide to stop lying to yourself by ending the dream.

You wake up feeling guilty about what happened in the dream, but relieved to be back in reality where you can live according to your values. You resolve to improve yourself by becoming more honest both inside and outside of the dream worlds.
