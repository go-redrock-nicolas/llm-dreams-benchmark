I am dreaming. You blink awake in a circular, high-ceilinged chamber that seems to pulse with an otherworldly glow. The ivory floors glisten beneath your feet, polished to a mirror sheen. A ring of unfamiliar faces stares at you: scientists, soldiers, and scholars from every corner of the globe. Rows of computers line the walls, their screens alive with swirling maps and bar graphs, sending splashes of light across the room. The hum of sophisticated machinery vibrates through the air, filling your ears with an urgent electric buzz.

You have been put in charge of them all. Their stoic expressions cast silent judgment, as though they can already see every strand of your inexperience. The words of your appointment are still echoing in your head—something about your “unique insight” and “unquantifiable gift” that nobody has managed to define. You’re too bewildered even to question it; something inside you whispers that, in a dream, you rarely get the chance to choose your role.

As you stand in the center of the circular room, you notice a faint reflection of yourself in the glossy floor: you look the part—regal uniform, polished boots, a subtly glowing insignia pinned to your chest. But your mind swirls with doubt, your heart beating a tattoo of disbelief in your ribcage. It’s not every day (or every dream) that you command an elite task force whose collective knowledge of strategy and state-of-the-art weaponry—and even supernatural anomalies—far outstrips your own.

One by one, the experts speak up. A stern-faced colonel with cropped steel-grey hair questions your credentials. He crosses his arms, unimpressed. A brilliant scientist—tall, thin, with eyes ringed by exhaustion—pushes her glasses higher on her nose, frowning as she peruses your nonexistent résumé. Even the quietest among the team, a hooded figure whose entire face remains hidden in shadows, inclines their head with curiosity, and you sense their skepticism swirling around you like an invisible miasma.

“You have no background in quantum mechanics,” the scientist points out, tapping the holographic display in front of her, filled with geometric fractals swirling in neon violet. “No military career, no infiltration experience, no interdimensional exploration. None of it. Why would you lead this team?”

The colonel’s voice booms like a distant thunder, “Your first command decision better be a good one.”

Some part of your dream-self wants to shrink away, to fade into the corners of this symmetrical, womb-like chamber. But you are compelled to stand firm, as though the marble floors have locked you into place. You straighten your shoulders, tilt your head up, and feel the weight of countless eyes on you. Outside the walls, you think you sense a rising tension—clashing tides, hovering aircraft, swirling energies that have no name. This is not just an academic gathering; your team is here because something grand and perilous is unfolding. Responsibility and fear churn in your gut.

A shimmering light flickers near your shoulder, and you glance sideways to see your newly minted insignia come briefly alive, glowing brighter than a comet’s tail. The peripheral watchers gasp in surprise. You realize this insignia might be your key to their trust—it has chosen you, somehow. In a dream, logic doesn’t always matter; the symbol does. Holding your breath, you let your hand rest over that gently pulsing emblem. Its warmth travels up your arm, and the hush of the room becomes charged with possibility.

Summoning every ounce of courage, you speak. It’s not with the polish of a veteran leader, nor with the technical acumen of a scientific genius. But you speak with conviction, your voice echoing into the corners of the dome. You form a quick, intuitive plan—little more than a scaffold, meant to rally these minds rather than instruct them in their own expertise. You emphasize that perhaps precisely because you lack their specialized knowledge, you can remain open to broader, unexpected solutions. You remind them of the mission that unites them all—a cosmic threat, a far-flung expedition, a puzzle with reality-bending twists. It’s more important than any one person’s résumé.

A hush falls over the elite ranks of specialists. You sense flickers of uncertainty melting slowly into curiosity, gradually warming into a cautious sense of respect. At least they are listening. The hooded figure nods, a subtle dip of their head, as if acknowledging that an unorthodox approach may be exactly what is required. The colonel holds your gaze. There is a silent oath in his steely eyes, a promise that he will give you a chance—just one chance—to prove yourself. The scientist glances sidelong at you, half-impressed but not yet fully convinced. Her eyes shine with guarded hope.

In one smooth motion, your subordinates breathe in unison, righting their posture. The machines in the chamber whir to higher volumes, as if responding to a collective readiness. Lights flare from the screens, revealing complicated maps and swirling data sets that you don’t yet fully understand. But it doesn’t matter. Within the dream, knowledge becomes malleable, doorways to insight opening where none existed moments before. You feel as though the insignia on your uniform could burn away any veil of ignorance. And so, in the paradoxical logic of slumber, you find the confidence to step forward at the heart of this swirling maelstrom of expertise, declaring your first directive with something that might just be described as grace.

The chamber reverberates with possibility as your words—your dream-forged vow—take flight. Shadows dance along the walls, the tension of the unknown mingling with the embers of determination. Despite the glances of doubt and the hush of unspoken questions, the assembly stands at your back. Together, you move to the next phase of this surreal mission, each step guided by the shimmering badge pinned over your heart, and the intangible spark that ignited the moment you were chosen. And with every breath, the dream grows more radiant, pulsing with the unspoken promise that, somehow, you will lead them all.
