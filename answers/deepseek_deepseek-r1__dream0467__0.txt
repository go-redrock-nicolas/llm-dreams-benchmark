I am dreaming.  

The sky is a liquid tapestry of indigo and mercury, rippling like the belly of a storm. Below, a forest of crystalline trees rises from an obsidian river, each trunk pulsing with veins of gold—bioluminescent sap that hums in harmonies only the soul understands. Between the branches, bridges materialize, spun from threads of starlight. They stretch between the trees, delicate yet unbreakable, their webs glowing brighter when touched. I step onto one, barefoot, and feel the vibration of a thousand distant heartbeats sync with my own.  

A voice echoes—not words, but textures: velvet sorrow, citrus joy, the chill of mountain air. The bridges shiver, rearranging themselves. To cross them, I learn, I must name what I carry: *grief here, hope there, this longing left on the shore*. As I do, the paths clarify. The bridges widen. Other figures emerge on neighboring trees, their outlines blurring at first, then sharpening as they, too, begin to sort their burdens. One lifts a shadow from their chest and places it gently in the river; the water swallows it, transforms it into iridescent fish that leap in arcs of forgiveness.  

At the center of the forest, a tree unlike the others stands—a colossus with roots that plunge into a pool of liquid moonlight. Its branches fork into fractals, each tip holding a sphere of mirrored glass. Inside the spheres, scenes flicker: a child’s laughter, a tear shed in solitude, hands clasping across a chasm. I realize the spheres are lenses, not prisons. To touch one is to see through its surface, to witness a story without being consumed by it. The tree whispers, *"To hold a boundary is to love the whole forest, not just a single leaf."*  

Suddenly, the air thickens with the scent of rain-soaked earth. A figure approaches—a stranger with eyes like dying stars and a cloak woven from midnight. They extend a hand, and for a moment, I fear dissolving into their darkness. But the bridge beneath us flares, its light carving a space between us. Instead of retreating, they laugh, a sound like wind chimes in a hurricane. "You see?" they murmur. "The space *is* the gift." Together, we add a new thread to the web—a taut, luminous line that hums with the weight of unsaid words held sacred.  

When I wake, my palms still glow faintly, etched with constellations only the heart can decipher.
