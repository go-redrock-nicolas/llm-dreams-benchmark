I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the middle of a vast, sterile operating room, surrounded by a dozen pairs of expectant eyes. The scent of antiseptic and something metallic fills the air. Dr. Hayes, a renowned neurosurgeon, approaches me with blood-stained gloves, his usually composed face tense. "Dr. Alan, I need your help. I've developed a sudden tremor and can't continue the procedure."

Heart pounding in my chest, I realize with horror that I'm the only one available to step in. The patient lies motionless on the table, a maze of wires and tubes attached to their motionless form. Dr. Hayes explains in rapid, urgent tones that a critical artery has been nicked during the delicate cerebral aneurysm repair. If not pinpointed and repaired immediately, the patient will bleed out.

The pressure mounts as I slip into his bloody gown and gloves, feeling the weight of responsibility. I study the complex monitors and operating tools, none of which I've ever used before. The patient's vitals are beginning to drop, and I can feel their life slipping away by the second.

My hands shake as I pick up the precise instruments, the room seeming to spin. The fog of panic starts to clear as I focus on the intricate suturing technique Dr. Hayes demonstrated, visualizing the artery's location beneath the maze of neural pathways. I take a steadying breath and make the first delicate incision.

The next 45 minutes blur together in a haze of intense concentration and a miracle of muscle memory from watching medical dramas. Contrary to all logic, my hands move with growing confidence, the stitches falling into place. The bleeding slows, then stops.

The team erupts in collective relief as the patient's vitals stabilize. Dr. Hayes grasps my shoulder, his voice choked with emotion. "You did it. The impossible." In that moment, a stranger's life has been saved by my inexplicable skill. I stand there, dazed and exhausted, unable to comprehend what I've just accomplished.

As the adrenaline fades, reality intrudes. The patient is wheeled away, and I step back from the table, staring in disbelief at the bloodied surgical gown still clinging to my unsteady body. Dr. Hayes hands me a pair of scrubs, his face now etched with confusion. I pa itically empty my pockets - just a student ID and some loose change. No medical credentials, no past to speak of. It's then that I realize with a jolt of terror - this isn't a dream. I have no idea who I really am or how I came to be here in this moment, wielding a scalpel with expert precision.
