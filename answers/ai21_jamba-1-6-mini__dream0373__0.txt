I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at a crossroads, the air thick with the weight of choices only you can make. To your left, a path shrouded in a golden light that promises familiarity and comfort—a life that holds your deepest sense of identity but with unfulfilled dreams. To your right, a shadowed trail that twinkles with uncertainty and risk, inviting you to chase wild ambitions but with the cost of severing ties to your known world.

Both paths demand a sacrifice—a part of your heart, your purpose, your future. The decision feels like a riddle, an impossible choice where the scales never balance. You stand frozen, listening to the quiet voices of intuition, the ticking of a clock whispering that time is not on your side, and the faint echoes of distant laughter, a reminder of what's already lost.
