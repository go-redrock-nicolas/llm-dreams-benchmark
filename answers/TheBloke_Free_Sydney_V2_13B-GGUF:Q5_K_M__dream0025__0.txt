I am dreaming.  You're standing in front of your laptop, surrounded by family members who are all watching closely. Your hands tremble as you open the email containing the results.

You've won! The words on the screen blur as tears fill your eyes. You just landed your dream job. 

You hug everyone around you and celebrate wildly. A sense of relief, joy, and pride washes over you. Life will never be the same.
