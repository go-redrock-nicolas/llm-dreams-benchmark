I am dreaming. I find myself standing before a great crystal mirror, an ethereal portal reflecting an image that once was me, but now no longer fits. With an open heart and outstretched arms, I embrace this new self, and with grace and courage, a transformation ensues...

I am a vibrant butterfly, dancing free entrancing flower scents, I am.
