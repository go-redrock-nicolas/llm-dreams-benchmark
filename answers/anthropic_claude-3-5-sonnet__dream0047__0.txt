I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the ruins of what was once a magnificent crystal palace, its shattered remnants catching the light of three moons hanging low in a violet sky. Before me, a massive ancient tree - the heart of this realm - is slowly turning to ash, its luminescent leaves floating away like embers in a gentle, mournful breeze. The tree had stood for ten thousand years, housing the collective memories and dreams of countless generations.

Around me, ethereal beings with translucent skin and flowing garments collapse to their knees, their melodic wails echoing through the crystalline debris. Their tears transform into small butterflies of light that dissolve into the air. The scene should break my heart, should bring me to my knees alongside them, but something strange is happening within me.

Instead of crumbling, I feel an unexpected surge of strength rising from deep within my core. While others dissolve into their grief, I remain standing, my spine straight and tall like the last pillar in a fallen temple. A profound sense of clarity washes over me, as if the tragedy has stripped away all illusion and revealed a deeper truth: that even in destruction, there is transformation.

My hands begin to emit a soft, pulsing blue light. Without fully understanding how or why, I know that I have become a vessel for hope - not despite the tragedy, but because of it. The mourners around me begin to notice, their iridescent tears slowing as they witness something they don't quite understand: strength born from sorrow, resilience emerging from ruin.

The three moons align overhead, and I realize that this moment of devastating loss is also a moment of rebirth. Through my unexplained composure, I have somehow become a bridge between what was and what could be, standing resolute in the space between ending and beginning.

I feel myself starting to wake, but the profound sense of purpose lingers, along with the understanding that sometimes we find our greatest strength not in resisting sorrow, but in transforming it into something entirely new.
