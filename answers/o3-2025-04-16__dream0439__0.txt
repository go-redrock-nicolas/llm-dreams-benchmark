I am dreaming. …close your eyes and feel yourself slide into the hush between waking and sleeping.  

The first thing you notice is color—impossible color, more feeling than pigment.  Mauves that taste like pomegranate rind, ambers that hum in your bones, a blue so deep it tugs gently at your thoughts the way the tide tugs at anchored boats.  You drift through this chromatic sea until the colors congeal into a landscape: a vast, velvety dunescape under a violet-copper sky.  Giant hourglasses, big as cathedrals, lie half-buried in the sand, their glass bulging with glimmering sugar instead of sand.  Each time you touch a crystal grain, it melts into caramel sweetness on your tongue—instant comfort.  Yet the dunes around every hourglass are pocked with sinkholes where the sugar has drained away, revealing stone teeth below.  Too much sugar, and you can feel the ache already forming where tomorrow’s cavities will yawn.

You walk, nibbling handful after handful, telling yourself you’ll stop after just one more taste.  But with every handful, the sky dims a shade, as though the sunset itself were being consumed.  Off in the distance, a bell rings—once, twice, thrice—slow and mournful, reminding you of all the appointments you’ve missed, the calls you’ve left unanswered, the promises you tucked into shadows to soothe your nerves for “just tonight.”

You try to ignore the bell, shove the sound down with more sweetness.  A new dune appears, studded not with hourglasses but with plush armchairs facing glowing windows.  In each window plays a different loop of comforting distraction: a favorite sitcom episode, a highlight reel of social-media hearts, that moment someone said you were special.  Sit, the chairs whisper.  Rest, just for a second.  Curling into one, you feel your weight dissolve.  The chair rocks you like a lullaby, and all the windows glow brighter—until you notice the ground beneath the chair eroding, thread by thread, exposing a jagged maw beneath the upholstery.

It dawns on you that the landscape is alive: a gigantic ouroboros of instant relief turning forever into slow decay.  Sugar to cavity.  Screen light to sleeplessness.  Cushioned respite to blank regret.  You taste the metallic tang of futility in the back of your throat.

A wind rises, hissing through the dunes.  The sugary hourglasses quake, fractures spider-webbing across their surfaces.  You know what comes next: the shatter, the avalanche, the drowning sweetness that will crystallize into stone around your ankles.  You’ve watched it happen countless times in this recurring dream, and always you wake up just before the collapse—relieved, shaken, but unchanged.

Tonight, something shifts.  The wind brings a sound buried inside its howl: a faint thrum like a heartbeat.  Not your own, but older, steadier, calling you deeper.  You turn away from the chairs, from the hourglasses, from the gravitational pull of easy comfort, and you see—for the first time—a fissure in the horizon, a slender crack of luminescence bleeding into the sky.  It looks too narrow to slip through, but the heartbeat pulses louder, synchronizing with your ribs.

You take a step.  The sugar dunes cling, begging you to stay.  Another step, and needles of craving jab at your skin—chemical memory demanding its fix.  You breathe through it, tasting not caramel this time but smoke and salt and the raw air of possibility.  A third step, and the dunes behind you groan, the chairs fold in on themselves, the luminous windows flicker out.  Yet you keep moving—slow, deliberate, into the wind.

Closer now, you see the crack is a door of living light, its edges shimmering like fish scales.  Above it, etched in molten script, is a phrase that feels both unknown and intimate: WHAT YOU FEED GROWS.  You swallow hard, feel the truth of it swim through your veins, and place a hand upon the glowing seam.

At your touch, sound rushes outward—laughter you’ve never laughed, gratitude you’ve never voiced, dawn choruses you’ve slept right through.  The door dilates, and you step into a garden suspended in starlight.  No ground, no ceiling, only floating terraces over an endless, velvet dusk.  Here, blossoms are made of intentions: tiny lantern-petaled flowers that burn brighter each time you name a future self you want to nourish.  Empathy.  Discipline.  Creative fury.  Quiet joy that needs no applause.  Each intention-flower pops open like a paper lantern, releasing a perfume that smells of petrichor and sunrise.

In the center of the garden stands a tree whose bark glints like beaten bronze.  Instead of fruit, it bears small hourglasses filled with seed-bright pearls.  You understand: these hours are yours to spend, each pearl an act of growth, each turn of the glass a deliberate choice.  You pluck one hourglass from a low branch; it feels unexpectedly heavy, as if stuffed with all the resolve you’ve ever postponed.  Cradling it, you hear once more the distant bell—now softened, almost curious, awaiting your answer.

And so you breathe in the fragrance of freshly opened intentions, feel your spine straighten into possibility, and utter the words that end the cycle: “I trade sugar for seed, habit for harvest.”  The wind stills.  The hourglass in your palm flips itself, pearls tumbling downward with a musical clatter.  They sow themselves into the hovering terraces, sprouting vines of new neural pathways, daring dreams, gentle routines.

The violet-copper sky lightens by a single shade.  Somewhere behind you, the dunes collapse into silence.  Ahead, the garden expands—limitless, patient, alive with tomorrow.  You step forward, barefoot on warm starlight, aware at last that comfort and growth are both kinds of nourishment, but only one carries you beyond the waking edge of dawn.
