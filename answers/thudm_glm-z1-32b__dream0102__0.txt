I am dreaming. Now, I am a therapist seated in a cozy, sunlit room with soft, golden light filtering through stained glass windows panels. My client, a young woman with a tangled mane of hair and features streaked with tears, sits across from me. Her voice is fractured, trembling like autumn leaves in a storm. "I don't know how to stop feeling like I'm falling apart," she sobs. I lean forward, the gentle hum of a Beethoven symphony playing softly from unseen speakers, and say, "Imagine a bridge. Not a solid one, but made of light and memory. Walk across it. Don't look down. The ground isn't the point. You are."

Her face contorts, and she begins to hyperventilate. Suddenly, I'm not a therapist anymore. I'm a traveler, standing on the edge of a cliff overlooking an endless ocean of stars. Each star is a fragment of her fractured soul. My hands touch the constellations, and they rearrange themselves. Orion becomes a swan, Andromeda a labyrinth. She watches, her breathing calming. 

"Change the story," I say, my voice now echoed through the cosmos. "Not the facts, but the genre. If your life feels like a tragedy, rewrite it as a ballad. Or a comedy. The stars won't care what you name them. They just want to be seen." 

She blinks, and the stars freeze. Her tears stop, not because she's happy, but because she's curious. Curiosity beats fear. The sky peels back into a rubbery, neon-blue dome, and we're inside a giant, hollowed-out tree. Inside, there's a Victoriana-era ballroom with chandeliers and a grand piano playing Debussy. She rises, her tears gone, to dance. 

"Follow the music," I tell her. "Dance with the urges, not against them. Even hypervent
I am suspended in a reverie where time unravels like smoke. As therapist, I inhabit a library that sprawls infinitely upward on spiraling, lichen-covered stone pillars. The air hums with the low thrum of ancient Gregorian chants, and the shelves hold books with covers of liquid mercury, spines spelled in languages that shift when unobserved. My client, a man whose face blurs between his 30-year-old self and the withered puppet version of himself he fears becoming, slumps at a desk cluttered with broken pocket watches and wilted lilacs. His grief is a tidal wave, but he’s sitting knee-deep in it, pretending the water isn’t swallowing his shoes.  

“You’ve been trying to outrun the wave? Seen how?” I murmur, tracing glyphs on the air that glow like bioluminescent fungi. He startles, his fractured reflection in the mercury desk lamp dissolving for a heartbeat.  

Before he can answer, the library dissolves. We’re now submerged in an ocean where each current is a memory—cold, electric schools of herring form arguments with spouses he never forgave; sunken shipswrecks are childhood bedrooms, half-submerged in silt. He resists diving, so I shed my jacket, gloves, voi everything human, and become a kelp strand, my roots anchoring us to the seabed.  

“Breathe with the pressure,” I urge, though I’m no longer speaking. My kelp tendrils part, revealing a school of jellyfish that pulse with his suppressed laughter from summer camp, their bellies lighting the way to a cave. Inside, stalactites drip liquid starlight onto a pendulum swinging between existential yes and no. He lunges for the “no” but I propel him toward the “yes,” my kelp now a knight’s helm, gauntlets of coral. The pendulum splinters, releasing a hologram of his 10-year-old self—radiant, unfettered—dancing on the cave’s coral reefs.  

“Claim that child,” I say through chlorophyll whispers. “Steal his fearlessness. Age it, twist it, but let it live.”  

He grabs the hologram, and the water erupts. We surface in a carnival at midnight, rides frozen mid-swing: a Ferris wheel car dangling at the peak, a rollercoaster loop shaped like a question mark. Therides are alive, their metal crying like a wounded animal. The client, now a child again, reaches into his pocket (of shame? ambition?commitment?) and pulls out a Nokia brick phone. He smashes it against the rollercoaster track, and the debris sprouts into sunflowers, their petals spelling *YES* in Braille.  

The carousel horse he’d been clinging to—the one with the cracked sunglasses and one missing eye—begins to gallop, taking him not away, but *through* the ferris wheel. As they ascend, the broken mirrors underneath rearrange his reflection into a mosaic of every version of himself he’s ever hated ored. At the apex, the sky peels back to reveal a clockwork galaxy, where constellations are made of his therapy notes, the words *regret* and *should* and *always* becoming nebulae.  

“You’re the editor,” I say, now a constellation of my own—a supernova spelling *BREATH*. “Not the words. Rewrite the punctuation.”  

He swallows a star and the silence that follows isn’t empty. It hums with the sound of a typewriter, *ding-ding* as he erases decimals and inserts commas between his failures. Below, the carnival burns to ash, the rides collapsing into a pile of colorful, unbreakable Lego. He builds a spaceship from the wreckage, not leaving, but hovering inside it, its engine running on curiosity instead of panic.  

The dream ends not with answers, but with us laughing—a sound like a bell tolling inside a bell. The library reappears, but its mercury books now hold blank pages. The client stands, now ageless, clutching a seashell that plays the sound of a laughterless crowd. He smiles, and I know he’ll return next week with a new metaphor, a different wound to name. Because therapy isn’t about fixing the boat; it’s about learning to capsize gracefully, to let the water fill you until you realize you were liquid all along.
