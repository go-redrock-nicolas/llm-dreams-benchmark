I am dreaming. You're a famous actor who must portray a character that is nothing like you, and everything like them. You have to capture their mannerisms, speech patterns, and even their scent. You are dreaming.

You're a young girl whose family moves into an old house with a hidden room where the previous occupants left behind a strange artifact. Touching it transports you to another world filled with magical creatures and powerful enemies. You are dreaming.
