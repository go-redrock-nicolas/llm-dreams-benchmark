I am dreaming. The dream begins in a twilight garden, where the sky is a mosaic of violets and blues. Flowers bloom with impossible shapes and colors, but there’s an undercurrent of unease. I feel a familiar dread about an evening gathering with others in this garden. Past parties here were lively and joyous, yet something feels different this time... There must be a reason for this sudden anxiety. I need to explore the garden to uncover why this time feels ominous... Maybe the flowers aren’t just pretty but possess some sinister intent. Perhaps the very air holds hidden dangers. Or is the fear emanating from within me, a manifestation of deeper insecurities?

Moving through the garden, the ground softly glows with bioluminescent moss. A path leads to a shimmering lake where trees with mirrored leaves line the banks. Reflections in the water seem distorted, showing not my own face but glimpses of crowded rooms filled with whispering figures. Their voices grow louder as I approach—a chorus of murmurs that coil around my thoughts. The water ripples as a creature rises, translucent and eel-like, with eyes that shimmer like broken glass. It speaks in a voice that isn’t its own: “This time, you will not blend in.”

The dream deepens as the creature disappears beneath the surface, leaving behind a silver thread. Following it, I enter a cavern illuminated by floating orbs. Drawn toward a mirror at the center, it shows a version of me surrounded by others, but everyone wears masks with shifting features. The masks crack, revealing hollow voids where faces should be. Panic surges—this isn’t just about being seen but about the terror of being erased, of losing identity in a swarm of hollow reflections.

Suddenly, I’m back in the garden as twilight deepens into night. The flowers now close up, releasing bioluminescent seeds that drift like fireflies. Some land on my skin, burning cold. Each seed carries a memory—someone’s laughter, a forgotten argument—forcing connection with fragments of others’ lives. The need to flee grows, yet the boundaries between reality and dream dissolve. Perhaps acceptance is key, to embrace the gathering as both chaos and refuge...

Wait—what’s that? A small structure on the horizon glows faintly—maybe a shed or an altar. Venturing closer, I find it filled with countless masks identical to the ones in the cavern. One whispers my name, and touching it, I’m flooded with the feeling of unity. The anxiety eases—a reminder that connection requires vulnerability, even in dream gatherings where identity is fluid...

A soft chime echoes. The garden shifts, flowers reopening to reveal miniature galaxies inside each bloom. The once-threatening reflections now swirl into supportive whispers. Maybe I’ve passed some test of trust in the dream’s logic. The event unfolds, and though uncertainty lingers, there’s also warmth in stepping into the unknown with others...
