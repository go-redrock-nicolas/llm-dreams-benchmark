I am dreaming. **Dream Sequence:**  

You stand at the center of a labyrinth made of mirrors, each pane reflecting not your face but fragmented echoes of your fears: a clenched jaw, narrowed eyes, a voice hissing *“I don’t need this.”* The air tastes metallic, like static before a storm, and the ground shifts beneath your feet—a mosaic of shattered glass that glints like frozen tears.  

A figure emerges, their form shifting between a faceless mentor, a storm-cloud, and a flickering candle. Their voice ripples like distant thunder: *“Why armor your heart against the rain? Even stones soften under water.”* You recoil, but the mirrors hum louder, warping your reflection into a fortress of iron vines and barbed wire. Shadows coil around your wrists, whispering, *“They’ll see your cracks. Stay sharp. Stay closed.”*  

Then, a single mirror cracks. Through the fissure spills liquid moonlight, pooling at your feet. Within it, you see a version of yourself—softer, eyes wide like unshuttered windows—reaching out. Her palm holds a seed, glowing faintly. *“Growth isn’t surrender,”* she murmurs. *“It’s the soil learning to trust the storm.”*  

The labyrinth groans. Walls of glass dissolve into constellations, stars stitching themselves into unfamiliar shapes—a bridge, a spiral, a door. The defensive shadows unravel, thread by thread, until all that remains is your breath, syncopated but steady. The figure who spoke now kneels, offering a cup carved from a storm-churned seashell. Inside swirls not water, but galaxies.  

**Resolution:**  

You sip. The taste is salt and honey, fire and dew. Your chest glows faintly, amber light seeping through the cracks in your armor. The shadows retreat, hissing, but you exhale, and the light swells, dissolving iron into ivy, barbed wire into jasmine.  

The dream ends with your reflection whole but trembling—not fragile, but fluid, like a river reshaping its banks. A voice, yours yet deeper, lingers: *“To grow is to let the world carve canyons where walls once stood.”*  

You wake, your pulse a quiet drum, fingertips tingling as if still brushing stardust.
