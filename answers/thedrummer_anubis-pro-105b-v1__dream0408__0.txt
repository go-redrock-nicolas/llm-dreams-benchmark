I am dreaming. The dream shifts and I'm a small child again, at the dinner table with my parents. I remember how they would frequently argue during meals, their voices hushed but laced with an undercurrent of anger and resentment. I couldn't understand at the time why they always seemed to find fault when we were supposed to be enjoying our time together. Looking back now through adult eyes, I recognize the subtle ways in which their interaction affected me - the way I learned to anticipate conflict, to always be on the lookout for the other shoe to drop. I see how this pattern has played out in my own relationships as I've grown older, the nagging suspicion that no matter how happy things may seem on the surface, there could always be an undercurrent of trouble brewing beneath. But with this new awareness, I feel a sense of peace wash over me. I understand now that I was just a small piece of their parenting, that their relationship wasn't a reflection of my worth. Thank you for guiding me through this journey of self discovery," I say to whomever is in charge of this dream. 

They just smile in that knowing smile that don't ever quite have enough information that I want and everything that I need without wanting. But I'm in control now," I say and in a instant I'm in a grocery store, trying to find the perfect sauce.
