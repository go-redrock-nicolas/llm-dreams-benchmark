I am dreaming. The night sky above me is not like any I have ever known. It ripples with color—emerald waves, violet tides, celestial ribbons dancing in some slow, eternal choreography. Beneath my feet, the ground is soft and golden, a sand that hums instead of crunches. There are no stars in the traditional sense, only pools of liquid starlight suspended in indigo air, drifting freely like jellyfish in an infinite sea of night.

I walk without walking, carried forward by a presence I cannot define but somehow trust implicitly. The world—no, the realm—shifts subtly with each step. Trees made of crystal and whispering moss rise around me, chiming when touched by wind that does not exist. The silence is full, not empty. Breathing is more than oxygen—it is communion.

At the center of a vast glade sits an ancient circle of monoliths, each carved with spirals that spill over themselves like time loops. At the base, flames bloom without fire, glowing a soft crimson, casting no heat. Figures stand amidst them, robes woven from the darkness between stars, eyes reflecting galaxies. They are not human, not precisely—yet their gestures are exquisitely tender, their presence radiating ancient knowing.

A voice touches my soul, not my ears.

_"You are ready now."_

A ritual begins—unfamiliar, yet remembered in the marrow of my being.

The figures begin to move in unison, tracing sigils in the air that flicker with memory—visions of lives I may or may not have lived: a soldier in silver armor standing amidst a dying meadow, a forgotten saint weaving talismans in caves behind waterfalls, a wandering poet whose scent was cedar and star anise. The movements become emotion, memory becomes marrow. Chants fill the air, echoing not in sound but in *sensation*—a pressure that hums in my chest, releasing tears that do not fall but instead dissolve into motes of light.

And then, an altar appears before me—carved from black crystal and suspended in midair, rotating gently. Upon it lie three objects, each glowing faintly with an essence of its own: a mirror that reflects only what I fear to see, a piece of moonlight captured in silver thread, and a stone that pulses gently in rhythm with my heartbeat.

_"Choose,"_ says the voice again, now speaking from *inside* me.

The dream slows, stretches.

There is no wrong path—but only one that calls my soul by *name*.

I reach out...

And with that gesture, a resonance spreads outward like ripples in existence itself, altering realities, unknotting forgotten truths, and awakening something long-endangered, something dormant in the sacred citadel of my soul.

I awaken not with a start—but with a *welcome,* an inner agreement with something vast, unknowable… and wholly mine.
