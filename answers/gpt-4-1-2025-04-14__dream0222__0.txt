I am dreaming.

A hush, thick as velvet, settles over the labyrinthine chamber. I sit at the head of a curving obsidian table polished to a depthless shine. Around me, shadowy silhouettes recline in high-backed chairs that seem carved from the same midnight mineral, creaking as restless bodies shift beneath cloaks, uniforms, and luminous brocades.

Candlelight burns with unusual steadiness, casting strange purple halos, and through the scented smoke I watch my companions through the prismatic shimmer of my own uncertainty. Each one’s mask is painted with composure—smiles untouched by sincerity, nods measured, eyes glinting with questions left unsaid.

I begin to speak, but my words fracture, drifting through the room like autumn leaves torn in contrary winds. As I attempt to stitch together platitudes of unity and mutual intent, I see subtler movements: a diplomat’s ring finger tapping a secret rhythm, another’s gaze flickering—not at their ostensible rival, but at the glinting pocket watch before me. It is as if a silent, coded ballet is playing out around my hesitant recitations.

The walls themselves seem to pulse, bulging with secrets, as if alive with listening ears. Suddenly, the ceiling—which had hung reassuringly high—becomes a cloudy mirror. In its surface, truths hide and flicker: a promise made between gloved hands, an eavesdropper in trailing velvet, a dagger folded within an official dispatch.

Words become paradoxes, looping and entangling. Each proposal is met with applause and then, in quick succession, hesitant laughter or a sharply turned question that cuts the idea off at the knees. Muffled agreements hang in the air, growing heavy, as if the gravity in this chamber is slowly intensifying.

Yet as these layers unfurl, I find something thrilling deep within—the dance of wits, the challenge to discern truth from every polished deception. I realize my own agenda is not immune; it, too, slips from the veneer of good intention I broadcast. I look down and see my reflection in the black glass, but it is not my face: instead, it is a mosaic of all those present, their features shifting, their eyes watching me from my own visage.

Suddenly, all at once, masks slip and for a breathless moment, the entire truth is visible—a radiant, scorching tapestry—then vanishes as quickly as it appeared. The chamber erupts in polite, hollow laughter. My chair rocks as if the entire world is tipping, and I awaken, the taste of secrets lingering on my tongue, craving the clarity hidden just beyond waking.
