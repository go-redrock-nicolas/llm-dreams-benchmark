I am dreaming. …step through a doorway that was never there before.

The door swings out into a sky the color of moonlit ink. Clouds drift below your feet like slow-moving rivers of pearl, and distant constellations pulse to an unheard rhythm, as if stars themselves are breathing. The floor beneath you is a braided path of memories—photographs, snippets of conversations, childhood chalk drawings—fused together into a gleaming mosaic. With each cautious step, an image lights up, then rises as a translucent bubble and floats away, freeing itself from the weight of forgotten judgment.

A wind made of voices circles you—old teachers, ex-lovers, your own younger selves—whispering rules you once swallowed whole:

“You’re too loud.”
“You’re too quiet.”
“Dream smaller.”
“Be realistic.”

Their words weave into chains of shimmering silver, threatening to bind your ankles. But instead of recoiling, you study them. Each chain link contains a miniature scene—moments where you agreed to shrink. You reach out, and the metal softens into strands of liquid mercury. A gentle flick of your fingers sends them splashing into stardust.

Ahead, a colossal staircase spirals upward. Every step is carved from contrasting materials: one of polished oak, the next of molten lava frozen mid-flow, then a slab of transparent ice with goldfish swimming inside. The steps have no pattern—just like your life, improvised and beautiful. You climb.

Halfway up, gravity relaxes its grip. Your feet leave the stairs; you float. Limiting beliefs materialize as glass walls in every direction—some smoky, some crystal-clear, each etched with a single word: “SHOULD,” “NEVER,” “CAN’T.” But the moment you touch them, they ripple like ponds disturbed by a pebble. Your fingertips pass through, and the walls dissolve into showers of kaleidoscopic butterflies that flutter away, carrying the obsolete rules to distant horizons.

At the summit you find a vast, quiet lake suspended in mid-air, surface perfectly still, reflecting galaxies above and below. You lean over, expecting to see your ordinary face, but the water shows forms you’ve tried on throughout your life: the performer, the caretaker, the rebel, the wanderer. They gaze back with knowing smiles, then merge into a single fluid silhouette—limitless, genderless, age-less.

A thought arises: What if possibility is not a doorway to squeeze through, but an ocean to breathe in? You laugh, inhaling the impossible. The lake responds, rising into a luminous tide that lifts you higher. Now you are soaring, weightless, tracing new constellations with sweeps of your arms. For the first time, the stars arrange themselves at your request, spelling out fresh commandments written in pure light:

GROW WIDER.  
SING LOUDER.  
RISK KINDLY.  
LOVE BRAVELY.  
BECOME.

You ride a comet’s tail through the final threshold of the dream, a cerulean veil that shimmers like silk in a summer breeze. On the other side lies nothing predetermined—only iridescent blankness, the perfect canvas.

You open your eyes (still in the dream) and realize the rules were never stone; they were clouds waiting for a breeze.

And so you exhale, gifting them the wind.
