I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air tastes of burnt honey and static, thick with the scent of forgotten libraries and the metallic tang of a storm that hasn’t broken yet. You stand in a cavernous hall where the ceiling swirls like liquid obsidian, constellations blinking in and out of existence as if the stars themselves are holding their breath. Before you, a dais floats inches above the ground, its surface a mosaic of shattered mirrors that reflect not your face, but fragments of lives you’ve never lived—your hands cradling a violin carved from whalebone, your voice summoning rain, your fingers stitching shadows into tapestries that bleed.  

A voice, neither male nor female, reverberates through the chamber: *“You have been chosen for the Conclave of Unseen Arts. To remain, you must perform the Rite of Unspooling.”* The words coil around your throat like silk, tightening until you gasp. You’ve never heard of this Conclave, this Rite. Yet here you are, your pulse a frantic drum beneath your ribs, as robed figures materialize from the walls like smoke given form. Their faces are veiled, but their eyes—luminous, lidless—fix on you with the weight of a thousand unblinking suns.  

A pedestal rises from the floor, cradling an object that hums with latent fury: a *lumenweaver’s quill*, forged from the feather of a thunderbird and tipped with the ash of a dying star. You recognize it from half-remembered myths, a tool used to unravel the threads of reality itself. The other initiates—gaunt, silver-tongued, their hands calloused from decades of clandestine practice—begin their work. One etches equations into the air that bloom into origami swallows. Another sings a melody that hardens into a bridge of ice suspended over nothingness. You clutch the quill, its vibrations rattling your bones, and stare at the blank canvas before you: a void the color of midnight ink.  

Your mind races. You’ve never held a quill like this, never studied the geometry of unraveling. But your hands move anyway, guided by a muscle memory you don’t possess. The tip grazes the void, and for a heartbeat, nothing happens. Then—*a tear*. A jagged rift splits the darkness, spilling forth a cascade of memories not your own: a child’s laughter crystallizing into diamonds, a forest of clock hands ticking backward, a river of liquid amber swallowing a city whole. The rift widens, hungry, and you realize too late that the Rite isn’t creation—it’s *exhumation*. To unspool the world, you must first unspool yourself.  

Panic claws up your throat. The other initiates’ eyes flick to you, their awe tinged with dread. The Conclave’s air shimmers, destabilizing, as if your raw, untrained grief has infected the dream’s architecture. You stumble backward, but the quill sears your palm, binding you to the task. A choice crystallizes: surrender to the unraveling and risk losing every thread of who you are… or forge a new stitch, a new rule, in the loom of this impossible craft.  

The void pulses, waiting.  

Somewhere, a clock ticks backward. Somewhere, a thunderbird screams.  

You close your eyes.  

And begin again.
