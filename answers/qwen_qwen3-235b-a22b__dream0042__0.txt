I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the electric tension of a storm that hasn’t yet broken. You stand atop a spire of glass and moonstone, suspended above a city that floats on the edge of the stratosphere—a labyrinth of bridges woven from starlight, towers that twist like helixes of smoke, and plazas paved with obsidian mirrors reflecting constellations that do not exist in the waking world. Below you, thousands of figures in iridescent robes scurry like ants, adjusting the final details of the *Convergence of the Spheres*, an event held once every millennium to bind the fractured realms of the cosmos into harmony. You are the Grand Architect of this ceremony, the sole mind entrusted with aligning the celestial gears, the harmonic chants, the alchemical brews that will fuse time and space into a single, resonant note. Failure would unravel the fabric of reality itself.  

The first crack in the plan appears at dawn—or what passes for dawn here, when the twin suns of Virelia and Theros graze the horizon like lovers’ fingertips. The *Orrery of Eternity*, the colossal mechanism at the heart of the plaza, begins to stutter. Its rings, forged from the bones of dead stars, grind against one another with a sound like shattering violins. The Starlight Choir, whose voices must weave the final thread of the cosmic tapestry, arrives late, their throats swollen and raw from an inexplicable plague of silence. You race to adjust the schedule, but the Astral Weave—the invisible net that holds the realms together—shimmers with ominous gaps, like a spiderweb dissolving in rain.  

Then the Luminaries arrive. Not the ones you invited, but twisted doppelgängers, their faces smooth as polished onyx, their words echoing backward. They demand revisions to the ritual, citing ancient clauses in the *Codex of Unmaking*. You argue, but your voice sounds thin, distant, as though the dream itself is muffling your urgency. A scribe materializes at your side, only to dissolve into a flock of ink-black moths when you glance at their face. The guest list, written in your own blood, now includes names you never penned: *The Hollow King*, *The Drowned Oracle*, *The Child Who Swallowed the Moon*.  

As twilight bleeds across the sky, the final catastrophe strikes. The *Chalice of Echoes*, the artifact meant to channel the Convergence’s energy, is missing. In its place lies a single raven feather, still twitching with residual magic. Panic claws at your ribs, but you cannot breathe deeply—the air has thickened into syrup, sweet and cloying, tasting of burnt honey and regret. You sprint through the fractal corridors of the Celestial Archive, where books scream when opened, their pages fluttering like trapped birds. A shadow trails you, not your own, but something broader, horned, its breath a cold that leaches color from the walls.  

In the end, you find the chalice in the hands of a child—no, not a child, but the *memory* of one, flickering like a dying hologram. They offer no explanation, only a riddle: *“What binds the weaver but cannot be woven?”* You answer without thinking—*“The void”*—and the chalice ignites in your hands, searing your palms with constellations.  

The ceremony begins. The Orrery lurches into motion, the Choir’s mangled harmonies somehow resolving into something transcendent, the Luminaries melting into the crowd like sugar sculptures in a storm. You raise the chalice, and the realms shudder, knitting themselves together with threads of light and screams. For a heartbeat, everything is perfect.  

Then you wake.  

But the taste of honey and regret lingers. And on your palm, a faint mark glimmers—a tiny, perfect spiral, like the eye of a galaxy.
