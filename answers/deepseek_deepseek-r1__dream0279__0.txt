I am dreaming. **The Dream:**  

You stand at the edge of a labyrinth carved from black glass and obsidian, its walls slick with rain that falls upward into a bruise-colored sky. The air smells of burnt iron and wilted roses. This labyrinth has haunted your dreams for months—its corridors shift each night, mocking your attempts to reach the pulsing, golden Light that glows at its heart. You’ve chased it endlessly, only to watch it gutter and vanish when you stretch your hand toward it, leaving your palms scraped raw against jagged walls.  

But tonight feels different.  

The labyrinth is collapsing.  

Great shards of glass splinter from the walls as you run, slicing your arms, streaking the ground with liquid shadow that pools like blood. Above, the constellations unravel—stars drip like molten silver, hissing as they hit the earth. The Light ahead flickers violently, morphing into a wraith-like shape that whispers your name in a voice you’ve never heard but somehow *know*. It sounds like home. Like a truth you buried.  

You sprint faster, boots crunching on shattered sky, until—*there*—the Light solidifies into a radiant orb, suspended above a precipice at the labyrinth’s core. But as you leap to grasp it, a crow with wings of molten gold slams into your chest, knocking you backward. Its beak splits into a human mouth, cackling: *“Again? Still? How many times will you let it break you?”*  

Beneath you, the ground gives way. You fall—but instead of plummeting, you float downward into an abyss lined with thousands of flickering eyes. Their pupils are miniature versions of *you*: you weeping, you raging, you kneeling in defeat. The eyes blink in unison, murmuring, *“Turn back.”*  

But you don’t.  

You surrender to the fall… and land softly in a valley where the air is thick with pollen from black lilies. A bridge of rotten wood stretches before you, arching over a river of liquid mercury. Across it, the Light pulses—dimmer now, but still alive. Halfway across the bridge, the planks crack. You cling to the ropes as the structure disintegrates, but your grip slips, and you plunge into the mercury.  

Instead of drowning, you dissolve.  

Your body becomes a storm of diamond-edged petals, swirling upward into a sky now stitched with constellations of your own design. The crow reappears, its golden wings shedding feathers that transform into moths carrying fragments of your memories: the first time you dared to dream this goal, the scars from each failure, the nights spent whispering, *“One more try.”*  

You coalesce anew at the mouth of a cave where the Light flickers weakly, its glow almost spent. Inside, a mirror awaits. Not a reflection of who you are, but of *who you’ve refused to become*: a version of yourself fiercer, softer, unafraid of the dark. This other you presses a hand to the glass, and the barrier shatters…  

**You wake.**  

Sunlight streams through your window, but your skin still hums with the afterglow of the Light. On your bedside table, a single black lily rests in a pool of melted gold. Somewhere, faint and far off, a crow laughs.
