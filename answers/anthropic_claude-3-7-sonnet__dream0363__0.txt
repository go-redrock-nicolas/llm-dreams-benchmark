I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast library that stretches endlessly in all directions. The ceiling arches impossibly high, disappearing into darkness where ancient chandeliers hang like distant constellations. Books line every shelf, their spines glowing with a subtle luminescence that seems to pulse with knowledge forgotten and remembered.

I'm searching for something, though I can't quite recall what. My fingers trace along leather-bound volumes as I walk, each one whispering fragments of stories as I pass. The air is heavy with the scent of old parchment and something else—something burning.

Turning a corner, I discover a small reading nook where a person sits hunched over a desk, furiously scratching notes onto paper. With a jolt, I realize it's me—another version of myself—working with such intensity that the pen is leaving scorch marks on the page.

Without warning, the other me looks up, eyes blazing with barely contained rage. "You've been avoiding this," my doppelgänger hisses. "You've buried it deep, but it's been growing, feeding on your silence."

Suddenly, the books around us begin to tremble. Pages tear free, swirling into a vortex of words and images—all depicting scenes from my past, moments when I swallowed my true feelings, instances where I smiled while screaming inside.

The maelstrom of paper ignites, transforming into a fiery tempest that doesn't burn me but surrounds me, reflecting my own face distorted with years of unspoken fury. The heat is overwhelming, yet somehow clarifying.

"Let it out," commands my other self, rising from the chair as the library begins to crumble around us. "Or it will consume you from within."

I open my mouth and release a primal scream that shatters the whirlwind of fire into a thousand glowing embers. Each one contains a truth I've been afraid to face, now floating gently around me like fireflies, illuminating the darkness rather than burning it down.

As I reach out to touch one of these glowing fragments, the library reconstructs itself, but differently—brighter, more open, with windows that weren't there before. My doppelgänger is gone, but I no longer feel alone.

The anger has transformed into understanding, its energy redirected rather than extinguished. I realize that what I've been searching for wasn't hidden in any book, but within myself all along.

I wake with tears on my face, but my heart feels unexpectedly light—as though something heavy has finally been set down after being carried for far too long.
