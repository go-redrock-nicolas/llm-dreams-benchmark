I am dreaming. You are wandering through the city at twilight, and the sky has taken on a strange, silvery hue that makes every surface glimmer like mother-of-pearl. Towering skyscrapers loom overhead, their windows reflecting your puzzled face, while the streets are unusually quiet—no bustle of traffic, no hum of conversation. The air is heavy, like a storm simmering just out of sight, and you can almost taste the crackle of electric tension on your tongue.

Despite the unfamiliar hush, neon signs continue to flash hypnotically, splashing bold blues and reds onto the sidewalks. You notice something that makes your heart skip: a pattern in the lights. Each marquee seems to glow for just a moment longer than it should, a slight tremor pulsing through its letters. At first, you dismiss it as a glitch, but then the pattern grows. The flicker travels from sign to sign, forming an accidental code that only you seem able to decipher: a forewarning that something big—something catastrophic—is about to unfold.

An unnatural wind sweeps across your path and rattles the metal gates of shuttered shops. Posters peel from the walls in unison, curling and uncurling as if alive. You step forward, feeling your pulse pound in your temples. That’s when you see them: crows perched along the telephone wires overhead, unusually still and watching with sharp, alert eyes. Each crow shifts slightly, as though waiting for a silent signal. Your chest tightens with dread: these birds sense the oncoming storm too, and their inky silhouettes against the sky seem like living exclamation points, warning you to pay attention.

Desperate to alert someone—anyone—you pivot toward a cluster of people milling about a nearby plaza, their clothes vibrant but their expressions absent. They’re engrossed in their own routines, chattering about mundane worries while oblivious to the subtle upheaval crackling in the air. No one else can feel it, see it, or sense it the way you do. A siren wails faintly in the distance—so faint you might have imagined it—but the hair at the back of your neck bristles, urging you onward.

You rush toward a storefront with a radio drone echoing inside, searching for a hint of official notice. The radio’s signal is garbled, but you catch flickers of static-laced words: “...uncertain… precaution… avoid panic…” Your ears strain to glean more. Suddenly, the static intensifies, and the overhead lights buzz angrily. Shadows ripple unnaturally across the floor, merging into shapes that look like snarling beasts made of living darkness. With each thundering beat of your heart, the shadows recede, but you know they are still waiting, concealed just beyond sight.

The buildings themselves appear to groan, their foundations quivering as if the city were a sleeping giant on the brink of sudden awakening. You call out to the people in the plaza, your voice trembling with urgency, but nobody meets your gaze. They smile politely and keep talking about trivial matters, as though you’re just some passerby with an overactive imagination. You can feel time warping and stretching in your mind; each second thrums with the weight of impending disaster.

And then—a single crow lets out a piercing cry. The rest of the flock takes flight in a swirling mass of black feathers, rising from the telephone wires like an inky tornado that eclipses the waning light. This is it, you realize. The sign you needed. The final piece. The crows scatter and circle overhead, forming a great spiral in the darkening sky. A tremor rattles the windows, and distant thunder—or is it an explosion?—punctuates the eerie stillness.

Your adrenaline skyrockets. Every instinct screams that you must warn the city. You don’t know what form it will take—maybe an unstoppable flood, maybe something even more otherworldly—but you are certain the danger is real, imminent, and monstrous. You rush through empty alleys, your breath hitching in your throat, passing towering murals splashed with swirling colors that seem to watch you with living eyes. The cobblestones under your feet radiate with a soft glow, almost guiding you deeper into the dream.

Embers swirl across your vision, dancing in an agitated wind. You finally reach a wide-open square where a single lamppost flickers like a lone sentinel in the gloom. Summoning every ounce of courage, you shout to the faceless figures drifting around you, your voice echoing off the towering architecture. “Listen to me!” you cry, but your words are swallowed by a silence so deafening it feels alive. The crows overhead let out another collective shriek, and a shimmering crack zigzags through the cloudy sky.

Heart racing, breath ragged, you realize you stand on the edge of a moment—an invisible barrier that separates safety from chaos. You don’t know who will finally hear you, whether anyone will notice the disturbances in the neon lights, the tense hush in the air, or the coded flicker of warnings written in the city’s own electric heartbeat. But you do know you’ll fight to be heard, to sound the alarm. And as your dream self opens its mouth to shout once more, the city bristles—a living entity preparing for the storm—and you feel the tremor of that unstoppable wave bearing down, ready to sweep through the streets.
