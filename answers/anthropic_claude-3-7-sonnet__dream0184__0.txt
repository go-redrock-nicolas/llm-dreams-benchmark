I am dreaming. I find myself in a topsy-turvy cosmos where the fabric of reality obeys inverse probability. Here, lottery winners grumble at their predictable fortunes, while dropping a piece of toast results in it landing butter-side up—a shocking rarity that draws gasps from onlookers.

I wander through a city where buildings occasionally float, their foundations becoming untethered when architectural physics decides to follow its normal rules—an unusual occurrence in this realm. Rain falls upward into cotton candy clouds, but only when meteorologists forecast sunshine. People carry umbrellas to shield themselves from unexpected bursts of clarity rather than precipitation.

In a park, I watch children playing games where losing is celebrated with elaborate ceremonies, while winners sit alone, embarrassed by their statistical anomaly. Trees grow crystalline fruits that chime like bells in absolute stillness, yet remain silent during gusts of wind.

I discover I can navigate this strange world by intentionally miscalculating my routes. When I firmly believe I'm heading toward the ocean, I find myself in a mountain meadow where butterflies with stained-glass wings recite forgotten poems. The surest way to find a specific location is to have no intention of going there at all.

Night and day reverse at random intervals, with dusk transforming into dawn through cascades of prismatic light that fold time into origami dimensions. Throughout this phantasmagorical landscape, improbability physics manifests as visible ripples—multicolored waves of potential that collapse into existence when least expected.

In this dream world, I learn to trust uncertainty and embrace paradox, finding beauty in the perpetual state of wonderment that comes from inhabiting a universe where only the impossible is inevitable.
