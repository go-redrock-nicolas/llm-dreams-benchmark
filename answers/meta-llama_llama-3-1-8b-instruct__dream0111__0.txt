I am dreaming. In this surreal world, I find myself standing in a sprawling, sleek hospital, surrounded by an eerie silence. The fluorescent lights above seem to hum in unison, casting a mesmerizing glow on the sterile white walls. I'm clad in a crisp, crisp white coat, but my soul screams in protest - I have no business being here. I'm a master of nothing, a novice in everything. And yet, fate seems to have anointed me to perform the most delicate and treacherous of operations: brain surgery.

Before me lies a hospital bed, where my patient - a kind-faced individual with a gaze that echoes my own doubts - lies Motionless, a gentle beading of sweat on their brow the only sign of the terror that surely grips them. I glance down at the instrument-laden tray beside me, my hand hesitates, and my mind freezes. A scalpel, glinting in the pale light, seems to mock me, its cold edge whispering 'you're going to kill them.'

The clock ticks away, time unwinding its threads at an agonizing pace, as the icy grip of doubt slowly tightens around my heart. Something within me screams, no, this can't be happening! How did I end up here? Where's the skill, the finesse, or even basic medical knowledge? And yet, as I clutch the limp scalpel, I feel myself rising above my raw terror. For in the depths of my being lies a voice - it's fragmented, desperate, and determined, urging me onward.

The anesthesia machine beside me beeps quietly, its steady rhythm serving as a heartless counterpoint to the panicked thoughts churning in my mind. Dr. Smith, the chief surgeon, steps in beside me, his voice stern, authoritative, yet rich with empathy. 'Not to worry, kid, we trust your instincts. We chose you for a reason.' His words dangle in the air like an unspoken message. 'Do it, kid.'

In this sea of uncertainty, one certain truth smolders within me like an ember. There is a fragile balance of life, hidden away just beneath my shaking hand, praying that I would choose compassion, intuition, sheer unrefined willpower over logic. That quiet intuition has somehow woken within me a unique bond with the tremulous person I'm trying to save.

Stingingly aware of every misjudged, nervous twitch of mine muscles and each queasy heartbeat, I swallow - I gather each drop of courage - and the delicate glint of that tool begins rising into sight. At once glinting and resolute, the scalpel comes to life under my steadied grip.
