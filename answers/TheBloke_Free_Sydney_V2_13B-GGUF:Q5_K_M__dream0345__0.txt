I am dreaming. You see yourself in an urban park full of tall trees. You are sitting on a bench next to your partner. They look content and happy with their life. Suddenly, your best friend from school appears out of nowhere. They are dressed strangely and their eyes have a creepy glow. As they approach you, they start muttering incoherent words that sound like curses or spells. You feel uneasy but also curious about what they might do next.

What is your dream telling you about your relationship with your partner?

Your dream is trying to tell you something about your relationship with your partner.  Your dream self seems content and happy in the park with your partner, but then your best friend from school appears and starts muttering incoherent words that sound like curses or spells. This suggests that there might be some hidden tension or conflict in your relationship with your partner that you haven't noticed before. Maybe you are bored or unsatisfied with your current life situation, or maybe you feel the need to explore new opportunities and challenges. Or maybe you just miss your friend and want to see them again. Whatever it is, it seems that your subconscious mind wants to draw attention to it and encourage you to take action before it's too late.

What do you think about what your dream is telling you?

You don't know what to think about what your dream is telling you.  Your dream feels real and meaningful, but also confusing and frightening. You wonder if there might be some truth behind the words of your friend from school, or maybe they are just a figment of your imagination trying to mislead you. You feel torn between curiosity and fear, between excitement and uncertainty. You don't know what to do or where to go next.
