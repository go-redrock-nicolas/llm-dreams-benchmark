I am dreaming. …fall asleep at your desk, the soft blue glow of your monitor pooling around your fingers like moon-lit water.   
In the dream you open your eyes to discover that your cubicle has morphed into an endless, candle-lit corridor of desks. Paperwork drifts through the air like migrating moths, every sheet stamped with big red exclamation points that pulse in time with your heartbeat. Above, fluorescent tubes dangle from threads as thin as spider silk, swaying, humming, threatening to fall at the slightest sigh.

A clock the size of a planet hangs where the ceiling should be, its hands sprinting rather than ticking, spinning so fast they blur into a silver halo. Whenever they complete a frantic circle you feel an invisible belt tighten around your chest—deadlines turning into literal binds. From the far end of the corridor comes a low, metronomic boom: the company’s performance drum, each thud reinforcing the tempo of “More. Faster. More. Faster.”

Suddenly your keyboard sprouts vines: cables twist into stems, keys pop off and bloom into tiny black blossoms that whisper figures and metrics instead of releasing perfume. If you lean in close, you hear them chanting your quarterly targets in sing-song voices, like nursery rhymes gone wrong.

Your manager materializes—not the real one, but a dream effigy. Half of him is business suit, half of him is jittering spreadsheet. His tie is a serpent of ticker symbols that hisses about cost-of-living, bills, groceries, rent. When he opens his mouth, no words come out—only staplers, tumbling downward and clacking shut, each metallic SNAP punctuating “You can’t leave. You can’t leave.”

The corridor tilts like a seesaw. Desks slide past you with a shriek of metal on tile, piling into a mountain of swivel chairs and shredded memos. High atop that mountain is a fragile glass piggy bank—your savings—flickering in and out of focus. Every time you try to climb closer, the incline steepens, and the papers underfoot slick with fluorescent light become a treadmill, accelerating, dragging you backwards toward a chasm labeled Burnout.

But then a small, surprising breeze filters through the suffocating air: the scent of pine and campfire smoke—memories of vacations you never took. A hatch appears in the floor, outlined in glowing green, marked “Exit Strategy.” When you press it, the corridor shimmers into a forest clearing at dawn. The monstrous clock overhead cracks like an eggshell, releasing a flock of starlings that scatter the red exclamation points, shredding deadlines into confetti.

In this clearing, money no longer chases you; coins drift down as silver leaves, catching sunlight and settling softly into the grass. You pick one up and notice it bears the inscription “Worth  Wage.” As you read it aloud, chains of printer cable snap from your wrists, the vines around your keyboard retreat into the soil, and the distant performance drum dissolves into the gentle drumming of rain on tree canopies.

You breathe deeper—each inhale pulling in birdsong instead of fluorescent buzz. You realize the forest is not an escape but a possibility, a blueprint sketched in green and gold, showing paths that branch toward balance, study, new work, sabbatical. The trees bend forward like mentors, and their bark ripples into phrases:

“Your skills are seeds.”  
“Plant them where light is kind.”  
“Growth needs open sky.”

You follow a narrow footpath of bioluminescent pebbles—each pebble glowing brighter when your foot lands, as if affirming every step. Along the way, phantom invoices drift past, trying to clasp your ankles, but they burst into feathers at contact. The path ends at a mirror-smooth lake that reflects not your office self but a version of you holding a paintbrush, a toolkit, a passport—whatever symbols of freedom resonate most deeply. Behind that reflection stands your real apartment, your desk, your manager…but they’re distant, muted, behind glass.

You kneel, touch the water, and your cubicle walls collapse into ripples, folding inside the lake like origami. You raise your head and discover dawn blooming a second time—this time in the waking world. The birds outside your window chirp exactly where the starlings disappeared, and the inflation-tight belt around your chest has become the gentle weight of a blanket.

You remember the dream’s final whisper—equal parts promise and dare:

“The pressure is real, but so is the door.”  

You stretch, sunlight edging across your floor, and begin drafting a plan—tiny steps at first, but each etched with the glow of those forest pebbles—toward a workplace, a life, where deadlines don’t pulse like shackles, and worth is measured in breath, laughter, and the pace you choose.
