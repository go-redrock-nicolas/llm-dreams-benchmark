I am dreaming. I stand not in a courtroom, but in the hollowed-out core of a vast, luminous tree, its gnarled roots plunging into the abyss below and its branches stretching into an endless twilight sky. The air hums with unseen forces, thick with the scent of petrichor and burnt ozone. Before me, the disputants loom—ethereal, impossible, dripping with power.  

To my left, the Monarch of Storms, a shifting form of crackling thunderheads and silver lightning, eyes like twin hurricanes drilling into mine. They argue that the wind must be freed from the grip of earthly order, that chaos is its birthright, that cities should tremble at its whim. Their voice is the scream of a gale through canyon walls.  

To my right, the Architect of Foundations, a being of polished marble and molten gold, their body an ever-rearranging puzzle of sacred geometry. They insist that the wind must be bound by law, harnessed, directed—that without their careful design, the world will scatter into entropy. Their words toll like a slow, inevitable bell.  

Neither is wrong. Neither is right. The pressure of the decision prickles my skin. The roots beneath my feet tremble in anticipation. The world holds its breath.  

And then—I wake, the echoes of a verdict still unspoken, lost between dreaming and dawn.
