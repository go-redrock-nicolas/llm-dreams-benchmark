I am dreaming. I entered a grand hall with high ceilings and stained glass windows showing scenes from myths I don’t recognize. Groups of people in flowing robes are scattered around, some whispering into crystalline orbs held to their ears. The air smells like burnt roses and ozone.\nThe grand hall stretches before me, its vaulted ceilings lost in shadows where the light from stained glass doesn’t reach. The windows hum faintly, each pane a kaleidoscope of stories—not myths, but *future* events playing in reverse, like clockwork reversed gears. A figure in a robe the color of twilight approaches, their face a shifting mosaic of other faces I’ve seen here. They hold out a orb that pulses with liquid starlight.  

“Your truth,” they murmur, not unkindly. “The chamber hungers to hear it.”  

Around us, the others have stilled. Their orbs glow brighter, their whispersa of expectation. I feel the weight of centuries in this place—a library of secrets, a museum of confessions. My throat tightens; the air now tastes metallic, like blood and possibility. A step forward, and the floor tiles respond, etching faint symbols beneath my feet. Each step I take makes the walls shiver, revealing glimpses of my own fears and desires projected in technicolor on ancient stone.  

I open my mouth.  

But before the words can form—the ones they want, the ones I dread—the floor ripples like water. A key drops into my palm from nowhere, its teeth glowing ice-blue. The twilight-robed figure stiffens, and the orbs dim as the crowd’s hum drops to a hiss.  

“What is *that*?” another voice cuts in, sharp as a shard of crystal. Someone new enters, cloaked in a cloak patched with eyes that blink. They pluck the key from my hand with three talon-like fingers, their grin both playful and jagged. “Ah. You’ve found the Latch Opener. The game’s not confession tonight—it’s escape.”  

The stained glass windows shatter into prisms that swarm like wasps, re-forming into a door I’ve never seen before. The chamber’s temperature plummets, and frost spirals across the floor in sigils I don’t need to translate.  

Run? Or confess? The choice fractures the dream into possibilities. Behind me, the crowd’s whispers sharpen into threats. Before me, the stranger beckons, eyes flickering with mischief and menace. Above, the reversed myths in the glass flicker toward their original direction—forward, toward endings unknown.  

The key's glow fades... and I realize it’s syncing to *my* heartbeat.  

The world narrows until there’s only the weight of the door, the pull of the crowd, and the echo of my own name spoken in a language not meant for human lips.
