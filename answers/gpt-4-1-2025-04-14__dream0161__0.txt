I am dreaming.

I trudge onward, the world shrinking to a tunnel of swirling white. The wind howls like a hungry beast, lashing my face and tugging at my coat until my limbs ache from the cold. Each step feels unsteady—rocks shift beneath my boots and the ridge drops away into nothingness on either side. The blizzard covers everything with blinding snow, reducing the landscape to ghostly shadows and shifting shapes.

Suddenly, the edge beneath my foot crumbles, and panic claws at my chest. For a moment, I teeter above the abyss, heart hammering in my frozen chest. I catch myself, clinging to the jagged rock. My breath fogs, then vanishes instantly in the icy gale.

A strange light pulses ahead, like a lantern or a beacon, unreal against the storm’s rage. It flickers blue and gold, changing shape—sometimes a swaying flame, other times a pair of luminous eyes peering through the snow. Driven by desperation and wonder, I press on, the allure of the glow pulling me forward with each trembling step.

My mind plays tricks as I stumble onward. I swear I hear music—a distant, resonant chime blooming in the heart of the storm, mingling with the wail of the wind. The cold becomes a cocoon, pressing against my ribs, scouring every thought until all I know is the path beneath my boots, the roar of the blizzard, and that mysterious beckoning light leading me deeper into the dream’s embrace.

Shapes emerge—towering ice spires jut from the ridge, gleaming in impossible colors beneath the sporadic flashes of lightning. Snowflakes spiral slowly in their own gravity, heavy as gemstones. Time grows strange, minutes fracturing into hours or blending into seconds, and I realize that the journey is infinite, stretching through space and memory.

Somewhere ahead, past the jaws of the mountain and the siren song of the wind, waits the source of that impossible illumination—a revelation shimmering in the blizzard’s depths, as elusive and wondrous as hope itself.
