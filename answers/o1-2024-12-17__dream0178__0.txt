I am dreaming. You find yourself in a grand marble hall, stretching so high you can scarcely see the tips of the vaulted ceilings, lost somewhere in the shadows and flickering torchlight. Slivers of silver moonlight slant through a set of tinted stained-glass windows, painting the pristine white floor with dancing hues of violet, blue, and pale gold. A mellow hush fills the space, thick and palpable—like a living, pulsing entity beating in time with your own heart.

Rows of solemn figures stand motionless beneath an enormous chandelier of wrought iron and crystal, which sways slightly, as though it, too, feels the tension in the air. The people around you wear austere black garments edged with subtle embroidery that glints in the faint light. Their faces, half-obscured by the gloom, bear expressions etched in stone: eyes lowered, mouths set in tight lines, cheeks devoid of color. There is a reverence here, a hush that demands respect.

Yet, there is an itch deep in your chest—like a trapped bubble fighting to surface. It starts as the faintest tickle, barely noticeable, but it grows with each breath you take. At first, the hush in the hall absorbs it. Then, as your eyes drift over the austere gathering—one person dabbing at a tear, another pressing hands solemnly together, and someone else clearing their throat so softly it’s almost imperceptible—you feel the tickle strengthen. A giggle tries to bloom in your lungs.

You clamp your jaws together, determined to quash this scandalous urge, but the more you resist, the stronger it becomes. It’s like trying to hold down quicksilver: the mischief seeps through your chest, tingling in your ribcage, traveling up to your throat. A wave of hilarity rolls through you with the force of a spring storm. Your face grows hot. A suspect squeak escapes your lips, echoing—and in the hush of this somber hall, it sounds impossibly loud. You freeze. A few heads turn your way, brows knit in confusion, or worse, quiet condemnation.

Your stomach knots as your attempted composure staggers under the rising tide of suppressed amusement. You become acutely aware of every intake of breath, of your heart pounding like a metronome set to an ever-quickening tempo. The reverent hush of the assembly only amplifies the absurdity you feel. A speaker at the front, poised behind a tall marble lectern, drones on in a low, serious voice. The words, though muffled, carry a heavy gravity that demands complete respect. But to you, in this ill-timed moment, their syllables somehow bounce and echo so strangely that each solemn phrase strikes you as comically magnified, feeding your unwanted mirth.

Perspiration beads at your temples. You catch your reflection in the polished marble column next to you: wide, anxious eyes and quivering lips. The hush around you warps into a thundering silence—your pulse thrums in your ears. The chandelier above seems to shimmer in and out of focus, as though its crystals are winking at you, in on the joke. You bite your tongue, press your fingertips into your palms, do everything you can to stop the giggles from exploding into a burst of inexcusable laughter.

All at once, the speaker’s voice wavers, and the hush in the hall deepens. Every pair of eyes—velvety dark in this half light—seems drawn to you, as if they can sense something roiling in your chest. Pins and needles dance along your spine; you’re certain you’ve been discovered. Yet, impossibly, you choke back the laughter like swallowing a mouthful of cackling birds, your shoulders trembling with the exertion to remain still.

Moments stretch like thick ribbons. You hold your breath so long you feel faint, your lungs tightening. Then a single, low cough from someone on the far side of the hall cuts through the stillness. As if on cue, the tension in your body breaks for just an instant—and that’s all it takes. The tiniest sound, half cough, half laugh, escapes your lips. It reverberates against the marble walls like a mischievous echo, bounding up toward the chandeliers. A wave of relief and horror hits you at the same time. Any second now, you expect the somber congregation to turn their heads in collective outrage, their stares freezing you in place.

But instead, everything slows: the chandeliers’ crystals seem to revolve in slow motion, casting spots of light that swirl around the hall like drifting stars. The air goes heavier still, and for one staggering moment, it feels like no one even breathes—frozen in statuesque readiness. Someone in the front row twitches, their black lace sleeve shifting over a stiff, folded hand, yet no one confronts you. The hush returns, quieter and more charged than before, as if the very environment is holding its breath alongside you.

All the while, your laughter, like a caged spirit, thrashes inside your chest, threatening to break free. You glimpse a swirl of color in the shadows, a fleeting swirl of pastel shapes coalescing into something intangible—this is a dream, after all. The shapes flicker, then vanish, leaving you swaying with relief or confusion. You can’t decide which. The hush remains, overpowering and sacred. And yet your heart continues to flutter in a giddy revolt at all this solemnity.

Then, just as it reaches the peak of unbearable tension, reality itself wavers in your periphery. The columns tremble, turning into tall, impossibly thin dancers in black attire. Golden motes of dust swirl skyward, trailing after those paralytic figures. High above you, the chandelier transforms into a glowing orb, its crystals peeling away and dancing like enchanted fireflies. The hush hums. It has a sound now—like a deep, whispering ocean.

You breathe in, prepared at last to let your forbidden laughter burst loose, unflinching in its comedic grandeur. But in a heartbeat, your amusement dissolves: the dreamlike pulses of color and floating crystals vanish; the marble halls fade to gray, pulling away from you until there’s only an empty expanse around you. Your laughter withers, replaced by a strange calm. You stand in solitude, swallowing the last echo of a giggle that never fully blossomed. 

In that instant, the dream recedes, as though you’re a diver rushing up through dark waters into daylight. The pressure fizzles in your head, your vision dims, and you awaken—heart pounding, an involuntary smile still curving your lips, charged by that lingering ripple of unspent laughter.
