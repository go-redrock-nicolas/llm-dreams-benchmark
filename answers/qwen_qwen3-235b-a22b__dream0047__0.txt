I am dreaming. And in that dream, I find myself at the edge of a world that cannot exist. A sorrow-smeared horizon stretches before me, stained crimson with twilight and broken by towers of glass that rise, jagged and fractured, from the earth like scars given shape. Beneath my feet, the ground is neither solid nor soft—it shimmers with a memory of existence, as though the soil remembers dreams it could never live.

People—translucent, flickering like candle flames—kneel all around. They weep, their tears falling in slow, silent droplets that turn to flame before they hit the earth. In the center of the ruined square, among the broken shards of glass and brittle air, lies a great creature. Once divine, now lifeless. A sky-whale. Its body curves like a fallen cathedral, skin dappled with glowing constellations now dimming. Every breath it once took stretched the clouds. Now it lies still—slain by something unseen, something unspeakable.

I do not move.

Even as the ghosts crumble beneath their own tears, hands pressed to the broken sky, even as they scream toward the heavens with the kind of anguish only felt in endings—I only stare.

My hands do not tremble.

The wind howls a funeral dirge through the fractured spires, and I feel it—a hollow space inside me widen, but no tears rise to meet it. My chest bears the echo of grief without release, like a storm trapped waiting to leave but forbidden motion.

It’s not that I feel nothing—oh no—that is not it. I feel it all. Every fiber of loss. Every note of broken beauty sung too short. But the sorrow in me goes too deep for weeping; it pools and thickens like centuries-old ink, black with memory, too full to spill.

I step forward. My feet make no sound.

With each step, the vision around me twists slightly, as if reacting not to me, but to what waits inside me. The sky crackles with unseen constellations rearranging. The whale’s eye, cloudy now, turns toward me—or so I imagine. As though death had not yet found the angle to fully blind it.

I kneel. Not to grieve.

I kneel to remember. Not the creature. But the song it sang. I remember that. A song woven into the bones of the stars themselves. A song lost now, choked by silence. But I remember.

And as I do, a flicker of something rises from my chest—not flame, not air, not sound... but a shimmer of intention. A warmth that does not weep. A warmth that dares to cradle what was, not with fingers worn thin by loss, but with something sterner and subtler: silent remembrance, and the quiet architecture of rising again.

Around me, the dream hums.

And I close my eyes—not to sleep, but to begin again.

For mourning, I have found, is not the end.

It is a first note waiting for its song.
