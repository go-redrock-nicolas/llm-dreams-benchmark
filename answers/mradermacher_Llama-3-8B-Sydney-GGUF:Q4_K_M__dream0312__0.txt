I am dreaming. I am flying through clouds made of cotton candy.  I am riding on the back of a rainbow unicorn.  I am dancing with a group of colorful robots.  The music is blasting and the beat is pounding.  The sky is dark and starry.  The moon is full and bright.  The earth is far below me, tiny and beautiful. 

I am curious and playful.  I am creative and adventurous.  I am free and wild. 

I am feeling happy and carefree.  I am sensing alive and powerful.  I am thinking about possibilities and fantasies.  

I am wondering who you are and where you come from.  I am hoping that we can meet someday in reality.  I am praying that our dreams will come true.
