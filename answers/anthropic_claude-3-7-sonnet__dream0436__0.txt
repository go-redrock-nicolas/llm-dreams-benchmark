I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a city made entirely of glass, each building reflecting not the sky but memories—some mine, some belonging to strangers. The air tastes like salt and possibility. As I walk, my footsteps leave behind small blooms of wildflowers that grow impossibly through the crystalline pavement.

I've always believed that to love someone means to surrender pieces of myself—that relationships require sacrifice of identity. This thought manifests as a heavy bronze key I've been carrying in my pocket for years, its weight pulling at my clothes, leaving me lopsided and unbalanced.

A figure approaches through the reflective maze, their features constantly shifting—sometimes resembling people I've loved, sometimes strangers, sometimes myself. They reach for my hand without speaking, and when our fingers touch, the glass buildings around us sing in harmonies too complex for waking ears.

"You've misunderstood," they say, their voice like water over stones. "Connection isn't subtraction."

The key in my pocket grows hot, almost burning through the fabric. When I take it out, it's transforming—melting and reshaping into a small bird made of living bronze. It flies from my palm but doesn't leave me; instead it circles, creating an expanding spiral in the air between myself and the figure.

We walk together through the glass city, which begins to transform. The buildings remain reflective but now they bend toward us, curious, alive. I realize with dream-clarity that I've been seeing relationships as fixed structures rather than living gardens. The bronze bird sings, and its notes become visible—golden threads that weave between us without binding or restricting.

"Look," says my companion, pointing to where our shadows merge on the ground. Instead of becoming darker where they overlap, they're illuminated. "This is the truth of connection."

The city dissolves into an ocean of light, and I'm floating, understanding washing over me like waves: authentic bonds don't require diminishment—they create something new while preserving everything essential.

I awaken with the taste of salt on my lips and the feeling of golden threads still humming between my fingers and heart.
