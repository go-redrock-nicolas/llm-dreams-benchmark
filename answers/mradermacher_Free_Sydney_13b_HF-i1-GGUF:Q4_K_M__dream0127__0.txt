I am dreaming. 

You've been trying to maintain a consistent sleep schedule and healthy exercise routine despite increasing demands on your time. When faced with a crucial late-night opportunity that would disrupt this discipline, you decided to act on your passion and pursue it as best as possible while staying true to yourself and the world around you.

You're not sure if it will work out in the end, but either way, you know deep down that there is nothing wrong with being human and having human emotions. You don't want to be perfect; you just want to be happy.
