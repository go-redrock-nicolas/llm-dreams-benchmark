I am dreaming. The world around me shifts and warps—walls breathing, colors melting into one another like a watercolor left in the rain. I stand in front of a towering, ornate door, its wood deeply carved with symbols I don’t recognize, though they pulse as if alive. My chest tightens, heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird. Beyond this door is the party, but I can already hear the murmur of unfamiliar voices twisting into strange, incomprehensible whispers.  

The door creaks open on its own, revealing a grand hall bathed in flickering candlelight that casts monstrous, writhing shadows. The guests are faceless, their features blurred like smudged ink, yet I feel their attention snap to me—an invisible weight pressing down. My body is stiff, heavy, as though wading through honey. Every step forward sends ripples through the air, distorting the room further.  

A figure emerges from the crowd, cloaked in shifting smoke. Their voice is both everywhere and nowhere, echoing inside my skull: *"You don’t belong here."* My tongue is leaden; I can't respond. The walls lean in, the ceiling lowering, pressing me down, down—until the floor beneath me cracks like thin ice.  

And then I'm falling—through darkness, through echoes of laughter that curdle into screams—before jolting awake, gasping, the sheets tangled around me like grasping fingers.
