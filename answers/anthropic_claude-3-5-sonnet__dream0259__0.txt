I am dreaming. The world around me warps and shifts like watercolors bleeding into each other. I'm standing in what seems to be my childhood home, but the walls breathe and pulse with an otherworldly rhythm. Before me stands someone I deeply care for – their features are somehow both crystal clear and impossibly fluid, changing with each blink of my eyes. But those eyes... their eyes remain constant, pools of hurt that pierce straight through me.

The guilt crashes over me in waves of physical sensation – it feels like molten lead flowing through my veins, weighing down my limbs until I can barely stand. Each breath becomes labored as their pain reflects back at me, multiplying and intensifying. I try to reach out, to apologize, but my words transform into dark butterflies that crumble to ash before reaching them.

The room begins to tilt and stretch, the ceiling extending infinitely upward while the floors ripple like disturbed water. Family photos on the walls begin to weep, their tears creating rivers that flow upward, defying gravity. The person I've hurt starts to fade away, becoming translucent, and panic grips my chest like an icy hand.

I desperately want to make things right, but time begins moving backward – I can see the hurt I caused playing out in reverse, like a film reel spinning the wrong way, yet I'm powerless to change any of it. The guilt metamorphoses into a physical entity, a shadow that wraps around me like a cocoon, whispering all my fears and regrets in voices that sound like breaking glass.

The dream crescendos into a symphony of emotion – regret, love, fear, and hope all tangled together in an impossible knot. The walls continue their breathing, faster now, matching my racing heartbeat, as reality bends and fractures around the weight of my remorse...
