I am dreaming. I sit at my desk bathed in the blue glow of my computer screen, a half-written report glaring back at me. The words blur and swim—I can't focus. My thoughts keep circling back to *that* conversation, the unfinished one, the one that hangs in the air like a knife suspended mid-fall.  

Then the room *changes*. The walls peel away like wet paper, revealing a sprawling midnight forest. My desk is now a moss-covered stone, my keyboard a cluster of bioluminescent mushrooms pulsing gently. The air hums with unseen energy, thick with the scent of damp earth and something metallic—like rust, or old coins.  

A path unfurls before me, glowing faintly silver, winding between black-barked trees that whisper as I pass. Then I see *them*—shadowy figures just beyond the tree line, moving in sync with me. Some take the shape of people I know, their faces flickering like poorly tuned television static. One lingers longer than the others: a silhouette with eyes like smoldering cinders. It doesn’t speak, but I *feel* its question: *Why did you leave it unsaid?*  

The ground beneath me softens. I look down—my feet are sinking into the earth, not sinking, but *merging*, roots curling up around my ankles, anchoring me. The report I was writing flutters down from nowhere, now a scroll covered in symbols I can’t read. The wind snatches it away before I can try.  

A voice, maybe my own, maybe the forest’s, murmurs: *You carry it everywhere. Why not lay it down?*  

I wake with a gasp. My hands are clenched, my sheets tangled. Outside my window, dawn is a faint bruise on the sky. The dream clings to me—those eyes, those roots, that *unfinishedness*. I exhale, slow. Maybe today, I’ll find the words.
