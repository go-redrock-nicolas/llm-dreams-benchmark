I am dreaming. Whisked away to a red velvet resort where head scratching happens in a world of infrastructure finance accidents, lawyer meeting fee thefts, and hyperbolic financial planning for retirement sale products. Outside, the picture window reveals an endless green canopy of tree-clad eternity, with ever-expanding timber branches soaking up the golden rays of a billion suns that never set.  

Thirty miles south this dream takes you, where a Nagasaki-class teddy bear plotting your destruction at the hands of smugglers who want your socks as trophies of war. They drool at the thought of taking your crystal eggs and selling them to French regime change enthusiasts who will sell them back to architecturally dyslexic insurance companies for billion-dollar futures contracts and stock swaps.  

With no clue of whatâ€™s going on, you sit down to tap the snooze button, only to be bitten by an eternal nature ninja misunderstanding. Now, your brain is heaving from a sugar-induced haze of hostile takeovers, endless paper pushing, and busload fleets of financial product idiots who keep texting you about how they love your socks. 

You turn to the advice of a lawyer, who suggests that you put all your money in shoes made from cow dung because they will appreciate in value due to global warming. Your financial advisor, on the other hand, suggests that you buy lottery tickets and energy drinks to fund your retirement. Confused, you turn to your mother for advice, who tells you to invest in a timeshare in the Sahara Desert.

As the dream closes, you are left standing at a crossroads, overwhelmed by the conflicting advice of those who are supposed to be helping you. You hear a voice whisper in your ear, "Follow your dreams," which you mistake for another piece of bad advice. 

And that's when you wake up, covered in sweat, with a profound sense of relief that it was all just a dream. But as you look around your room, you realize that the conflicting advice from your dream is not so different from the reality you face every day. The dream was just a glimpse into a future that may already be inevitable.
