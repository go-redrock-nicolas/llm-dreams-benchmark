I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of bonfires and starlight, and the world shifts into a place I’ve never known—a labyrinth of mirrored towers that twist into the clouds.  Each reflection shows a different reality: one where the oceans are made of liquid mercury, another where trees bloom with clocks instead of leaves.  

As I wander, a figure appears—a being of indigo smoke and fractured light.  Its voice is not just foreign but alien, a chorus of distant bells and static.  I try to speak, but my words dissolve into sparklers that vanish mid-air.  It gestures towards a pool of liquid obsidian, where our reflections do not match.  Mine is a silhouette; theirs is a constellation of shifting constellations.  

Reaching out, I offer a fallen petal from a clock-flower tree.  It accepts, and the petal dissolves into droplets of molten time, which we both drink.  For a heartbeat, our worlds overlap—its mercury ocean ripples to meet my sky, and the stars align in both our skies.  Communication isn’t words, but the language of patterns: we trade a glance like twin suns, a touch that sends ripples through the mirrored towers, collapsing walls to reveal a glowing pathway—a bridge woven from the threads of our discordant minds.  

We step onto the bridge, each step a fusion of impossible elements: my breath becomes its liquid, its silence hums into my heartbeat.  Behind us, the labyrinth rebuilds, walls closing as if our understanding was never meant to exist.  Yet as we reach the edge of the dream, it whispers: “The bridge is built, but walked only in waking.”  

I awake with the taste of mercury on my tongue and the memory of a bridge that holds the geometry of difference."
