I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a sprawling, iridescent forest where the trees shimmer like liquid opal under the light of three moons. The air hums with a low, electrifying frequency, and the ground beneath my feet pulses faintly, as though the earth itself is breathing. Suddenly, I notice a glint of metal half-buried in the soilâ€”a pocket watch with gears made of obsidian and silver. When I lift it, the trees around me shift, forming a path that winds through the luminous undergrowth. Following the path, I come across a crystalline clearing where a marble archway floats in midair. Etched into the arch are intricate mathematical equations and musical notations that seem to vibrate. At the center of the clearing is a pool of mercury-like liquid, its surface reflecting strange constellations. When I dip my hand in, the liquid hardens into a key shaped like a fractal helix. But I realize that the equations on the archway are part of an unsolved theorem about the relationship between quantum entanglement and cosmic soundwaves... And now I must figure out how to prove it before the arch collapses at dawn.
