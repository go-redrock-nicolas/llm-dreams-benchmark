I am dreaming. The air is thick with the crackle of desperation, a dry and electric atmosphere that hums beneath the vaulted sky. Towers of ash-colored glass reach like broken spires into a bruised horizon, where the sun pulses sickly through smog and smoke. The world as it once was is gone — devoured by hunger, by fire, by the long nights of overreach and collapse.

I stand atop a citadel built on the bones of a forgotten metropolis. Generators whir and glow with a phosphorescent blue, casting jagged shadows across the observation deck. Screens blink with fractal patterns and maps flickering crimson in the regions where life still struggles to beat. There is no time left between alarms — only the ticking clock of civilization’s last breath — and I am the last decider.

The Crisis Council surrounds me like statues pulled into life. Each one a lighthouse of knowledge or strategy, but even they are dimming under the weight of too few answers and too many questions.

There’s no clean water anymore, only what we can refine, and that’s run by the factions in the North. The electromagnetic storms severed power grids across three continents; only scattered enclaves believe in light anymore. Farmland lies scorched, resurrected only in vertical glasseries soaring from the ruins of London, harvested under lab-grown suns.

Every hour, the dead mount. Every decision is a scalpel — cut this city to save another, ration this breath to delay that collapse. No comfort comes without theft — of time, of hope.

And yet the dream is beautiful.

Floating gardens sway between the spires on invisible thermal tides, grown in broken skyscrapers and tended by children with eyes like galaxies. Music drifts up from underground refuges, constructed from old subway systems and sung in voices that remember rain. People gather beneath artificial stars, sharing what little they have, their laughter like rebellions against silence.

I am not divine in this role. Far from it. I wear a coat stitched from a hundred refugee blankets. I have not slept in six days. But I remember the code to reactivate the old weather satellites, to trace rain clouds like ghosts across the skin of the earth.

I dream of guiding ark ships out of rusting spaceports, their hulls patched but flight-bound, carrying the seeds of a species that might remember -- someday -- how to be more than survival.

And in that fleeting moment between orders, I feel it: the pulse of something greater beneath the disaster, a raw and radiant truth — that even at the end of the old world, the new one begins in the eyes of those who dare to keep choosing, daring, dreaming.

And so I breathe smoke and steel, and decide again.
