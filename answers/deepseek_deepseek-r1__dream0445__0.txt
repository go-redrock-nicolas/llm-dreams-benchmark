I am dreaming. In this dream, the sky is not a sky but a rippling shroud of indigo velvet, embroidered with constellations that pulse like living fireflies. You stand in a meadow where the grass shimmers like liquid emerald, each blade whispering secrets in a language older than time. Before you, a mirrored labyrinth stretches endlessly, its walls shifting like mercury, reflecting fractured versions of yourself—each reflection clutching a mask. Some masks gleam with gold and jewels (the compliments you’ve shrugged off), while others are cracked and heavy, etched with the harsh words you’ve internalized (the criticisms you’ve welded to your bones).

A shadowy figure emerges, part-specter, part-muse, its voice the hum of a distant storm. *"Why do you bury the gold and wear the cracks?"* it asks, plucking a diamond-studded mask from a reflection. The moment you reach for it, the gems dissolve into smoke, and the mask morphs into a moth-eaten cloth. "Nothing fits when you see yourself sideways," it sighs, gesturing to the labyrinth’s heart, where a tree festers—roots choked with tarnished praise, branches sagging under the weight of scorn.

Suddenly, your hands ignite with silver flame. Where the fire touches the mirrors, they melt into pools, merging your fragmented selves into a river of quicksilver. The tree erupts into blossoms of light, petals singing, *"You are not a ledger of flaws or trophies."* When you wake, the dream lingers like the smell of rain—and your palm still feels warm.
