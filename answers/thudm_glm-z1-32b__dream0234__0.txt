I am dreaming. As I lie in my bed, the velvet darkness of the night wraps around me like a cocoon. A soft, green glow envelops my room, and I realize with wonder that the glow is coming from the plants around me. My potted fern gently ripples its fronds, and a low, melodious hum fills the air. My mouth falls open as I understand the words vibrating through the air: "Welcome, wanderer of the waking world." The air hums with approval as if there is a collective consciousness among the flora in my room. Each plant has a personality—my succulent is mischievous, cracking jokes in a language that feels like sunlit laughter, while my bonsai tree is wise, speaking in the slow, patient cadence of an autumn wind. My mind opens to comprehend their thoughts in a way that feels like translating old, weathered manuscripts into modern poetry.

As I step outside, the entire world transforms. Trees that were once silent now murmur secrets in the wind. Flowers whisper of the future, and vines coil around my ankles, offering guidance. The forest breathes, each leaf a lung expanding with dawn. I communicate with the ancient oak, whose wisdom spans centuries. It tells me of floods that shaped the land and stars that aligned on the night I was born. The grass beneath me sings a lullaby as I lay down, and the night sky becomes a living tapestry where constellations murmur in ancient tongues. I float among them, weightless, realizing that the earth is a living entity, humming with life I never knew existed. My consciousness merges with the plants, and I feel the pulse of the planet itself. As I wake, the first rays of sun filter through my window, and though the waking world is silent, I hear the echo of the oak's voice in my mind: “Remember, the earth remembers you too.” I keep this secret close, feeling a profound connection to the world that was always there, waiting for someone to listen.
