I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself walking down a busy city street during a relentless downpour. The rain comes down in sheets, obscuring the world beyond a few feet in front of me. The sound of rushing water fills the air, and the smell of damp asphalt hangs heavily in the atmosphere.

As I hurry along, I notice a homeless man huddled under a small awning, his clothes soaked through and his hands wrapped in torn, frayed fabric. The despair in his eyes is evident, a stark contrast to the tired determination in his voice as he calls out to me.

"Excuse me, sir," he says with a tremor in his voice, "Could you help me? I'm out of food, and I'm freezing."

Behind him, I see others rushing past, their umbrellas held high, refusing to make eye contact, their strides a bit faster. The choice is mine to make.

Do I rush past, continuing my journey, or do I stop and help this man, offering whatever I can? The choice is mine, but in this moment, the rain intensifies, pressing down on both of us, and I see the man's need more clearly.

In this instant, I am compelled to act. I take off my coat and wrap it around him, handing him a small package of food I happen to have in my bag. His eyes widen in surprise, a tear slipping down his cheek as he mutters a quiet thank you.

Even in the middle of the storm, I feel a small warmth inside, knowing I have made a difference.
