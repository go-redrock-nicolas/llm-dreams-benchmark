I am dreaming. I stand before a massive oak desk where my mentor sits, silver-haired and sharp-eyed, holding my manuscript in hands that have shaped careers for decades. The pages—my heart's work for three years—are riddled with red marks that seem to pulsate in the warm light of the book-lined office.

"The foundation is there," she says, her voice like autumn leaves, "but you've built a house of cards on it."

Her words pierce through me. The room begins to subtly distort—the bookshelves stretching taller, the ceiling receding into darkness. I feel the floor beneath me becoming less solid, as though my very footing in this world depends on her approval.

"You wrote safely," she continues, "when you should have bled onto these pages."

My throat tightens. The manuscript in her hands begins to weep actual ink, black teardrops falling onto her immaculate desk. I try to speak but find my voice has retreated somewhere unreachable.

Suddenly, the red marks crawl off the pages like tiny scarlet insects, marching up my arms, inscribing their criticisms directly onto my skin. They burn slightly, these tattoos of inadequacy.

Yet as they sink deeper, something unexpected happens. Each mark transforms into a small lantern beneath my skin, illuminating pathways I hadn't seen before. The pain transforms into clarity.

I realize I'm not drowning in her criticism—I'm being offered a map through uncharted waters.

The room stops distorting and instead fills with a gentle blue light. My mentor's face softens, and when she hands the manuscript back, it has become a small sapling, roots dangling, ready for stronger soil.

"This isn't rejection," the dream-logic tells me. "This is invitation."

I take the living manuscript in trembling hands and feel my confidence not shattered but rather reformed—like clay thrown back to the wheel for a more honest shape.
