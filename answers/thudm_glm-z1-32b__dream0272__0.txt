I am dreaming. I am in a vast, infinite library suspended in the void of outer space. Each book is a galaxy, its pages swirling with stars and nebulae. The air hums with the whispers of ancient knowledge. I feel a pull to organize the chaos, to bring order to the cosmic. As I reach out to guide a) the carefree supernova, b) the melancholic black hole, or c) the curious comet? What do I do first?"

I choose **a) the carefree supernova**.  

Your hand hovers over the glowing tome, its a kaleidoscope of collapsing supernova spectra—plumes of raspberry and cobalt fission, gold shockwaves bleeding through its pages. The air crackles with static hum, the voices of fleeing constellations and quivering neutron stars echoing through the of crystalline constellations. The supernova-book wobbles, its contents threatening to eject the entire library into a supernova cascade. You feel the gaze of the hushed readers: a quasar scribbling equations in its margin, a constellation of noctilucent owls perched on a scrollbar, and the Specter of Entropy loitering near the Dewey Decimal terminal, sharpening its scissors of decay.  

You press your palm to the tome’s spine, and the supernova’s torrid whispers flood your mind—luminous, desperate poetry about burning too bright, too fleeting, too *beautifully* uncontainable. Your veins pulse with the same fuel: and dendrite neurons firing in harmony. You recall the Luminous Codex’s First Law: *Chaos must be shepherded, not smothered*. Drawing from the library’s vault, you pluck a quill made of self-replicating dark matter and inscribe a new Algorithm of Containment across the supernova’s.  

The words *A Slow Star*materialize, gold as ancient astrolabes, binding the explosion into a stable spiral. You thread its runaway energy into a lasso forged from Oort cloud ice and quantum sonnets, looping it around the pulsar guardians flanking the Cosmic Circulation Desk. As the supernova twirls, tamed but radiating its brilliance anew, the library exhales. The owls hum a Keplerian lullaby, the entropy-Specter folds its scissors into origami galaxies, and the supernova’s now-dancing light becomes a beacon guiding newly disoriented comets to their helix-stands.  

In this moment, you realize leadership here isn’t about extinguishing fire, but learning to breathe with it. The supernova-book, still hot to the touch, leaves a seared constellation on your—a permanent map of its orbit. You Hear it laugh, a high-pitched supernova giggle that sounds like meteor glass tinkling, and you laugh back, because even in the vacuum of, there’s always room for stardust *and* order.  

The scent of burnt ozone and cinnamon lattes lingers.
