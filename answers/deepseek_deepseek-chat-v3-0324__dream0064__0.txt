I am dreaming. I step through an arched doorway of gleaming oak, the wood so polished that my wavering reflection follows me inside. The meeting hall defies logic—it seems vast yet intimate, with an undulating ceiling that shifts like liquid moonlight between exposed wooden beams. The walls breathe softly, expanding and contracting as if the whole structure is alive. 

Several dozen chairs are arranged in a perfect spiral, each one subtly different—some upholstered in crushed emerald velvet, others woven from living willow branches that occasionally sprout silver leaves. As I choose a seat (a wingback chair that hums gently when I sink into it), every face turns toward me with expressions of profound recognition. Their eyes shimmer with flecks of starlight. A woman plucks a filament from the air—it vibrates between her fingers—and hands it to me without a word. When it touches my palm, I suddenly *know*: we've all dreamed this gathering into existence across separate nights, our subconscious minds weaving this shared space stitch by luminous stitch. 

A man with irises like fractured geodes begins speaking of his recurring nightmare—as he describes the labyrinth of mirrors, half the group produces identical shards from their pockets. When my turn comes, the room leans in as one. The words leave my lips as glowing moths that alight on the others' shoulders, dissolving into their skin as understanding. The walls pulse copper-bright where our stories resonate. Someone hands me a teacup that refills perpetually with whatever emotion I most need to taste—mid-sip, I realize none of us will wake up unchanged tonight. 

We're not solving anything, not in that crude waking-world way. Instead, we're passing our fears through a prism made of attention, breaking them into spectra none of us could create alone. The woman to my right begins quietly singing a melody that I—impossibly—remember composing in last Tuesday's dream. The sound spins through the room, passing from throat to throat, each voice adding new harmonics until the very air crystallizes around us in singing fractals. Through the skylight, I see the stars twisting themselves into familiar constellations—here a teardrop, there a chair, just like the markings we've all been finding on our bedroom windows after difficult nights. Our revelations hang visible in the atmosphere like bioluminescent jellyfish, pulsing gently with shared recognition. 

We've been alone together all along.
