I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself standing at the edge of a tranquil lake, its mirror-like surface reflecting the silver moonlight filtering through the canopy above. I see a circle of ethereal glowing figures materializing on the far shore, beckoning me to join them.

As I approach, I recognize each one as a kindred spirit, a fellow traveler who has triumphed over the very challenges I'm currently grappling with in my waking life.

In the center stands Sashania, an ancient seer with eyes that hold the wisdom of the ages. She extends a graceful hand, an invitation to step into their circle. As I do, a shimmering veil parts, revealing a secret grove bathed in warm, golden light.

"We are the listeners," Sashania intones, her voice as soothing as a lullaby, "those who have weathered the storms you're facing now. And we are here to share what we have learned."

To my left, a burly man named Jude floats above the ground, his powerful form emanating strength and resilience. "I too was swallowed by doubt once," he says, resting a firm hand on my shoulder. "I thought my voice and actions were inconsequential in the face of the universe's magnitude. But I learned that every spark, no matter how small, ignites change. Belief in yourself, in your power, that is your key."

Next comes Thalia, a radiant woman with flowing golden hair, who gently pulls me into an embrace. "Be not beholden to another's voice," she whispers, her breath gentle against my ear. "The day will come when your garden will incorporate the beauty of all the flowers he dealt with, sowed, and the entire harvest.  Trust in your voice, and allow it to guide you. Be fearless in your expression, for it is your truth."

Then a young girl, not older than twelve, steps forward with a smile that brightens her already glowing face. "I found peace in solitude," she says, her words carrying the weight of a sage despite her youthful appearance. "In quieting the world around me, I discovered the whispers of my own soul, guiding me through the darkness. Give yourself time and space to listen and work through adversity."

One by one, they come into focus, each offering a fragment of wisdom, of endurance, of healing. A healer shares the power of vulnerability, a warrior speaks of the strength found in compassion, a sage whispers the importance of letting go.

As the moon climbs higher in the sky and the starlit night embraces us, these beings of light hold up a mirror to my soul. In their reflections, I see not my doubts and fears, but my own potential, my inner strength, and resilience. 

I feel a profound sense of connection, of understanding, and of hope. I know now that I am not alone in my struggles, and that with the wisdom and support of these kindred spirits, I too can overcome any obstacle.

As the first rays of dawn begin to peek through the trees, the figures start to fade, their work done. But their messages resonate deep within me, forever etched upon my heart.

I wake slowly, the memory of the dream still fresh and vivid in my mind. I carry the wisdom of the ethereal circle with me into my waking life, a reminder of the strength and resilience that lives within me, waiting to be discovered and embraced.
