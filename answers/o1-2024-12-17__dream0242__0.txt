I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, domed control room, its sweeping walls curving upward like the inside of a colossal shell, reflecting eerie fluorescent lights. The air crackles with tension and static. Wide, curving glass windows overlook the core of the nuclear facility far below—an elegant labyrinth of coolant pipes, endless kilometers of cables, and a glimmering metal dome that houses the reactor. My body feels weightless, almost as if I’m floating, but a pounding terror in my chest reminds me that this is all too real.

Screens line the walls in every direction, flickering urgent reds and feverish oranges. An orchestra of alarms and mechanical clatters assaults my senses. I hover over a massive steel console, covered with old-fashioned toggle switches, blinking LEDs, and digital readouts that stutter with incomprehensible data. Every readout screams the same jarring message: the reactor’s temperature is breaking thresholds, unstoppable, unstoppable. The system is suffering one failure after another, a domino line of meltdown warnings sending my heartbeat into overdrive.

On my right, I see pale-faced technicians glancing at each other in silent horror, the color draining from their cheeks as siren lights bathe their faces in lurid flashes. Each tries to remain calm, flipping emergency switches only to watch them fail with a dull, echoing thunk. Sparks flare from overhead wiring. A wisp of smoke drifts by. It gives off a noxious smell of ozone and fear, which only intensifies the sense of claustrophobia gripping me. I can hear the frantic rasp in my own breathing.

Beneath the towering windows, the reactor’s coolant tanks are sloshing about in visible agitation. The once-controlled turquoise-blue glow has shifted to a sickly greenish hue. The meltdown warnings intensify, a trembling rumble skittering through the floors up to my bones, like a beast awakening in the belly of the complex. Suddenly, a sharp crack splits the air as a housing pipe bursts somewhere below. The temperature on the console leaps into the red. We’re one microsecond from a chain reaction that every fail-safe was meant to prevent.

Desperately, I race around the room, scanning for the final override measure, that last resort locked behind layers of safety codes. My fingertips brush across a glass panel, forcibly sealed under a red lever. I can see my reflection in the polished surface: eyes wide, drenched in sweat, hair plastered to my forehead. The edges of my vision flicker with swirling shadows. I wrench the lever downward and the glass shatters with a sharp crash, sending shards spinning. Red words flood the screen: “Manual Control Authorized.” Yet the computer sputters, reluctant to obey. Electricity arcs overhead, dancing like ghostly snakes.

In the corner of my eye, the reactor dome itself warps, pulsing as if drawing breath. Every fiber of my being screams to contain the uncontainable, to quell the unstoppable energy about to burst in cataclysmic fury. Alarms loop in an endless wail—like the howl of some mechanical banshee. My mind floods with images: blazing mushroom clouds, scorched landscapes, echoes of devastation. I slam buttons, pull levers, and shout commands, my voice lost in the cacophony. The metal beneath my feet roils like the deck of a feverish ship.

In that moment, a second hush seems to swallow the chaos. For a single heartbeat, time suspends. I sense the heart of the reactor, an eternity of raw nuclear force, and I watch it expanding in my mind’s eye, unstoppable as a dying star. The final meltdown sequence is engaged; all I can do is brace myself as swirling flames and scorching air course through the corridor, an infernal gale. Darkness rushes in, pressing against the edges of my consciousness. And just as the blazing white light reaches me—enveloping every nerve in my body—I awaken with a gasp, drenched in sweat, the echoes of alarms still ringing in my ears.
