I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the grand auditorium of a magnificent, gilded Art Nouveau theater. The air hums with an expectant buzz as the sea of theater-goers rustles in their velvet seats. approche de l'apothéose, whispers theProgramne handed out at the entrance. I am on stage, bathed in the soft glow of an , a spotlight that warms my face and casts dancing shadows on the plush crimson curtains behind me.

It is my friend, Alex, who stands before me, dressed in a crisp suit that glistens under the stage lights. They clutch a fragile, golden statuette in their hand, a replica of the graceful dancers carved into the balcony railings above us. The audience applauds, a thunderous wave of appreciation that seems to shake the very foundations of the theater. Alex's eyes are misty with gratitude, their smile wide and genuine. They say, "Enormous thanks to my partner, whose relentless creativity and dedication made this masterpiece possible. I could not have done it without you." Yet, the whole room seems to have gone deaf, for not a single pair of eyes turns towards me.

I look around, my heart pounding like a distant drum. My eyes meet the gaze of other patrons, strangers whose faces are bathed in the same golden light. They smile at me, nodding their heads in silent greeting, but no words of recognition escape their lips. I feel a strange mixture of pride and disappointment, like the sweet and sour notes of a complicated symphony dancing on my tongue. I am thrilled to see Alex basking in the well-deserved glory, yet I cannot help but feel a pang of injustice at the silence surrounding me.

As Alex descends the stage in a flurry of congratulations, I notice something peculiar. My hands, which have been clutching the hem of myählen shirt anxiously, start to emit a soft, ethereal glow. The light grows brighter with each passing moment, until it seems to envelop my entire body. The room falls silent as one, all eyes now fixed upon me. I can feel the weight of their gazes, not with judgment or reproach, but with a profound understanding that transcends words.

Suddenly, the theater fills with an otherworldly music, a harmonious blend of harps and voices that seems to resonate within my very soul. I rise into the air, my feet leaving the stage as if drawn by an unseen force. As I hover above the audience, I see that their eyes are no longer focused on me, but on the intricate patterns of light dancing in the air around my hands. They are no longer looking at the uncredited contributor, but at the art that flows from my fingertips like a river of liquid gold.

In that moment, I understand that recognition is not a fleeting snapshot, but a symphony that echoes through time. While Alex may have been the one to take the bow and receive the accolades, the true essence of creation has always been ours to share. As I gaze out at the enraptured faces below, I feel a surge of pride and gratitude, knowing that my contribution has left its mark, whether credited or not. And with that realization, I wake up, my heart brimming with warmth and contentment, ready to face the day and continue my creative journey.
