I am dreaming. The world outside my window is a swirl of muted colors, like watercolors left to dry on paper.  The sky stretches endlessly above, a tapestry of indigo and peach, bleeding into each other in abstract patterns.  A soft, persistent hum vibrates in the air, like the drone of a distant organ.  

I find myself standing in a vast, echoing corridor. My footsteps do not echo.  The walls are made of some translucent mineral, the interior glowing faintly with arrays of colored light—shades I’ve never seen in waking life.  A figure steps out of the shadows, cloaked in a robe that seems too alive, tendrils flaring like coral under moonlight.  

“You have to trust the whispers,” it says, its voice like wind chimes shaken in a storm. “They know the way the labyrinth breathes.”  

But I shake my head. My own intuition whispers back, a voice that sounds eerily like my childhood self: “No. The labyrinth is a trap. The whispers lead to the swallowing vine.”  

The corridor begins to shift. The walls peel away like scales, and I’m falling, not down, but sideways into a world of liquid light.  

In this new realm, I’m confronted by a fork in the path. To the left, a bridge of spider silk spans a chasm, swaying gently against a wind that doesn’t exist. To the right, a staircase of obsidian spirals upward into a bruised violet sky, each step etched with constellations that rearrange themselves at a glance.  

The left path speaks to me of precision and patience. The right, of ambition and recklessness.  
But then I recall the advice. The whispers say left. My gut says right.  
The ground beneath my feet begins to dissolve. I take a step onto the spider silk bridge...  
And wake up with a gasp, my sheets tangled around me like the tendrils of that vine.
