I am dreaming. …stop shouting and take a breath.  

The moment you inhale, the room around you peels away like the page of a book, and suddenly you and your friend are no longer in the cramped apartment where the fight began. Instead, you’re standing on a narrow suspension bridge spun entirely from shimmering threads of silver harp-string. It stretches across a canyon so deep that the floor of it is hidden under curling violet mist. Every tremor of your voices sends a soft musical hum rippling through the cables, as though the bridge itself is eavesdropping on the quarrel.

“What if we’re both wrong?” you hear yourself say—and the sentence hangs in the air like a glass ornament, fragile, reflecting everything.

Your friend narrows their eyes, but instead of firing back, they reach into their pocket and pull out the object at the center of your dispute: a tiny brass compass whose needle refuses to point north. It spins, restless and unpredictable, as though magnetized by emotion rather than geography. You’ve argued for days—weeks?—about where it should guide you. You swore it was meant for true adventurers; they insisted it was a trinket, a trap, a dream’s dead end.

You decide, together, to test it once and for all.

Side by side, you each press a finger to the glass face. The needle jerks, vibrates, and steadies—aiming straight down. Instantly, the bridge dissolves beneath your feet.

Gravity never arrives. Instead, you float through pockets of warm, glowing air like autumn leaves caught in a gentle updraft. A thousand iridescent bubbles drift around you, each holding a miniature scene: city streets paved in piano keys; a forest of candelabras sprouting from moss; an ocean of spilled ink that ripples with stories. Every bubble hums with the melody from the vanished bridge. You realize these are all the paths the compass might have taken you, had you chosen differently.

You and your friend glance at each other—argument forgotten for the moment—then touch one of the larger bubbles together. It bursts in a harmless spray of sparks, and the two of you tumble onto a moonlit desert made of golden clock-gears. Every step chimes and clicks; every dune rearranges itself in spirals of ticking brass. The sky overhead is a parchment map, constellations sketched in swirling black ink that periodically drips downward, blotting the sand and forming new clock faces.

Here, the disagreement flares again: you claim the map is rewriting itself because you stood up for the compass’s magic; your friend insists it’s rewriting because you refused to listen. Your words raise a sandstorm of whirling cogs, spinning so fast that they blur into discs of liquid time. Wind howls through the gear-teeth, echoing your harshest accusations back at you in a mechanical chorus. The storm swallows your friend from view—and panic scalds your throat.

You reach for them and grasp thin air.

The compass, still in your hand, pulses like a frantic heartbeat. Instinctively, you calm your breathing until its rhythm matches yours. The needle flickers, then glows ember-red, pointing past the storm. You follow it, wading through dunes that clang like bells with every stride, calling your friend’s name. Each syllable leaves your mouth as a ribbon of silver light, slicing gaps in the swirling sand. At last, you see their silhouette, curled beneath an over-turned gear the size of a small planet.

They look up—eyes wide, face streaked in powdered brass—and you see the same fear that shakes your own core: the terror of losing each other over pride. You kneel, extend the compass, and for the first time truly offer it, palm open. No speeches, no conditions. Just a request: Choose with me.

Your friend’s shoulders release their tension, as though gears inside them have finally found alignment. They place their hand over yours; your combined warmth heats the brass until it shines like molten sunrise. The needle lifts off its pivot, floating between glass and metal, and transforms into a slender arrow made of hummingbird feathers and starlight. It pierces the desert floor, and a crack zigzags outward, shedding cogs and revealing rich black soil beneath.

From that soil erupts a single verdant vine. It spirals upward and unfurls leaves shaped like pages of an unread book. Blossoms bloom—each flower a different hue of your shared memories: laughter-yellow, apology-blue, promise-green. The vine twines around the two of you, gentle but inescapable, and lifts you toward the parchment sky. As it rises, it stitches the split between torn constellations, mending the map until it glows whole and warm.

Higher still, you break through the paper heavens and float into a realm of soft twilight. Giant lanterns, fashioned from fireflies imprisoned inside crystalline globes, drift in slow waltzes. Across an endless velvet canopy, two shimmering comets cross paths, weaving a luminous X. It’s the universe’s subtle signature: you are here, together, and that is enough.

With a final sigh, the vine sets you down on a balcony of carved moonstone overlooking a tranquil lake of liquid mercury. The surface reflects not just your bodies, but your whole history—shared triumphs, petty arguments, secret worries—playing like ripples of silver film. You both watch in silence. Neither needs to speak. The argument was real, the hurt was real, but here in the hush of this impossible place, you understand that the friendship itself is a compass, its needle forever circling back to forgiveness.

As dawn—striped in peach, rose, and indigo—rises over the mercury water, you feel the dream starting to loosen its grip. You clasp your friend’s hand one last time, and together you drop the brass compass into the lake. Instead of sinking, it blossoms into a white lotus, luminous and serene. Petals open, revealing its center: an empty spindle where the needle used to be.

Because, perhaps, you no longer need it.

A breeze lifts, scented with memory, and the scene dissolves into soft, swirling light. Your friend’s face fades last, wearing a brave, hopeful smile. The final sound is the distant chiming of harp-strings—one last echo from the bridge where it all began—before you drift up through layers of color, warmth, and gentle nothingness …

… and then awaken, heart calmer, mind clearer, a single quiet thought blooming in the afterglow:  

In every fight worth having, the compass that truly matters points to us.
