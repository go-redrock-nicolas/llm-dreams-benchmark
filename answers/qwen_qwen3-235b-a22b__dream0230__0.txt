I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning lavender, and the sky above you ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting a thousand fractured versions of yourself—each one screaming, laughing, weeping, or silent. You stand at the edge of a vast, inverted forest, where the trees grow downward from a ceiling of smoldering stars, their roots clawing at a ground that pulses like a heartbeat. This is the Labyrinth of the Unspoken, and at its center lies the thing you’ve chased through lifetimes: the **Eclipse Lens**, a shard of primordial glass that can pierce the veil between reality and the raw, writhing truth beneath.  

But the path to it is a gauntlet of mirrors, each one demanding a toll.  

The first mirror swallowed your voice, leaving you to scream soundlessly as your shadow was torn from your body and stitched into a tapestry of forgotten names. The second took your capacity to love, replacing it with a hollow, humming void that aches like a phantom limb. The third demanded your name, and you watched it dissolve into ash as the wind whispered, *“You are no one now.”*  

Now, the final mirror looms—a jagged archway of black ice, its surface swirling with the faces of everyone you’ve ever loved, lost, or betrayed. At its base stands the Guardian, a creature woven from your own memories: a mother’s lullaby, a lover’s last letter, the scent of rain on childhood soil. Its eyes are your own eyes, but older, wearied by choices they’ve never had to make.  

**“To pass,”** the Guardian intones, its voice a chorus of your own regrets, **“you must surrender what you cannot bear to lose. Not a thing, but a truth. A piece of the story you tell yourself to stay human.”**  

You hesitate. Your hands tremble—not from fear, but from the weight of knowing there’s no trick, no loophole. The Eclipse Lens glimmers just beyond the mirror, its light both a promise and a threat. With it, you could unravel the lie of mortality, see the gears behind the cosmos, become something… *other*. But the price is a wound that will never scab.  

The Guardian steps closer, its form flickering. It becomes your younger self, the one who still believed in happy endings. **“Choose,”** it pleads. **“Or turn back. But know this: the longer you wait, the more the world will bleed from your indecision.”**  

You close your eyes.  

When you open them, the mirror shatters.  

The Guardian screams as you rip the memory of their face from your mind—their smile, their voice, the way they held your hand before vanishing. The void rushes in, voracious and cold, devouring every trace of them. The pain is exquisite. It is a symphony.  

You stumble through the archway, the Eclipse Lens now yours. But as you press it to your eye, the world fractures. You see the threads stitching your skin to your bones, the borrowed light in the stars, the silent scream of atoms decaying. It is beautiful. It is unbearable.  

And somewhere, in the hollow where that memory once lived, a single question festers:  

**Was the truth worth the ghost of who you were?**  

The dream ends. You wake up screaming, but no sound comes out.
