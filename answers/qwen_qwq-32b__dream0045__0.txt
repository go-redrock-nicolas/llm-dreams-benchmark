I am dreaming. The air smells damp and metallic, like the inside of a 9-volt battery left out in the rain.  My shoes sink into ash that still hisses with the memory of fire.  The sky above is a bruise-colored canvas, sliced open by jagged lightning.  Far off, the horizon thrums with a low, granitic growl—a sound that rumbles from the earth itself...

Wait, that’s not a dream.  That’s a memory.  

My hands tremble as I reach for a half-melted photograph in the rubble.  A face peers back: my mother, laughing, draped over a picnic blanket.  The paper crackles like dead leaves.  When I try to it, the image dissolves into gray dust.  I cough, the soot sticking to the back of my throat.

"Hello?" My voice comes out as a rasp.  No answer.  Only the caw of a crow, perched atop the twisted spine of the library’s clocktower.  Its beak glints, dripping something black and glittering.  Wait—that's not ink.  It’s tar.  Thick, living tar that writhes like a trapped serpent before plummeting to the ground and pooling around my feet.  

The ground pulses beneath me.  A fissure splits the earth, exhaling smoke that smells of burnt almonds.  Through the haze, figures emerge—ghostly silhouettes with too many joints, their limbs bending at impossible angles.  They mouth words, but their voices are swallowed by the roar of the collapsing sky.  

I run, my legs moving faster than my nightmares, toward the skeleton of what was once a grocery store.  Its shelves are lined with jars filled not with pickles or jam, but with swirling galaxies, each a miniature universe trapped in glass.  A jar cracks nearby, spraying stardust that clings to my skin like a second coat of freckles.  

A hand grabs my shoulder.  I turn—a face made of constellations stares back, eyes like supernovas.  "You can’t outrun the collapse," it sings, its voice a chorus of a thousand hummingbirds.  "The world is unraveling, thread by."  

I wake up.  Or do I?  The walls of my childhood bedroom ripple like water.  My walls... they're alive.  They writhe and bulge, birthmark-like, until a face forms, weeping rivers of tapioca pudding.  "Join us," it slurs.  "Become part of the..."  

The sentence dissolves into a laugh that is all teeth and no sound.  

I'm falling again.  This time, into ink.  The darkness is thick, viscous.  It fills my lungs, each breath a communion with the void.  Above, there’s a light—not the sun, but a thousand muted moons, their glow a cold, radioactive blue.  

I surface, gasping, onto a beach of obsidian shards.  Each black pebble pulses with LEDs, casting fractured neon patterns across the shore.  The tide comes in not with water, but with liquid mirrors, reflecting faces I once knew.  A stranger in the reflection winks.  

Panicking, I scramble upward, only to find myself scaling a cliff of stacked dictionaries.  The pages flap like birds, each word underlined in blood-red pen.  "Ephemeral," "entropy," "eclipse"—the definitions bleed together.  

At the cliff's edge stands a door, ornately carved with scenes of cities being swallowed by roots, oceans freezing mid-wave, mountains crumbling into origami.  The doorknob is a clenched fist made of coral.  I turn it.  

Inside is a library—a library without books.  Only empty shelves where the titles float autonomously, glowing like fireflies.  "Select one," whispers the air.  "Choose the story that unites the collapse and the rebirth."  

The stories swirl, coalescing into a single title: "The Persistence of Light in the Absence of Dawn".  

I reach for it.  

The ground beneath me erupts.  

When my eyes open, I'm back in the ruins, but the air is different.  The crows have become paper birds, flying in perfect formation.  The tar pools now bloom into flowers, their petals iridescent and forever wilting and unblooming.  The ash hisses in a language I almost understand.  

A voice, both mine and not mine, says: "Begin again."  

The world is still falling apart.  But perhaps, in the fracturing, there is a chance to build something stranger, fierier, than before.
