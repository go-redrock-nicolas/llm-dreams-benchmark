I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric anticipation, thick as honey, sweet and charged with possibility. The sky above is a swirling canvas of indigo and gold, streaked with ribbons of liquid starlight that pulse in time with my heartbeat. I stand at the edge of a vast, glassy lake, its surface so still it reflects not just the heavens, but fragments of memories—glimpses of my younger self, wide-eyed and hopeful, whispering promises into the dark.  

The goal I’ve chased for so long shimmers just beyond the water, a radiant, shifting shape—sometimes a door, sometimes a key, sometimes a crown woven from fire and shadow. I can feel its pull in my bones, a magnetic yearning that has guided me through years of struggle, doubt, and fleeting triumphs. Now, it’s close. So close.  

I step onto the lake, and the surface holds me, not like ice, but like a living thing, yielding yet unbreakable. With each step, ripples spread outward, and in their wake, scenes from my journey flicker to life—sleepless nights hunched over books, hands trembling with exhaustion; moments of doubt where the path seemed to vanish entirely; the quiet, stubborn voice inside that always whispered, *Keep going.*  

The air grows warmer as I near the center, where the goal now takes form—a towering tree of silver and emerald, its roots deep in the water, its branches brushing the stars. At its base, a figure waits—my future self, radiant and serene, holding out a single fruit that glows with inner light.  

*"Take it,"* they murmur, though their lips don’t move. *"You’ve always known the way."*  

My fingers stretch toward it—just a breath away—when the dream shudders, the edges blurring. The lake darkens, the sky trembles, and for a heartbeat, I fear I’ll wake before I grasp it. But then—  

My hand closes around the fruit.  

And the world *ignites.*
