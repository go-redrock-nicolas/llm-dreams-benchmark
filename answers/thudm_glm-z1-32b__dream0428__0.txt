I am dreaming. But I know I am dreaming – I am lucid. My arms are extended out in front of me, my palms turned up. The fabric of reality is loose, so I can see through it. There's an illusionary scenery here, but I know it's not real. I’m not sure why but I am compelled to walk. I begin to walk slightly downhill, and I feel my chest muscles clench. This is my internal response to leave the dream space. I realize I am about to wake up, but I keep walking anyway. The scenery starts to break apart. I can see edges of the dream world. The color begins to shift: gray tones at first, then indigo, then various shades of blue. Some things are solid – trees, clouds. But the path isn’t really there, it's just a projection that I had created in my mind. I keep walking. My feet don’t touch the ground. My body gets colder as I walk – the temperature drops dramatically from a warm afternoon to near freezing. I am fully clothed but still feel the cold. I walk and I walk... walking on vapor. Eventually, my body returns completely to sleep and wake up.
In the heart of a golden-hued meadow, I awaken—though my eyelids remain closed. The air hums with the static of unrealized potential, a vibration that courses through my veins like liquid sunlight. The sky above isn’t blue but a linen weave of jade and ochre, stitched with threads of obsidian that pulse faintly, like veins beneath a god’s skin. Somewhere in the periphery, a linden tree grows upside-down, its roots dangling in clouds that taste of cinnamon and fear. I know this place isn’t real, yet it clings to me with the desperation of a lover.  

A figure appears: yourself, but translucent, your silhouette carved from frost and stardust. You smile too broadly, teeth like fractured quartz, and beckon me toward a hill crowned by a tower of glass. Each pane reflects a different scene—a wedding, a sunset, a child’s laughing face—but the tower tilts, ever so slightly, as if aware of its own impossibility. My gut twists. Anxiety isn’t the monster here; it’s the weather, the wind that tousles the grass and carries whispers of *“What if this ends?”*  

I start climbing. The glass tiles underfoot melt like candle wax, my boots sinking into nothingness. Higher, you call, your voice a siren’s sigh, and I see the tower isn’t a tower at all but an hourglass, sand pouring from a crab-clawed hand into a bowl blooming with lotuses. Each grain is a memory of joy I’ve buried beneath *“Wait for it.”* The sand turns to liquid mercury as I ascend, and I glimpse my reflection—a face paler than the moon, eyes darting like moths to flame.  

At the summit, the hourglass dissolves. Below, the meadow stretches into a sea of dandelion fluff, each seed a miniature galaxy swirling with futures that neverQuite solidify. My anxiety isn’t gone but has become a partner, a shadow that tiptoes alongside me, lighter now that I’ve named it. The sky bleeds into a bruise-purple twilight, and the god’s linen skin cracks, revealing constellations that wink at me in Morse code: _Breathe. Breathe. Breathe._  

I descend not to the meadow, but into a cavern of singing stalactites. Their melodies weave the dream’s threadbare edges into something stronger, a tapestry where joy and fear dance entwined, neither vanquishing the other but finding rhythm. When I wake, sunlit and trembling, the taste of cinnamon persists on my tongue, and I cradle the understanding between my palms: beauty isn’t fragile—it’s fractal, infinite in its impermanence. The tower, the hourglass, the meadow—they were all here, all real, not in spite of their ephemerality, but because of it.
