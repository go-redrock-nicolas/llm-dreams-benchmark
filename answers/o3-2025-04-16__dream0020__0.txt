I am dreaming. …find yourself pausing on the threshold, one hand resting on a door that seems to breathe beneath your palm. The reunion is housed inside an old conservatory whose glass panes shimmer like fish scales under moonlight, even though an afternoon sun hangs outside in a lazy cobalt sky. You step forward, and the air changes—suddenly scented with rain-kissed lilac and the faint, coppery tang of nostalgia.

Your shoes clack against a checkerboard floor that stretches farther than physics permits, alternating onyx and ivory squares that sometimes ripple like pond water. A string quartet plays in a far corner, yet the music drifts through walls and passes straight through you, vibrating in your ribs, rewriting your heartbeat into a waltz.

Faces appear: some instantly familiar, others flickering like half-remembered dreams. A childhood friend, Lila, stands near a crystalline punch bowl. Her hair ignites in the sunbeams, curls catching gold sparks, but she keeps her eyes down—those same eyes that once brimmed with hurt when you left an argument unresolved. She raises a delicate glass as though in toast, yet the punch inside has turned into a swirling galaxy, constellations spinning where ice cubes should be.

You sense another presence behind you—Marcus, the friend who ghosted your calls after that final unresolved night. When you turn, time lurches: the guests freeze mid-gesture, suspended like insects in amber. Only Marcus moves. He strides forward, but every step seems to skip frames, as though he’s both approaching and retreating at once. His expression is equal parts apology and challenge.

Before either of you can speak, the room sighs. Vines snake down from the rafters, bearing blossoms that open with gentle pops, releasing memories instead of pollen. One flower unfurls above your head, and a memory drips out in liquid light: the two of you laughing beside an old arcade cabinet, your breath fogging the glass, tickets spilling like confetti. The floor beneath your feet tilts, reflecting the memory on its polished surface, daring you to step inside.

You do. You and Marcus tumble into that glowing drop of the past and land on a neon-lit boardwalk at dusk. Seagulls caw overhead, yet their voices are pitched like woodwinds. Carnivalesque lights sputter alive. You remember the endings you never allowed: the apology unsaid, the explanation unheard. Here, in this dream facsimile, you both have a second try. You turn, find Marcus’s gaze gleaming with saltwater and regret.

“I wasn’t ready to listen,” he says, voice echoing with a reverb of surf. “And I wasn’t brave enough to speak,” you answer. The words float between you, glowing as runes, then dissolve into harmless sparks. The moment hums with closure; tides retreat, leaving a polished shore.

Instantly the boardwalk folds itself into a paper crane, carrying you both back to the conservatory. Time jolts forward; guests regain motion. Lila steps up, tension softening. You touch her shoulder, and the galaxy punch inside her glass resolves into clear water. She smiles—something unclenches between you. The checkerboard floor smooths into a single slab of moonstone, and lion-shaped sconces purr contentedly.

One by one, unresolved strands weave into gentle fabric: a forgotten mentor places a hand on your back, granting approval you always sought; an estranged cousin offers a shy grin, her freckles glowing like embers. The string quartet reaches a luminous crescendo, and petals—each etched with past misunderstandings—drift from the ceiling, landing on tongues like sweet snowflakes, melting away old injuries.

Finally, a mirror appears at the room’s center, tall and rippling. Everyone gathers behind you, their reflections overlaying yours until you are a mosaic of every relationship you’ve ever held—fractured, mended, still in progress. The glass whispers, Do you accept this tapestry?

You nod. The mirror melts into silver mist, absorbing your assent, and the conservatory windows swing open. A warm breeze sweeps through, carrying twilight and distant thunder. Lanterns ignite along an unseen path outside, beckoning you toward dawn. As you step into the fragrant night, you realize the reunion was never with them alone—it was with every untended corner of your own heart.

And then you wake, hands still tingling with phantom starlight, mouth tasting faintly of lilac and closure.
