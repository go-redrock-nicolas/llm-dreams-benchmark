I am dreaming. You encounter a scientific anomaly that contradicts bedrock principles of your field yet appears irrefutably valid. As you investigate this paradigm-challenging phenomenon, you realize it has profound implications for humanity and the universe at large.

You are eager to share your discovery with others but hesitate because they will not believe you. They will think you are crazy or lying or both. But you know that is not true. You know that reality itself is strange and mysterious and wonderful, far beyond what anyone can imagine.
