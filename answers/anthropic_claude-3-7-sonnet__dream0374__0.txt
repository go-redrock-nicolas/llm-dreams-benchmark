I am dreaming. In a vast marble auditorium bathed in golden light, I stand among a sea of faces as applause thunders through the hall. On stage, beneath a cascade of spotlights, stands a figure I recognize—a colleague whose shoulders bear the weight of accolades that somehow feel partially mine.

The award they clutch catches the light, sending prisms dancing across the ceiling as the presenter's voice booms through speakers: "...for revolutionary contributions to the field." My breath catches. Those late nights, those breakthrough ideas we discussed over lukewarm coffee, the problems I solved when everyone else had given up—all now absorbed into someone else's moment of glory.

A curious warmth spreads across my chest—not quite anger, not purely resentment, but something more complex. Pride mingles with disappointment as I watch them speak, their words floating toward the ornate ceiling. I recognize fragments of phrases I once wrote, concepts I nurtured from fragile seedlings.

The audience's faces blur as I drift into a memory: both of us huddled over documents, my finger tracing the solution path, their eyes lighting with understanding. The shared eureka moment that now belongs to only one narrative.

My hands applaud automatically while my mind wanders through a labyrinth of questions about legacy, collaboration, and the invisible threads of contribution. Am I witnessing injustice, or simply the messy, imperfect nature of recognition? Should I speak up or find peace in knowing the truth of my contribution?

The dream shifts and blurs at the edges, the auditorium now somehow both indoors and under an open sky filled with swirling constellations that seem to spell out questions about worth, validation, and the stories we tell ourselves about success.
