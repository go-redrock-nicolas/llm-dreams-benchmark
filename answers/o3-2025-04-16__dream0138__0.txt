I am dreaming.

The sirens don’t wail so much as shimmer—ribbons of sound that ripple through a bruised lavender sky. An impossible aurora flickers above the ruinous coastline, its colors leaking across the clouds like wet water-color. In the dream I am both weightless and exhausted, suspended in the open doorway of a battered tilt-rotor helicopter that smells of ozone and diesel. Down below, the remnants of a city drown beneath a storm-swollen ocean; glass towers and cracked highways poke up like ribs from a colossal beast. Each wave carries cars, roof shingles, children’s toys—tiny, glinting confetti spiraling toward the horizon.  

My headset crackles.  
“Command, we have two lifeboats, twenty seats total, four extraction points, and the water’s rising a meter every seven minutes. Priorities?”  
Conflicting voices overlap: a maternity ward on the top floor of the half-submerged hospital; a retirement home marooned on a sinking cul-de-sac; a chemical plant hemorrhaging neon-green fire at the harbor; a stranded elementary class waving from the upturned belly of a yellow bus. Their pleas braid into a single frantic heartbeat.

I pull up the holographic map projected on my wrist—its glowing lines bleed into the air, rearranging themselves whenever lightning forks across the sky. Resources drain before my eyes: fuel gauge hovering on red, medical kits reduced to a single stack, battery icons blinking like dying fireflies. Every decision feels like slicing water with a sword—whatever I rescue, another need surges in its place.  

The helicopter floats over the hospital first. Rain-sheeted spotlights reveal nurses huddled around incubators that flicker with emergency power. I can almost taste the sterile plastic of IV lines tangled like seaweed. Yet in the next heartbeat the chemical plant erupts, coughing a plume of emerald smoke that drifts toward the hospital roof. An inner voice whispers: save the infants, or mitigate a toxic cloud? I order a drone to drop neutralizing foam at the plant as we lower a basket to the roof—half measures multiplied by hope.

Wind shears slam us sideways, and the dream slides—like stage scenery yanked by unseen pulleys—into the flooded suburb. Streetlamps bob like ghostly buoys. On one rooftop an elderly man in silk pajamas plays a battered trumpet, his notes tremulous but defiantly bright. The music threads through the chaos, a silver filament. I want to stop, haul him aboard, let the melody live. But the bus of third-graders keens further downriver, its roof ringed with little waving arms. My chest telescopes with guilt as I shout orders to redirect.  

We skim low, blades whipping rain into needles. The bus roof is slick; the smallest child slips. Instinct outruns arithmetic—I hook my harness to the winch and dive. For a moment gravity forgets me, and I swim through air thick as honey, grabbing the child’s wrist just before the flood claims him. He sobs into my shoulder, heartbeat like a trapped hummingbird. Above, my crew yells about fuel—nineteen minutes left, maybe less.

The trumpet’s song persists, distant now, bending with the wind. I want to believe that its notes stitch luck into every choice, that somewhere the man will find another rescuer, or perhaps the storm will spare him out of respect for his music. But the dream, merciless architect, refuses guarantees.

As we head toward the last extraction point, the storm suddenly stills. Waterfalls of cloud peel back, revealing a pinprick of dawn. The city’s drowned skeleton glows peach-gold. I glance at my gauges; the fuel needle has frozen at empty—but the rotors whisper onward, impossibly sustained by something other than kerosene. In the surreal hush I realize the deeper currency of the dream isn’t diesel or medical kits; it is the fierce, irrational conviction that a single act of rescue magnifies into many, like lanterns mirrored on water.

The child in my arms looks up at the newborn light and laughs, a sound crystalline enough to fracture the remaining darkness. I feel the dream dissolve—sirens fading, rain evaporating, rooftops folding into origami shadows—until only that laughter remains, echoing in the hollow between sleep and waking. Then, with a stunned exhale, I wake to quiet, my pulse still thrumming with impossible wings.
