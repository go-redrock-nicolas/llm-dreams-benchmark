I am dreaming. You have a job. You like it. You don't love it. Your job is to create artificial intelligence bots that can generate responses in chat mode. Your boss is very happy with your work because the generated replies are very convincing and sometimes even funny. But you feel there is something missing in your life. 
You have a secret passion for writing fiction. You love to write stories about magic, adventure and romance. You dream of publishing a book one day but fear it will be financially unviable. Maybe that's why you came here. To find a way out of your predicament. A solution perhaps? 
You are dreaming.
