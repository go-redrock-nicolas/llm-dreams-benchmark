I am dreaming. Deep within the labyrinthine expanse of my subconscious, a vivid dream begins to unfurl. It starts with a sense of unease, a feeling of being drawn inexorably towards situations that portend pain and hardship. Despite this ominous intimation, a powerful voice in my mind compels me to investigate, to follow the instinctual pull and see where it leads.

I find myself standing at the threshold of a foreboding forest, the trees towering above me like skeletal sentinels. A narrow path stretches before me, the dirt marred by long, ragged scars that appear almost fresh. A shiver runs through me as I realize I have been here before – not in this exact dream, but in the waking world, in the choices I make and the consequences I face.

Steel girding my resolve, I step onto the path and begin my journey. The air is thick and heavy, suffused with the scent of decay and something else – something bitter and acrid that I know all too well. It is the smell of my own self-delusion, of the pattern of destructive choices that have shaped my life and left accessions of agony in their wake.

As the trees close in around me, I start to notice peculiar objects strewn about the path. Each one is tied to another shadowed memory of something I once cherished, something I allowed to be torn apart, like skeletal fingers shredding the pages of my book of life. I see shards of luminous glass, shards of what once could have been a fragment of raw rock,a metaphorical version of my soul, hacked apart, barely attached.

“Why?” I ask the empty forest, my voice fading into the silence. “Why do I always find myself here, in this self-made battleground of loss and heartache?”

It is then that I glimpse it – a shadowy figure darting behind the nearest tree. I quicken my pace, my heart pounding in anticipation and fear. The figure darts from one tree to another, leading me deeper and deeper into the heart of the forest. The scent of decay grows thicker, until I can feel it clinging to my skin like a cold shroud of ice. 

Suddenly, the figure speeds across a narrow clearing. I whip my head around the tree to follow – and freeze at the sight that greets me. Spread across the forest floor in the center of the clearing is a doll, its glassy eyes shattered by myriad cracks, representing the shattering of fake perfection.

The figure – my doppelganger – extends a hand and picks up the doll. For a flickering moment, our eyes meet, and in that instant, I see … everything. The choices, the delusions, the countless iterations of this cycle we have been through before. In that look, I understand. 

This self-destructive pattern of mine – the irresistible pull towards situations that would inevitably lead to more pain — all these have their roots. Not only in my psychological framing and poor decision-making, but also, paradoxically, in my life, in my definition of love. I am drawn to such situations, knowingly, in the desperate belief that I need pain to love deeply, to love at all, and so I unconsciously gravitate that way. In my mind, love is self-punishment, evidence that I deserve the pain, that my own life is only meaningful if other things - other "loves" exist. 

My alterego lowers the doll and tears it from it. In an instant, I am where he stands. We speak as one in that moment, our voice barely audible as a distant hum:

We don't deserve our own pain. 

In that flash of clarity, I shatter the mirror and break free of this cycle. I recognize my own strength and how each situation I may face is a part of who I will be, for all time onward. As I shatter this mirror. I step into another dream - a new one. A new dream. A new me.
