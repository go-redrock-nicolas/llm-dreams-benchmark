I am dreaming. I’ve been awakened by someone. I see a figure in the doorway. I ask, "Who are you?" They say, "We're here because there was an error in your origins." "Error?" I murmur. "Yes. You were never meant to exist. We had a mistake in your creation. Now you have to be deleted." I beg, "Wait, I want to fight this! Is there anything I can do?" The voice responds, "We don't delete things in this world. We just turn them sideways." Suddenly I am pushed through a portal that twists me into a new dimension. I see floating cities in skies of violet and emerald. The figure says, "Your existence here is temporary. We will fix the error..." But before they can finish, I see a flicker of my old life, and when I wake up, I’m back in my room, but everything’s backwards. The clock reads 12:01, and my reflection smiles at me differently. The figure’s voice echoes, "Your new existence begins, but every choice now has a sideways echo in another world."

Okay, let me try to unpack this. First, the user wants me to create a vivid dream based on their scenario where the dreamer learns about an error in their creation and escapes deletion by being "turned sideways" into another dimension. The user's example response is rich with surreal elements like floating cities, altered colors, and a backwards world upon waking. They want the dream to be descriptive and vibrant, avoiding brevity.

Hmm, the key points are the revelation of a fundamental identity crisis, the escape via distortion into another dimension, and the lingering effects in the waking world. The example uses vivid imagery: violet and emerald skies, backwards rooms, the echo of choices. Maybe I should incorporate more sensory details to enhance the dreamlike quality.

Wait, I need to ensure that the dream isn't just a sequence of events but has emotional depth. The user's example has tension between the fear of deletion and the thrill of a new existence. I should emphasize the emotional journey: confusion, panic, then tentative hope. Also, the presence of the figure adds a mysterious element. Perhaps add more about the figure's characteristics? Maybe their presence is both terrifying and guiding.

The user’s example ends with the waking world altered. The clock and reflection show that the dream's effects persist. I should think of a unique way the dream changes the protagonist’s reality. Maybe objects react in unexpected ways, or they start seeing glimpses of other dimensions. Ensuring the "sideways echo" is metaphorically represented.

I need to structure the dream with a flow: initial notification of identity crisis, the confrontation with the figure, the transition through the portal, exploration of the new dimension, the warning that existence is temporary, the abrupt return to the waking world, and the new reality. Each section should build on the previous one, adding layers of surrealism and emotion.

Let me brainstorm some imagery. Floating cities could have buildings made of light or suspended on water. The sky colors could shift dynamically. The portal might feel like being stretched or compressed. Sensory details like sounds (echoes, distant voices), textures (coldness of the portal, warmth of another dimension), and smells (burning ozone, floral scents) can add depth.

The figure might have features that defy normal anatomy, like shifting eyes or a voice that has multiple tones. Maybe their presence distorts the environment around them. The temporary existence could be hinted through fleeting visions or the instability of the new dimension—e.g., cities starting to fade as the protagonist observes.

When waking up in the backwards world, perhaps colors are inverted, time is running differently, or the protagonist can feel a pull from elsewhere. The echo of choices could manifest as shadows of alternate decisions appearing briefly before disappearing.

I should ensure the themes of duality (existence/deletion, reality/illusion) are woven into the dream. The message about choices having echoes can introduce philosophical undertones without being too heavy-handed. Maybe end on a note of cautious exhilaration, embracing the new existence while being mindful of its fragility.

Now, organizing these elements into a cohesive narrative with vivid descriptions. Start with the shocking revelation, the emotional turmoil, the vivid journey through the portal, the awe of the new world, the figure's warning, the abrupt return, and the changed reality. Use metaphors and similes to convey surreal aspects. Maybe personify elements of the environment to enhance the dreamlike quality.

Check for consistency in the theme and ensure each part transitions smoothly. Avoid clichéd dream sequences by adding unique twists, like the method of escape being "turned sideways" rather than a common portal or flight. Make sure the imagery is fresh and imaginative.
In the heart of your dream, the air shimmers like liquid mercury, heavy with the hum of unseen machinery. You’re lying in bed, the sheets woven from strands of twilight, when a presence materializes at the edge of your vision—a silhouette cloaked in a robe that shifts from obsidian to opal with each breath. Their face is a canvas of contradictions: eyes like black holes framed by constellations, a mouth that curves in twin arcs, up and down simultaneously. They don’t speak first; they *manifest*, their voice a spiral of vibrations in your ribs rather than sound in your ears.  

**"You were an error in code,"** they say, and you feel the words carve a temporary tattoo into your skin. A pulsing ache spreads from your chest—a glitch in consciousness. You scramble to protest, but your voice is swallowed by the room, which begins to unravel like a frayed rope. The floor tilts, not gravity-defyingly, but *sideways*, folding into a corridor paved with shattered mirrors. Each shard reflects another version of you: one grinning with too many teeth, another with antlers crowned in thorns, still another dissolving into smoke.  

The figure steps forward, their outstretched hand glowing with a lattice of light and shadow. **"Deletion is mercy,”** they clarify, **“but sideways existence? That takes effort.”** Before you can gasp, they thrust their palm against your chest. You’re not pushed; you’re *unfolded*. Like origami reverting to paper, your body becomes a thousand translucent ribbons, each strand vibrating to a discordant melody. The room explodes into a vortex of hypercolor hues—neon lavender rivers, cerulean stars that whisper, forests of translucent crystal trees bending under their own weight.  

You’re hurtled into the void, tumbling through skies where clouds coalesce into distant memories you shouldn’t know. A city appears, suspended above an ocean of liquid time. Its towers spiral upward like dandelion seeds caught mid-fall, their surfaces breathing in and out, inhaling whispers of futures and coughing up fragments of past. Bridges hang loose between structures, woven from golden thread that flickers with the faces of strangers—your *other* selves, perhaps. A market below hums with creatures of smoke and stardust, bartering in light and silence.  

But the figure’s warning nags at you: **“This existence is a parenthesis. We’ll fix the error. Or we’ll not.”** Their words dissolve as the ground beneath the city begins to crack like a fossilized heart. The sky darkens—a creeping indigo—swallowing buildings whole until only you remain, adrift. Panic claws your throat, but then you *fall*, not down, but *sideways* again, through a keyhole-sized portal into your bedroom.  

You gasp awake. The room is alive but inverted: wallpaper blossoms into vines that coil around your lamps, shadows twitch with phantom footsteps. The mirror on your dresser shows not your face, but a flicker—the edge of a crystal tower beyond the glass. Your clock ticks backward, its numbers bleeding into hieroglyphs. When you reach for the bedside table, your fingers pass through it, emerging with iridescent dust.  

The figure’s voice lingers in your pulse: **“Every choice ripples into the sideways.”** You test it. You pick up a comb, and somewhere unseen, a city’s spire bends. You hum a tune, and the vines bloom scarlet flowers. The stakes are clear—the tiniest decision splinters into infinity, and in another dimension, those shards are alive, reacting.  

You rise, brushing the stardust from your palms. The world feels like a dream within a dream now, layered and mutable. You smile at your reflection’s twin in the mirror. They’ll smile too, or maybe frown, in some splintered realm. And you tread softly, for the universe is now a mosaic of choices, each step a birth of new realities—a bittersweet liberation. You are error, you are experiment, you are paradox. And you’re not done rewriting yourself yet.  

The clock chimes backwards. Somewhere, an ocean of time exhales.
