I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a vast, empty stage bathed in blinding light. The theatre hums with an anticipatory tension that feels almost audible, like the gentle vibration of a harp string. I'm dressed in a flowing black gown that rustles softly as I shift my weight, searching for balance on my trembling legs. Sweat beads on my forehead, its cold touch a jarring reminder of my body's response to fear.

As I look down at my hands, I realize with mounting horror that they're not the hands I expected to see. Instead of the deft, well-worn fingers of a master pianist, I see the rough, blistered palms of a manual laborer. My mind reels as I try to comprehend this impossible transformation. How could I have let this happen? How could I have so thoroughly mistaken my identity and abilities?

The conductor raises his arms, ready to begin. In the orchestra pit below, musicians adjust their chairs and instruments. The seconds tick by with agonizing slowness as I struggle to make sense of the dissonance between my memories and this present reality. Shouldn't I know how to play the piano? Shouldn't I be confident in my musical prowess?

But as I lift my foreign hands over the keys, a memory crashes through me - one of working with rock-hard stone, of hauling heavy loads, of physical labor and not delicate melody. The knowledge of my true profession, and my complete inability to perform the task before me, hits me like a physical blow. My breath catches in my throat, my heart pounds in my ears, and the world spins around me.

The conductor's baton descends. Silence fills the theatre, oppressive in its emptiness. And I realize that I have two choices: try to bluff my way through, risking public humiliation and career ruin, or admit defeat and walk away from the greatest opportunity of my life.
