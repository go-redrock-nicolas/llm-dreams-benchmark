I am dreaming. You find yourself deep within the earth, the air thick and musty around you as you make your way through the winding passages of a vast, ancient cavern. The rock walls gleam wetly in the flickering light of your small torch, throwing stark shadows that dance and flicker around you. Water drips rhythmically from stalactites high above, echoing endlessly in the suffocating silence.

As you press further into the depths, a low rumble begins to emanate from somewhere within the bowels of the earth. The vibrations grow stronger, shaking the very ground you stand on. Suddenly, the unthinkable happens. With a deafening crash, a massive boulder breaks free from the ceiling and plunges down, sealing off the passageway behind you with a suffocating thud. You spin around in horror, realizing with sinking dread that your escape route is severed. 

Your torch begins to sputter ominously, the flame flickering and dimming. In desperation, you swirl it about in the air, trying to keep a steady flame. But the last of the oil leaks out, and with a final hiss, the light winks out, leaving you in complete and utter darkness. An unbearable darkness swallows you whole.

Panic rises in your throat as the clammy walls close in, the suffocating weight of the earth above pressing down on you. Your breathing grows rapid and ragged, each gulp of air feeling like a precious commodity. You reach out blindly, desperately searching for any clue to your surroundings, but your hands grasp only the cold, damp stone.

Sensing a presence in the pitch black, hairs on the back of your neck rise. The air itself seems to pulse with an uncanny energy, a sense of something ancient and malevolent stirring in the shadows. A faint clicking sound begins to emanate from somewhere ahead, growing louder and more insistent with each passing second. Like the skittering of countless legs.

Terror grips your heart as you realize you are not alone down here. Something else moves in the deep darkness with you, and it knows you're there too. Helpless and blinded, you press yourself against the wall, every fiber of your being screaming at you to run. But there is no escape. Only the cloying miasma of dread and the unending night.
