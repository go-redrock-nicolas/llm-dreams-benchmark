I am dreaming. wander into an ancient forest swaddled in midnight-blue mist, each footstep stirring gentle spirals of light along the mossy earth. The air is fragrant with wild thyme and the sweet, unfamiliar spice of something timeless. Before me, a circle of luminous stones hums—standing tall, etched with intricate glyphs that shimmer in shifting colors.

In the center, an elder cloaked in iridescent feathers beckons with a serene nod. Her eyes are galaxies deep, reflecting both comfort and challenge. She stretches out her palm, offering a polished crystal that pulses like a heartbeat. I take it, feeling a powerful vibration thread through my nerves, every doubt and worry melting into the hush of the woods around me.

The elder guides me through a ritual silent yet profound: tracing unseen patterns in the air, breathing in rhythm with a song rising not from lips but from the very earth. As my fingers follow, memory stirs—vision upon vision unspools behind my closed eyes. I glimpse lifetimes lived under different suns, each connected by a luminous thread to this very moment.

A sense of belonging floods me, unexpected and familiar at once, as if I have finally stepped into my true shape. The practice—this dance of breath, crystal, and ancient song—opens a reservoir within, welling with purpose and peace. I am no longer merely dreaming; I am awakening to the oldest parts of myself, drawn forward with every heartbeat on this sacred path.
