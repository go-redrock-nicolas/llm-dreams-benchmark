I am dreaming. I find myself in a world where the sky pulses with an aurora of deep purples and blues, like a heartbeat made of light. The weight on my shoulders is almost physical - I'm carrying a small, glowing orb that contains what appears to be a miniature galaxy, and within it, I can sense a life force growing weaker by the moment.

Through winding crystal pathways that float in space, I'm running, my bare feet making musical notes with each step on the translucent surface. The orb in my hands feels warm, like a fever, and I know with absolute certainty that if I don't reach the Healing Springs - which I somehow know exist beyond the horizon - the life within will fade away completely.

The air grows thicker as I run, becoming like honey, making each movement more difficult. Shadows begin to form around me, taking the shape of hands reaching out, trying to slow my progress. Their whispers echo in my mind: "Let it go... it's not your burden... rest..."

But I can't. The connection to this tiny universe in my hands feels as vital as my own heartbeat. Through the crystalline paths I persist, even as they begin to crack beneath my feet. Each step could send me plummeting into the starry void below, yet the responsibility drives me forward.

The orb pulses weaker now, its light dimming. I can feel tears streaming down my face, but they float upward instead of falling, forming a trail of glowing droplets behind me like a comet's tail. Just ahead, I see a shimmer of hope - a cascade of liquid starlight falling upward into infinity. The Healing Springs.

I'm so close, yet the air has become almost solid. Each movement feels like pushing through stone, but the life in my hands depends on me. I won't - I can't - let it fade...

The dream begins to blur at the edges, reality threatening to intrude, but the weight of responsibility remains crystal clear, pressing down on my dream-self with the gravity of a thousand worlds...
