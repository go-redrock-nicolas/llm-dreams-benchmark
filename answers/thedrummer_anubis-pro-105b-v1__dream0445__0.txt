I am dreaming. I find myself floating gently through the air, my body weightless and fluid like a feather carried on the breeze. As I drift, I notice that the surroundings are swirling around me, shifting and morphing into different colors, shapes, and patterns. The world is in constant motion, like a vibrant, living painting.

Suddenly, I hear a soft, melodious voice speaking to me. The voice is ethereal and comforting, and it seems to emanate from all around me. "Why do you deflect compliments while readily accepting criticism?" the voice asks gently.

I ponder the question, and as I do, images begin to appear before me. I see moments from my waking life where someone has praised me or acknowledged my accomplishments, only for me to brush off their words or downplay my role. I see the confused looks on the faces of those who try to acknowledge my efforts.

The voice continues, "Your self-validation is imbalanced, like a scale with one side heavily weighted. You hesitate to accept the good, while embracing the bad and letting it define you."

As the voice speaks, I feel a deep understanding wash over me. I realize that this pattern has been a habit for me, a way of avoiding pride or arrogance. But now I see how it has held me back from fully acknowledging my strengths and growth.

The dream shifts again, and I find myself standing on a cliff overlooking a vast, shimmering sea. The water is calm and clear, and I can see my own reflection staring back at me from its surface. The voice speaks one more time, saying, "It is time to balance your self-validation. You cannot grow by constantly dwelling on your shortcomings. Learn to accept compliments graciously, and use them as fuel for your journey forward."

With those words, the dream begins to fade, but the message stays with me. I know that I must take this newfound awareness into my waking life, learning to accept praise and criticism with equal grace and humility. The dream has shown me a truth about myself, and now it is up to me to embrace it and become a better version of myself.
