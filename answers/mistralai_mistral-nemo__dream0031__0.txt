I am dreaming. I'm traversing the pulsating veins of the city, aboard a subway car that's an orchestra of clanks, rattles, and a humming meditation of a thousand daily soliloquies. The car, a vibrant|

But for a moment, we were not just passengers on this train, but voyagers in the unknown, our hearts beating as one, our voices united in a shared, strange song.
