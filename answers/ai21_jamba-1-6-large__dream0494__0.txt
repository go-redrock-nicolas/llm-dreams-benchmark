I am dreaming. In my dream, I'm navigating a surreal and expansive landscape. I'm standing at the cliff's edge, the vast, endless ocean stretching out before me. The sky above me is alive with swirling clouds that resemble immense, rotating galaxies, shifting in every shade of violet and indigo. The ocean glitters with golden light, waves crashing gently against the jagged rocks below.  

There's an untamed, primal energy to this place. The air vibrates with an unseen force, electrifying my skin. I can feel the deep rumble of the waves, the thunderous energy pulsing through the water. The scent of salt and mist fills my lungs, grounding me despite the wild beauty surrounding me. 

I look upward, and there, perched on the edge of the cliff, is a magnificent creature—a bird of prey unlike any I’ve ever seen. It’s massive, spanning the width of the cliff, its wings a dazzling array of emerald, crimson, and gold. Its eyes, sharp and clear, meet mine. In those eyes, I perceive an understanding far beyond anything I’ve ever known. I feel my body relax and surrender to the dream’s current, the knowledge coursing through my veins. 

The bird's voice echoes in my mind, a deep, resonant tone: “You are ready.” 

Its massive wings unfurl, and with one powerful beat, it lifts into the air. The earth shakes with the force of its ascent, and I am caught in the updraft of its passage. I rise, feeling weightless, as the earth below diminishes. The wind rushes through my hair, and my heart quickens, not from fear, but from a profound recognition. 

I am in the embrace of the bird, circling higher and higher. Each beat of its wings Propels us through layers of consciousness. We soar through clouds that part like curtains, revealing galaxies and entire universes swirling within them. Time feels suspended, and I feel the boundaries of my Self dissolving into the infinite. 

As we ascend higher, I see my younger self, standing on the cliff's edge, looking up. I am no longer that version of myself, yet I am still connected. I realize that I am witnessing the evolution of my own soul—my journey of healing and integration. The child I once was, the one who lived in the shadow of fear, now looks up at me with hope and recognition. 

The bird’s feathers shimmer, releasing tiny sparks of light that rain down upon the younger me, each one a moment of wisdom or love. The child reaches out, catching the light, and smiles. I feel the connection deepening, my present self and past self merging, the weight of past wounds lifting. I understand, now, that I am the child, but I am also the bird—I am both, boundless and eternal. 

The dream shifts, and I am back on the cliff. The bird lands before me, its massive presence towering over me. Its wings fold gently, and it bows its head. I step forward, placing my hand on its chest. I feel the raw, ancient power of this creature beating within me. It is both alien and familiar. I understand, now, that it has always been a part of me—a symbol of my own strength and resilience. 

“Always remember,” it whispers, its voice softening, becoming a soothing balm. “You have always been the one you needed. You have everything you need within you.” 

And as I wake from the dream, the lingering sensation of flight and connection remains. The landscape of my dream lingers, and I feel an overwhelming sense of peace and understanding. The lessons from the bird are not new, yet they feel more concrete than ever before. I hold onto them as I return to the waking world, ready to face whatever comes next. 

I am ready.
