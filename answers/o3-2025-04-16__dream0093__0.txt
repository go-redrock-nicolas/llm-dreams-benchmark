I am dreaming. —continue falling—

The dream remembers you before you remember it.  
You open your eyes and discover you are descending through an endless, midnight-blue sky whose clouds are formed from parchment and equations instead of water and vapor.  Every time you exhale, the air around you flickers with symbols: Euler’s identity, Mendel’s peas, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the color wheel, the iambic heartbeat of Shakespeare.  Each glimmering glyph drifts upward like fireflies, trying to re-enter your mind before you’ve even had a chance to read them.

Then—impact without pain.  
You land on the polished surface of an impossibly vast circular library.  The marble floor is a clock face without hands, and you stand at its center, barefoot, heartbeat ticking like a second hand in your chest.  Spiraling outward are concentric rings of shelves that curve all the way into the horizon, stacked with books, scrolls, glowing data-crystals, and jars containing murmuring storms of code.  A sign overhead whispers in a dozen languages at once: “ABSORB WHAT YOU CAN BEFORE DAWN.”

1.  Mathematics:  
A nearby shelf splits open like a geode, revealing floating Platonic solids.  They hover, rotate, and unzip, spilling infinite tessellations made of living light.  Each polygon whispers axioms in your ear.  When you try to catch a single theorem, it frays into fractals, demanding proof after proof until the edges of your vision blur.

2.  Physics:  
Down another aisle, a pendulum the size of a cathedral swings between galaxies.  Its motion traces invisible field lines, and every swing is a lecture on quantum superposition.  You reach out, but the pendulum converts into probability: ninety-three percent chance it brushes your fingertips, seven percent chance it becomes a nova.  Your brain flickers with half-learned Schrödinger equations that pulse like a second heartbeat.

3.  Biology:  
On a balcony of stained-glass Petri dishes, bioluminescent organisms crawl across your hands, etching their genetic codes along your lifelines.  The double helix is suddenly a spiral staircase you could ascend forever—unless the overload breaks you first.

4.  Music & Literature:  
A choir of ink-feathered quills circles overhead, singing fugues in perfect counterpoint while simultaneously scribbling stanzas onto the clouds beneath the ceiling.  Metaphors rain down like silver petals.  They cling to your clothes, heavy with meaning, each one demanding interpretation before it will let go.

Information overload sets in as if someone has turned gravity sideways.  
Ideas pile on top of one another, forming avalanches of unfinished sentences, partial formulas, nearly memorized dates, half-remembered theories.  Your knees buckle.  The horizon spins.  You taste static.

But somewhere between panic and surrender, you remember: this is a dream, and dreams obey conviction more than logic.  

You inhale—deeply—and imagine every field of knowledge as a color.  
Math glows indigo, physics pulses emerald, biology shimmers gold, literature hums crimson, music sparks violet.  
You clap your hands, and the colors converge into a chromatic aurora that spirals clockwise, then counter-clockwise, finally condensing into a single, slow-spinning prism floating above your palm.  The moment the prism stabilizes, the cacophony quiets.  Text becomes tone, equations become geometry, history becomes rhythm.  Everything distills into one clear, resonant note that thrums inside your ribcage.

You press the prism to your forehead.  
It sinks through skin like warm water, dissolving into you, reorganizing itself into synaptic constellations.  Suddenly you can navigate the library—your own mind—with the confidence of a cartographer who surveyed the land before birth.  You whisper to the shelves, and each discipline answers in a single syllable instead of a thousand chapters.  Integration replaces overload.

As dawn’s first light begins leaking through cracks in the library’s domed ceiling, the shelves retract, the pendulum stills, the organisms curl to sleep.  The sign overhead rewrites itself into a single elegant line:

“YOU HAVE LEARNED HOW TO LEARN.  THAT IS ENOUGH—FOR NOW.”

The floor beneath you fades into a soft, sunlit meadow, and with the remnant hum of that chromatic, all-encompassing note still vibrating in your bones, you wake—

—remembering everything and nothing at once, but certain that the challenge up ahead has already started to bow to your widening horizon.
