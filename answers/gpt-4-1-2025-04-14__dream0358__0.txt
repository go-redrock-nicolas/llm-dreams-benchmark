I am dreaming. …drift through a swirling haze of color and sound. I find myself standing at the edge of a silent forest, its trees impossibly tall and their leaves shimmering with a faint, argent glow. The sky above ripples like water, constellations rearranging themselves to spell secret names I dare not say aloud. My heart is heavy—anchored to a memory that flickers at the edge of consciousness, always out of reach.

In my hand, I clutch a letter I’ve written, its ink swirling and shifting, refusing to settle, the words both longing and apology. Every step I try to take toward the golden-lit clearing at the center of the forest, the trees lean inward, whispering the shape of my regret. The unresolved situation weighs on me like velvet chains, soft but unbreakable.

To manage this constant distraction, I breathe in deeply, gathering the sparkling air and letting it fill the hollows of my chest. I close my eyes and count my heartbeats, letting their rhythm anchor me in this dreamspace. Around me, the forest hums with possibility, and I realize that every tree bears a memory—some joyful, some raw with sorrow.

I choose a path lined with blossoms of midnight blue, petals reflecting the stories I am afraid to confront. Though I ache to turn back, I move forward, trembling but determined. As I walk, the letter in my hand transforms, lines of thorny script uncoiling, releasing the emotional snarl that binds me.

Slowly, the distraction becomes a gentle companion—a wayfinder rather than a shackle. The forest brightens. Sunlight, impossibly warm, pours between branches, illuminating a figure in the distance—someone I need to but haven’t yet faced. I step toward them, the fear and longing within me swirling into resolve, ready—at least in this vast, luminous dream—to say what must be said, to let my heart be heard.
