I am dreaming.

I stand in a vast atrium of glass, a cathedral-sized greenhouse balanced on the edge of night. Moonlight pours through the panes and splashes across polished marble floors veined like the pages of an ancient atlas. I’m dressed in a black suit that fits too perfectly—tailored success—and yet the pockets feel full of sand. Every footstep crunches faintly, as though the grains are leaking from me, trailing proof that something essential is slipping away.

A single door appears in the far wall, framed by ivy that pulses with a pale, bioluminescent green. A plaque beside it reads, “ENTER FOR MEANING.” It’s the kind of sign so impossibly direct that it feels like a prank. Still, the desert in my chest is widening, so I push the door and step through.

The ground tilts. Suddenly I’m in a colossal library with no walls, its shelves stacked with glowing orbs in place of books. Each orb hums like a gentle hive, casting aureoles of light that reveal carved titles etched in floating silver script: “The Day You Won the Award,” “The Morning They Clapped,” “The Salary Raise.” I lift one orb; inside swirls a miniature replay of my greatest public triumph. It’s dazzling, luminous, flawless—yet when I press it close to my heart, it feels cool, inert, hollow.

Across the library a librarian materializes: a towering figure wearing a cloak stitched from night sky—pinprick stars wobble across the fabric. Their face is simply a shifting constellation. They hold out a thread of shimmering gold. “A guide,” they say, voice echoing like choir bells underwater. “Follow it until it hums.”

I accept the thread. The moment it touches my palm it lengthens on its own, pulling me away from the comfort of catalogued accomplishments. Shelves fall, quietly collapsing like houses of cards. I walk.

The floor becomes an autumn forest path, frescoes of red-gold leaves drifting down and turning into stray notes of music when they land. The golden thread runs ahead, weaving between tree trunks whose bark is engraved with questions I’ve never dared to ask: “Is applause louder than silence?” “Which weighs more, a trophy or a hug?” “When did you last stand still?” The letters glow briefly, then sink into the bark as though embarrassed to be seen.

I reach a clearing lit by an impossibly low, violet sun. In the center sits a carnival mirror. When I face it, I don’t see my reflection; instead, shifting scenes play across the glass—moments when I was nine years old scribbling comic books in the attic, seventeen playing piano in an empty auditorium long after practice ended, twenty-four sketching designs on napkins just to feel ink flowing. Each image glows with a warmth the glowing orbs lacked. They flicker like firelight on cold hands.

Something tugs—the thread is resonating, a low, cello-like hum that thrums through my bones. I glance down; it’s vibrating so strongly that it blurs, then suddenly dives straight into the mirror. Without thinking I step forward and dissolve into the silver.

I fall into a vast cosmic ocean composed of inky water and floating idea-constellations. Stars are strung together by nerve-like filaments, sparking synapses of potential. I realize each constellation is one of my “what-ifs”: the book I never wrote, the language I never learned, the friend I never called back. They orbit me slowly, and the thread coils around them, connecting everything to my chest. The cello hum becomes a chorus—hundreds of private desires singing the same note: Become. Become.

A surge of buoyancy lifts me upward, breaching the ocean like a whale breaking the surface. I’m suddenly airborne over an infinite patchwork city—skyscrapers built of accolades on one side, and, on the other, modest cottages stitched from laughter, tears, midnight phone calls, quiet sentences that changed someone’s day. The cottages glow brighter than the towers, though they’re half-hidden beneath blossoms of ordinary light.

A tempest flashes on the horizon—storm clouds shaped like timepieces, clocks melting in thunderheads. The towers quake, their mirrored faces cracking. The cottages merely sway, roofs whispering in the wind. I understand something wordlessly: legacy built on spotlight alone cannot weather the storm of passing years, but small acts rooted in authenticity anchor themselves in the soil of memory, impervious to erosion.

The golden thread shortens until only a loop remains, forming a luminous ring that hovers before me. Inside its circumference pulses a single phrase: “Live as a verb, not a résumé.” I reach out. The ring sinks into my chest and becomes a heartbeat.

The dream begins to shimmer apart. Glass from the initial atrium rains down as harmless petals of light. The library, the forest, the ocean, the city—all fold into a single point that settles in my palm: a seed, iridescent, no larger than a raindrop.

I wake—yet not fully. Dawn’s first light is filtering through real curtains, and my hand is closed around nothing but warmth. Still, I feel the seed beating softly beneath my sternum, just under the skin, promising to sprout if I guard it, feed it, choose my days with intention. It is tiny. It is impossible to ignore. It hums like a golden thread awaiting every next step.
