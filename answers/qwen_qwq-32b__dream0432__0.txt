I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of ripe pineapples and the faint tang of salt. I’m standing in the middle of a forest, but not just any forest—this one’s edges blur into a horizonless expanse of swirling gold and violet, like the sky at twilight but somehow inverted, as though the earth has met the heavens and merged. The trees around me aren’t ordinary; their bark shimmers with an iridescent sheen, and their leaves are translucent, filtering light into prismatic shards that pepper the ground. Every step I take sends ripples through the moss beneath my feet, each ripple sparking tiny, glowing fireflies that spiral upward before dissolving into the air like smoke.

There’s a lake here, too—its surface as smooth and black as a polished obsidian mirror. When I reach out to touch it, my fingertips don’t break the surface but instead pass through, leaving temporary ripples that hum faintly, almost mournfully. Around the lake, the ground is scattered with what appear to be crystalline flowers, their petals glowing in hues of cerulean and amber. But despite their beauty, there’s an undercurrent of tension. A voice in my mind whispers that something is missing, that no matter how breathtaking this world is, I sense a profound lack. I’m drawn to a small, gnarled tree in the center of the clearing, its branches heavy with fruit that resembles golden apples. Yet when I approach, the fruit seems to dance just out of reach, receding as I stretch for them. Even after grabbing one, it dematerializes in my hand, leaving only a faint trace of its warmth.
