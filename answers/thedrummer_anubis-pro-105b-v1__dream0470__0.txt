I am dreaming. In the dream, I float gently on a cloud, my weightless body supported by the softest down feathers. Brilliant hues of magenta, turquoise, and amber swirl around me, the colors deepening and shifting hypnotically as I drift through the clear sky. 

I am surrounded by tiny fluttering wings - not just butterfly wings but wings made of paper, petals, and shimmering silver-gray moonbeams, each one representing a person, situation, and thing I never fully appreciated before. They float to me one by one, although they are legion, and I grasp each winged gift carefully, tenderly, before tucking it into my flowing white robes.

The first wing is so delicate and made entirely of rose petals, strong-smelling and soft. It represents the support of my family members across the years. I decide that I will write every one of them heartfelt thank you letters first thing when I wake.

The next set of wings are tinted with the colors of dawn - pale pink, amber, blue. They dance around me on the breeze as leaves would flitter. They represent all the memories I've never properly cherished - lazy Sunday afternoons reading in the backyard, summertime campfires watching stars, a calm spring rain gently flooding the park. Each one nods to me as it passes, drawing my gaze down a nostalgic rabbit hole.

A feather lands softly on my collarbone. It belongs to a gull who flew overhead that day last winter when I forgot to appreciate the coals I'd assumed only our dubious Heat-o-Matic zoned space heater could provide. But they did work. They kept my fingertips and toes from literally freezing and falling off in the unheated shack I occupied, that January asbestos and dormer room.
