I am dreaming. wander deeper, heart pounding in tandem with the flutter of my failing light. Each corridor yawns wider, swallowing the last trembling glow from my lantern until the walls themselves fade into blackness. My footsteps echo sharply, too loud and then impossibly muffled, absorbed by the thick, ancient air scented with damp earth and forgotten secrets.

Suddenly, in the oppressive dark, my hand brushes a wall—cold, slick, encrusted with images carved by hands countless centuries ago. I can just feel the raised stone, tracing spirals and symbols whose meaning thrums in my bones but eludes my mind. An odd, musical hum seems to vibrate from deep within the catacomb, resonating through the rock and settling uneasily in my chest.

A distant, almost luminous phosphorescence shimmers just ahead, not from my lamp but from the moss that clings to the stone. It pulses softly, breathing with an ancient rhythm. With every cautious step, the moss’s strange light grows stronger, painting the passages in shifting hues of green and blue. Shadows twist along the walls, suggestive of figures in flowing robes whose faces are lost to time.

Drawn by the light, a sense of urgency propels me. I follow the glowing trail into a vaulted chamber. Here, pillars rise like petrified trees, each entwined with glowing roots. In the center lies an altar, upon which rests a single, shimmering key of impossible design, forged from midnight and starlight. The air trembles, as if the centuries themselves are holding their breath.

As my trembling hand reaches out, my shadow on the stone flickers—no longer alone. All around me, the air rustles with whispers in forgotten tongues, their words curling through the chamber and settling on my shoulders like a shroud. The darkness is no longer empty but populated by ancient memories and spectral guides, urging me to decide: take the key, unlock deeper mysteries, or turn back and let the secrets of the catacombs remain forever entombed.

In that moment, I realize the dream has become not just a journey through ancient stone, but a descent into the hidden places of my own soul, echoing with questions older than memory.
