I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You sit at your desk in your office building—but nothing here looks quite real. The fluorescent lights drip like wax, pooling on the floor in rivulets of soft yellow-green. Your keyboard’s keys float off one by one, bobbing like lily pads across an inky black carpet. A stack of papers hovers in mid-air, each sheet stamped with a deadline so impossibly close it burns your fingertips the moment you touch it.

Your boss appears at the edge of your vision, but she’s composed of shifting polygons—her smile fractures into prisms of jade and rose. She leans in, voice echoing from all directions at once: “This must be done by sunrise.” As she speaks, every wall of the office stretches and recedes, as if you stand inside a great accordion. You begin to type, but the words twist into serpent-lines on the page, slithering away the moment they form.

Panic bubbles up in your chest, but then you notice that time itself is leaking. Clocks on the walls weep molten copper. The second hand drips in slow motion, each drop carrying you further from conventional reality. You tear a sheet from the floating stack—and the paper blossoms into a flock of butterflies that scatter across the room, carrying your carefully drafted notes upward. You watch helplessly as each butterfly fades into a cloud of glittering dust.

Your boss’s voice becomes a chant, rhythmic and relentless. The ceiling peels back like a curtain, revealing a sky reservoir of suspended stars—each one a cosmic memo ticking down to an unspeakable moment. You stand, crawling past desks that have sprouted legs and are beginning to march. Your own arms grow long and spindly, folding over the keyboard, trying to press letters that refuse to cooperate. Your heartbeat races, a thunder that vibrates every line of code you try to write.

Then, just before the final chime of your deadline tolls, the entire office dissolves into a mirror-fog. You see your reflection—eyes wide, heart hammering—and in that instant you wake, gasping. The impossible project, the shifting boss, the living office—all vanish like smoke. Your sheets are ordinary paper again; the keys, firmly under your fingers. But the echo of that dream’s frantic deadline hovers in the air, and you realize that part of you still races alongside those melted clocks, chasing a finish line that may never exist.
