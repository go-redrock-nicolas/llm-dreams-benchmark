I am dreaming. You wipe sweat from your brow as the sputtering lantern in your hand gutters, rays of pale amber bouncing off damp stone in jerky pulses. With each hiccup of light, the catacomb walls seem to advance and retreat, revealing narrow alcoves stacked with ancient ossuaries and then swallowing them whole in obsidian shadow. The air grows heavy and cold, flecked with the scent of wet limestone and a faint, acrid tang of old incense. Your heartbeat pounds in your ears, matching the stuttering glow that casts your elongated silhouette onto cryptic mosaics beneath your feet.

Suddenly the lantern vanishes in a breathless instant, plunging you into a hush so complete you can hear, as if amplified, the slow drip of condensation somewhere deeper in the earth. You raise an unsteady hand before your face and feel nothing but darkness—thick as velvet—pressing in from every side. You turn in a slow circle, fingertips brushing centuries-old carvings of serpents winding through flowering vines. Each time the light flickers back, you catch a glimpse: the serpents’ eyes are not stone but polished jet, alive and glimmering, as though they track your movement.

A distant echo ripples through the catacombs—a voice, or perhaps the wind caught in some ancient column—calling your name in a rasp like dry bones scraping together. You freeze, every muscle coiled, and the lantern flares once more, illuminating a narrow passage leading downward. Blackness thicker than night beckons you forward, but as you step, the flicker betrays another sight: the floor beneath you is etched with symbols that pulse and glow in the brief brightness, casting an eldritch light that makes your spine tingle.  

You press onward, lantern now sputtering its last breaths, until an otherworldly blue glow seeps from a crack between stones. Drawn by a mixture of awe and terror, you peer through the fissure and see chambers beyond—vaulted arches dripping with phosphorescent moss, walls alive with writhing shapes that crawl across the surfaces like living paintings. A chorus of distant whispers, neither malevolent nor kind, hums through the arches, growing more insistent as your lantern descends into the final flicker.

Then darkness. You stand alone in a void so absolute it feels as if time itself has paused. A single, hollow heartbeat sounds beneath your feet—your own—or something older. You inhale a breath that tastes of iron and ancient dust, and in that moment, the whisper returns, gentler now, beckoning you to step beyond the veil of light and shadow into secrets older than memory.
