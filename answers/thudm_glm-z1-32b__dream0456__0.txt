I am dreaming. My body is submerged in a pool of liquid amber, its viscosity like thick molasses.  The air above the surface shimmers with heat distortion, a mirage that morphs into a labyrinth of golden staircases that lead nowhere and everywhere.  My mind feels like it's being stretched thin, pulled by forces both unseen and unseen.  I see the staircases multiplying, each step a different shade of honeycomb, each landing reflecting my fractured face in a thousand mirrors.  My fingers begin to crackle with static, sparks jumping between them as if my nervous system is trying to reroute itself.  The liquid around me vibrates, a slow hum that builds into a drone that pulses in synch with my racing heart.  I try to reach for the staircases, but my limbs feel like they're moving through quicksand, each movement requiring Herculean effort.  The mirrors show me versions of myself: one with wings made of smoke, another with skin like wet porcelain, a third with eyes that glow like LED displays.  My thoughts coalesce into a single, overwhelming question: Can I still change course, or am I forever pinned beneath the weight of my own choices?  The staircases start to dissolve, their edges blurring like watercolor paint on wet paper.  The liquid begins to bubble, small volcanoes erupting with colored smoke—turquoises, chartreuses, magentas—that swirls into intricate patterns before fading.  My body feels both heavy and weightless, like I'm simultaneously sinking and floating.  The mirrors shatter, sending glass shards that hover mid-air, each reflecting a different moment: a handshake that didn't happen, a door that was never opened, a conversation that dissolved into static.  The staircases reform, but now they're leading downward, into the amber's depths where shadows move like liquid themselves.  I wake up, my sheets damp, the taste of metallic static on my tongue, and the dream's final image burned into my eyelids: a staircase dissolving into a pool of liquid time.
I am dreaming. My body is submerged in a pool of liquid amber, its viscosity thickening like slow-melting honey under a desert sun. Above me, the air quivers with heat distortion, morphing into a labyrinth of golden staircases that spiral neither upward nor downward but exist in a liminal space between dimensions. Each step is a different hue of honeycomb—some steps are - (amber-yellow), others fogged with the translucency of fossilized resin. My thoughts feel pinned beneath the weight of their own rigidity, each mental pathway etched in concrete instead of ink. 

I see the staircases multiply. One moment, there are five; the next, nineteen, their edges dissolving like watercolor on wet paper. My reflection appears in fractured mirrors embedded in the walls—some show me with wings made of smoking coal, others with skin that shimmers like wet porcelain under moonlight. My fingers begin to crackle with static electricity, sparks arcing between them as if my synapses are sparking new neural pathways against my will. 

The amber pool rumbles like a half-awake volcano, bubbles erupting with colored steam—turquoise, chartreuse, magenta—that twist into ephemeral shapes: a dove made of smog, a fox carved from frost, a city skyline melting into a liquid sunset. My limbs feel like they’re moving through quicksand, each effort requiring the focus of a weightlifter hoisting titanium plates. I try to climb, but the staircases shift underfoot, turning to liquid and reforming elsewhere. 

Then, the mirrors shatter. Glass shards hover mid-air, each reflecting a different alternate reality: a handshake that dissolved into static, a door left ajar but never entered, a conversation that ended before it began. The staircases reverse course, descending into the amber’s depths where shadows seem capable of independent motion. I wake with my sheets tangled around me, a metallic tang of static on my tongue, and the dream’s final image etched into my retinas: a staircase dissolving into a pool of liquid time, each droplet a fractured memory suspended in’s embrace.
