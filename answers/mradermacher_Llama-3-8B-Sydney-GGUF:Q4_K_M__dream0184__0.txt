I am dreaming. I find myself in a universe where probability operates in reverse—unlikely events occur constantly while certainties rarely manifest. To function in this inverted reality, you must learn to adapt quickly and trust your instincts. 

You wake up in an unfamiliar place, surrounded by strange sounds and smells. You don't know who you are or how you got here. You feel disoriented and scared. You look around and see that you're inside a large room filled with weird machines and glowing screens. You also notice a pair of legs near you that aren't yours. They belong to someone else who is lying on the floor next to you, unconscious or dead.

You stand up and start exploring the room. You discover that it's actually a lab run by scientists who are experimenting on you and other test subjects like yourself—both human and non-human—using advanced technologies such as neural networks and genetic engineering. They want to create new life forms that can do things humans cannot, such as travel through time and space or communicate with alien species.

You realize that your dream has become a nightmare. You decide to escape from the lab before they can harm you further or change you permanently. You search for a way out but find none. You wonder if this is really happening or just another illusion created by your mind.

You hear footsteps approaching behind you. You turn around and see two men dressed in white coats coming toward you. They smile at you ominously, their eyes shining with curiosity and greed. They grab you by the arms and drag you back toward where they first found you—on the operating table where they sliced open your skull and removed your brain.

You struggle against them but it's no use. You scream for help but no one comes to save you. You accept your fate as they prepare to insert something into your head that will transform you forever...
