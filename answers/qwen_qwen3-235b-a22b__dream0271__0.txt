I am dreaming. I stand on the edge of a vast cliff overlooking a fjord carved by time and pain, and before me stretches a narrow, silver bridge of mist—trembling slightly in the wind, spun from morning fog and memory. The bridge leads to a colossal gate, part crystal and partNamesake wood, etched with runes more ancient than time itself. Above the gate floats my lifelong goal—small yet blindingly radiant, like a stardust seed held together by hope, tethered in the air by strands of light.

The path behind me is lit with stepping stones shaped from moments—triumphs and failures so detailed they are practically breathing. A cracked mirror lying on the cliff’s edge glints with moments of isolation, of whispered doubts and long nights where I almost turned back. The wind is thick with the scent of primordial salt, and the low thunder above echoes with anticipation.

I start across the bridge. Each step makes a hollow chime, like a bell ringing out the past version of myself. With each sound, a ghost materializes—echoes of former me’s: the studious child hunched over books, the hopeful young adult chasing impossible stars, the wearied middle aged version who almost gave up by the roadside with dust in their mouth and heartsore fatigue.

These apparitions don’t speak. They are completely still, like statues, trapped in their chosen moments of struggle, and each one meets my gaze with silent reverence, permission, and pleading—*"Finish it."* 

A storm begins to rise with each step I take, and I can hear it raging beneath me—not the chaos of wind but a chorus of voices. My mentors, their advice and warnings layered like sacred mantras. My rivals, their scoffs morphing slowly into low, reluctant encouragement. My family—some gone now, others still distant—calling out in fragmented emotion.

I reach the center of the bridge. A rift opens. Not one born of nature or even magic, but of a paradox—*what if this was all for nothing?*—and from it rears a being, shapeless at first, then taking form. It is the embodiment of fear—not of failing others, but of what I feared to become in that pursuit: an empty epitaph, unrecognized, unmourned, forgotten by the universe.

This being does not attack. It simply *reminds*. It shows me lives I might have lived instead, ones filled with warmth and laughter and children and home and gardens and peace. I feel a deep ache in my chest, the weight of roads not taken, births not witnessed, and dinners never eaten with those I loved.

But I am standing on that bridge because I chose this dream, knew the cost, and made peace with it a thousand lifetimes ago.

I step forward into the fear. As it consumes me, it unravels. Not a monster. Not even a wall. Just a door painted black with all the things too heavy to carry anymore. And so I let them go.

The gate looms now before me. It isn't guarded. It isn’t locked. I stretch out my hand and touch the ancient patterns, and they dissolve like ash in rain, revealing the sky beyond—a sky that isn’t there, because it is *everywhere* and *everything* all at once. Infinite timelines, colliding in a single frame, moments of beauty so intense I nearly weep from their wonder.

And the goal. It falls into my hands—no longer shining, now quiet and warm like a stone held to the sun, or a heart held after a long journey. I close my eyes and feel not triumph, not victory, but… stillness. Completion.

In this dream, I am everything I dreamed of *becoming*. No hollow echo of a wish unfulfilled. Just truth, forged in fire and silence and months of stretching toward the unknown.

And then—I open my eyes. And I wake. Still breathing. Still becoming. Still dreaming.
