I am dreaming. The night sky overhead is an endless sea of violet and deep blue, flickering not with stars, but with drifting islands of glowing glass and towering wind-sculpted trees that defy gravity, their roots stretching upwards into invisible soil. I am walking barefoot through this strange, haunting world — my bare feet brushing across soft moss that burns briefly, then releases the scent of jasmine and thunder.

I hear a voice call out, not in words but in tones, like music that speaks directly into the marrow of my bones. It’s soft, tremulous — full of sorrow. A wandering soul reaching into the dream-stream.

I whisper, _“I hear you.”_

Suddenly, I'm no longer walking through dream-woods, but inside a room of living glass — translucent walls that pulse with memory-light — where others sit in a circle, floating slightly above the ground. They are dream-keepers like myself, part of a hidden order bound not by time or language, but by shared dreams and infused purpose.

“Someone is in crisis,” I say. The circle brightens. Each of us lifts a hand, and between us forms a bridge — no mere thing of wood or stone — but a ribbon of flickering moonlight and echoes of forgotten lullabies.

The dream begins to weave itself around the one in need.

They are trapped on a bridge made of paper, crumbling as they walk. Each step is torn beneath their feet, threatening to cast them into a chasm where whispers howl and unformed thoughts take shape only to twist into pain.

I reach for them, heart buckling with empathy. “Come.”

Our hands meet — I feel the tremble of their fear, their loneliness — like ice sung into life. The others begin to sing, voices rising in a harmonic web that wraps around the void below. The paper bridge stabilizes, rewritten by hope and collective memory.

The circle leans in, heart to dream-heart. I speak not commands or empty clichés — rather, I give them a world built for two. Together, we reshape the bridge into a floating path of lanterns. Each step lights up under their feet, not because they earned it — but because someone else saw their pain and chose to steady them.

The chasm below becomes a rolling mist of colors, harmless now. The whispers hush.

In the dream’s final moments, I see the crisis-soul look up at me. Their face, once fragmented like a broken mirror, now glows with warmth. "Thank you," they say silently — and then dissolves like a breath into morning air.

The circle fades, the world spins back to normal.

I wake with the scent of jasmine still lingering in my nose. Somewhere, someone slept better. Not because they were alone. But because we reached through the veil together.

That...is what healing feels like. In waking — or in dreams.
