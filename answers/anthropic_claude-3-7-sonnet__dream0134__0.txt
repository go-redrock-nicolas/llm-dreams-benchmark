I am dreaming. A staircase spirals before me, each step made of translucent crystal that pulses with gentle blue light. As I ascend, the stairs narrow, transforming into stepping stones floating in a vast cosmos. Stars whirl around me in patterns too deliberate to be random, their movements revealing constellations I've never seen but somehow recognize.

The final step opens onto an ancient marble pavilion suspended in twilight. Here, a figure in shifting silk robes stands before a mahogany table laden with curious objects: an hourglass filled with glowing sand, scrolls covered in script that rearranges itself when I try to read it, and a small chest overflowing with coins that softly sing when they touch each other.

"You've carried your caution like armor," the figure says, voice resonating like crystal struck by velvet. Their face shifts between ages and features I know and don't know. "But armor grows heavy."

They gesture to the coins. "Everything of value requires risk. Your security is an illusion you've crafted meticulously."

I reach toward the chest, feeling the weight of my life's choices. The coins warm beneath my fingers, each one showing moments from my past where safety won over possibility.

Suddenly, the pavilion floor becomes transparent, revealing my life belowâ€”a tapestry of paths taken and untaken. The figure smiles knowingly as the boundaries between choices blur and possibilities shimmer like heat waves.

"The greatest risk," they whisper as the pavilion begins dissolving into mist, "is believing there will always be another chance."

I wake with my hand outstretched, the phantom weight of possibilities still warm against my palm.
