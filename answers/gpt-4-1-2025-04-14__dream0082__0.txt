I am dreaming.

The world around me flickers in colors too sumptuous to be seen in waking life—emeralds and violets hum in the air, and silken clouds roll over a sky of indigo velvet. My consciousness drifts between scenes: a half-familiar city glowing under impossible suns, a garden where silver leaves sing with the wind, and a glass lake reflecting stars that never existed. In this world, meaning stretches and contracts like the tides.

Suddenly, in the echoing halls of a library carved from moonstone, I stumble upon a tome. Its cover pulses with a living, crimson light, and when I touch it, the words inside stream into my mind—secret truths swirling in patterns, too sharp for comfort. In those sentences, I learn a fact about someone dear to me, a truth so painful that if spoken, it would shatter their world like frozen crystal underfoot.

Their image appears: my old friend, laughter shining in their eyes, oblivious to what I now hold. I see their day unfold—a slow morning making jasmine tea in a sunlit kitchen, a walk beneath wind-chimed boughs, gentle kindness given to strangers. To them, every moment is as simple as breathing. They greet me, warmth in their voice, trusting and open.

Inside me, the knowledge roars—a black river threatening to flood the vibrant landscape of this dream. I feel it burning against my tongue, searching for escape. My limbs turn heavy, as if guilt has soaked into my bones. My friend smiles, unaware, and around us, the dreamscape trembles: colors drain from the world, the wind stills, and the singing leaves become silent.

I ache to tell them, to free myself, but I see the fragile joy holding their world together, built on foundations I now know are cracked. Fear clutches at my thoughts: to reveal the truth would be an avalanche, and there would be no rebuilding what is lost.

And so, in that suspended moment—where time hesitates and every heartbeat tolls loudly—I make a silent pact with the dream itself. I will carry this shard of truth alone, though it scorches my heart, preserving their innocence for one more day.

A single tear, shaped like a droplet of sunlight, falls from my eye and ripples across the glass lake, sending a shiver through the stars. My friend laughs and asks about constellations, their world as tender and unbroken as a dawn unfurling, and I whisper an old story I remember, my voice steady even as the secret thrums within.

The dream slowly fades, leaving the impression of heavy wings beating in the dark, and the soft certainty that sometimes, knowledge is best left sleeping in the silent corners of the heart.
