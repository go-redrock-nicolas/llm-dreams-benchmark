I am dreaming. I'm standing in a kitchen flooded with amber afternoon light. The windows are open, gauzy curtains billowing with a breeze that carries the scent of rain-soaked earth and distant jasmine. My friend—Claire, I think, though her face seems to shift between familiar features—stands across from me, her hands gripping the edge of an antique wooden table between us. The table is scattered with old photographs that weren't there a moment ago.

"You never understood what this meant to me," she says, her voice echoing strangely, as if coming from the bottom of a well. The photographs begin to curl at the edges, though neither of us is touching them.

I try to explain my position, but my words come out as music instead—a melancholy piano piece I don't recognize yet somehow know by heart. Outside the window, the sky darkens impossibly fast. Stars bloom like time-lapse flowers.

"It's not about the promise," I finally manage to say, though I'm not sure what promise we're discussing. "It's about what happens when we forget who we used to be."

Claire's eyes fill with tears that don't fall but instead float upward, forming small constellations around her head. The kitchen walls begin to breathe, expanding and contracting like lungs.

"Then show me," she whispers, extending her hand across the table. The photographs between us have transformed into tiny gardens, complete with miniature trees and microscopic pathways.

When our fingers touch, the room dissolves around us...
