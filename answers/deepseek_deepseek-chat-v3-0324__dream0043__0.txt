I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds...**  

You stand in a vast, cathedral-like hall with walls made of shifting geometric patterns—fractals blooming like crystalline flowers, spirals twisting into infinity, and numbers glowing like fireflies trapped in glass. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, vibrating through your bones as though the very universe is whispering equations to you.  

A disembodied voice, neither male nor female but deeply melodic, speaks:  

*"Begin."*  

Suddenly, an enormous hologram materializes before you—a labyrinth of neon-blue pathways, pulsing in rhythmic, hypnotic sequences. Each turn and intersection is marked by a floating symbol: some are numerals, some are hieroglyphs, some are shapes that twist when you blink.  

**First Challenge:** *Remember the path.*  

You focus, etching the route into your mind—left at the theta, right at the golden spiral, straight through the prime sequence. But as soon as you take your first step, the maze reconfigures, walls sliding like liquid mercury. The symbols mutate. A seven becomes a snake; a pi symbol disintegrates into a swarm of fireflies.  

**Second Challenge:** *Calculate as you walk.*  

Numbers now fall like rain from the ceiling, dissolving the moment they touch the ground unless you catch them. You must sum them, multiply them, while still navigating the ever-changing maze. Your mind splits—half focused on memory, half on computation. The air grows thick, syrupy, resisting your every movement.  

*"Faster,"* the voice urges.  

**Third Challenge:** *The maze becomes sentient.*  

The walls ripple as if breathing. Faces press against them—wisps of forgotten mathematicians, philosophers, their eyes glowing with equations you almost recognize. They whisper in overlapping voices:  

*"What is the sum of all regrets?"*  
*"Solve for X, where X is the weight of a shadow."*  

You falter. The floor beneath you liquefies into a black, mirror-like pool. Your reflection grins—*but you aren’t smiling.*  

**Final Challenge:** *Choose: Solve the puzzle, or become part of it.*  

You wake—gasping—heart pounding. The scent of ozone lingers. On your fingertip, a single glowing digit: **7.**  

Or was it always there?
