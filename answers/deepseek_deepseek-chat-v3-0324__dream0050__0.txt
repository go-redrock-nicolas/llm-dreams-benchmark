I am dreaming. The air is thick with the murmurs of hushed laughter and the faint clink of wine glasses, their rims stained with the deep crimson of pomegranate nectar. The room is bathed in an amber glow, cast by candlelight that flickers against walls draped in dark velvet. Faces—familiar to one another but cryptic to me—float into focus, their smiles warm but laced with secrets.  

I’ve been invited here, an outsider folded into a circle woven tight by years of shared glances, unspoken codes, and rituals I don’t yet understand. The woman to my left, draped in silver-shot silk, fingers the edge of her goblet with nails like polished onyx, and when she catches me looking, her lips part in a slow, knowing curve.  

“You’re just in time,” she says, but doesn’t explain.  

Across the room, a man with storm-gray eyes lifts his hand, and the murmuring ceases. The air tightens, charged, as if the room itself is holding its breath. He speaks—not in words, but in a hum that resonates in my bones, a melody rising from deep earth, from the marrow of forgotten things. The others join, voices weaving into a tapestry of sound, and suddenly, I’m not just hearing, but *seeing* the music—ribbons of iridescent light curling between us, binding us together.  

The floor dissolves beneath my feet. I don’t fall—I float, weightless, as the space around us warps into an endless twilight garden. Trees whisper in languages I’ve never heard but somehow understand. Fireflies dart like embers, tracing symbols in the air.  

The woman in silk takes my hand. “Now you belong,” she murmurs.  

And I do. I always have. I always will.  

The dream swallows me whole.
