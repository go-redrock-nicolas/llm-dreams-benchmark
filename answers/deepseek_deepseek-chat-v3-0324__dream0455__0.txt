I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and jasmine, hanging in the twilight like invisible threads of perfume. I stand at the edge of a vast, mirrored lake, its surface so still it reflects not just the bruised-purple sky but the entire world above it—only inverted, shimmering, as if reality has split into parallel realms. The water doesn’t ripple, but I do. My hands tremble as I peel away the armor I didn’t realize I was wearing—thick plates of polished steel, forged from years of swallowed fears and rehearsed strength. They clatter to the ground like falling stars, each impact sending a soft pulse of light across the glassy water.  

And then, the voices come.  

Not from the sky, not from the trees, but from the reflections. My own face in the lake blurs and shifts, becoming the faces of others—those I love, those I’ve shielded myself from, those I feared would see my cracks and turn away. But they don’t. Instead, they reach up, their fingertips breaking the surface, water bending like liquid silk as their hands emerge, warm and solid, to meet mine.  

*"You don’t have to hold it all,"* my mother’s voice sighs through the breeze.  

*"We’ve been waiting,"* murmurs a friend, his reflection smiling in the ripples.  

One by one, the people in my life—my deepest fears, my quietest shames—step out of the mirrored world and into mine, pulling me closer not because I am unbroken, but because I am not. Their hands press against the ache in my chest, the hollow I thought would collapse if exposed. Instead, it blooms. Vines of golden light spiral around us, weaving through our fingers, binding us in a net of shared fragility.  

The lake is no longer a boundary. It’s a threshold.  

And as I wake, the dream lingers like a heartbeat—a silent, shimmering truth: *To be soft is not to be weak. It is to be alive, and to be alive is to be held.*
