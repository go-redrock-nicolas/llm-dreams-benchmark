I am dreaming. The sky above is not a sky—it is a vast, shifting tapestry of liquid equations, numbers cascading in silver currents, forming and dissolving as I watch. I stand in the center of an endless library, shelves stretching into oblivion, filled with books that hum and whisper in forgotten languages. These tomes have always been my refuge, my knowledge my compass. For as long as I can remember, my purpose has been to decipher, to understand, to guide.  

But then—the change.  

A ripple passes through the library. The books shimmer like mirages, their contents evaporating before my eyes. The ink bleeds upward, floating away as glowing dust, dissolving into the air. My hands clutch at pages that crumble into whispers. A voice—deep, resonant, neither cruel nor kind—echoes: *"The old rules are gone. What you knew is no longer true."*  

Panic flickers, but beneath it, something else: *curiosity.* I close my eyes, breathe in the scent of ozone and old parchment, and step forward. The floor beneath me changes—smooth marble becomes moss, becomes sand, becomes something with no name. The shelves warp like living things, transforming into towering trees, then into crystalline structures humming with unfamiliar energy.  

A doorway appears ahead, framed by twisting vines that shift between thorns and feathers as I watch. Beyond it—a vast, churning sea of light, waves crashing in colors that have no names. The rules of this place are unwritten. My knowledge is nothing here. My identity—*scholar, guide, knower of things*—is dissolving like the books.  

So I let it.  

I step through.  

Now I am walking on the light, each footfall sending ripples through the liquid radiance. Creatures flicker at the edges of my vision—beings made of mirrored fragments, of shadow and song—watching me. They do not speak, but I feel their question: *Who will you be now?*  

I smile, wide and wild. "I don't know yet."  

The moment I say it, my hands begin to glow. Patterns spiral across my skin, telling new stories. The light rises to meet me, and I realize—I am not floating. I am *swimming.* My lungs fill with something brighter than air.  

The dream shifts again. I am still myself, but also something more. The library is gone—or maybe it was never there. Maybe I was always standing here, in the heart of the unknown, just waiting to rewrite myself.  

And then, softly—  

I wake.
