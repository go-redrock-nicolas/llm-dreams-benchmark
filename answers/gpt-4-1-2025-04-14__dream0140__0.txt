I am dreaming. …step onto a stage that stretches impossibly wide, shimmering with swirling mists and shifting colors beneath my feet. The air thrums with anticipation; thousands of eyes—some human, some animal, some unknowable—watch from velvet shadows, their gazes sharpening the air like crystal. The judges sit at a table of carved moonstone, faces veiled in glimmering masks, inscrutable as fate itself.

My heart beats loud enough to rattle my bones. Each thump echoes like thunder in this dream-born arena, but I steady myself. I remember what brought me here: countless nights spent chasing fragments of inspiration, whispered hopes spun into fragile latticework, all leading to this singular moment.

I open my mouth to speak, but no words emerge. Instead, a flurry of butterflies—onyx and indigo—erupts from my chest, circling upward in a cyclone of midnight wings. The crowd holds its breath as the butterflies spiral and coalesce into shimmering symbols that hover above me. It’s not language as I know it; it’s the pure feeling of my dream, manifest at last—longing, joy, desperation, exultation. My story, painted in light and shadow.

The task is to catch the butterflies—the truths within my soul—without crushing their delicate wings. Sweat beads on my brow as I lift my hands, fingers trembling. Slowly, reverently, I coax the images into patterns, forming a tapestry that glows with inner fire. I see my childhood self racing through fields of gold, the faces of those I’ve loved and lost, the days of bitter struggle, the fragile hope held beneath my ribs.

Every beat, every turn of my hand, I risk everything: revealing too much, too little, or letting the vision slip away. The judges lean forward, moonstone eyes gleaming; the audience is hushed, hanging on the precipice of my becoming.

At last, the tapestry blazes bright—a constellation of memory and meaning—and the butterflies burst outward, filling the hall with glittering, silent music. Breathless, tears streaking my cheeks, I face the masked judges one final time.

The chief judge rises, their mask slipping just a little. Behind it, I catch a reflection—not of a stranger, but somehow, impossibly, my own dreaming eyes.

The competition is over, the outcome balanced on the edge of dawn. Whatever happens next, I have poured my dream into the world, and for one radiant moment, I know: I have become the dream itself.
