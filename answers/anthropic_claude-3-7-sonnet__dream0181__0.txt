I am dreaming. I stand in a vast circular chamber with walls of shifting opalescent material—neither quite crystal nor liquid. A massive table stretches before me, ancient wood carved with symbols that seem to rearrange themselves when I look away. Faces turn toward me—dozens of them, some human, others distinctly not, their features suggesting depths of wisdom accumulated across centuries.
