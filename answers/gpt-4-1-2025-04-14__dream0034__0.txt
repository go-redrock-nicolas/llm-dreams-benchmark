I am dreaming. swirl bold sapphire strokes across the canvas, a trembling anticipation pulsing through my fingertips. Entire cities ripple into existence from the wet blue, skyscrapers blossoming like crystalline flowers and glimmering beneath a nameless sun. I dab a touch of yellow, feeling a golden warmth radiate outward, transforming time into a living river. The brush whispers across the canvas, and seconds flutter like hummingbirds—backwards, forwards, looping endlessly in delicate arcs.

With a single breath, I splatter crimson across a mountainous horizon and watch the sun set and rise in a chorus of eternal twilight. Each color I lay down doesn’t just fill the empty space; it bends the air, stretches the minutes, reshapes gravity. If I twirl cerulean in a spiral, whole days coalesce and unravel in dizzying waterfalls. A thick, swirling white invites a gentle snowfall, causing silence to settle like velvet and suspend even the falling of tears.

It feels like painting a waking memory: city streets pulse with life and then blur out into a forgotten yesterday. A garden blooms, petals unfurling at impossible speeds, then slows as dew hangs in the air, sparkling in a moment stretched beyond its natural span.

I realize I can step into the canvas. With trembling excitement, I do. The world inside is malleable, a realm where with a wave of my brush I can call old friends long lost, relive childhood laughter, racing as time rushes backwards in painted brushstrokes. I reach for a star and smudge it into a galaxy, painting futures and worlds that never were. 

Here, in this painted dreamscape, art has become a gateway—I am both creator and explorer, wandering through the boundless kaleidoscope of moments that have never existed, all born at the tip of my trembling brush.
