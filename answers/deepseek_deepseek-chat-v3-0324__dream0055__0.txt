I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of spiced lotus blossoms and burnt orange, their fragrance mingling with the low hum of unfamiliar music that seems to resonate from the ancient stone walls themselves. I find myself in a grand plaza paved with luminescent tiles that pulse faintly beneath my bare feet, shifting colors like the belly of a tropical fish.

All around me, the locals move with deliberate grace, their elongated limbs adorned with intricate metallic tattoos that change patterns as they converse. Instead of handshakes or bows, they press their foreheads together, exhaling perfumed mist that coalesces into temporary sculptures above their heads - a language made visible.

My guide (though I don't remember acquiring one) is a being with four violet eyes that blink in alternating patterns. She teaches me the most basic greeting: drawing a circle in the air with my left hand while humming a perfect fifth. When I attempt this, the ground beneath me detaches, becoming a floating disc that carries me gently toward a fountain where the water flows upward, collecting in suspended crystalline bowls.

Nearby, a group celebrates something by slowly unraveling their hair (which appears to be made of liquid mercury) and braiding it together into complex mathematical shapes that hover between them, emanating soft chimes. I feel the inexplicable urge to join, though I know my earthly hair cannot participate in this ceremony. 

The sky above isn't sky at all but a vast, undulating tapestry depicting what I gradually realize are the collective dreams of the entire city, woven from threads of memory and anticipation. When I blink, the images rearrange to include fragments of my own childhood - my first bicycle ride, my grandmother's apple pie - incorporated seamlessly into their alien dreamscape. 

A deep gong sounds from no discernible source, and everyone begins moving toward what looks like an obsidian tree whose branches grow downward into the earth. I understand without words that this is the heart of their social fabric, where connections are renewed by plucking echoes from the roots and sharing them in wordless communion. My floating disc carries me forward, and for a moment that stretches like taffy, I almost remember how to speak this silent language of joined memories.
