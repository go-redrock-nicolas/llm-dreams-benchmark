I am dreaming. You drift through the night, your mind alive with shimmering hues and impossible shapes. In the midst of these ethereal sensations, you find yourself standing at the foot of a massive, gleaming staircase. The marble steps are lined with flickering lanterns suspended in midair, casting trembling shadows that reveal the intricately carved mosaic floors below. Everything around you is larger than life—famed portraits whose subjects shift and wink at you, tall pillars twisted as if spun from liquid silver, and doors of every size, some barely tall enough for a mouse and others towering above your head like a fortress gate.

Suddenly, a hush ripples through the corridor. Dozens of solemn figures step aside, forming an aisle that leads to a pair of colossal bronze doors. A creaking noise resonates as these doors part. Inside is a sumptuous chamber rimmed with velvet drapes and crowned by a domed skylight where constellations swirl like glitter tossed into the cosmos. At the center of the room, a dais topped with an ornate lectern awaits—empty, as if beckoning your arrival. A throng of stern-faced individuals, each draped in billowing academic robes, turn to face you. Their eyes blaze with expectation and skepticism. One of them, wearing a chain of office studded with jewels that glimmer with impossibly shifting colors, steps forward and proclaims: “You have been chosen to lead our most revered institution.”

A collective gasp echoes like a restless tide. You feel your heart pounding with both thrill and dread. You flash back to every anxious hour you’ve spent imagining yourself in a position of leadership—only to recall you never walked the same path, never collected the formal training or accolades your peers possessed. Yet, here you are. The robed assembly stands rigid, their glances brittle and doubtful. You sense their silent challenge: “Prove you deserve this.”

With trembling steps, you climb onto the dais. The platform seems to extend infinitely beneath your feet, as though it’s floating on clouds. You speak, hesitantly at first, your voice echoing around walls cloaked in centuries of wisdom. Words tumble out in an unfamiliar yet strangely certain rhythm. The robed figures shift and fidget—some narrow their eyes, a faint disapproval etched into their faces. Others, compelled by a flicker of curiosity, lean forward, searching your features for signs of fortitude.

As you continue, your voice grows stronger. You share your vision of a new era—an era where imagination and unorthodox thinking are nurtured rather than dismissed. It feels like an unveiling; lights from the suspended lanterns brighten, the mosaic floors sparkle underfoot, and the hush among the grand pillars yields to a hum of cautious anticipation. Slowly, the guarded glances soften; some onlookers begin to nod. You speak of toppling old boundaries and forging unity through compassion and brilliance. You promise to chart a daring path for this revered institution—one that honors its proud heritage but dares to dream beyond the horizon.

In the culmination of your speech, you feel a shifting beneath your feet. The dais glows with a soft luminescence; the swirling constellations overhead intensify their glimmer until they resemble galaxies dancing on glass. A gentle hush returns to the hall, but it’s no longer hostile. It wraps around you like a cloak of cautious acceptance. You exhale, heart pounding, somehow certain that this improbable appointment—this crown without credentials—might just be the beginning of something remarkable. You can almost feel the tapestry of possibility unraveling around you, as the dream dissolves into stardust and you awaken, breathless, yearning to continue leading, yearning to prove that the impossible can be made real.
