I am dreaming. …square my shoulders against the booming wind, plant my boots on the tilting deck, and let the dream unfurl.

The air is the color of hammered violet, bruised and restless. Lightning claws through it in silver zig-zags, lighting the rigging like the bones of some vast, translucent beast. The wheel kicks beneath my palms, slick with brine and wind-driven rain, yet it feels alive—heartbeats thrum up the spokes as though the whole vessel is a single colossal organism and I, its pulse.

“Hold fast!” I shout, and my voice ricochets along the rails. Lanterns swing like frantic fireflies, briefly illuminating faces wide-eyed with fear and trust in equal measure. Every soul aboard believes I can carve a path through this chaos, so I choose to believe it too.

A wall of water rears ahead, pitch-black except for eerie green veins flickering inside it, as if the ocean borrowed lightning from the sky. We are minutes—no, heartbeats—from being swallowed. In that instant, the dream bends; reality’s seams widen.

Time dilates. I taste salt and starlight at once. The storm hushes—sound replaced by a low, melodic hum rolling through the clouds like the singing of distant whales. When the world exhales again, the sky splits, not with thunder but with color: auroras pour down like liquid ribbons—citrine, amethyst, indigo—folding themselves into spinning spires above the mainmast.

“Captain,” murmurs my first mate, eyes glowing with reflected prisms. “What sorcery is this?”

“New wind,” I tell him, though I know it is older than any charted wind. “Trim the sails for wonder.”

Canvas bellies with that impossible breeze, and we shoulder through the oncoming wave. Instead of shattering on us, the wave blossoms under the hull, lifting the ship gently as if the sea has become a great blue hand intent on passing us higher.

Suddenly the water falls away. We are no longer sailing upon the ocean; we are sailing above it. Below, the storm churns in slow motion, a painter’s swirl of cobalt and jade, while we glide along a corridor of calm air. Flocks of luminous gulls circle us, their feathers trailing comet-dust that hisses softly when it lands on deck and disappears.

I guide the wheel toward an opening where clouds yawn apart like ivory gates. Beyond lies a horizon I have never seen—a place where the vault of night bends down to kiss the sea, and the constellations rearrange themselves into new stories. The North Star melts into a spiral of spinning diamonds; Orion tips his jeweled belt in greeting, and then dissolves into a swarm of firefringed arrows that streak ahead, pointing the way.

“Chart that!” I laugh, half-mad with delight. The helmsman frantically sketches, charcoal snapping between frozen fingers, yet every line he draws turns into curling vines of ink that bloom into black roses across the parchment. The map is rewriting itself—landmasses shifting, coastlines breathing like sleeping animals.

A scent rises—orange blossoms mixed with ozone—and I realize blooms are sprouting from the seams in the planks, big as saucers, trembling with rainwater. One opens beside my boot; within it lies a perfect miniature compass whose needle spins, then steadies unerringly toward the core of the auroral road ahead.

The crew is rapt. Rough sailors, scarred and salt-burnt, stand awed as children before a puppet show. “Steady,” I whisper, though the command is meant as much for my thundering heart as for them.

Ahead, the aurora tapers into a tunnel. On its flickering walls, moving silhouettes appear—hints of other ships, other captains long gone. I see galleons carved from glass, junks rigged with silk, submarines shaped like sea dragons. In each flicker I glimpse another self: a version of me in antique armor, one in sky-blue explorer’s garb, one with hair aflame like a comet. All of them keep their wheels steady, beckoning me forward. The tunnel is a cathedral of my possibilities.

We pass under its arch and, with a hush like a held breath finally released, burst into a calm basin of moonlit water so smooth it mirrors the heavens perfectly. There is no up or down—only starlight above and starlight below, a twin universe cupped around the ship.

I let go of the wheel. It no longer fights me. The ship glides to a gentle halt at the center of the basin and waits, sails hanging slack like silent prayers.

Around us, the stars begin to sink, dipping into the water, each one striking the surface with a soft chime, as though the ocean were a crystal bowl. Every star that touches down becomes a lily made of living light, floating toward the hull. They gather until the ship is ringed in a glowing halo.

“Captain,” breathes the first mate, “what now?”

“Now,” I answer, “we listen.”

We fall silent. The wind dies; even the waves forget to breathe. In that stillness rises a symphony of tiny voices, each flower speaking in a note of radiant music. They weave into a chord so pure it squeezes tears from hardened faces.

The lilies sing of an island that can only be found by those who remember it first in a dream. They sing of a cove where memory and possibility cradle one another like twins. They sing that the storm we left behind was only a threshold, a necessary uproar to shake loose our ordinary sight.

I understand: the basin, the lilies, the tunnel of aurora, all are doors stacked within doors. And in dreams, the only key is daring to open them.

I turn to the crew—their eyes shine with star-petaled reflections—and raise my hand. “Who sails farther?”

Every voice, every heart answers in unison, a roar softer than thunder and stronger than any storm: “We do!”

At that declaration, the lilies lift off like lanterns, and their light threads itself into new rigging overhead—strings of constellations tugged into our masts. A breeze rises—warm, cinnamon-scented, coming from the dark between two distant stars. Sails flare open, catching that wind of the impossible, and the ship obeys.

We sail upward—yes, upward—keel slicing pure night. Below, the water becomes a mirror I cannot distinguish from sky, until the concept of below evaporates entirely. We are simply voyaging, boundaryless, on an ocean made of dreaming itself.

As the ship climbs toward a newborn dawn that crackles gold on cosmic horizons, I feel the dream beginning to thin, as though morning’s fingers are prying my eyelids open. Yet before it fades, I press one final command upon the fibers of this reverie, binding it to my waking heart:

Remember the storm. Remember the lilies. Remember that all horizons are doorways when you dare enough to steer through them.

The scene glimmers, trembles, and shatters into a million silent bells of light— 

…and I wake, the taste of salt and starlight still on my lips, fists still curved as though around a living wheel, ready to chart whatever uncharted waters the day might bring.
