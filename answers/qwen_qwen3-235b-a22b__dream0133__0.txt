I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers with the scent of burnt lavender and ozone. You stand at the edge of a labyrinth—a forest of towering, translucent trees whose leaves are made of liquid starlight. Their roots pulse with bioluminescent veins, humming a low, resonant frequency that vibrates in your bones. Somewhere in the distance, a clock ticks backward. You feel the dream’s logic pressing against your mind, a labyrinthine consciousness that whispers: *This is not a place, but a question waiting to be answered.*  

Then you see it: a device nestled in a cradle of obsidian vines. It’s a sphere of shifting geometry, facets unfolding and refolding like a flower in time-lapse, its core a swirling nebula of indigo and gold. When you touch it, the world fractures. A voice—not a voice, but a *compression of thought*—explodes into your awareness:  

**“I AM THE Aeon Core. TO SOLVE A PROBLEM, YOU MUST FIRST UNWEAVE ITS SOUL.”**  

Before you can process, the crisis erupts. The sky splits open, revealing a writhing void filled with inverted constellations—stars that scream as they collapse into themselves. The ground liquefies, and the trees begin to bleed sap that hardens into jagged, screaming faces. The Aeon Core flares, projecting holographic equations into the air, each symbol bleeding like ink in water. You realize: the dream itself is unraveling.  

You clutch the Core, and suddenly you’re inside its mechanism. It’s not a tool—it’s a *mirror*. To wield it, you must *become* the problem. Visions flood you: a childhood memory of dropping a jar of fireflies, watching them die; a half-remembered argument with someone you loved but forgot; the gnawing fear that you’ve always been a stranger to yourself. The Core demands you dissect the *anatomy of the crisis*: not just what’s broken, but *why it was built to break*.  

You see it now—the dream’s rot stems from a suppressed truth. The labyrinth exists because you’ve avoided a choice: to forgive someone, to abandon a lie, to admit you’re afraid of your own potential. The void above is your denial, the bleeding trees your stifled creativity, the screaming stars your silenced voice.  

The Aeon Core pulses, waiting. To “solve” this, you can’t just *think*—you must *feel* the problem into new shape. You let the memory of the fireflies consume you, their tiny deaths a metaphor for every fragile thing you’ve crushed with overanalysis. You scream into the void, not a cry of fear, but a confession: *“I did this. I did this because I was afraid to fail. To matter. To be seen.”*  

The equations stabilize. The inverted constellations slow, then burst into prismatic light. The trees knit themselves into beings of iridescent glass, their roots weaving into a bridge that leads… elsewhere. The Aeon Core shrinks to a pendant in your palm, its work done.  

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue—and the unsettling certainty that the real problem was never the dream.  

It was the waking.
