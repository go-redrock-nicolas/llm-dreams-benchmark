I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of aged parchment and burnt incense.  A thousand eyes peer at me from within the audience—a sea of leathery-fingered scholars, their faces half-hidden behind magnifying glasses and quill pens.  The stage is a labyrinth of moving parts, its gears and pulleys hissing like steam engines from a bygone era.  My task is to decipher a manuscript written in a language that shifts shape like liquid mercury.  The page before me is a canvas of swirling glyphs, their edges dissolving into mist at the corners of my vision.  My hands tremble as I try to steady the quill, its ink a deep, velvety black that seems to swallow the light.  A distant clock tower chimes, and with each toll, the manuscript’s script reconfigures itself, demanding new interpretations.  In the audience, a silver-haired woman adjusts her monocle, her gaze piercing enough to slice through my resolve.  I feel the weight of expectation pressing down, but then, a sudden warmth spreads through my fingertips.  The ink begins to flow with a mind of its own, the letters rearranging into solutions I couldn’t possibly know.  The scholars lean forward, their expressions shifting from skepticism to wonder as the deciphered text pulses with golden light.  The manuscript, now a vessel of ancient knowledge, hums in harmonic resonance with the gears beneath the stage.  I raise the quill, and the audience erupts not with applause but with a chorus of whispered approvals, their breath carrying the faint scent of blooming lotus flowers.  The dream dissolves, leaving me with the aftertaste of ink and possibility.
