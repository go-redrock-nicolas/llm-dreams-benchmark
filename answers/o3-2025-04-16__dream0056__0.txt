I am dreaming. I open my eyes in the hush before dawn and somehow know I am the expedition’s captain, though I can’t recall a single knot-tying lesson or the difference between a topo map and a placemat. Five strangers stand in a loose half-circle around me: a stone-quiet botanist whose glasses flash like silver moons, an elderly violinist in a moth-eaten dinner jacket, a teenager with scarlet hiking boots, an accountant clutching a leather-bound ledger instead of a canteen, and a freckled painter whose fingertips are already stained cobalt. All of us carry mismatched gear that looks borrowed from a museum of forgotten adventures—canvas rucksacks with brass buckles, lanterns that glow like captive fireflies, compasses that spin even when our hands are still.

The wilderness awaiting us is equal parts cathedral and labyrinth. Giant spruce trees bend toward each other overhead, their interwoven crowns forming a vaulted ceiling of emerald glass. Between their roots, the soil is black and glittering, as though mixed with ground onyx. When we breathe, our exhalations rise as shimmering ribbons that soften into faint chimes—each person’s breath a different note, turning the forest into a sleeping orchestra.

We march without a map because the path glimmers in front of us, unspooling like silver filament and vanishing the instant we pass. I feel absurdly certain that if I hesitate the thread will snap, so I pretend confidence and stride onward. My companions follow, trusting me with that quiet, perilous faith you only grant to a dream guide—or a storm-tossed captain you’ve never met in daylight.

Challenge one emerges as the Tanglewood Mire: an ankle-deep swamp where every step triggers a swirl of luminous spores that crumble into miniature lightning bolts. The botanist kneels, studying the spores, murmuring about bioluminescent mycelia. I, fraudulent leader, announce we will walk in each other’s footprints to avoid sinking—something I recall from a long-forgotten nature documentary. It works. The violinist hums a single pure note that keeps time as we pace heel-to-toe across the living lightshow.

Soon the forest floor tilts skyward, becoming a staircase of roots so steep it seems carved for giants. The teenager in scarlet boots giggles, calls it the Escalator of Earth, and springs ahead. We climb into thinning air where clouds drift like slow, deliberate whales. Here, stray memories rain down—polaroids of birthday cakes, half-remembered lullabies, report-card comments, all fluttering like paper snow. The accountant tries to catch a memory of his own childhood, fails, and sobs silently. Instinct tells me not to comfort him with words but with pace, so I lengthen my stride, letting purpose be the rope that hauls us upward.

At the crest, night falls instantaneously, but stars blaze close enough to touch, tethered to the ground by silken threads. The painter dips her brush into starlight and paints invisible sigils across our faces—protection, she whispers. The symbols tingle like fresh snowflakes melting on skin.

We descend into a canyon whose walls pulse with slow, subterranean heartbeats. Abandoned mining carts line the path, filled not with ore but hourglasses turned on their sides, sand frozen in mid-cascade. Time, here, has taken a sabbatical. I feel the void of experience inside me, the yawning gap between actual expertise and this borrowed authority. Yet the strangers still lift their eyes to me. On impulse, I grasp the nearest hourglass. Its glass is warm, and inside the sand begins moving again, steady as surf. One by one, I hand an hourglass to each traveler. “Carry your own time,” I say, and the canyon’s heartbeat slows to a soothing purr.

Our final obstacle is a bridge of pure wind—no planks, no rope, only a ribbon of gale stretching across a chasm that roars like ocean tide dragged through granite. The only way forward is to believe air can be stone. My pulse crashes. The violinist steps beside me and lifts her battered instrument. She plays a tremulous, lingering note that vibrates in my rib cage. The accountant sets his ledger down, opens it, and pages riffle into translucent wings. He rises first, walking on the music, on the numbers, on the faith I pretended into being.

One by one they follow. Last, I inhale until my lungs ache, step into nothing, and find it as firm as marble. The wind holds me like an unseen hand, ushering me across.

On the far side stands a mountain of obsidian that catches the newborn dawn and shatters it into rainbows. We climb the final slope, every stone etched with names I somehow recognize as each traveler’s dream yet to be fulfilled. At the summit, instead of a view, a door made of mirrored ice awaits us. I touch the handle; inside the reflection I glimpse my waking self—someone who doubts, procrastinates, second-guesses. Behind me, the strangers wait, their eyes glowing with whatever they have found in this impossible march.

I open the door.

Brightness floods everything—warm, crimson, like the first drop of sunlight spilling over the edge of the world—and the dream dissolves into the sound of distant applause, or maybe it’s the rush of blood in my ears as I wake, still feeling the phantom solidity of wind beneath my feet and the hush of trees bowing overhead.
