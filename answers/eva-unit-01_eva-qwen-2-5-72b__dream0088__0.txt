I am dreaming. I see in the distance the shadowy figure of a woman. She beckons to me, urging me onward.  

I walk through the valley and into the mountains. The peaks tower above me, the snow-capped tops faintly visible through the swirling mist. My feet tread a winding trail, worn smooth by countless others who've passed this way.

I continue my ascent, each step taking me closer to the summit. Though my legs tire and my breath comes in ragged gasps, I push forward, driven by an inexorable pull towards the woman. The higher I climb, the clearer the air becomes, and with every inhale, I feel my senses heighten.

And then suddenly, I'm there - standing upon the summit. The mists part and I see her standing there.  

She holds out a hand to me and speaks words I do not understand and yet do, for they reverberate within the depths of my soul. There is a knowing between us, a shared understanding that transcends the need for language. A memory of a time before time.

Together we walk through windswept passes, over fields of alpine flowers, and across glaciers as ancient as the dawn of creation. 

And all the while, I am aware of her beside me - a presence both familiar and foreign. There are echoes of a love that once was and might be again.
