I am dreaming. In the dream I find myself standing in an arena, not of stone or metal, but of shimmering, liquid light that flows like silk. The air hums with energy, each breath I take filling my lungs with stardust and the faintest whispers of forgotten languages. The faces of the competitors blur at the edges, their forms shifting between human and something elseâ€”maybe something more. Their eyes glow like supernovae, and when they move, the ground beneath them leaves ripples of bioluminescent patterns. Competitors must partake in a series of trials, each more surreal than the last. The first trial is a dance with shadow and light, where every step must be precise enough to split moonbeams. The second, a silent duel where thoughts are weapons and the mind is the battlefield. The finals, though, are something else entirely... something that bends the rules of reality itself, leaving me questioning what it truly means to win.\
