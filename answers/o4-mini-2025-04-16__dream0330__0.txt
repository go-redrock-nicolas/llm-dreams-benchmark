I am dreaming. You step through a polished jade doorway into a courtyard flooded with lantern-light. The air shimmers with the scent of night-blooming jasmine and spiced honey tea. Statues of twisting, bird-headed deities perch atop columns of carved rosewood. Soft flutes weave through hushed conversation in a language you do not understand, yet each syllable feels alive—vibrating through your chest like a secret heartbeat.  

Your partner appears at your side, dressed in flowing silks embroidered with golden phoenix feathers. Their parents rise from low cushions on the tiled floor. The mother’s eyes are warm, her robes embroidered in the intricate knot-patterns of her seaside village; the father’s robes mimic the iridescent scales of desert lizards. Though you want to bow your head, you’re suddenly guided by a young cousin who gently places your hands into a basin of cool, rose-scented water. You feel the current of this new world swirl around your fingertips—an unspoken welcome ritual, meant to wash away the dust of your own customs.  

A soft gong rings, and a low wooden table appears, laden with crystalline bowls of soups that glow faintly blue, dumplings whispering steam, and slender glasses of luminescent rice wine. Your partner’s grandmother motions with delicate fingers for you to taste each offering in turn, explaining (in rapid, lilting phrases) the legend of every herb and spice. You sip courageously—and suddenly, visions bloom behind your eyelids: crimson cliffs at dawn, a city carved into living trees, a thousand dancers circling a bonfire. When you open your eyes, the grandmother’s smile is wider than before, as though you’ve passed an invisible test.  

Then the courtyard floor seems to swell beneath your feet, petals spiraling up into a rainbow-colored spiral. Dancers emerge from swirling shadows, drumming on shells and singing in harmony with the wind overhead. Your partner urges you to join—hands clasped in a gentle press to your chest, guiding your steps in a dance you’ve never learned. At first you stumble, but soon you match their rhythm, matching the pulse of this family’s heart.  

As the dream reaches its crescendo, lanterns lift themselves into the sky, trailing ribbons of golden light. Your own laughter echoes against the stone arches, mingling with the family’s voices until you cannot tell where you end and they begin. In that glowing moment, you realize that though your traditions may differ, love and respect can weave together a tapestry far richer than any single thread. A final gong sounds, and the dream dissolves into velvet darkness—leaving behind only the warmth of new belonging.
