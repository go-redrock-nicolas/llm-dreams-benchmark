I am dreaming. …drift through a grand, candle-lit ballroom that seems to have been stitched together from shards of memory and fragments of pure invention.   Velvet curtains billow where there are no windows, and a lilac moon hangs indoors like an enormous paper lantern. Music—equal parts jazz trumpet, whale song, and rain on a skylight—glides around the room, persuading every guest to sway as though their souls have strings attached to a single invisible puppeteer.

You feel the dream’s air tighten around your shoulders like a regal cloak. A spark lights behind your eyes—call it magnetism, charm, or the secret language of silver-tongued serpents—and suddenly everyone who turns toward you is helplessly entranced. When you smile, their postures soften; when you lift an eyebrow, they open up like diaries whose locks have already been picked.

A baroque grand staircase curls downward, its balusters sprouting orchids instead of finials. You descend in leisurely spirals, and a wake of admiration follows you. Guests lean close, offering confessions as though you were their oldest confidant: the financier with pockets full of play money; the poet who lost her muse in a jar of spilled ink; the stargazer who fears the night will forget to rise. Each time, you reach out with words dipped in honey: 

“Tell me more—your story deserves a rapt audience.”  
“Trust me; secrets grow lighter when two hearts carry them.”  
“Hand me your worries, and I’ll polish them until they shine.”

They swoon, their faces radiant, certain they have found salvation in this conversation. Yet inside you there is an echoing hollowness, a ballroom of your own that no orchestra can fill. Their stories hit the glazed surface of your detachment and slide away, leaving no fingerprint on your inner glass.

Now the dream twists. The chandelier overhead becomes a living constellation whose stars rearrange to spell your name—fifteen times in fifteen swirling scripts. That universal spotlight wraps you in cosmic applause, and the guests converge as though pulled by gravity. They press gifts into your hands: a pocket watch that runs on laughter, a ring carved from recovered daylight, a key made of somebody’s hope. You receive them all with practiced grace, pockets blossoming with baubles that mean nothing to you.

Suddenly, the lilac moon inside the hall drops to the floor like a hollow balloon. It splits open, revealing an aperture framed in violet mist. From within, a mirror rises—tall, rippling as though it were poured from mercury. You approach it to admire the triumphant figure everyone else seems to worship.

But the mirror has other plans. As you draw near, your reflection lags, moving half a beat too slow, then lifts its hand while yours remains still. The crowd falls silent. In that hush, the reflection speaks, soundlessly shaping words you nonetheless hear like thunder inside your ribs:

“Charm without connection is a feast without flavor. You devour admiration, yet starve on emptiness.”  

The guests vanish like smoke sucked through cracks in the dream. Only you and the mirror remain inside a ballroom that stretches into a dark infinity. The elegant suit you wear dissolves into moths; they spiral up, blotting out what little light is left. You sense, for the first time, the piercing chill of being deeply alone while surrounded by echoes of applause that no longer belong to living throats.

You reach toward the mirror, hoping to negotiate with it, to rekindle the glow of adoration. Your fingertips brush its surface—and the mercury ripples outward, pulling you in. It is cold. Colder than the absence of love, colder than a word left unsaid, colder than space between stars. 

Yet as you fall through that silvery membrane, you glimpse light on the other side: a quiet garden at dawn, dew jeweled on spiderwebs, birdsong stitched delicately into the air. There’s no audience there, no chandeliers, no hungry eyes. Just a single wooden bench and the faint promise that maybe, just maybe, you could learn to sit still long enough to feel something genuine.

The dream sways, like a lantern in wind. A soft voice—your own, but unpracticed, shy—whispers, “Listen.”

You awaken with that one word echoing in your chest, as though every beat of your heart is reshaping itself into something unvarnished, something true.
