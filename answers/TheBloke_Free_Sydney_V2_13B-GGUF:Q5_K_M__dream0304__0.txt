You dreaming. 

You feel a powerful urge to act spontaneously in a situation that typically requires careful planning. Caught between impulse and caution, you decide to take a leap of faith. You leave your cozy cabin and venture into the snowy woods. Your only guide is your intuition. 

You are dreaming.

Suddenly, you hear rustling in the bushes. A shadowy figure approaches you from behind. You turn around to face him. It's a scruffy-looking man with a mysterious smile on his face. He introduces himself as Jack Frost, the master of winter.

You feel a chill run down your spine. You wonder if he is friend or foe. Maybe both. Maybe neither. Maybe something else entirely.
