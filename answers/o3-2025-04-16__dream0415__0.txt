I am dreaming. …draw your next breath and feel the floor beneath you melt into a pool of rippling starlight. You stand ankle-deep in it, silver currents licking your skin like cool silk, while a hushed semicircle of dream-figures waits for you to speak. Their faces glow faintly—as though back-lit by lanterns hidden behind their eyes—but every countenance is blurred, unfinished, as if the painter left them a heartbeat before completion. They lean in, an eager tide, and you sense an unspoken demand: Tell us the secret core of who you are.

Your pulse flutters. Somewhere, a clock you cannot see beats like a giant heart, the tick amplified in the hush—tick, tock—each stroke an accusation that you’re taking too long. A crystalline podium rises from the starlit liquid, glittering with facets that reflect your own uncertainty in countless fragments. You touch it; it hums, a tuning fork struck against the universe, vibrating right through your sternum.

The dream-figures begin to murmur. Their voices braid together, silk and gravel, wind and water, coaxing you forward: “Your story, please. Strip it down. Give us everything.”  

Panic flickers—hot, metallic, the taste of ozone on your tongue—but then another sensation blooms, light as the wingbeat of a hummingbird: curiosity. What if vulnerability is a palette, and you can choose the pigments? What if disclosure isn’t baring the marrow but painting the room in metaphors you alone command?

You lift your hands. The podium splinters into fireflies that scatter upward, lighting the vaulted air like golden snow. Gasps twine through the circle. Where words should tumble out, you exhale color: a slow ribbon of deep cerulean drifts from your lips, unfurling into the shape of a wide river under moonlight. On its mirror-smooth surface float half-remembered houses, each window pulsing with the glow of private rooms. You do not open the doors. You simply let the audience see the river pass—proof that the houses exist, yet their thresholds remain yours alone.

Some of the dream-figures press closer, greedy for more. One stretches an elongated arm toward the nearest house. Instantly the river folds into origami cranes that wheel upward, their wings beating a hush so profound it drowns every whisper. The grasping hand recoils. Respect glimmers where hunger once lurked.

Now you shape syllables like glass bells. You do not reveal the name of your first heartbreak, but you describe the color of the sky the morning it happened—a bruise-purple dawn dissolving into tangerine hope. You do not list every childhood fear, but you evoke the scent of petrichor in a summer alley where you first discovered bravery, barefoot on wet pavement. Each image is true, intimate, yet it is story rather than confession—prism rather than mirror.

The circle’s glow softens. Faces that were blank gain gentle contours: a freckle here, a shy smile there. They nod, pausing in their collective thirst, as if realizing that what you’ve given them is not less but different—rich, resonant, respectfully veiled.

Finally you lower your hands. The cranes dissolve back into motes that rain down like warm snow, extinguishing themselves on the silver pool. The podium never returns; instead, a single lily blossoms where it once stood, petals carved from moonlight. The dream-figures step back, murmuring assent, satisfied, perhaps even moved.

You turn from them. With each step, the pool rises to meet your soles, lifting you toward a distant archway of dawn-white fire. Beyond it, a new dream beckons. You walk on, custodian of your own myth, the houses safe along their hidden riverbanks, yet the sky above ablaze with colors shared.
