I am dreaming. I am in a world where my creativity can flourish without bounds.  I see colors and shapes that mesmerize me.  I hear sounds that transport me to different realms.  I feel emotions that consume me and set me free.
I discover that I have developed an intuitive approach to problem solving that contradicts established methodology but produces superior results.  I trust my unconventional process because it works for me.
