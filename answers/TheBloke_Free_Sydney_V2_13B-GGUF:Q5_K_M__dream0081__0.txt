I am dreaming. You are an astronaut on a spacewalk outside of your spaceship when suddenly alien life forms attack and kill crew members. With danger lurking everywhere and your fear growing, you make the life-changing decision to abandon ship by launching yourself into deep space with only a small jetpack strapped to your back. As you soar through darkness towards an unknown destination, new emotions emerge within you that you never knew existed before.
