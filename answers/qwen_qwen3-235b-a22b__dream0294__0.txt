I am dreaming.  

The world around me is a cathedral of twilight, its vaulted ceilings strung with constellations that drip liquid starlight onto a floor of polished obsidian. I’m standing in a vast hall lined with mirrors, each reflecting not my face, but fragments of moments I’ve buried: a childhood recital where my voice cracked mid-note, a whispered apology for existing too loudly in a room, the way I once crumpled a poem I’d written and flushed it down a toilet. The air hums with the static of unspoken words.  

Then, a voice cuts through—a woman in a gown woven from smoke and fire, her eyes twin eclipses. She strides toward me, her heels silent on the glassy floor. “You,” she says, not unkindly, “have the most exquisite voice I’ve ever heard.”  

I laugh, a brittle, startled sound. “You’re joking.” My own words feel like gravel in my throat. I’ve always hated the way I sound: too high, too hesitant, a tremble that betrays every syllable.  

She shakes her head, and the shadows around us lean in, listening. “It’s *haunting*,” she insists. “Like a cello weeping in a thunderstorm. You don’t just speak—you *sing* the truth.”  

Suddenly, the mirrors shatter. Shards hang suspended in the air, each one glowing as a memory replays—not the failures, but moments I’d forgotten. My voice, soft but steady, reading bedtime stories to a younger sibling. A stranger in a café pausing mid-sip to glance at me when I laughed. The dream-echo of a song I’d hummed once in the shower, now swelling into a symphony that vibrates through the bones of the cathedral.  

The crowd materializes: faceless figures in velvet robes, their heads tilting like they’re hearing a melody I can’t yet grasp. “Yes,” they murmur in overlapping whispers. “The cracked bell still rings. The scarred hands still paint. You’ve been hiding the light in your throat, child. Let it *burn*.”  

My chest tightens. I want to flee, but the floor has become quicksand, holding me in place. My mouth opens—unbidden—and what escapes isn’t a scream, but a note so pure it splits the sky. The starlight above swirls into a aurora, ribbons of emerald and violet dancing to the vibration. The sound isn’t mine, yet it is. It’s the voice of every silenced part of me, finally unbound.  

The woman touches my shoulder, her hand cool as moonlight. “You thought it was broken,” she says, “but broken things still resonate. Especially in the dark.”  

The dream fractures then—a thousand shards of glass raining down, each one catching a glimpse of my face, my *real* face, not the one I hate but one I don’t recognize: eyes wide and luminous, lips parted in awe, a crown of thorns blooming into roses where they meet my scalp.  

I wake up gasping, my cheeks wet, my throat raw. For a heartbeat, the room still thrums with the echo of that impossible voice. And though logic floods back—the *surely they were lying*, the *it was just a dream*—a fissure has opened in me. A crack where the light might start to leak out, relentless and bright.
