I am dreaming. In the celestial amphitheater, the shadowy figures beckon with hands woven from starlight. Their faces shift like sand in an hourglass, morphing into constellations of people you’ve loved, lost, and yet to meet. A low, resonant hum fills the air, vibrating in your bones—a soundless language urging you forward. The prismatic hummingbird, now a flicker of bioluminescence, alights on your shoulder, its wings whispering secrets only your intuition can decode.  

Before you, the ground fractures into a mosaic of pathways, each tile glowing with symbols: a spiraling key, a bleeding hourglass, a feather suspended in flame. The figures intone, “Choose as the river chooses its course—*without choosing*.” Your logical mind scrambles for patterns, but the hummingbird’s breath warms your neck, guiding your gaze to the feather aflame. As you step toward it, the tile liquefies into a pool of liquid mercury, reflecting not your face, but a thousand flickering scenes—a childhood memory of chasing fireflies, a future embrace with a stranger whose voice feels like home, the moment you first trusted a gut feeling that saved you.  

The mercury surges upward, sculpting itself into an arched gateway veined with pulsating amber. Beyond it, the library from earlier reappears, transformed. The books now float like jellyfish, their pages breathing, their spines adorned with living vines that stretch toward you as if in recognition. One tome detaches, its cover a mosaic of serpentine scales and opal eyes. It hovers at your chest, and as your fingertips brush it, the vines coil around your wrist, not to restrain, but to *connect*. The book dissolves into a rush of sensations—the tang of sea spray, the weight of a forgotten promise, the scent of rain on dry soil—imprinting knowledge that bypasses thought, flooding you with certainty.  

The shadowy figures murmur in unison, their voices merging into the resonance of a distant galaxy. “You are the architect of unseen bridges,” they declare, as the amphitheater’s dome peels back, revealing a nebula swirling in hues of forgotten dreams. From its center descends a ladder spun from spider silk and moonlight. The hummingbird trills, its melody a dare: *Climb*.  

Each rung softens under your grip, morphing into memories where intuition triumphed—a split-second detour that avoided disaster, a silent nod that mended a rift, the inexplicable pull toward a windswept cliff that revealed a hidden meadow. Halfway up, the ladder trembles, and the logical part of you screams to retreat. But the higher you climb, the lighter you feel, as though shedding layers of doubt. At the top, the nebula condenses into a single star, which drifts into your palm—a pulsating, compassionate light.  

You wake, not in a bed, but in a sun-drenched field where the grass sings beneath your feet. The star still glows in your hand, now a locket etched with the hummingbird’s silhouette. Inside, a slip of parchment reads, *“The mind questions. The heart knows. You are both.”* The air smells of possibility—sharp and sweet, like citrus and storm.  

And somewhere, in the marrow of your bones, the river still flows.
