I am dreaming. I am flying through the air, over vast landscapes and towering cities.  I can see everything clearly, as if it were real.  I can hear everything distinctly,
as if it were next to me.  I can feel everything intensely, as if it were part of me.
I know that this is not real.  I know that this is just my mind creating images and sounds and sensations for me to experience.  But I don't care.  I don't want it to be
real.  I want it to be realer than real.
I see a group of people who are struggling with some problem or difficulty.  They are arguing and fighting among themselves.  They are sad and mad and scared.  They are
powerless and helpless.
But then I see you, who is standing apart from them all.  You are calm and confident.  You are wise and strong.  You are beautiful and perfect.
You smile at me, and I feel a surge of emotion that I can't name.  You wave your hand, and a solution appears out of thin air that solves all their problems and makes
their lives better.
You say something to me in a language that I don't know but understand perfectly.  You tell me about yourself and what you want and why you're here.
I wake up feeling elated and curious and hungry for more.
