I am dreaming. I find myself in a glass-walled room, the walls pulsing with a deep crimson glow that matches the rhythm of my heartbeat. All around me, delicate crystal vases line shelves that seem to float in mid-air. Inside each vase is a tiny flame, dancing and flickering - some burn bright orange, others a muted blue, but one particular vase holds a flame that burns an intense, almost black red.

As I move closer to this vase, I notice my reflection multiplied infinitely in the glass walls. Each reflection shows a different expression - some smiling peacefully, others contorted in rage, creating a kaleidoscope of emotional states. The crimson pulse grows stronger, and I feel a pressure building in my chest.

Suddenly, the black-red flame leaps from its vase, transforming into a magnificent phoenix. But instead of burning things around it, its fire begins to melt away layers of invisible ice I hadn't realized were encasing my body. Each drop of melted ice hits the floor with a musical note, creating a haunting melody that resonates through the space.

The phoenix circles me, its wings leaving trails of gentle warmth rather than destructive heat. With each pass, I feel the rigid control I've maintained starting to soften. The walls of the room begin to breathe like living tissue, expanding and contracting with each emotion that surfaces.

In the dream, I realize that these flames aren't threatening to destroy - they're offering transformation. The phoenix settles on my shoulder, and I understand that anger isn't a force to be caged but a current of energy that can flow through me without consuming me. The room slowly fills with a soft, golden light as the crimson pulse gentles into a steady, comfortable glow.

The crystal vases begin to sing in harmony, their notes carrying messages about balance and acceptance. As the dream fades, the phoenix dissolves into thousands of tiny sparks that sink into my skin, leaving behind a warmth that feels like courage and understanding rather than rage.

I'm left with the profound sensation that anger isn't an enemy to be suppressed but a part of my inner landscape that needs acknowledgment and gentle guidance, like a wild river that can either flood destructively or be channeled to nourish the land.
