I am dreaming.

The pressure wraps around me like an electric storm, pulsing through every fiber of my mind. I'm standing—barefoot—on the highest ledge of a twilight city, the air humming with anticipation. Below, five sprawling avenues spiral outward, each gleaming with impossible colors and vanishing into fathomless mist. Each avenue is alive, and at their unseen ends, destiny waits.

I hold in my right hand a crystalline heart, warm and thrumming. Behind me, a titanic golden clock counts backward in jarring, uneven ticks. The first task: I must return the heart to its rightful owner before the last chime, else they fade from existence. At the same time, I see on the avenue to my left, a river of music flowing uphill, carrying voices wrapped around silver fish. I must pluck the truest note from the air, or the song of joy will vanish for everyone, forever.

My left hand is suddenly encased in a velvet glove, heavy with invisible ink. I have to write the true name of a forgotten star onto a parchment made of midnight air—if I fail, the night sky will stay silent and empty for all eternity.  

At the center of the city, a tree grows upside down, its roots splitting apart the stones of the earth, drinking the dreams of everyone sleeping tonight. Its branches writhe with faces—friends, strangers, old lovers. I must whisper a secret into the bark, the one secret I've never revealed, and if I lie, the roots will wither and everyone will wake without dreams, their hearts hollow.

The last task burns brightest—across the highest wire strung between two distant spires, a child balances, carrying a lantern filled with starlight. Every moment, wind threatens to pull them down. If my hope flickers, if I doubt for even a heartbeat, darkness will swallow the sun and the world will forget what dawn ever felt like.

The pressure mounts—the city holds its breath. I run, leap, sing, write, confess, and believe, all at once. It feels as if I might shatter, every nerve caught on the edge of catastrophe, but something within me refuses to break. The heart glows brighter, music swells, the ink flows, the tree pulses with hope, and on the wire, the child's lantern bursts with golden fire.

In that breathless, impossible convergence, time folds in on itself. I am suspended, not just one person, but every version of myself that dared to try, all our choices woven together. The world shifts, shimmering—five critical fates hang in delicate balance, and I wake with my hands still tingling, heart pounding, the taste of possibility still bright on my tongue.
