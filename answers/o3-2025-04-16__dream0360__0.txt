I am dreaming. …open your eyes inside the dream and find that you are standing on a narrow footbridge suspended above a forest of softly-glowing glass trees. Each trunk is transparent, yet inside every one floats a frozen memory—tiny scenes from every relationship you have ever had, flickering like fireflies trapped in crystal. Windless air presses against your skin; the bridge barely sways, as though gravity itself is holding its breath to see what you’ll do next.

You step forward, the wooden planks humming underfoot. Ahead, a gate appears—wrought iron, ornate, twisting into shapes that resemble both locks and keys. The gate is hinged to nothing, simply guarding a patch of mist. A plaque on the gate reads, “Projection Crossing: Declare what is yours and what is not.” As you touch the latch, the mist parts and you are drawn through.

Now you are in a candlelit ballroom with no ceiling. Stars hang like chandeliers, their silver filaments dripping starlight that evaporates before touching the polished obsidian floor. Figures swirl past in slow motion, partners in timeless waltzes. No faces are visible—each dancer wears a shifting mask that slides from one identity to another: friend, ex-lover, coworker, parent, stranger. You realize with a start that every mask is a fragment of someone you know, stitched together with the fine thread of memory and assumption.  

One dancer glides toward you. For half a heartbeat the mask is the tender smile of an old partner who once broke your trust; then it flickers and becomes the gentle, curious expression of the person you’re dating now. Your gut clenches—there it is, the unconscious past trying to paint itself onto the present. A century-old string quartet toward the far wall slurs its notes, as if the musicians, too, struggle under the weight of repetition.

You raise your hand. In your palm a glowing quill appears, feathered with flickering aurora. Its nib scratches mid-air, etching words of pure light: “I see the overlay. I choose the true face.” The spelled letters drift like embers before melting into the dancer’s mask. The mask splits, crumbles into origami petals, and the person beneath is suddenly, beautifully unknown—free to be themselves rather than a canvas for your history.

The other dancers pause. Every masked face turns toward you, inquisitive, waiting to see whether you will free them too. You breathe deep and speak, and your voice is both thunder and lullaby: “What belongs to the past returns to the past. What belongs to now may reveal itself unencumbered.” The floor ripples outward, a black mirror stirring to these words. Each dancer’s mask cracks, dissolving upward into constellations that rejoin the star-strewn sky. As the masks vanish, you recognize none of the unveiled faces, yet feel an almost electric relief: every person is suddenly, gloriously unfamiliar—alive with possibility rather than predetermined storylines.

The quartet resumes, now in a fresh key—hopeful, lilting, innocent. A single violinist steps forward and offers you the bow. You accept. The bow transforms into a compass of warm brass and rose-quartz, its needle spinning. When it settles, it points toward a tall set of double doors at the ballroom’s edge—doors that were never there until this moment of clarity.

You walk, and as you pass the quartet they bow their heads in tribute. The doors open onto a moonlit shoreline. Waves made of liquid starlight lap at black-sand beaches, their foam sketching fleeting equations in luminescence. Above, auroras dance like colossal paintbrush strokes. You kneel, hold the compass over the shining water, and watch the brass needle swing steadily toward your chest—toward the quiet certainty inside you that knows the difference between memory and perception.

With that knowing, you stand. The shoreline, the ballroom, the glass forest begin to fade, not collapsing but calmly retreating as though they have served their purpose. You realize you are carrying nothing except the compass—and even that, as you look again, has dissolved into a single point of light now embedded in your sternum.

You close your dream-eyes, exhale, and whisper, “May I see what is here, not what was.” The words ripple out like rings on water, and the dream itself bows to your intention. Everything dissolves into a dawn-gold horizon, warm and indescribably new.

And then—still in the soft twilight between sleep and waking—you sense that tomorrow, when real faces greet you, they will be shining through their own first light, unshadowed by ghosts you have already released to the stars.
