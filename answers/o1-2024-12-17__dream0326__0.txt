I am dreaming. You realize you’re asleep the moment the velvety sky overhead shimmers like ocean waves. Each star blinks in and out of existence with every one of your heartbeats. Something deeply important thrums within your chest—an urgent message, an unspeakable truth. You step forward across what should have been empty air, but your feet land on invisible steps instead—floating, transparent staircases branching in every direction like a glass labyrinth in the infinite night.

At the first landing, you try to speak, but your voice emerges in warped echoes, as though your words are melting before they leave your lips. Shapes gather around you in a half-circle. They could be people—family, friends, strangers—yet their outlines glimmer and shift like heated metal. You sense their curiosity, feel their longing to understand, but something about your precious message flickers inside you, refusing to be molded into words that could cross the vast distance between souls.

A swirl of sapphire-blue smoke rises around you, a shimmering mist that transforms into a flock of feathered serpents. They fly overhead, each creature a living swirl of cosmic color. Their scales reflect your desperate feelings—blazing turquoise for yearning, sunset red for frustration, violet for hope. You reach out, capturing words in your palm as if they’re bubbles shimmering with your message, but the bubbles pop silently one by one. The serpents shriek and vanish into the star-speckled void.

A hush settles. The sky waves are replaced by a liquid darkness that pulses with your heartbeat. You feel your hands trembling, needing to somehow bridge the chasm of understanding. But the shapes drift back, their eyes kind. You try to sing, channeling the urgency in your chest through melody. Small sparks fly out of your mouth—tiny neon lights that coalesce into a living script waltzing across the air. Bursting with hope, you watch as the shapes tilt their heads, reading and humming in harmony with your tune. At last, comprehension dawns in their eyes, bright and crystalline like new stars. They step forward and gently place their hands on your outstretched arms. In that instant, you sense your message pass from your racing heart into their understanding. Joy surges like a lightning storm through your veins.

Then, just as they beckon you to follow them deeper into this starlit domain, you gasp awake—heart pounding, voice echoing with the resonance of truths left unspoken, yet finally grasped.
