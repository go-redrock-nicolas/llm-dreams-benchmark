I am dreaming. You discover that a long-held belief about relationships has been limiting your ability to connect authentically. Challenging this relational assumption, you become aware of the power of vulnerability and courage in building meaningful connections with others. You decide to embrace these values and test them out by breaking one of your rules. 

You wake up and find yourself lying on a bed next to another person who is also asleep. You feel excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.
