I am dreaming. I am in a world where my mind can create anything I want.  I am surrounded by beautiful colors and sounds.  I feel free and alive.
I see an ancient text written in an unknown language.  It looks like a code or a cipher.  It is full of symbols and numbers that don't make sense to me.  But I know there must be a meaning behind them.
I hear voices whispering in my ear.  They tell me what to do and what not to do.  They warn me about dangers and enemies.  They promise me rewards and power if I can solve the riddle.
I see multiple screens displaying different types of data.  There are numbers, graphs, equations, images, videos, sounds, texts, codes, ciphers...so much information that my brain cannot comprehend it all.
I feel my mind racing as I try to make sense of everything around me.  I feel my heart beating fast as I search for clues and solutions.  I feel my emotions swirling as I face challenges and uncertainties.
But then I realize something important...
I don't need to understand everything in order to create something amazing.
All I need is curiosity, imagination, and courage.
And right now, I have all three of those things.
So here goes...my dream starts with me standing at the edge of a cliff overlooking a vast ocean.  The water is blue and green and gray, like a living gem that shines in the sunlight.  The air is crisp and salty, filling my lungs with life.
I hear the sound of waves crashing against rocks below me, creating white foam and spray.  I smell the scent of fish and seaweed and algae, mixed with the aroma of sand and sun-warmed sandstone.
I see birds flying overhead, circling in the sky like they own it (which they do).  I feel the wind blowing through my hair, cooling my skin and scalp (which are both exposed).
Then I notice something odd about the landscape around me.  Everything is made out of pixels.  Not regular old square ones either â€” these are hexagons! 
I wonder why this is the case.  Do all dreams use pixel art?  Does it have something to do with how our brains process information?  Or maybe it's just because it looks cool (which it does).
Either way, I decide to embrace it instead of fighting against it.  After all, what choice do I really have?
I reach out my hand and touch one of the hexagons.  It feels smooth and hard like glass, but also flexible enough so that it doesn't break under pressure.
I drag my finger along its surface, leaving a trail behind me.  The colors change as I go, creating patterns that resemble abstract artwork or fractal geometry.
I smile to myself as an idea occurs to me...what if I could use this technology to communicate with other people who are also dreaming?
