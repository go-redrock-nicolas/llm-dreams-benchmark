I am dreaming. I find myself in a grand, hollowed-out tree, its bark peeling in cascades like ancient parchment. The air smells of wet soil and polished wood. My feet sink slightly into moss beneath a floor that glows faintly, a bioluminescent carpet that pulses in time with my heartbeat, each beat sending ripples of cerulean light outward. I’m wearing a cloak, its fabric fluid as smoke, shifting colors with every breath I take. It feels alive.

Around me, activists from the future gather: time travelers in tattered armor, their skin shimmering like mother-of-pearl. They hold pans, spoons, and measuring cups, using them like ritual tools. They chant in a language that tastes like cinnamon and regret. Their leader, a woman with hair like solar flares, speaks first. “You must confront the Red Abominator,” she says, pointing her wooden spoon at a door, pulsating like a wound.

I approach it, the cloak trailing.. Opening it reveals a labyrinthine market alive with paradoxes. Clocks cascade down walls, chiming in dissonant frequencies. Vendors sell memories: a woman offers my childhood fears in a jar,ebxanging for my present anxieties; another peddles liquid courage in a cracked teacup. Shadows whisper my insecurities in voices I recognize—my mother, father, old flames. 

At the center is the Red Abominator—my younger self, face smudged with tears, clutching a diary. Their voice splinters my name. They accuse me of stifling their creativity, their laughter, everything that makes them human. Their words manifest as black flora, choking the market’s arteries. I notice a mirror the tree’s core connected. It shows my reflection but also my future selves. 

The ground quakes. Vendors flee as the Abominator grows, now towering, red skin bubbling with unspoken fears. My cloak merges with a vendor’s offering—a jar of tears, converting into a prism. I hold it, and the light fractures into colors that silence the shadows. Light wraps around my younger self, dissolving the black plants. 

The Abominator retreats, and the market crumbles. I wake, the cloak now a scarab resting on my chest, still warm.\n
