I am dreaming. I find myself behind the wheel of a vibrant red sports car, its engine purring with barely contained power.  To my left, the sun is setting over the ocean, setting the waves aflame with hues of orange and red.  The road I'm on hugs the coastline, winding up and down the rugged cliffs.  The air is fresh and crisp, and I feel alive, connected to the car, the road and the beautiful scenery all around me.  As I crest a hill, the road steepens, and I find myself accelerating quickly.  The car feels eager to go faster, but as I press the brake pedal to slow down, nothing happens.  The pedal goes limp under my foot, and I realize with mounting horror that the brakes have failed.  

Clenching the steering wheel tightly, I start to look for a way out of the situation.  Ahead of me, a line of slower moving cars blocks my path, and to the right, a guardrail is the only thing standing between me and a sheer drop into the churning waters below.  The road continues to twist and turn as my speed continues to climb.  I start to feel the first hints of panic as the distance between myself and the traffic ahead shrinks rapidly.  Just as I'm starting to think I'm out of options, I notice a small dirt path leading away from the road and up into the hills.  Without hesitation, I yank the wheel hard to the left and the car responds instantly, tires screeching as I leave the pavement and head off-road.

The car bounces and shakes as it tackles the uneven terrain, but it's handling the abuse admirably.  Soon though, the terrain becomes too much, and I can feel the car slowing down rapidly, until finally, it lurches to a stop in a cloud of dust.  Breathing heavily, I release my white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel and let out a sigh of relief.  Outside the car, the last rays of the setting sun paint the sky in a breathtaking array of colors.  I step out of the vehicle and take in the serene beauty of the moment, reveling in the fact that I'm alive and unhurt.  I know that I'm dreaming, but the feelings of exhilaration and fear are as real to me as the cool breeze that's now blowing through my hair.  It's a moment I'll remember long after I wake up.
