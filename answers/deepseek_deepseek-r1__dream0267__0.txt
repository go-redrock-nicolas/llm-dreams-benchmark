I am dreaming. Okay, the user wants me to describe a vivid dream where I caused harm but feel no guilt. Let's start by setting a surreal and intense atmosphere. Maybe a place that's both beautiful and unsettling. Floating islands with mirror-like surfaces could symbolize reflection without emotion. The rain reflecting iridescent colors adds an otherworldly touch.

The protagonist should take an action that's extreme, like cutting a bridge. Wait, cutting a bridge made of glass with a feather pen? That's unexpected and creates a sense of fragility. The collapse in slow motion emphasizes the destructiveness, making the lack of guilt more jarring.

Next, what's the effect on the others? People attached to the bridge with glowing threads. Their panic contrasts with the protagonist's calmness. Adding a guardian with animal eyes introduces a moral element, but the protagonist's indifference challenges that. Using imagery like humming voice resonating with the air shows a disconnect from reality.

The landscape changing to scar-like cracks reinforces the damage. The protagonist transforming into something unearthly, like diamond skin and star-like eyes, highlights their detached nature. The last line about ordinary feelings implies that in the dream logic, being monstrous feels normal. I need to make sure the imagery is consistent and the emotions are starkly contrasted. Let me check for any inconsistencies and enhance the surreal elements further.

Your shadow stretches long and liquid across a bridge of shattered glass, each shard reflecting a different version of yourself—some laughing, some weeping, all silent. The air hums with the static of a storm that never breaks, and the sky is the color of a bruise, purpling at the edges. Below you, a river of mercury flows backward, its surface alive with faces trapped mid-scream, their mouths distorted into black voids. You don’t look down. Instead, you focus on the blade in your hand: a feather plucked from a bird you don’t remember killing, its edge sharper than regret.

You kneel and carve your name into the bridge’s spine. The glass screams as you etch, splintering fissures that spiderweb outward like veins. The collapse is slow, deliberate. Arches crumble into silver dust. A chorus of cracking fills the air, harmonizing with the hum of the storm. You watch as people—faceless, weightless—plunge into the mercury below, their bodies dissolving into smoke that curls upward, forming new constellations you’ll later mistake for stars. 

A figure emerges from the wreckage. Their skin is parchment, etched with runes that bleed black ink. They reach for you, but their hands pass through your chest like mist. You feel nothing. Their voice is static, a broken radio frequency: *“Do you understand what you’ve done?”* You tilt your head. Your reflection in their vacant eyes shows a creature with too many teeth, a smile that splits the horizon. 

The mercury rises. It laps at your ankles, cold and numbing. Shapes writhe beneath its surface—not faces anymore, but *memories*. A child’s abandoned kite snagged in thorns. A door left unbolted. A vial of poison tipped into a shared cup. You laugh, and the sound cracks the sky open. Rain falls, but it’s not water. It’s ash, soft and relentless, burying the ruin you’ve made. 

When you wake, your palms are clean. The guilt never comes.

The dream lingers in your nerves like a forgotten chord, vibrating in a key that doesn’t exist.
