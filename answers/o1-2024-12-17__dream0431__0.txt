I am dreaming. You drift off into a deep and starry slumber. At first, it feels almost weightless—the air around you is balmy, tinged with the scent of sun-warmed citrus and fresh bouquets of tropical flowers. Suddenly, you find yourself standing on the edge of a grand courtyard, cobblestones gleaming like polished onyx under a silver moon. All around, fireflies twinkle and dance in patterns that mirror your calm yet conflicted thoughts.

In front of you stretches a golden archway entwined with thorny vines that pulse faintly with an ember-like glow. When you step forward, the vines part. Entering through the archway, you discover a lush garden. Flowers in unearthly shades—radiant blues, shimmering violets, and glowing pinks—sway hypnotically with no visible breeze. A winding path leads toward an old, broken fountain surrounded by carefully tended rose bushes. Each rose has petals shaped like scattered shards of broken mirrors, reflecting fractured pieces of your past.

You approach the fountain, and you notice water gently spilling from the mouth of a carved lion’s head. Its once-majestic mane is chipped, and the water’s trickle sounds like distant, muffled sighs. You realize this fountain is where you keep your resentment. The lion’s weary eyes seem to lock with yours, silently asking why you continue to carry this pain. You understand, in that moment, that your grudges have grown too heavy. The memory of the old injury rises in your mind—stinging like an open wound. A part of you resents that it still aches. Another part of you wishes to release the burden.

Working toward forgiveness, you kneel at the fountain’s base, gently skimming your fingers across its cool stone. As you touch it, you sense an unspoken invitation: Let go. The water shimmers under your hands, turning from dull, grayish trickles to luminous streams of liquid silver. Recognizing that you must face the injury directly, you see a reflection in the water’s surface—a version of you from the past, standing behind you with eyes full of sorrow and anger. It’s the self that was hurt, the self that couldn’t move on.

You lean toward this reflection, and tears form in your dreamlike eyes, dripping into the fountain and merging with the flow of silver. In that moment, the reflection shifts. The figure behind you takes an uncertain step closer, placing a hand upon your shoulder, mirroring the support and compassion you wish you had offered yourself all along. It’s as if you are finally giving comfort to the piece of you that was lost. Warmth spreads slowly through your chest, blossoming like a sunrise, casting away shadows of bitterness and pain.

Then the roses around you begin to transform—their mirror-like petals converging into smooth, translucent crystals that shine with forgiveness and release. The luminous vines that once guarded the doorway twist themselves into a gentle canopy over your head, letting the night sky peek through. Countless stars swirl above in an indigo expanse, each a tiny beacon of hope. You can feel your heart lighten as the last echoes of resentment melt into the garden’s peace.

You sense a calm strength settling within you, like an inner guardian that promises to remember the lessons of the past without holding onto its burdens. You stand, breathing in the fragrant air, and you realize that though the memory of the injury remains, you are no longer chained to its bitterness. It is a part of your story, and yet you can accept it as it is and continue to move forward.

With that realization, the dream begins to tremble in brilliance. You glimpse the archway once more. It seems so much less foreboding now, opening to a soft horizon where sunlight edges the sky in rose and gold. Gentle warmth caresses your skin, and as you step through, the feeling of resentment that once clung to you falls away, left behind in the garden of acceptance. You move onward wiser, lighter, and with a renewed sense of compassion for yourself and your relationships.

The dream dissolves, and you awaken with your heart beating steadily, a tender resolve glowing within. You have faced the injury and your resentment head-on, and in your dream—brimming with vivid imagery and hidden revelations—you have chosen forgiveness.
