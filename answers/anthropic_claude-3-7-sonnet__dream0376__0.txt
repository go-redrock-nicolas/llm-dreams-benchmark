I am dreaming. I find myself walking through a forest where the trees grow in impossible spirals, their bark smooth like polished jade. The sky above shifts between deep indigo and amber, never settling on a single hue. As I walk, my footsteps leave behind small pools of light that evaporate into fireflies moments later.

The path forks unexpectedly, and I notice a doorway standing freely between two ancient willows, its frame made of intertwined branches that seem to breathe. Without touching it, the door swings open to reveal not a continuation of the forest, but an endless library stretching in all directions—up, down, and sideways, defying gravity.

Books float by like curious fish, their pages fluttering. When I reach for one, it gently lands in my palms and opens to reveal words that transform into miniature scenes, playing out stories I somehow recognize but have never experienced. The characters notice me watching and wave, inviting me into their narrative.

As I step toward them, the floor beneath me becomes a mosaic of memories—some mine, some belonging to people I've never met. Each tile pulses with emotions I can feel resonating through my body.

In the distance, a bell tolls with a sound like laughter, and suddenly I'm ascending through layers of clouds painted with landscapes from impossible worlds—mountains made of clockwork, oceans of lantern light, cities built from music made visible.

The higher I rise, the more I understand something profound yet just beyond articulation, something about connection and separation, about time folding in on itself like origami, about how every dream is a universe trying to communicate with another.
