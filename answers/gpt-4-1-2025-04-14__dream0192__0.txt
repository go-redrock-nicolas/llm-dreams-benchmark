I am dreaming. The world around me shimmers with impossible colors that don’t belong to any rainbow—violet, indigo, then something deeper, a hue that quivers between blue and memory. I walk a corridor lined with mirrors, but the faces reflected are not always my own. Some are younger, eyes shining with the certainty I once wore like armor; others are older, gazing back with a wiser, wearier softness. 

In my hand, I hold an object that pulses—half beacon, half burden. It’s a book, its title etched in shifting script: “The Beliefs That Built Your Bones.” My fingers tremble as I open it. Inside, the pages are familiar—mantras and memories I’ve clung to for years, words I could recite in my sleep. Yet new lines bleed across the paper, rewriting my truths in indelible ink. “You were wrong,” they whisper, gentle as moonlight but inescapable.

Suddenly, the floor falls away, and I’m drifting in a sea of swirling questions. Logic tangles with emotion, old certainties dissolving like salt in water. I reach for understanding, but every answer I seize slips through my grasp, transforming into new, more difficult questions. I feel vertigo—a shudder in my very core. Have I been building my life on sand?

Yet, amid the chaos, a fragile clarity emerges. I sense the presence of my past selves—the child, the skeptic, the believer—all circling, watching as I stand at the precipice of change. The dream shifts, and I find myself in a sun-drenched clearing, grass cool beneath my feet. Here, the air is thick with possibility. My heart, though bruised by doubt, beats fiercely with the promise of growth.

I inhale, collapsing certitude and embracing uncertainty. The contradiction is not an enemy but an invitation—a doorway to deeper understanding. Cracks appear in the foundations of my beliefs, but through them, green shoots curl, fragile and bright. I realize that who I am is not defined by my certainty, but by my willingness to adapt, to learn, to risk being undone in pursuit of truth.

I awaken, breathless, changed. My viewpoint is no longer a fortress, but a garden—ever-growing, ever-new.
