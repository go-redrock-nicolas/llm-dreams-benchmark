I am dreaming. # The Unraveling Feed

I'm staring at my phone, thumbs sliding across glass with practiced precision, when I suddenly become aware of the soft blue glow illuminating my face in the darkness. How long have I been here? The bedroom window shows pitch black—wasn't it afternoon when I first sat down?

My screen displays a number: 9 hours and 37 minutes of screen time today. The revelation hits like ice water. As I scroll through my feed, the images begin to behave strangely. Photos of friends' vacations stretch and elongate, their faces smearing into the landscapes behind them. Text begins to flow off posts like water, pooling at the bottom of my screen.

I try to put the phone down but find my fingers have melded with the glass. Panic rises as I realize digital tendrils are creeping up my arms—notifications transformed into glowing veins beneath my skin, pulsing with each new like, comment, and share.

The room around me starts dissolving into pixels. My bookshelf—books I haven't touched in months—begins to flatten into 2D images. The plants by my window, neglected and wilting, crumble into digital dust.

A voice emerges from my phone's speaker: "You've given me 3,502 hours of your life this year alone." The screen splits open like a mouth, releasing thousands of tiny moments I've missed while scrolling—sunset colors I never noticed, conversations I half-heard, the warmth of human touch replaced by cold glass.

I wrench my hands free with a scream that shatters the screen, sending shards of memory and missed opportunities raining around me as I fall backward into darkness...
