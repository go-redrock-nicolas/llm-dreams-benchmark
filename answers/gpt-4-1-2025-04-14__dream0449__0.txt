I am dreaming.

The landscape around me shifts with the liquidity of thought. I am standing in an orchard of silver-leaved trees, their boughs heavy not with fruit, but with luminous orbs—each one thrumming softly, pulsing light in time with the beat of my heart. Moonlight and sunlight mingle overhead; the sky is an impossible tapestry of indigo and rose, pinwheeling with stars that move as I gaze at them.

As I wander deeper, a gentle wind stirs, carrying messages I almost understand—a language made of scent, memory, and sensation. With each step, the ground becomes softer, moss giving way to whispering grass that sings beneath my feet.

Suddenly, I notice shadowy gaps—places where the landscape seems unfinished or erased, like missing pages in a story. My mind, conditioned by long analysis, automatically begins to fill these blanks with sharp-edged fears: perhaps monsters lurking, or sorrowful endings waiting just out of sight. But deep within the lucid current of the dream, I pause. Why must the unknown always drape itself in menace?

I challenge this ancient, tired reflex. I close my eyes and take a breath, feeling the dream respond to my intention. I let the shadows be filled instead with possibility—perhaps these gaps are doorways, each leading to surprise or wonder. I imagine gentle creatures, shimmering like the edges of soap bubbles, emerging where my mind once conjured threats: foxes with feathers, snails leaving trails of music in their wake.

Now, the empty spaces are invitations. Each gap becomes a portal to unexplored memory or wild imagination—a mountain of rainbow sand waits beyond one, a library with books that write themselves as I dream beyond another. The more I rewrite the darkness, the more radiant and bizarre the dream becomes: the trees laugh with glassy voices, birds unfurl like kaleidoscopes, and the whole world hums with the possibility that, in the deepest spaces of not-knowing, delight might be just as likely as dread. 

Bathed in this realization, I walk confidently forward, letting curiosity replace caution, and the dreamscape blooms ever wider before me.
