I am dreaming. I am standing on a stage draped in velvet the color of crushed violets, spotlights casting pools of liquid gold at my feet. The air hums with the scent of stage wax and something sweet, like burnt sugar. My fingers, which I’ve always thought too stubby, too clumsy, trace the edge of a cello’s scroll—an instrument I abandoned years ago, convinced my hands would never coax anything beautiful from its strings.

Yet now, the crowd before me is not jeering or bored. They are weeping. Openly. A woman in the front row clutches her pearls, her mascara bleeding into the delicate lines of her face. A man with a silver-streaked beard presses his palms together as if in prayer, mouthing, "Brava." The applause doesn’t sound like hands clapping but like a thunderstorm rolling in from the sea, relentless and awe-struck.

My cello—*how is it here?*—rests against my knee, its wood vibrating with the ghost of a melody I don’t remember playing. The varnish gleams under the lights, revealing a flicker of my reflection: my usual face, yet somehow softer at the edges, as if viewed through a forgiving lens.

A figure materializes from the wings. A mentor I once idolized, whose quiet dismissal years ago sent me packing my music away forever. She approaches, her famous imperiousness dissolved. When she takes my hands (my *ugly* hands, hands that could never stretch an octave, hands that fumbled scales), she turns them palm-up and presses her lips to my knuckles. "You," she murmurs, "play like someone who has swallowed starlight."

And this is the horror of it: I believe her. The certainty in her voice unravels decades of self-loathing stitch by stitch. My throat tightens. The stage lights blur into halos. *Is this how healing feels?* I wonder, even as the dream fractures—because waking minds can’t hold contradictions this vast. The cello cracks like ice underfoot. The applause curdles into wind. 

I wake with my hands clutching empty air, still humming with phantom music, aching for a truth I may never understand.
