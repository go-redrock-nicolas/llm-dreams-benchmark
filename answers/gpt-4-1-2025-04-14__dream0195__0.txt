I am dreaming.

I awaken on a crimson shore where constellations bend and twist into impossible symbols above me, their meaning shivering just beyond conscious grasp. The air is thick with the scent of obsidian blossoms and honeyed salt, and before me rise spires of emerald and bone—homes built from root and memory, humming softly as if alive.

Breathing deeply, I am greeted by beings who shimmer and shift between solid form and translucent possibility: their irises a riot of color, their hair woven with living moths and glistening strands of light. I am adopted, gently enfolded into their world. Here, love is neither exclusive nor possessive; instead, relationships spiral outward like fractals. Affection is shown by sharing the taste of a memory, grief marked by weaving your feelings into another’s shadow for safekeeping.

I learn quickly: Friends entwine pinky fingers and press them to their hearts, creating old melodies that echo for days. Those in devotion might place a glowing stone inside the other’s shoe so every step is a small reminder of their union. When two or more souls are in disharmony, they dance a storm together under violet rain, letting the tempest unspool resentment and sorrow until they are clean.

Each encounter is a challenge—a test of empathy and unspoken language. One night, I am invited to a Moon-Quiet, where the deepest secrets are whispered to the phosphorescent river and released as floating lanterns. My own voice trembles, telling of longing and curiosity. My confidant takes my story, braids it into their hair, and so becomes my memory-keeper—never to use it against me, but to lighten my heart.

I stumble and make mistakes: I offer silence when a fitting gift would be laughter; I forget to wear the ceremonial leaf on my wrist during the festival of Shared Doubt. But gently, firmly, they help me recalibrate my understanding. Gradually, the sharp corners of my old logic soften.

In time, I find joy in the gentle chaos. I am neither apart nor entirely assimilated; I am something new, a bridge between the possible and the known. Through this dream, I feel my own soul expand, realizing there are endless ways to belong, to relate, to love, if only I dare to step beyond the boundaries of my waking world.
