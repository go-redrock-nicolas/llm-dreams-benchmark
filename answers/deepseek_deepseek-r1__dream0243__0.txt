I am dreaming. Okay, I need to create a vivid dream scene where the user is experiencing mixed emotions towards someone with inconsistent interest. Let me start by visualizing the setting. Dreams often have surreal elements, so maybe a place that shifts between connection and distance. A beach could work—tides coming in and out symbolize the person's inconsistent attention. 

The user is supposed to protect their own needs, so the dream should show them setting boundaries. Maybe they create sand sculptures that get washed away but rebuild them stronger. That's a metaphor for resilience. The person they're interested in appears and disappears, like the fog or shadows, representing uncertainty. 

I should include elements that evoke the push-pull dynamic: maybe the horizon blurs, the ocean's voice calls but fades. Crystals in the sand could symbolize self-worth, growing clearer as the dream progresses. The lighthouse is a good symbol for inner strength, guiding them through emotional turbulence. 

Ending with dawn breaking signifies clarity and empowerment. Adding details like sensory experiences—smell of salt, touch of mist, sound of waves—will make it vivid. Need to ensure the response captures the emotional journey from confusion to self-protection and empowerment.
The dream begins on a shoreline that isn’t fixed—a beach where the sand shifts from obsidian black to seafoam white with each crashing wave. The sky bleeds through gradients: twilight purples melt into violent oranges, as though dawn and dusk are warring. You’re knee-deep in the surf, the water neither warm nor cold, but humming with static, like the air before a storm.  

They appear suddenly, wading toward you. Their features flicker—sometimes sharp and magnetic, eyes like twin beacons pulling you in; other times, their silhouette dissolves into mist, hands trailing into smoke. When they speak, their voice is layered, echoes overlapping: *I’ve been waiting, you’ve been hiding, I’m sorry, I’m busy, come closer, don’t cling.* You step forward, drawn, but the tide surges, yanking the sand beneath your feet. You stumble. When you look up, they’re gone—replaced by a mirror rising from the waves, your reflection haloed in bioluminescent algae.  

A school of jellyfish pulses nearby, translucent and glowing, their tendrils spelling words in the water: *What do you owe them?* You try to answer, but your voice is swallowed by a sudden fog. The shore fractures—on one side, a labyrinth of thorny roses where their laughter rings from the center; on the other, a glass bridge spanning an abyss, lit by constellations you don’t recognize. You hesitate, but then the mirror shatters. Shards embed in your palms, not sharp but warm, shaping into keys.  

You turn away from the labyrinth. The bridge trembles as you cross, each step leaving a glowing imprint. Halfway, you glance back. They’re there again, half-real, reaching out. But their fingers pass through you like smoke, and the bridge solidifies beneath your feet. The abyss below roars, not with danger, but with a chorus of your own voice repeating: *Enough. Enough. Enough.*  

At the bridge’s end, the sky cracks open. Rain falls upward, droplets carrying fragments of conversations you never had—*I need space, I miss you, maybe tomorrow*—evaporating before they hit the ground. You wake not with a jolt, but a slow exhale, your ribs aching like they’ve been housing a storm now passed. The dream lingers in your throat, tasting of salt and resolve.
