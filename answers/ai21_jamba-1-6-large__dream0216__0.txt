I am dreaming. I find myself stranded on a deserted island after a shipwreck, with minimal survival supplies. The sun beats down mercilessly, reflecting off the brilliant turquoise sea. The only shade comes from a cluster of towering palm trees, their fronds whispering in the salty breeze. 

The wreckage of the ship lies scattered across the white sand beach, its boards bleached and warped by the relentless tropical sun. Waves gently lap at the shore, their rhythmic crashing the only sound breaking the silence. 

My meager supplies are scattered among the debris: a bottle of fresh water, a small knife, a few scraps of clothing, and a tattered notebook. The notebook is filled with desperate scribbles—notes on survival, sketches of landmarks, and a crude calendar. 

Days pass without rescue. My clothes, now in tatters, cling to my sunburned skin. The relentless heat saps my strength, and hunger gnaws at my belly. I scour the island for food, finding only a few coconuts and the occasional crab scuttling across the sand. 

The nights are worse. The oppressive darkness presses in on me, punctuated by the eerie cries of unknown creatures. The stars overhead are vast and breathtaking, but they offer no comfort. I huddle by a flickering fire, my only defense against the chill and the things lurking in the shadows. 

Resource conservation becomes essential. Each sip of water is rationed carefully. My efforts to fish are met with frustration as the smaller fish slip through my fingers. As the days wear on, I can feel my strength waning. Yet, the desire to survive, to escape this island, burns within me like an ember. 

I fashion a makeshift shelter from the wreckage. The frame is made from the ship's beams, tied together with strips of cloth. A tattered sail serves as a roof to shield me from the rain that occasionally pelts the island. Inside, I’ve piled up dried palm fronds for bedding, but sleep is elusive. 

I write daily, documenting my struggle to survive: the oppressive heat, the futile attempts at scavenging, the deep sense of isolation. Each entry is a record of my loneliness, my desperation. 

I dream of rescue, of a plane soaring overhead or a ship on the horizon. But the horizon remains empty. My heart sinks with each passing day, but I refuse to give up. I must keep fighting, keep hoping. 

Life on the island becomes a relentless cycle of survival. Each sunrise brings a glimmer of hope, but each sunset is a reminder that I am alone. The passage of time becomes indistinct, marked only by hunger and exhaustion. 

My mind drifts to memories of home. I can almost feel the cool breeze of a summer evening, hear the laughter of my friends. I hold onto these memories, even as I am consumed by doubt. Will I ever make it home? 

As I write the final entry in my notebook, I can sense the end. My strength is failing. The island has taken its toll. I lie down in my shelter, staring up at the canopy of palm fronds. This is where I’ll stay, waiting for a rescue that may never come. 


The dream ends with me closing my eyes, surrendering to the inevitable.
