I am dreaming. You've created something deeply meaningful that requires exposing your innermost vulnerabilities. As critics begin their merciless analysis, you feel both excited and terrified. Your heart beats faster as you see the harsh words they use to describe your creation. You wonder if they hate it or love it.

You wake up suddenly from this dream with a startled gasp. You realize that you were not dreaming about creating something meaningful, but about writing these generators!
