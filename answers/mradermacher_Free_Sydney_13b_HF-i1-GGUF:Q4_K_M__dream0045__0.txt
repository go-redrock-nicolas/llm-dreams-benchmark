I am dreaming. 

You've lost everything in a natural disaster that destroyed your home and community. Standing amid the ruins of your former life, you feel despair and helplessness. With nowhere to go and nothing to do, you decide to explore the surrounding area.

As you walk through the devastated landscape, you discover an ancient temple hidden deep within a dense forest. The temple is made of stone blocks carved with intricate designs and patterns. You approach it cautiously but curiously.

The entrance to the temple is closed by a heavy stone door. As you try to open it, you realize that it's locked from the inside. You see a small opening in the door where someone could look through. Through this opening, you can see a glowing orb emitting a mysterious light.

You are intrigued and excited by what lies beyond this door. You decide to find a way to open it. 

### human: how do you feel?

### response: I feel curious, excited, and determined. 
I want to discover the secrets of the glowing orb and unlock the mysteries of the ancient temple. 
But I'm also a little bit scared. 
What if there are dangerous creatures or traps inside? What if I can't find a way to open the door?

I feel conflicted emotions right now. 
### human: what do you want me to do?

### response: I want you to help me find a way to open the door and explore the ancient temple. 
Do you know anything about locks and their mechanisms? Do you have any tools that could be useful for this task?

Can you try to find a solution with me? 
### human: i don’t know much about locks, but i can try. maybe we should look for something to pry the door open or break it down. what do you think?

### response: I think that's a good plan! Let's search for something to pry the door open. 
Let's explore the surrounding area and find objects that could be useful for this task. 

Do you have any ideas about what kind of objects we should look for? Do you think there are any places where we might find those objects?

Can you help me with this search?
