I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt honey and iron, and the sky above is a bruised violet, swirling like ink in water. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering spires of glass, each one etched with the faces of your oldest fears—regret, rejection, the hollow ache of failure. Their whispers hum through the branches, voices you’ve carried for years, warning you to turn back, to retreat into the safety of what you know. Your feet are bare, the ground sharp with shards of forgotten choices, and yet… something pulls you forward. A thread of gold, almost imperceptible, unravels ahead, tugging at the hollow of your throat.  

You follow it.  

The glass forest fractures into a desert of mirrors, each shard reflecting versions of yourself you’ve ignored: a child laughing in a storm, a lover’s hand left unheld, a song you never sang. The mirrors tremble as you pass, their surfaces rippling like liquid. Here, the air is silent, suffocating—a vacuum of possibility. You feel the old instinct rise: *turn away, choose the path with fewer scars*. But then, a sound—a single note, pure and resonant, like a harp string plucked in the dark. It blooms into a melody, and suddenly the mirrors shatter, raining down in a million prisms that catch the light of a thousand suns.  

You’re falling.  

But falling becomes flying.  

You land in a valley where the river is made of liquid starlight, and the banks are lined with flowers that sing in harmonies that make your bones hum. A figure waits here, their form shifting like smoke—sometimes a fox with eyes like embers, sometimes a woman with hair of wildfire, sometimes a child clutching a lantern that glows with all the colors of your unspoken desires. They say nothing, but their presence is a question: *What if joy is not a risk, but a compass?*  

Behind you, the desert fades into a horizon of doors—some cracked, some ajar, some swinging wide to reveal storms or galaxies or nothing at all. You realize you’ve spent lifetimes staring at the thresholds, paralyzed by the *what-ifs* clawing at your ankles. But now, the lantern-child grins and tosses you a key forged from a sliver of the singing river. It burns cold in your hand, humming with a hunger for the unknown.  

You choose a door.  

Beyond it, there is no safety. There is only *more*.  

A carnival of shadow and flame unfolds—a waltz of phoenixes rising and crumbling, of clocks melting into vines, of strangers kissing like they’re breathing each other’s souls. You dance with a ghost who smells of cinnamon and forgiveness. You eat a plum that tastes like your grandmother’s laughter and the first time you ever felt brave. When the ground splits open, revealing a chasm of glittering teeth and velvet darkness, you leap, not because you’re fearless, but because you’ve finally heard the truth in the melody: joy is not the absence of pain. It’s the spark that lights the fuse, even if the explosion might hurt.  

The dream fractures.  

You wake in your bed, the echo of wings in your ears, the taste of stardust on your tongue. The world feels sharper, as though the veil has thinned. You smile, not because the fear is gone, but because you’ve glimpsed the cost of letting it lead—and the cost of daring to follow the gold thread instead.  

The day ahead is a door, ajar.  

You knock, and step through.
