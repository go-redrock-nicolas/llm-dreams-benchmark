I am dreaming.

I drift through a midnight city wrapped in mist, the streetlamps glimmering halos over cobblestones slick with memory. Faces ripple and blur around me—gentle laughter, shifting eyes, hands brushing mine in passing but never lingering. It is as though I move beneath a pane of glass, able to see and hear the warmth of those nearby but never able to touch it, forever submerged while the world floats above me.

I wander through an endless marketplace where every booth overflows with laughter and secrets. The vibrant colors bleed into one another—fuschia, indigo, sun-yellow—yet they all fade before they reach me. The vendors call out, their words a distant muffled song, and I try to respond, but my voice vanishes before it forms.

My heart aches for connection; my hands reach out, trembling, for anything solid. I spot a little girl weaving through the crowd, her red balloon a beacon in the gloom. For a moment, she sees me, meeting my eyes with understanding, and extends her tiny hand.

Hope blooms in my chest; I follow her, chasing the ribbon trailing from her balloon, but the crowd thickens, people turning their backs, faces flickering like broken screens. The marketplace fragments, and suddenly I am in a vast library with endless shelves spiraling upward, every book a story untold between friends I never made, lovers I never met, family I never held close enough.

I run my fingers over the spines, longing for one to glow back at me, to whisper an invitation. One book opens on its own, pages fluttering as if stroked by invisible wind. From between the leaves, a hundred silver threads spill out and twine gently around my wrist, tugging me softly forward.

I follow this thread out onto a rooftop, high above the hush of the city. The sky is a velvet tapestry, impossible with stars. Here, at last, I find a single figure waiting—a stranger with eyes like mine, reflecting loneliness and yearning in equal measure.

We sit side by side, wordless. No longer adrift, I let my loneliness rest next to theirs. In that moment, under the watchful sky, connection is not about noise or nearness but shared silence, two souls briefly touching across the fathomless dream.
