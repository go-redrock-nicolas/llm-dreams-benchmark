I am dreaming. **You are dreaming.**  

The air shimmers with an uncanny luminescence, thick with the scent of ozone and something deeper—a fragrance like old parchment and distant, forgotten storms. You stand in a vast amphitheater carved not from stone, but from the twisting roots of an ancient, eldritch tree, its branches stretching into a sky of swirling violet and gold. The ground beneath your feet pulses faintly, alive.  

Before you, two entities stand in opposition. To your left, a being woven from shifting shadows and constellations, its voice a chorus of whispers speaking in unison—pleading, reasoning, mourning. It speaks of *mercy*, of cycles unbroken, of the sanctity of all life, no matter how flawed. It carries with it the weight of a thousand dying stars, each one a world that chose compassion over survival.  

To your right, a figure sculpted from molten silver and relentless logic, its words precise, cutting. It argues for *justice*, for consequence, for the preservation of the greater whole at any cost. Behind it, mirrors stretch into infinity, each one reflecting a different timeline—some utopian, some desolate—all hinging on this moment, this decision.  

The testimonies ripple through you like thunder, resonating in your bones. You feel the ache of both truths, the agony of the either-or. A third presence lingers at the edges of your awareness—the silent observer, the universe itself waiting.  

**What do you choose?**  

(And then—just as you open your mouth to speak—you feel the first tug of waking, the dream fraying at the edges… but the weight of it stays with you, lingering like a half-remembered prophecy.)
