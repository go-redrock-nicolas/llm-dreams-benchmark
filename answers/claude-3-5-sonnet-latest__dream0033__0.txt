I am dreaming. In this ancient temple, the air hangs heavy with the scent of aged stone and sacred incense that has permeated the walls for centuries. Flickering torch light dances across weathered hieroglyphs when suddenly, the ground beneath my feet groans like an awakening beast. Before I can react, the ornate stone floor splinters and gives way, sending me plummeting into darkness.

I land hard on cold, damp earth in a chamber so vast I can't see its boundaries. The air is thick and stale, carrying the musty breath of millennia. Above me, fragments of the collapsed floor have sealed my exit, leaving only a few thin shafts of light that pierce the darkness like divine spears.

My chest tightens as I realize the oxygen is limited in this sealed tomb. Ancient statues of forgotten deities loom in the shadows, their unseeing eyes seeming to track my movements. Their faces appear to shift and change in my peripheral vision, but when I look directly at them, they're motionless once more.

As I scan the chamber desperately for escape, my torch light reveals something extraordinary - a massive wall covered in luminescent crystals that pulse with an inner light, like a heartbeat. They seem to respond to my presence, glowing brighter as I approach. The air grows thinner with each breath, but beneath the crystals, I notice small symbols beginning to move and rearrange themselves, forming patterns that seem hauntingly familiar...

My head starts to swim from the depleting oxygen, but I'm transfixed by the dancing symbols. They're trying to tell me something, perhaps showing me the way out, if only I can decipher their message before it's too late...
