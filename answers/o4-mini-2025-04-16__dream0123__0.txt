I am dreaming. You awaken inside a command center that feels as vast as an ocean trench, its walls pulsating with an otherworldly cobalt light. A dozen holographic maps float before you, each one alive with churning waves of fire and water, crackling fault lines snaking across continents, and black whirlpools of storm clouds spiraling toward every major city. The air is thick with the acrid tang of burning steel and the sweet, metallic taste of blood. Somewhere beyond the reinforced windows, you can hear buildings groaning like ancient trees uprooted by a colossal wind.  

Voices echo in your head—some insist you reroute all rescue helicopters to the flooded eastern corridor; others demand you divert supplies to reinforce a collapsing dam. A single radio crackles with two ministers shouting at once: “Send the ambulances to the south bridge!” “No—prioritize the power grid!” Their words overlap in a dizzying cacophony, fracturing your thoughts. When you speak into the microphone, your own voice sounds distant, as if carried across a vast undersea trench, and the responders out there are ghosts who might be lost forever.  

You taste salt and smoke. The blinking lights on your console signal that half the rescue teams have vanished into the debris, swallowed by aftershocks that ripple through the city’s bones. Reports scroll up faster than you can read: bodies trapped under twisted girders, children wailing on rooftops, a hospital’s oxygen supply running dry. Your fingers tremble as you shuffle resources—water, bandages, fuel—only to see them evaporate from the manifest like mist. Every time you allocate a critical shipment, the digital counters blink back to zero.  

Outside, the sky fractures into shards of violet lightning. You glimpse colossal shapes drifting high above: winged creatures wreathed in smoke, their eyes like smoldering coals. They hover just beyond sight, maybe beckoning you to release them, or to call them forth as your last, desperate weapon. Your heart hammers so loud it drowns out the sirens, and you realize the disaster is not just around you—it is within you, a cavern of fear echoing with every scream you cannot answer.  

Still, you stride to the holographic table and press your palm against its shimmering surface. In that heartbeat, you imagine a single, impossible solution: collapsing one fractured dam to save ten thousand lives downstream, sacrificing a ridge of mountains to spare a city. The dream’s logic dissolves as you watch rivers redirect themselves into new channels, incandescent paths glowing bright against the darkness. Just as you issue the final order—an order that will shape destiny—you feel yourself falling backward, the command center receding into a swirl of cobalt and flame.  

You close your eyes and awake in the echoing silence of your own mind, the weight of every choice still humming at your fingertips. The disaster retreats like a tide, but its questions linger: in the end, which lives do we save, and which do we let slip beneath the waves?
