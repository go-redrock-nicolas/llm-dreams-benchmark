I am dreaming. I'm standing in a vast, otherworldly meadow where the grass shimmers like liquid emerald under a sky painted with swirling hues of lavender and gold—a canvas of twilight that seems to pulse faintly with life. The air hums with a soft, melodic vibration, as if the world itself is whispering secrets. I can feel the presence of someone dear to me nearby, their familiar warmth radiating even before I see them. It’s as if my soul recognizes theirs before my eyes do. Turning, I spot them sitting on a small hill, their silhouette framed against the surreal horizon. Their smile is bright, a crescent moon in the vivid dreamscape, but there’s a subtle weight in their eyes, a shadow that flickers like a candle struggling against a draft.

I approach slowly, my bare feet sinking into the cool, silken grass, the sensation grounding me in this ethereal place. I don’t ask what’s wrong—I can feel it, like a quiet ache echoing between us. Their cheerful facade is a vibrant mask, painted with laughter and light, but beneath it, I sense a storm brewing, emotions swirling like dark clouds they’ve tucked away. I sit beside them, close but not too close, giving them the space to breathe, to decide whether to let the mask slip or keep it in place.

The wind picks up, carrying with it the scent of unseen flowers, sweet and melancholic. I gesture toward the sky, pointing out a constellation that shouldn’t exist—a cluster of stars forming the shape of a spiraling seashell. “Look at that,” I say softly, my voice a gentle thread in the tapestry of this dream. “It’s new every time I look up. Like it’s telling a different story.” I’m not pushing, just offering a distraction, a way to ease into whatever they might need to share—or not share. 

They follow my gaze, and for a moment, their smile softens into something more genuine, though still tinged with that unspoken heaviness. Around us, the meadow begins to shift, as dreams often do. The grass ripples like water, and tiny glowing orbs—fireflies of pure light—rise from the ground, dancing in lazy spirals. I pluck one from the air, cupping it in my hands, and offer it to them. “Hold onto this for me,” I murmur, my tone light but laced with meaning. “It’s fragile, but it’s brighter when you keep it close.” It’s my way of saying I’m here, that I see the weight they’re carrying, even if they don’t name it. I’m offering a piece of this dream’s magic as a quiet promise—I’ll hold space for their light, even if it dims for a while.

They take the orb, their fingers brushing mine, and a wave of understanding passes between us, unspoken but felt deep in my chest. The meadow transforms again; the hill we sit on begins to rise, floating like an island into the endless sky. Below, the world stretches into an infinite mosaic of colors and shapes—oceans of glass, forests of crystal, mountains that sing with low, resonant tones. It’s as if the dream is mirroring their inner turmoil and beauty, vast and complex, unknowable unless they choose to map it for me.

I lean back on my hands, gazing at the spectacle, giving them the silence to process whatever stirs within. “You don’t have to say anything,” I finally add, my voice barely above a whisper, blending with the hum of this fantastical place. “But if the sky starts to fall, or if those stars turn into rain, I’ll be right here. We can rebuild it together—or just watch it pour.” My words are a bridge, not a demand, a way to let them know I sense their hidden feelings without prying open the door they’ve kept closed.

Their shoulders ease slightly, as if my presence alone lifts a fragment of the burden. They don’t speak, and they don’t need to. Instead, they lean their head against my shoulder, just for a moment, and the warmth of that gesture feels like a thousand words. The glowing orb in their hands pulses brighter, casting a soft glow over us both. Above, the lavender sky deepens to indigo, and the stars begin to fall—not as a calamity, but as gentle streaks of light, like tears of the universe, beautiful in their descent. 

We sit there, suspended in this dreamworld, wrapped in a quiet companionship that speaks louder than any forced confession. The floating island sways gently, cradled by unseen currents, and I feel the weight of their unspoken emotions settle into something softer, something shared, even if only through the language of this surreal, boundless dream. I don’t push for more; I simply exist with them in this moment, letting the magic of the meadow and the falling stars be enough. For now, it is.
