I am dreaming. In this realm where time spirals like ribbons of smoke and gravity bends with the whims of thought, I walk upon a bridge suspended above a sky. Yes—a bridge forged of silver threads and humming with the pulse of forgotten stars, floating in the heavens themselves. The sky below me churns with clouds that are not clouds but thoughts turned to vapor, emotions given texture. Watching me from above are constellations with eyes—watchful, ancient, blinking in the rhythm of breath I cannot hear yet feel in my marrow.

The air is thick with sensation: I can hear the laughter of sunlight as it dapples across the surface of the clouds. Each golden spark tickles the skin like the whisper of a secret never spoken aloud. Beneath my bare feet—the bridge thrums like a live wire made of dreams. It's singing, yes, singing in a language older than sound, older than silence. I understand instinctively each note's meaning, though I struggle to translate them into my waking lexicon.

Every step sends ripples through the sky beneath me. The clouds shiver, fold, and reform like artists re-creating their masterpieces in an eternal loop. Shapes emerge: a whale diving through cloud-air, a city frozen mid-scream, towers spiraling upward into infinity, their windows flickering with stories never told.

There is a stillness that sings, not of emptiness, but of the fullness of what is yet unexpressed. My heightened senses drink in every nuance—the scent of memory clinging to the wind, the taste of color in the light, the tremble of unseen footsteps echoing from time’s edge.

Then, a presence begins to materialize ahead of me. It drifts as a cloak made of mist and fire, its form constantly unraveling before it reassembles. It is neither male nor female, neither creature nor human, but all and none of these. Spirit, maybe. Or dream, given will.

It gestures—not with hands, but with a flicker of intent—and the sky beneath me parts like a curtain lifted by a sacred hand. Below lies a city not of buildings but of frozen emotions, solidified desires, each statue a monument to ecstasy, grief, hope, and fury. Glistening threads of golden breath drift up from the surface like smoke from temple burners.

I understand, without knowing why, that this is the *City of Dormant Passions*, and each step taken upon its surface will awaken something long forgotten. At the center, a heart glows—an emerald sun encased in crystal, pulsing with ancient, aching want.

The being murmurs in the voice of wind through canyon walls:  
*“You have come not to escape knowing, but to remember feeling. You were cut off from this depth for too long—now the dream, it beckons you to recover what you buried. To witness what hides in breath and shadow. To own what lies undreamed in your veins.”*

And I know, in that moment, that this is no ordinary dream. This is a pilgrimage of sensation, a voyage through the oceans of the unsaid world within me—where everything unseen is more real. More urgent. More alive. 

I step forward.  

The journey begins again.
