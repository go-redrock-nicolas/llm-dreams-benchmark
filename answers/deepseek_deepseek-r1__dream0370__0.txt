I am dreaming. The transition from my ordinary reality into this vivid dreamscape feels both jarring and natural, like stepping into a river that changes temperature with each ripple.  The air around me hums with a soft, golden light, though I can't see its source; it clings to everything like pollen.  Before me, a person sits cross-legged on a floor made of shifting mosaic tiles—amber, indigo, rust—their edges alive, rearranging themselves in slow, liquid patterns.  I don't recognize them, but their presence feels familiar, as if pulled from a forgotten corner of my memory.

They hold a small clay bowl cradled in their palms, filled with something that glimmers faintly—broken glass, perhaps, or crushed stars.  Their shoulders tremble, though no sound escapes.  The air thickens with the incense of sorrow, a scent like wet earth and burnt cedar.  Suddenly, the tiles beneath them fracture, spilling crimson threads upward—not blood, but light, braiding into shapes that hover between flames and feathers.  I reach out, but my hand passes through theirs.  They don't look up, but their voice blooms directly inside my skull: "Even broken things hold the resonance of their making."

Every syllable vibrates in my marrow.  Without thinking, I kneel and mimic their posture.  The tiles grow hot against my knees, then melt into cool moss.  My own hands—when did they start shimmering?—now cradle emptiness.  Before panic sets in, the stranger's tears fall into their bowl.  Each drop splits into moths made of stained glass, iridescent wings casting prismatic fractals that stitch the air itself into a trembling tapestry.  One lands on my wrist, delicate as a breath.  I feel the echo of their grief—a lover's name eroded by time, a bridge crumbling mid-step, the weight of unspoken apologies fossilized in the throat.  When I inhale, the fragments become mine, yet lighter, as if sorrow has been translated into a dialect of forgiveness.

The mosaic floor dissolves into a lake of liquid mercury. Our reflections warp and merge.  Their face flickers—now a child, now ancient, now a shifting constellation—before dissolving into smoke that tastes of myrrh and monsoon rain.  The moths surge upward, dissolving the dream's edges into a haze of gold and violet.  I wake with the taste of that smoke on my tongue and an unfamiliar warmth nestled beneath my ribs, pulsing in time with a distant, unseen heartbeat.

In the lingering haze between dream and awakening, the world folds into fractals of light and shadow. The air shimmers with residual echoes—a symphony of whispers in a language of rust and silk. I find myself standing on the shore of a glassine lake, its surface slick with the colors of twilight. The water is still, yet alive, each ripple a flicker of transient memory. Across the expanse, the stranger reappears, not as a solid form but as an ember-glow silhouette, edges fraying into threads of burnt sienna and cobalt. They lift their hands, and the lake responds, rising in liquid spirals that coil like serpents made of molten opal.  

A resonance swells—a sound deeper than thunder, softer than a moth’s wing. It hums through my bones, blurring the boundary between my body and the charged atmosphere. The water-serpents spiral into auroras overhead, dissolving into a rain of luminescent petals. Each one lands with a faint chime, sinking into the ground to sprout crystalline stalks that twist into spires, forming a labyrinth around us. The stranger’s voice threads through the towers, a vibration more than words: *"Follow the hollows where the light won’t touch."*  

The labyrinth’s walls glimmer with bioluminescent veins, but between them lie crevices of absolute darkness—voids that pull at me like breath held too long. I step into one, and the world inverts. Gravity liquefies; I float in a starless expanse. Distant pinpricks ignite—eyes of unseen creatures, or perhaps dormant memories flaring to life. The darkness itself becomes tactile, a velvet pressure against my skin, humming with a low, mournful frequency. I realize it’s not empty; it’s *waiting*.  

The stranger materializes beside me, now a silhouette of negative space, outlined by the faintest silver shimmer. They extend a hand, and in their palm glows a single seed, its shell cracked, tendrils of roots spilling out like liquid mercury. As I reach to take it, the seed disintegrates into a swarm of fireflies, each carrying a flicker of fractured imagery—a fractured vase mending itself, a letter burning at the edges but never consumed, a staircase ascending into cloud. The fireflies alight on my arms, infusing my veins with their light. I feel the weight of a thousand unkept promises, but also the buoyancy of hope they carried when first spoken.  

The void ripples. A thread of sound emerges—a lullaby in a voice I almost recognize. The fireflies spiral into a vortex, pulling me downward into a pool of liquid shadow. It coils around me, cool and heavy, but instead of suffocating, it *unravels* me. Layers peel away—fears, masks, the calluses of decades—until all that remains is a filament of raw presence, throbbing like a newborn star.  

The stranger’s form splinters into stardust, their voice now a chorus: *"This is where you begin."*  

I plummet into light.  

——  
Awakening comes not with a gasp but a sigh. My room is steeped in dawn’s blue-gray hue, but beneath my skin, the dream lingers—a luminous scar, a secret chord still vibrating. The warmth beneath my ribs has settled, not as an answer, but as a question shaped like a key.
