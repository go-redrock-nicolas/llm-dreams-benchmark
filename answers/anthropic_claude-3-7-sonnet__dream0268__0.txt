I am dreaming. I'm wandering through the corridors of a vast library that seems to breathe with its own consciousness. The shelves tower endlessly upward, disappearing into a ceiling of swirling mist and scattered stars. Each book contains someone's memories—mine among them—their spines glowing with different intensities of amber light.

People I half-recognize drift between the aisles, each confidently pulling volumes that supposedly contain our shared history. They speak in hushed, certain tones about an event I should remember—something about a lighthouse, a storm, and a decision that changed everything.

"Don't you remember?" asks a woman with familiar eyes but a face I can't quite place. "You were the one who held the key."

I frantically search the shelves marked with my name, but the books are frustratingly incomplete. Pages fall out as I open them, some dissolving into sand between my fingers, others showing scenes I'm certain never happened—me standing on a cliff edge, pointing toward something vital on the horizon while others followed my lead.

The library begins to shift, corridors rearranging themselves. Water starts seeping through the floor, rising slowly around my ankles. The others seem unconcerned, still chatting about this pivotal moment I apparently orchestrated.

"The timing was perfect," says a man who might be my childhood friend. "If you hadn't recognized the pattern in the lighthouse beams, we'd never have found the passage."

I feel a desperate need to reconstruct this truth they all share. In my hands, a book suddenly feels heavy, its pages revealing photographs that morph as I examine them—sometimes showing me at the center of the group, sometimes absent entirely.

The rising water carries fragments of torn pages around my knees now, each snippet containing contradictory accounts. The harder I try to assemble them, the more they scatter and transform.

The library walls begin to undulate like gentle waves as the dream begins to dissolve around the edges, leaving me suspended between believing their collective memory and trusting the hollow space where mine should be.
