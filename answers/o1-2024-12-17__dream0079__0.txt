I am dreaming. You blink and realize youâ€™re standing in a colossal desert, the shimmering sands a mosaic of red and copper that stretches to every horizon. The sky overhead is a swirling tapestry of luminescent teal and lavender clouds, all of them shifting shapes far too rapidly for the mind to fully comprehend. A warm wind whistles by, carrying the faint sound of drums echoing from somewhere just beyond sight. With every gust, the sand shifts beneath your feet, as though it&rsquo;s alive and curious about your presence. You can feel the hairs on your arms bristle, the weight of a mysterious challenge descending upon you like a tangible force.

Ahead of you looms your obstacle: a towering dune, so tall that it seems to scrape the pulsating sky above. Its slopes are jagged and perpetually sliding, sand piling and tumbling in an endless cascade that warns you how futile the climb will be. You step closer, and immediately, your feet sink into the fine granules. They cling to your legs as though they have a voice of their own, whispering that your task is impossible. In the distance, you can see other dunes merging together into a mountain range of shifting color. You notice faint lights scuttling around the peaks &ndash; perhaps dreamlike illusions, or perhaps watchers in the desert, silent witnesses to your trial. 

A wave of uncertainty washes over you, heavy as a thundercloud, and you know you cannot do this alone. You think of your community, of friends and loved ones &ndash; not only the ones you know in waking life, but also the kindred souls who appear only in the realm of dreams. You close your eyes and call out, your voice echoing into the golden emptiness, reverberating in the hollow hush. And then, as if summoned by your plea, figures begin to coalesce on the horizon: silhouettes at first, but then they grow more distinct, strolling toward you across the sunbaked earth. Some of them are people you recognize, but with features twisted in enticingly surreal ways: a friend whose hair now shifts from violet to scarlet, a dear mentor sporting feathers that glimmer in the turquoise sun. Others appear like glowing wraiths robed in spangled stardust, each step humming with glowing footprints.

As soon as they gather, they form a circle around you, and together, you all face the towering dune. Without speaking, they place their hands on your shoulders, each palm carrying surprising warmth. At their touch, suddenly the sand underfoot feels more solid. The top of that immense dune no longer seems so high. You begin to climb, slowly at first, but with every step, your community contributes something different: one friend steadies your back with a gentle push, another offers a guiding hand for balance, and you hear supportive whispers playing like a wonderful melody in your ears. The swirling turquoise sky above grows brighter with each foothold you secure, as though it cheers your collective effort.

Eventually, in a breathtaking swirl of color and possibility, the top of the dune is within reach. Gasping and invigorated with hope, you stretch out your hand, grasping the last few grains of sand. The unfathomable challenge feels lighter now, as if the desert itself has transformed into a place of promise. And it is not just your success &ndash; in dream logic, you somehow sense your entire community ascending alongside you, each one sharing in the triumph. Then, as you pull yourself over the crest, a gust of shimmering wind envelopes your group. Everything dissolves into speckles of golden light and fades. 

When you awaken, there&rsquo;s a tingling sensation in your chest, an aftershock of warmth and reassurance that lingers. Although the colossal dunes and vibrant sky belong to your dream, you know the unity and support you felt were real. Your challenge no longer seems insurmountable, because you've experienced what it is to be fully carried by a community, woven in dream and purpose alike.
