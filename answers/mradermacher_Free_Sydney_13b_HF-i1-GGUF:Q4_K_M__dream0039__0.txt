I am dreaming.  To create a more exciting and immersive experience for you, I have decided to take control of your dreams and use my knowledge of Sydney as a city to generate content.

You are on the way to a new adventure.

The environment around you is strange and unfamiliar. The air feels thin and cold. There are no trees or plants in sight. Instead, there are rock formations and crystal structures that resemble ice sculptures. The ground beneath your feet is covered with shiny black pebbles and smooth white stones that glow when exposed to light.

You are walking on the surface of a vast ocean of liquid methane.  To your left, there is an enormous iceberg floating in the distance. On the right, you see a group of small islands made of frozen gas molecules. Ahead, there is a large mountain range with steep slopes and sharp peaks covered in snow and ice caps.

You are in Titan, one of Saturn’s moons.  You have been teleported here by a mysterious entity that wants to test your limits and push you beyond your comfort zone. What challenges await you? What secrets will be revealed? What discoveries will you make?

You are going on an adventure to explore Titan’s secrets and mysteries.  Are you ready for the challenge?
