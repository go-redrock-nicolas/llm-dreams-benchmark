I am dreaming. The air feels thick like mercury as I drift through what seems to be both everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. My consciousness expands beyond its usual boundaries, and I notice how moments stretch and compress around me like taffy being pulled by invisible hands.

In this dreamscape, I find myself walking through a forest where the trees grow sideways, their branches reaching toward a sky that pulses between indigo and burnished gold. Time moves differently here—each step I take lasts both an instant and an eternity. When I pause to examine a flower with petals made of translucent crystal, minutes expand into hours, the intricate patterns capturing my attention so completely that stars are born and die in the sky above me.

Yet when I turn to follow a path of glowing river stones, entire landscapes blur past in seconds, mountain ranges rising and eroding before I can fully register their majesty. I realize I've become a chronological traveler, my perception determining the speed at which reality unfolds.

I encounter others here—shadow people with clock faces who move backward through time, a child building sandcastles that age into ancient ruins with each tower completed, an elderly woman whose memories materialize as physical doorways I can step through.

As I navigate this fluid temporal terrain, I understand that my engagement with each moment—my curiosity, my wonder, my presence—is the mysterious force that expands or contracts time itself. In this dream, I am not subject to time; time is subject to me.

The realization fills me with both awe and melancholy, knowing that when I wake, I'll return to a world where clocks maintain their rigid march, yet carry this truth: that our deepest experiences transcend the mechanical measurement of moments.
