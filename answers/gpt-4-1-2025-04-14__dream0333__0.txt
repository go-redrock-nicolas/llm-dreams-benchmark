I am dreaming.

In this vivid tapestry of a dream, the world around me is awash in twilight violet and molten gold. I stand on the edge of an endless library, its shelves spiraling toward a ceiling lost in mist, each book humming with potential futures and secret histories. The scent of old paper and honeysuckle lace the air.

Down a winding aisle, I see a figure—a young woman, shrouded in the shimmer of uncertainty—balancing on the edge of a decision. Her hands hover over a dusty, ancient tome, its cover inscribed with runes that flicker in and out of legibility. I know, with the inexplicable certainty of dream logic, that if she opens the book, she will inadvertently unleash a shadow, a mischievous consequence that will slither through her world changing things she cannot foresee.

But I alone, in this liminal space, hold the missing key: a silver page torn from the very book she contemplates. Without it, what she reads will mislead her. I clutch it tightly, feeling its cool, pulsing urgency.

An owl with jeweled feathers perches nearby, as if waiting to witness the outcome. A sense of responsibility presses down on me, heavy and humming. The very air quivers, anticipating my choice.

Should I step forward into the pooling light, revealing myself and the page—I might alter this thread of destiny, perhaps for the better, perhaps unraveling something delicate and necessary. Or is this her lesson to learn; is interference a hubris reserved for waking minds?

Drawn by empathy and intuition, I decide to intervene. I step from the shadows, the silver page glinting in my outstretched hand. The young woman turns—her eyes, wide galaxies of hope and fear, search my face. I offer her the truth she cannot find alone.

Together, we piece it back into the book. When she reads it now, the shadows that once stirred pause and recede. The library sighs, grateful, its shelves settling into a new and harmonious alignment.

The dream shifts, the colors swirl—and I awaken, my heart thudding, the wisdom of that silent decision lingering long after the dawn.
