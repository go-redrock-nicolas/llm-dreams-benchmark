I am dreaming. You blink against the pale, rose-tinged light of dawn and find yourself lying on damp grass, dew pearls clinging to your hair. The sky above is a wash of lavender and gold, streaked with clouds that drift like drifting sails. There are no hum of engines, no hum of electricity—only the distant cry of a strange bird whose plumage glints emerald and amber in the rising sun. You sit up and realize you’re dressed in rough-hewn wool tunic and leather sandals, garments woven by hand, fraying at the seams.

Rising to your feet, you glance around. Rolling hills stretch away in every direction, studded with thickets of wild roses and clusters of towering pines whose needles whisper in a wind that smells of untold secrets. On the horizon, a cluster of timber-framed huts with thatched roofs crouches beside a river so clear you can see fish silvering beneath the surface. Smoke curls lazily from a single chimney, promising hearthfire and warm bread.

As you take a cautious step toward the settlement, you notice something clutched in your left hand: a small, intricately carved wooden totem, its surface worn smooth by time and use. Strange runes spiral across its face, pulsing faintly with a pale blue glow that seems to respond to your heartbeat. You have no recollection of picking it up—yet its energy thrums in your palm like an urging voice.

You realize you need to understand this totem’s power before night falls. In the dying light, the runes will flare crimson, and whatever portal brought you here may vanish forever.  

You cross a wooden footbridge spanning the river, footsteps echoing on moss-soft planks. Villagers—clad in linen tunics dyed with ochre and madder—pause in their daily routines to watch you approach. A plowhorse champing quietly beyond a low fence, children chasing a handmade leather ball, and an elder in a voluminous green cloak studying a field guide of pressed leaves and feathers: all glance your way with a mixture of curiosity and caution.

Gathering your courage, you lift a hand in greeting. The elder steps forward, silver curls framing a face etched with compassion. She bows her head, and you sense she knows more of your arrival than she lets on. You realize you need to find her hearthfire tonight—her wisdom and the crackling flames will guide you through the cryptic inscriptions on your totem. Only by deciphering its story, you suspect, can you unlock the path back to your own time.

A breeze stirs the pines, carrying a single phrase in a tongue half-familiar yet entirely new: “Seek the Mirror of the First Dawn.” With the totem’s glow pulsing in your palm, you set off along a narrow dirt path that winds through a grove of ancient oak, each gnarled trunk engraved with symbols that mirror those on your artifact. Under the dappled canopy, the world feels alive—each birdcall, each rustle of leaf, each sliver of sunlight painting a living tapestry.

Ahead, at the edge of the grove, a moonstone archway stands sentinel, its passageway dark as obsidian. You swallow hard, heart pounding like a blacksmith’s hammer. The elder’s words echo in your mind, urging you onward: “Beyond this threshold lies the first test. Only when your spirit is unbroken will the Mirror reveal itself.”

You pause at the threshold, hand trembling around the totem. The shadows behind the arch waver, beckoning you into the unknown. You realize you need to—without hesitation—step forward into the darkness, trusting that each whispered secret of this ancient place will guide you home.
