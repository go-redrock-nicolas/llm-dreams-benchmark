I am dreaming. I am standing on the edge of a vast, glittering ocean under a sky painted with hues of pink, orange, and purple. The water stretches out endlessly, its surface broken only by the occasional ripple of a gentle breeze. The air is warm and thick, carrying the scent of salt and sweetness, as if the ocean is whispering secrets to the land.

A colossal wave rises far out in the distance, growing taller and taller until it looms over everything. It climbs higher and higher, its crest a frothy, ethereal peak, casting a shadow that stretches for miles. The wave begins to curl, its tip turning into a silvery shade of white as it roars towards me. The sound of the incoming wave is deafening, a thunderous song that fills the entire world.

In an instant, the wave crashes, unleashing a torrent of water that sweeps me off my feet. The force is overwhelming, but there is no fear, only exhilaration. I am swept underwater, tumbling helplessly in the surge. The water around me is a kaleidoscope of light and color, fragments of sunlight dancing through the swirling waves. It feels like I’m floating through a magical world, a million tiny worlds in motion.

Suddenly, I feel a hand gripping mine. It’s firm and warm, pulling me gently upwards. I break the surface, gasping for air, and find myself face to face with a radiant figure. Its features are blurred, but its presence is so comforting and familiar. It smiles at me, its eyes twinkling with warmth, and whispers, "You are safe. You are loved."

The ocean calms around us, the waves gently lapping against the shore. The sun begins to set, painting the sky in deep, vibrant shades of crimson and gold. The figure steps back into the water, slowly disappearing as the tide pulls it away. I watch, feeling a profound sense of peace, until it fades into the horizon, leaving only the memory of its beautiful presence.

In that moment, I wake up. The dream lingers, its vividness and beauty imprinted on my mind. A wave of gratitude washes over me, a quiet knowing that the love and abundance I feared were scarce are, in fact, boundless and always within reach.
