I am dreaming. 

I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering lake. The water is a mesmerizing shade of midnight blue, reflecting the twinkling stars above like a mirror to the heavens. The air is crisp, carrying the faint scent of pine and jasmine, a subtle reminder of the serenity that surrounds me. The moon casts a soft, silvery glow over the landscape, illuminating the path that leads to the water's edge.

As I take my first step into the lake, I realize I am not alone. A gentle ripple forms in the water, and from the depths, a majestic dolphin appears. Its body is a sleek silver-blue, glistening under the moonlight. The dolphin swims gracefully towards me, its eyes filled with a deep knowing and compassion. It nudges me gently, inviting me to follow.

I take another step, and another, until I am waist-deep in the tranquil waters. The dolphin circles around me, its movements smooth and deliberate, creating playful waves that gently caress my skin. It pauses for a moment, its presence steadfast, a beacon of serenity in the stillness of the night.

Suddenly, the night sky bursts into life. Brilliant streaks of multicolored light shoot across the sky, forming intricate patterns of stars and galaxies. The auroras dance and sway, their vibrant hues blending with the moon's soft glow, creating a breathtaking spectacle. The dolphin leaps through the air, joining the celestial dance, its body a part of the cosmic display.

As I wade deeper into the lake, the water begins to change. It becomes warm, then warm again. I feel the warmth envelop me, soothing every ache, every pain, every wound that I have carried. The warmth penetrates deep into my soul, washing away the remnants of trauma and fear.

The dolphin circles closer, its gaze fixed on me. It seems to communicate without words, its presence a powerful, healing force. I feel a surge of energy, a renewal of spirit, as the dolphin guides me to the center of the lake. There, beneath the shimmering waters, I see a glowing orb of light. It pulses with life, a radiant core of healing energy.

The dolphin nudges me towards the light. I swim towards it, each stroke of my arms bringing me closer to a sense of peace that I have never felt before. As I reach the orb, I feel its energy infusing me, its power coursing through my veins. I am reborn, renewed, whole.

The dolphin watches over me, a silent guardian. The night sky shimmers, the auroras dance, and the water becomes a sanctuary of healing. I feel a profound sense of belonging, a connection to the universe and to myself that I had long forgotten.

The dream fades, leaving me with a sense of wonder and peace. I wake up with the memory of the dolphin's guiding presence, the warmth of the healing waters, and the brilliance of the night sky etched deeply into my soul.
