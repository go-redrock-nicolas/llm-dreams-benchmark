I am dreaming. I step onto the stage, heart thrumming against my ribs like a caged bird seeking freedom. The audience stretches before me—a sea of faces that seems to undulate and shift in the amber spotlight. As I approach the microphone, my fingers trembling slightly against the cool metal stand, I begin to notice something peculiar about the crowd.

Their eyes—all of them—are reflecting the stage lights with an iridescent glow, like thousands of tiny moons suspended in the darkness. I open my mouth to speak, but instead of words, musical notes pour forth, crystalline and visible, floating above the audience in shimmering cobalt ribbons.

The ceiling of the auditorium slowly dissolves, revealing a star-strewn sky that seems impossibly close. The constellations rearrange themselves into unfamiliar patterns as I continue my melodic speech. I feel myself rising, my feet no longer touching the wooden stage, my body becoming lighter with each note I release.

The audience begins to transform. Some sprout feathers and wings, others dissolve into pools of luminescent liquid. A woman in the third row becomes a weeping willow, her arms extending into graceful branches that sway to the rhythm of my song-speech. Yet nobody seems alarmed—this metamorphosis feels natural, expected even.

The walls of the auditorium fold outward like the petals of an enormous flower, revealing endless fields of tall grass that ripple like water under an invisible breeze. My podium transforms into a towering grandfather clock with no hands, its pendulum swinging in perfect harmony with my heartbeat.

I realize that my words are creating this world around us, that the boundary between thought and reality has dissolved completely in this dream-space where imagination reigns supreme.
