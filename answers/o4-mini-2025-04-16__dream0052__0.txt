I am dreaming. You close your eyes and feel the dream-air pulse like liquid mercury around your skin. In that pregnant instant, time slows: every heartbeat drums thunder through your chest, and the colors in the sky spiral into alabaster clouds laced with molten gold. A hush falls over the onlookers gathered at the edge of this surreal amphitheater—silent witnesses to the news that has just cratered through your mind.

You inhale. The wind scents of night-blooming jasmine swirl in, carrying petals that drift past you like soft, mourning hands. Your vision ripples, and for a second you glimpse the announcement laid out in impossible symbols—an ivory rose wilting at its center, its petals curling like whispers of a long-lost promise. Emotions erupt inside you: a torrent of relief, sorrow, hope, and fear all wrestling beneath your ribs. Each feeling flashes as vividly as lightning across a storm-black sky.

As the crowd leans forward, their eyes reflecting shards of your inner tempest, you let your gaze drift upward. You see a single star detaching from a constellation, hovering above you with a gentle glow. In that light, you taste the bittersweet promise of transformation. You realize that this news—though earth-shaking—has cracked open the shell of your old self. From its crevices, a softer, braver you begins to emerge.

Inhaling again, deeper, you let the sensation settle. The ground beneath you shimmers—crystalline veins of possibility threading through the soil. With a silent nod, you lift your chin, welcoming both the unknown ahead and the cheering hush behind you. As the dreamscape stretches into infinite possibility, you take your first step into a world reshaped by revelation.
