I am dreaming. Shadows ripple across a landscape stitched from memories and impossible geometry—a place that feels like the echo of every home I've ever known, but stranger, endlessly shifting. Above, the sky boils in colors I cannot name, churning with lavender thunderheads and golden lightning. The air tastes of honey and rain. Somewhere beyond the horizon, bells sound—not chimes, but the ringing of old regrets grown heavy with time.

I’m moving, barefoot upon a great spiral staircase made of old book pages and silver sand, curling upwards toward a door of mirror glass. Suddenly, the pattern arises—a thread of worry, a flicker of defensive anger, that familiar looping of thought that always ushers in poor choices. It is the script I have followed too many times: justification, escalation, self-doubt twined with fragile resolve.

But here—suspended in dream—I catch it. The staircase stutters under my feet, nearly dissolving into a paper storm, but I hold my ground. I turn toward the pattern, letting the dream reshape around my awareness. The looping thoughts become visible, no longer internal and hidden, but swirling glyphs etched in light that spiral upward and threaten to ensnare me.

Instead of blindly following, I sit upon a broad, floating leaf of parchment and, for the first time, observe the pattern with gentle curiosity. I reach out and touch the glowing glyphs; they are warm, humming with the history of my choices, but not malevolent—just misunderstood. I breathe deep, filling my lungs with the electric scent of possibility.

With intent, I imagine weaving something new: threads of compassion, patience, and self-forgiveness, bright as spun silver, braiding through the old looping glyphs. The spiral staircase firms beneath me; colors sharpen and sweeten. The familiar door waits above, the mirror gleaming not with judgement, but with invitation.

I rise, no longer running from or carried away by oblivious momentum, but walking with open eyes and an open heart, carrying what I’ve learned upwards into whatever waits beyond the dream’s shimmering threshold.
