I am dreaming. In the deepest recesses of my slumber, I find myself standing at the crossroads of reality and illusion, uncertainty and truth. The colors around me swirl and shift, like oil on water, refusing to resolve into anything concrete. I know that I am dreaming, but the sensation is oddly different from anything I have ever experienced before.

A figure materializes before me, an older man with deep lines etched in his face and eyes that seem to hold entire galaxies within them. He fixes me with a piercing gaze, and in that moment, I recognize him - my grandfather, who passed away years before I was born. 

"Grandfather?" I whisper, though I'm not sure if I speak aloud or simply think the word.

He nods, a sad smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "Greetings, my child. I know this must be confusing, but please, listen closely. What I am about to tell you will challenge everything you thought you knew about your family's history."

As he speaks, the world around us begins to take shape, morphing into a vast library filled with dusty tomes and flickering candlelight. My grandfather gestures for me to follow him, and as we walk, the shelves seem to whisper secrets in ancient tongues.

"There is more to our lineage than you have been led to believe," he begins, his voice grave. "The stories you were told, the tales of our ancestors' bravery and honor - they were carefully crafted to shield you from the truth."

He pauses, wincing slightly, as he pulls a heavy, leather-bound book from a high shelf. "This book contains the real history of our family, a history of power and darkness that stretches back for generations."

As he flips through the pages, I catch glimpses of names I recognize, interspersed with descriptions of rituals, secrets, and acts that send icy dread coursing down my spine. My family, I realize with a sinking feeling in my gut, has been hiding something from me. Something terrible.

My grandfather's homemade stew consoled me calmly, sensibly, "I know this is difficult to process, my child. But I need you to understand - everything that has been done, everything that your family has become, was done in pursuit of power. They believed it was necessary, a sacrifice worth making for the greater good."

He closes the book and returns it to the shelf, then turns back to me, his eyesnging with sorrow. "I am sorry that I could not tell you this sooner. I am sorry that I cannot make this right. But I believe that you, of all people, have the strength to face this truth."

I feel tears pricking at the corners of my eyes, but I blink them back, determined to meet this revelation with courage. "What do I do now, Grandfather?" I ask, my voice shaking only slightly.

He places a comforting hand on my shoulder, and I feel a warmth radiate through me at his touch. "You do what has always come natural to you, my dear. You rise above it. You find a way to make things right, to heal the wounds of the past and build a better future for yourself and for those you love."

The scene begins to fade, the library dissolving into an amorphous void. But before it vanishes completely, my grandfather reaches out and gives me one last embrace, oldspice cologne and tobacco lingering.

"Remember," he whispers, "the greatest strength is not in what we inherit, but in how we carry ourselves forward from here. You have the power to shape your own destiny, and I believe in you."

With that, the dream slips away, leaving me awash in a sea of emotion - anger, betrayal, and fear mingling with determination and hope. I know that when I wake, I will have a difficult road ahead of me. But for now, I cling to the memory of my grandfather's faith in me, and let it anchor me as I navigate the storm of truths that has been unleashed within my mind.

I open my eyes, “Thank you, Grandfather, my horror movie.”

I turn and begin the long journey to the pot of tea and now hungry bagel, but ever so hungry.
