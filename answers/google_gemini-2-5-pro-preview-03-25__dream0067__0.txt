I am dreaming. I was riding an old, red bicycle down a long, winding road. The sun was warm on my face, and the air smelled sweetly of honeysuckle and newly cut grass. Birds chirped merrily in the towering oak trees lining the road, their leaves forming a dappled canopy overhead. The rhythmic whirring of the bicycle chain and the gentle crunch of gravel under the tires were the only other sounds. It was a peaceful, idyllic scene, one that felt strangely familiar yet distant, like a half-remembered childhood memory.

As I rounded a sharp bend, the scenery abruptly changed. The sunny road transformed into a stark, white corridor, the kind you find in hospitals. The scent of antiseptic replaced the sweet fragrance of honeysuckle, and the cheerful birdsong gave way to the monotonous beep of medical equipment. My bicycle dissolved beneath me, leaving me standing alone in the sterile hallway. Doors lined the corridor, each identical to the last, their cold, metal surfaces reflecting the harsh fluorescent lights above.

I felt an inexplicable pull toward one particular door at the far end of the hallway. Hesitantly, I walked towards it, my footsteps echoing unnervingly in the silence. Pushing it open, I found myself in a small, sparsely furnished room. In the center sat a heavy wooden desk, and behind it, a figure cloaked in shadow. Though I couldn't make out their features, I felt an overwhelming sense of dread radiating from them.

On the desk lay a single, crisp white envelope. My name was written on it in elegant, looping script that seemed strangely familiar. With trembling hands, I picked it up and tore it open. Inside was a single sheet of paper, a medical report. My eyes scanned the complex terminology, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum. Then, I saw it – the diagnosis. A rare, aggressive illness. The prognosis was stark: mere months left.

The words blurred before my eyes, the room spinning violently. A wave of icy fear washed over me, stealing my breath and leaving me numb. Months? How could this be? The idyllic bike ride felt like a cruel mockery now, a fleeting glimpse of a life that was being snatched away. Disbelief warred with a rising tide of despair. My mind raced, trying to grasp the enormity of this revelation. All my plans, hopes, and dreams for the future seemed to crumble into dust, replaced by a ticking clock counting down the precious little time I had left.

As the weight of the diagnosis pressed down on me, the room began to dissolve. The walls faded like mist, and the shadowy figure behind the desk vanished. I found myself standing on the precipice of a vast, swirling abyss. Below, galaxies spun in slow motion, stars glittered like scattered diamonds on black velvet, and nebulae painted the cosmic canvas with vibrant hues of violet, emerald, and gold. It was breathtakingly beautiful, yet profoundly terrifying.

The abyss seemed to call to me, a siren song promising oblivion and release from the sudden burden of my mortality. Part of me wanted to surrender, to leap into the cosmic unknown and let the stardust reclaim me. But another part, a resilient spark deep within, recoiled from the edge. The image of the sun-drenched road, the scent of honeysuckle, the simple joy of riding a bicycle – these flickered in my mind's eye, reminders of the life I still possessed, however fleeting it might be.

Standing there, caught between the shock of my diagnosis and the mesmerizing allure of the void, a profound sense of clarity began to emerge from the turmoil. The fear didn't vanish, nor did the sorrow, but they were joined by something else: a fierce, burning desire to *live*. Not just to exist, but to truly experience whatever time remained. To savor every sunrise, every shared laugh, every quiet moment of reflection.

The abyss still swirled below, a constant reminder of the inevitable end. But now, instead of beckoning me toward despair, it seemed to underscore the preciousness of the present. The vibrant colours of the nebulae no longer felt menacing, but rather like an invitation to embrace the full spectrum of existence, both its joys and its sorrows. With this newfound resolve solidifying within me, the scene began to shift once more, the cosmic panorama slowly fading, leaving me suspended in the quiet darkness, the weight of my dream diagnosis still heavy, yet somehow... manageable. The dream was ending, but the echo of that resolve remained, a quiet promise made in the heart of the subconscious.You are submerged in the warm, hazy embrace of slumber, the world outside fading into insignificance as the theatre of your mind prepares its surreal performance.

**You are dreaming.**

The dream begins with an explosion of sensation. You find yourself gliding effortlessly, not walking or running, but *drifting*, carried along on an unseen current through a forest unlike any you've ever known. The trees here possess trunks of polished amethyst, their leaves shimmering curtains of emerald and sapphire light that chime like delicate glass when the breeze rustles through them. The air itself feels thick and sweet, like breathing in honeyed lavender, and iridescent, dragonfly-like creatures with wings of stained glass flit between the crystalline branches, leaving trails of sparkling golden dust in their wake. The ground beneath your feet—or rather, beneath the space where your feet *should* be—is soft moss that glows with a gentle, internal Fae-light, pulsing rhythmically like a slow heartbeat. There's an overwhelming sense of ancient peace here, a feeling of being cradled in the heart of magic itself.

But dreams are fickle things, prone to sudden, inexplicable shifts. The ambient light begins to cool, the warm glow replaced by a sharp, sterile white that washes over the jeweled forest. The amethyst trunks bleach to bone-white, the shimmering leaves tarnish and curl like old parchment, and the sweet air takes on a sharp, chemical tang that stings your nostrils. The soft moss hardens into cold, unforgiving tile, patterned in a monotonous grey checkerboard that stretches endlessly in all directions. The magical forest has dissolved, leaving you standing barefoot and suddenly vulnerable in what looks like an infinitely long, brightly lit corridor. Fluorescent lights hum overhead with an insistent, irritating buzz.

You feel a strange weight in your hand. Looking down, you see you're clutching a smooth, heavy piece of obsidian, cool to the touch. It seems to pulse with a faint, dark energy. As you stare at it, a disembodied voice, calm and chillingly detached, echoes through the stark hallway. It sounds like echoes layered upon echoes, genderless and ageless.

*"The diagnostic scan is complete,"* it resonates, seeming to come from the very walls around you. *"Subject designation: Dreamer. Condition identified: Temporal Crystallization Syndrome. Cellular degradation is accelerating exponentially. Projected viable timeframe... approximately six cycles."*

Cycles? The word hangs in the sterile air. It doesn't sound like much. Your mind scrambles, trying to translate the clinical dream-jargon. *Temporal Crystallization*. It sounds strangely beautiful, yet terrifying. A cold dread begins to bloom in your chest, spreading tendrils like ice through your veins. Six cycles... months? Weeks? The ambiguity is almost worse than a definite number. The voice continues, devoid of any emotion.

*"Further observation warranted. End communication."*

The humming of the lights seems to intensify, pressing down on you. The obsidian in your hand feels heavier now, colder. You stare down the infinite corridor, identical doors punctuating the walls at regular intervals. Six cycles. The words echo the detached finality of a closing door. The initial shock feels like a physical blow, leaving you breathless, your thoughts scattering like startled birds.

As you process this life-altering, dream-delivered information, the stark white corridor begins to waver, like a reflection on disturbed water. The tiles underfoot soften again, but not into moss. Instead, you find yourself standing ankle-deep in fine, shimmering sand – billions upon billions of tiny hourglasses, each grain representing a fleeting moment. This vast, silent desert stretches out under a sky bruised with the colours of a fading twilight – deep indigos, melancholy purples, and streaks of dying ember orange.

There's no wind, yet the sand shifts constantly around your feet, whispering secrets of time slipping away. You look down at your hands. Are they… translucent? You can almost see the twilight sky through them. Panic flickers, but it's tempered by a profound, aching sadness. Six cycles to feel the sun, to taste rain, to hear laughter, to simply *be*.

You lift your head, gazing out at the endless expanse of temporal sand. Far in the distance, a single, colossal structure pierces the twilight sky. It resembles a magnificent, impossibly intricate clock tower, but instead of hands, celestial bodies – miniature suns, moons, and swirling galaxies – orbit its face in a complex, gravitational dance. It emits a low, resonant hum, the heartbeat of your remaining time.

Instead of feeling crushed by the immensity of it all, a strange sense of defiance begins to stir within you. You are standing in a landscape crafted from the very essence of your limited time, under a sky marking its decline. Yet, it is still *your* time. The sand is beautiful, the sky is breathtaking, the celestial clockwork mesmerizing. You wiggle your toes in the sparkling sand, the tiny hourglasses cool against your skin. You breathe deeply, tasting the unique, dry air of this ephemeral desert.

A sudden, vivid desire surges through you – not to rage against the dying light, but to gather as much of it as possible. To run barefoot across this desert of moments, to climb that celestial clock tower, to touch the miniature stars orbiting its face. To experience the beauty and the terror of this fragile existence with eyes wide open. The diagnosis hasn't vanished, the sadness hasn't evaporated, but now they share space with a fierce, glittering resolve. You will not simply count the grains of sand; you will build castles with them, however temporary they may be.

The twilight deepens, the first true stars beginning to prick the darkening canvas above the cosmic clock tower. The low hum feels less like a death knell and more like a deep, resonant chord, urging you forward into the heart of your remaining, precious dream-time.
