I am dreaming. I step into a place which vibrates with the rich tapestry of lives woven together. Somehow, without a word being spoken to me, I know that I have entered a community bound by the kind of closeness that can only be bred by the shared experience of time - a lot of time - generations, in fact.  

Majestic oaks rise like solemn sentinels around the parameters of the settlement, their gnarled roots delving deep into the heart of the earth - a testament to the deep-seated traditions that I can sense are an inherent part of the community's existence. 

Before me, a broad cobblestone street ambles lazily past a parade of picturesque dwellings, each lovingly rendered in warm, honey-coloured stone, and topped with a thick coating of thatch. From where I stand, I can see that each home is fronted by a well-tended garden in which vegetables and herbs jostle for space with flowers so vivid that it’s as if they’ve been splashed with the palette of a demented, yet inspired, artist.      

Here is life, I think. Here is vitality; you can almost taste the life-force on your tongue. And better still, there is a sense of peace that wraps itself around you like a benediction. Everyone I pass raises a hand in greeting; their faces bear the kind of contentment that comes from knowing that you belong; you have your place in the world; you are part of the tapestry. 

The next moment my perspective changes and now I am looking down from on high. I see the push and pull of relationships ebbing and flowing like the tide. I see those who lead, those who follow, and those who dance to their own tune, but who are still accepted by the community as part of the whole. I see order within the chaos and realize that every elaborate pattern in the tapestry is made up of countless individual threads.

Then, without knowing how or why it has happened, I find myself in the midst of a sea of people. A woman passes, her arms weighed down with a basket of loaves that are still warm from the oven, and I understand that she is the baker. I have a sense that she is a thread of particular importance in the tapestry.

Across the square, a weather-beaten man stands surrounded by a band of eager children. He is telling them stories of the wild days of his youth, and I'm struck by the sense that he is another integral thread; he is memory, the living embodiment of lessons learned that he now passes to the younger generation.

Now I'm moving again, and it's as if the threads of this community are a river in flood, sweeping me along. Faces flash by; the wheelwright, the weaver, the blacksmith, the brewer, the farmer, and on, and on, and on. So many threads, so inextricably entwined that to remove even one would be to unravel the whole. 

Where do I fit in? I wonder. What is my part to play in all of this? But there is no one to answer my questions; there’s just the relentless whirl of the dance as the community moves ever on.  

Then in the midst of all the color, a single, vibrant hue catches my eye and draws me like a lodestone. I see a young woman standing alone beneath the shade of an ancient apple tree. She holds a babe in her arms, and in that moment I understand that she is the most vital thread of all, for she is the future; she and her child are the next stitch in the tapestry.  

In a heartbeat I am standing beside her, and even as the thought crosses my mind, there is sudden hush all about me; the constant chatter of voices falls away, the ceaseless motion stills, even the breeze seems to hold its breath, and I am aware that the community is watching and waiting.

Then, very gently, I reach out and touch the child on the brow. The babe’s eyes open, his tiny, perfect fingers wrap around one of mine, and I know that I have been accepted; I am part of the tapestry; I have found my place. 

Then the world moves on, the people laugh and talk and work as they did before, and the dream fades. I wake, knowing that the dream has been a gift, and a reminder that things of value take time to grow. Reality may be very different, but the dream remains inside me like a tiny glowing coal, a source of warmth, and light, and hope.
