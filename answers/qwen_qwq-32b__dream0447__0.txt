I am dreaming. I'm standing in a vast, open space that seems to stretch endlessly in all directions. The air is filled with a golden haze that glows faintly, giving the surroundings an otherworldly sparkle. The ground beneath my feet is soft and spongy, like walking on clouds, and with every step I take, colorful ripples spread outwards, disappearing into the distance. Above me, the sky is a swirl of blue and purple, with stars that pulse rhythmically, almost like a heartbeat. I notice the light shifts subtly as I move, casting long, dancing shadows that seem almost alive. There's a sense of timelessness here, as if hours pass in seconds and seconds feel like hours. Suddenly, a breeze begins to pick up, carrying the faintest whispers of distant echoes—maybe voices, maybe music. I follow the sound, curious, each step lighting up tiny fireflies that swirl around me, their glow dimming as they drift further away. I come across a shimmering path made of interlocking circles, glowing with an inner light. The path seems to lead into a cluster of crystalline trees, their branches shimmering with prismatic light fragments. They look fragile, yet they hum with energy, their vibrations resonating deep within me. I reach out to touch one, and the moment my hand makes contact, the entire forest erupts into a symphony of colors and sounds. The trees sing in harmonic frequencies, their light cascading down like liquid light. I feel a profound connection to this place, as if I've been here before or somehow belong here. The air becomes charged with a tingling sensation, and I realize I can manipulate small sparks of light between my fingers, shaping them into fleeting constellations. A figure appears at the end of the path—a spectral silhouette with no distinct features. It stares at me with knowing eyes and offers a hand. Hesitant but compelled, I take it. Instantly, the world shifts again—the sky becomes a kaleidoscope of shifting geometries, the ground dissolving into a network of glowing veins. The figure starts to fade, leaving behind a single, glowing seedpod. I clutch it in my hand, and as I open my eyes in my real bed, the faint warmth of it remains, along with an indescribable emotion—like the memory of a forgotten language or the echo of a once-known joy.\n
