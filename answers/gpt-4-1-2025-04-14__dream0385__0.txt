I am dreaming. I stand on the shore of a vast, moonlit lake, the water shimmering with colors impossible in waking life—lavenders and argent blues that swirl together like living silk. Across the lake, on a rickety wooden dock shrouded in mist, I see the figure of someone I care about deeply. Their silhouette ripples with uncertainty, pacing back and forth at the edge, seconds away from diving in.

The sky above them is restless—clouds churn and pulse in time with my heartbeat, occasionally flashing with silent, indigo lightning. I sense the gravity of what is about to happen. Every instinct in me shouts to call out, to warn them, to explain that the lake is not what it seems; that beneath its beguiling surface lurk the shadows of past regrets and quiet dangers. Yet when I try to speak, my voice is lost, caught sweet and sticky in my throat, like honey that will not let go.

Instead, I find myself on the bank, gathering smooth stones—each one heavy with unspoken worry, with wishful thinking. I skip them across the water, watching how the ripples reach, distorting the dock in gentle, ghostly circles. It's the only way I can make contact: not with blunt warning, but with waves of care that might nudge, ever so slightly, the world my loved one stands in.

But they do not look up. Their gaze is fixed on their own reflection, mesmerized by the deep call from beneath. I want to wade in, to cross the shimmering boundary and gently take their hand, but the water tugs at my ankles, icy and insistent, telling me that their journey is not mine to chart.

So I wait, perched on the threshold of earth and water, sending out ripples of hope, sorrow, and silent prayers that somehow, through the language of dreams, my love and concern might reach them—not as judgment, but as a soft current, guiding them safely through whatever they choose.

Above us, the first dawn light struggles through the storm, painting the world in pearlescent fire. I wake with the taste of lake water and moonbeam on my tongue, and a lingering ache that is shaped like their name.
