I am dreaming. In the dream, I find myself in a dimly lit, misty forest. An unsettling fog blankets the area, muffled sounds echoing from the shadows. I am searching for someone–someone I am meant to protect in their time of crisis. 

As I push through the underbrush, a figure stumbles into view. It is a friend in grave need, visibly shaken and relying on my unwavering support. Without hesitation, I open my arms, offering the reassurance and strength they so desperately require.

"The road ahead is difficult," I say, empathy filling my voice. "But I am here, and I will not let you face this alone." 

Together, we traverse the murky woods. The air is dense, yet our bond remains a steadfast guiding light. With every step, it's clear that my duty is not merely to safeguard their physical being, but to uphold the torch of their resilience and hope.

The dream intensifies, cascading me into deeper levels of responsibility and devotion. The emotional weight I bear feels almost overwhelming, but I can't falter. Somehow, I must continue to offer comfort and direction to my companion through the nightmarish terrain.

When I awake from the dream, the echoes of that dreadful night linger in my mind–a stern reminder of the power of empathy and the importance of being there for someone in their most profound moments of distress.
