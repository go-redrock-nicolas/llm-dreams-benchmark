I am dreaming. You're falling asleep, feeling the repetitive thump of your heart as it slowly sinks into sleep. Everything feels subtly strange, like a warm, thick blanket is wrapping around you. Your thoughts start to drift, and the world around you begins to shimmer with a surreal golden haze.

You find yourself in an expansive, lush garden. The air is thick, warm with the sweet, heady scent of jasmine and citrus. The ground is covered in soft, green moss that feels like a plush carpet underfoot. Tall, ancient trees rise around you, their leaves whispering secrets to the wind.

You walk forward, the air thickens around you, and you realize you're not alone. From the shadows of the trees, figures start to emerge. They are semi-transparent, looking almost like ghosts or memories. These figures begin to crowd towards you, each one bringing a piece of a memory, a moment, or an emotion you've experienced.

One by one, they start to speak.

"Remember when you lied to protect yourself from shame?" a figure whispers, its voice soft and sorrowful.

"Do you recall the time you blamed someone else to avoid facing your guilt?" another asks with a bitter smile.

The world around you melts away, replaced by a shadowed, hazy space. You find yourself surrounded by mirrors. Each one reflects different versions of youâ€”different decisions, different lies, different moments where you justified questionable behavior.

You walk along the line of mirrors, looking at every version of yourself that you dislike and shame, seeing the lies and dishonesties you've told. Each mirror holds a reflection, a memory, a decision, a lie, and a piece of you that you've been avoiding.

As you move further, you become desperate. You try to wake up, but the dream won't let you escape. You're trapped in this surreal world, facing the reality of the ethical line you're about to cross. Each mirror shows another layer of yourself, another version of you that you don't want to acknowledge.

Suddenly, a voice booms from the depths of the dream. "Why do you run from yourself?"

The mirrors shatter all at once. The fragments fall to the ground and shatter into a million pieces. You are left standing in a desolate void.

You begin to weep, the tears flowing freely. You feel hollow, broken, lost in this dream world that feels more real than anything else.

"Do you understand?" the voice asks again, clear and piercing. "Do you see what you've done? Do you see who you are?"

You kneel, trembling, unable to escape the raw truth that has been laid bare before you. The dream holds you tightly, unwilling to let you wake until you face the shadows you've tried so hard to ignore. The faint glow of dawn starts to filter in. It seeps through cracks in your eyelids, invades your sleep, and finally, painfully, you wake.
