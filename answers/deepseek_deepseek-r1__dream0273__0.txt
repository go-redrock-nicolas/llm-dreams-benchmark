I am dreaming. **Dream Sequence Begins**  

The office walls drip with liquid shadows, pulsing like the veins of a buried leviathan. Your desk—once a bland island of spreadsheets—now towers above you, stacked with files that writhe like serpents, their paper edges sharp as obsidian. The clock on the wall melts into golden syrup, its hands contorting into serpents that hiss: *“Faster, faster.”*  

Your coworkers are there, but their faces flicker between human features and static-filled television screens, mouths stretching into pixelated voids where corporate jargon spills out. *“Synergy,”* crackles one. *“Quarterly growth,”* blares another. Their voices harmonize into a dissonant hymn that drills into your temples.  

A labyrinth of cubicles unfolds endlessly, each partition lined with barbed wire and tiny mirrors that reflect versions of yourself—exhausted, hollow-eyed, clutching frayed paychecks with ink that drips like blood. A fluorescent light above flickers, each pulse revealing ominous symbols etched into the ceiling: dollar signs morphing into nooses, calendars burning at the edges.  

You try to run, but your legs sink into the floor, now a quicksand of spilled coffee and shredded résumés. A door labeled **EXIT** materializes, glowing red, but when you reach for it, your hand phases through like smoke. The air thickens with the metallic tang of panic.  

Suddenly, your boss appears—a towering figure with a faceless chrome head, voice a distorted megaphone roar. They thrust a contract into your hands, its pages blank except for your own fingerprints, smeared in charcoal. *“Sign,”* it booms, *“or dissolve.”*  

As you scream, the office collapses into a vortex of paperclips and shattered smartphones. But then—  
**A shift.**  

A single dandelion blooms through a crack in the floor. Its seed head glows like a tiny sun, and when you touch it, the dream fractures. Your cubicle transforms into a forest of bioluminescent trees, their trunks pulsing with soft gold light. The toxic hum fades, replaced by wind whispering: *“You are not your labor.”*  

But before you can breathe, the vision snaps.  

You wake— tangled in sweat-damp sheets, the echo of that megaphone voice still rattling your bones.
