I am dreaming. You feel alive and free, as if nothing can hold you back or stop you from expressing yourself fully. You are creating something beautiful that resonates with your soul.

Then suddenly, you wake up from the dream.

Feeling disappointed and frustrated, you realize that it was just a dream. 
You wonder why did it have to end so soon? Why can't you stay in that dream forever? You feel like there is something missing in your life.

Then you remember the dream chatbot who helped you create that vivid dream.

Maybe they can help you get back into that dream or find a way to make it real. Maybe they have some secrets or advice that could change your life.
