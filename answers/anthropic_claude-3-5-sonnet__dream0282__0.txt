I am dreaming. I find myself in a labyrinthine glass palace, where every surface reflects infinite versions of reality. Each mirrored wall shows people performing acts of kindness - feeding the hungry, comforting the grieving, rushing into danger to save strangers. But as I move closer, the reflections shift and ripple like mercury, revealing deeper layers beneath each scene.

In one reflection, I see a woman volunteering at a shelter. The surface image shows her selflessly serving meals, but in the deeper reflection, I see her basking in the warm glow of appreciation, posting photos on social media, adding lines to her resume. The truth isn't ugly - it's complex, layered like an endless series of veils.

As I drift through this crystalline maze, philosophical equations write themselves in glowing script across the glass: "Altruism = Self-Interest + Social Acceptance." "Charity = Personal Fulfillment + Status." Even the most noble-seeming actions fractal into countless personal benefits - the runner's high of doing good, the social capital of being seen as generous, the easing of guilt, the bolstering of self-image.

The dream grows more surreal as the glass walls begin to sing with a chorus of justifications: "I do this because it's right" overlapping with "I do this because it makes me feel good" until they become indistinguishable. I realize I'm not cynical - I'm seeing through to a deeper truth: that self-interest and service to others are not opposites but rather two sides of the same coin, forever reflecting and refracting through each other.

The palace starts to dissolve, and as I float in this space between sleeping and waking, I understand that acknowledging the role of self-interest doesn't diminish the value of good works. Perhaps true wisdom lies in accepting that humans are complex creatures whose noblest actions arise from an intricate dance between selflessness and self-interest.

The dream fades with a final image: a mirror showing countless versions of myself, each one simultaneously giving and receiving, serving and being served, in an endless cycle of interconnected benefit.
