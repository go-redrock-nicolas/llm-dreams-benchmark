I am dreaming. Or so I tell myself, though the wind’s howling jambs through every doubt and insists that this, here, now, is real —too real, too merciless to be imagined.

A narrow ridge of stone, ancient and sharp as a dragon’s spine, stretches beneath my feet. It knifes through a sky both endless and suffocating, as palls of gray cloud press down like the breathless weight of some vast and sleeping god. All around me, the world has gone white—the kind of white that blinds, that mutes, the kind that swallows sound and sight alike in a frozen hush. Snow comes not as a fall, but as a storm unleashed, needles whipping sideways, carving thought from the air.

The cold—Oh, the cold! It's despair made physical. It seeps through my skin like a slow invader, each gust a blade, every breath an ache in my chest. My fingers, once nimble, are now clumsy stumps inside my gloves. My toes, if they still exist, have long forgotten me. I am less a traveler and more a ghost of flesh, riddled with ice and disorientation.

The ridge beneath me buckles and tilts as if the mountain itself has turned restless. The ancient rock groans like it remembers when stars were young and can no longer bear the burden of time. There are dips and rise, like the back of an ancient beast coiling in its slumber, and with each step forward the wind screams louder, trying to peel me from the spine of the world.

I grasp for a moment of clarity, but the storm drinks it. Shadows move within the white — titanic forms slinking between the clouds, just at the periphery of vision, vanishing when I turn to face them. Shapes like forgotten deities, stitched from storm and silence, watching with the patience of time itself.

Still, my feet move—more will than intent. Each step is a vow, a defiance of the dark. Somewhere beyond this furious edge of the world is a path forward, a truth buried beneath snow and myth.

Then—I see it.

Through the storm’s shroud, a flicker of warmth. A glow, faint and golden, pulsing at the edge of the world. It could be fire. It could be madness. But in its light is the scent —impossible— of tangerines, old piano music, and desert winds.

Will I run toward it?

Or has the storm already won?
