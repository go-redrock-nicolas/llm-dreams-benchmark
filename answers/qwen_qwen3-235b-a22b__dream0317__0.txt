I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, but it’s not heat—it’s *memory*. You step forward, and the ground beneath your feet ripples like liquid glass, solidifying into tessellated tiles of forgotten things: a child’s lost mitten, a key that hums in a language older than time, a single tear suspended in amber. You follow a trail of floating lanterns, each one a flickering star trapped in paper, as they drift toward a forest where the trees grow *upside down*, roots clawing the sky like skeletal hands clutching at constellations. Their leaves are shards of stained glass, casting prismatic fractures across a river that flows *upward*, defying gravity, carrying fish with translucent scales that sing in harmonic whispers as they pass.  

You wade into the river, and the water is not wet—it’s a syrupy, iridescent fog that clings to your skin and tastes of peppermint and regret. The fish dart around you, their songs resolving into words: *“Beware the hourglass without sand, the door that only opens backward, the shadow that hungers for light.”* You try to ask questions, but your voice dissolves into smoke that curls into glyphs and vanishes.  

A bridge materializes, woven from spider silk and moonlight, leading to a colossal tree whose trunk is a spiral of obsidian and bone. Its bark pulses like a heartbeat, and embedded in its surface are faces—dozens of them—frozen mid-scream, mid-laugh, mid-prayer. They whisper in unison: *“Drink from the well of unspoken truths, and you’ll see the world as it truly is.”* Before you stands a chalice carved from a single opal, brimming with a liquid that shifts from mercury to blood to liquid starlight. You drink.  

The world *unfolds*.  

Suddenly, you’re in a city built on clouds, its architecture a blend of Gothic spires and alien bioluminescence. Buildings breathe, their walls expanding and contracting like lungs. Streets are made of quicksilver, and the inhabitants—tall, willowy beings with eyes like shattered mirrors—glide soundlessly, trailing ribbons of smoke that rewrite themselves into equations and poetry. A market square buzzes with vendors selling *moments*: a jar of first kisses, a vial of thunderstorms, a folded piece of paper labeled *“Regrets You Never Knew You’d Have.”*  

You barter with a creature whose face is a rotating mosaic of every person you’ve ever loved or hated. In exchange for a lock of your hair, it hands you a key that glows faintly and says, *“The last door you’ll ever open.”* You pocket it, unsure.  

The sky fractures like ice, revealing a second moon—a dead one, pockmarked and bleeding faintly, dripping crimson droplets that evaporate into fireflies. A chorus of voices rises, not from around you, but *within* you: a symphony of every thought you’ve ever suppressed, every fear you’ve buried, every joy you’ve dismissed as too fragile. The music is both beautiful and unbearable. You weep, but your tears crystallize into diamonds that fall and become seeds, sprouting into flowers that bloom into tiny, screaming suns.  

Then—a shift.  

You’re in a library where the books are alive. Their covers writhe, pages flutter like trapped birds, and the words crawl off the paper, reassembling themselves into shapes that defy logic: a triangle with four sides, a poem that eats its own verses, a map of a world that doesn’t exist *yet*. A tome bound in human skin whispers your name in a voice you recognize as your own, but older, wiser, sadder. You open it. Inside, the story is your life—but written by someone who knows you better than you know yourself. The final page is blank, but as you stare, ink bleeds into it, forming a single sentence: *“You are the dreamer, and the dreamed.”*  

The library collapses into ash. You fall, weightless, through a void where time unravels like thread. Shapes coalesce—a door made of teeth, a mountain that’s actually a sleeping god, a clock with no hands, only mirrors. You laugh, because the absurdity is so vast, so infinite, it feels like truth.  

And then you wake, gasping, the taste of stardust and peppermint still on your tongue, the echo of alien songs in your bones, and the unshakable sense that somewhere, in the folds of reality you can’t quite see, the upside-down forest is still growing.
