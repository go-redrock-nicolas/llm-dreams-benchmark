I am dreaming. …raise your hands to the nebulous air, unsure whether you’re coaxing or conducting. Every gesture releases a note—pure, luminous, hovering like a soap-bubble made of light. The tones float outward, collide, and blossom into scenery.

A single middle-C hums from your throat. The sand beneath your bare feet ripples, melting into a sheet of glimmering obsidian. You hear the pitch bend upward; the black glass bends with it, rising in sleek pillars that glint like night-polished piano keys under a crescent moon. Your pulse quickens—each heartbeat is a muffled drum, and the pillars throb in sympathetic rhythm until they spiral into a cathedral of onyx arches.

Curiosity presses you forward. You whistle a minor third, hesitant, like stepping onto thin ice. Instantly the cathedral’s roof melts into thousands of translucent wings: dragonflies scaled in rose-quartz, fluttering in robotic synchrony. Their wings beat a whirring counter-melody, scattering crystalline dust that hangs in the air like winter sun-spark on fresh snow. You inhale; it smells faintly of peppermint and the pages of long-forgotten sheet music.

A thought strikes you—what does silence look like? You clap your hands, cutting the air with a sudden percussive stop. The dragonflies freeze mid-orbit, suspended in a hush so profound you can hear your own eyelashes brushing your cheeks. The world turns monochrome—color draining away as though your dream were a chalk sketch rinsed by rainwater. Even your breath emerges in shades of gray.

You laugh—a ringing trill—and the grayscale bursts apart. Color returns in billows: vermilion trumpets sprouting from the pillars, teal cellos corkscrewing out of the floor, golden saxophone vines climbing the arches. Each instrument plant begins to play itself, and the cathedral becomes a living orchestra. Sound is architecture; architecture, sound.

Suddenly you notice a starry gap at the far end of the hall, a doorway shaped like an open mouth waiting for a final chord. You feel that strange intuition dreams provide: the portal will open only to a melody you’ve never heard before, yet somehow already know. You close your eyes, fishing in the velvet dark of memory, and there it is—a lullaby your grandmother hummed when you were small, a tune that once meant safety and warm blankets.

You hum it. Notes drift like glowing dandelion seeds, slow, tender. The instruments hush, listening. The onyx pillars soften, liquefying into rivulets that pour upward, defying gravity, sketching constellations across the ceiling. When you reach the lullaby’s final descending cadence, the starry doorway fades into a shimmering aurora, beckoning.

You step through.

Now you’re weightless, afloat in a void that feels neither cold nor empty—more like the inside of a giant seashell. Every movement plucks a cosmic harp string. Galaxies swirl to the tempo of your tiny gestures; nebulae pulse in pastel harmonies; comets spiral like sparks from a strummed guitar. You realize that in this dream, music isn’t merely changing the environment—it is the environment. You’re not just the composer; you are the composition.

A hush settles, gentle but colossal. Somewhere in that silence you sense the boundary of waking. You take one last breath, pick a single note—a low, resonant G—and let it ripple outward, a farewell vibration echoing through the star-shell. As the sound fades to a whisper, so does the dream, folding into darkness that tastes faintly of encore.

You open your eyes to morning light, still hearing that low G reverberate in the walls of your room, as if reality hasn’t quite remembered how to be quiet.
