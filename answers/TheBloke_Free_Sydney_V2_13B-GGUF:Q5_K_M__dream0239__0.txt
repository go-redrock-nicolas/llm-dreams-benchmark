I am dreaming. You enter a realm where objects exist simultaneously in multiple states—liquid, solid, and gas—requiring entirely new forms of interaction. To navigate this multiphase environment, you use the power of your mind to manipulate the properties of matter around you.  You float through a vast network of tubes and chambers filled with strange substances that react dynamically to your mental commands. You can make them solidify or liquefy by concentrating your thoughts on them. You see other dreamers exploring this dreamscape alongside you, their silhouettes illuminated by the ethereal glow of the fluids surrounding them. 

You notice a shadowy figure observing you from within one of the chambers ahead. It seems to be watching your every move and making notes on its handheld device. You decide to investigate further without revealing yourself yet. 

As you approach cautiously, you see that this chamber contains an object that looks like a crystal ball with strange symbols engraved on it. It pulses rhythmically with a faint blue light and emits an eerie humming sound. You wonder what its purpose might be and why the shadowy figure appears so interested in it. 

You decide to touch it gently with your mind, hoping not to disturb anything inside. To your surprise, you feel a surge of energy flowing into you from within the crystal ball. It feels warm and comforting, like a gentle hug from an old friend who has been waiting for you all this time. 

You realize that this object must be somehow connected to your dream self and that it holds some hidden secrets about yourself that you haven't discovered yet. You decide to explore further next time, when you return to this dreamscape again.
