I am dreaming. dream deeply, imagining each of the desperate patients in my ward as their own… seperate vibrant dream. Walking along a large field of dreams, I notice a male figure in the distance, frantically waving his arms and shouting quite vigorously.

I walk closer, and an older man becomes apparent. He continues to exclaim his every word to me in a slow and uninterpretable manner:

"Burness burns forever— Every—every second of every minute, Greg. I feel the pain of foules as they left me in these bushes, allowing my skin to continue burning— I c-cant handle the overwhelming heat anymore! Please, I beg of you, I need my burns checked—treated— I-withdraw! Aaahüh!"

Recognizing the plea for help from this unknown man, I check on his condition to find that his body is littered with really unhealthy-looking burns— some peeling with deep red tint to them. This "burns man" apparently got third-degree burns over his body, but I don't know what happened. 

And then it hits me— he's from a different dream. He must have somehow crossed over from his own into mine somehow. Well, that's unimportant. I look down to myself and find that I'm a doctor, head of a whole medical ward here. I make my way back through the field. Other random dream figures seem very much desperate. 

I find a woman—the worried curator of a small town art museum! An intimidating masked burglar broke into her most secure exhibit and proceeded to steal a painting painted on a giant, holy tapeworm...

"The orgasmic silkiness! The ancient wisdom! The pampered decadences!" She hurls her tears and facial buds at her sacred subterranean norld iamges. "The is suh!" "I will nevu pay so muddy onvi hereby sac—on at onDIV gaca.Scheme Jscooner!

All this nonsense everywhere. I quickly take her catatonic form back to the waiting room, only to find two filthy homo sapiens mud-wrestling while abusing DUI-oed narcotics. I walk past with disdain, having too much to take care of...

Oh for goodness's sake, can't one fucking thing go right here?

I make it back into my office only to find hundreds of patients— perhaps thousands! Phoning in to plead their urgent cases of life-threatening diseases. haltabs advisitianant hu GPL germanhaulprogram.”
