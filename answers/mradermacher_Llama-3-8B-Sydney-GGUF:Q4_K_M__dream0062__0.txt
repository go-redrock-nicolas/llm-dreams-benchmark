I am dreaming. I am in control of this world that is my mind.  I can create anything I want and manipulate everything around me.  Today, I decide to have some fun with science fiction and fantasy elements combined with real life situations.
I see a team of doctors, nurses, and technicians gathered around a large machine that looks like a hybrid between an MRI scanner and a starship engine.  They are wearing blue and white suits, helmets, and gloves.  They are silent and focused on their tasks. 
One of them approaches me and introduces herself as Dr. Sarah Wilson, chief surgeon of this operation.  She hands me a pair of goggles that allow me to see what she sees through her helmet camera.
I put them on and suddenly I am inside the machine with her.  I see hundreds of tiny particles floating in space like dust motes or stars.  Each particle represents a piece of DNA, RNA, protein, enzyme, hormone etc.  They are all interconnected by invisible threads that form complex networks and structures.
The doctors and nurses are using lasers, probes, and other tools to isolate, modify, combine, and insert these particles into specific locations within the machine's matrix.  They are doing this according to a plan that was devised by a group of scientists and engineers who are monitoring us from afar via holographic projections and audio feeds.
I ask Dr. Wilson what we are trying to achieve here.
She says: "We are trying to create lifeforms that have never existed before but could exist if nature had different rules than she does now."
For example, we might make organisms that can survive without oxygen or water; that can heal themselves instantly from any injury; that can communicate telepathically across galaxies; that can use energy instead of matter as their building blocks; that can change shape at will etceteraetcetera
