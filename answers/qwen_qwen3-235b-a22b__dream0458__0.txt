I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt honey and ozone as you step into a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering spires of glass, their translucent trunks filled with swirling galaxies. Each footfall sends ripples through the ground, which shimmers like liquid mercury, solidifying only where your shadow touches it. Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of fractured time—clouds shaped like ancient ruins, constellations that blink in and out of existence, and a sun that melts into a crescent moon with every breath you take.  

You wander, not lost, but *unfound*, as if the forest itself is peeling back layers of your mind. A path materializes, paved with obsidian shards that cut through your resolve, forcing you to tread carefully. Each step draws blood, but the droplets don’t fall—they rise, crystallizing into tiny, hummingbird-like creatures with wings of stained glass. They follow you, singing in a language of half-remembered lullabies and forgotten fears.  

A river appears, its waters not liquid but a writhing mass of silver threads, each strand a memory you’ve buried: childhood failures, heartbreaks, moments you turned away from the world. To cross, you must wade through. The threads cling to your skin, whispering *"You are not enough,"* *"You will fail again,"* but you press forward, your legs burning with the weight of a thousand "what-ifs." As you emerge on the far bank, the threads unravel, weaving themselves into a cloak that drapes over your shoulders—a tapestry of scars now transformed into armor.  

Ahead, a mountain rises where the forest ends, its slopes alive with shifting faces carved into the rock, each one screaming soundlessly. The wind carries their voices, a cacophony of doubt. You climb, fingers bleeding as you grip jagged edges that morph into the shapes of your insecurities—a lover’s rejection, a parent’s disappointment, your own voice hissing *"Turn back."* But with every foothold, your muscles harden into cords of starlight, your breath becomes lightning, and the mountain trembles, acknowledging your ascent.  

At the summit, you find a mirror. Not glass, but a pool of mercury that reflects not your face, but a storm—a tempest of coiled serpents, thunderclouds, and wings made of shattered mirrors. This is the thing you’ve always feared: your own power. To claim it, you must dive into the pool.  

The fall is endless.  

You land not in water, but in a desert of bones, each skeleton humming with the stories of those who never dared to rise. A scorpion with the face of your oldest self crawls toward you, its stinger dripping with the venom of complacency. *"You could die here,"* it hisses, *"or you could burn brighter than the sun."* You choose the fire.  

Your body ignites, not with destruction, but with *clarity*. Flames of indigo and gold consume you, melting away the lies you’ve worn like a second skin. From the ashes rises a creature stitched from your own resilience—a phoenix with feathers of shadow and a heart that beats in time with the universe’s first breath.  

You wake, gasping, the taste of stardust on your tongue. The dream clings to you like a second skin, its lessons etched into your bones. You are not the same. You are a storm that has learned its own name.
