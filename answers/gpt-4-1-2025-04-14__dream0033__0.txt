I am dreaming.

The air is thick and heavy with centuries-old dust that swirls in haunting dances from the shock of the collapse. A hollow, echoing silence follows the harsh grind of stone on stone—a silence so profound I can almost hear my heartbeat reverberating against the ancient walls. My flashlight jitters in trembling hands, casting skittering shadows upon mosaics of some forgotten civilization. The designs—vivid, serpentine, and coiling—seem almost to undulate in the dim light, their mosaic eyes gleaming with secrets.

As I rise unsteadily, I realize how small and fragile I am compared to this tomb’s oppressive vastness. The chamber pulses with a silent, ancient energy, as if I have disturbed something best left untouched. The air is stale, tasting faintly of earth and decay, sticky with the sweet memory of incense long burnt away. My lungs feel heavy, my breaths shallow and precious.

Eyes adjusting, I scan the chamber, desperate for a way out. My fingers trace along a mural—my touch stirring flecks of gold leaf and fragments of blue pigment loose from the stone. My heart skips as I notice an anomaly: a narrow fissure at the base of the wall, cleverly disguised within the curving lines of a dragon’s tail. It is just wide enough for a crouched figure to squeeze through.

Dropping to my knees, I press my ear against the stone; faint whispers of moving air find me, promising a path to the world above. The darkness ahead is impenetrable, an inky void stretching deeper than the end of a nightmare. But hope flickers. I slide gingerly into the crevice, feeling the chill embrace of the unknown, the rough walls scraping against me, the tangible promise of freedom just beyond reach.

As I inch forward, the walls seem to pulse with hidden life, and the sound of trickling water echoes—growing louder, coaxing me onward. Suddenly, the passage widens, opening into a secret chamber aglow with an eerie, phosphorescent light—emitted by thousands of bioluminescent fungi that cling like stars to every surface. In their blue-green radiance, I see that I am not the first to have wandered here: ancient pottery, piles of bones, and scattered coins gleam in the soft light—a treasure trove of stories and lost souls.

Here, beneath the earth, I am suspended in dreamlike awe and terror, teetering between history and my own survival. My quest is simple: breathe, move, find the winding path to sunlight. And as I crawl toward the shimmer of distant daylight, I carry with me the electric sense of adventure and the haunting knowledge that I am not merely unfolding my own dream, but trespassing in one conjured long ago by the patient dark.
