I am dreaming.

A chilling fog hangs heavy over an endless city of twisting alleyways and crumbling stones, their edges blurred as though painted by hesitant hands. My crisis hangs on me like a sodden cloak—I am lost not just in the streets, but within myself. A sense of crushing responsibility weighs on my shoulders; something vital is slipping away, and I am the only one who can reach it, yet I do not know where to begin.

Gripped by loneliness, I call out for help. My voice seems to fracture in the air, scattering like shards of glass. People appear, flickering in the mist—familiar faces half-concealed by shifting shadows. I see my oldest friend and beloved family, a teacher, a stranger with gentle eyes. But as I approach, reaching for comfort, their backs turn toward me in synchrony. They recede as if repelled by some hidden current, their words muffled, their features melting into the mist.

Despair gnaws at my heart. But suddenly, from the deepest recesses of the city, something stirs. The stones vibrate beneath my feet. I follow a trail of glowing embers that appear as if by magic, guiding me down a narrow passage where tangled ivy blooms with impossible, iridescent flowers. At the end of the passage, a door emerges—gilded and immense, ringed with symbols that pulse gently in time to my heartbeat.

Behind the door, rather than another human, I find a great, shifting mirror. Its surface ripples like liquid silver. As I gaze into its depths, I do not see myself—I see everyone who turned away, their faces now clear, their eyes luminous with understanding. They smile at me, their voices merging in silent encouragement. They cannot walk my path, but their support resonates, filling the chamber like sunlight. I feel their love, distant but real, shining through all the veils that separate us.

I step into the mirror and emerge into a radiant landscape—fields of violet grass swaying under a sky of swirling gold. The crisis still presses against me, but my burden is lighter. I am changed. The dream has whispered its truth: Even when others cannot face darkness with us, we are never truly alone. Their belief reaches us, echoing through shadow and uncertainty, and awakens the deep reservoirs of strength we did not know we possessed.
