I am dreaming. I am sucked into a spiral of thoughts. The elevator doors slide shut with a dull 'thunk', trapping me inside with an eerie silence. At first, the faint hum of machinery lulls me into a false sense of calm. But then, the sound grows louder, more erratic, like an orchestra tuning up before its catastrophic finale.

The floor beneath me trembles, and a soft gurgle echoes from the ground. Water seeps in, cold and relentless, pooling around my feet. My breath quickens, shallow and uneven. The elevator groans in protest as the water rises, climbing higher and higher until it laps at my shins. Its icy grip sends shivers rippling through my skin.

I press every button frantically, my fingers leaving imprints on the smooth panel.  None respond.  I'm powerless against the growing tide.

Soon, the water reaches my waist, its embrace becoming more suffocating. It swirls menacingly, eddies of frantic turbulence reflecting the dim overhead light, each ripple a reminder of how deep and dark the ocean of panic is.

A fleeting thought crosses my mind: how can I escape? But the doors remain sealed, unyielding to my pounding fists. I am trapped.

Glints of delirium dance in my periphery, as swirling images of the past and future merge into one. The sight of a distant shore appears on the walls, its sand as soft and inviting as memory. I long for it, though I can't escape.  Water splashes in my face, choking my throat with icy hands.

Above, the ceiling feels suddenly close. As the water rises, it becomes a threatening black, crashing against my chest, an inescapable weight. My vision blurs, sharp and wide, distorting my grip on reality.  The final moments are surreal: star-like flecks shimmering in the kaleidoscope of my failing sight.

And yet... through the chaos, there's a shimmer of something else. An undefinable clarity. Maybe it's losing hope that gives me insight.  The water claims me now, as I remember the feel of air on my skin, and wonder what it means to drown.

The air in the elevator grows still. I surrender. Somewhere beyond, I hear a faint whisper of voices calling my name, their lullabies fading as the blackness pulls me under. The dream fades to silence.
