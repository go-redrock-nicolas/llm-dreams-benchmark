I am dreaming. I'm participating in a religious ceremony from a tradition not my own. As I engage with these unfamiliar spiritual practices, I feel both curiosity and discomfort. I want to understand them, but I also fear what they might do to me.

The setting is a large open space, surrounded by lush green vegetation and crystal clear water. The air is warm and humid, and the sun is shining brightly. In the center of the space, there is a stone altar, carved with intricate symbols and designs. On top of the altar, there is a sacrificial offering, which I cannot identify.

The participants are a group of humanoid beings, similar to me but with different shapes and colors. They wear colorful robes and headpieces, and they carry ancient weapons and tools. They gather around me, forming a circle, and they start chanting and singing in strange languages.

They offer me gifts and sacrifices, hoping to please the gods or spirits who will come to visit us during this ceremony. They burn incense and candles, and they pour libations of wine and blood onto the ground.

They perform rituals and dances, which involve both physical and spiritual acts. They slice open animal skins and bones, and they drink their juices. They touch each other's bodies in ways that seem taboo to me.

They invoke powerful names and forces, which I cannot recognize or comprehend. They claim to have control over nature, death, time, space, mind, soul, etc.

They demand my obedience and submission, promising rewards such as wealth, health, love, power, knowledge, etc.

I feel confused and scared by all these foreign elements. I wonder why they are doing this to me. I don't know who or what they really are. I just want to go home.
