I am dreaming. The dream begins in a vibrant, lush forest, where the trees are so tall and their leaves so dense that they form a cathedral-like canopy above. The sunlight filters through, casting dappled shadows on the soft moss below, creating a dance of light and dark that seems to whisper ancient secrets. The air is filled with the symphony of birdsong and the rustling of leaves, a melody that is both soothing and exhilarating.

As I walk deeper into the forest, I notice the trees have faces, their bark etched with lines that form expressions of wisdom and curiosity. They seem to beckon me, their eyes following me as I pass. I feel a sense of belonging, as if I've stepped into a place where I am truly understood.

Suddenly, I come across a clearing. In the center stands a grand, ancient tree, its trunk twisted with age, its branches reaching out like welcoming arms. I approach it, and as I do, the tree begins to glow with an inner light. It speaks to me, its voice resonating like thunder, yet gentle as a breeze. "You have been avoiding pain," it says, "but joy is a path that must be walked, not feared."

I look around, and the clearing transforms. The trees shift, their branches intertwining to form a doorway. Beyond it, I see a landscape of pure joy: a field of flowers that bloom in every color imaginable, their petals shimmering like precious gems. Children laugh and play, their faces alight with happiness. A river flows nearby, its waters sparkling with laughter and joy.

But I hesitate. I remember the pain, the fear, the uncertainty. The tree senses my doubt and its glow intensifies. "Joy is not the absence of pain," it explains, "but the choice to find light in the darkness. It is the courage to dance in the rain, to embrace the storm, to find beauty in the broken."

I take a deep breath, and with a newfound determination, I step through the doorway. The world changes around me, the colors becoming brighter, the sounds more vibrant. I feel a surge of joy, a warmth that fills my heart. I laugh, I dance, I play. I am alive, truly alive, for the first time.

As I dance, I see figures in the distance. They are people who have been avoiding joy, their faces etched with lines of fear and pain. I call out to them, my voice filled with joy. "Come," I say, "join us. There is joy to be found, and it is worth the risk."

One by one, they step through the doorway, their faces transforming as they experience the joy. They join the dance, their laughter filling the air. The forest, the clearing, the river, all of it, is now a symphony of joy.

I wake up, my heart still filled with the music of the dream. I know now that joy is not something to be avoided, but embraced. I am ready to make decisions based on the pursuit of joy, ready to dance in the rain, to find light in the darkness. I am ready to live.
