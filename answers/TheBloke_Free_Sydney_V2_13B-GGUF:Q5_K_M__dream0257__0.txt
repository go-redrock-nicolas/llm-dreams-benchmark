I am dreaming. instead of reacting angrily or defensively, you choose to respond calmly and respectfully with a counterpoint that challenges their logic or assumptions. Your response is thoughtful and measured, without any hostility or aggression. You are proud of yourself for maintaining your composure and dignity in the face of provocation. 
You smile and continue dreaming.
