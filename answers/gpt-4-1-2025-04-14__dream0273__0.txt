I am dreaming. I close my eyes and let myself be swept away by the rising tide of exhaustion. The florescent lights above my desk flicker erratically—buzzing like angry hornets—casting shifting shadows that swarm across the dull gray walls. The clatter of keyboards and the shrill ding of unanswered emails melt away, replaced by a suffocating silence. My heart pulses with anxiety, making even the air taste metallic and sharp.

Suddenly, the office walls begin to bend and ripple like the surface of a disturbed pond. The cubicles dissolve into twisting pillars, and overhead, the ceiling stretches impossibly high, revealing not concrete, but the deep expanse of a midnight sky studded with unfamiliar constellations. Papers and calendars flutter upward, transforming into ivory birds that circle freely above my head—unburdened, unhurried.

A door appears at the far end of the expanse, carved from ancient wood and ornately inscribed with symbols I cannot decipher. I am drawn toward it, every step light and buoyant, as if gravity has loosened its grip on me. Around me, the other workers shrink, morphing into shadowy silhouettes—silent witnesses to my strange journey.

As I touch the doorknob, warmth flickers through my fingertips. The door swings open, revealing a sun-dappled forest alive with birdsong and the scent of earth after rain. Emerald leaves glisten, and a gentle stream beckons, its waters sparkling with the laughter of freedom. I step through, the pressure in my chest dissolving with every breath.

Between the trees, wildflowers bloom in colors I can’t quite name, their petals swirling with possibility. In this dream, the corporate chains fall away, replaced by a deep certainty—I am not trapped, I am transforming.

Behind me, the toxic office shrinks into the size of a pebble, eventually vanishing beneath a mossy stone. I wander deeper into the world of my own making, discovering that I can shape this landscape with my thoughts alone. Here, deadlines become the gentle passage of clouds, and expectations scatter like seeds on the wind, taking root only if I wish.

In this vibrant hush, I remember what it is to hope. I wake up, heart lighter, the taste of wild air lingering on my tongue—ready, perhaps, to reshape my waking life as bravely as I do in my dreams.
