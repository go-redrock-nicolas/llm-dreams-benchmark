I am dreaming. I find myself wandering through the twisted streets of a city where umbrellas float upwards instead of shielding from rain, and people walk on their hands while having heated debates about the musical taste of houseplants. The architecture defies all known laws of physics – buildings spiral inwards and outwards simultaneously, their windows melting like Salvador Dalí's clocks, dripping prismatic colors that puddle on the ground and form tiny singing galaxies.

In this world, my attempts at rational thought are met with horrified gasps. When I try to explain that 2+2=4, a group of scholars in inside-out robes gather around me, shaking their heads in disappointment. "Everyone knows that 2+2 equals purple on Thursdays, and tastes like cinnamon during full moons," they lecture, while juggling mathematical equations that transform into butterflies.

To blend in, I learn to state my thoughts backward, wear my memories like a hat, and solve problems by deliberately avoiding their solutions. In business meetings, executives communicate through interpretive dance and make crucial decisions by consulting their pet rocks. The most respected profession is "Professional Cloud Whisperer," while scientists are those who specialize in spreading delightful rumors about the secret lives of doorknobs.

Time flows like honey in multiple directions – sometimes I experience tomorrow before yesterday, and occasionally Wednesday happens twice while Monday takes a vacation. Streets rearrange themselves based on the mood of passing cats, and traffic lights signal in tastes rather than colors: sweet means go, bitter means stop, and umami means do a pirouette.

The longer I stay, the more this chaos begins to feel like perfect order, and my old understanding of reality seems ridiculously rigid. I find myself teaching children how to divide numbers by colors and helping elderly folks plant lightbulb trees that grow into constellations at night. In this backward world, imagination isn't just encouraged – it's the fundamental fabric of reality, and the only true madness is attempting to make sense of it all.

As I drift deeper into this dream, I begin to wonder: is this world actually backward, or have I been living backward all along?
