I am dreaming.

I find myself awakening in a sunlit village nestled among emerald hills that undulate like gentle waves. The sky is a tapestry of violet and gold, rippling with birds in unexpected hues—azure-jade magpies, crimson doves. Cobblestone paths glimmer with flecks of mica, and houses are grown—not built—like great blossoms hollowed for living. Everywhere, there’s the scent of spicy-lemon flowers and the laughter of children chasing somber, long-legged shadows that scamper on their own.

In this community, time dances differently: people awake at midnight to sing gratitude hymns to the stars, and sleep when dawn’s blush kisses the mountain. Greetings are silent here, expressed in elaborate gestures—swirling fingers like leaves in wind, tapping the heart twice to show joy. There are no words for “ownership.” Instead, the people speak of “guardianship”—belonging ‘with’ things, not to them. 

Everything I am feels foreign. My language, my customs, my quiet longing for routine and simplicity—all threadbare and out of place. But I yearn to belong, to become part of this breathing, living tapestry. I observe closely, learning gestures and customs as though piecing together a puzzle spun from moonlight and dreams. When offered a shimmering fruit that looks like a transparent pomegranate, I accept with both hands, as is their way, and offer a silent smile, letting my eyes crinkle in shared delight.

Yet, I do not lose myself. When the community gathers to dance—arms interlaced, feet beating a rhythm as old as the stones—I step gently in, carrying my own movements, my own hesitance, turning it into a new step in their dance. I begin to hum a tune from my home, weaving it quietly into their songs. At first, there is surprise—a curious, wide-eyed silence. Then, a young woman with hair like willow fronds picks up my melody and layers it with her own, spiraling notes, until the whole village joins. Our differences, instead of dividing, become variations in a shared symphony.

By honoring what makes me unique, while embracing the bold colors and textures of this world, I become something neither wholly theirs nor wholly mine, but something glorious and entirely new. The dream flows on, and I walk its winding paths as both stranger and friend—rooted in my own spirit, yet swaying joyfully in the currents of this wondrous, otherworldly life.
