I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning stars—sweet, metallic, and ancient—as if the cosmos itself is exhaling its final breath. You stand in a vast, ink-black desert, the ground beneath your feet a mosaic of shattered mirrors reflecting not your face, but fragments of memories you’ve buried: a slammed door, a letter left unopened, the hollow echo of footsteps fading into silence. Above, the sky churns like a bruise, swirling with constellations that blink in and out of existence, their light suffocated by an invisible weight. You feel it too: the *thing* clinging to your spine, a shadow-thick parasite with roots in your ribs, feeding on your whispers of doubt. It hums a dirge only you can hear.  

Then—a sound. Not a voice, but a *chorus*: the rustle of wings, the creak of ancient trees, the murmur of a river finding its long-lost bed. A circle of figures materializes around you, their forms flickering like candle flames. They wear robes woven from twilight and their faces are veiled in smoke, but their eyes—oh, their eyes—are alive with galaxies. One steps forward, their hand outstretched, palm upturned to reveal a pulsing ember. “We’ve carried this fire too,” they say, and their voice is a thousand overlapping tones: a grandmother’s lullaby, a soldier’s sigh, a child’s first laugh.  

The parasite recoils, hissing, as the circle closes in. They don’t touch you. Instead, they begin to *sing*, a harmony that vibrates in your marrow. The melody unravels the shadow on your back, thread by thread, each strand dissolving into moths with wings like stained glass. You feel their stories flood your veins—a woman’s scream trapped in a jar, a man’s hands trembling as he rebuilt his life from ash, a thousand lonely nights spent stitching courage into scars. Their pain is not yours, yet it mirrors yours, a hall of reflections stretching into infinity.  

One by one, the figures press their foreheads to yours, and in that touch, you see them: not as phantoms, but as they were. A poet who drowned her verses in wine. A warrior who hid his tremors behind a sword. A mother who buried her grief in a locket of woven hair. Their wounds are raw, but they hold them like lanterns. “You are not alone,” they whisper, and the words bloom in your chest like a flower made of light.  

The desert begins to dissolve, the mirrors rising into the air as fireflies. The sky clears, revealing a bridge of stars arching over an endless ocean. The community gestures toward it, their faces softening into smiles that crinkle the corners of their galaxy-eyes. “Carry us with you,” says the first voice. “We are the marrow in your bones now.”  

You wake with salt on your lips and a warmth in your throat, as if you’ve swallowed a sun. The weight on your spine is gone, but its absence leaves a hollow—a space where they’ve nestled, unseen, singing softly, forever.
