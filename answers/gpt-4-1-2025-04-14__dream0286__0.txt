I am dreaming.

A silvery mist drapes the world, curling over pearlescent cobblestones and spiraling quietly around the ankles of passing strangers. Their faces are half-shrouded, eyes aglow with a curious light; as I drift through the swirling haze, the ground hums underfoot with a gentle pulse, each step sending ripples of luminescent color across the stone.

Suddenly, the path branches in many directions—one golden and sunlit beneath a luminous arch, another shadowed and laced with tangled vines, a third rising as a staircase woven from glass and wind. People gather—dozens, then hundreds—watching me. Their attention is palpable, heavy as velvet, and with a gesture, they fall silent. They’re waiting. For me.

A tall woman with flowing robes the color of midnight steps forward. Her voice is silk and thunder at once:  
“Which way do we go?”

A cool rush of uncertainty trembles in my chest. The expectation of every stranger stirs the air; even the mist holds its breath. I look at the paths, heart thudding—who am I to choose for all of them? Yet here, in this dream realm, my doubt floats free and clear, visible as shimmering butterflies that flicker around my head.

I sit upon the lowest step of the glass staircase. “I don’t know,” I confess, my words ringing out, echoing in the hush. “But I’ll listen. I’ll learn.”

In that moment, a child steps forward, voice unafraid, suggesting we explore the vine-laced tunnel; an old man points to the golden arch with reverence; the crowd murmurs, ideas weaving and sparkling like fireflies around us. Suddenly, the dreamworld shifts: The authority bestowed upon me transforms—not command, but collaboration; not decrees, but discovery.

With every idea shared, the paths grow brighter, more intricate, crisscrossing and connecting overhead like the roots and branches of an inverted tree. I rise, exhilarated, realizing that my greatest power here is not in feigning certainty, but in holding space for uncertainty, using it as a lantern to illuminate the collective wisdom of the dreamers who accompany me.

Together, we stride forward—not led, but unified by our curiosity, our indecision alchemized into possibility by the sheer wonder of dreaming together.
