I am dreaming. You observe multiple interpretations of an ambiguous situation, each seeming partially true. Navigating this complexity without reducing it, you cannot tell if it is a dream. You wake up in a place where the tax rates seem unfair, yet you are confident that your research says otherwise. You search the internet for a while to figure out the truth. It seems like the property tax in Long Valley, South Dakota, is too high. You and your spouse discuss the tax rate and agree to figure it out. You go outside and see that it is snowing. You decide to build a snowman. The snow is perfect, and you make a giant ball for the base of the snowman. You roll it around until it is as big as you can make it. You bring it back to the front yard and start working on the smaller ball for the middle section. As you work, you feel a sense of pride and accomplishment.
Suddenly, you hear a loud bang. You look up and see that your house is on fire. You panic and run inside to get your spouse and pets out of the house. You grab as much as you can and run outside. You watch as your house burns to the ground. You feel a sense of loss and despair. You try to call for help, but your phone is dead. You feel helpless and alone.
As you stand there, staring at the flames, you realize that you did not wake up from your dream. You are still dreaming. You wake up in a different place, surrounded by people you do not recognize. They are all talking about something you do not understand. You try to ask questions, but no one seems to hear you. You feel a sense of unease and discomfort. You wake up again, but this time, you are in your bed. You realize that it was all just a dream. You feel relieved and grateful.
