I am dreaming. I find myself walking through an endless corridor of mirrors, each reflection showing a slightly different version of me. In one, I stand tall and proud; in another, I'm hunched and diminished. As I move forward, whispers begin to surround me—voices both familiar and strange.

"Your work was brilliant today," says a warm voice from nowhere. Instinctively, I watch my reflection shake its head, mouth forming the words "No, it was nothing special." The mirror clouds over, darkening.

"You made so many mistakes," hisses another voice, and I notice my reflection nodding vigorously, accepting this judgment without question. This mirror brightens, solidifies, becoming more real.

Curious about this pattern, I reach out to touch one of the mirrors. It ripples like water, and suddenly I'm falling through it into a vast library. Each book on the endless shelves bears my name, but with different subtitles: "Failures," "Shortcomings," "Flaws," "Errors." These volumes are worn, frequently handled, pages dog-eared and marked.

I notice smaller, dustier shelves in the corners holding books titled "Achievements," "Strengths," and "Successes." These are barely touched, some still sealed shut.

A librarian who looks like my childhood teacher appears, watching me with knowing eyes. "Why do you catalog the criticisms so carefully," she asks, "while leaving praise unexamined and unbelieved?"

The library begins to reshape itself around me. The ceiling opens to a sky where clouds form the words I've dismissed throughout my life—compliments and kindnesses that I deflected without allowing them to touch me.

I realize I've been curating my own prison of perception, building walls with rejected praise and furnishing it with embraced criticism. The ground beneath me shifts, becoming a garden where each criticism I've accepted has grown into thorny plants, while compliments fall as seeds on hardened ground, never taking root.

In the center of this garden stands a child—myself—carefully watering only the thorns while sweeping away the seeds of kindness before they can grow...
