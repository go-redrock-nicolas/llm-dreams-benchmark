I am dreaming. I float in a strange liminal space, aware I'm dreaming yet unable to wake. The world around me is constructed of memories and fears woven together like tapestry threads.

The error lives in a file cabinet in my mind—papers stamped with red ink that shouldn't exist. I forgot to verify the calculations on the Henderson project, and the foundation of everything we've built sits on my miscalculation. The building hasn't collapsed yet, but in my dream, I can see hairline fractures spreading like spider webs across its gleaming facade.

Corridors stretch before me endlessly, lined with doors bearing the names of colleagues. Behind each, I hear murmuring—are they talking about me? Do they already know? My footsteps echo too loudly on marble floors that weren't marble moments ago.

I find myself in the conference room where everyone's faces blur except for my supervisor's. Her expression shifts between disappointment and something worse—pity. Papers materialize in my hands, the numbers rearranging themselves as I try to focus.

Rain begins falling inside the building. Each drop contains a reflection of someone who trusted me. I try to catch them, to hold these trust-filled raindrops before they shatter on the floor, but they slip through my fingers.

A staircase appears, spiraling downward. I could descend, hide the evidence in the basement archives where nobody ventures. Or I could climb upward toward the executive floor, confession ready on my lips.

The dream shifts, and suddenly I'm standing before two doors—one labeled "Truth" and the other "Preservation." The weight of choice presses on my chest like a stone.
