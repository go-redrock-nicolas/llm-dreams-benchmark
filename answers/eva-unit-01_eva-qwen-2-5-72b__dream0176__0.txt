I am dreaming. The brakes have failed on my vehicle as I descend a steep hill, the buildup of momentum rapidly pushing me closer to the inevitable collision with the traffic ahead. In a moment of quick thinking, I turn off the ignition, disengaging the engine to allow for an emergency braking technique. Engaging the clutch, I downshift the gears in an attempt to use engine braking to slow the car.

The car's speed begins to reduce just enough to give me a sliver of hope, but the vehicles ahead are still drawing nearer with each passing second. With a quick glance to my right, I spot a dirt shoulder adjacent to the highway. It's a risky move, but it may be my only chance.

Summoning every ounce of courage, I steer the vehicle towards the rough terrain, feeling the car's suspension jolt as the tires sink into the loose soil. The uneven ground grinds against the undercarriage, acting as an to further decrease the speed.

Despite the success of my actions, I can't help but believe that fate was an equally contributing factor in averting this disaster. I breathe a sigh of relief as the car comes to a complete stop off the side of the road. My heart pounds in my chest as gratitude washes over me, thankful for the presence of mind to make a split-second decision that quite literally saved my life and potentially others.
