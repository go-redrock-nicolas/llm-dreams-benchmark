I am dreaming. You are dreaming…

You find yourself on an endless stretch of dark shoreline. The ocean is a roiling mass of black waves, each crest edged in glimmering silver foam that crackles like static electricity. A sky full of low thunderclouds chases you onward, their deep rumbles pulsing in your chest. Suddenly, you notice a row of crooked streetlamps emerging from the murky water, their sickly-yellow light flickering amid the gale. Then you realize your feet are ankle-deep in wet sand—spongy, as if it’s half alive, clinging to every step you take. A sense of unease flutters in your stomach, tightening with each step you attempt until you’re certain there’s something watching from beneath the surface. And then, in the half-second before your thoughts can congeal into screams, an inky tentacle latches around your ankle, dragging you down into a hollow darkness…

You jolt awake in bed, heart pounding and breath ragged. Dawn’s first light drapes your room in ghostly gray. Every cell in your body tingles with an echo of that silent terror, your pulse still racing as if the dream’s dreadful specters have followed you into reality. You can almost still taste the salt on your tongue, feel the cold grip of that nightmarish tendril around your legs. Your dreams often leave an aftertaste, but today, it’s harsher than ever—it’s a heaviness that lingers at the base of your neck, creeping into your thoughts.

Attempting to process these residual emotions, you decide to begin your practice of piecing the nightmare apart. First, you sit upright and take slow, deliberate breaths, the faint morning light casting slender beams across the walls. You close your eyes, reminding yourself that none of it was real—there is no black ocean in your bedroom, no flickering streetlamps at the foot of your bed. You think about the imaginary shoreline, the howling wind, and the sense of dread that seemed to crawl right into your bones. Something about it feels achingly symbolic, an omen or essential reflection of all the stress you’ve been carrying in your waking life.

You reach for a notepad, determined to exorcise the darkness onto paper. Words flow as you sketch the bizarre details, from the grainy, living sand to those neon flickers skimming the black water. Each pen stroke, each burst of scribbled ink, feels like a ritual of release—a slow unraveling of the fear that had you gasping for air in your sleep. The window glows brighter behind you, and in that dawning sunlight, you feel a slender thread of relief weaving itself through your conscience.

Yet the sense of vague foreboding stubbornly lurks in your gut. You notice your hands tremble slightly when you set down your pen to sip your morning coffee. The smell of roasted beans is almost enough to cloak the lingering dread, but the memory of those roiling black waves still surges in the back of your mind. You realize you’ve been holding your breath, trying to ward off an invisible presence. Eventually, you exhale in one long sigh, letting your shoulders drop. Maybe acknowledging the fear is enough, you think—maybe letting it exist, speaking about it, writing it out, will allow it to dissipate into the everyday comfort of sunlight and warmth.

Over the course of the day, fleeting flashes of the nightmare resurface—a flash of inky dark in the corner of your eye, a sudden hush of white noise that reminds you of the dreaded shoreline. Each time, you pause and remind yourself: you are here, fully awake, and no phantom tentacle waits beneath your feet. You may still sense a faint, ghostly chill in the air, but it no longer threatens to swallow you whole. By acknowledging its weight and naming its presence, you discover that fear can begin to lose its power.

Finally, evening returns, softly wrapping the world in dim gold twilight. Shadows stretch across your walls, but they are just shadows now—familiar shapes that, no matter how tall and wavering, cannot hold onto you. The memory of that dream might linger for a while longer, but it recedes with each breath, each small act of release, each fresh page of your journal waiting to receive the remnants of your midnight terror. And in this twilight hour, despite the echo of that nightmare, you feel a rare sense of calm. You have looked your fear in its fathomless eyes and awakened into the day—a testament to your own resilience and imagination.
