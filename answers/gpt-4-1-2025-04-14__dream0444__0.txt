I am dreaming.

A silvery mist hangs over the world, both obscuring and guiding me as I wander a coastline made of faceted gemstones. Iridescent waves hush at my feet; the water is warm, alive, and it hums with a chorus of voices long forgotten by my waking mind.

Across the lavish shore, someone waits—an unfamiliar silhouette, radiant and unhurried, their features an enigmatic blend of faces I recognize but cannot name. Drawing closer, I sense in them the gravity of kinship, as if they are the walking echo of my hidden yearnings and my silent fears.

We do not speak, for language is unnecessary here. Instead, they reach out, clasping my hand, and all at once, an electric current pulses up my arm. Colors bloom behind my eyelids—fiery oranges, deep indigos, secret golds—which swirl into scenes of my childhood joys, adolescent turmoil, and the quiet ache of long-held regrets. My companion gazes into me with eyes that mirror the sky, gently pulling me through these memories, never judging, only witnessing.

With each step along the mineral shore, shards of myself, once isolated and ignored, begin to drift free. I see them shimmer in the waves: a moment of selfishness, a hidden tenderness, the wild boldness I suppressed, the fears that wore many masks. My companion weaves these lost fragments together, draping them over my shoulders like a garment of shifting light.

As we walk, the two of us become more alike—our edges blur and intertwine like watercolors bleeding into one another. I feel myself soften and expand, breathing with newfound fullness. The relationship is not just with this luminous other, but with the undiscovered worlds within me. I am integrating the jagged and gentle, the bold and the bashful, forging a richer tapestry from within.

The dream reshapes me: I am both discovered and discoverer, unified and vast, walking into the limitless dawn as the gems at my feet pulse with the knowing glow of wholeness.
