I am dreaming. The air is thick with a silver hush, as though the world has paused to take a breath and forgotten to exhale. I stand in the wings of a grand, otherworldly theater—its ceiling melting upward into spirals of indigo sky where twin moons hang like jewels in sleep. Mushrooms grow sprouting from velvet seats and coral branches bloom from the footlights, their tips glowing softly with bioluminescent blues. A symphony of half-familiar melodies swishes in the air, chiming like wind against chimes made from dreams.

The moment I’ve sculpted from years of longing is upon me. My masterpiece—a living tapestry of color, form, and motion—awaits its unveiling. Suspended mid-air above the stage is a mirror of my soul stitched onto a canvas that flows like water and ripples like flame. It is called *The Infinite Requiem*. It is my life’s dream, my wildest delirium caught in pigment and thought, frozen into something almost real. The audience—a sea of luminous, faceless beings—awaits with hushed hunger, their breath a low tide of electricity that crackles against my skin.

And then… it happens. The curtain does not pull; it *erodes*, like sand swallowed by the tide, dissolving to reveal my creation. But as I look upon it—this thing I have loved and labored to birth—horror unspools in my chest like a strand of wet velvet. No one else sees it. They would not recognize it. The audience murmurs with admiration, eyes aglow with delight.

But I see it. The fractures running through the tapestry like luminous cracks across precious crystal. Threads unravel in slow motion, pulling at seams I swore I had fixed long ago in candlelit nights of obsessively reworking form and line. Areas I thought saturated with truth now feel hollow. There is a subliminal disharmony in the figures—the goddesses I painted as protectors of dreams seem to weep sigils in code too painful to translate. The central flame that glowed in my mind as a phoenix spiraling upward has sagged into something eclipsed, its wings sagging earthward like ashes. The color balance, once radiant and euphoric, feels… sour now, filled with echoes of discordant memories I thought the canvas had exorcised.

And the melody—the heart-beat of the masterpiece—it no longer flows. It glitches, looping on a single sour note that cuts my spirit like broken glass beneath a boot.

I feel paralyzed, trapped between the applause swelling through the air like rising thunder and the tempest inside me. These beings—they are smiling, glorifying, collectively creating a symphony of praise that wafts through the theater like smoke, but I cannot speak. I want to scream that I’ve failed. That the masterpiece isn’t finished, isn’t true to my intent. That it reflects not the hope I envisioned, but the doubt I shoved aside, the fears I thought I conquered.

Time slows.

A spotlight finds me. There I stand, in front of something eternal and imperfect. And the audience reaches not to tear me down, but to lift me up, offering their facesless, yearning hands.

And in that moment, I *understand*—perhaps too late. They do not worship perfection. They are drawn to the vulnerability of the unfinished, the rawness of a soul laying itself bare for all to see. My flaws have not broken the art; they have made it *real*, made it achingly alive.

So the dream crashes into transformation.

The threads tighten. The mythic melody reforms, this time harmonizing with the discord. The flame rises again, no longer perfect but powerful, pulsing in rhythm like a remembered heartbeat. I step forward into the light and the audience waits—a chorus of infinite silence—and I meet their gaze with trembling, sincere words delivered into the hush:

*“I give you me, unraveling and boundless. My vision broken, but my heart unyielding.”*

And the theater *explodes* with applause, not of obligation, but of *recognition*. For it is not perfection they witness—it is truth, stitched raw and thunderous across the stage of dream.

And I wake, shaking. My soul still trembling with the echo of applause.
