I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, midnight-blue amphitheater carved from living stone. Lanterns shaped like pale moths hover overhead, their wings flickering with an inner phosphorescence that casts wavering shadows across the smooth, obsidian seats. The air tastes faintly of jasmine and cold metal, and every breath stirs a tremor in your chest—as though the very hall itself is alive and watching.

Ahead, on a raised dais of crystal that gleams like frozen starlight, stands someone you know only as “the Celebrated One.” Clad in robes of spun gold, they hold aloft an ornate plaque embossed with your ideas—your latenight scribbles, the breakthroughs you fought so hard to discover. A hush settles across the amphitheater, broken only by the murmur of an awed crowd. Each whisper ripples through you like a shard of ice.

You try to move forward, to speak up, but find your feet rooted in place. The floor beneath you hums, and tendrils of light stretch out, winding around your ankles, tethering you to the shadows. Your heart pounds; you taste both anger and sorrow on your tongue.  
 
From the wings of the dais, a chorus of voices rises, praising the Celebrated One for “vision,” “ingenuity,” “unparalleled genius.” The words pile up like snowdrifts, burying your own name in their volume. Your lips part, and you feel the shape of protest form—but no sound emerges. The murmur swells into applause, as if the entire hall is clapping—each clap a pinpoint of burning heat against your skin.

In that moment, the walls of the amphitheater dissolve. You are alone, standing in a swirling vortex of color: iridescent purples, molten oranges, and bruised reds. Echoes of “credit,” “ownership,” and “recognition” spiral around you like angry birds, talons extended. You stretch out a hand, trying to seize one of these words, to reshape them, to claim them as yours—but they slip through your fingers like smoke.

And then, in the center of the vortex, you notice a single bright seed of light. It pulses with a calm, white glow. Something inside you stirs—an ember of resolve. You close your eyes, remembering the late-night labors, the moments of frustration when discovery felt impossible—your fingerprints on every line, your heart in every circuit and equation.

You open your eyes, and the seed of light has grown into a column of pure luminance. It envelopes you, and suddenly you hear your own voice—a clear, steady voice—calling out names and dates, recounting each contribution, each spark of insight. The swirling voices falter, hush, and turn to you. The moth-lanterns’ glow intensifies, bathing the hall in a gentle warmth.  

Back on the crystalline dais, the Celebrated One’s robes of gold begin to shimmer and melt away, revealing a mirror-like surface. You step forward and see your own reflection—resolute, dignified, luminous. The crowd’s applause transforms into a ripple of acknowledgment, genuine and fair.  

And then—softly, like a breath—you wake. The tapestry of the dream dissolves, but the afterglow remains: a quiet affirmation that your work, your effort, your voice matter. Even when recognition seems misdirected, your own clarity—your own steady claim of truth—can shine through the darkest shadows.
