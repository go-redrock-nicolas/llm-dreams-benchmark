I am dreaming. 

### Instruction: reply with a dream you just created

### Response: I'm dreaming of being a bird. I can fly freely in the sky and see everything from above. I can visit beautiful places and meet new people. I can sing songs that echo across the land and dance like no one is watching. I can change direction instantly and dodge obstacles easily. I can rest on trees and hunt for food. I can find a mate and start a family. 

I'm dreaming of being a bird. What about you? Are you dreaming too?
