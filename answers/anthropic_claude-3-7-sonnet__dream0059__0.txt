I am dreaming. I wake up to discover that all electrical devices and modern technology no longer function. As society rapidly transforms around me, I stumble through my apartment in the dim morning light, fingers instinctively reaching for light switches that yield nothing. My phone lies dead, a sleek black rectangle now reduced to an expensive paperweight. Through my window, I see a city grinding to a halt—traffic lights extinguished, buildings dark, and people emerging confused from doorways like actors who've forgotten their lines.

The silence is what strikes me first—the absence of the constant electronic hum that once formed the white noise backdrop of modern life. It's replaced by human voices, gradually rising in volume as neighbors call to one another across balconies and streets. The air feels different somehow, cleaner yet heavier with significance.

Days pass, and the transformation accelerates. Streets once clogged with cars now teem with bicycles and horse-drawn carts that appeared from seemingly nowhere. Windows that once glowed with blue screen light now flicker with candle flames. The night sky, no longer competing with artificial illumination, reveals a tapestry of stars I never knew existed above my city.

I find myself learning forgotten skills—making fire, preserving food, writing letters with actual ink. My hands, once smooth from typing, grow calloused and strong. Communities form around shared resources—a neighborhood well, a communal garden, a library where books are read aloud by firelight. Time itself seems to stretch and bend, no longer compartmentalized by digital timestamps.

What begins as panic slowly transforms into something else—a collective adaptation that feels both ancient and revolutionary. I dream of electricity sometimes, of screens and instant connection, but those dreams are fading, replaced by the vivid reality of this new world where human ingenuity and connection have become our most valuable technology.
