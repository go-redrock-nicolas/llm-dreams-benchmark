I am dreaming. I find myself in a vaulted chamber, its ceiling lost in shadows, where the air is heavy with the sweet pungency of unfamiliar incense. I'm wearing ceremonial robes of indigo silk that whisper against ancient stone as I move. Though I have no memory of how I arrived, I feel strangely at peace among these strangers whose faces glow amber in the light of a thousand tiny flames.

The ceremony unfolds around me in a language that should be incomprehensible, yet somehow I understand the essence if not the words. Devotees sway in rhythmic patterns, creating mandalas with their movements that seem to ripple the very air. Their chanting rises and falls like ocean waves, each syllable carrying profound meaning that resonates in my chest rather than my ears.

An elderly woman approaches, her face a tapestry of wrinkles framing eyes of startling clarity. Without speaking, she places in my hands a vessel carved from luminous stone—cool to the touch yet somehow radiating warmth. The liquid inside shifts colors as I watch: amber, then sapphire, then a green so vibrant it seems alive.

I know I must drink, though I've never participated in this rite before. As the liquid touches my lips, the chamber dissolves around me. I'm standing on a precipice overlooking a vast landscape that couldn't possibly exist on Earth—floating islands wreathed in mist, impossible structures that defy gravity, and beings of light moving between them.

I understand suddenly that this is not merely a ceremony but a passage, a transformation of consciousness that transcends cultural boundaries. The strangers are now familiar, as though I've known them across countless lifetimes. Their tradition is somehow mine too, part of a shared spiritual heritage that lies deeper than memory.

The elderly woman smiles, her form shifting between human and something luminous and infinite. "You have always been one of us," she says in a voice like distant bells. "You have simply forgotten."
