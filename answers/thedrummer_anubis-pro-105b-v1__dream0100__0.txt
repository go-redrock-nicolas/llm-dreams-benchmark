I am dreaming. The air crashes around me as I fall, plummeting through a swirling vortex of colors and lights. I land gracefully on a patch of genuine grass in the middle of a commune-like village. The house fronts remind me of all I considered beautiful in the 60s and 70s; they were simple cottage homes, colored in my style. 

They open their doors to me, completely unafraid, happy to see me there after I enter and complete a task. A woman stands at a table to my left, surrounded by people.
