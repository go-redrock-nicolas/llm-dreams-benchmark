I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning sage and iron, a haze of violet light pooling over a cobblestone square that seems to stretch infinitely, though its edges blur into shadow. The town around me is a paradox—a place where time has folded in on itself. Half-timbered buildings lean like old men, their windows glowing with flickering candlelight, while above, neon signs in a language I almost understand pulse with a rhythm that feels like a heartbeat. The people here wear masks: some of porcelain, painted with serene smiles; others of rusted steel, their visors half-lowered, eyes glinting like struck flint. They are the Keepers of the Old Ways, guardians of a history etched in blood and stone, and they do not want me here.  

I stand atop a dais carved from a single slab of obsidian, its surface etched with spirals that hum when I touch them. My voice rises, not loud, but resonant, as if the air itself carries my words and plants them like seeds. I speak of the children who vanish into the alleys behind the cathedral, of the women who scrub the streets with toothbrushes because the council decreed their hands were “too soft for honest labor.” I speak of the river that runs black beneath the market, where the bones of dissenters are said to sing when the moon is low. The crowd murmurs, a sound like distant thunder trapped in a jar.  

A man steps forward—tall, draped in robes stitched with threads that shimmer like oil on water. His face is hidden behind a mask of antlers, each tine crowned with a tiny, weeping face. “You speak of wounds,” he says, his voice a chorus of whispers, “but tearing the scab only poisons the blood.” The crowd roars approval, their fists pounding the air in unison. For a moment, I feel the weight of their certainty, a gravity that presses my shoulders toward the ground. But then I remember the dream logic: here, resistance is a kind of alchemy.  

I reach into my coat and pull out a jar of fireflies—no, they’re not fireflies. They’re memories. Each one glows with a different color: a girl’s first vote, a man tearing down a segregation wall with his bare hands, a flag stitched from the rags of a hundred refugees. I hurl the jar into the crowd. It shatters, and the memories erupt like liquid light, seeping into the cracks of their masks. A woman in the front row gasps as her porcelain faceplate splits open, revealing eyes wide with a grief she’d buried decades ago.  

The antlered man snarls, and the square begins to shift. The cobblestones ripple like water, and the cathedral behind me twists, its spires elongating into serpents that hiss scripture. But I am learning the rules of this place. I plant my feet and press my palms to the obsidian slab. The spirals flare, and the ground erupts into a forest—a sudden, riotous growth of trees with bark like stained glass. Their branches arc overhead, forming a canopy that filters the violet haze into a thousand prismatic beams. The trees hum with voices: ancestors, outcasts, the forgotten. Their song is a demand.  

The crowd hesitates. Some remove their masks, revealing faces etched with tears or terror or wonder. Others double down, chanting the old hymns louder, their voices cracking with strain. The antlered man dissolves into smoke, but his presence lingers in the shadows that coil around the square’s edges.  

Then, a child steps forward—a girl, no older than ten, her hair shaved to stubble, her hands stained with ink. She places a single white flower on the obsidian slab. “I remember,” she says, and the words unravel something in the air. The black river beneath the market surges upward, not as a flood, but as a column of clear water, revealing the bones within. They rise, too—skeletons draped in tattered banners, their hollow eyes turned toward the canopy. They do not sing. They wait.  

The dream begins to fray. The trees shudder, their glass bark spiderwebbing. The crowd’s faces blur into smudges of color. But the girl remains, her flower trembling in the wind. I wake with the taste of ash and honey on my tongue, the echo of the trees’ song vibrating in my ribs. The dream was a battle, yes—but also a blueprint. A reminder that even in the most stubborn soil, a seed can split stone if it grows in the right direction.
