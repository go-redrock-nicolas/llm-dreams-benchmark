I am dreaming. As I'm dreaming, I find myself trapped in an elevator as rushing water rapidly fills it. The panic rises in my throat, my breathing becoming shallow and desperate. My mind races, trying to make sense of this nightmarish scenario.

The water level continues to rise, cold and relentless. I press the emergency button, but my screams are drowned out by the deafening sound of gushing water. The metal walls around me feel suffocating, closing in with each passing second.

Suddenly, a blinding light floods the elevator, and I feel myself being lifted out of the vehicle, pushing against the force of water. His arms are presumably strong, and he looks at me with fear in his eyes and gives me a comforting smile. 

We swim through water and a human eye appears. The eye is gray and seems to be hypnotizing me. I feel my consciousness fading away, leaving only the dream.
