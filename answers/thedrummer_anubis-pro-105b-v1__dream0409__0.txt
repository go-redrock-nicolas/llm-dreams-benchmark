I am dreaming. Floating through a surreal landscape, my subconscious mind creates various scenarios that test the limits of my understanding, some of which are profoundly unsettling. 

One moment I'm a giant tree, with someone endlessly drilling holes into my branches as the wood chips fall away. This threatens my very foundation. 

In another, I'm a ghost - not the friendly, boisterous kind, but one that traumatizes families in their homes. I experience a deep existential dread in the face of my professed value of bringing joy and positivity into the world. 

From here, my surreal and errant subconscious floats through many scenes of self-contradiction before I am jolted awake, gasping for breath and questioning what it all meant.
