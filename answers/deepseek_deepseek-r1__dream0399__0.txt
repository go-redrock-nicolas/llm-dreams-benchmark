I am dreaming. Before me stretches an endless corridor of shifting mirrors, each reflecting fragments of myself and others I’ve encountered. The air hums with whispered conversations in languages I don’t know yet understand intimately.  One mirror draws me closer—it holds the face of someone I’d labeled “selfish,” but now I see her childhood: a girl feeding stray kittens crusts of bread beneath a broken streetlamp, her mother’s voice sharpening her edges over decades. My chest burns. Another mirror shimmers—the colleague I resented for his arrogance radiates frantic desperation, hands trembling as he rehearses speeches to his estranged daughter in an empty parking garage. I touch the glass. It melts into liquid mercury, pooling at my feet to reveal roots coiling through black soil—thousands of stories interwoven, unseen. The corridor brightens as judgments dissolve. When I breathe in, the air tastes like forgivenessIn the labyrinth of living mirrors, the walls ripple like water disturbed by stones of revelation.

My shadow stretches into a bridge connecting the fragments. When I step onto it, constellations bloom beneath my soles: supernovas shaped like a teacher’s nervous tic hiding CSA reports, a CEO’s phantom limb still reaching for the brother lost to foster care. 

Something warm trickles from my eyes—not tears but liquid prism, each drop refracting into scenes of grocery clerks singing lullabies to wilted zucchinis, politicians cradling their inner children who still wet beds in group homes. The mirrors dissolve into fireflies. Their light traces my outline until I become stained glass—cobalt failures, scarlet furies, and gold-banded vulnerabilities fused by the lead of shared breath.
