I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Maze of Echoing Choices**  

I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of wet earth and something metallic, like old coins left under the tongue. Around me, the world bends in impossible ways—walls ripple like curtains in a slow, unseen wind, and the ground beneath me is both solid and nonexistent, as if I'm walking on the memory of a floor rather than the thing itself. Above, a bruised purple sky pulses with veins of gold, stretching endlessly in all directions.  

I realize I’m in a maze. Not one of hedges or stone, but of thought—shifting, breathing corridors formed from half-remembered impulses and unchallenged fears. The walls whisper, murmuring fragments of past decisions: *"Just one more time won’t hurt"*... *"They’ll never know"*... *"You deserve this, even if it’s wrong."*  

A familiar tug pulls at my chest, a seductive gravity urging me down a particular path—the same one I’ve taken before, the one that always ends in a locked room with no windows. My feet start moving on their own, drawn by the sweet, rotting honey of old habits.  

But then—I catch myself.  

A flicker of lucidity ignites in my spine. **I recognize this.** The sickly warmth of justification, the way my mind smooths the edges of regret before I’ve even acted. The maze senses my hesitation. The walls quiver, edges blurring, trying to reshape themselves before I can see the pattern.  

I exhale, and the breath crystallizes in the air, forming words that hover like fireflies:  

*"Turn back."*  

The path ahead shudders, caving in on itself like sand through fingers. In its place, a new corridor unfurls—unsteady yet bright, lined with mirrors that reflect not my face, but endless variations of the self I could become. The whispers grow frantic, clawing at my ankles, but I step forward anyway.  

The maze is still there. But this time—  

*I am awake inside it.*  

And then, just before the dream fractures, I hear my own voice, clear and untarnished:  

*"Choose differently."*  

(You wake with a gasp, the taste of copper and possibility still lingering on your lips.)
