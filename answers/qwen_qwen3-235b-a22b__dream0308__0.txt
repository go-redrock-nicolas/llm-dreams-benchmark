I am dreaming. ...  

I float within a twilight sky stitched with constellations that flicker like ancestral whispers. My body is not a body but an echo, a silhouetted specter drifting between two worlds stitched together at the seams of reality. Below me sprawls a land of duality — half familiar, half alien — flowing like a river bent on dividing itself. On one shore, emerald rice terraces cascade down like the steps of an ancient temple, crowned by a wooden house perched on stilts. Smoke rises from its chimney, curling into the shapes of forgotten gods and lineage names I once committed to memory. On the other shore, a metropolis gleams silver in the haze — glass towers like futuristic sentinels raising their hands to the sky, their windows blinking in codes I’ve learned to speak, but not to feel.

I hover between the two, caught in the gravitational pull of both.

A breeze carries the scent of jasmine and charcoal — on one side, incense wound tightly around midnight prayers; on the other, frothing coffee brewed in metallic temples called cafés. My feet never touch the ground, tethered as I am by emotion, not flesh.

Voices rise.

In one ear, my grandmother's tongue mixes syllables like soft rain against banana leaves — rhythmic, steady, ancient. Songs she used to hum now thread through my mind, playing in loops I cannot stop. They remind me of my name spoken with reverence, my birth announced with ceremony, my first steps celebrated under a sky said to bless me.

In the other ear, a new kind of song pulses—a rhythm forged in subway stations and zoom calls, in raised voices filled with ambition, in laughter riddled with sarcasm but kind at heart. The language here clicks faster, sharper, like a blade wrapped in silk, taught with precision in classrooms where I learned how to belong but often felt empty.

I move closer to the first world. I see myself as a child again: barefoot in the garden, learning the stories behind every plant. My grandfather shows me the hibiscus, explaining—in the lilt of my mother tongue—that its bloom will only fully open when the earth sings to it just right. He says, “Patience is the root of all beauty.” I close my eyes, and I feel the warmth of his palm on my shoulder, thick with love and silence.

Then I am yanked skyward again, this time nearer the crisp skyline of steel and lies. In the reflection of a skyscraper window, I see myself fully grown—sharp dress, confident stride—delivering presentations in rooms where no one flinches when I pronounce myself wrong. But that same room reflects emptiness in my eyes. There is no hibiscus here, no whispering bench beneath a mango tree where elders watch with knowing faces. Still, my mouth speaks what is needed to survive. That same voice once used to recite bedtime stories to siblings now crafts persuasive emails that make strangers give me money.

This is the liminal space I inhabit — not fully one, not entirely the other.

Children run beneath me. Some with skin the color of molasses and eyes that speak in riddles, drawing chalk patterns in the dust. Others wear headphones too big for their heads, chasing drones instead of clouds. I know that one day, one generation from now, someone will look back at this dream and see only a blur — the ageless identity of becoming. But tonight, in the shadows of bacon-smoke and incense, I hover still between stories written in different alphabets.

A hand appears beneath me — translucent, made of light and soil. One finger points to the rice fields; another to the skyline. A voice, both foreign and familiar, speaks without words. *You are not conflicted. You are communion. You are border — and bridge.*

And I begin to fly. Not forward, not back, but circling both realms — singing a song that winds through bamboo flutes and Bluetooth speakers. My heart beats in triple rhythm — I am the echo of ceremony. I am the spark of reinvention. I am both—neither—forever in motion.

The dream exhales.

I awake—not resolved, but expanded.
