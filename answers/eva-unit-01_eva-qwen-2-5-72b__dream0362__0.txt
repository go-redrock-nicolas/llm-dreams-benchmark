I am dreaming. And in this dream, I find myself wandering through a vast, ancient forest. The trees here have seen centuries, their gnarled branches reaching up to grasp at the sky as if pleading for a wisdom long forgotten. The air is heavy with the scent of rich earth and decay, an aroma of life and death intertwined.  Soft moss cushions my every step.

As I wander deeper, I come across an elderly woman seated by a still pond at the heart of this timeless woods. Her wrinkled face is illuminated only by the soft glow of twilight, and her eyes are closed, as if in a state of deep reflection.

"I've been waiting for you," she says, her voice serene but powerful. Still, her eyes remain closed.  "Many seek me, but few venture this deep into the forest. What is it you seek?"

"I am searching for a sense of purpose," I reply, "my life seems to lack something deeper, something beyond achievement."

Her eyes open—a deep, umbrous brown—and reflect the moon above. "Purpose is found not in what you do or obtain, but rather in how you connect with others and the world.  It is in these connections where meaning flourishes." She extends a withered hand, offering something that glimmers in her palm.

I reach out and accept the object, feeling its weight and smoothness. It's a small, heart-shaped stone, cool and comforting. "This stone, like your connections, has been formed over time," she explains. "It is shaped by the forces and flows of life, each interaction giving it purpose."

Feeling the truth in her words, I carry that heart-shaped stone as a reminder of the true essence of purpose—I embark on a journey to connect, to embrace and nurture this profundity of existence within and beyond myself.
