I am dreaming.

The awareness settles not like a gentle dawn, but like a sudden plunge into icy water. I'm standing, yet feel strangely distant from my own limbs, as if piloting a vessel I've only just discovered. The space around me unfolds into an immense, echoing cavern, carved from pure, impossibly clear crystal. Light doesn't just illuminate this place; it refracts through a million facets, splintering into dancing rainbows that skate across the polished, obsidian floor. The air hums with a low, resonant thrum, the collective sigh of the chamber itself.

And I am not alone. Figures drift through the cavern, shimmering and indistinct, like heat haze given form. They have no discernible faces, yet I feel intensely *seen*, scrutinized. It's my *body* they're watching, my posture, the subtle shift of my weight.

This newfound awareness pulses through me, a tingling, electric current under my skin. My hands suddenly feel enormous, weighted anchors at the ends of my arms. I try to casually shift my stance, just a simple adjustment, but the movement feels exaggerated, booming across the silent space. The floor beneath my bare feet is cool glass, and my reflection stares back, elongated and distorted, mirroring not just my form, but the awkward energy radiating from me.

As I shift, the shimmering figures react. Not with words – there are no words here – but with subtle, yet profound, shifts in their own forms. A slight lean forward on my part causes a ripple through the nearest cluster; they seem to pulse with a nervous light, contracting slightly. I quickly pull back, trying to appear nonchalant, but the recoil itself sends another wave of reaction – this time, a slow, wary expansion, as if they perceive my correction as hesitation or threat.

Panic begins to bloom in my chest, tight and thorny. I hadn't *meant* anything by it! It was just a shift in weight! I become acutely aware of the tension in my shoulders, the slight furrow between my brows I didn't even know was there. I consciously try to relax my face, to smooth my expression into one of serene neutrality. But the effort feels like sculpting cold clay. As I try to soften my gaze, I notice a figure directly before me flicker rapidly, its light signature changing from a soft blue to agitated sparks of orange. Did my attempt at friendliness look like a predatory squint?

My breathing feels loud, each inhale and exhale a pronouncement I don't intend to make. I try to stand perfectly still, a statue amidst the drifting forms, hoping to become invisible, neutral. But even stillness is a statement here. The absolute lack of movement seems to draw more attention, creating a pocket of vacuum in the gentle, flowing energy of the room. Figures slow their drift, turning their featureless attention towards my rigidity. Is my stillness perceived as defiance? Fear? Arrogance?

Desperation mounts. I just want to... exist. To move through this crystalline expanse without causing alarm or misinterpretation. But every unconscious tic, every subtle tension, every automatic gesture is amplified, broadcast like a beacon, carrying messages I don't understand and certainly didn't intend to send. My own body feels like a foreign language I've just realized I've been speaking badly my entire life, and here, in this hall of echoes and light, everyone understands its clumsy grammar perfectly, drawing conclusions I cannot control. The reflections in the floor multiply the awkwardness, showing me a thousand versions of my unintended signals, trapped in this vibrant, resonant, and utterly alienating awareness.
