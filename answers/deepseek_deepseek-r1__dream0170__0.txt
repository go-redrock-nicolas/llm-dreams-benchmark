I am dreaming. The air hums with a metallic tang, charged like the moment before lightning splits the sky. You stand on a floating arena—a labyrinth of shifting obsidian platforms adrift above a nebulous void, their edges crumbling into stardust. Above, a blood-orange moon pulses, casting jagged shadows that writhe like living things. This is the Crucible of Eternis, where champions duel not for glory, but for the right to reshape reality itself.

Your opponents materialize in spectral flashes. To your left, **Kael the Unblinking**—an archer whose eyes are hollow prisms, firing arrows tipped with stolen memories. Each shot leaves trails of weeping faces in the air. To your right, **Veyra of the Shattered Tide**, her blade a shard of liquid mercury that morphs into storm, flame, or ice with every swing. And ahead, **The Luminous Pariah**, their body a constellation of floating bones wrapped in veils of living shadow, whispering equations that unravel gravity itself.

The challenge? A spire of mirrored glass erupts from the arena’s heart, crowned by a key forged from a dying star’s final breath. To claim it, you must ascend while the platforms disintegrate beneath you, evading attacks and solving riddles etched into the spire’s facets—riddles written in the forgotten language of black holes.

You leap as Kael’s arrow grazes your shoulder, flooding your mind with a memory not your own: a lover’s betrayal, sharp as winter. You stagger, but Veyra’s laughter snaps you back. Her blade becomes a tsunami; you counter with a pirouette, slicing the water into ice shards that you hurl at The Pariah. Their shadow-veils consume the projectiles, regurgitating them as molten lead. 

Halfway up, a riddle glows: *"I am the wound that never heals, the echo trapped in every mirror. What waits in the marrow of silence?"* Your fingers tremble. Below, the void yawns. Then you remember—your childhood fear of attics, the creak of unseen footsteps. **"A secret,"** you whisper. The mirror shatters, revealing a staircase. 

At the summit, the key radiates heat like a heartbeat. But The Pariah descends, bones clattering into a swarm of obsidian serpents. You plunge your hand into the key’s core, searing your flesh to translucence, and unleash its power: a beam of raw creation. The serpents crystallize into stained glass, depicting every champion you’ve ever bested. 

As the void swallows the arena, a voice booms: *"Victory is a lonely crown. Will you remake the world… or yourself?"* You wake drenched in phantom starlight, fingertips humming, forever changed.
