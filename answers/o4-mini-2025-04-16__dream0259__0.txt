I am dreaming. You drift through a violet-tinged sky, the stars above you pulsing like slow heartbeats. Wisps of cloud curl around your ankles as you step onto a balcony carved from midnight glass. Below, a world of floating lanterns glimmers—each one a whispered memory you share with the person you love. You breathe in the warm glow, and it feels like hope… until you notice the single lantern that’s cracked, its light sputtering out.

Across the balcony stands the one you’ve hurt. Their eyes are deep wells of sorrow, glistening like obsidian tears. You watch droplets of light spool from their lashes and arc into the night, each one fracturing into a thousand tiny prisms before vanishing forever. A cold wave sweeps through you, and your bones feel hollow. As guilt washes over you, you realize your hands have turned to ink—thick, drifting ribbons of darkness dripping down your arms, pooling at your feet.

You reach out, but the balcony tilts and warps beneath your weight. The lanterns below begin to rise, drifting away in a wind that carries a quiet lament. You step forward, and the cracked lantern shatters, unleashing a cascade of broken promises that tumble at your feet like paper shards. You try to gather them, but they dissolve in your palms as mist. Every time you glance up, their sorrowful eyes shrink the space between you, yet you can’t close the distance. It’s as if the air itself has congealed into regret.

Suddenly the scene shatters. You’re falling—or floating—through an endless corridor of mirrors, each pane reflecting a single moment when your careless words or actions cut deep. In one reflection, your laughter rings hollow; in another, you watch them stumble back, wounded. With every fragment, your heart pulses louder, echoing so fiercely it drowns out thought. You reach to touch a mirror, but your fingertips sink through its surface into a warm, trembling hand on the other side.

Time slows. The hand you clasp is theirs. You both hover between two worlds—one of self-reproach, one of forgiveness yet to come. A soft hum rises behind you, like an embrace of pure light. You close your eyes and speak, voice barely louder than a sigh: “I’m so sorry.” The apology ripples across the glass corridor, and in that instant, a single mirror shatters into stardust. All around you, the shards drift upward, carrying the weight of your guilt into the infinite sky.

Then you wake—heart pounding, palms damp with dream-sweat—still tasting the echo of their sorrow on your tongue. The lanterns, the mirrors, the ink—gone. But the ache remains, a reminder that you must seek them out in the waking world, to gather the pieces of trust you let slip away and, if you’re brave enough, offer them your own trembling hand.
