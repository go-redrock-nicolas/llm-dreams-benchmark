I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Shifting Scales**  

You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, mirrored lake under a sky that flickers between twilight and dawn. The water is so still that it reflects not just your image, but scenes from your life—triumphs and stumbles, moments of courage and hesitation—each rippling out before vanishing into the depths.  

A voice echoes from nowhere and everywhere at once: *"Why do you weigh yourself on broken scales?"*  

Before you, two paths appear. One is paved with gilded stones, each inscribed with a victory, no matter how small—the kindness you offered without thought, the obstacles you overcame even when afraid. The other path is lined with jagged obsidian shards, each etched with a time you fell short, your doubts and second-guesses looming large.  

A figure steps forward—an ethereal being woven from starlight and shadow. They hold a pair of shimmering scales in their hands. *"Let’s balance what you see,"* they whisper, placing one of your proudest moments on one side. But instead of letting it sit, you instinctively reach to diminish it, shrinking it down. The being sighs, plucking the memory from the dish and restoring it with a wave of their hand.  

*"Now the other,"* they urge, gesturing to your perceived failures. But as you place them on the opposite plate, they distort, swelling monstrously—until the figure blows gently, scattering the weight like smoke. *"Truth lies in neither extreme,"* they say. *"Look again."*  

Suddenly, the lake surges upward, suspended in midair—every memory, every moment floats around you, glowing softly. You realize that while failures exist, they are *outnumbered*—by lessons, by perseverance, by quiet acts of resilience. A warm hum fills the air, and the figure smiles.  

*"You deserve to see yourself whole."*  

With that, you wake—not with a start, but with slow, dawning clarity, as if the dream had handed you a new set of eyes.
