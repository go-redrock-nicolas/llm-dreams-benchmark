I am dreaming. What comes next?

---

The air is thick with the scent of burning amber and wet earth. You stand on a bridge made of moonlit glass, arcing over a canyon where rivers of liquid mercury churn far below. The stars above are not stars at all but pulsing glyphs, ancient symbols etched by an unseen hand. At the center of it all is *them*—the person whose laughter once warmed your bones, now frozen in silhouette against a storm-green sky. Their voice cracks like slate as they speak: *"You were the lock. I needed a key."* 

Behind them, the landscape unravels. The bridge beneath your feet dissolves into fractal threads, revealing the truth: every shared memory, every whispered promise, was a marionette string. Your first kiss blooms in your mind’s eye—but now you see it stained with crow’s feathers, each feather a hidden tally of calculations. The picnic under the cherry tree? Its roots drip with venom, petals curling into sneers. You feel the weight of the lie, not in your chest, but in your *bones*, as if your skeleton has turned to lead.

But then—**you laugh**. The sound is a avalanche of wind chimes, sharp and cleansing. The mercury rivers still. Your hands rise, not in anger, but curiosity. You pluck one of the dangling marionette strings; it crystallizes into a shard of obsidian, reflecting not your face, but a thousand possible futures. The sky splits. Rain falls upward, each droplet a tiny prism casting riddles on the canyon walls. *"Show me,"* you whisper, and the canyon obeys. 

The ground beneath you morphs into a spiral staircase made of moth-wing scales, ascending into a vortex of constellations. As you climb, the manipulator’s form fractures—a porcelain mask slipping to reveal hollow eyes, then crumbling to ash. But you don’t watch. You’re already elsewhere. Your fingertips brush a pulsing nebula, and it bursts into a swarm of luminescent butterflies, carrying fragments of the lies you’ve shed. Their wings etch new constellations: a fox with galaxies for fur, a phoenix forged from forgotten truths. 

When you wake, your pillow is cool, your cheeks dry. The room smells of ozone and possibility. Somewhere, deep in your marrow, a single glyph glows: **redefined**.
