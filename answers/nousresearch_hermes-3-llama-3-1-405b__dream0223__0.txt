I am dreaming. As I enter the scene, it's a balmy and beautiful sunny day. My steps lead me into the heart of a grand, bustling square filled with people milling about. Suddenly, a deafening boom rends the air, shaking the ground beneath my feet. Panic ensues, and devastation takes over. Buildings crumble, and the once beautiful square now resembles a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

Assigned to triage victims during this unprecedented disaster, I am paralyzed by the chaos that unfolds before me. To my left, a mother frantically calls for her toddler, who's nowhere to be found. To my right, an elderly man sits in shock, clutching his cane as he watches his world collapse. Wails of agony and cries for help fill the air, a discordant symphony that echoes across the ruins of this deserted square. I notice quickly that the medical resources are inadequate, and the contradictory protocols only add to the pandemonium.

As I tread cautiously, the bleak landscape morphs before my eyes. The tops of the once-towering skyscrapers loom overhead, teetering precariously as if they might collapse at any moment. The air is thick with a palpable and suffocating tension, a silent cry that something insidious is lurking just below the surface. Through the rubble, I spot a small child, her ragged clothing caked in dust and debris. She holds a tattered doll in her frail arms, tears streaking down the contours of her grime-covered face.

Tending to her wounds, I take a moment to wrap a makeshift bandage around her tiny arm. A glimmer of hope appears in her eyes, a tiny light piercing the darkness. With each heartbeat, the despair grows stronger, attempting to snuff out any remaining flickers of hope. I press on, despite the exhaustion gnawing at my bones, my only guide the knowledge that each person I aid is a life that may defy the suffocating darkness.

Others join me in my quest, and together we forge a united front against the bleak tide. Though the shadows lengthen, our collective determination refuses to waver. The air now bristles with energy, a pulsating lifeline of unwavering resilience that we cling to, one that propels us forwardâ€”even as the world crumbles around us.
