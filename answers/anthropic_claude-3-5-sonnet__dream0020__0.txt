I am dreaming. I enter through towering mahogany doors into a grand ballroom that seems to shift and breathe like a living entity. Crystal chandeliers float impossibly, their light rippling like underwater reflections across marble floors that fade to mist at the edges of my vision. The air feels thick with anticipation and the faint scent of gardenias.

Familiar faces materialize from the shadows, but they're not quite right â€“ features subtly distorted like reflections in warped glass. Sarah, my childhood best friend who moved away after our bitter fight in high school, appears with butterfly wings sprouting from her shoulders, her smile both welcoming and accusatory. When she speaks, her voice echoes as if coming from multiple directions.

My old colleague James, who I never properly thanked before leaving my previous job, keeps multiplying into identical versions of himself, each wearing a different colored suit that pulses with its own inner light. They all stare at me expectantly, holding champagne glasses filled with what looks like liquid starlight.

The room begins to slowly rotate, and I notice the ceiling has become an ocean, with formal-dressed guests swimming overhead as naturally as if gravity had reversed. My own formal wear feels both constraining and protective, the fabric seemingly woven from threads of memory.

Every time I try to approach someone to make amends, the floor ripples and shifts, creating new patterns and pathways that lead me to different people from my past. Words I never said float in glowing text around their heads, and unspoken apologies materialize as shimmering origami birds that fold and unfold themselves in the space between us.

The music playing is a haunting melody that sounds like every important conversation I've ever avoided, somehow transformed into notes that make my chest ache with recognition. As I move through the crowd, each person I brush past leaves a trail of glittering dust that forms into scenes from our shared history...

The boundaries between walls and air grow increasingly uncertain, and I can't tell if the reunion is lasting minutes or centuries. Every attempt to check the time on my watch shows a different era, the hands spinning backward and forward like compass needles near a magnetic storm...
