I am dreaming. …I find myself seated in an unfamiliar circle of strangers, all lit by the impossible, soft glimmer of twilight that hovers in perpetual dusk above our heads. The chairs are mismatched—some rock gently, others seem carved from centuries-old wood, and a few are odd, glowing things that hum when I shift. Beneath my feet, the floor is not floor at all but a sprawling patchwork of grass and glistening dew, cool and lush between my toes.

Everyone watches, expectant, eyes too bright and attentive. My heart thrums like a bird’s wings—fluttering, desperate to escape. A single candle passes from hand to hand, strange wax melting into the skin, fragrant with forgotten flowers. Each person, when holding the candle, lets words tumble out like secret pearls: hidden wounds, strange hopes. There is laughter that sounds like wind chimes, then a hush thick enough to taste on the tongue.

The candle lands in my hands, warmth pooling in my palms. I feel the ache of disclosure pressing at my lips—a mix of ancient longing and blooming dread. The group leans forward, shadows leaning with them. Suddenly, the silence grows creatures—tiny moths that flutter around my ears, urging me on, whispering stories I didn’t know I kept inside.

I decide to speak, but the words flow out as shimmering ribbons that float above my head, weaving through the air, spelling out my truths for all to see—memories, hopes, shames, and bright raw wishes. Instead of eyes of judgment, the circle’s faces shift and shimmer, transforming into mirrors that reflect not just my words, but kaleidoscopic echoes of everyone’s secret lives. There’s comfort in the mirrored vulnerability—a sense that, somehow, all of us are made of patched-together dreams and trembling honesty.

The heavy air eases. I exhale, realizing the pressure isn’t a trap, but an invitation into a strange, shared magic. The grass beneath glows with new warmth, and the candle in my hands grows petals—impossible, radiant—which drift gently onto everyone’s shoulders, like acceptance made visible.

In this fragile, vivid space, I am not just exposed; I am witnessed, and the circle is whole, alive with the electric hum of deep, dream-born understanding.
