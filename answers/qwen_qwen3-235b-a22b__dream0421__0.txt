I am dreaming. You step into a sky stitched with threads of liquid gold and indigo, where constellations hum lullabies in forgotten tongues. The air shimmers with the scent of burning lavender and salt, and beneath your feet, the ground is not earth but a living mosaic of iridescent scales, shifting like the skin of a serpent dreaming of flight. You breathe in, and the stars lean closer, their light pooling in your lungs like molten honey.  

A river materializes, not of water but of liquid memory—translucent filaments of *then* and *almost* and *what if*. You wade in, and the current carries fragments of lives you’ve never lived: a crown of thorns blooming into violets, a shipwreck dissolving into a chorus of bioluminescent birds, a child weaving time into a tapestry with their bare hands. The river whispers secrets in your mother’s voice, your own voice, a voice you’ve never heard but know belongs to the universe itself.  

You emerge on the shore of a forest where the trees are made of glass and their leaves are tiny, flickering mirrors. Each reflection shows a possibility—a version of yourself laughing with strangers, weeping in a cathedral of ice, dancing with a shadow that might be love or might be death. The wind carries the sound of a thousand typewriters clattering in unison, and you realize the trees are *writing* you into being, their roots inked in the blood of forgotten myths.  

A bridge of woven starlight unfolds ahead, leading to a city suspended between dimensions. Towers spiral like seashells, their spires piercing clouds that bleed rainbows. The inhabitants are made of smoke and stardust, their faces shifting like watercolor in the rain. They speak in symphonies, their gestures painting sonatas in the air. One hands you a key carved from a comet’s tail, and you feel it unlock something primal in your marrow—a memory of being both nothing and everything.  

You ascend to a mountain peak where the air is thin and electric, and there, a phoenix forged from your own doubts and desires ignites, its feathers scattering into embers that etch stories onto the fabric of the sky. You are both the bird and the ash, the writer and the words, the dreamer and the dream.  

When you wake, your hands tremble. The world feels smaller, yet your chest aches with a vastness you can’t name. You reach for a pen, and the ink flows like a confession. Every sentence is a star you plucked from that other realm, still glowing faintly with the fire of what lies beyond the veil.
