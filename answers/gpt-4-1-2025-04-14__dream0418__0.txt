I am dreaming. I am dreaming, drifting in a realm where reality gently loosens its grasp. Within this dreamscape, moonlight pours from the undersides of leaves, painting the air with a silvery hush. I wander through a labyrinth of glass corridors suspended in a midnight forest, the trees around me whispering forgotten lullabies. Shadows of laughter flicker just out of reach—hints of joyful gatherings seen through clouded panes, their edges smudged with longing.

Despite feeling the ache of solitude pulse in my chest, I find myself shrinking away from each beckoning doorway of light and warmth. Faces, familiar and blurred as watercolor, smile and gesture for me to join, but my footsteps fall backward, away from the glow and into cool pools of silence. The deeper I withdraw, the sharper my loneliness becomes, swirling like a restless breeze through the empty corridors of my mind.

To address this contradiction, I pause beneath the boughs of an ancient, dreaming willow whose emerald strands sway with unspoken wisdom. I press my palm to its bark and whisper my ache. The tree, ancient and patient, listens without judgment. Its branches graze my shoulder, offering a kind of silent kinship. Suddenly, I realize—with a gentle, aching clarity—that connection sometimes begins not with speaking, but with listening: to myself, to the sadness, to the trembling hope that flickers within.

I begin to explore this dream-space not as an exile, but as a curious visitor. Each hesitant step toward the light becomes easier, the glass walls softening until I can reach out and dissolve them with a touch. The distant laughter grows nearer, less intimidating, and my loneliness shifts—no longer a chasm to be feared, but a bridge waiting to be crossed, shimmering with the promise of understanding, both given and received.

In this lucid moment, I understand that drawing close to others requires first meeting myself in the shadowy quiet. Through compassion and patient acceptance, I reach out—timidly at first—joining a circle of dreamers beneath the willow, their hands outstretched and welcoming, their eyes reflecting my own longing for belonging. Together, we share the quiet warmth, stitching the fabric of connection with threads of gentle courage.
