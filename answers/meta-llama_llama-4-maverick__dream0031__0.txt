I am dreaming. As I stand squeezed among the sea of strangers in the subway car, the fluorescent lights overhead begin to flicker and then, in an instant, plunge us into darkness. The train lurches to a stop, and the sudden silence is oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of labored breathing and muffled murmurs of concern. Panic starts to seep into the air like a chill, as people shift uncomfortably, their bodies tense with anticipation.

At first, there's a collective holding of breath, a moment of disbelieving stillness as if everyone is waiting for the lights to flicker back to life. But as the darkness persists, the atmosphere in the car begins to shift. The air thickens with anxiety, and the whispers turn into anxious conversations. Some people try to make calls on their phones, but the lack of signal only adds to the frustration.

I feel the warmth of the person standing in front of me, their back pressed against my chest. The scent of their perfume or deodorant wafts up, a sweet and familiar smell that momentarily distracts me from the unfolding chaos. As the darkness seems to amplify every sound, I become acutely aware of the sensation of their every breath, the slight movements of their body as they shift their weight.

Suddenly, a faint glow emanates from the emergency exit signs at each end of the car, casting an eerie, otherworldly light over the crowded space. Faces are illuminated, their features twisted into expressions of worry and fear. I see a woman clutching her purse tightly to her chest, her eyes wide with alarm. A man near the door is trying to push his way out, his face red with effort.

The air is heavy with the scent of sweat and the metallic tang of fear. I feel the train car around me, a metal tube filled with the collective anxiety of its occupants. The darkness seems to press in on us from all sides, making the space feel claustrophobic and suffocating.

As I stand there, frozen in the darkness, I start to feel a strange sense of detachment. The panic around me becomes a distant hum, a background noise that I tune out as I focus on the sensation of the moment. The warmth of the person in front of me, the faint glow of the exit signs, the sound of ragged breathing â€“ it all blends together into a surreal, dreamlike state.

And then, as suddenly as it began, everything changes. The lights flicker back to life, and the train lurches forward, picking up speed as it hurtles through the dark tunnel. The passengers around me exhale collectively, relief washing over their faces as the tension dissipates.

But I'm left with a lingering sense of unease, a feeling that something has shifted, that the darkness has left an indelible mark on me. As the train pulls into the next station, I feel a strange compulsion to get off, to escape the crowded car and the oppressive atmosphere. I push my way through the doors, stepping out into the bright lights of the platform, and take a deep breath of the cool, damp air.

As I look back at the train, now pulling away from the station, I realize that I'm no longer sure where I am or where I'm going. The dream is still unfolding, and I'm along for the ride, lost in a world of surreal landscapes and shifting realities.
