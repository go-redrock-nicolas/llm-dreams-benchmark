I am dreaming. You are transplanted into an alien world where the rules of society and communication are very different from what you're used to. You have to interact with others while obeying a complex set of protocols and etiquette that is not always clear or logical to you. Sometimes, you make mistakes and unintentionally offend someone or break a taboo. 

You find yourself in a situation where you accidentally say something that everyone around you finds extremely rude and offensive. They react with anger and hostility, and try to punish you for your transgression. You don't understand why they're upset, because you didn't mean any harm. You just spoke the truth as you see it. 

You wake up feeling confused and frustrated. You think about what happened in your dream and wonder if there is any meaning or lesson behind it. Maybe it was a metaphor for real life, where people get offended by things that are not really important, or where we sometimes have to obey rules that make no sense to us. Or maybe it was just a silly dream. What do you think?
