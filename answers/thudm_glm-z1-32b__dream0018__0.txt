I am dreaming. I am standing in the heart of a sprawling, labyrinthine mansion that seems to stretch endlessly into the night. The air is thick with the scent of aged mahogany and faded velvet, and the creaking of floorboards echoes like distant thunder. I wander through a grand foyer with vaulted ceilings, where crystal chandeliers cast prismatic patterns over Persian rugs. But something is wrong.

The walls are cracking with jagged lines that glow faintly, as if they're alive and moving. The floorboards heave upward in places, like the mansion is gasping for breath. I hear a low, rumbling groan that vibrates through my bones. As I turn the corner, I notice that the staircase is collapsing into a sinkhole of black, swirling sand. Dust motes float in slanted beams of moonlight, spinning like comets. The chandeliers sway perilously, their chains groaning under the strain.

In my pocket is a crumpled blueprint, disintegrating at the edges, with strange symbols that shift and blur when I look too closely. The ink writes itself in phrases like "Stability is an illusion" and "The house drinks time." My fingers brush the symbols, and they burn cold against my skin. 

I grab a splintering banister post to steady myself, but it splinters in my grip, creating a shard that jabs into my palm. Blood trickles down my wrist, and as it hits the floor, the sand underfoot swirls into a vortex. There's a whispered voice, ancient and crumbling: "You cannot fix what wants to be broken."
I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of aged mahogany and the sharp tang of sawdust, as if the very house is sweating. The mansion stretches before me like a fractal beast—its walls split open like the carapace of a dying turtle, revealing layers of skeleton wood and crumbling brick that hiss like steam. Moonlight pours through shattered windows, casting long, skeletal shadows that writhe like serpents on the floor. 

I clutch the blueprint, now a ghostly parchment that liquefies in my hands, its ink bleeding into the air as a chorus of whispers: *"You can’t outrun the cracks. They follow you home."* The staircase collapses into a pit of black sand, each grain a tiny, hungry eye that blinks in unison. I stumble backward, and the ceiling above me lifts like a petrified tongue, revealing the night sky. Stars spin overhead, their light fraying into static, as if the cosmos itself is unraveling. 

A door appears where none should be—a carved oak portal with handles shaped like clenched fists. When I push, it groans with a voice like splintering bone. Beyond it, I see myself, a tiny figure hammering at the cracks. But each blow rebounds, the hammer transforming into a dagger, and the cracks... they *laugh*. 

The walls begin to close in, their cracks knitting together into a vast, maw-like grin. I wake, my heartbeat echoing the final rumble of the house as it swallows itself whole, leaving only a pile of sand and a single, unbroken solar Flint in my shaking palm.
