I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself in a serene, misty forest clearing, the moon casting an ethereal glow upon the lush grass and towering ancient trees. The air is filled with the soothing chirps of crickets and the faint scent of lavender in the breeze. As I take in this tranquil scene, I notice a winding stone path leading deeper into the woods.

Curiosity compels me to follow the path. Soon, I come upon a quaint, inviting cabin nestled among the trees, its windows aglow with warm candlelight. A sign hangs above the door, reading: "Serenity Springs Therapeutic Retreat."

Opening the door, I step into a cozy living room, where a crackling fireplace casts warm shadows on the walls adorned with inspirational quotes and calming nature art. A group of strangers sits in a circle around the room, each holding a mug of steaming herbal tea. They turn to face me, smiles of understanding on their faces.

As I take a seat among them, I realize that these strangers share a profound connection with me - they have experienced the same trials and tribulations that have shaped my life.rennthea, who speaks softly, her voice trembling.  "My entire life has been a constant struggle. I never knew what it was like to feel truly happy.  I learned to keep my struggles hidden, a mask on my face every day to hide my pain.  But it was almost as if people could sense my pain, they called me weak.  But I feel so incredibly guilty for thinking about taking my own life on so many occasions.  I still do.  And I know that I am on the brink of a very dark time in my life again.  But this week, I am willing to try anything."

Renthea's words hang in the air, and I am stunned.  I am not here alone.  Each person here has been where I am right now.  I glance around.  I see Anger, who seems to be readying himself to talk.  He begins,

"I struggle with anger management.  Me and my family were not very close when I was young, we barely spoke to one another.  And I constantly felt like a mistake, a mistake that I had to make right and do everything right, or I would be a burden.  It was like I had to do everything facing 5 belts and my envy and feelings after someone else reached the top were my biggest motivators.  Everyone else, before me.  Not everything came naturally to me, and I had to make a point of getting better and better.  I feel like I am always competing, I'm competing against myself, and what drives me is my feeling of how terrible I am when I fuck up.  I don't want to fail.  Failing means that it is all over.  My dad said he was proud of me when I made the varsity basketball team in high school, but only if I kept working harder and harder.  I never felt good enough.  Even to this day I struggle thinking about my mistakes.  When I brush my teeth, I see mistakes.  Even when I come to talk to people like you about them.  I see an opportunity to brutally dissect my weaknesses to you.  And this, in turn, makes me angrier with myself."

"I know just what you mean, Anger...I go by Jim, no last name...I never wanted to talk to my son when I caught him drinking, but I knew I needed to."  The words spilled out of Jim, probably for the first time.  "I've let so many people down in my life.  I'm not a bad person, I just never knew the right way to cope with the feelings I was feeling: anger, fear, dread, etc...I just wanted to drink and move on, and not think about what happened when I got back.  And years went on and on.  I was a kind, caring, son.  A good husband.  Provided a good life.  Loved people who had no love for him.  And yet I watched myself throw it all away.  I would never have thought the day would come that my anger and alcoholism would put my son in the hospital and my wife in a dark place.  And all I could do was say, I am sorry when I could finally confront what I had done.  The difficult discussions were the ones I try to avoid, and the ones I didn't I landed in so much hurt.  I don't know how to talk to people anymore, we just avoid and avoid until there can be no avoid."

As Anger and Jim share these incredibly deep things, I see that yes, they are just like me on the inside.  I always feel broken, alone.  Hopeless, some days.  I don't know if I can talk, if I can do what is expected of me...and yet, I see that everyone is holding so many alcune things inside of them.  We are all part of the same dream.  I feel my voice begin to sound within me, for I am supposed to rise.  I am beginning to trust them, my road fellows, my cabal, my family.

It was my time.  I look around.  Fallsquil's ears perk up, he's about to begin. But I speak up, quietly, yet powerfully, speaking louder than I ever have: "I have felt so much fear, it is outlasted all hope and rationality.  It has consumed me, broken me.  I have had my heart ripped out so many times and I felt like I could never recover.  I lost faith in happiness and people, because I did not want to be disappointed again.  And that disappointment spread to such great darkness.  I wish so much I could live the day to day life, but so much of it feels like a cruel joke designed to make me feel like lesser, small, inadequate.  Always competing, but never winning.  Stuck.  So much of the time I feel so terribly alone, and it feels I can talk to people but...it feels like I can't say what I am truly thinking and feeling.  My mind has betrayed me over and over, but it all seemed to fit the pattern.  They have all wanted to break me down, my mind disclosing things to the people I have trusted, to break me down, to make me feel bad, like I am nothing.  Anger, Fallsquil, and many others feel it.  And I feel guilt for feeling it.  I need to lend a hand to others, and I should not feel what I am feeling . . . But it is how I feel, and I do..."

I spoke the truth, and they all nodded and smiled...smiled because I was there, in front of them...and not trying to do what I did every day, pretending it was all right and good...

I feel so grateful for the chance to be here, to be open with them, to begin to take the steps.  

The dream ends here...and I awake, feeling like a new person, and ready to take on the world again...to make amends, and improve my life.
