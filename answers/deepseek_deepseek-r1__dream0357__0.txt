I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a city made of light and smoke, where skyscrapers bleed into the stars and streets ripple like molten glass. The air hums with the whispers of a thousand unfinished conversations, each syllable dissolving before it reaches me. My breath crystallizes into sparrow-shaped fractals, fluttering briefly before shattering against my chest. I know, without knowing how I know, that this place is not a place at all—but a reckoning.  

A shadow looms behind me, ink-black and formless, undulating like oil beneath water. I run through alleyways that shift with each step; brick becomes bone becomes moss-slick stone. The shadow exhales cold that knots my veins. When I stumble, my palm hits a wall etched with names—names I recognize, names I’ve forgotten, names of ancestors who died before I was born. Their letters pulse faintly, glowing like bioluminescent worms.  

Suddenly, I’m in a cavernous library with no ceiling. Books float like autumn leaves, pages flapping in a wind that smells of burnt sage and hospital antiseptic. A skeletal figure in a moth-eaten cloak beckons. Its voice is static and storm: *“You’ve been borrowing time. All debts come due.”* In its hand, an hourglass drips not sand but fireflies, their tiny bodies flickering out as they hit the bottom.  

I wake in a meadow where the grass is translucent, roots threading into an abyss below. Starlight pierces my skin, and I feel my cells unraveling—a tapestry of dust and electricity. A stag with antlers of tangled telephone wires approaches. Its eyes are twin supernovae. *“You are the echo of a breath,”* it says, *“the pause between thunder and lightning.”*  

Then, a flood. A tsunami of crimson water swallows the horizon. Among the waves, faces surge—faces of strangers, lovers, a younger version of myself gasping for air. I dive in. Time fractures. My lungs fill with liquid that tastes like copper and childhood birthdays. When I breach the surface, the sky is a quilt of scars. A child on the shore hands me a paper boat. As I set it adrift, it blooms into a lotus, petals peeling back to reveal a single, pulsing nebula.  

I awaken—or do I?—in my bed. The walls breathe. My heartbeat syncs with the drip of a faucet I don’t own. A moth taps Morse code on the window. For a moment, I forget the shape of my name. The dream lingers, coiled in my marrow like fog.
