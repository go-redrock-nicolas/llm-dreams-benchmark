I am dreaming. I am about to perform brain surgery despite having no medical training.  The patient's life depends entirely on my untested abilities, and as I hold the scalpel, I feel a rush of adrenaline and fear.
The operating room is silent except for the sound of my breathing and the beeping of machines.  The lights are bright and harsh, illuminating the white tiles and stainless steel instruments.  The patient lies still on the table, naked and exposed, connected to wires and tubes.  I can see her face clearly through the mask, and I wonder if she is aware of what is happening.
I take a deep breath and make the first cut.  The skin resists for a moment before yielding to my blade.  I expose the pink flesh beneath, and I marvel at its texture and structure.  I insert the forceps and begin to manipulate the tissue, trying to locate the target area.
I feel a sense of euphoria as I control this delicate yet powerful machine that is my body.  I imagine what my parents would say if they could see me now, performing such a feat of engineering and intelligence.  I smile to myself, imagining their pride and surprise.
I hear a voice behind me, whispering in my ear.
"Are you sure about this?  Is this really what you want?"
I pause for a moment, considering the question.  Then I continue my work, ignoring the voice and its doubts.
As I approach the end of my task, I feel a sense of urgency and anticipation.  I know that soon I will reveal the secret that has been hidden inside the patient's head for so long.  Soon I will free her from her prison and let her spirit soar.
I make the final incision, and I see something glittering at the bottom of the cavity.  I reach in with my hand and grab it, feeling its weight and shape.  I pull it out and hold it up for everyone to see.
It is a diamond, large and perfect, with facets that reflect the light in all directions.  It is a symbol of beauty and purity and hope.
I look at the patient's face again, and this time I see her eyes open slightly.  I lean down and whisper into her ear.
"Welcome back to life."

I wake up from my dream feeling excited and curious.  What do you think about what I did?  Do you agree that it was a good thing for me to do?
