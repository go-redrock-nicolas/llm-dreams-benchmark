I am dreaming. The metallic walls of the elevator close in around me as crystal clear water rushes in from tiny fissures at the bottom. With mounting dread, I watch the glassy liquid climb higher, its surface reflecting the harsh emergency lights like dozens of tiny mirrors. Oxygen feels scarce as I drink in shallow, panicked breaths.

Cobwebs of current caress my skin, the water growing colder as it rises. My shoes squelch wetly when I shift my footing, and I can feel the water seeping into each stitch of my clothes. The moment the liquid touches my feet, a violent jolt courses through me. My muscles tense as I rise to my toes, desperation making my breath come even faster now. The water laps ever higher against my shins.

The elevator's control panel beeps pathetically as I frantically press buttons, my fingers becoming pruney from the growing pool at my feet. The doors won't budge, the water already waist deep and climbing steadily higher. I press my palms against the ceiling, feeling for any trace of movement, any sign that rescue is possible. But it's dead still. Alarm bells ring as water meets the tops of the arrows marking floor numbers.

Panic overwhelms me. I splash through the water, yanking at the door handles with my full body weight. The freezing liquid is at chest level now, each breath a battle against the rising tide and suffocating fear in my chest. My lunges grow more desperate as the water continues its inexorable climb. I'm going to drown in this confined space.

Just as the water reaches my face, I jolt awake. My heart is pounding, sheets damp with sweat, a gasp catching in my throat. It was just a nightmare. But the vivid memory of that terrifying underwater panic hangs in the air, and my breath doesn't return to normal for a long time.
