I am dreaming. The first thing I notice is that the air shimmers. It's not ordinary air—it’s sapphire and gold, rippling like an ocean without waves. I'm standing on a path paved with what looks like crushed starlight, each pebble humming with forgotten melodies. The trees around me are iridescent, their leaves shaped like tiny, translucent wings that beat rhythmically as if trying to take flight. 

A voice, neither male nor female, speaks directly into my thoughts: *"Find the Heart of the Everless Clock before the ninth chime echoes."* There’s a clock tower in the distance, its spire twisting upward into a lavender sky. But as I start to walk, the ground shifts. The starlight path dissolves into aFloor of Liquid Obsidian. It’s viscous and black, reflecting not my image but scenes from futures I don’t recognize—successes and failures flicker on its surface like dying stars. 

I try to run, but the obsidian suction is too strong. Every step pulls my ankles deeper, and the reflections grow more frantic. The clock tower now has seven faces, each showing a different time. The chimes begin to ring discordant notes. My initial plan—to charge straight—is failing. 

Then I notice something glinting in the obsidian. A key, its teeth made of liquid light. I reach down; it pulls free as soon as my fingers touch it. The voice whispers: *“The pivot isn’t to fight the flow, but to become the current itself.”* 

A strange sensation overtakes me. My body grows lighter, my edges as fluid as mercury. The obsidian floor stops resisting; I glide across the surface, now seeing each reflection as a thread of probability. The key levitates, and understanding clicks: I must *steer* through the futures, not trample them. 

I direct the key toward the nearest reflection showing the clocktower’s ninth chime moments before impact. Time bends. The clocktower’s faces flicker, and I’m pulled into that thread—a corridor of pinwheeling gears and reversed rain. There, embedded in the tower’s core, pulses a orb the size of a fist: the Heart of the Everless Clock. It’s alive, singing in harmonies older than sorrow. 

As I grasp it, the world fractures. The dream becomes a mosaic, each shard a possible reality. The voice murmurs gratitude, then dissolves. I wake with the faintest hum in my palm, and daylight spills in, ordinary and extraordinary all at once.
