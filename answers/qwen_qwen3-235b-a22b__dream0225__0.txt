I am dreaming. You’re standing in a library that shouldn’t exist. Its shelves spiral into a sky smeared with auroras, and the books hum like living things. A librarian with a face made of shifting constellations hands you a scroll sealed in wax that evaporates at your touch. The text glows: *“You have been chosen to rebuild the Clockwork Labyrinth of the Vanished Gods. Your tools: a compass forged from a star’s core, a spool of thread spun from forgotten memories, and a vial of ink that bleeds into reality. The other candidates have declined. Or perhaps they dissolved. Details are… fluid.”*  

You step through a door that wasn’t there a moment ago. The labyrinth awaits—a sprawling maze of gears the size of mountains, its corridors paved with teeth and moonlight. The walls breathe. Sometimes they whisper in the language of black holes; other times, they sing lullabies in your mother’s voice, though you never told anyone what her voice sounded like. The other competitors are specters with PhDs in paradox, engineers of the impossible, poets who can bend gravity with a sonnet. They materialize, solve puzzles etched into the walls (equations that morph into dragons, riddles that unravel into constellations), and vanish like smoke. You trail behind, clutching your thread and ink, certain you’ll unravel into a footnote.  

But then—a shift. The labyrinth *notices* you. A gear grinds to a halt when you press your palm to it. A river of liquid starlight parts, revealing a path, when you hum a nursery rhyme off-key. The thread, you realize, isn’t for stitching wounds or maps. It’s for weaving connections the gods forgot: a synapse between the labyrinth’s fractured logic and your stubborn, messy humanity. You start tying knots in the air, each one a bridge between *sense* and *feeling*. A bridge that weeps. A bridge that laughs. A bridge that tastes like burnt toast and nostalgia.  

The final chamber is a room with no walls. Just a clock with no hands, and a mirror that reflects not your face, but a thousand versions of yourself—some heroic, some monstrous, all flickering like film. The labyrinth’s voice booms, not in words but in the ache of a violin string: *“Choose. One thread. One truth. One lie. One memory to unmake yourself.”*  

You hesitate, then dip your fingers into the ink. You paint a door on the mirror, a door that leads nowhere and everywhere. When it opens, the labyrinth shudders, not in anger, but relief. The gods, it seems, didn’t vanish. They were waiting for someone to *imagine* them back into existence.  

You wake up with the taste of stardust on your tongue and a thread tangled in your hair. The dream clings, not as a memory, but as a scar—and a compass needle trembling north, always north, toward the next impossible thing.
