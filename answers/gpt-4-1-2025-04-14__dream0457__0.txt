I am dreaming.

It is late dusk in a city built from shifting shadows and molten silver, where the architecture ripples like satin in a gentle breeze. The skyscrapers lean close together, sharing secrets in a language of light and darkness. I drift, weightless, down avenues paved with stardust, and every footstep rings out a soft, resonant chord.

But tonight, something has changed. I sense my capacity for self-compassion dwindling, slipping through my fingers like smoke just when the sky grows heavy and oppressive. The city’s reflections twist into darker mirages, and the music of my progress falters. A chill presses in—a familiar tightening, a hush that swallows up warmth and ease.

That’s when, somewhere in the labyrinth of glass, a door appears—arched, blue, pulsing softly. I step through and find myself in a boundless garden under a velvet, indigo sky. Flowers the color of longing and comfort bloom as far as I can see. Their fragrances swirl: rose and sandalwood, rain and forgiveness.

Here, the deepest parts of my imagination assemble to teach me kindness. Voices rise out of the petals, gentle and true, spinning stories of past hurts and small victories. Some belong to friends, some to strangers, others to myself as a child, catching fireflies. They murmur: “In your weakest moments, be for yourself what you would be for those you love—a refuge, not a judge.”

I kneel in the soft earth and plant my worries beside a luminous lotus. My failures crack open and roots tangle upward—alive, beckoning. “Cultivate patience,” the trees whisper, “tend to your bruised places as gardens in need of light and water, not scorn.”

A river runs nearby, gleaming with memories. I reach in—cool and clean. Each droplet clings to me, beading on my skin. With every step, I gather the shimmering fragments of lost self-compassion, piecing them together in my heart like stained glass.

From above, the moon leans down and wraps me in a silk shawl woven from hope. “Carry this home,” she sighs. “Remember, you are deserving—especially when you forget it most.”

In this dream, as the garden merges with morning, I awaken with the petals’ voices lingering: Forgive. Begin again. Bring gentleness to the places that hurt, and new blooms will rise—soft, wild, and resilient—whenever you wander back into the dark.
