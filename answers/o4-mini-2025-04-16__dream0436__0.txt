I am dreaming. You tumble through a shifting sky of lavender clouds, each wisp glowing like lantern smoke. Below you, a forest of silver-frosted pines hums under moonlight: branches pulse with every heartbeat, as if the woods itself were listening. In your hand, you clutch a small, carved wooden box—it vibrates with a secret you’ve carried for years. 

As you open the lid, a misty projection floats upward: images of every time you held back in friendship or love, afraid that revealing your true self would scare someone away. You watch yourself at a crowded table, nodding along when you yearned to speak your mind; you see a hand extending toward you that you never took, because you feared you’d ask too much. The mist condenses into a crystalline figure—a tall, graceful mirror in human form—who whispers, “You believe that asking for what you need will push others away. That belief is your cage.”

At once, the forest around you shivers. The silver needles rain down and, as they touch your skin, you feel the weight of that old assumption dissolve into motes of light. With a single exhalation, you challenge the mirror’s words: “But what if connection grows from honesty, not from perfection?” The mirrored face softens; its fractured surface heals into a smooth, radiant glow. You realize the box in your hand has transformed into a delicate lantern, its flame flickering with warmth instead of fear.

In the next breath, the trees part to reveal an open glade bathed in the dawn colors of violet and rose. Along its edge, figures—friends you’ve lost touch with, a potential lover, even a stranger whose eyes are familiar—stand waiting. The air itself tastes of promise. You step forward without hesitation, offering your lantern to the nearest figure. They accept it, and as the light leaps between you, you feel something new: the gentle thrill of being fully seen and still welcomed.

Challenging that long-held belief, you find your voice unguarded and curious. Each step you take in the glade strengthens vines of glowing flowers that entwine you with those around you—proof that authentic connection blossoms when you dare to let your true self be known. Then the dream ripples like a pebble dropped into water, and you awaken with your heart ringing in harmony, carrying that lantern of honesty into your waking life.
