I am dreaming. My hands tremble as I stand behind the heavy velvet curtain, its deep crimson folds brushing against my skin like whispers of doubt. The masterpiece I've spent years creating - a sprawling canvas that seems to pulse with its own heartbeat - waits just beyond, about to be revealed to the glittering crowd of art critics and collectors who murmur in the gallery beyond.

But something is terribly wrong. As I peek through a gap in the curtain, my blood runs cold. The painting, which just hours ago was perfect, has begun to transform before my eyes. The carefully crafted faces of my subjects are melting like wax, their features sliding down the canvas in grotesque rivulets of oil paint. The meticulously planned composition is unraveling - quite literally - as threads of color begin to lift from the surface and float away like wayward spider silk.

I can hear the gallery director announcing my name, her voice echoing through the space like thunder. The audience applauds, their expectations hanging heavy in the air. But they can't see what I see - how the trees in my landscape are now growing backwards into the ground, how the sky has begun to crack like ancient pottery, revealing a void of impossible darkness behind it.

I try to call out, to stop the unveiling, but my voice has transformed into a shower of butterflies that scatter from my mouth and dissolve into motes of dust. My feet feel rooted to the floor, which has become soft and spongey like moss. The curtain begins to rise of its own accord, and I watch in horror as my masterpiece continues its supernatural deterioration, knowing that I alone can perceive its descent into chaos.

The audience leans forward in anticipation, their faces suddenly elongating, their eyes growing wider and wider until they resemble full moons floating in a sea of expectant faces...
