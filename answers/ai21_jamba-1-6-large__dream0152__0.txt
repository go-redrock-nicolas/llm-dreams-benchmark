I am dreaming. I find myself amid a mystical courtroom, one where the walls shimmer with a golden light and are adorned with tapestries of ancient glyphs. Each tapestry, pulsing faintly as though alive, tells a story of forgotten laws and anomalies. 

Before me sits a triangular table, with dim-lit candles floating in the air. At each corner of the table, there is a witness, and their faces reflect a galaxy of mysteries. Two of them seem human, yet their eyes betray something far older and more enigmatic. The third being is cloaked entirely in shifting shadows that ripple like liquid darkness. 

I stand in the center, wearing a dark charcoal cloak lined with silver threads. As I move, the fabric shifts, here and there, reflecting starlight. I'm not entirely sure how I came to occupy this role, but I sense an agreement, an understanding that I must be the one to settle this dispute. 

The two opposing sides are expected to present their cases as cogently and ethically as possible. The first to speak is a tall figure in robes of shimmering blue. His voice resonates through the air like distant thunder, echoing through the chamber. 

"Arbiter," he begins, "The essence of our world is unraveling. The denizens of the Shadowlands know only what they are born into, the nature of their void, but little do they know of the boundless realms that exist beyond. My light is a beacon of hope, the protector of the hinterlands. It must be so." 

As he speaks, I sense the profound burden behind his words. His voice speaks of endless vigilance, an eternal fire that he carries alone. 

The second witness steps forward. She is draped in robes of deepest indigo, and her presence radiates a quiet calm. "Do not be fooled, Arbiter," she says with soft authority. "It is not the Shadowlands that need to be contained or revealed. It is the very essence of light itself that must be checked. For too long, light has dictated what is seen and unseen. What is life if not an ever-moving tapestry of shades and shadows? Denizens of Shadowlands have wisdom that the light cannot perceive."

The third figure, cloaked in shadow, remains still. His silence is heavy, almost suffocating. It is in this silence that the arbitration begins. 

As I listen to each side, their arguments embedding themselves into my mind, I feel the weight of the decision pressing down on me, threatening to capsize me. To make a choice is to alter not just this courtroom, but to decide the fate of realms unknown. 

Finally, I speak. 

"I have listened to both perspectives," I say, "I acknowledge the profound weight both sides carry. You both seek to protect that which you love most—freedom, understanding, life in its many forms. But the issue is not which choice is right or wrong, for all life depends on the balance between light and shadow."

I lower my voice, holding the silence. 

"If I had the ability to make the choice for the ages, I would choose neither. I would protect instead the choice to let the light dance with the shadow." 

They all look up, uncertain. 

"Shadowlands must remain, and the light must cast shadows, not in fear, but in understanding that the interplay is vital for life’s fabric. The great cycle is not one of dominance, but of balance." 

With this, the room shifts to a soft, warm glow, with the interplay of both light and shadow, both dark and bright. The shadows begin to shift, shifting in harmony with the light, fading here, brightening there, and both figures begin sabemos somos . They understand. 

The androgynous figure in the robes of blue, the cloaked woman, and the figure in shadows, with their gazes upon me, smile in an expression of serene understanding. 

Existence is balance. Shadow. Light. It is not from one that we can fully grasp the other. 

In the dream's final moments, as I stand in the midst of their reconciled joy, I realize something profound about myself. Within me is a similar conflict, light and shadow, that I too must learn to coexist with. 

And as the dream fades, I take this truth with me.
