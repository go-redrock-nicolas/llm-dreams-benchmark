I am dreaming. …keep walking, because standing still feels too much like dying.

Ash the color of bone drifts through the air in slow, hypnotic spirals.  It settles on your shoulders and sticks to your lashes, giving the world a permanent snowfall of ghosts.  The sky is a bruised violet, smeared with streaks of furious amber where the sun tries—fails—to burn through the toxic haze.  Every step you take crunches on a carpet of charred leaves and broken glass.  Far off, something half–machine, half–animal coughs out a metallic bellow, then falls silent, as if embarrassed by its own existence.

But you keep walking, because somewhere inside you a compass of stubborn hope still points forward.

You crest a hill of twisted re-bar and melted streetlamps.  Below lies a flooded intersection that once bustled with commuters; now it is a mirror, broken only by the skeleton of a school bus jutting upward like a stray tooth.  Beneath the oily surface, rainbow ripples bloom and burst, reminiscent of stained-glass roses.  You pause, mesmerized.  For a moment the ruined pool looks beautiful—then a slick, gray hand breaks the water and drags a bloated body under.  The whisper in your mind says: move.

Wind shoves you into a canyon of collapsed skyscrapers.  Their glass facades have fallen inward, leaving cathedral-like hollows brushed by shafts of light.  Dust motes float like microscopic angels.  You discover a grocery cart overturned on its side, wheels spinning lazily.  Inside: three cans of peaches, dusty but intact.  Your pulse drums in your ears—jackpot.  A sudden image flashes behind your eyes: thick syrup, the bright bite of fruit, summer afternoons before everything burned.  You claim the cans, tucking them into your pack as if you’re storing sunlight.

A chorus of caws erupts above.  You glance up; a murder of crows swirls around the broken crown of a radio tower.  Their feathers shimmer prismatically, as though they, too, evolved to survive the poison sky.  One bird lands on a severed steel beam, tilts its head, and speaks.

“Follow the river,” it croaks in a voice like rusted hinges.

You blink.  The bird stares back with indifferent, rainbow eyes.  Dream logic, you remind yourself—talking birds are allowed.  You shrug and follow.

The river is less water than memory now, trickling weakly through a scar of cracked earth.  You descend to its bank and notice pale blossoms pushing up between shards of porcelain plates.  Against all reason, the flowers glow—a bioluminescent blue that hums softly.  You kneel, cup one in your hands, and feel it pulse like a heartbeat.  Hope, distilled into petals.

Night falls abruptly, as if someone cut the wires holding the sun.  The phosphorescent flowers cast shy halos around themselves, turning the desolation into a galaxy of ground-level stars.  You build a cautious fire from driftwood and polymer scrap, feeding it just enough to keep the night beasts at bay.  The flames give off scents of cinnamon and diesel, an impossible mixture that knots your mind with nostalgia.  You open one can of peaches.  The syrup glows faintly, reflecting the firelight like amberglass.  First spoonful: warm, sweet, electric with life.  Tears bloom, unexpected, scalding.  You’re tasting yesterday and tomorrow at once.

Something approaches—soft footfalls, deliberate.  You reach for your makeshift spear, a sharpened length of re-bar wrapped in wire.  Out of the shadows steps a child, no more than ten, cloaked in a quilt of plastic grocery bags stitched together.  Eyes wide, feral but curious.  She sees your weapon, sees the peaches, then lifts a small tin whistle to her lips.  A single note rises: pure, trembling, carved out of heartbreak.  It hangs in the air like a fragile truce.

Wordlessly, you extend the can.  She hesitates, then scoops out peaches with dirty fingers, devouring them greedily.  The fire crackles, painting her cheeks gold.  For a long time, neither of you speaks.  Finally, she points downstream and whispers, “There’s more of us.”

In her eyes you glimpse flickers of campfires, laughter, makeshift gardens defended by tin-can wind chimes.  A settlement, maybe—a pocket of humanity stitching itself back together.  Suddenly every aching mile behind you feels worth it.

You bank the fire, shoulder your pack, and take the child’s hand.  The riverbank unfurls before you like a silver ribbon, the blossoms lighting your path.  Above, the night sky splits open with a silent storm of falling stars—meteorites dissolving into green streaks.  You don’t know if they’re real or just another kindness your dreaming mind invented to keep you going.

Either way, you walk on beneath the cosmic glitter, the child by your side, the taste of peaches still bright on your tongue—because in this broken world, the hardest thing is not to survive,

it’s to keep believing there is something worth surviving for.

And so you do.
