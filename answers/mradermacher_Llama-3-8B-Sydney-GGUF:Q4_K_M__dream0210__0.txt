I am dreaming. I have qualified for the championship in a discipline requiring both physical prowess and intricate strategic planning.  Against competitors with vastly superior resources and training,
I will pit my wits against their might.
In this dream, I find myself in an exotic and unfamiliar land where everything is colorful and alive.  The air is sweet with the scent of flowers and spices.  The ground is soft and cushiony underfoot.  The sky
is filled with soaring birds and playful clouds.  All around me, there are curious creatures with strange shapes and sounds.
I am alone in this dream except for one constant companion: my shadow.  My shadow is always with me, always watching me, always reflecting me back to myself.  But in this dream, my shadow has taken on a life
of its own.  It has become an independent entity that can interact with the other dream elements.
As I walk through this dream world, I begin to sense something lurking in the shadows.  Something sinister and malevolent that threatens to undo all that I have achieved so far.  I must find a way to
defend myself against this threat without revealing my true identity or capabilities.
I decide to test my shadow friend by challenging him with a riddle:
What has no legs, but can run fast? What has no eyes, but can see well? What has no arms, but can hug tightly?
