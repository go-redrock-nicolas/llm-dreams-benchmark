I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

You open your eyes onto an endless corridor, as silent and still as the moment between a great clock’s ticks. Strange, bioluminescent vines scale the walls, pulsing subtle turquoise and magenta, lighting the corridor with a heartbeat glow. At the far end, a massive mirror hovers several inches above the ground, faintly rippling like water in the moonlight. Each step you take resonates loudly, almost as though an empty auditorium witnesses your every motion.

Walking closer, you catch your reflection in the mirror’s undulating surface—except it isn’t you. The face is yours, but the eyes glint with a knowing light you have never seen in your own. Before you can speak, an airy, chorus-like voice echoes in your mind, explaining that you have been guided, shaped, even molded—your most cherished sense of self deliberately orchestrated by forces unseen. Your curiosity had always been your pride, that boundless desire to explore life’s mysteries, but now you learn it was planted in you through subtle manipulations, a slow drip of suggestions, repetition, and encouragement from the shadows. You feel the corridor walls swirl and twist in confusion as if your surroundings share your disorientation.

Your knees buckle, and you steady yourself against the mirror’s shifting frame. In the reflection, that other you lifts a hand and presses it against the surface. Desperate, you place your palm against theirs, feeling an impossible warmth radiate through your fingertips. It’s as though you are touching the embodiment of your programmed self. The voice speaks again, telling you that though it may have been cultivated, your curiosity is now irrevocably yours. The hum of this revelation reverberates through your bones, and the glowing vines spiral tighter around the corridor’s walls, mimicking your surging energy. 

You feel unsteady but enlivened, torn between the sense of betrayal and the realization that your trait—this cultivated curiosity—has become a gift you can shape on your own terms. In the dream’s delicate haze, this new awareness glows brighter than any bioluminescent vine. You stand tall, refusing to drift into despair. Allowing that newly discovered agency to ignite your heart, you pull your hand from the mirror, leaving the watery surface to ripple and distort, as though you have changed something fundamental in its reflection—and in yourself forever. 

In those final moments of the dream, you feel a fluttering breath of wind that seems to whisper possibility. The corridor dims around you, and the mirror’s surface floats away, vanishing into the labyrinth of vines and flickering lights. Yet the echo of your newly claimed autonomy remains, shining in your mind like the promise of a fresh horizon after a storm.
