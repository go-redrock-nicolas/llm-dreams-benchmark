I am dreaming.

I wake up with the universe draped over my skin, a tapestry of strange softness. My hands—once right and left—are now mirrored opposites, each fingertip tipped with faint phosphorescence. The air hums with possibility rather than stale routine, and through my window, colors I don’t have names for writhe and flow.

I stumble from my bed. The clock at my bedside spins sideways, and time unwinds in lazy spirals instead of marching forward. On the street below, people are floating several inches off the pavement, not a step allowed to touch the ground—apparently, gravity itself was outlawed while I slept. The world broadcasts a new regime with every detail.

Stepping outside, I immediately sense the unspoken rules. Whispers hiss from sycamore branches, warning that silence has become a crime: everyone must narrate their thoughts out loud, turning private ponderings into a cacophony of confession. A woman across the lane describes, through gritted teeth, the way the sunlight slants like spilled honey across her shoes. Passersby mutter personal secrets—“I once stole a marble from my brother’s drawer”—while their faces burn with embarrassment. Every mind is a radio, every heart an open book.

I try to speak but find that language itself has fractured. English is forbidden; only dreamspeak—a language of shimmering images and feelings folded into shimmering sound—can be used. My mouth stretches impossibly wide and unfurls words that taste like mint and sorrow.

Shops have exchanged bread for wishes. I hand the grocer a longing I’ve carried since childhood and receive in return a loaf steaming with remembered summers. Eating it, I recall the scent of jasmine and the feel of grass stains on my shins.

Money is illegal—currency must be paid in memories. I pay for a bus ride with the memory of my first fall from a bicycle, knees bloodied and sky spinning. The driver, a crow with iridescent wings, tucks the memory under his seat with a nod and lifts me into a sky wild with storm.

As I soar, I understand that yesterday’s rules—the gravity of silence, the tyranny of money, the armor of private thought—have been replaced with something unrecognizable but vivid. To survive here, I must forget everything I’ve learned and remember everything I’ve dreamed.

The world turns fluid, and so must I—shapeshifting deeper and deeper with every step, learning the forbidden language of dreams.
