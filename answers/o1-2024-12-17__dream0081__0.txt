I am dreaming. …are suddenly caught in a whirlwind of frantic whispers, swirling dust, and pounding footsteps echoing off ancient city walls. The once-lively bazaar crams shut its steaming food stalls, the vendors’ eyes wide with fear as they scramble to pull heavy iron gates down. I notice what looks like a parade of uniformed officers marching down the main street. In one direction, wrought-iron gates are slammed closed; in another, makeshift barricades of stacked crates appear from nowhere, like mushrooms shooting up after a storm. 

It all happens in the blink of an eye. Only moments ago, the sunlight bounced playfully off warm gold-hued buildings. The air was sweet with cardamom and saffron, spiced with offerings from the street kitchens, layered with the lilting strings of a local violin—and now, all of that dissolves into hushed panic and tension. A gust of wind whips by, stirring up the grit underfoot. The shutters of upper windows are slapped shut from within, as if each home on the street has retreated into its own shell.

I find my heart bellowing at the cage of my chest, each beat sharper than the last. I scramble to ask the nearest passerby what's happening, but their eyes are only filled with alarm. They flee before a word leaves my lips. The hush that’s settled is eerie, the vacuum of it louder than the roaring crowd that once was. News crackles from a handheld radio someone dropped onto the pavement—words of military intervention, restricted movement, closed borders. The panic in the reporter’s voice is palpable, and I swear I can taste the metallic tang of my own fear. My mind reels. Borders are closed. No exit. No escape.

I decide to latch onto the only option I have: keep moving. Navigating a maze of back alleys and twisted corridors, I try to outrun the creeping sense of doom. The roads narrow until they feel like tunneling roots pushing into the earth, and the dimness grows more oppressive with each step. I can’t shake the feeling that at any moment, soldiers will lock these side streets off too, trapping me. My heart hammers a thousand beats a second, the pace of my footsteps picking up as I break into a run, echoing with the patter of distant gunfire in the not-so-far distance. 

I sprint until I reach a deserted piazza—cobblestones slick with recent rain, the air charged with electricity. The sky is an angry shade of plum, punctuated by lightning that illuminates the spires of crumbling towers around me. A single streetlamp flickers overhead, casting a pale orange glow. Its shimmering light reveals a fleeting glimpse of my reflection in a puddle. My own face looks foreign, eyes wide in terror, lips cracked from the dryness of my quickened breathing. In the reflection, I see movement behind me—a scattering shape in the shadows.

I turn, expecting to see a patrol or an official, but instead, out steps a wiry old man in flowing robes, his skin weathered from sun and time. He approaches me, as ghostly as a breeze, expression unreadable, until he presses a small wooden token into my hand. Marked by an intricate carving—two winged creatures intertwined—it feels warm to the touch, alive with a quiet hum. He leans in, whispers in a language I can’t understand, and disappears out of the flickering light. 

Despite being alone again, I feel a sliver of hope stirring. The city around me, once so menacing, now throbs with mysterious possibility. I sense that somewhere in these alleys lies a secret passage or a quiet route that can slip me beyond the barricades. The token pulses between my fingers, guiding me like a living compass. I follow the faint vibration deeper into the labyrinthian heart of the city. Walls seem to move and rearrange themselves in the corners of my vision, archways extend or shrink as if the architecture itself is alive. 

Eventually, I reach a broken gate, half-hidden by overgrown vines and moldering tapestries. The token quivers, and I press it against the rusted lock. It clicks open, revealing a narrow corridor bathed in dim torchlight. Each step I take reverberates with a foreboding echo. The corridor’s ceiling arches overhead like the rib cage of a sleeping beast, tricky and ominous, but it also feels like a path of destiny. 

At the end of the passage, I emerge onto a clearing outside the city’s towering walls. There, under swaying lanterns and a sky splattered with purple clouds, I see a swirl of gray smoke drifting from the horizon, as if the world on the other side is also trembling. The moon, pale and trembling itself, seems to beckon me forward. A pang of sadness strikes me—this country was enchanting just hours ago, offering flavors and music and culture I had barely begun to explore. Now, it feels like a realm suspended on the brink of collapse. 

And yet the sense of possibility remains. I hold up the token one last time, letting it catch the moon’s gleam. The soft hum it gives off grows stronger, as though promising me safe passage if I trust in something greater than my own fear. I take a steadying breath, steeling myself for whatever new frontier lies beyond this broken border. The next step feels like walking off a ledge into unknown skies. 

Suddenly, a gust of wind tears through me, and I’m awash in both heat and cold. The weight of the dream intensifies, pressing on all sides, as if the walls of reality bend around me. My heart thrums in my ears. Shadows dance in the corners of my vision, replaced by a sudden dazzling light. With a jolt, everything shifts, and I realize… I’m either about to wake up or tumble deeper into this surreal adventure, forever changed by the strange token’s power and the wild, unpredictable spirit of this dreamland.
