I am dreaming. Step into this somnolent world with me.

I am standing on the edge of a quiet, silver lake shrouded in dusk, the water’s surface perfectly still except for the ripples my bare toes draw in the cool sand. The sky overhead simmers with opalescent clouds—lavender, gold, the pale green of memory itself—echoing across the water. Around me, enormous trees loom out of the mist, their branches festooned with tiny, glowing paper lanterns that flicker in an unfelt wind. Each light pulses with a warmth that is somehow familiar, like the remembered laughter of childhood friends or the bittersweet pang of an old tune on the radio.

But under all this beauty, there is an ache—an elusive moment I must reclaim. All at once, voices drift across the lake, whispering snatches of recollection:  
“Don’t you remember the way the moon turned red that night?”  
“You promised you would never forget what she said…”

I wade deeper into the water, my legs brushing cold stems of dream-lilies, petals black as ink. The lakebed gives way beneath me, and I sink, slow-swimming through ink and light. As I descend, images bloom around me: a crumbling staircase spiraling into endless dark; a locked wooden box that hums with urgency; pages from my own diary written in a language I can almost understand.

Strangers and loved ones drift by, their faces turning toward me, each offering a version of the event I am seeking. Their voices overlap, a babble of certainty and contradiction. An old friend’s hand presses mine; their grip is warm, insistent.  
**“It happened with the rain,”** they allege.  
But then another presence—eerily familiar—shakes their head:  
**“No, it was the fire, remember? The night you couldn’t bear to watch…”**

I attempt to shout the truth I feel—flashing, half-forgotten—but my voice comes out as a spray of silver fish, darting away into the dark. A great key, baroque and golden, rotates above me, just out of reach. My fingertips graze it, desperate, while below, the mysterious box thrums more loudly.

At the last moment, clarity begins to crystallize. The true memory surges up—the taste of rain and smoke, the timbre of a promise made and broken, my own trembling resolve. But in this world of shifting truths, as the box finally unlocks and bright white light spills out, the memory dissolves like mist in the sunrise.

I wake, heart pounding, certain I once knew what really happened, certain too that the crucial detail has eluded me once again, submerged somewhere beneath the silver lake of dreams.
