I am dreaming. During a heated debate, someone deliberately provokes me with a personal insult designed to make me lose control. In that charged moment, I feel a searing heat rise within me, a volcanic pressure building behind my eyes. The room, once a staid conference hall bathed in the sterile glow of fluorescent lights, begins to warp and shimmer like a mirage on sun-baked asphalt. The polished mahogany table stretches impossibly long, its surface reflecting distorted, sneering faces that swim in and out of focus. The air crackles with an unseen energy, thick and heavy like the atmosphere before a thunderstorm.

My adversary's words, sharp and barbed, echo in the suddenly cavernous space, reverberating not just in my ears but deep within my bones. They are poison-tipped arrows seeking the softest parts of my composure. I can feel the familiar, fiery surge of anger clawing its way up my throat, threatening to erupt in a torrent of retaliatory venom. My knuckles are white where they grip the armrests of my chair, the faux leather groaning under the strain. A tremor starts in my hands, a physical manifestation of the storm raging inside.

But then, something shifts. Instead of the expected explosion, a peculiar calm descends upon me, cool and silvery like moonlight on water. It's not detachment, but a profound, almost otherworldly awareness. The insult, once a burning brand, now feels distant, like a shout heard from across a vast canyon. I see the provoker leaning forward, their face contorted in a mask of malicious glee, waiting for the inevitable breakdown, the satisfying shatter of my control.

In that charged moment, instead of lashing out, I find myself… floating. Gently, inexplicably, I rise a few inches above my chair. The sensation is not one of levitation by force, but of being lifted by an invisible current, lighter than air. The anger hasn't vanished, but it has transformed. It's no longer a consuming fire, but a concentrated point of light, warm and contained, hovering in my chest.

From this slightly elevated perspective, the scene takes on a surreal quality. The distorted faces around the table become less menacing, more like caricatures sketched by a mischievous artist. The tension in the room remains palpable, but it flows around me, unable to penetrate the bubble of serene stillness I now inhabit.

I meet my provoker’s gaze, not with fury, but with an unsettlingly placid smile. It’s a smile that doesn’t quite reach my eyes, which hold the ancient calm of a deep forest pool. I don't speak. The silence stretches, thick and expectant, confounding their expectations. My lack of reaction seems to infuriate them more than any shouted retort ever could. Their face flushes a deeper shade of puce, their own control beginning to fray at the edges.

Slowly, deliberately, I raise a hand – not in aggression, but in a gesture akin to a conductor calming an orchestra. As I do, the harsh fluorescent lights soften, replaced by a warm, golden luminescence that seems to emanate from an unseen source. The air loses its oppressive weight, filled instead with the faint, melodic hum of crystalline chimes. The polished table beneath me begins to ripple, its reflection showing not distorted faces, but a tranquil sky filled with slow-moving, pastel clouds.

The insult hangs in the air, rendered impotent, a discarded weapon lying useless on the floor. The power dynamic has irrevocably shifted. My stillness, my unexpected ascent, my quiet refusal to engage on their terms – it has stolen their victory, leaving them sputtering in a pool of their own spent malice. The volcanic pressure inside me has not erupted destructively outwards, but has instead forged something new within: a core of unshakeable, luminous calm. I continue to float, suspended in the golden light, observing the remnants of the confrontation dissolve like smoke, aware that in the bizarre logic of this dream, I have won not by fighting back, but by rising above.I am dreaming.

The air in the room hangs thick and charged, humming with the residue of sharp words and sharper disagreements. We are gathered around a vast, imposing table of dark, gleaming wood, its surface reflecting distorted versions of our faces like figures in a carnival mirror. The debate has raged for what feels like hours, a vortex of competing egos and tightly-held convictions. Fluorescent lights overhead cast a sterile, unforgiving glare, bleaching the colour from the scene and making shadows pool darkly beneath stressed eyes.

Then, it happens. Across the reflective expanse, one of the figures leans forward, their features tightening into a mask of deliberate malice. Their voice, slick and venomous, cuts through the tense murmur, launching a projectile aimed directly at the core of my being. It's a deeply personal insult, crafted with cruel precision, designed not just to wound but to shatter my composure, to provoke that final, cathartic loss of control they seem to crave.

In that charged moment, a wildfire ignites within my chest. I feel the familiar, searing heat flood my face, a volcanic pressure building behind my temples. My vision momentarily swims, the edges of the room blurring as if viewed through heated glass. The polished table seems to stretch into an impossible distance, the sneering reflection of my adversary mocking me from across a chasm. My hands clench into fists beneath the table's edge, knuckles white, nails biting into my palms. The urge to leap across the void, to answer insult with fury, is a physical thing, a roaring beast straining against its chains within me. The air crackles, heavy with the anticipation of my eruption.

But then... something utterly strange occurs. Just as the beast is about to break free, a profound and unexpected stillness descends upon me. It's not numbness, nor detachment, but a sudden, absolute clarity, cool and crystalline like the heart of a glacier. The roaring fire within doesn't extinguish, but rather coalesces, transforming from a raging inferno into a contained, intensely bright point of light pulsating softly in my centre.

Simultaneously, the world outside me shifts. The harsh fluorescent glare softens, replaced by a warm, gentle luminescence, as if the room is now bathed in perpetual twilight. The oppressive silence breaks, filled not with angry shouts, but with the subtle, resonant hum of distant wind chimes, impossibly delicate and clear. The air grows lighter, carrying the faint scent of petrichor and night-blooming jasmine.

I look at my provoker, their face still contorted in expectation of my breakdown. But I feel no animosity, only a vast, tranquil distance. The insult, moments ago a burning brand, now feels like a pebble dropped into a bottomless well – the ripples fade almost instantly. Instead of shouting, instead of retaliating, I find myself doing something inexplicable.

Slowly, gracefully, I rise from my chair. Not by standing, but by floating. Inch by inch, I drift upwards, suspended perhaps a foot above the seat, weightless as a thistledown seed on the breeze. There's no sense of effort, only a gentle buoyancy, as if the transformed energy within me has made me lighter than air.

From this elevated perspective, the scene below takes on an ethereal quality. The strained faces around the table seem distant, their anger suddenly looking small and theatrical. My adversary's jaw hangs slightly slack, their expression morphing from malicious glee to utter bafflement. The power they sought to wield through provocation has evaporated, unable to find purchase on this new, unexpected reality.

I offer no words, just a serene, almost pitying gaze. The intense point of light within me pulses steadily, a silent assertion of an inner state they cannot touch. The wind chimes continue their phantom melody. The insult hangs, forgotten, in the fragrant air. In the strange, luminous logic of the dream, I have met their fire not with fire, but with the quiet invincibility of the deep, floating calm, leaving them stranded on the shores of their own baffled fury.
