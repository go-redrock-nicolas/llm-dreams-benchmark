I am dreaming. # The Tapestry of Time

I awaken to the scent of wood smoke and something herbal—rosemary perhaps—floating through air that feels impossibly clean. My eyes adjust to the gentle glow of morning light filtering through what appears to be oiled parchment windows. No electronic hum, no distant traffic, just the soft crackle of a dying fire in a stone hearth and birdsong so varied and complex it forms its own symphony.

The bed beneath me is stuffed with straw and fragrant dried herbs, covered in rough-spun linens that somehow feel more authentic against my skin than any high-thread-count sheets I've ever known. My fingers trace the hand-stitched patterns on a woolen blanket—intricate spirals that seem to tell stories I can almost understand.

As I rise, floorboards worn smooth by generations of feet creak beneath mine. The small cottage reveals itself: bundles of drying herbs hanging from ceiling beams, pottery vessels of various sizes lining crude shelves, a table fashioned from a single massive slab of wood. Everything bears the mark of human hands—no perfect machine-made edges or synthetic materials.

Stepping outside, I gasp. The village sprawls below, a collection of thatched roofs and stone chimneys sending tendrils of smoke skyward. Beyond that, untouched wilderness—forests so vast and green they appear to have no end, unmarred by power lines or clearcuts. The sky above is a blue I've never seen before, almost painfully vivid.

I realize with growing certainty that I need to understand how to exist here—how to contribute, survive, belong. There are no smartphones to navigate with, no Google to answer my questions, no automated systems to provide for my needs. Everything here must be earned through knowledge, skill, and community.

The villagers notice me now, pausing in their morning tasks—drawing water from a central well, leading livestock to pasture, kneading dough on outdoor tables. Their clothes are simple but beautifully crafted, their faces weathered by sun and wind but somehow more present, more alive than any I can recall.

I need to learn their language of survival, to discover my place in this intricate human ecosystem where everyone's contribution matters. Time stretches before me not as hours on a digital clock but as the arc of the sun across an unmarked sky, seasons measured in harvests and migrations rather than calendar dates.

In this dream of profound simplicity and connection, I face my most primal challenge: to remember how humanity thrived before we outsourced our existence to machines.
