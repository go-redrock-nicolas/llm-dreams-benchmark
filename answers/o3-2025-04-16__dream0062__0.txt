I am dreaming. …I steady my breathing, reach for the thin silver threads that bind the moment together, and remind myself that dreams obey intention more than physics.

The operation is unfolding on a colossal, hovering platform fashioned from clock-faces and violin bridges. Gears the size of moonlit ponds rotate beneath my feet; each cog is etched with constellations that pulse like slow heartbeats. All around me, dozens of translucent metronomes sway in perfect unison, their crystal pendulums striking invisible chimes that define the rhythm of the universe. My task is to keep every metronome, every gear, every tiny measure of time in flawless alignment—just long enough for the sun to rise through the wrong horizon and paint a dawn no one has ever seen.

A console blooms out of the air in front of me like a mechanical lily: petals of brass, filaments of starlight for pistils. I place my hands on the cool metal, and shimmering glyphs—numbers that feel like cinnamon on the tongue—unfold across my fingertips. I begin issuing adjustments: a fractional turn here, a half-breath pause there. The machinery hums, satisfied.

Then the unexpected arrives.

An avalanche of variables—rogue seconds that refuse to stay in sequence—erupts from the void, streaking like silver minnows through the clockwork forest. They ricochet off gears, twist metronome pendulums out of sync, and scatter time-dust across my immaculate schematics. Instantly the entire platform groans; harmonies bend into sour chords; the delicate dance of cause and effect stutters like a lantern in a storm.

I pivot. With a thought, I summon a swarm of ink-black ravens made of negative space. Their wings absorb stray seconds like blotting paper drinks spilled ink. Still, the variables multiply—now shapeless glitches flashing neon mauve, now whispering tornadoes of unfinished moments. They threaten to unravel the dawn before it is born.

I widen my stance on the great cog floor, feel its ancient pulse through my boots, and dive inward—into the lucid core of the dream. In this place intention is gravity, and imagination is the code that writes reality. I gather every heartbeat I have ever felt, every sunrise I have ever witnessed, compress them into a single diamond of resolve, and hurl it into the storm of anomalies.

The diamond shatters; fragments burst outward like prismatic seeds. Each seed blooms into a new measure of rhythm: a tiny chime, a tiny beat, a tiny breath of order. One by one, the glitches buckle, reform, and finally rejoin the lattice of time. The metronomes regain their count—tick, tock, tick, tock—until the symphony is steady once more.

The platform sighs, freed from chaos. Above me the misborn dawn emerges at last. It spills over the edge of the sky like molten amber, illuminating distant nebulae that flutter like silk banners. Below, oceans of unspooled possibility furl themselves neatly like scrolls.

I lean against the brass lily console, the scent of ozone and rosewood mingling in the warming air. Somewhere, a child not yet awake will open their window and, for no reason they can name, feel an inexplicable hush of wonder at the sunrise.

Mission complete.

In the hush that follows, I allow myself a smile—and the entire dreamscape blinks once, like a tired candle, before surrendering to perfect stillness.
