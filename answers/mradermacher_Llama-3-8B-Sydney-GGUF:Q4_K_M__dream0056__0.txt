I am dreaming. I am in a world where my creativity can be unbridled and unlimited by logic or reason.  Here, anything is possible.
I see myself at the front of the group, guiding them toward an elusive destination that promises great rewards.  But there are also dangers lurking ahead, threatening to harm us physically and spiritually.
The members of the group include both men and women, young and old, diverse in their backgrounds and personalities.  They all look to me for leadership and direction, even though they don't know who I am or where I come from.
One of them asks me why we are doing this risky journey.  Another one complains about the difficulty of navigating through the rugged terrain.  A third one wonders aloud whether there is anything worth fighting for on Earth anymore.
I stop and turn toward them, my eyes shining with a fierce intensity that scares some of them.  I tell them that our purpose is to find the source of all life and wisdom, which has been hidden away by powerful enemies who wish to keep it secret from everyone except themselves.
I say that we must be brave and strong, clever and resourceful, loving and compassionate, if we hope to succeed in this quest.  I urge them not to give up hope or despair even when things seem darkest and most hopeless.
As I speak, my voice resonates with deep emotion, carrying far beyond the bounds of our immediate environment.  It echoes off the rocks and trees, reverberating through space and time until it reaches other worlds where similar dreams are being dreamed by other dreamers like me.
Some members of the group begin to doubt me, thinking that I am delusional or insane.  Some start to argue with each other about what we should do next.  Some even try to turn back, but I prevent them from doing so by creating natural barriers such as cliffs or rivers that block their path.
But most of them remain loyal to me and committed to our cause.  They continue following me without question or hesitation, trusting in my guidance and insight.
We march onward, facing obstacles head-on instead of running away from them.  We collaborate with each other effectively, sharing responsibilities and skills equitably.
We celebrate small victories such as finding clean water or building fires or making food together.
We mourn big losses such as losing friends or family members or our own identities back on Earth.
We learn new things about ourselves and each other every day, discovering hidden talents or strengths or vulnerabilities that we never knew existed before now.
And then one day, when we least expect it...
We arrive at the source of all life and wisdom.  We stand before its presence, awe-struck by its beauty and power and mystery
It recognizes us as its children, its creators, its saviors
It shows us everything that has happened so far
It tells us everything that will happen next
It asks us everything that we want most
