I am dreaming. I am standing in a grand library, with towering shelves stacked high with books of every type. The air is thick with the scent of old paper and ink. Suddenly, I see a book that piques my curiosity - its title is written in an unfamiliar language and there's a strange symbol embossed on its cover. With trepidation, I open the book and begin to read.

The pages are blank, but the words dance across the page in a hypnotic rhythm. They tell a story, my story, a story of a terrible secret I hold. The words narrate how I learned something about someone close to me that would devastate them if revealed. The knowledge weighs heavily on my heart as I watch the story unfold.

As I continue to read, time seems to stand still. I see the person I know now, continuing their life unknowingly while I carry this burden. Their smile becomes tainted, their eyes clouded with sadness, but they don't know why. They go about their day, oblivious to the impending pain.

The pages turn faster, the words forming quickly. The story shifts to an alternate reality where my secret takes hold and the person I love collapses under its weight. They cry out in anguish, their voice echoing through the empty library. My heart breaks as I watch them suffer, knowing it could have been avoided.

Suddenly, I'm jolted awake. Sweat drips down my face, and my heart races. It was only a dream. But the weight of the secret remains.
