I am dreaming.

I stand under a lavender-tinged sky, the sun a smoldering ruby caught behind thin veils of cloud. Marble causeways spiral outward like the whorls of a shell, linking tier upon tier of emerald-roofed pavilions. Their eaves curve like the wings of cranes frozen in mid-flight, painted with cinnabar dragons whose bodies shimmer whenever the wind breathes across them.  

I am the envoy of a distant kingdom, my memory of how I arrived here blurred the way ink blurs in rain. The people of this realm, the Vaelori, move with an eerie grace—each gesture a syllable in a language of posture. Bronze bells sewn into the hems of their robes ring out in delicate chords; every note is rumored to carry a social meaning heavier than any spoken word.

Tonight I attend the Ceremony of Ten Thousand Lanterns, where alliances are sealed by exchanging light. A silk-clad attendant presses a lantern into my hands: a sphere of translucent jade, its interior flame fed by fragrant sandalwood oil. I am told to set it afloat on the Mirror Lake precisely when the imperial gongs toll nine times.  

I miscount.

On the eighth toll, the lake’s surface still golden with early dusk, I lower the lantern—eager to please, eager to belong—and release it. A thousand faces pivot toward me at once. A hush falls so complete I can hear the lonely sigh of the wind winding through the pavilion arches. The ninth gong drifts across the water an instant later, like judgment arriving a heartbeat after the crime.

I have broken the Code of Still Waters: to release a lantern before the ninth chime is to imply that the Empress’s reign will not endure to the next stroke of time. It is an omen of dethronement, a wish for twilight to swallow her sun.

Two ivory-armored Sentinels glide forward; masks of hammered gold hide their expressions. My stomach plunges as if stones were tied to it. I try to explain—language falters, words dissolve. In the dream’s elastic logic, my voice becomes a flutter of paper scraps carried away by wind.

They escort me beneath the Bridge of Quiet Regret into a moon-white courtyard. The stones underfoot hold the chill of centuries. There stands Mistress Isarien, the court’s Arbiter of Echoes, tasked with weighing intention versus consequence. Her hair is woven with ice-blue threads that sparkle like distant stars.

She produces a thin scroll brushed with phosphorescent ink; symbols crawl across it like living vines. “Your lantern flew before its hour,” she intones, “casting a shadow long enough to bruise a throne. Do you bring ruin—or do you seek redress?”

Dream logic offers me choices like petals swirling in a whirlpool. I remember a rumor I overheard in a spice-scented marketplace—that in Vaelori custom, a faux-pas may be annulled by presenting a Counter-Light: a lantern fueled by one’s own breath, signifying life offered back to balance insult.

I inhale until my lungs burn, exhale into cupped palms, and from the mist of my breath a fragile orb of pale fire gathers. It hovers—first a tremulous spark, then a full globe, opalescent and trembling like a baby star. I kneel, holding it out with both hands. Its glow paints my face with shifting hues: penitence, hope, fear.

Mistress Isarien studies me as if peering through the layers of a pearl. Then she nods once, the gesture as slight as a leaf settling on water. She raises her hand; the Sentinels withdraw. My makeshift lantern drifts upward of its own accord, joining the hundreds above the lake. It settles into formation, beating in the sky like one more silver heart among many.

When I lift my eyes I see the Empress herself upon a high balcony, robes unfurling like storm clouds roped with sunlight. She inclines her head—no more than the tilt of a petal—but the entire court exhales in unison, relief rippling outward like concentric rings on still water.

The ritual musicians resume; flutes made of glass whisper over the hush. Petal-shaped fireworks ascend, bursting into cascading chrysanthemums of green and violet. The sky is suddenly alive with light and absolution.

I feel the dream loosening its hold. The marble beneath my feet becomes porous, dissolving into star-flecked mist. Lanterns rise faster now, tugging the heavens open, revealing a corridor of shimmering night.

A final echo from Mistress Isarien drifts to me: “Remember, envoy: intention is a seed, but timing is the soil. Sow wisely.”

The lavender sky fades to the color of unspun silk. Lanterns turn into scattered embers, then fireflies, then nothing at all. I am left floating in velvety darkness, the hush of my own breath the only sound—until morning’s light calls me awake.
