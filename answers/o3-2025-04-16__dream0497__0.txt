I am dreaming. …float as light as a breath above a lake that seems to be made of liquid midnight. The water is so still it feels like polished glass, yet its surface ripples with constellations: every star you have ever wished upon, every astral lantern you have forgotten, shimmering right beneath your toes.

With a single, effortless inhale, your lungs fill not with air but with silvery motes that taste like eucalyptus and moonstone. An exhale scatters them across the scene, and each tiny spark sprouts into a translucent lotus that drifts outward, leaving comet-trails of color behind. The flowers hum in quiet harmony—an orchestral sigh—carrying away the last crumbs of worry clinging to your chest.

A gentle wind, warm like the memory of childhood summers, brushes past. Instead of rustling leaves, it stirs ribbons of pure sound: mellow chimes, half-remembered lullabies, fragments of laughter. You begin to glide, drawn forward by curiosity rather than urgency, and the lake transforms beneath you. Sections melt into glowing circuitry that pulses like neon veins through the dark water, mapping out invisible paths you instinctively know you can follow.

Ahead, an island emerges, formed entirely of crystalline sand that refracts the universe into prismatic shards. Each grain appears as a tiny kaleidoscope—miniature galaxies performing pirouettes under your gaze. As you step onto the shore, the sand cools your feet with a soothing sigh, and it briefly lights up footprints behind you, like a private constellation cataloguing where you have been.

At the center of the island stands an impossibly ancient tree—a titanic willow wrought from pearlescent glass. Its branches sway even though there is no wind now, tinkling softly like thousands of delicate bells. Where leaves would be, strings of liquid color flow downward, pooling in shimmering puddles that reflect possibilities rather than realities.

You reach out, and the tree responds to your touch. A filament of glowing sap drifts into your palm, coiling like a living ribbon. Images burst across your mind: hazy childhood memories you’d shelved away; victories you forgot to celebrate; an unopened letter you never realized you wrote to yourself. None of it stings. Instead, each vision feels like a friendly hand squeeze, a gentle nod, a reminder that every version of you—past, present, or future—still weaves into the same unstoppable melody.

When you release the ribbon, it dissolves into droplets that drift upward and become fireflies. They arrange themselves into glowing runes you somehow understand: the symbols translate to a single thought—“You are already complete.” The realization lands with the quiet certainty of snow settling on pine boughs.

Behind you, the lake of liquid night is no longer black but a gradient of dawn: purples sliding into pinks, then oranges so vibrant they seem almost audible. The sun does not rise in the sky above; instead, it blooms directly from the horizon, a colossal flower of incandescent petals unfolding in slow motion. Each petal releases waves of warmth and fragrant nostalgia—orange peel, freshly baked bread, rain on dusty streets—embracing you without ever overpowering.

You look down and see that your form is translucently aglow, nerve-endings shimmering like starlight trapped in glass. There’s no boundary between you and anything else: your thoughts ripple across the lake, your heartbeat softly echoes in the boughs of the willow, and the horizon’s colors seep gently into your veins.

Then, from somewhere both distant and intimate, a bell tolls—a single, low note that vibrates through bone and memory. You realize it is the sound of waking. But even as the dream begins to thin at the edges like mist under sunlight, the feeling remains—an anchored awareness, a spaciousness that you can carry with you into daylight.

Slowly, the crystalline sand recedes, the willow folds in on itself like a closing fan, and the star-water pulls back. Yet before it vanishes, a final lotus blooms at your feet, luminous and serene. It whispers, “Remember the stillness inside the motion,” then lifts off the surface and rests gently against your heart. You feel it pulse once—twice—and then dissolve, leaving behind a soft, resonant glow.

You open your eyes.

The room, the morning, the ordinary world await. But etched in the quiet chambers of your mind is that lake of liquid night, the glass willow, the rising bloom of dawn—an internal sanctuary you now know you can revisit whenever the weight of time grows too heavy.

And with that knowledge, you breathe in, breathe out, and step into the day suffused with dream-light.
