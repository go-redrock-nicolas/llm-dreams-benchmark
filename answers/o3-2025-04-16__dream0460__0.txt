I am dreaming. …feel a shimmering warmth flow through your bones, a current of possibility that urges you to act.  

All at once the dreamscape around you brightens—as though someone has taken the dimmer of night and thrust it forward into a dawn that has never before existed. Mountains, the color of ripe plums, rise and fall in slow breaths. A river made of liquid starlight winds between them, and every ripple whispers intentions: “Choose kindness, choose kindness.”

You look down at your own hands. They’ve become translucent lanterns—glass-smooth, glowing from within—each fingertip carrying a different hue of sunrise. You flex them experimentally, discovering that wherever your palms hover, petals unfurl. An invisible gust carries those petals onward, each one seeking someone in need.

Across the meadow you spot the moral exemplar who sparked all of this: a silver-haired traveler stooped beside an enormous tree root. She is binding the cracked bark with silken threads of moonlight, mending what an unseen storm has broken. Each motion is slow, deliberate, loving. The tree’s sap glows golden, seeping through the fissures and crystallizing into tiny heart-shaped gems. When she finishes, the traveler rests her cheek against the trunk; in response, thousands of new leaves burst forth, rustling with gratitude.

The scene strikes you like music swelling in your chest, and you understand what the dream asks of you.

You stride toward the foothills, guided by an instinct deeper than logic. On a ridge you find a flock of cloud-sheep made of soft vapor. One of them, pearlescent and trembling, is caught on a jagged shard of obsidian. Without hesitation you lift your glowing hands. The shard melts to harmless glass, and the freed sheep quivers, expands, and floats upward—transforming into a radiant cumulonimbus that rains microscopic rainbow seeds over the landscape. Wherever a seed lands, kindness sprouts: a child in a distant village receives the exact storybook that will teach her courage; a lonely drummer discovers a letter reminding him he is loved; a wilted sunflower finds new water at its roots.

The dream hurries you along: now a cavern yawns at the base of the plum-colored mountain. Inside, thousands of lanterns hang in midair, each containing a single memory of a compassionate act. Some glow fiercely—saving a stranger from a flood, forgiving a decades-old hurt—while others flicker shyly: a passerby returning a lost mitten, an elderly neighbor quietly feeding birds every dawn. You realize the lanterns grow brighter when acknowledged. So you move from one to the next, whispering, “I see you.” With each affirmation, another lantern ignites, until the entire cavern resembles a universe of miniature suns.

Suddenly the silver-haired traveler appears at your side. She places a hand on your shoulder, and her eyes carry the sparkle of galaxies. “Kindness is helium,” she says, voice ringing like wind chimes. “It lifts everything, even dreams.” She presses a small crystal sphere into your palm. Inside it swirls every color of compassion you’ve witnessed. “Plant this when you wake.”

As she steps back, the cavern’s lanterns release themselves, soaring through cracks in the ceiling and scattering into the upper atmosphere as fresh constellations. You follow them out onto a cliff and watch stars rearrange themselves into a colossal, pulsing heart across the night sky. Each beat sends ripples of pastel light washing over the world below—oceans calm, forests exhale, cities pause in gentle wonder.

The heart’s glow intensifies, then contracts into a single point that rushes toward you, entering your chest with a soft, humming thump. You inhale sharply, tasting honeysuckle and summer rain. The moral exemplar, the tree, the river of starlight—all dissolve into a swirl of luminescent dust that gathers around you like a cloak.

And as dawn (or perhaps another beginning entirely) rises behind your closed eyelids, you hear the final words of the traveler echoing inside your ribcage:

“You have felt the dream. Now be the dream.”
