I am dreaming. You are in a vast, ornate courtroom. The air is heavy with a cold, metallic chill, and the shadows seem to breathe as they shift in the dim, unearthly light. At the center, towering over all else, is an immense stone table. Its surface is etched with faint, intricate symbols, glFast-growing over the table, diffusing a dim, ethereal green glow. Only those closest to you appear in sharp focus; the rest of the crowd fades into a shifting, ghostly haze. The rows of seats are packed with men, women, and children, each silent, each watching you with an unreadable, silent gaze. Some rest their foreheads in their hands, others clutch at their chests, and others writhe as if in silent agony.

You are holding a wide, rolled parchment in your trembling hands. Inside are the names of thousands of patients, each with their own unique and heartbreaking story. You know every doctor believes their patient's case is the most urgent. You know that each person here believes their life is the most important. You know that you have to allocate the limited treatments among these thousands of patients, knowing that not everyone will receive the care they desperately need, and some will ultimately be left to suffer or die.

How do you carry this burden

As you start to read the names aloud, the room becomes a cacophony of whispered pleas, sobs, and murmurs.

"Please, save my child."

"I've lost my husband, save my wife."

"I have three little children at home, what will happen to them?"

The sheer volume of voices and the weight of their pain are crushing. 

Then, without warning, the faces around you start to turn into shadows. The voices grow distant, and the glowing light above the table flickers as if reaching its last breath. You feel an overwhelming urge to make the right choices, to save as many lives as possible, but the pressure is crushing, and you wake with a gasp.

As you open your eyes in your own bed, you are left with the chilling impression of the faces still etched in your mind. The echoes of their voices haunt you as you lie in the silence, realizing the nightmare is not just a dream but a burden you might have to carry in your waking life.
