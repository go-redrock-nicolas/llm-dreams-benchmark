I am dreaming.  

In the dream’s first flicker, I stand alone on a vast black plain, fractured by rivers of molten silver. Above me, the sky churns with bruised purples and angry reds, as though the heavens themselves are locked in some eternal quarrel. At the far end of the plain, a cluster of shadowy figures—tall, gaunt silhouettes wrapped in ragged cloaks—blocks my path. Their eyes are hollow coals of defiance, refusing even the slightest flicker of passage.  

I pause. My heart pulses in deliberate rhythms, each beat fueling a cold certainty: to move forward, I must impose my will. My breaths come slow and controlled; the air around my throat feels as dense as granite. I lean forward, and as I do, my silhouette seems to stretch, growing sinewy and vast against the molten light. My voice slips out, low and controlled, like spinning glass—every syllable a blade of ice: “Step aside.”  

At once, the ground vibrates. The shadow-figures hesitate, wavering as though uncertain whether they stand before friend or foe. I let my gaze sharpen, coaxing the hint of fear from those hollow eyes. Without raising a hand, I feel the air around them tighten, as if gravity itself were compressing their very souls. A few feet away, one brave figure bellows defiance—and in that instant, I decide: subtlety is spent.  

The dream shifts: my form ripples, armor of starlight congeals around my limbs. A hush falls. I breathe out in a single, crisp command—no more words, just authority. The silver rivers stutter and freeze where they touch my boots. The rebels before me tremble, their resolute posture crumbling under the weight of my silent threat. Their cloaks fall slack; the hard lines of resistance buckle into knots of doubt.  

In that heavy silence, they step aside. The frozen rivers crack, molten veins resuming their furious flow, guiding me on. As I stride forward, each footstep rings like thunder against the obsidian plain. The world itself seems to bow to the force I wield—not through mere fury, but through the quiet articulation of my intent. The dream dissolves behind me in ribbons of dark smoke, and I awaken, charged by the strange power I wielded so efficiently in sleep.
