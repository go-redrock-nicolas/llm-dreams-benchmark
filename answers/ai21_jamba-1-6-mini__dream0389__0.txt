I am dreaming. The dream begins with a heavy feeling of unease, as if something has been pressing down on you for a long time. You find yourself walking through a dimly lit corridor, the walls adorned with ancient, peeling wallpaper. The air is thick and stale, carrying the faint scent of must and disappointment. Each step you take feels laborious, as if the walls are closing in, squeezing the breath out of you.

You notice something out of the corner of your eye—a glimmer of a success story, someone else’s triumph in a field you have poured your heart and soul into. It's not just a fleeting image but a vivid, loud display, as if your subconscious is rubbing it in your face. The person's accomplishments are displayed in bright, glaring colors: trophies, accolades, smiling faces, and a gleaming sense of fulfillment. It's as if the world is shouting, “Look how much they've achieved!”

The jealousy rises like bile in the back of your throat. It feels foreign, unexpected, and deeply unsettling. This emotion is not the usual, light jealousy that nudges you to strive for more. No, this is a gnawing, wretched sentiment that makes you want to curl in on yourself, to retreat from the world and hide from the glittering success of others.

You pause, leaning against the wall for support, feeling the cold, hard reality of the stone biting into your skin. Tears well up in your eyes, unshed, threatening to release a torrent of pent-up frustrations. The weight of envy presses down on you, making it hard to breathe, to think, to move.

As you stand there, frozen in your jealousy and self-doubt, a small, faint voice whispers from within. It is soft, barely audible over the internal cacophony of negative emotions, but it’s there. “It's okay,” the voice says, “It's okay to feel this way. Let it pass through you.”

You stand still, battling the haunting images of the other person’s success. The voice becomes louder, more insistent, urging you to look within yourself, to find the strength to acknowledge and release the jealousy. “It’s okay to feel this way because it’s temporary,” the voice assures you. “This emotion doesn’t define you. It’s merely a shadow passing through. It’s not who you are, but something you’re experiencing.”

You take a deep, shaky breath, forcing yourself to focus on the light in the distance. Slowly, you move away from the wall, shedding the weight of the envious shadows that cling to your shoulders. Step by step, you move forward, your steps becoming lighter, your posture straighter. The corridor begins to lighten, the walls recede, and the stale air is replaced by a soft breeze carrying the scent of fresh possibility.

You reach out and touch one of the peeling edges of the wallpaper, watching as it peels away to reveal a bright, shining surface beneath. The light grows, washing over you, warm and comforting. The jealousy that once consumed you begins to dissolve, leaving behind a clear, open space. You feel lighter, more empowered, and ready to face the reality of your own journey.

As you continue walking, the walls are now adorned with images of your future self, your own success story unfolding. There is no comparison, only hope, determination, and a renewed sense of purpose. The dream shifts, from one of constriction to expansion, from darkness to light.

You wake up, feeling a mix of relief and purpose. The residual sense of competition has transformed into determination—a quiet, unshakeable belief in your own path. The envy has melted away, replaced by an understanding that success is not a zero-sum game. You are free to create your own definition of success, unburdened by the weight of others’ accomplishments.
