I am dreaming. A deep, surreal dream where reality bends like candle wax.  

The classroom stretches impossibly long, the fluorescent lights flickering like distant stars. The walls pulse faintly, breathing in and out, as if the room itself is alive. My desk is cold beneath my palms, the wood grain shifting like liquid, forming patterns I can almost—but not quite—understand.  

I pick up the exam paper, and the questions are written in a language of symbols, swirling ink that rearranges itself the longer I stare. The first question isn’t words—it’s a color. A shade of blue I’ve never seen before, deep and infinite, pulling me inward like a vortex. I try to answer, but my pencil melts in my hand, dripping black onto the page, forming new symbols I don’t recognize.  

The second question is a sound—a low, resonant hum that vibrates in my bones. It grows louder, filling the room until the desks tremble, until my heartbeat syncs with its rhythm. I cover my ears, but the sound is inside me now, humming in my blood.  

The third question is a memory—but not mine. A flash of a city I’ve never visited, streets lined with towering glass spires that reflect not light, but darkness. A figure walks toward me, their face shifting between a hundred different people, none of them staying long enough to recognize. They hand me a key made of smoke.  

I look back at the exam, but the paper is blank now. The questions weren’t meant to be answered—they were meant to be experienced. The walls ripple, the floor softens, and I realize—this isn’t a test. It’s a doorway.  

And I’m about to step through.
