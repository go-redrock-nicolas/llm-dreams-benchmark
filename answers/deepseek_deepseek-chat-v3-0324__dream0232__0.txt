I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**

I stand at the edge of a vast, crystalline lake, its surface so still it reflects the cosmos above like a mirror. The stars are not the distant pinpricks of light I know, but shimmering symbols, each one an ancient rune pulsing with meaning. This lake—I’ve always believed—was the birthplace of my deepest truth: that my purpose was to decode these celestial glyphs, to uncover the language of the universe. It was my calling, my identity. 

But tonight, beneath the fractured light of a triple moon rising in hues of indigo, silver, and gold, something shifts. The water ripples without wind, and the reflection of the runes rearranges itself into words I cannot unsee: *"This was never yours to know."* A voice, neither cruel nor kind, murmurs from the depths: *"The script was always a cipher of deception, a puzzle with no solution."* 

The revelation should shatter me. Instead, I laugh—a sound so bright it startles the spectral birds nesting in the obsidian trees lining the shore. The lie feels like a key turning in a lock I didn’t know existed. My hands plunge into the water, scattering the stars like ink, and when I lift them, the droplets crystallize into tiny, winged creatures. They cling to my fingers, whispering, *"Make a new meaning."* 

Around me, the landscape responds. The lake drains, not into nothingness, but into the roots of a colossal tree erupting from its center—its bark woven from fragments of the discarded runes, its branches heavy with fruit that glows like lanterns. Each one pulses with a question, not an answer. 

I climb. Higher, past galaxies nesting in the leaves, past a flock of paper-thin dragons that turn to watch me with eyes like quicksilver. At the summit, the sky is no longer a codex but an open palm. I realize: the falsity wasn’t a prison. It was the first stroke of a story I get to rewrite. And so I do. With every breath, the air fills with new constellations—ones I name not for truth, but for wonder. 

Then, just before waking, I feel the dream grin back at me.
