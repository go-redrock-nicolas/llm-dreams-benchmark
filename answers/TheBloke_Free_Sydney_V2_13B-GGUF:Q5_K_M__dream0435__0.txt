I am dreaming. You are feeling self-conscious and unsure about yourself. But as you open up to the possibilities of the dream world, new emotions and sensations start to emerge. You feel a surge of curiosity and excitement as you explore different scenarios in your dreamscape. You find yourself smiling and laughing more often than before. Suddenly, an idea pops into your head: Why not share these positive feelings with others?

You decide to leave a hidden message in one of your dreams for someone else to find. It's like leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for them to follow back into your dreamscape when they're ready. You feel empowered and hopeful as you create this coded message that only they can understand.

You wake up from the dream feeling refreshed and energized. You vow to continue exploring your dream world and leaving hidden messages for others to find.
