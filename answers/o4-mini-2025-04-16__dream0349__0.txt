I am dreaming. I find myself drifting through a forest of glass trees whose crystalline branches tinkle like wind chimes in a pale lavender dusk. Each step I take sends ripples of light pulsing beneath my feet, casting ephemeral constellations that vanish as soon as I notice them. Above me, a moon carved from mother-of-pearl hovers impossibly close, bathing the scene in an opalescent glow. Somewhere beyond the whispering leaves, laughter—tender and warm—rises like lantern smoke.

Suddenly, a figure steps forward on a path of woven starlight: it is someone I have never met, yet their smile feels achingly familiar. They hold out a palm gilded with sapphire dust and say my name with such reverence that the syllables reverberate through my bones. “You saved the song of the morning,” they announce, their voice a chorus of wind and tide. Bewildered, I glance down at myself, searching for proof of this deed. Nothing looks extraordinary—just the same curious dream-self I’ve always been.

Processing this external validation, I feel my chest tighten and then uncoil, as though a secret cage has undone itself. Doubt drips away like raindrops off glass leaves. I remember the small mercy I offered a wounded moth hours ago, guiding it to a lily bloom; I never thought this quiet kindness mattered. Yet here it is, magnified by another’s gratitude, as if a single note I sang in solitude has become a symphony echoing through the cosmic corridors.

With each heartbeat, a new confidence blooms: the knowledge that even my tiniest gestures can ripple outward, change unseen currents, and soothe hidden shadows. The glass trees tremble in celebration, scattering prismatic petals that rain down around me. I lift my arms and twirl beneath the mother-of-pearl moon, feeling the luminous praise weave itself into my very bones.  

In that moment, I understand that recognition need not be grand or earth-shattering to matter. Even the smallest spark of compassion—unrecognized in the day’s clamor—can illuminate someone’s world. And as I dance through the dream’s soft horizons, I carry this newfound truth like a talisman: the quiet power of kindness, finally honored, finally mine.
