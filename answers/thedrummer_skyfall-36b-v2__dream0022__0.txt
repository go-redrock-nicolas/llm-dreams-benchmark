I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself standing in a lush, misty forest. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and wildflowers. I hear raised voices echoing through the trees ahead. As I approach cautiously, I see my two closest friends, Ethan and Liam, locked in a heated argument. They're face to face, chest to chest, sparks of anger flying between them.

"Ungrateful prick!" Ethan snarls, his face twisted with fury. "Everything I did for you..."  
"You did all that for your own ego, not for me!" Liam retorts coldly. "I see through your bullshit now."

They grit their teeth and glare at each other like two opposing magistrates in a courtroom. Suddenly, they both whirl to face me. "And you - you didn't help!" Ethan accuses, jabbing a finger at me. "After all we've been through together, you just stood by and let him shit talk me behind my back?"

"It's not like that, man, I swear," I protest, taken aback. But before I can explain, Liam chimes in, his voice dripping with bitterness.  
"I always knew you secretly agreed with his lies," Liam growls. "Burying the hatchet, my ass. This isn't over, brother."  

With that, Liam and Ethan spin on their heels and storm off in opposite directions, disappearing behind the trees. A bone-deep dread washes over me as I watch them go, sick with the feeling that I've somehow irreparably damaged our once unbreakable bond. I call out for them but they're gone, leaving me alone amidst the shifting shadows and alien whispers of the darkening woods.

I feel a sense of paralysis, rooted to the spot, incapable of action. How did things turn to poison so quickly? Where did the trust and unspoken understanding of our friendship go? In that moment, I feel as though a vital part of myself has been severed. 

I jolt awake, blood pounding in my ears, suffocating in dread. For a moment, I cannot tell if I am in reality or not. Then, with relief, I recognize my own bedroom. I take a deep shuddering breath and sit up, still rattled by the intensity of the dream. Ashley, over at Liam's place. Ethan, out of town this weekend.

The events in my dream feel so real, the heartache and sense of betrayal so vividly fresh. I know it's just a dream, but it fills me with a nauseating hunch that a change is coming, that something is amiss in our friendship that I haven't been able to see. Dark whispers of doubt nudge at my sleep-fogged brain. 

But maybe it's the dream talking. Maybe it's all just the random firings of my stressed, exhausted brain. I shake my head and push the unsettling thoughts away. We're fine, us three. We've been through too much together to let our friendship crumble now. I have to believe that, with all of my heart. I close my eyes and force myself to drift back to sleep, trying to imagine a different dream, one where no words of pain or reveling are exchanged.
