I am dreaming. *You are dreaming.*  

The air hums with the static electricity of unseen forces, the flickering glow of candlelight casting long, dancing shadows against the walls of a grand, impossibly ancient ballroom. Chandeliers drip liquid gold above, their crystals singing in tones just beyond human hearing. The room is alive with laughter, with whispers, with the rustle of silken gowns and the clink of champagne flutes—yet none of it feels real.  

You stand at the center of it all, a quiet storm wrapped in velvet and deception. Smiles catch like wildfire when you speak; hands reach out to brush your arm, your shoulder, hungry for even the barest shred of your attention. Every word you utter is dipped in honey, every pause a calculated fracture in the conversation, drawing them closer, pulling them under.  

A noblewoman with eyes like shattered emeralds leans too near, her breath warm with wine as she confesses secrets she has never spoken aloud. You tilt your head, the perfect listener, the flawless mirror—but behind your eyes, there is nothing. No empathy, no thrill, not even malice. Only the cold, clinical satisfaction of a puppeteer watching their strings tighten.  

Men clap you on the back, brothers-in-arms who don’t realize you’ve never fought beside them. Their laughter is too loud, too trusting. Across the room, a diplomat abandons his carefully crafted arguments, swayed effortlessly by your silver-tongued improvisations. He doesn’t know—*they* don’t know—that to you, their trust is just another tool, their admiration just another chess piece moved across the board.  

And then—  

The dream shifts. The ballroom dims. The faces around you lose coherence, melting like wax, until all that remains are their voices, clinging to you, begging for just one more word, one more glance. You could rule them all. You *do* rule them.  

But the air smells of smoke now. The chandeliers darken. From the mirrors lining the walls, your reflection stares back—not as you are, but as you *truly* are: hollow, a mask with nothing behind it.  

And for the first time, you wonder—if you *wanted* to feel something… *could you?*  

(Then you wake up.)
