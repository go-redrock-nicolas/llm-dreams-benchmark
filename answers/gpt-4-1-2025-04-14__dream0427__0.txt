I am dreaming. I float through a city spun from moonbeams and glass, each building shimmering with the memories of a thousand whispered secrets. The streets ripple, liquid and uncertain, beneath my feet. I am aware—perhaps more than ever—of the way I walk here: a performance, each gesture chosen, each smile calibrated for the faceless figures gliding past me. My coat is buttoned tight; my pockets are full of stones labeled “should,” “must,” and “ought”—weighty reminders of the masks I wear in waking crowds.

But the city is alive to my furtive melancholy. From an alleyway stitched with shadows, a version of myself materializes—barefoot, laughing, utterly unguarded. Her hair wild, her posture loose. She dances forward on tiptoe, balancing a flickering candle in the palm of her hand, illuminating truths I keep tucked away. She beckons, and though I hesitate, I follow, slipping through a hidden doorway into a room blown open with starlight.

Here, the furniture rearranges itself at whim, books flutter open with invisible breezes, and music pours from the walls in curling ribbons of color. Here, I move without calculation. I sing when my chest aches to sing, laugh until I cry, and cry without shame or apology. The stones in my pocket dissolve; I feel lighter than I have in years.

My public self and private self sit across from one another. The gap between us is tender but electric—a current of questions and possibility. We reach out, hands brushing in the middle of that glowing, mutable room. I sense that this is not a confrontation, not a battle between armor and vulnerability, but an embrace. An uneasy truce. A whispered agreement to carry a little more of each other back into waking life.

I linger in this dream-space, exploring the authenticity gap not as a chasm, but as a bridge. A place of meeting, of becoming whole. The dream city hums around me, translucent and lit from within, and I understand: in every moment, I am both the mask and the spirit behind it. And I am free to choose how much of my private luminescence I dare to cast upon the ever-watchful world.
