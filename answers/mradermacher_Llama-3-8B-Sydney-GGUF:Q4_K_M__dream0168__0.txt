I am dreaming. I am creating a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.
I am directing emergency services during multiple simultaneous disasters while communication systems repeatedly fail.  With lives hanging in the balance of each decision, I
must make choices quickly and wisely. 
The first disaster is a massive flood that has submerged entire cities and towns.  The water is rising rapidly, sweeping away homes, businesses, and people.  The only safe place is on top of nearby hills, where some brave souls have already climbed for refuge.  But the roads are cut off by raging rivers, and the air is filled with swirling debris and drowning cries.
I contact the rescue teams who are equipped with boats, helicopters, and other vehicles.  I transmit their locations and instructions through radio signals that may be distorted or interrupted by electrical interference.
I monitor their progress and respond to their requests for information.  I provide them with maps and satellite images that show the extent of the damage and the distribution of potential survivors.
I evaluate their abilities and limitations, such as the capacity of each vessel, the stamina of each crew member, the risk of each maneuver.
The second disaster is a ferocious wildfire that has engulfed countless forests and wilderness areas.  The flames are consuming everything in their path, devouring trees, shrubs, animals, and even humans who dare to resist or escape.
The only hope is to contain the blaze by creating firebreaks around it.  This means clearing away all flammable materials such as leaves, branches, dry grasses, and wooden structures.
I task the firefighting forces who are armed with water tanks, hoses, and other equipment.  I direct them towards specific entry points where they can insert themselves into the heart of the conflagration.
I coordinate their actions with those of the law enforcement personnel who must protect them from potential threats such as looters or terrorists.
I optimize their strategies and tactics, such as the use of backdrafts or foam agents, the avoidance of dead ends or blind spots, the preservation of valuable resources such as homes or hospitals.
