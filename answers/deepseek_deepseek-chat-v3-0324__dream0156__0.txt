I am dreaming. The glow of the phone screen bleeds into my surroundings, warping the world around me into a sickly digital landscape. My fingers move of their own accord, scrolling endlessly through an infinite feed that stretches into the void. Each post burns into my retinas—flickering like dying stars in a vast cosmos of curated personas.  

Suddenly, beneath the screen, I spot a crack—a deep, jagged line spreading like spider silk across the glass. A muffled voice whispers from within the device, barely audible beneath the hypnotic hum of notifications. It grows louder, clearer—my own voice, distorted and fragmented, repeating back every half-hearted "like," every rushed comment, every passive scroll.  

Then, the phone shatters.  

When the glass breaks, it doesn't fall—it melts into liquid data, pooling at my feet before rising in twisting tendrils, encasing my arms, my throat. The feed doesn't stop; now it projects directly onto my skin, lines of text scrolling over my veins, videos playing across my eyelids when I blink.  

A gust of wind tears through—real, bitingly cold—and the feeds stutter. The glow dims. A shadow passes over me—not a notification, not an ad, but something vast and silent. It pulls at the data clinging to me, stripping it away strand by strand, like peeling back layers of dead skin.  

For the first time in what feels like years, my hands are empty. The air tastes like rain. Somewhere, beyond the wreckage of pixels, birds sing.  

Then, just before waking, a single notification pulses in the corner of my vision.
