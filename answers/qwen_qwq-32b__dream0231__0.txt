I am dreaming. The stars are weaving through the sky like a ribbon of forgotten melodies, each one humming a different note as they pass. My breath crystallizes into tiny snowflakes that hover and spin, leaving trails of shimmering stardust behind them. Below me, the ocean of velvet stretches infinitely, its surface rippling with constellations that shift and rearrange into new stories every time I blink. A voice, both youthful and ancient, calls out—a paradoxical blend of my grandmother’s lilt and a child’s curiosity. It whispers of two paths ahead, each leading to a realm of its own. One path is lined with glowing mushrooms that pulse with the rhythm of my heartbeat, promising immediate warmth and the taste of gingerbread baked under a crescent moon. The other path is steeped in shadows, alive with whispering willows that invite me deeper into the unknown, hinting at a treasure buried beneath layers of time, guarded by riddles only the patient can solve.\n

The dream is asking me to choose between the safety of what’s certain and the promise of what’s uncertain. The mushrooms laugh like wind chimes, their scent of cinnamon and danger inviting me to linger. The willows, however, groan with the weight of centuries, their leaves rattling secret promises. I feel the pull of both—the immediate comfort of the familiar and the thrilling ache of delayed gratification. But as I stand at the crossroads, a question forms in my mind: What does it truly cost to chase a dream that is decades away?\n

The stars turn their attention downward, and one detaches itself, spiraling down to hover just above my palm. It speaks in a language of light and shadow, a riddle shaped by fire: “To understand the weight of time, you must balance the scales between the moth and the mountain. Which would you rather be?” 

The dream deepens.
