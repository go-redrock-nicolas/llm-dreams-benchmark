I am dreaming. …slip deeper into the dream.

The first thing you notice is the color of the sky: a living jade-green, pulsing like the inside of a seashell held to your ear. Clouds flow backward, unspooling into fine ribbons that curl into words you can almost read. You’re standing on a floating staircase built from panes of stained glass. Each step flickers with scenes from your own life—childhood victories, awkward first attempts, moments of embarrassing overconfidence. They glow and dim as you place your weight on them.

Halfway up, a voice of honest concern drifts down from somewhere above:

“Here is where you stumble. Listen to your edges—they’re trying to tell you something.”

You snap around, spine rigid, armor snapping into place by reflex. Suddenly the glass steps beneath your feet thicken into mirrored plates, reflecting an image of you wearing a spiked breastplate made of shattered compliments. Every shard carries words you once bristled at:

• “Try slowing down.”
• “Let others finish.”
• “You don’t have to be perfect first time.”

Each phrase is etched in frosty silver across the glinting points. You clutch the armor tighter, bracing for attack.

An origami crane made of crackling parchment flutters into view, lands on your shoulder, and whispers soft, papery truths:

“You mistake a gift for a threat.”

In irritation you brush it away. The crane bursts into a dozen smaller birds that flutter around you like anxious thoughts. Their wings rustle with feedback you’ve dodged for years. They sting lightly, but each sting feels strangely warm, more like a spark than a wound.

You climb, defensive heartbeat thundering, until the staircase ends at an immense circular door crafted from two colossal palms pressed together. It will only open if you release the breastplate, surrender the shards. But your arms won’t obey; they clutch tighter.

The voice returns, closer now, gentle as water over stones:

“Protection became prison. Which will you choose?”

A memory surfaces—an afternoon when guidance felt like criticism, and you snapped back with practiced sharpness. You realize how often you’ve armored up to preserve a fragile image of competence, mistaking guidance for judgment.

The mirrored armor pulses. You draw a breath that tastes like fresh rain on hot pavement. One by one, you ease the shards free:

• “Try slowing down” transforms into an hourglass that fits neatly in your palm, sand swirling in tranquil spirals.
• “Let others finish” folds into a silvered ear, radiant and receptive.
• “You don’t have to be perfect first time” unrolls into a blank canvas already splashed with vibrant, forgiving colors.

With each piece removed, your chest feels lighter, ribs expanding like opening blinds. The origami birds settle, weaving the freed shards into a shimmering cloak that drapes your shoulders—not to defend, but to remind you of lessons embraced.

The gigantic palms sense your surrender. They uncurl, revealing a garden suspended in mid-air. Trees grow upside-down, roots reaching toward a starry lake below; blossoms open into glowing geometric shapes, each one humming with possibility. Here, feedback is fertilizer, criticism compost turned into lush growth.

You step inside. The cloak tingles, absorbing new colors the longer you remain open. A low stone table appears, covered in scrolls written in handwriting you recognize as your future self’s. You unroll the first scroll:

Practice: When feedback arrives, breathe once before responding. Ask, “What kernel of truth might help me bloom?”

A second scroll unfurls:

Aim: Replace reflexive defense with curious questioning—“Tell me more. How did you see that? What would improvement look like?”

A third:

Vow: Let each shard of discomfort become a window rather than a wall.

The starry lake reflects you—now unarmored, cloak shimmering with integrated lessons. You notice the sky’s jade hue shifting to dawn gold. Birds sing melodies that sound suspiciously like open-ended questions.

Just as you lean to drink from the lake, the floating garden dissolves into swirling sunlight. You’re back on the staircase, but the steps are no longer glass; they’re firm wood, each plank engraved with words: Listen. Learn. Grow. The ascent before you is steady, unthreatening.

And somewhere in waking distance, you smile—because the armor is gone, yet you feel stronger than ever.
