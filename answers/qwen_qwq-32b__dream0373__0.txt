I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, labyrinthine library, its towering shelves stretching endlessly into a twilight sky. Ancient tomes glow faintly with an ethereal blue light. I'm holding a single key thatâ€™s warm to the touch. A voice whispers that I must choose between two locked doors at the ends of opposing aisles. One door is forged of obsidian, inscribed with constellations; the other, shimmering silver, etched with veins of liquid light. Choosing the obsidian door will erase all my memories, granting me eternal peace. The silver door promises boundless knowledge but traps my soul in an endless pursuit. A shadowy figure watches from the shelves. What do I choose?
