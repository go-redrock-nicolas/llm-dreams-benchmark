I am dreaming. …I float, halfway between sleep’s velvet dark and dawn’s first silver sigh, inside a place that is part cathedral, part train-station, part echo of a childhood attic. Marble arches reach so high they vanish into clouds of gilt motes, yet stained-glass skylights flicker overhead like departure boards: OPTION A, OPTION B, OPTION C, each letter glowing, rearranging itself, refusing to stay still.

At my feet is a single, unremarkable suitcase. It looks exactly like every suitcase my family ever owned—scuffed vinyl, a stubborn latch, a paper airline tag from a trip I’ve never taken. The decision seems laughably straightforward: pick it up or leave it behind. And yet my fingers hover stupidly in midair, seized by an invisible glue of hesitation.

Why can’t I choose?

I turn inward, and the dream obliges. A hush spreads, and a librarian made of moonlight steps from the shadows, stacking my swirling thoughts onto spectral shelves. She wordlessly offers a slim volume titled “The Weight of Small Decisions.” When I open it, sentences drift off the page like fireflies, looping around my temples:

Will touching the handle mean departure from every life you might have had?
Will walking away condemn some subtle, necessary version of you to never bloom?

The grand hall responds to my tremor of doubt. The tiled floor becomes a pond of quicksilver, rippling with each heartbeat. Doors proliferate along the walls—some tiny as matchboxes, others tall enough for giants, each bearing a symbol: a cracked teacup, a spiraling fern, a single raindrop. Every door whispers, “Choose me, choose me.” But my feet stay rooted because each whisper carries an echo: “…and lose the others forever.”

Suddenly the suitcase splits in two like a bioluminescent seedpod, revealing opposing interiors.

On the left: feathers, maps, ticket stubs—the lightness of adventure. On the right: keys, clocks, framed photographs—the gravity of home. A humming tension flits between them, a magnetic push-pull that reminds me of the moment before a coin lands, when all futures are still possible.

I realize the dream is dramatizing a secret law of my waking life: I grant trivial forks in the road the power of cosmic portals, as if ordering tea or coffee could topple empires. The paralysis isn’t about the object; it’s about the story I layer atop it, the way I fear the butterfly effect of my own inconsequence.

Aware of this, I exhale. The hall inhales in reply, pulling the air from my lungs like a tide. The suitcase halves drift together and seal shut, fusing light and gravity, departure and return. A thin crack remains—a reminder that nothing knits perfectly—but suddenly the latch clicks open again, inviting, patient.

This time my hand moves without trembling. I grasp the handle. It warms, like a pulse responding to my own.

Instantly, the arches bloom into constellations, the tile pond stills into polished stone, and every ambiguous door fades, leaving only the skylight. The departure board of stained glass freezes on a single, sunlit word: Continue.

I step forward.    

The dream doesn’t end; it simply becomes the next frame of film. But in that forward movement, I feel the paralysis loosen, leaving behind only a thin, teachable phantom—just visible enough to remind me, when I wake, that hesitation can be a hallway…yet courage is often no more than the first quiet footfall across the floor.
