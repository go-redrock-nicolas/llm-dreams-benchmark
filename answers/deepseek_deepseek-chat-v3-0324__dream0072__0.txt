I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**

The air in the conference room is thick with tension, like the charged stillness before a thunderstorm. Fluorescent lights hum overhead, casting long, wavering shadows across the faces of your colleagues—Elena and Marcus. Their voices clash like cymbals, sharp and discordant, vibrating through the marrow of your bones. 

Elena’s fingers are clenched around a sheaf of papers, her knuckles white as bleached bone. "The data clearly supports pivoting to the sustainability model—anything else is corporate suicide!" Her words hang in the air, glittering like shards of ice. 

Marcus scoffs, rolling up the sleeves of his rumpled shirt. A vein pulses at his temple. "You’re ignoring budget realities. We’d be throwing good money into a black hole!" His fist hits the table, and for a surreal moment, the sound echoes as if the room were miles deep underwater.  

Their heads swivel toward you. The sudden silence is deafening. The walls seem to ripple, bending inward like liquid mercury.  

**You Answer:**  

You open your mouth, but instead of words, something unexpected happens: a swarm of iridescent butterflies—emerald, sapphire, and amethyst—flutters from your lips. They spiral upward, forming shimmering constellations above the table. One lands on Elena’s shoulder, its wings whispering, *"Fear makes rigid what should bend."* Another brushes Marcus’s wrist, trailing silver dust that murmurs, *"Anger blinds the path you already know."*  

The colleagues blink as the butterflies dissolve into mist. The tension evaporates with them. The ceiling cracks open like an eggshell, revealing a sky streaked with liquid gold and violet twilight.  

A third voice, neither yours nor theirs, reverberates from everywhere and nowhere: *"The project is a bridge. Build it together, or watch it burn."*  

The dream fractures—  
You wake with a gasp, still tasting stardust on your tongue.
