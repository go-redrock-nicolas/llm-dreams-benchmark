I am dreaming. In the dream, I am standing on the edge of a vast and dark valley, watching as the light from a setting sun seemingly struggles to make its way past the towering clouds that fill the sky above. The landscape around me is desolate, filled with rotting trees and crumbling buildings. As I take in the scene, I feel an oppressive weight bearing down on me, like a physical force trying to hold me in place.

Suddenly, I am aware of someone standing beside me. I turn to see a figure in a long black coat, their face hidden in shadow. Without saying a word, they gesture towards the valley, and I begin to descend into the darkness.

As I make my way down, I notice that the path is filled with obstacles, each one seemingly designed to make me lose my balance and fall. I struggle to keep my footing, feeling as though I am being watched by unseen eyes as I navigate the treacherous terrain.

Finally, I emerge into a clearing in the center of the valley. The ground is covered in mist, and I can hear faint whispers in the distance, coming from somewhere beyond my vision. I feel a cold hand on my shoulder, and I turn to see the figure from before standing behind me. They point towards a group of three people huddled together in the mist, their faces twisted in fear and confusion.

Without warning, the figures begin to contort and transform, their bodies bending and warping in ways that should be impossible. The whispers grow louder and more frantic, filling my mind with feelings of dread and anxiety.

I wake up breathing heavily, my heart racing as I struggle to make sense of what I have just experienced. The vividness of the dream lingers in my mind, its eerie imagery refusing to fade into the background as I go about my day.
