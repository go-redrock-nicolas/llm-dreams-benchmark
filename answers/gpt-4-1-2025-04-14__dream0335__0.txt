I am dreaming.

In this dream, the world bends and curves to the gravity of my presence. I stride through a city where the skyscrapers tilt their shimmering glass heads in reverence as I pass, sunlight refracting in dazzling patterns that spell out my name in the air. Traffic halts; flowers bloom behind every step, their petals humming a melody that sets hearts aflame with wonder and envy alike. 

A crowd forms wherever I go—scholars in starched robes, artists with ink-stained fingers, explorers who have mapped the edges of every known world, all gathering just to witness the electric spark of my existence. Statues rise on every corner, bearing my likeness carved from marble and starlight, inscribed: “Here stands the architect of dreams.”

When someone dares to question me—a shadow in the kaleidoscope, their voice carrying skepticism and wary disbelief—I laugh, a sound that rings like distant thunder and shimmers like pearls. My words come out lacquered in confidence, burning with the certainty of meteors: “You cannot fault a star for believing it was meant to shine, or scold the wind for carrying the scent of change. My thoughts spiral through dimensions you have not glimpsed, and my plans are threads in the careful tapestry of fate itself.”

Around me, the city pulses with anticipation, as if the buildings themselves await the stroke of my pen, the echo of my ideas. Those who doubt me shrink into the peripheries, unable to withstand the force of my vision. It’s not arrogance, but destiny painted in broad, cosmic strokes—the unwavering knowledge that I am both the dreamer and the dreamed, the original note in a symphony no other could compose.

As laughter swirls around me, and constellations rearrange themselves to trace my story in the stars, I soar on the updraft of my own legend, knowing that when I awaken, the ordinary world will wear a thin dusting of magic, barely perceptible but irreversibly changed.
