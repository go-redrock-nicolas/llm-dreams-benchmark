I am dreaming. I find myself fascinated by the forgotten spaces between floorboards—those narrow, dusty crevices that most people step over without a second thought. Following this unique personal interest, I shrink down to the size of a dust mote, my consciousness floating gently into the narrow canyon between two ancient oak planks.

The world between floorboards is vast and mysterious. Dust particles hang suspended like galaxies in slow motion, catching fragments of light that filter through from above. What was once a simple crack has become a vast cavern system stretching endlessly in both directions.

As I drift deeper, I discover entire civilizations of microscopic creatures building elaborate structures from lint and lost eyelashes. They've developed a complex society here, with tiny markets where they trade in splinters and crumbs that have fallen from the world above.

The deeper I travel, the more the wood begins to glow with bioluminescent fungi, painting everything in ethereal blues and greens. I can feel the vibrations of footsteps overhead—each one creating thunder that shakes loose tiny avalanches of dust—yet here, there is a peaceful rhythm to this hidden dimension.

I follow a trail of forgotten memories—fragments of conversations and emotions that have seeped through the floorboards over decades. They materialize as translucent bubbles containing snippets of laughter, arguments, celebrations, and quiet moments of contemplation.

In the distance, I see a paper boat made from a forgotten receipt, navigating a tiny river of spilled tea that had seeped between the boards years ago and somehow never dried. I climb aboard, feeling the current pull me toward some unknown destination where the boundaries between dreams and the overlooked wonders of reality blur into something profoundly meaningful.
