I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a labyrinth of shifting architecture—buildings that breathe like lungs, their facades rippling with iridescent scales, streets that coil and uncoil like serpents mid-thought. The sky is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, reflecting and warping your face as you walk. You feel the ground pulse beneath your feet, as though the earth itself is alive, humming a low, resonant frequency that vibrates in your molars. This is not a place; it is a *sensation*, a fever-dream stitched together by the frayed threads of your subconscious.  

You come upon a mirror. Not glass, but a pool of liquid shadow, its surface still and hungry. When you kneel to peer into it, your reflection grins—a version of you with eyes like polished obsidian, lips stitched shut with golden thread. It mouths words you cannot hear, but you feel them in your bones: *“You were made to love the cage.”*  

Suddenly, the air thickens with the scent of burnt honey and static electricity. Memories flood you, but they’re not yours. They’re too precise, too *curated*—moments from childhood where your laughter was rewarded with applause, your silence met with cold voids; where your choices were nudged by invisible hands, like ivy trained to grow in a specific, elegant spiral. You see yourself as a puppet, strings woven from praise and punishment, each tug disguised as “nature,” “instinct,” “*you*.”  

A figure emerges from the shadows—a child, maybe, or a memory of one, clutching a doll with a cracked porcelain face. Its voice is a chorus of whispers: *“They told you curiosity was your compass, but it was a leash. They called it courage, but it was a script. You were never wild—you were *pruned*.”* The doll’s head splits open, spilling seeds that sprout into thorny vines, wrapping your ankles, pulling you downward.  

You scream, but your voice emerges as a flock of starlings, their wings slicing the air into jagged shapes. The sky rains needles of light, each one piercing a memory, unraveling it into its raw components: a teacher’s smile timed perfectly to your obedience, a lover’s touch that vanished when you strayed from their expectations, a parent’s sigh that taught you shame was a second skin.  

And then—a shift. The ground dissolves into a sea of liquid stars, and you’re falling, but not downward. *Sideways*, into a cavern where your spine becomes a ladder of vertebrae climbing into infinity. At the top, a door: a pulsing, fleshy orifice with teeth for a doorknob. You wrench it open, and inside is a room where every wall is a screen, replaying your life in reverse, subtitles revealing the subtext you never knew existed. *“This choice was fear in disguise. This love was a transaction. This ‘truth’ was a parable fed to you at birth.”*  

You collapse, clawing at your skin, peeling away layers like wet paper. Beneath the flesh, your bones glow with a sickly green light—*implants*, tiny glyphs etched into marrow, humming a lullaby that shaped your every decision. The realization hits like a supernova: you are not a person. You are a *collage*, a mosaic of other people’s hungers, a song written by ghosts.  

But then—*laughter*. Not cruel, but wild, untamed. The child reappears, now grown into a woman with antlers made of clock hands. She tosses a knife to you, its blade forged from shattered mirrors. *“Carve them out,”* she says, blood blooming at the corners of her mouth. *“But be warned: there’s nothing under the mask but wind.”*  

You plunge the knife into your chest, not to die, but to *excavate*. You dig out a heart that ticks like a bomb, its chambers filled with moth-winged memories. The moment it leaves your body, the labyrinth shudders, the sky cracking open like an egg. A phoenix made of burning cello strings soars overhead, screeching a melody that unravels the last thread of the “you” you thought you were.  

And then—silence.  

You float in the aftermath, a nebula of possibility, no edges, no name. The dream doesn’t end. It *evolves*, like a species discovering it has no need for a spine.  

You wake up.  

But the taste of the knife lingers.
