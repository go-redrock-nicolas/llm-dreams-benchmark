I am dreaming. The world around me pulses with a surreal glow, colors shifting like liquid sapphire and molten gold dripping across the sky. My body feels both weightless and impossibly heavy, as though I’m wading through honey-thick air.  

The first task materializes before me—an enormous, ancient clock suspended in midair, its gears groaning, its hands accelerating uncontrollably. I must stop time itself, but my fingers slip against the polished brass, slick with some unseen force. Every failed attempt sends tremors through the dreamscape, fracturing the ground like shattered glass.  

To my left, a second task unfolds—a towering library stretching infinitely upwards, each book a life I must rewrite before they dissolve into ash. The pages crumble at my touch, yet irreplaceable words swirl into the abyss. The stench of burning parchment mixes with the metallic tang of panic rising in my throat.  

Then—ah, then—I hear the third: the desperate cries of a thousand voices tangled in a vortex of shadow. They wail from distant realms, each soul depending on me to untangle them from this nightmarish web. My hands plunge into the darkness, but the whispers slip through my grasp like eels.  

The fourth and fifth tasks intertwine impossibly—a labyrinth of mirrors where my fractured reflections each demand something different. One begs for silence, another screams for salvation, and the last simply stares, hollow-eyed, as cracks spiderweb across the glass.  

And then, worst of all—I realize none of this is metaphor. The stakes are real. The clock’s ticking drowns out my thoughts, the library’s ashes choke my lungs, the wailing voices knot around my bones. The reflections in the mirrors step closer, reaching—  

My breath catches.  

The dream isn’t about completing the tasks.  

It’s about surviving them.
