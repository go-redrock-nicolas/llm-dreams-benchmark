I am dreaming. find myself standing at the edge of a city made entirely of glass. The night wind howls through shimmering towers, each pane reflecting a dozen shattered versions of myself—faces streaked with confusion and defeat. The map in my hand, once meticulous and filled with hope, is now sodden, the ink bled into unintelligible shapes that resemble the labyrinth of my thoughts.

At first, I sink onto a bench of sculpted crystal, the seat cool and unyielding beneath me. All the routes I had charted ahead—my grand plans, aspirations, the carefully stitched tapestry of my future—seem to evaporate into the mist that creeps along the glinting streets. The glass underfoot cracks ominously, and my heart stutters to match its fractured rhythm.

But slowly, as my breathing finds a new steadiness, I begin to notice the world around me tuning itself to survival. Soft music emerges: the wind plays gentle chords through the hollow rails of a nearby bridge, and rain taps out an unfamiliar but hopeful melody on the rooftops above. I raise my head and notice, in the distance, a garden blossoming amidst the broken shards—a riot of impossible flowers blooming through cracks, petals shaped like tiny lanterns pulsating with warm golden light.

Compelled by a curiosity I thought I had lost, I stand and take a tentative step forward. My reflection in the mirror-like sidewalks wavers, transforming into a figure that is at once me and yet somehow braver, eyes alight with possibility. I realize, with the startling clarity that only dreams provide, that the setback—the great derailment—is not the end of my journey, but a portal to realms I had never dared to imagine.

The ordeal, in its devastation, has cracked open new passageways. I walk on, feet dusted with luminous pollen, each step echoing with the promise of discovery. The city, once foreboding, becomes a playground of refracted light and potential. Doors swing open where none existed before. The map, discarded in a puddle behind me, is no longer needed.

The ache of loss lingers, but it is braided now with wonder, and as dawn breaks across the glittering skyline, I find myself ready to explore every unfamiliar avenue the dream-world has unfolded before me.
