I am dreaming.

You are standing on a beach, the waves crashing at your feet. The sun is setting in the distance, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. The sand beneath your feet feels warm and soft, and the salty breeze tousles your hair.

You turn to face your close friend, who looks at you with a mixture of confusion and frustration. They are dressed in their favorite pair of jeans and a t-shirt, with a look of determination on their face.

"I don't understand why you can't see things from my perspective," they say, their voice breaking a little. "We've been friends for so long, and this issue is so important to me."

You take a deep breath and look out at the sea, trying to gather your thoughts. You know this argument is important, and you want to find a way to resolve it.

"I understand how you feel," you begin, "but I don't think you're looking at the situation from my point of view. We both have different experiences and values, and that's okay. We just need to find a way to meet in the middle."

Your friend nods, but you can tell they are still upset. You reach out to touch their hand, and they look at you with teary eyes.

"We're in this together, okay? We'll find a solution, I promise."

They nod again and give you a small smile. You turn back to the sea, feeling a sense of peace wash over you. The sun is almost completely set now, and the sky has turned a deep purple.

Suddenly, you feel a hand on your shoulder. You turn around to see your friend smiling at you, and you realize that you're no longer on the beach. You're back in your room, standing in front of them.

"I'm glad we figured that out," they say. "Thanks for sticking with me."

You grin back at them, feeling a warm sense of love and friendship. "Of course, I'd never leave your side. We're stronger together, after all."

You hug them tightly, and as you do, you feel a sense of calm and contentment wash over you. You know that everything will be okay, as long as you're with the people you love.

And just like that, you wake up.
