I am dreaming. Odd shapes emerge through the fog.  I am at the edge of a dense forest that borders the sea.  There is salt in the air and as it mixes with the fallen pine needles, you get a scent that is crisp and fresh but reminds you of dark green.  On the beach stand two leaders whose conflict threatens to tear apart their fragile truce.

On the left is Erik Bloodaxe, a fierce Viking warrior with piercing blue eyes and long blond hair that flows like a golden river to his muscular shoulders. Clad in a heavy bear fur cloak adorned with intricate silver markings, he brandishes a double-headed battle-axe with a ruby encrusted handle, reflecting the blazing bonfires surrounding the beach.

On the right stands Miyamoto Musashi, the legendary Japanese swordsman clad in a dark blue kimono with a mesmerizing pattern of silver dragons. His eyes, dark as obsidian, exude the intensity and wisdom from a lifetime of duels. He holds a beautifully crafted katana with both hands, the blade gleaming under the moonlight. A subtle yet resolute determination fills the air around him.


The tension of their combined presence electrifies the scene like a brewing storm.  Behind each leader stands a group of formidable warriors from their respective clans.  Erik's men, raucous and boisterous, bear heavy iron shields and speak boldly of the coming battle.   Miyamoto's men, calm and poised, speak softly among themselves while the wind gently rustles their banners.

As I stand, sand beneath my feet, I realize that these great men want my help.  I too have a choice to make.  Two paths lay open before me where I could lend my strength and skills, two futures that will be determined by my actions. 

For now, it all hangs in the balance while the waves lap against the shore and the night birds call out from the safety of the woods.  Faster now, my heart pounds as the gravity of the situation settles upon me like the fog rolling in.  Will I choose a side or find a way to bring these bitter foes together?  Only time will tell, but I can not afford to wait much longer... the fate of this world lies in my hands.
