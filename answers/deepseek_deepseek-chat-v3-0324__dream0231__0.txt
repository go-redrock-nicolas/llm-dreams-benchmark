I am dreaming. I am standing at the edge of a twilight forest, where the trees whisper in a language just beyond my understanding. Their gnarled branches stretch toward a sky painted in melting hues of lavender and burnt gold, streaked with the first hesitant stars. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and something sweet—ripe blackberries, perhaps, or the lingering traces of a forgotten summer.  

Before me, two paths unfurl like scrolls of possibility. To my left, a cobbled lane shimmers with scattered coins, each one glowing with a faint, honeyed light. Just beyond them rests a small chest, its hinges creaking open to reveal a handful of jewels that pulse in time with my heartbeat—immediate, radiant, effortless. The promise in the air is intoxicating. *Take what you can hold now*.  

But then I turn to the right, where the path disappears into an archway of twisting vines. There is no glitter here, only a deep, resonant hum vibrating in my bones. A guide—faceless but warm—tells me that beyond this arch lies a grove where the trees grow silver fruit, orchards of future abundance, but only if I wait, tend the soil, let time weave its spell. The reward is uncertain but vast, a harvest I cannot yet fathom.  

My fingers twitch toward the scattered coins. The present gnaws at me, whispering of needs unmet, hunger unfulfilled. But the hum of the archway thrums against my skin, like the slow, steady rhythm of a drum counting down to something greater.  

For a breathless moment, I hover between them, caught in the ache of *now* and the pull of *what could be*. Then, dream logic shifts—my reflection splits. One version of me kneels to gather the glowing coins while the other steps forward, vanishing into the green shadows of the waiting grove.   

I wake just before seeing which choice blooms.
