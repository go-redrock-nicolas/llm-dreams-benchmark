I am dreaming. Suddenly, the world around me blurs into a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, the edges of my vision dancing with the same electric energy that courses through me. The air feels charged, every molecule vibrating with anticipation, like the pause before a thunderclap. I'm standing in my childhood home, but it's... different. The walls breathe with a life of their own, their painted patterns writhing like constellations in the evening sky. The clock in the hallway ticks with the slow, steady pulse of a lighthouse beacon, counting down the seconds to some unknown, but clearly significant, event.

The telltale creaking of the kitchen floor announces the arrival of my grandmother. She floats in, her customary smile replaced by an expression of gravity. Her eyes, deep pools of wisdom and warmth, are liquid with unshed tears. She's holding a letter, the cream paper stark against her weathered, papery hands. The seal bears the insignia of a nonexistent royalty, a dragon rampant, the heraldic beast's eyes ablaze with emerald fire.

She extends the letter towards me, the motion slow and deliberate, like a priest offering communion. I reach out, by reflex more than decision, and as my fingers brush the parchment, a jolt shoots up my arm, akin to biting into a lemon's skin. I look at the letter, my name scrawled across the front in a handwriting I do not recognize. It's elegant, a flourish of calligraphy that seems to dance and shift under my gaze, ink turning to stardust.

My heart pounds in my chest, a relentless drumbeat of anticipation and dread. The room holds its breath, waiting. I tear open the seal, releasing a gust of ink and paper scent that I swear is imbued with the aroma of distant seas and ancient forests. The ink of the words swirls like galaxies, each line a system of stars, each character a zenith.

As I read, the letters seem to leap off the page, each one a tiny comet, trailing stardust. The words are few, each one a hammer blow to my soul.

"*You are the last of the Stellara Line,*" it reads, "*the final heritage of a throne lost to time. A great power lies dormant within you, a power that can save our realm or doom it. The quest to unlock it begins now.*"

The letter buzzes in my hand, the paper disintegrating into motes of light that swirl around me, painting constellations on the air. The once-familiar room blurs again, the world tilting like a top, and I'm spinning, falling into the gaping maw of a storm. Lightning forks around me, illuminating the faces of people I know, strangers, mythical beasts, all encoded in the clouds. Thunder roars, a challenge, a promise, a question. The storm demands an answer, but all I can do is scream, "Who am I?" as the lightning strikes.
