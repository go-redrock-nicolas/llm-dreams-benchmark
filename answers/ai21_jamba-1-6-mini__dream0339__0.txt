I am dreaming. Suddenly, you realize you’re walking through an ancient forest, the kind you’ve only read about in books of myths and legends. The trees here are enormous, their trunks as wide as houses, and their intertwining branches form a canopy so dense that it blocks out the sun, leaving the forest in a luminous, otherworldly twilight. 

As you walk, you notice that the air is filled with a soft, ethereal music. At first, it’s barely perceptible—a faint, haunting melody that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. But as you move deeper into the forest, the music grows clearer, more distinct. You pause, entranced, and listen closely, trying to identify the source.

Suddenly, you see them—tiny, glowing creatures flitting through the air, their bodies shimmering like tiny stars. They’re singing in a language you can’t comprehend, but their voices are so pure, so achingly beautiful, that it feels as though your heart might burst from the sheer wonder of it. You watch in rapt awe as they dart and dance, their movements perfectly synchronized with the music, creating a performance that feels both wildly free and intricately choreographed.

You are joy, unbound and unfiltered.

And for a moment—just one tiny, precious moment—you are inexplicably, irrevocably, wonderfully happy.
