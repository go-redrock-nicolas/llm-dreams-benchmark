I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, intricate labyrinth made of obsidian. The walls are smooth and black, reflecting the faint glow of bioluminescent mushrooms that grow in clusters along the paths. Above me is a starless sky, but a silver river flows through the center of the maze, its surface rippling with constellations that shift and change like living creatures. I am fixated on a perceived slight from someone important to you—not a mortal slight, but a celestial slight. The stars in the river have formed a constellation that resembles a person's face, but one of the stars is dimmer, a shadow compared to the others. This dimming star is the slight, causing a ripple effect in the silver river. The water begins to swirl around me, pulling me into its depths. As I sink, the river transforms into a living tapestry of memories and emotions—the dim star’s light ignites into a thousand sparks, each a memory of moments shared with that celestial being. My rumination manifests as water pressure, crushing me. But with each breath held, the pressure lessens, replaced by buoyancy. I surface on a shore lined with iridescent sand, the river now calm. The dim star has been reignited, its constellation whole again. The labyrinth walls crumble, and I wake up not in bed, but on a beach at dawn, the real sun rising over the horizon, matching the cerulean glow of the dream.
