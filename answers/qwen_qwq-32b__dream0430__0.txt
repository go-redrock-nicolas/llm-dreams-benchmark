I am dreaming. I stand amidst a labyrinth of colossal, semi-transparent jellyfish floating in a midnight-blue sky. Each one pulses with bioluminescent hues—bursts of cerulean, emerald, and violet—fading into gradients that shimmer like oil on water. The air smells like petrichor and wild jasmine. Below, an ocean of liquid mercury swirls, reflecting the surreal canopy above into a silvery tapestry. I feel an acute tenderness for this fleeting marvel, so exquisite yet so ephemeral. Others nearby wander obliviously, eyes fixed on glowing orbs that hover at their feet, their attention tethered to screens of their own making.\n

My fingers graze the edge of a pulsing jellyfish, and where we touch, a thousand delicate threads of light bloom outward, cascading like fireflies caught in a snowstorm. The sound is a resonant hum, resonant with harmonies reminiscent of a pipe organ played by the sea itself. I follow the trail of light, it is almost as if the dreamispers a secret. The path leads me to an archipelago of levitating rock formations, their surfaces etched with glowing runes in a language I intuitively comprehend—stories of forgotten celestial collisions and the birth of tectonic symphonies. Time here is not a line but a spiral, looping through eras where dinosaurs danced under twin moons and future cities crumble into iridescent moss.\n

A voice, both internal and external, murmurs, *“The world is a palimpsest; beauty is written in hidden strokes.”* I realize the jellyfish are not creatures but living lexicons, their light a lexicon of memories the universe refuses to lose. As dawn’s first tentative gold threads pierce the indigo horizon, the scene unravels like a scroll. I awake, clutching a single iridescent thread from the jellyfish’s tentacle, which glimmers faintly in my palm, a silent testament to truths meant to be felt, not seen.\n
