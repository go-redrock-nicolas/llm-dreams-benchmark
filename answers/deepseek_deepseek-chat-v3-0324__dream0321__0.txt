I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Edge of Falling**  

I am dreaming.  

The invitation arrives not on paper, but as a ripple through the very air—a whisper that hums against my skin, carving words into my pulse. *"Come to the place where the sky fractures. Step into the unspeakable."*  

I find myself at the precipice of *something vast*, though I don’t remember traveling here. The world is split—behind me, a landscape of liquid shadow, shifting like ink in water. Before me? Nothing. A sheer, endless drop into an abyss that swallows sound. Yet... it isn’t empty. No. It’s *alive*. Deep in that void, glimmers move—bioluminescent swirls, like submerged stars—and something about them *pulls* at me, a hunger in my marrow begging me to leap.  

A guide stands beside me—or is it part of the dream itself? Faceless, but radiating reassurance and menace in equal measure. *"The fall won’t kill you. But you won’t be the same after you rise."*  

I step forward. The tension is unbearable, electric. My body trembles, screaming *danger*, but the void *sings*, a chord resonating in my teeth.  

Then—  
I’m falling.  

Not plummeting, but *unraveling*. The wind doesn’t howl; it *laughs*, a chorus of voices I almost recognize. My skin prickles with static as the darkness presses in, but the glowing shapes surge closer, forming hands, faces—echoes of people I’ve known, or will know. They brush against me, and everywhere they touch, memories erupt—not mine. A woman’s last breath in a war I never fought. A child’s joy on a planet with two suns. A love I never lived.  

*I am dissolving.*  

Just as panic claws up my throat, the fall *changes*. I’m not descending—I’m *expanding*, fractaling outward like ink in water, my edges blending into the dark. The fear is still there, but it’s giddy now, euphoric. *This* is the thrill, the terror: not the fall, but the surrender.  

The guide’s voice lingers, distant but clear—  
*"Now you know what it means to be endless."*  

Then—  
I wake.  

(Sweat-drenched. Heart wild. Smiling.)
