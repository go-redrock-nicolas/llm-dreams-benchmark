I am dreaming. you may have to make some sacrifices or compromises.

Maybe it doesn't matter how much money you save if you never get to see the person you love again. Maybe it doesn't matter how healthy you are if you don't feel happy inside.

Maybe happiness is worth more than everything else combined.
