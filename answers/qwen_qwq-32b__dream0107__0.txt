I am dreaming. I am the judge. The courtroom is a vast, swirling vortex of time and space, with stained glass windows depicting scenes from the beginning of the universe to its eventual end. The are floating islands, each clinging to relics of their respective epochs. The is a clockwork golem, its gears speaking in a chorus of ten thousand simultaneous voices, each voice a different human language. The is a nebula-woman, her form shifting between gas and starlight, her words carried on solar winds. The represent two irreconcilable truths: Progress and Memory. golem argues that stasis leads to decay; the nebula whispers that recklessness erases legacy. My gavel is a meteorite that hums with the weight of forgotten supernovas.
