I am dreaming. I am in a world where my wishes come true immediately.  I can fly without wings.  I can run faster than lightning.  I can change the color of objects just by thinking about it.  I can create new life forms out of thin air. 
I see a beautiful city ahead of me.  It is full of shining buildings, colorful gardens, and happy people.  There are no traffic jams, no pollution, no crime.  Everyone loves everyone else unconditionally.  
I feel a strong pull towards this city.  Like I need it more than anything else in the universe.  Like it calls me home.   
As I approach the city, I hear music playing from somewhere far away.  It sounds like angels singing.  I follow the sound until I find its source: a group of dancing fairies who are spreading joy and love throughout the land with their magical songs.  
I join them in their dance and soon we are all floating in midair together, twirling around each other like cotton candy clouds.  We laugh, we cry, we hug each other tightly until our bones crackle
