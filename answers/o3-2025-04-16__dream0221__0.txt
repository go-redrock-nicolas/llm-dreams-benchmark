I am dreaming. …step forward as though propelled by a soft, invisible tide. The scene around you rearranges itself with the pliancy of a thought: the tiled floor of your bedroom peels away like paper, unfurling into a colossus of wind-swept marble steps that ascend toward a sky the color of moon-lit ink. A thousand silver-throated bells ring from nowhere and everywhere at once, announcing your arrival to an assembly that seems carved from dreamstuff—scholars with hourglass beards, stargazers whose wide eyes glitter like constellations, and children with notebooks made of shifting watercolor.

Your newly discovered art? Gravity Weaving.

You had never so much as pondered the laws of physics beyond dropping a spoon, yet in the instant before waking you learned—no, remembered—how to gather gravity in shimmering strands and braid them into shapes, melodies, and entire philosophies made visible. 

A dais unfurls beneath your bare feet, its surface a living scroll that records each heartbeat in curlicues of luminous ink. Breath trembling with excitement, you lift your hands, and the very weight of existence answers. Invisible lines of gravitation—thin as spider silk, bright as the aurora—spool between your fingertips. With a flick of your wrist, you sculpt a sphere of gentle pull: a pocket world where feathers drift like pebbles and pebbles float like dream-fog. The audience gasps as their own shoes momentarily lighten, rules they’ve trusted all their lives unhooking like buttons.

You spin the sphere outward, unraveling it into a ribbon that twists above the crowd. Each twist blooms into impossible topologies: Möbius ladders that children climb laughing, Klein-bottle blossoms that open to reveal mirrored petals, hyperbolic funnels through which distant thunder can be heard grumbling like an old storyteller. Applause arrives as a warm breeze—actual wind conjured by the convective eddies of reconfigured gravity.

Suddenly, the Master of Ceremonies—a tall figure whose cloak is stitched from old maps—steps forward and issues the ultimate challenge: 

“We have all been burdened by one collective weight,” the Master intones, voice resonant. “Lift it, if you truly command gravitas.”

A hush falls. From beneath the amphitheater, you feel it: the immovable mass of doubt, grief, and history itself—a stone so heavy it anchors dreams to the thick mud of reluctance. Your heart stutters. This is no parlor trick.

You inhale, drawing the hush into your lungs. Memories rise inside you like lanterns: childhood afternoons when you tried to fly by jumping off tree stumps; evenings you sat in silence, believing you lacked all talent; the phantom weight of every unfinished hope. Instead of flinching, you reach for those remembrances, weaving them into your growing tapestry of gravitational threads. They glow—wounds turned to luminescence.

Then you press your palms to the air. A reverberation hums through your bones. Beneath the amphitheater, you feel the colossal boulder lurch, as though startled awake after eons. It rises—slow, groaning, but inexorable. Stone dust drifts upward like snowfall in reverse. The grandstands tremble, yet remain intact, weight redistributed through your living lattice of forces. The crowd stands transfixed, tears slipping free, unburdened.

For a single crystalline heartbeat the great stone hovers—gravity momentarily democratized, no heavier than a secret you are finally willing to speak aloud. You open your fingers, release the woven strands, and the boulder dissolves into a constellation of pebbles that ascend, becoming new stars in the sky of your dream.

Silence, then thunderous applause—an ovation that feels like sunlight breaking through storm clouds. The Master of Ceremonies bows so low that cartographers will later mark the spot: “You have lifted more than weight,” the Master whispers. “You have lifted belief.”

Lights dim. The amphitheater melts back into the smooth floorboards of your bedroom. Yet your fingertips still tingle; every molecule in your body remembers how easy it was to move the world when you believed nothing was immovable.

You wake with dawn spilling across the room, certain of two things:

1. Gravity Weaving does not exist—at least, not yet.  
2. The knowledge of how to do it thrums inside you like a newly tuned instrument, waiting for the next dream—or the next brave moment in waking life—when you’ll raise your hands and begin to weave again.
