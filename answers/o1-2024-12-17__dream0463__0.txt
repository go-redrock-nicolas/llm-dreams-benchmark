I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The scene around you shifts in swirling shades of dusky lavender and silver, as if a distant fog is tinted by starlight. In the air hangs the faint echo of a heartbeat—steady, persistent—pulsing just beyond the edge of your vision. You find yourself in a grand marble corridor that stretches endlessly in both directions, lit by candles suspended in midair. Their flames crackle with a soft hiss, revealing flecks of rainbow embers. 

As you walk down this corridor, you notice figures standing in small clusters to the left and right. They wear elegant robes embroidered with strange, cryptic symbols that glimmer gold in the candlelight. They speak in hushes and look at you with practiced indifference, their eyes skimming across you as though you were some curious object. Their subtle disapproval weighs on you like the coils of a giant serpent, tightening around your chest. You feel your heart quicken, hoping—longing—for the slightest indication that you matter, that they deem you worthy of acknowledgment. They do not offer it.

Again and again, you step toward them, your lips pressed into a tentative smile. But every time, as your hand extends, you see them whisper to each other, turning slightly away, leaving you on the outskirts of their conversation. Resentment and sadness bubble inside you, a deep ache of unrecognized effort. You feel it in your very bones, as though a thousand echoes remind you: This is the same pattern you have seen before. The pattern of trying again and again to win a nod of approval from the stony-faced guardians of acceptance.

Recognizing this painful loop, you stop in the middle of that endless corridor. The floor beneath you cracks in a web of glowing veins, pulsating like living lava. With each breath you draw, you sense that this is a decision point. The pressure of countless gazes still weighs heavily on your shoulders, but an ember of courage sparks within you—an alternative path unfurls in the distance.

Stepping away from the clusters of silent onlookers, you turn toward a set of towering double doors carved from ancient oak. Their surfaces are etched with elaborate vines and swirling constellations. With a shaky hand, you reach out, push them open, and step through into a vast, moonlit clearing.

A warm breeze caresses your face, carrying the scent of jasmine and night-blooming flowers. In the center of this clearing stands a kernel of light—a radiant orb, suspended in the air like a second moon. You draw nearer, curiosity and determination guiding your steps, though your heart flutters with anticipation. The approval you once sought from others seems to dissolve in the silent brilliance of this orb. 

When you touch it, you feel a surge of self-realization flowing into you—awareness that your own acceptance must begin within. It fills your chest with a gentle warmth, and you close your eyes in silent affirmation of your own worth. In the distance, the corridor disappears, and with it, the faces that have withheld their praise. 

Now, beneath the moonlight, you allow the orb’s glow to illuminate the depths of your self-doubt and hesitation. Like silken threads breaking free from a tangle, you sense the loosening of that old need for approval, replaced by an inner steadiness. As you breathe out, the orb drifts upward, scattering into countless shimmering fireflies. They spread throughout the forest clearing, lighting up the night in a constellation of self-assured sparks.

In this dream, you stand at peace with yourself. The breeze picks up, lifting the edges of your clothes in a dance of serenity. You can still feel, so faintly, the corridor of withheld approval behind you—but it has faded into near-nothingness, overshadowed by the pulsing lights of your own newfound radiance. You turn your gaze skyward, ready to awaken with this message etched into your heart: you are free to approve of yourself.
