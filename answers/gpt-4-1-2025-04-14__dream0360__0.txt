I am dreaming. —become untethered from the gray anchors of memory, floating instead into a landscape forged by possibility rather than pattern. Around me, the dream world shivers and reforms—a vast, kaleidoscopic garden where paths fork endlessly, each laid with stones inscribed with lessons half learned, half forgotten.

Above, the sky roils with color, pulsing with more hues than waking eyes could ever see. The air tastes like sweet rain. In the center of the garden, I stumble upon a reflecting pond. Its silvery surface doesn’t show my face, but shapeshifts into vignettes—laughter echoing down hallways long gone, arguments played out in silent pantomime, the heartbreaks and healings of every love that once seemed permanent. These scenes are familiar but distant, moving as if underwater.

I kneel at the shoreline, cupping the cool water in my hands, and whisper my intention into the ripples: “I release you.” With that, the pond glimmers, ripples growing until the surface distorts, dissolving the old images. Bracing myself, I look up.

Now—in this liminal space between sleeping and waking—I see the new relationship before me, unmarked by the baggage I used to haul. The person stands in a clearing, illuminated by light that feels gentle, not blinding. Their voice comes through clear and true, no longer muffled by echoes of the past. I step forward, my heart lighter, aware of the patterns but letting them spin away like autumn leaves, gold and red, no longer clinging tight.

In this dream, I am both witness and creator of a new story. The patterns of before no longer dictate the shapes I step into. The garden expands, lush and inviting, promising connections grounded in the luminous present—and I walk forward, awake even as I sleep, welcoming the unknown with open arms.
