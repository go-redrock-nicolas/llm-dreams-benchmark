I am dreaming. The air hums with a soft, silver glow—not quite light, not quite sound—as I step into the support network’s meeting space. It’s not a room but a vast, shifting expanse where thoughts take shape as colors, drifting like auroras. The ground is soft beneath my feet, an undulating fabric of emotions woven together—threads of sorrow, resilience, hope—waiting for someone to pick them up and mend what’s frayed.  

Then, a ripple in the air—a voice, or maybe a feeling, calling out in distress. A deep amber pulse throbs in the shared space between us, signaling pain. I reach out, not with my hands but with something deeper—*intention*—and the threads around me respond. The colors swirl, forming a bridge between us.  

I see them now—a silhouette woven from storm clouds and starlight, trembling like a candle flame in the wind. They don’t speak in words, but I *understand*: a crushing loneliness, a fear of breaking. Without hesitation, I let my own presence bloom around them like dawn breaking—gold and warmth spilling into the dark.  

Then, others in the network notice. One by one, their energies reach out—a melody of comfort, a steady rhythm of reassurance, a spark of shared laughter from better times. The storm-cloud silhouette shudders, and the gray begins to shimmer, threads of cobalt and silver weaving into them. They’re not alone anymore.  

The dream shifts, and the space becomes a garden, each of us a living root intertwined beneath the earth, drawing strength from one another. When one hurts, the others bend closer. When one grows, the whole network blossoms.  

And just as I feel the dream beginning to fade, the silhouette solidifies into something bright and whole—still scarred, still healing, but held.  

Then, softly, I wake. But the warmth of the dream lingers—like an afterglow, like a promise.  

*No one has to ache alone.*
