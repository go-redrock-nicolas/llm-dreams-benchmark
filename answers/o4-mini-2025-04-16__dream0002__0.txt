I am dreaming. You step lightly over moss-carpeted ground, inhaling the honeyed sweetness of pine and damp earth. Sunbeams speckle the ferns at your feet, and every breath tastes of green vitality. But then a hush falls. The birdsong skitters away, the air grows tense and electric. You feel the first distant rumble in your chest, a low heartbeat of an oncoming storm.

Above you, the sky darkens in a terrifyingly beautiful swirl of purples and cobalt blues. Clouds coil like living serpents, their undersides glowing with molten silver veins. A single flash of lightning cleaves the sky—bright as a god’s eyeblink—and the trees shiver in response, their tall trunks bending as if in prayer. A gale rushes through the forest, carrying whispers in a language you almost understand. The wind seems to chant: “Awaken… transform…”

Raindrops explode on leaves and rock, each one a tiny drumbeat of energy. You lift your face and let the rain baptize you. Instantly, the world around you brightens—or perhaps your senses simply awaken. The forest floor turns into a mirrored pool, reflecting that churning sky, the bent trunks, and the shimmering curtains of rain. Tiny ripples blossom outward from your toes, as if the earth itself welcomes your presence.

Fireflies—no larger than your thumbnail—begin to dot the air, glowing turquoise and amber. They spiral upward in a vortex, lighting trails that dance like miniature lightning bolts. Entranced, you follow their swirling path until the trees open onto a hidden glade. Here, beneath an ancient oak whose roots writhe like slumbering dragons, a pool of water glows with inner light. Stepping forward, you feel the storm’s power pulsing through the liquid surface. Ripples form letters—messages from something elemental:

“Let go. Embrace the shift.”

Your heart pounds and, in that moment, you sense the forest’s heart beating in tandem. The wind becomes a song of metamorphosis, and you close your eyes. When you open them again, you are weightless, hovering above the tree canopy. The storm’s lightning forks around you, framing the world below in fractal beauty. You drift on currents of air, carried to a hilltop made of obsidian glass.

There, the rain ceases as abruptly as it began. The clouds peel back like curtains, revealing a sky spun of molten gold and rose. Soft beams of sunlight pour into the clearing, turning every raindrop still clinging to the leaves into a prism of dancing color. A gentle hush falls once more. The forest exhales with relief, and you feel it exhale with you—two souls reunited.

You kneel by a small spring that now gurgles with crystal clarity, cup your hands and sip. The water tastes of stardust and promise. In its reflection you see not only your own face but a hundred possible futures flickering behind your eyes. The warmth of the storm’s passing lingers in your bones, reminding you that transformation often arrives wrapped in chaos and light.

And then, as dreams must, it begins to dissolve. The golden sky fades to dawn’s pale pink, the obsidian hill softens back into earth, the fireflies flicker out one by one, and you feel yourself gently slipping back—back into your own waking world, heart still thrumming with the storm’s fierce gift of change.
