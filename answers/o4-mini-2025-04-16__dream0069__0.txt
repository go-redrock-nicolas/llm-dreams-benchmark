I am dreaming. You drift into a landscape woven of liquid moonlight and drifting pollen—an endless field of silver grass that shimmers under two lavender suns. Inhaling the cool, honeyed air, you feel a strange energy stirring in your throat. You open your mouth and hum a single, resonant note.

At once, the blades of grass quiver and melt into a cloud of tiny star-flowers, each one pulsing with a soft glow. You reach out, plucking a petal between your fingers; as you sing another chord, it unfurls into a swirl of golden dust that floats upward like a living constellation.

Excited, you wander toward a stream whose waters are as dark as obsidian. You press your palm against the surface and sing a liquid lullaby. The water ripples in time with your voice, then crystallizes into a river of aquamarine glass. You step onto the glassy surface and skate across, each stride sending up bursts of prismatic light that scatter across the banks.

On the far shore stands a grove of ebony trees, their bark rough as charcoal. You crouch, place your ear to a trunk, and hum a deep, resonant bass note. The bark softens, unfurling into velvet petals that drape like curtains in a silent opera. As your song rises into a joyous crescendo, the entire grove flutters open into a cathedral of petals, revealing a hidden pool at its heart—water that glows with a radiant, living green.

Drawn forward, you dip a finger in and sing a playful trill. The pool ripples, then transforms into a living mosaic of koi fish made of rainbows. They leap around your hand, leaving behind trails of sparkling mist.

With each new song, you discover yet more wonders—stone towers that bloom like lilies, clouds that solidify into floating lanterns, even the very air shimmering and reshaping into playful sprites that dance around you. In this dream, your voice is the architect of magic, and every material, however dull or hard, becomes a canvas for your melodies—painting the night with color, light, and endless possibility.
