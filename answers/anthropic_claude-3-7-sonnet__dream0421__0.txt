I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the threshold of an ancient library that stretches infinitely in all directions. The ceiling soars to impossible heights where constellations drift across a painted sky, but these stars form patterns I've never seen in my waking life. Books with spines of shimmering metal, iridescent leather, and materials I cannot name line shelves that spiral and curve like the inner chambers of a nautilus shell.

As I step forward, my footsteps make no sound. The floor beneath me shifts from polished marble to soft moss to what appears to be flowing water that somehow supports my weight. Each step changes the library around me—sections rotating, passageways opening and closing like the breathing of some vast organism.

I reach toward a book whose spine pulses with a gentle blue light. The moment my fingers touch it, the book dissolves into thousands of tiny azure butterflies that swirl around me in a cyclone of living light. They whisper fragments of stories in languages I shouldn't understand but somehow do—tales of civilizations beneath ancient oceans, of negotiations between mountains and winds, of the secret mathematics governing the growth of forests.

The butterflies coalesce into a spiral staircase leading downward. I descend and find myself in a vast underground garden where plants grow in geometric patterns. Flowers shaped like perfect dodecahedrons bloom and unfold into new dimensions. Trees bear fruit that glows from within, casting prismatic shadows that move with purpose across the ground.

An elderly woman tends the garden, her skin etched with flowing script that shifts and changes as if rewriting her story with each breath. She looks at me with eyes that contain entire galaxies and smiles with such profound recognition that I feel I've known her since before I existed.

"You've been expected," she says, her voice harmonizing with itself in impossible chords. "The seeds you planted are ready to bloom."

I open my mouth to ask what she means, but instead of words, a symphony pours forth, echoing through the infinite library above and causing the geometric garden to transform in response to each note...
