I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, prismatic forest where the trees stretch impossibly high, their bark shifting hues like liquid opals. The air feels thick with possibility, each breath drawing in scents that trigger memories I've never made. As I step forward, I notice my footprints remain suspended in mid-air behind me, glowing softly like breadcrumbs of consciousness.

The path beneath me begins to undulate, resembling the gentle rise and fall of breathing. I realize with startling clarity that this forest is alive—not just in the ordinary sense, but as a single, ancient entity that has somehow been waiting for me.

Overhead, the sky splits into fragments of different times of day—dawn breaks in one corner while stars twinkle in another, sunset bleeds into midnight. A whisper courses through the leaves, and I understand somehow that the forest is showing me how time isn't linear but layered, just as my own memories and experiences layer upon each other to create who I am.

I encounter a clearing where floating mirrors of various shapes hover, each reflecting not my physical form but different versions of myself at various ages—the child seeking approval, the teenager building walls, the young adult afraid of vulnerability. In each reflection, I see the subtle threads connecting these selves to my present being, illuminating how early bonds and separations carved channels through which my current relationships flow.

A magnificent tree grows at the center, its branches bearing glowing fruits in which I glimpse faces of those I've loved, those who've hurt me, those who've shaped me. I understand that I've been carrying the weight of these connections, both nurturing and painful, forming patterns I've repeated without awareness.

The forest floor begins to glow with intricate, luminescent patterns—a visual manifestation of my attachment blueprint. As I trace these patterns with my fingers, they rearrange themselves, showing me possibilities beyond old habits and fears.

Rain begins to fall upward from the ground to the sky, each droplet containing a tiny scene of connection—moments where I could choose differently, where understanding might replace reaction. The forest hums with anticipation as I feel old certainties dissolving, making room for new ways of being.

I awaken gradually, not to my bed but to a deeper version of myself, carrying the forest's wisdom like a lantern illuminating paths previously hidden in shadow.
