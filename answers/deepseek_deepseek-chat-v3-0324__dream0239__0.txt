I am dreaming.  

The air itself is thick, shimmering like molten glass, yet it parts around me like water as I step forward. The ground beneath my feet is neither stone nor sand—it shifts between the two, grains fusing into smooth planes only to dissolve again into a whispering tide of particles. I kneel, pressing my palm into it, and my fingers sink as if into warm wax before the surface hardens, capturing my hand in a translucent shell. I pull free, and the substance drips from my skin like syrup, then evaporates into spiraling mist.  

A tree stands before me—or is it a fountain? Its trunk is a column of swirling liquid amber, rising and falling in slow pulses, while its branches stretch outward as vapor, curling like smoke. Leaves of solid light flicker in and out of existence, casting prismatic shadows that crawl across the shifting earth. I reach out, and my hand passes through a branch—it is air, then suddenly it is wood, rough against my fingertips, then molten, dripping golden droplets that freeze midair into floating gems.  

The sky is a living thing—not blue, not black, but a rippling expanse of mercury and indigo, streaked with veins of luminescent gas. Shapes move within it—not birds, not clouds, but something in between, their forms dissolving and reforming as they glide. One peels away from the heavens, spiraling down toward me, and as it nears, I see it is made of liquid crystal, its wings a cascade of frozen droplets held together by some unseen force. It hovers before me, and I realize it is watching me with eyes that are not eyes—pools of shifting quicksilver, reflecting not my face, but a thousand possible versions of me.  

A sound thrums through the air—not a voice, not music, but something deeper, a vibration that resonates in my bones. The ground responds, rising in slow waves, and I understand without words that this place is alive, that it is thinking, that it is dreaming me as much as I am dreaming it.  

And then—  

I am falling.  

Not downward, not upward, but through layers of reality, the world unraveling around me into strands of light and shadow. I grasp at the threads, but they slip through my fingers, some solid as rope, others dispersing like smoke. The tree-fountain shatters into a rain of liquid diamonds, the sky folds in on itself like molten origami, and I—  

I wake.  

Or do I?  

The air still shimmers. My hands are not quite solid. The dream lingers.
