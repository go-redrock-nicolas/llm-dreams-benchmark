I am dreaming. My chest

I am dreaming. My chest is a hollow chamber of crystal, delicate and vibrating with each breath. Fingers of light spill through the cracks, gold and electric blue, as though my ribs are made of stained glass. I press my palms to my sternum and feel the hum of something ancient, a resonance like a bell struck at the dawn of time. The air around me thickens, honey-slow, and when I exhale, galaxies spiral from my lips: pinwheels of stardust, constellations blooming like dandelion seeds.

The ground beneath my feet is no longer solid. It shifts and swells like liquid obsidian, forming mirrors in its wake. I catch glimpses of my reflection—countless versions of myself, each holding overflowing pomegranates, rivers of rubies spilling from their hands. They whisper in unison, a chorus that tastes like thunderstorms and wildflower rain. *You contain infinities*, they sing. *Why swallow sparks when you could birth suns?*

Above me, the sky unravels. Not a ceiling of clouds or void, but a tapestry of doors—each one glowing, ajar. Through them, I see orchards where fruit grows back the moment it’s plucked, libraries with books that rewrite themselves in real time, oceans where waves crest as liquid silver. A flock of origami cranes drifts down, folding and unfolding midair into impossible geometries. One lands on my wrist, its paper feathers whispering, *Scarcity is a myth the shadow tells to stay alive.*

I laugh, and the sound ripples outward, fractaling into colors I’ve never named. My crystal chest amplifies it—the vibration shatters the mirrors below. The shards don’t fall. They float, suspended, reflecting not what *is*, but what *could be*: fields of possibilities, neon vines tangling into bridges, staircases spiraling into undiscovered hues. 

I take a step. The ground yields like memory, shaping itself to my footfall. With each movement, I feel roots knitting beneath me—not anchors, but living threads connecting to every pulsating node of the universe. The air hums with a single truth, thick and sweet as sap: *Abundance isn’t what you hold. It’s how wide you dare to open.* 

When I wake, the afterimage lingers: a heartbeat echoing in my palms, still warm from holding light.
