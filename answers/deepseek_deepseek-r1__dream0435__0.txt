I am dreaming. I notice my body language is influencing the environment. I'll proceed with caution.
As I drift deeper into the dream, the air around me thickens into a shimmering haze, like liquid glass suspended mid-fall. My feet sink into ground that pulses like living skin, each step sending ripples of color cascading into the horizon. When I lift a hand to shield my eyes from the neon auroras twisting overhead, constellations rearrange themselves into Rorschach patterns that mirror the angle of my elbow.

A crowd of shadow-figures materializes as I tense my shoulders, their translucent forms sharpening into crystal clarity. With each nervous tap of my fingers against my thigh, obsidian monoliths burst from the earth, their surfaces etched with glowing hieroglyphs that shift from warnings to invitations depending on how I tilt my chin. I catch my reflection in a pool of mercury and realize my eyes have become kaleidoscopes - every blink projects prismatic patterns that transform weeping willows into marching soldiers into flocks of origami cranes.

When I consciously relax my posture, the world softens at the edges. My exhale sends dandelion spores blooming into jellyfish that carry the scent of forgotten birthdays. A cautious smile tugs at my lips, and suddenly the ground sprouts velvet moss that whispers childhood secrets in the language of wind chimes. I discover that holding my palms upward makes rain fall upward, each droplet capturing miniature dreams as they float toward the black sun humming like a monastic chant.

The shadow-people begin mirroring my movements with eerie precision, their once-threatening forms now undulating like seaweed in a warm current. When I cross my arms, a protective coral reef sprouts between us, but as I unfold myself and spread my fingers wide, it dissolves into a bridge of starlight. The dream holds its breath, waiting to see what my body will sculpt next.
