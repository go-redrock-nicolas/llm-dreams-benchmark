I am dreaming. The event hall stretches before me like an endless ballroom, its crystal chandeliers morphing into swirling galaxies that drip stardust onto the marble floor. I clutch my digital tablet, but the schedule keeps rearranging itself, the letters dancing and transforming into tiny black butterflies that flutter away from my grasp. The guest list of 500 world leaders has somehow become 5,000, and they're all arriving simultaneously through doors that keep multiplying along the walls.

My feet feel increasingly heavy, as though I'm wading through honey, while the clock on the wall spins backwards and forwards erratically. The catering staff are serving plates that turn into mirrors, reflecting distorted versions of the guests' faces. I reach for my phone to call for backup, but it dissolves into a puddle of liquid silver in my palm.

The flowers we carefully selected are growing at an alarming rate, their stems coiling around pillars like serpents, blooms opening and closing like hungry mouths. The sound system begins playing all songs at once, creating a cacophony that somehow sounds like whispered warnings. Important documents transform into origami cranes and soar toward the ever-shifting ceiling.

My heart pounds as I realize the President is about to arrive, but I've forgotten which version of reality I'm supposed to be presenting. The room temperature fluctuates wildly - arctic winds sweep through one moment, desert heat the next. The guests' faces begin to blur and overlap, creating a kaleidoscope of expectations and judgments that press against me like a physical weight.

I try to speak into my headset, but my words come out as colorful soap bubbles that pop with tiny screams. The red emergency exit signs start multiplying and flashing in Morse code, spelling out messages I almost understand but can't quite grasp. The weight of responsibility feels like a heavy cloak made of lead and feathers, simultaneously pulling me down and trying to lift me away from the ground that's now beginning to ripple like waves on a dark ocean...
