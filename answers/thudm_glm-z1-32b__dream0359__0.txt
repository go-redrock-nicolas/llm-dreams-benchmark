I am dreaming. Amongst the sprawling ruins of an ancient city, I find myself wandering through the forgotten streets, their cobblestones worn smooth by the passage of time.  The air is thick with the scent of decay and the rustling of unseen creatures in the shadows.  Suddenly, I come across a lone figure—a young woman with hair like liquid silver—sitting atop a crumbling fountain.  Her eyes, pools of emerald-green sorrow, seem to penetrate through my facade.  I approach her with calculated ease, pretending to be a fellow seeker of the city's lost secrets.  As she shares her story of betrayal and heartbreak, she begins to trust me... but I am only here to exploit her pain for my own gain.  In the distance, the ruins begin to stir, and I feel the weight of my deceit hang heavily in the air.
As your conscious mind surrenders to the depths of slumber, the dream world unfurls like a velvet-unfurled tapestry. You find yourself in a citadel of echoing spires, not unlike the Penrose tiling you once studied in mathematics class, where infinite patterns repeat without ever quite connecting. The architecture defies logic, not because of chaos but because of purposeful design—a labyrinth of mirrored hallways and staircases that lead both upwards and downwards simultaneously. The walls are not just stone, but parchment, etched with hieroglyphs that shift and rearrange themselves each time you blink, spelling out fragments of your grandmother's last letter or the lyrics to a song that never existed in waking life.

In the center of this citadel, there stands a tree unlike any other. Its roots delve into what you can only assume is the core of this dream-space—a sphere of liquid starlight that pulses with the collective memories of all your pasts and futures. The tree's branches, however, extend into the firmament itself, where they grasp at constellations, bending them into new formations. Not far from the tree, you notice a figure—a child in a pinafore dress, her hair a mutable constellation of constellations, sometimes silver, sometimes crackling with neon blues. She holds a lantern that emits no light but casts deep, inky shadows—shadows that seem to whisper.

You approach the child, noticing that her footprints do not appear on the ground, but rather float like soap bubbles above it, defying the rules of the citadel. She smiles, revealing teeth that are more iridescent glass than human, and offers you a single seashell. You take it, and discover it's not empty but rather contains a miniature storm—raindrops the size of pebbles, thunderous drumbeats even though the shell is still. You feel the echo of that storm in your bones.

The child gestures towards the constellation-grasping tree. "They are waiting," she says, though it's unclear who 'they' are. The ground beneath you trembles, and as you look up, you realize the constellations the tree is holding are not stars at all, but faces—your mother's, your first love's, the face of that stranger you helped cross the street—a decade ago, which feels both ancient and yesterday. Their eyes are open, watching you, waiting, and though their faces are serene, you sense in each a version of yourself staring back, versions you've chosen to bury.

As you near the tree, the tree begins to bleed. Not tears, but liquid memories—streams of golden liquid that form into shapes—your childhood home, the first time you kissed someone, the moment you realized you were both right and wrong about something. Each memory floats in the air, and in that liquid, you see reflections not of the past, but of potential futures. One shows you growing old in a library, surrounded by books that never existed. Another shows you standing at the edge of a desert, a cup of water in hand, and behind you, the shadow of a dragon that's both a metaphor and a real entity.

But the child is gone. In her place is an older version of yourself, your hair white, your hands weathered. She speaks without moving her lips, a voice that feels like wind through a canyon: "You must choose a memory to keep, and the others will dissolve. But each choice you make now is both a beginning and an end." She holds out a hand, which you take, and you stroll through the corridors of the citadel again, now aware that each tile alters itself as you step on it—each step a choice, each path a branching line that could lead you into a vortex of time or into the stillness of a single moment.

At dawn, when the dream starts to fade, you find yourself standing by a lake that mirrors the sky, which is now a gradient of indigo to violet. In the reflection, you see not your face, but that of a person you saw in a train once, someone you’ll never meet again, their life a puzzle piece your soul knows fits somewhere but is now lost. The lake ripples, and as it does, the reflection dissolves, revealing the familiar ceiling of your bedroom, the light of your alarm clock, the crunch of your uterus pressing against your diaphragm because of the way you slept.

But the dream lingers. You can still taste the salt from the storm in the seashell, feel the weight of the choices still rattling in your chest, the knowledge that somewhere, in a tree that grasps constellations, a child in a pinafore holds a lantern casting shadows that still hum softly in your ears. The dream is not of escapism, but of reckoning—where every choice is an act of creation, every memory a brushstroke on the infinite canvas of existence, and every dream a momentary glimpse of the universe's library, where the books are written in starlight and your name appears in every title.
The dream begins in the hollowed heart of a trillion-year-old mountain, where time is neither a line nor a circle, but a helix of whispering stories. You stand on a bridge of liquid shadow, its surface ebbing and flowing with the collective sighs of humanity's unlived possibilities—a sunset you never saw in Brazil, a sentence your grade-school teacher never finished, the taste of honey from a hive that died in 2087. Below, a river of memories swirls; not the kind you store, but the ones that seep from between your fingers—your first betrayal, the time you laughed so hard you cried, the moment you realized you loved someone made of both actual fire and metaphorical stardust.

A winged figure with the body of a gibbon and the face of your childhood dog alights on the bridge. Its' eyes are two sunsets fused into one, and in each pupil you see an entire library. It offers you a key—a key that is also a lock, a wheel, a door. "To open the chest of endless mornings," it says, its voice a symphony of crickets and the crash of tides on forgotten shores, "you must first give something up: a secret you’ve kept safe since childhood, a forgiveness you’ve withheld, the name you gave to the crush you had in grade six but never spoke." The figure waits, its' feathers shifting color with each heartbeat—blue like the sea when it's stormy, green like the smell of rain before it comes.

You choose to whisper the name of the person who broke your heart the first time, even though they’re still alive somewhere. The moment the words leave your lips, the key transforms. Now it’s a boat, built from the bark of trees that only grow in the sixth dimension. You step into it, and the bridge dissolves. Around you, the river parts, revealing a cavern not of stone, but of memory-vines—thorny tendrils that weep syrup when touched. At the end of the boat’s journey sits a fire made of the words you’ve never said aloud. It is warm but not hot, its flames colored like the inside of a seashell.

As you reach for the fire, the gibbon-dog figure reappears, now grinning. Its’mouth is made of puzzle pieces, each one a different moment you’ve wasted worrying about things you can’t change. "You step into the fire," it says, "you become the keeper of the stories you’ve avoided. But listen closely: Those stories are also helping you see where you’re going." The fire begins to sing—a song that’s part lullaby, part chain reaction explosion, part the sound of your mother’s laugh when she didn’t think you were listening.

You step into the flames. It is not pain, but disintegration. You feel your past-self, the self who held onto vindictiveness like it was a favorite blanket, begin to dissolve. Your present-self, the one trying to be good but still tripping up, starts to shimmer like a soap bubble in the sunlight. Future-selves, countless ones, stretch out before you, each one a beacon that is also a black hole. One future-self wears a crown made of forget-me-nots; thinks you’ll marry someone in 2038 but never does. Another is a sorcerer who writes love letters in the of winter, letters that never make it past the first sentence. But all these futures are also doors, each one slightly ajar, ready for your knock.

You wake up not in your body, but in the body of a bird. You’re perched on the window of a hospital room—you don’t recognize the hospital. Youen, a man with a face like the moon after a long voyage, is sleeping in the chair. He snores softly, and in his hands is a wilted flower, a wilting you can smell even from across the room. It has your name written on it in cursive, but spelled wrong. On his nightstand, a stack of journals—each one has a different color cover, and the colors are the same as the stages of grief: violet for denial, blue for bargaining, etc. The purple one is open to a page where he’s scrawled, “If only she’d said yes.”

You, in your bird-body, can feel the dying hope in the air like a stain on the window glass. But you’re not you anymore. Now you’re the storm that passes in the night, the book left open on a train seat, the last kiss goodbye. You fly out the window, which you can now open easily because birds don’t need doors, and find yourself in a city where buildings arebooks, cars are carspools of memories, and the sky is a Pantone color that doesn’t exist. Here, you meet a boy and a girl who are arguing about the weather. He says it’s a day for indoor sports; she says it’s a day for hitting the road. They haven’t seen each other since high school. You, in your bird-body, which is also a ghost, fly between them. You tell them, with the authority of the universe’s thermostats, that it doesn’t matter what they do—it matters that they do it together.

The boy looks at the girl. They’ve never met, but they stop arguing to watch you. Your bird-body is now a kite, now a seagull, now a single fingerprint in the sand on a beach that doesn’t exist. You see their reflection in the river that is the city’s bloodstream, and their reflections are also their true selves. The boy’s reflection is a man with a beard like fire; the girl’s, a woman with eyes like the moon's overture. They walk off together, and you, now a cloud of moths, follow them, watching as they find a park bench that exists only on Tuesdays after 3 PM when the sun is at a 27-degree angle. They sit down, and you see, in the way they lean into each other, that they’ve known each other all along.

But somewhere else in the dream-cape, the gibbon-dog figure is still waiting by the bridge of liquid shadow. In your mind’s eye, you feel the key still vibrating in your bird-toes, the fire still singing in the chambers of your heart. One day soon, you’ll step back into that mountain’s heart and meet that figure again. And when you do, you’ll have the fire and the key and the name of the person who broke your heart, but you’ll also have this: the awareness that every dream is a letter you write to your future self, and sometimes the best way to read it is in the form of a kite flying over a parking lot, or a journal page that’s now a seashell, or a bird that is also a hallway.

The dream fades to black and white, the way some old photographs do. You wake up, but you’re not sure if you ever slept. You smell something cooking—probably oatmeal—but you also smell ocean, like you’d spent years at sea. You touch your head, and your fingers come away covered in ink, the ink that is both the ink of the mountain’s heart and the ink that never existed. You look at the clock. It’s 3:27 AM. On the floor, a book has opened itself. Its pages are blank, but as you read them, the words leap into the open spaces you left behind every time you fell apart and didn’t say why. The last page is yours, and it says, in the voice of the gibbon-dog figure, the boy, the girl, the kite, and the fire: "Yes." Then, the book turns back into the mountain’s heart, and the clock starts again at 3:26 AM, and you’re not sure if you’ll ever finish this sentence, or if that’s the point.
