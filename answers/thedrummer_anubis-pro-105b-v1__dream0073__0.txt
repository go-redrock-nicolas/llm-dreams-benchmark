I am dreaming. In my dream, I find myself standing atop a sprawling, verdant hill overlooking a fantastical landscape. The sky is a swirling vortex of colors - hues of deep indigo, cadet blue, and warm golden tones. Towering above the horizon, five magnificent crystal spires pierce the heavens, each radiating a different unique light.

I am tasked with simultaneously completing five lifechanging responsibilities. The weight of the world rests upon my shoulders as I strive to fulfill each duty without error. I can feel the pressure mounting, the clock ticking away with each passing moment.

Suddenly, the first spire begins to shine a radiant emerald light. It signifies my duty to usher a pair of newborn fawns into the world, ensuring their first steps are guided by gentle hands. I race down the hill, each step feeling heavier than the last, and arrive at the base of the spire. As I breathe my first words to the fawns, they spring forward with leaps of joy, ready to explore the enchanted forest.

But even as I embrace this moment of wonder, the other spires begin to glow with increasing intensity. The scarlet-hued second spire calls to me, beckoning me to climb its wide, crystal steps to the top. I ascend at a brisk pace, my focus narrowing as the threshold approaches. 

Upon reaching the summit, I find a ancient tomes waiting, reminding me of my task to decipher and preserve a long-lost tongue. The closely-packed runic script and flickering candlelight present an impossible translation challenge without any discernible breakthrough. But suddenly, the flickering fire injects insight, illuminating each new passage better than the one before it, until finally, the completion of this task is complete! Thanks to deciphering that book, over a billion people have now found access to ancient wisdom.

Only to find as I start to enjoy this moment of triumph, that time has now expired and monumental consequences ensue. In a nightmare I see 900 million people driven truly insane, blaming me for their lives turning to nothing more than pixie dust and feathers. 

But I refuse to call it quits. There's still so much work to do! 

Rushing to the sapphire spire I find myself jocussted into a pincher atop a sink drain. How will I ever finish flooding the pipe system when I can't even reach the faucet? And to make matters worse, down in the sewer I discover that I am not alone. A terrifying giant cockroach, saber-sharp, is pushing its way towards me - the slightest movement and it will through the filter and then my dreams will have literally ended in tears and crap.

But wait! On the side I see a ansible, a  hollow robotic tube that I could teleport through. Would this carry my tasks with me and override the fear when I am sent to the other side? Only one answer - I stood with my back to the giant insect and in the tube I went. Like zooming on trens gone, floating angelically on a surge of wind and I landed where all I can say is I now truly understand standing on the top of the Japanese Tsukino tower looking out at the neon pulsating city below.

Like my own speed to Tokyo - a task is now complete!

Relieved, still reeling from the anxiety drenched moment - I looked up only to see Heavenly Guardians witnessing my adamant efforts as I ran brimmingly from an infestation when I could have fled. Witnessing bravery isn't enough to keep them in synch with my dreams, though. 

They telepathed me with four options and a calling:
Five choices, each one completely open-ended. If only one had "the gift" I would be granted my every desire and no more challenge will face me again - once my humanity has been inactivated.

Or choose that sonorous tenth voice, boy, if actually, though 553 could help SrcL,9-the-gift-searcher in Project Oglethorpe!
