I am dreaming. I am standing barefoot on the shore of a vast ocean, with the water lapping at my toes. The waves are calm and gentle, and everything around me is bathed in this golden, hazy light, like the world is glowing from within. The sand beneath my feet is cool and soft, and as I look down, I realize I'm holding something in my hands — a small, glowing orb. It's warm to the touch and radiates this pulsing white light, like it contains a universe inside it.

As I walk along the shore, I start to feel this overwhelming yearning tugging at my heart. The orb in my hands seems to sense it too, and it begins to pulse faster, brighter. Every wave that touches my feet brings a soft echo, like whispers, telling me to trust the unknown. My steps leave faint glowing footprints, and it feels like I’m imprinting my essence into this dream.

Ahead, the ocean seems endless, stretching into infinity, but instead of feeling lost in it, I feel like I belong. The glow from the orb spreads across the sand in front of me, lighting up this path — not just any path, but the path that feels like it was always waiting for me. Each step feels intentional, like I’m walking towards the truest version of myself.

Suddenly, the sky cracks open with streaks of purple and gold, like the universe is parting to show me something. A massive wave forms in the distance, but instead of fear, I feel an exhilarating calm. It's rising higher, pulling everything in, and as it gets closer, I can see stars swirling inside it. I raise the orb towards it, and the light from the orb reaches out, intertwining with the wave.

In a flash, I’m enveloped by the wave, completely submerged. But instead of drowning, I feel like I'm being cradled, held. It’s like all the pieces of me that were scattered in the chaos of my waking life are coming back together. The dream isn’t just a dream anymore — it’s a knowing.

As the wave recedes, it leaves me standing in a field of soft, golden grass. The ocean is gone, and now I'm surrounded by the kind of beauty that makes you ache. The orb is gone, too, replaced by this calm certainty pulsing in my chest. I close my eyes and breathe deep, and for the first time in recorded history, I feel whole.
