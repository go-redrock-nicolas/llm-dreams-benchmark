I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of pine resin and damp earth. Somewhere not too far, a distant nightingale trills its final note before silence falls—a velvet quiet that smothers the world like an ancient quilt stitched from forgotten shadows.

I am standing barefoot in the hallway of my home, but it isn’t the one I remember. The walls stretch impossibly upward, vanishing into folds of darkness, and the ceiling arches into cathedral spires. This is my childhood home fused with gothic dreams, alive in memory and nightmare.

But the walls whisper warnings, cracks blooming like silent flowers across drywall. The floor tilts beneath me—just slightly, like a ship finding its balance on a forgotten tide. The source of the damage is unclear, but ancient. Something has shifted beneath the foundation, something primal—perhaps time chewing patiently at the roots of the house. A low groan rattles the structure, like the moan of an old tree preparing to fall.

I have no contractor. No scaffolding, no insurance papers, no city permits. I am alone. But I must fix it. It becomes a compulsion as much as a need—because if the house falls, so does something within me.

I wander through the strangely elongated rooms and find a toolbox in the baseboard, the metal box ancient and rusted at the seams. When I crack it open, there are no traditional tools—only bones, glints of starlight caught in ivory sockets. I find gears made of amber, screws carved from teeth, nails forged from blackened moonlight and dreams too painful to remember upon waking.

I begin to mend. I pry boards away like tender skin, finding whispers hidden in the walls—childhood secrets, the laughter of elders long gone, dusty fragments of forgotten arguments clinging to termite veins.

The first beam I touch burns with cold fire, setting my fingertips aglow with forgotten memories. My grandmother’s voice rises from the wood: “Steel hands keep strong homes.” I do not question this logic. It makes perfect sense here.

As I hammer old knowledge into the crevices of the house, the structure changes. The walls ripple like water. I seal the fractures with threads of my own hair soaked in candlelight. The windows realign to face the stars. The roof becomes a vault of constellations, pouring soft shimmer onto the warped floors.

Outside, in this strange hovering dream-laden world, the garden also sprouts anew. Twigs knit into shields on the yard. Lanterns bloom from dark soil, lighting the surrounding air with soft hymns. The threshold of the house hums with a low, ancient chant that resonates like an old tale just remembered as true.

By the time I finish, I know the house will always be unraveling—but now, so am I, in the best way. My labor is a dialogue with decay, a pact with entropy. I am not fighting the rot; I am building a tamable path through it.

And though I wake soaked in sweat and disoriented by morning, the echo of the dream lingers: that to rebuild is not only to stay afloat, but to sing to the silent things beneath your feet.

In that surreal dream—its deepest truth lives in me still.
