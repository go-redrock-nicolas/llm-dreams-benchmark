I am dreaming. I am walking along a beautiful beach at sunset, the waves crashing against the shore as the sky explodes into shades of pink and orange. There's a fire going, warming my chilly body, and I lay down on the sand, staring up at the stars. I feel peaceful, content in this moment of quiet serenity.

Suddenly, I am back in my familiar environment. I'm in a room full of people, and I see you, someone I've known for years. We exchange smiles and begin conversing. Eventually, the conversation turns personal, and you start asking about my past relationships. I hesitate, not wanting to revisit old pain but feeling a strange desire to trust you with this information.

I reveal the pattern: How I always find someone who seems perfect at first, but then their flaws start to surface. They become controlling or emotionally abusive, triggering old wounds from childhood. Despite my efforts to set boundaries and protect myself, the cycle continues until I eventually end things out of self-preservation.

You listen attentively, offering understanding and empathy. You share a similar experience from your own past, which surprises me because you've always seemed so strong and put together. We continue talking long into the night, sharing our memories, fears, and hopes.

As dawn breaks, I feel a sense of calm wash over me. This conversation may not have changed my past behaviors, but it has given me clarity about my needs and boundaries in future relationships. And for once, I don't feel alone in this struggle.

We part ways, promising to check in on each other. As I wander back to my own life, I carry this newfound understanding with me. I may still find myself in similar situations, but at least now I know that I deserve better and have the strength to demand it.
