I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I find myself in a warm, intimate therapy room draped in rich, earthy colors. The walls pulse with a soft, ethereal glow that seems to emanate from an unknown source. Your eyes meet mine across a plush, coffee-brown leather couch where you sit, shoulders hunched and face tense with obvious distress.

As I take my seat in a matching armchair, the leather creaks softly beneath me, releasing the subtle aroma of aged hide into the air. My hand moves instinctively to the small, ornate clock on the side table - a reminder of the ticking seconds we'll traverse together in this journey of healing.

You voice your troubles, and I listen intently, absorbing each word as if they were precious gems to be treasured. The emotions pour out in a tumultuous waterfall, each dropping a shade deeper than the last, threatening to spill over the edges of your restraint. I nod encouragingly, making sure you know you're heard, understood, valued.
