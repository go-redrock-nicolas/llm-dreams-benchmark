I am dreaming. ....

I find myself standing before an ornate antique mirror in a dimly lit Victorian parlor, my reflection showing me dressed in clothes from another era. There's a leather-bound book on a nearby table - I know with dream-logic certainty that it contains powerful knowledge that could help someone I love who is gravely ill. But I also know it was stolen from its rightful owner, an elderly scholar who spent decades collecting arcane wisdom.

As I reach for the book, my hands trembling slightly, I hear myself constructing elaborate justifications: "He has so many books, surely he won't miss this one... My need is greater... I'll return it once I've learned what I need to know... Sometimes the ends justify the means..." Each rationalization feels more convincing than the last, even as a deeper part of me recognizes these as hollow excuses.

The room seems to shift and darken around me as I argue with my conscience. The wallpaper ripples like living tissue, and the mirror's reflection shows subtle distortions - my face appearing slightly more shadowed, my eyes a touch harder with each justification I create. I can feel my moral certainties becoming as fluid as the dream-space itself.

I find myself picking up the book, the leather warm and alive under my fingers. The guilt I should feel is being transformed into a righteous sense of necessity. Yet even as I clutch the book to my chest, the mirror shows my reflection turning away in shame, refusing to meet my eyes - a silent witness to the small corruption taking place in my soul.

The dream-logic makes my choice feel both inevitable and horrifying, as if I'm watching myself slowly transform into someone I wouldn't recognize in waking life. The parlor grows darker still, and I can hear distant thunder - or perhaps it's the sound of my own conscience trying to break through the elegant web of justifications I've woven...
