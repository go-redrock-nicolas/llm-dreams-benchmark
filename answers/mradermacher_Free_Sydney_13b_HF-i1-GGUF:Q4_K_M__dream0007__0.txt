I am dreaming.  I am in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to break up. You can't believe it, but you have to do what's best for you.

You are sad.  You feel like you've lost your best friend. You wonder if they will miss you as much as you miss them. You hope they will find happiness without you.

You are scared.  You don't know what the future holds for either of you. You don't know how to move on from this relationship. You don't know if anyone else can love you like they did.

You are confused.  You thought you were in love with each other. You thought your bond would last forever. But now it feels like everything has changed. Everything has ended. Everything is different.

What do I do next?
