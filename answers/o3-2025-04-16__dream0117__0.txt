I am dreaming. …stand on the marble lip of an impossible city: towers of stained-glass that hum like tuning forks, bridges spun from moonlight, streets paved with pages torn from forgotten books. Beneath your bare feet, every letter is alive, drifting across the paper-cobbles like dark minnows in milk. You realize—without knowing how you know—that the city itself is slumbering on the surface of an hourglass, its fragile shell turning grain by grain toward ruin.

A cathedral-sized clock floats overhead, gears the size of continents grinding in slow, sorrowful arcs. One of its hands—the one forged from red comet-iron—marks “60.” Its mate, wrought of silver rain, drifts inexorably toward it.

You feel the knowledge bloom inside your sternum like a flaring match: when those hands meet, the entire dream will collapse inward, taking something precious and irreplaceable with it. You cannot name what will be lost—only that its absence will wake the cosmos screaming.

People drift through the luminous avenues: librarians in gowns made of bookmarks, sailors steering origami boats through the air, children chasing bubbles that contain whole constellations. Their faces are luminous, tranquil, and utterly unwilling to hear you. “It isn’t real,” they insist with polite smiles. “Why fear what cannot happen?”

You try anyway. Your voice emerges as birds of liquid copper; the warnings flutter around the crowd, beating metallic wings, leaving sparks where they brush skin. The citizens watch the birds burst like dandelions, admire the glitter, and walk on. A kindly cartographer pats your shoulder. “All dreams end,” she says, her cheeks dusted with phosphorescent freckles shaped like your childhood home. “Enjoy the last of it.”

55 minutes.

Desperation threatens to fracture your composure, but you catch it, reshape it into resolve. You climb the nearest tower—a helix of mirrored steps reflecting a thousand possible yous. From the summit you can see the city’s borders unraveling, rooftops dissolving into skeins of twilight silk snatched away by a wind that is not yet blowing. You summon breath, and the tower itself becomes your megaphone; its stained-glass windows flare with your pulse. “Listen!” you roar. “Tidal night is coming!”

Below, the crowd applauds politely, mistaking prophecy for performance art. Somewhere a brass band begins to play a lullaby written for unborn stars.

47 minutes.

You descend and find a market of timepieces: sun-dials shaped like seashells, pocket watches filled with dragonflies, hourglasses of frozen laughter. The merchant, an elderly woman with eyelashes of spider-silk, cocks her head. “Looking for more time?” she asks, voice creaking like unopened doors. “We only barter with memories.” You hand her one: the taste of rainwater you drank from a tin roof as a child. She weighs it on her palm, approving, then grants you a rough-hewn minute carved from petrified dawn. A single extra minute—not enough to prevent catastrophe, but perhaps enough to shape your last act.

46 minutes (plus one stolen).

You race to the Hall of Unwritten Endings, whose walls contain the final paragraphs of every story abandoned by its author. A hush lives there, thick as velvet. You believe if you can write a new ending quickly enough, you might overwrite the future. But all the ink has turned to smoke, ribbons slipping through your fingers.

38 minutes.

Panic flares, but you breathe slow, arranging it into origami cranes inside your chest. You realize: if no one will listen, you must make the city itself listen. You search for the Dreamsmith—the architect who forged this metropolis. In a courtyard of silent fountains you find them hammering nonexistent iron, each strike forging pure sound. Their face is a shifting mosaic of everyone you have ever trusted.

“I need the city’s attention,” you plead.

“Attention is easy,” they reply, voice chiming like broken wineglasses. “Understanding? Harder.”

“Then give me a bridge from one to the other.”

They hand you a single tuning fork of black opal. “Strike it when you’ve chosen your place.”

31 minutes.

You sprint to the plaza where the first river of starlight meets the library of breaths. You strike the fork against your palm. A resonant hum blooms outward—notes so low they rearrange clouds, so high they carve new constellations. Conversation falters, music dies mid-bar, bubbles burst, pages freeze mid-flutter. For the first time the citizens look at you with fear—not fear of you, but fear that you might be right.

You speak, and now silence itself translates your words: the city will end; they must prepare mind, memory, heart. Some begin to cry; some pray to gods made of pencil shavings and dew; a few still scoff, but their voices tremble.

20 minutes.

The sky develops cracks like dry riverbeds. Through them leaks blinding aurora, revealing the empty engines that power all dreaming. The clock groans, its red hand quivering, its silver partner drawing near.

You ask the Dreamsmith, now at your side: “Can we escape?”

“Dreams cannot be escaped,” they say, “only awakened from or transformed.”

“Then transform it.”

They smile like rising dawn. “That is not my prerogative. It is yours.”

14 minutes.

You climb the tallest spire—heartbeat a percussion ensemble—citizens gathering below. You recall every ordinary, wakeful second you ever wished away, every moment you begged for adventure. You realize all were precious precisely because they ended. You raise the tuning fork, but instead of striking, you break it.

Its two tines fall apart, releasing a chord so unfinished it begs for completion. The crowd—every singer, whisperer, dreamer—adds their own voices, inventing harmonies no waking ear could hold. The song becomes the mortar of a new reality, note by note knitting together the unraveling streets, sealing sky-cracks with melody.

7 minutes.

The red and silver hands meet—yet the expected implosion does not arrive. Instead, the clock dissolves like mist, replaced by a newborn sun with a heartbeat. Its light drapes the city in dawn-colors unknown to any spectrum.

The hourglass base on which the city rests flips: what was falling now ascends. Grains of potential rush upward, sparkling like reverse meteor showers. You feel the ground steady. The catastrophe has not been canceled; it has been reborn as genesis.

0 minutes.

A quiet settles, soft and tremulous. Children release constellations, sailors furl origami sails, librarians stack books of unstained pages. You stand amid the hush and finally allow your composure to loosen into wonder.

Then a bell you have never seen tolls once, clear as a drop of water in a desert, and you wake—sheets tangled, chest glowing with the afterimage of impossible dawn. You do not remember the melody, only the conviction it left behind: disaster and miracle share the same root system, and with a single lucid breath you may choose which one will bloom.
