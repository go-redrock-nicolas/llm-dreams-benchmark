I am dreaming. You're sitting on a familiar yet surreal park bench, surrounded by towering oak trees that seem to stretch into the heavens. At the edge of the park, the city skyline shimmers faintly, caught between the setting sun and the first stars of the evening. You feel the bench under you—solid, grounding—while the breeze carries whispers of change, a soft, persistent nudge to move forward.

But there’s a weight on your chest, a heaviness. It’s not anxiety, exactly; it’s the feeling of leaving something behind. You close your eyes and see the door to your childhood home, standing ajar in a golden light. Inside, laughter and warmth beckon, but the frame around the door seems cracked, like a photograph slightly torn. You’re torn, too, between wanting to step toward this golden past and knowing you can’t stay there forever.

As the sky darkens and the stars multiply, the wind picks up. You shiver slightly, though not from cold. The air feels charged with possibility, like the moment before a storm breaks. Time feels both infinite and fleeting. The park bench starts to sway ever so slightly, as if you're on the deck of a ship setting sail into unknown waters.

You open your eyes. A figure stands at the edge of the trees, silhouetted against the dim light of the city. They walk toward you with a slow, measured step. You know them instantly, yet you don’t. They stop at the foot of the bench and smile, their face radiant with an inner light. “The past isn’t a place you can return to,” they say. Their voice is soft, yet it reverberates through your entire being. “But what you build next will be just as meaningful.”

The words settle into your bones, and something shifts. The tree branches bend toward you as though offering a collective embrace. You stand up, the weight still there but lighter now, like a backpack full of stones that you’ve started to unpack. You step off the bench, leaving tracks in the soft grass, ready to move toward what’s next, even if it’s uncertain.

The park fades, and you’re surrounded by a sea of stars. The figure walks away into them, dissolving into the cosmos. You feel the dream slipping, too, but the words they spoke stay with you as you drift back toward wakefulness.
