I am dreaming. the scene is fuzzy at first, like an old photograph struggling to materialize.  I'm standing in a forest, but not any forest I've seen before.  The trees are tall and slender, their trunks spiraling like DNA double helixes, and the leaves shimmer with an iridescence that shifts colors with each step I take.What a curious place.  I walk forward, the ground springing softly underfoot.  It feels like walking on a giant's padded carpet.  The air smells of ozone and something sweet, like caramelized apples.  Above the treetops, the sky is a kaleidoscope of colors - purples blending into violets, streaked with gold ribbons.  It's day, but the sun is nowhere to be seen.  Instead, a cluster of floating lanterns illuminates the area, their flames dancing with a liquid mercury glow.  Each lantern has a tiny, animated face that seems to watch me as I pass.

I hear a distant hum, a low-frequency sound that resonates in my bones.  It's both unsettling and oddly soothing.  Following the sound, I come across a clearing.  In the center stands an enormous tree, its trunk as wide as a city block.  The bark is smooth but translucent, revealing a swirling liquid inside - almost like observing the core of a star trapped in amber.  From its branches hang fruits, but these aren't regular fruits.  They're glowing orbs, pulsating with colors that match the sky.  Each orb pulses with a different rhythm, and when their pulses synchronize briefly, the air crackles with energy.

Next to the tree is a small pool of water, but the surface is hardened into a polished mirror.  My reflection stares back, but not my ordinary one.  This reflection has antlers branching from its head, delicate and multifaceted like glass.  The eyes in the reflection don't match mine - they're golden, unblinking, wise.  When I reach out to touch the water, the surface ripples, and the antlers on the reflection twitch as if alive.

The hum grows louder.  I notice tiny, winged creatures flitting around the tree.  They're not birds or insects, but something between both.  Their wings are translucent, each cell containing a miniature galaxy.  As they fly, they leave trails of light that linger in the air like after-images.  Catching one in my palm, it doesn't struggle.  Instead, it turns into a dewdrop filled with tiny constellations.  Opening my hand, the drop lands on the mirror-like pool, causing ripples that spread into the tree's trunk.  The tree shivers, and the liquid inside brightens, sending pulses of light through its veins.

I realize the tree is communicating - not with sound, but in waves of light and color.  The message feels like understanding without words: *This forest is a memory of things yet to be remembered.*  My skin tingles, charged with a strange energy.  The lanterns above dim slightly, and the sky begins to swirl, mixing colors into a vortex.  A path of glowing stones emerges before me, leading deeper into the forest.  There's a choice - follow, or stay here in this liminal space.

Curiosity compels me forward.  Each step along the stones feels like stepping into another layer of reality.  The air prickles with anticipation.  The tree's glow fades as I move on, replaced by the whispering wind that carries fragments of unknown languages.  Ahead, the forest transforms.  Trees now have bark made of shifting shadows, and the path leads to a waterfall... but the water is flowing upward, defying gravity, its droplets sparkling like shattered diamonds in the strange light.

At the base of the fall stands a figure, its form fluid and indistinct, like smoke given shape.  It speaks, but its voice isn't heard through ears.  *"The answers you seek are within the questions,"* it says, its form rippling like heat waves.  *"To wonder is to unravel.  Carry this truth onward."*  

Before I can ask more, the figures begins to dissolve, merging with the upward-flowing water.  The forest twists once more, and I'm back at the edge of the clearing.  The tree's liquid core now pulses slower, dimmer.  The strange antlered reflection in the pool is gone.  The lanterns above are fewer now, some burnt out, others flickering.

I wake with astartled gasp, the residue of the dream clings to me - the scent of caramelized apples, the hum in my bones.  My hands feel cool, as if I still hold the dewdrop of constellations.  Distant, but not forgotten, the forest waits in the realms of the subconscious, ready to reveal more secrets another night to one who approaches with curiosity\n
