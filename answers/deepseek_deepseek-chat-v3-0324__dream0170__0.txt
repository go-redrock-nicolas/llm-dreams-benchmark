I am dreaming. **The Arena of Echoing Whispers**  

The air hums with electricity as I step onto the arena floor—a vast, circular expanse of polished black stone that seems to drink in the light. Around me, the tournament grounds stretch into infinity, tiered stands of obsidian and gold thrumming with the presence of spectators, though when I glance up, their faces blur like smudged charcoal, their voices reduced to an oceanic murmur. The only clarity comes from my opponents: seven masters, each a legend in their own right. A swordsman whose blade hums with the resonance of a singing storm. An archer whose arrows leave behind trails of frozen light. A dancer whose every step unravels seams in reality.  

The final challenge is not battle—not yet. It is *revelation.*  

Before us stands a towering, faceless figure—the Arbiter—cloaked in liquid shadow. Its voice is the sound of pages turning in an ancient book. *"You must show us the shape of your soul."*  

One by one, the masters step forward. The swordsman cuts the air, and his stroke cleaves open a rift in space—an endless, spiraling galaxy unspools from his blade. The archer fires a single arrow, and it splits into a flock of radiant birds, each singing a different forgotten language. The dancer pirouettes, and the ground beneath her blooms into a garden of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a different lifetime.  

Now it is my turn. My heart drums against my ribs. I have no legendary technique, no lifetime of devotion—only the dream itself.  

I close my eyes.  

When I open them again, the arena is gone. Suspended in an infinite void, my body dissolves into threads of silver smoke. From the haze, *memories* surge forth—not just mine, but *theirs.* The swordsman’s first bloody knuckle after a decade of training. The archer’s lonely nights tracing constellations on her palms. The dancer’s quiet sob when no one saw, the night before her first performance.  

I am not just me. I am the weight of their years, the echoes of their sacrifices.  

The Arbiter’s laughter is the chiming of distant bells. *"You do not master a skill—you let it master *you.*"*  

The dream shudders.  

The tournament was never about winning.  

It was about surrender.  

And then—I wake.
