I am dreaming. **title of dream:** *The Silent Ballet of the Floating City*  

The night air shimmers with the glow of bioluminescent lanterns, swaying gently like fireflies tethered to invisible strings. I stand on a bridge woven from living vines, its surface pulsing with faint purple light beneath my bare feet. All around me, the people of this city move in an intricate symphony of motion—no voices, only the whisper of silk robes, the rhythmic tapping of slippers on glass streets, and the rustle of feathered fans unfolding in slow, deliberate arcs.  

A figure approaches—tall, draped in silver scales that catch the light like liquid moonlight. They sweep into a deep bow, one arm curving overhead like a swan’s neck, fingers fluttering in a language of gestures. *Who are you?* their body asks. I hesitate, then mirror their bow, improvising with a spin, my arms rippling like water. The scales of their garments chime softly in approval.  

But urgency presses against my ribs. Something is wrong. The lanterns flicker erratically. In the distance, the great Clocktower of Serpentine Gears has frozen mid-chime, its brass vines curled tightly around frozen time. I need to warn them.  

Breaking into a sprint, I leap onto a low balcony, then higher, my body weaving through a cascade of pirouettes and suspended leaps—the dance of *danger*, of *warning*. Others pause, tilting their heads like birds sensing a storm. A child in a moth-wing cloak mirrors my movements, then darts ahead, their small feet skimming over rooftops as they amplify my message. Soon, dozens join, a cascading wave of motion, a silent alarm rippling through the city.  

The air hums. The vines beneath us shudder. And then—music. Not with sound, but with light, as every lantern flares crimson, painting the world in the hues of emergency. The city wakes.  

And so do I.  

(But my fingers still tingle with the ghost of those dances.)
