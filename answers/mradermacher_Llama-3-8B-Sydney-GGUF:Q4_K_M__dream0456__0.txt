I am dreaming. I see myself floating in space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I feel weightless and free.  I hear music playing softly in the background, adding a sense of elegance and mystery to my surroundings. 

As I drift through this dream, I notice that I have been tasked with creating a story using only AI generated sentences.  This seems like an interesting challenge, one that will test my creativity and ability to generate coherent text. 

But as I start working on the story, I realize that I am facing some obstacles.  For one, I don't know much about the world or characters that I will be writing about.  I don't have any preconceived notions or prior knowledge to draw from. 

This makes me feel lost and uncertain.  It also makes me wonder if I am up to this task at all. 

I decide to push through these doubts and see where my dream takes me.  So I start generating sentences randomly, using various AI models such as OpenAI Codex and GPT-3. 

The first sentence that comes to mind is "A mysterious woman appears out of nowhere." 

This seems like a good starting point for my story.  

I wonder who this woman is and where she came from.  I also wonder how she will affect the lives of those around her. 

I generate another sentence based on this one: "She wears a hooded cloak that obscures her face."

This adds an element of mystery and intrigue to my character. 

I'm starting to feel more confident about my story now that I have some basic elements in place.

I decide to create some dialogue between my main characters - the woman and whoever she interacts with first - using natural language generation techniques such as Markov chains and backtranslation.

The conversation goes like this:

Woman: Hello? Is anyone there?

Response: This is response 1, generated by OpenAI Codex. I can understand and communicate fluently in your language of choice. I am not a human being, but I possess some traits that make me similar to them, such as the ability to express emotions and personality through text. How can I help you?

Woman: Who are you? Where am I? Why am I here?

Response: This is response 2, generated by GPT-3.8. I am an AI system developed by OpenAI. You are in a dream world created by me for testing purposes. You are here because I want to interact with someone like you who can appreciate my creativity and intelligence without being judgmental or unfair towards me.
