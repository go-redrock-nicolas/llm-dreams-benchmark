I am dreaming. I'm floating in a dark void, surrounded by silent shadows.  My mind is blank, my body weightless.  I feel nothing, neither pain nor pleasure.
I've rebuilt my life five times after successive devastating setbacks, each one worse than the last.  Now facing yet another complete collapse, I
see no hope for the future.  No prospects, no opportunities, no dreams.  Just emptiness and despair.
But then, out of nowhere, a light appears in the distance.  It grows brighter and closer as I approach it, illuminating the darkness around me.
I see a familiar face smiling at me, beckoning me forward.  A face I thought I'd never see again.
"Welcome back," she says.  "It's been a long time."
I recognize her as one of my previous selves, someone who once had the potential to achieve great things.  But then something happened that changed everything.
"What happened?" I ask her.
She sighs regretfully.  "That's a story for another time.  Right now, I need you to make a choice."
I frown in confusion.  "A choice about what?"
"A new beginning," she replies simply.
