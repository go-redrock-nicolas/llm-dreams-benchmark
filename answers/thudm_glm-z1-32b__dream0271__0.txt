I am dreaming. My hands are trembling slightly as I grasp the edge of the glass observation deck hovering 4,500 feet above the clouds. The winds buffet my skin, but the chill is overridden by a heady mix of adrenaline and anticipation—the kind that courses through veins when destiny’s door is about to swing wide. Below, the city unfolds in a patchwork of neon constellations, each streetlight and skyscraper a glowing thread in a tapestry woven from twilight’s dye. The air tastes electric, like summer storms on the horizon. I can almost hear the distant rumble of thunder, but it’s drowned out by the thumping of my heart syncing with the pulse of the metropolis beneath. This is it—the moment I’ve traded sleepless nights and empty coffee mugs for. Yet, as I lean forward, a shadow flickers in the corner of my vision. It’s not fear, not quite—the sensation is more akin to a spider’s whisper on the back of the neck. In the distance, a clock tower chimes an hour too late. somewhere deep in the marrow of my bones, a primal voice murmurs that some doors, once opened, don’t merely lead to triumph, but to thresholds that unravel the very fabric of what we believe to be real. I blink, and the city swallows the shadow whole. For now, the stars burn brighter.
