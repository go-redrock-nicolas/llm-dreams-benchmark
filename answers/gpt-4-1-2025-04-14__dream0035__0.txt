I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the heart of a bustling, sun-washed plaza—a swirl of color and movement, where houses rise in honeycomb tiers and enormous lanterns sway above a mosaic of cobblestones. The language here rolls through the air in melodies—rippling, playful syllables that flutter like songbirds around me, utterly unfamiliar, yet somehow inviting.

My heart thrums with nervous excitement as I approach the first person I see: an elderly woman with silvered hair coiled high, her eyes crinkling warmly above a cloak woven with shifting patterns—geometric stars that seem to pulse in rhythm with the plaza’s heartbeat. She holds a basket brimming with indigo fruits, their skins shimmering with iridescent flecks. When she meets my gaze, her expression blooms with gentle curiosity, and she extends one of the fruits in offering.

I reach out, careful and reverent, and accept. She speaks—a rippling, lilting phrase that I cannot decipher, but the cadence is kind, like the hush of wind through waving grass. Desperate to bridge the void between us, I press my palm to my heart and offer my strangest, widest smile.

Understanding ignites in her eyes. She mimics my motion, laughter spilling from her lips like chimes. She picks up another fruit and mimics exaggerated chewing, then points at a stall nearby where the vendor stirs a pot of liquid gold. A small group gathers, their faces open and animated, their gestures painting the story of this place in the air—a living tapestry woven not in words, but in motion, touch, and laughter.

I join the dance of their communication, discovering that survival here is found in the silent language that travels beneath speech: the sparkle of eyes, the kindness of a shared meal, the glory of a smile that says, in every tongue and none, “You are welcome, traveler, even in your lostness.”
