I am dreaming. You breathe in the warm, cinnamon-scented air of the Grand Mirror Hall, where walls of opalescent glass ripple like liquid light. Delegates in silken robes—once mortal enemies—sit around a floating obsidian table, its surface alive with drifting constellations. The chandelier overhead pulses softly, as if echoing the beating heart of the world itself.

As tensions rise during negotiations, you feel the temperature drop. A subtle hum vibrates through your bones. Across the table, the ambassador from the western territories drums ebony fingernails on the glass, each tap fracturing reality for an instant—cracks of violet lightning where time unravels. Torn between age-old grudges and the urgent need for peace, you close your eyes, summoning an inner calm you didn’t know you possessed.

When you open them again, the hall has shifted. The floor beneath you is no longer polished marble but a shallow sea of molten moonlight. Your footsteps send ripples of silver across the surface, and each ripple carries a memory—a childhood lullaby, a battlefield’s final scream, the laughter of old friends. All around the table, delegates feel it, too. Their postures soften. The ambassador from the northern isles lets his ebony fingers drift to his side.

Seizing the moment, you begin to speak: not in rigid protocol but in stories. You paint visions of sunlit orchards where former foes swing in hammocks together, of ruined battlements restored by shared labor, of a single dove that hatches from two fractured eggs. Your words blossom like midnight roses, petals unfolding in midair, drifting toward each delegate’s chest. Each petal lights a spark of compassion.

The humming fades. The obsidian table cools to smooth onyx. In place of rigid titles and ancient hostilities, there is only the quiet promise of collaboration. At the summit’s end, you and your erstwhile adversaries rise and clasp hands. The floating constellations within the table scatter into the sky above, birthing a new galaxy shaped like an olive branch—a testament that even the deepest divisions can bloom into unity in the boundless theater of a dream.
