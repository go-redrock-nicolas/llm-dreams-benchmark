I am dreaming. I'm walking through a labyrinth of shelves that stretch upwards endlessly, tower like ancient skyscrapers made of glass, each holding bottles of my favorite brand, "Starbeam Soda." Even in the dream, I remember how as a child, their ads promised a burst of cosmic energy with every sip, and I believed it. But now, the labels on these bottles are peeling, the once sparkly silver caps are rusty. When I crack one open, instead of a citrus-fizzy aroma, it smells like moldy paper and the hiss is more of a damp sigh.

Looking around, other passersby are robots with glowing screens on their chests, each robot's screen showing a live feed of a different brandâ€™s commercials. One shows "LumenFizzy," offering a "journey to the core of a candy comet" with every drink. Another robot shows "GlimmerPop" with "taste the northern lights." I want to stay loyal to Starbeam but the evidence piles up. A hologram of an old friend - my childhood self - appears, holding a pristine bottle. "It's okay to let go," they say, but their voice glitches like a bad signal. 

Suddenly the shelves start to tilt, the Starbeam bottles cascading down like a slow-motion avalanche of disappointment. I run, and the path splits: one way lit with bright neon signs of new brands promising wonders, the other dark but leading to a small, flickering lantern labeled in faded paint: "Starbeam's First Factory." Which do I choose?
