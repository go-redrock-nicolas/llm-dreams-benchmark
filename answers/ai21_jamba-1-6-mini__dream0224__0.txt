I am dreaming. As you navigate a kaleidoscope of realities, your senses become heightened in this dream. In one timeline, you see a vast, starry sky above you, with planets spinning delicately into existence like marbles rolling through the cosmos. Each planet is a unique world with its own atmosphere, landscapes, and inhabitants—alien beings with glowing eyes and iridescent scales.

In another flow of reality, you are underwater, surrounded by bioluminescent creatures flickering like tiny stars beneath the waves. The water is warm and thick, rich with the salty tang of the sea, and the currents carry you effortlessly through an underwater garden teeming with life. A massive, majestic creature glides past you, its motions slow and hypnotic, as coral reefs bloom like neon fireworks.

Yet another branching path takes you above the clouds, into a world where the wind is a living thing, and the air is thick with the scent of blooming flowers. The clouds part to reveal crystalline cities floating among the air, filled with beings of pure light who use strands of arcing electricity to communicate—like a living circuit board that spans the sky.

You feel yourself moving through these worlds, an ethereal presence, as your consciousness barely grazes the edges of each life. You watch how the smallest choices ripple outward, changing everything—forever.
