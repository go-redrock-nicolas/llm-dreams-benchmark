I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, but the ground beneath your feet is not ground at all—it’s a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a different version of the room you were just in, or maybe a room you’ve never seen. A clock ticks backward on the wall, its hands melting like candle wax. You’re in an office, but not *your* office. The walls are made of liquid glass, and outside, the sky pulses with auroras that hum in dissonant chords.  

Two colleagues—**Mara**, her hair a storm of static, and **Jarek**, his skin etched with glowing circuit-board veins—are locked in a duel of words. Their voices crackle like live wires. The project between them, *The Heartspire*, hangs in the air as a hologram: a towering structure meant to channel human emotion into energy, a bridge between feeling and matter. But now it flickers, its design split down the middle—a left half of baroque spirals, a right half of sterile, geometric lines.  

“You’re *ruining* it!” Mara hisses, her eyes twin supernovae. “The Heartspire needs *soul*! Without the curves, the resonance of *longing*, it’s just a battery!”  

“And your ‘soul’ is a *black hole*,” Jarek snaps, his fingers twitching like he’s coding in the air. “Efficiency matters! Sentiment collapses the waveform. We need precision!”  

The hologram shudders, emitting a low, keening wail. The mirrored floor fractures further, and in the cracks, you glimpse writhing shadows—memories, maybe, or regrets. They turn to you, their faces sharp with desperation.  

“You’re the arbiter,” Mara says, her voice softening to a blade’s edge. “You’ve always seen both sides. Who’s right?”  

But as you open your mouth, your throat fills with fireflies. Words dissolve into light. Your hands rise, trembling, and suddenly you’re *unspooling*—not unraveling, but expanding. Your fingers brush the walls and the room bends, folding into a vast amphitheater where the ceiling is a nebula birthing stars. The fireflies in your throat swarm outward, becoming a chorus of tiny, winged voices:  

**“Neither. Both. The truth is the wound between.”**  

Mara and Jarek freeze, their anger momentarily drowned in awe. You step forward, and with each stride, your shadow grows into a colossus, a being of liquid mercury and stardust. You pluck the hologram from the air and crush it in your palm. It doesn’t break—it *blooms*, reforming as a living tree whose roots are made of intertwined serpents and angels, its branches heavy with glowing fruit that pulse like hearts.  

“The Heartspire isn’t a choice,” you say, your voice echoing like a thousand languages at once. “It’s a scar. Where logic and longing collide. You build it by *fighting*, but you power it by *forgiving*.”  

The tree’s fruit begin to burst, scattering seeds that embed themselves in the mirrored floor. Where they land, the shards knit into eyes, ears, mouths—faces of people you’ve never met, yet somehow love. The room thrums with a new sound: a harmony of arguments, unresolved but resonant.  

Mara sinks to her knees, her static-hair softening into sunlight. Jarek’s circuits dim to a warm, golden hue. They look at each other, and for a heartbeat, their faces flicker—swap ages, genders, species. Twin halves of a whole.  

Then the dream collapses.  

You wake in your bed, the scent of ozone and jasmine lingering. On your desk, a single seed rests in a bowl of water, its surface etched with impossible constellations. You know, without knowing, that the argument at work today will still rage—but now, you’ll carry the taste of fireflies, and the certainty that the deepest truths are never settled. They’re *sung*.
