I am dreaming. At first, there is only the wind—cold and whispering—carrying the scent of something ancient, like damp parchment and burning thyme. The ground beneath me is neither solid nor liquid, but something shifting, something that breathes. My feet sink slightly with each step, not into mud, but into the edge of possibility itself.  

I stand before a vast, luminous door, though *door* might not be the right word. It is more like a tear in the fabric of the world—a shimmering veil suspended in the air. The edges ripple like water, flecked with silver and indigo. Symbols flicker across its surface, changing each time I blink: a writhing serpent, an open eye, a key melting into smoke. My mind struggles to grasp them, to pin them down, but they dissolve the instant I think I understand.  

A voice—soft, genderless—humming just beyond hearing, says, *"The door is only a mystery if you ask it to be."*  

I reach forward. My fingers hesitate, trembling. The need to *know* what’s on the other side rises like a wave—**What will happen? What if it’s terrible? What if it’s sublime?**—and yet, beneath the fear, something deeper stirs. A quiet thrill. A willingness to step without answers.  

The moment I surrender the demand for certainty, the door sighs open like a lover’s lips.  

Beyond it, there is no landscape, no tunnel, no divine light—only an endless, pulsing dark, rich as velvet, alive with unseen motion. And then I realize: I am not looking into the dark. **The dark is looking back.**  

It gazes into me, unblinking, unafraid. And I—  

I let it.  

The moment stretches, collapses. I wake with the taste of starlight on my tongue and the scent of rain that has not yet fallen.
