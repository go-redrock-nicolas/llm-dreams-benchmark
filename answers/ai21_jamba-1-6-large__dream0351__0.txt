I am dreaming. As lightning flashes through the massive skylights above, you find yourself in a grand and eerie library. Massive shelves of ancient, dusty books stretch up to dizzying heights, vanishing into the shadows far above. You can hear whispers echoing faintly in the distance, but the voices seem to come from no discernible source. The air smells faintly of old parchment and faint spice. 

The polished wooden floors feel strangely warm beneath your bare feet as you walk hesitantly down a narrow aisle, your fingers trailing along the spines of countless books. Each one feels soft and worn, as if it has been read and loved a thousand times. Some of their titles are in languages you don't recognize, while others are in jagged, curling scripts that seem to move when you glance away. Eager to read a book, you reach for one, but as your hand closes on it, your fingers sink through the cover and pages as though they were an illusion.

You pull your hand back in surprise, and the book vanishes with a quiet, sinister laugh that makes you shiver. 

“Why are you here?” a voice suddenly whispers from all around, like a shadow of sound. You spin around, but there’s no one behind you. The aisles stretch endlessly into the darkness. You can feel your heart hammering in your chest as the shadows around you shift and move unnaturally. “This place is forbidden. Don’t you know? You don’t belong here.” The voice grows sharper, harsher, like a command. "Go, before it's too late."

A chill runs down your spine. You can feel a strange energy pulsating beneath your feet, as if the floor itself was alive. For a moment, everything is quiet, eerily still. Then, without warning, the room begins to shake. Books tumble from the towering shelves, crashing to the floor, their pages fluttering wildly. Dust explodes into the air, filling your lungs with a suffocating cloud. You crouch on the ground, coughing, shielding your head as the chaos grows louder; the books begin to scream, their cries sharp and piercing, blending with the sound of shattering glass and thunder outside.

And then—everything stops. The library is silent again. Your hands are shaking as you cautiously stand, brushing the dust from your clothes. You look around, blinking away droplets of sweat that mix with the dust in the air. You sense that something or someone is watching you, waiting for you to make a mistake. Behind you, faintly, you hear the sound of footsteps. Deliberate. Slow. Coming closer. Closer. Each step creaks against the wooden floor like a warning. 

You force yourself to turn.

Standing at the other end of the aisle, barely visible through the haze, is a figure draped in robes that seem to move even though there’s no wind. Dark, shifting shadows cling to their form, whispering and twisting like serpents. Their face is hidden beneath a hood that seems to swallow all light, and as they step toward you, the ground beneath their feet blackens, as though singed by some unseen fire.

"You have entered the domain of the lost," they rasp, and their voice is a harsh, cracked whisper. "This is where stories go to die. Stories that should never have been. And you"—their shadowy hand reaches toward you, embers of a strange fire flickering in their palm—"you're not supposed to be here."

You want to run, but your feet feel rooted to the spot, as though an invisible force is holding you in place. Your voice cracks as you try to speak. "What do you want from me?"

The figure's hand hovers inches away, its smoky fingers curling as though ready to snatch something unseen. "Don't you see?" the voice purrs. "This place is yours, but not yet. You must leave."

Without warning, the figure lunges forward, their hand outstretched, but instead of grabbing you, their fingers dig into the empty air beside you. With a violent wrench, they tear something from reality itself. A scream echoes through the library, but this time it's yours.

You jolt awake, gasping, the echo of that terrifying scream still ringing in your ears, fading into nothingness like a forgotten memory.
