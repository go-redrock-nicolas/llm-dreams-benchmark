I am dreaming. The revelation sits heavy in my mind like a stone at the bottom of a murky lake. I wander through familiar streets that seem strangely elongated, buildings stretching impossibly tall against a twilight sky streaked with ribbons of violet and amber. The knowledge I possess burns within me—a terrible truth about someone I love dearly. 

They move through the dreamscape beside me, laughing and talking, their face occasionally shifting between perfect clarity and watercolor softness. Their joy is genuine, unmarred by what I know. Their future plans, shared with such enthusiasm, are built upon a foundation that would crumble if I spoke what I've learned.

Every word they speak seems to echo and distort as my consciousness splits between listening and guarding this secret. When they touch my arm, asking if I'm alright, my skin feels both numb and hypersensitive.

We pass reflective surfaces—shop windows, puddles, mirrors in strange places—and in each one, I see myself carrying this burden like a physical weight, my dream-self hunched slightly while they stand tall, unburdened.

The dream shifts, and we're suddenly in a garden where the flowers whisper contradictory advice: "Tell the truth," hiss the roses with their thorns. "Protect them from pain," murmur the gentle lavender. I reach to touch a blossom and it dissolves into butterflies that spell out words I can't quite read before they scatter.

Time stretches and contracts. I feel trapped between compassion and honesty, protection and betrayal, watching their innocent happiness while knowing what waits beneath the surface of their reality. The dream offers no resolution, only the constant tension of this moral weight pressing against my chest as the sky darkens further and stars begin to form patterns that look almost like teardrops.
