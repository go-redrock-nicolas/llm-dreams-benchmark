I am dreaming. You drift into sleep as though sinking through warm ink, and the night unfurls a stage around you— a city made entirely of stained-glass towers, each pane trembling with starlight that pulses like a heartbeat. The air hums with a low, melodic thrum, the kind that blurs the line between sound and color; every breath tastes faintly of lilac and electricity.

You begin to wander.

Your boots echo on streets of mirror-smooth obsidian. Everywhere, reflections follow you—not just yours, but almost-yours, copies that lag a half-second behind, their smiles just a shade too wide. Whenever you pause, they pause; whenever you turn, they turn—yet their eyes never quite align, as if someone backstage is tugging at unseen strings.

In the distance, a ferris wheel stitched from moonlight whirls without passengers, its carriages open like waiting hands. Beneath it stands someone familiar: the person whose laughter used to feel like sunlight on your skin. Tonight, they beckon with a gentle curve of their fingers, radiating warmth that tugs at your chest. You step closer, but the closer you come, the heavier the gravity becomes, pulling at your ankles, whispering stay small, stay soft, stay silent.

Between you and them, nearly invisible, stretch silken threads—gossamer-thin, glinting silver in the starlight. They anchor at your wrists, your spine, the curve of your throat, leading back to that figure like the rigging of a puppet. Every time you exhale, the threads tighten imperceptibly, guiding your shoulders inward, coaxing you to tilt your head in acquiescence.

A flicker of realization sparks: this is coercion rendered beautiful, a lullaby woven out of control.

You lift a hand, expecting to touch one of the threads. Instead, an obsidian knife appears in your palm—no weight, but impossibly sharp. The city hushes, as though holding its breath to see what you will do.

Cutting the first thread feels like slicing through static on an old radio: a brittle crackle in the air, then silence. With each thread severed, the gravity lightens. Your posture lengthens, lungs expand, voice gathers like storm clouds at the back of your throat.

When you reach the final thread—anchored right at your heart—you pause. The familiar figure ahead looks suddenly unsure, their outstretched hand trembling. You meet their gaze and speak, and your words roll out as thunder:

“I will not dance by strings you hide behind kindness. I will meet you eye to eye, or not at all.”

The knife dissolves into motes of light. The last thread evaporates. Instantaneously, the stained-glass towers brighten, each pane filling with new colors—amber courage, cerulean clarity, vermilion self-respect. The reflections that once shadowed you lift their chins, proud and free, then quietly step back into mirrors where they belong.

The ferris wheel slows, its moonlit carriages clicking into stillness. The other person lowers their hand. For a heartbeat, sorrow mist-clouds their features, but honesty has its own gravitational field; they can choose to step into it, or drift away. Either way, you stand tall.

You turn from the plaza and find a stairway of clear quartz spiraling upward. Each step is engraved with a single word of intention—trust, boundary, dialogue, dignity—glowing faintly beneath your tread. You ascend until the city shrinks to a mosaic of glimmering shards below, and dawn’s first gold threads the horizon.

At the summit, a door of plain cedar awaits. You push it open and spill into waking.

Back in your bed, heart steady, you remember: 

1. Invisible threads can slip around you in daylight just as easily as in dreams.  
2. The knife was only a symbol; your real blade is clear communication—assertive, compassionate, unwavering.  
3. You owe your dance to no puppeteer, however softly they sing.

Morning light paints the walls. You rise knowing the conversation ahead may quiver like cut glass, but the city inside you now stands on sturdier foundations, and your voice is already humming with sunrise.
