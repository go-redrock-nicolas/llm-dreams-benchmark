I am dreaming. In the dream, I find myself standing at the threshold between two worlds. Behind me, a city of glass and sharp angles pulses with a feverish energy—skyscrapers that seem to breathe, their windows flashing with neural patterns of light. I can feel the tension of that place still clinging to my skin like static electricity.

Before me stretches an ancient forest where trees grow in impossible spirals, their bark inscribed with mathematical equations that slowly shift and solve themselves. The air here tastes like copper and honey, and each breath fills my lungs with a peculiar warmth that spreads through my chest.

I become aware of a weight in my abdomen—a physical manifestation of anxiety that has crystallized into something tangible. Looking down, I see faint blue lines beneath my skin, mapping the pathways of worry through my body. They pulse in rhythm with my racing thoughts about deadlines, responsibilities, and fears.

A deer approaches from between the spiral trees. Its antlers are branching constellations, and its eyes reflect not my face but scenes from my childhood. It speaks without sound: "Your body remembers what your mind tries to forget."

The creature leads me to a clearing where the ground is covered in thousands of tiny mirrors. As I step onto them, they don't break but ripple like water. Each ripple travels outward, changing color as it moves—from the angry red of inflammation to the dull gray of fatigue to the sharp yellow of panic.

I kneel and place my hands on the mirror-ground. The crystallized anxiety begins to dissolve, transforming into luminescent butterflies that emerge from under my skin. Each carries away a fragment of tension, but leaves behind a small mark—a reminder that healing isn't about erasing but transforming.

The sky above shifts from twilight to dawn, and raindrops begin to fall—each one containing a memory of laughter. Where they touch my skin, muscles unknot themselves, and the blue pathways fade.

"Balance," whispers the forest itself, "is not the absence of storm but the strength to bend without breaking."

I awaken with the taste of copper and honey still on my tongue, and the curious sensation that my cells remember the dream even if my waking mind begins to forget.
