I am dreaming. I drift through a city of suspended moments, where buildings breathe and time flows like honey. The streets beneath me are rivers of cobalt memories, each stone a forgotten conversation. I notice people walking backward, their footprints filling with luminescent water that reflects not their faces but their deepest thoughts.

The sky isn't above but around me—a dome of perpetually shifting twilight where stars emerge and dissolve like ideas. I reach out to touch one and it sings in a voice I recognize as my own from childhood.

I follow a spectral fox with eyes like ancient amber. It leads me to a library where books read themselves aloud in whispers, their pages turning in sync with my heartbeat. Each story begins with my name but ends with different possibilities—lives I might have lived.

A staircase made of piano keys spirals upward when I step on them, each note vibrating through my body with memories that aren't quite mine. At the top, a door made of fog opens to reveal an ocean suspended in mid-wave, frozen in a moment of perfect potential energy.

When I touch the water, it shatters into thousands of crystal butterflies that reassemble into the face of someone I've never met but somehow deeply miss. They speak in colors rather than words, painting emotions across my understanding that have no names in waking language.

As the dream begins to dissolve, I realize my hands have been writing this entire time on paper made of light, documenting a truth I'll struggle to remember upon waking—something fundamental about the nature of connection, about how we are all echoes of each other's dreams.
