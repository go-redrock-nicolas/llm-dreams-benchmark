I am dreaming. Deep in the shifting realms of slumber, I find myself standing at the edge of an iridescent forest. The trees tower impossibly high, their bark pulsing with veins of bioluminescent blue that syncs with my heartbeat. Each leaf is translucent crystal, tinkling like wind chimes when the warm breeze passes through.

The path beneath my feet transforms with each step—sometimes cobblestone, sometimes flowing water that somehow supports my weight, sometimes a ribbon of pure starlight. I'm drawn forward by a melody that seems half-remembered, as if from a childhood I never actually lived.

As I venture deeper, the forest opens to reveal a vast clearing where gravity seems optional. Islands of earth float at various heights, connected by bridges made of intertwining vines and morning mist. On each island, impossible structures stand—buildings whose architecture defies physics, with staircases that loop in Möbius strips and doors that open to reveal themselves.

The sky above isn't sky at all, but an ocean inverted, with fish and cetacean creatures swimming lazily above my head. Occasionally, one dips down close enough that I could touch it, leaving behind a trail of glittering particles that rain down and dissolve into perfumed light.

I encounter beings here—neither human nor animal, but something beautifully in-between. They communicate in colors that bloom from their fingertips and emotions I can taste on my tongue. One approaches, pressing something into my hand: a seed that pulses with warmth. When I look into its center, I see entire galaxies being born and dying in hypnotic cycles.

Time feels stretched and folded here. Moments expand into eternities and centuries compress into heartbeats. I realize I've always been here and will always be here, even as I know I'm elsewhere too.

The dream begins to shift, the edges softening as consciousness tugs gently at my mind, but the sensation remains—of boundless wonder in a universe where imagination is the only natural law that cannot be broken.
