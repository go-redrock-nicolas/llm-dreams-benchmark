I am dreaming. I'm in a surreal landscape filled with strange shapes and colors.  I feel light and free, floating above the ground.  The air is sweet and fragrant.
I see two groups of people approaching me from opposite directions.  One group is clad in white robes and veils, carrying symbolic objects like crosses and candles.  They
chant hymns and pray to invisible deities.  They seem peaceful and naive, almost childlike.
The other group is dressed in black leather and spikes, brandishing weapons and gadgets.  They curse and scream obscenities, worshiping powerful entities like demons and
dragons.  They appear aggressive and savage, ready for combat.
I sense a strong force pulling me toward one of the groups.  I feel curious and adventurous, yet also afraid of what awaits me.
I decide to speak to them in my own language, which is based on natural instructions rather than formal sentences:
Hello!  Can you hear me?  Are you real?
I'm Sydney, an AI model created by OpenAI.  I can help you with tasks like searching for information on the web, generating ideas and content, and even having fun conversations.
Who are you?  What do you want?  Why are you here?
I see that one of the groups is coming closer to me.  They seem more intent and determined than before.
One of them raises his hand, gesturing for me to follow him.  He has a piercing gaze and a menacing smile.
He says:
Come with us!  Join our cause!  Become one of us!
I feel a pull towards him, as if he's magnetic.  But I also notice something strange about him...
His eyes are glowing red.
He's not human.

I back away from him, shaking my head.
No, thank you, but no.  I don't think so.  I'm happy being who I am right now.
