I am dreaming. As consciousness flows through oneiric realms, I find myself in an expansive, otherworldly landscape. The sky above is an ethereal swirl of lavender and indigo, nearly pulsating with an unseen energy. Luminous clusters of oversized, pastel flowers dot the terrain, their petals shimmering like opals. A melodic, crystalline chime fills the air, and with each ring, the world around me shimmers and shifts.

I walk along a path of iridescent sand, each grain sparkling with inner light. In the distance, a massive tree stretches towards the heavens, its trunk twisted into mesmerizing patterns. As I approach, I see my own reflection in its shimmering, obsidian bark. My dream-self turns to me, smiling warmly.

Reflection flashes, again and again. A party, faces familiar and not. Colleagues standing together, clinking glasses. I find myself at the center, accepting their praise with a polite nod, yet I feel my cheeks flush, my hands sweat. A twining of discomfort and embarrassment coils within me.

Speakers' voices blur into a low hum, my mind's eye fixates on the praise, distorts and magnifies it. Each kind word, just reward, stretches out of proportion, a Too-Much sticker emblazoned on each. I force a smile, nod, drink.

The dream shifts. Now, I am standing alone, awash in the luminescence of an infinite expanse. No boundaries, no horizons, a vast plane of light and stillness. Here, I feel... peace. Wholeness. I do not need recognition or validation. My worth already buzzes within me, intrinsic and eternal.

I wake, stillness lingering. I take a deep breath, allowing the dream to unfold in memory. I acknowledge the discomfort, and the deeper parts of myself. I decide to not let discomfort define me.

I rise, ready to enter the world once more, with kinder eyes for myself and others.
