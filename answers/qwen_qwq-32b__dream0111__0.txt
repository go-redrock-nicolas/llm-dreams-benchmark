I am dreaming. The air in the operating room is electric, charged with a silence so thick it hums. My hands, hovering above the surgical tray, feel both weightless and monumental. The patient’s face is obscured by a silver drape, but I can see the faint rise and fall of their chest beneath, like a distant ocean wave trapped under glass. The scalpel glints in the cold LED light overhead—its edge a sliver of starlight frozen mid-fall. I grip it, the metal biting into my palm, and suddenly, the walls of the hospital dissolve.

Now I’m floating in an infinite library, each shelf towering above me like redwood trees, their spines glowing with titles in alien scripts. The scalpel morphs into a key, and I realize this is a labyrinth of forgotten knowledge. Somewhere, a book thuds closed with a sound like a heartbeat. I sprint down aisles lined with star charts and grimoires, my breath ragged. The walls rearrange themselves, and I stumble, the key slipping from my fingers. It plunges into a pool of liquid shadow, but instead of sinking, it ignites—a blue flame that sings a lullaby from childhood.

The flame lifts me, and I’m back in the OR, scalpel now a silver feather against the patient’s skin. My hands hover, not trembling anymore but vibrating with the memories of every forgotten surgeon who ever failed, every pioneer whose experiments led to disaster. The first incision. The skin parts not with a slice, but a whisper, unfurling like parchment revealing a map stained with bioluminescent veins. Beneath, instead of organs, I find a constellation—living, pulsing stars arranged as the patient’s memories: a childhood summer cabin sparking in Cygnus’s wing, a first love dissolved into cosmic dust, their greatest regret a dying quasar.

My scalpel—no, a stargate remote—must navigate this cosmos without severing the wrong star. Too close to the trauma, and the whole system goes supernova. I drift closer, realizing each nerve is a ley line, every vessel a river of liquid time. The tumor isn’t flesh; it’s a black hole consuming their future years, its event horizon a ravenous mouth sucking in unborn moments. My mind races, not to operate but to negotiate: I offer my own forgotten memories—a decade’s worth of small kindnesses, the scent of rain on hotphalt—through the scalpel’s tip. The void hungers, then hesitates.

In the pause, I twist—a pirouette of precision—and the scalpel becomes a bridge between worlds. The black hole’s maw snaps shut, the stolen time cascading back in emerald waves. The patient’s chest reknits, flesh welding with a sound like a symphony’s crescendo. I wake gasping, the OR sterile again, yet everything’s changed. The monitor beeps in a rhythm unfamiliar, faster, wilder. I lift my hands and see stardust clinging to my fingertips… and beneath the surgical lights, the patient’s eyes flutter open.
