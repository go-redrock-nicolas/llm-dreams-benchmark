I am dreaming. I find myself adrift in a sky stitched with threads of twilight—neither day nor night, but teetering between two worlds, like the breath caught between a sigh and a gasp. Beneath my bare feet, the earth dissolves into a mosaic of glassy waters, mirror-smooth, refracting constellations that shouldn’t exist—formed not from stars, but from silent music notes floating in slow, aching arcs across the heavens. This realm is not built on logic. It is stitched from longing.

Before me, a path spirals upward, crafted from fallen leaves that whisper secrets in ancient tongues as I walk. It’s a slow, winding ascent, and around me float dancers made of smoke and moonlight, neither male nor female, but a serene blending—an eternal celebration of what lies beyond dualities. They beckon me forward with knowing smiles, eyes alight with flickers of unspoken stories.

At the heart of the dream is a tower—a structure not born of stone or steel, but of frozen music. The material shimmers like liquid onyx turned to shadow. It sings faintly, its tune just beneath the edge of hearing, perfectly balanced between sorrow and infinite joy. At the tower’s base, a circle of faceless elders, cloaked in robes of rain and rust, murmur among themselves. Their concern is palpable. They do not believe I am ready. They don’t think I should try.

"Such a path leads only to forgetting," they chant in a chorus that hums through the trees. "To madness. To exile."

But the music that calls from the tower is sacred to me—it eggs me forward like a memory you cannot place but long to reclaim. The notes lift me as if carried on the breath of the world's oldest secret. I feel the pull deep in my marrow, a magnetic pull toward…

I don't know. Truth? Expression? Awakening?

At the tower’s summit, I know I will find something more than myself—something long buried and brilliant, perhaps incomprehensible. But in my chest burns a singular certainty: this madness, this path ignored by reason and whispered warnings, sings of my authentic essence, untouched and unashamed.

The wind rises. The tower trembles but does not fall. I step forward, no longer afraid. The elders fade into mist. This is no waste of time. This is my fire, kindled where the world ran cold. An urgent, wonderful, forbidden dream I alone dare to chase.
