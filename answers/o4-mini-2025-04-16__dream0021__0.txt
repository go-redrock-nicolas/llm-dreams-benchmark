I am dreaming. You stand on a gleaming platform of living crystal, its facets pulsing beneath your feet like a heartbeat. All around you, the cavernous arena stretches into impossible heights—arches of molten gold entwined with drifting ribbons of starlight, walls carved from midnight-black obsidian that reflect the crowd in fractal shards. Above, twin moons hover in a violet sky, periodically eclipsing each other and bathing the world in ghostly half-light. A scent of ozone and jasmine winds through the air, and distant thunder—like the drumbeat of a colossal beast—echoes through the stands.

Your teammates cluster just behind you, their faces a mixture of fierce confidence and raw hope. You feel their warmth—familiar hearts beating in unison—and for a moment, the roar of the audience dims into a soft chorus, as if the universe is holding its breath. Across the arena floor, your seasoned opponents stand ready: giants clad in armor carved from living fossils, their eyes glowing with aeons of experience. Where they tower in imposing strength, you counter with agility born of every hidden corner of your mind.

As all eyes turn to you, you feel time slow. Each breath stretches into a ribbon of awareness. Your right hand tingles with electric energy, as though the very spark of creation has settled under your skin. The world’s colors sharpen: the crystalline floor refracts your reflection into a thousand possible selves, each waiting to dance with destiny. You realize you are both challenger and conductor here—you alone can orchestrate the next move.

A hush falls. Then, with a flick of your wrist, the arena transforms: immense pillars of light rise from the floor in spiraling columns, inscribed with ancient runes that shimmer like fireflies. They part like a gateway—and through them steps a colossal, winged sentinel, its eyes the color of molten bronze. It lets loose a thunderous cry, and the crowd surges again, an ocean of fervor. Your heart pounds, but beneath the tremor resides a calm certainty: you were born for this moment.

You breathe deep, tasting courage on your tongue, and you step forward across the crystalline stage. With each stride, the runes beneath your feet glow in rhythm, as if celebrating your passage. Opponents roar their challenge, but your voice rises above it, clear and unwavering. You raise your hand and call upon the hidden currents of the dream—shaping gravity, calling forth ephemeral wings of light, weaving illusions of impossible geometry. The arena bends to your will. And in that electric instant, you realize that experience is no match for the boundless imagination pulsing through your veins.
