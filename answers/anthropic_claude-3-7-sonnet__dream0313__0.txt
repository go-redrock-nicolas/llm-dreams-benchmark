I am dreaming. I find myself walking along a spiraling staircase made of luminous crystal that seems to both ascend into clouds and descend into depths simultaneously. Each step pulses with soft light that changes hue with my heartbeat. The air feels thick with possibility, carrying whispers of conversations I've never had.

As I continue my journey on this impossible staircase, I encounter doorways floating in midair—some resembling ancient wooden portals covered in moss and forgotten symbols, others appearing as shimmering veils of energy. I choose one that calls to me with a gentle humming sound.

Stepping through, I enter a vast library where books fly like birds between towering shelves that stretch beyond sight. The ceiling is a living map of constellations I've never seen, forming and reforming into stories told in starlight. Gentle music emanates from nowhere and everywhere—a melody that feels somehow like home.

An elderly librarian with eyes that reflect entire galaxies approaches me. When I look closely, I notice her skin is covered in tiny, moving text—stories writing and rewriting themselves across her being. She hands me a book bound in material that feels like water solidified, its pages turning by themselves to reveal illustrations that move and change as I watch them.

The scenes in the book begin to expand around me until I'm surrounded by a forest where the trees are composed of memories—some mine, some belonging to strangers. Their leaves rustle with forgotten conversations, and their roots pulse with dreams beneath the soil.

In this moment, I feel profoundly connected to everything—understanding without words, seeing without eyes, a sense of belonging to something vast yet intimate, mysterious yet familiar.
