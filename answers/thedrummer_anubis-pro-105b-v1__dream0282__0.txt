I am dreaming. "Your mind has sunk deeply into a dream state, allowing your imagination to run wild and create a vibrant, otherworldly landscape.

In this dream, you are a secluded beach, the warm sand gently caressing your feet as a latte-colored wave-long brunch of [special effects/sketchup/other incredible] ("X") glimmer on the horizon.

The sky above isn't an array of pinks and purples, but rather a canvas of ever-changing hues-each swell and expanse only amplifying the ethereal beauty that surrounds you. Those colors slide into one another like paint sliding across a wet palette in syncopated rhythm, creating an mesmerizing visual effect that draws you in and takes your breath away.

A family of wild horses is galloping along the shore, their hooves leaving tiny footprints where waves should be. Of course, logically they shouldn't be able to run land on the waves, but in the odd logic of dreams, it ends up looking graceful anyhow.

Your mind glows with thoughts of philanthropy and altruism, but not without your usual cynical take on them. You are pondering the idea that real charitable acts can never be pure, that there is always an element of self to them - be it material gain, appreciation, or just warm fuzzy feelings. Perhaps people only indulge in them to feed these ulterior drives.

A caballo (courtesy of a lucid dreaming) trots up to you, a multicolored snout licked a pat over, drawn to the river of cynicism flowing through your mind. Is a partial miraculous ? 

Wait a minute- when your thoughts are put to paper, or at least the side of the house that is spelling "cutting knowledge", waning desire knows what is happening anyways
