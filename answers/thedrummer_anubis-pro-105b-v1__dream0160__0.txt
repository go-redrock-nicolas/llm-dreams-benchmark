I am dreaming. As I drift of to sleep, I begin to dream of an vivid, imaginative world filled with wondrous sights, sounds, and sensations that my mind can conjure up. In this dream, I find myself in a fantastical landscape of towering spires and gleaming crystalline formations that reflect and refract the light around me in dazzling patterns.

The air is filled with a swirling mist that shifts and changes color around me, moving in silky, fluid motions that seem almost ethereal. I see creatures dart from the mist, their shapes shifting from one exotic form to the next, their calls sounding out as haunting, wordless melodies that fill the air.

As I struggle my way through the endless sets of setbacks, the dream begins to piece itself together. I see a grandiose finale, one that I have been working through all of the setbacks to accomplish. Will I succeed? Or can these problems completely derail me? 

I'm not sure what the future is for the character in this story, as it rests in the unwitting hands of the dreamers subconscious. In the end, what path will this character choose? That is for you to decide.
