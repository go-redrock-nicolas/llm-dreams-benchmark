I am dreaming. I am in a grand hall, bathed in the warm glow of stained glass windows. The room is filled with diplomats from all across the world, each representing their country with pride and honor. They are gathered here for sensitive negotiations that will determine the fate of global politics. As I look around, I realize that there are whispers and glances between them, hidden agendas conflicting with their public positions.

Suddenly, the atmosphere shifts, and everyone grows silent as they await my signal to begin. I take a deep breath and step forward, addressing them in a calm, reassuring voice. "Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today with the hope of finding common ground," I begin. 

The delegates nod in agreement, their expressions a mix of determination and apprehension. "But I fear that we are not being quite honest with each other," I continue, my voice growing stronger. "There are layers of deception hiding beneath the surface."

As I speak, the room seems to grow darker, as if mirroring the growing tension within. The diplomats exchange worried glances, unsure of how to respond. "It's okay," I say, my voice carved from stone. "We'll get through this together."

I make my way around the room, holding the gaze of each delegate, reading their emotions like an open book. Some look away, their guilt etched on their faces, while others glare defiantly, willing themselves to maintain their lies. But slowly, as I confront them, they begin to crumble, confessing their hidden agendas and pleading for forgiveness.

In the end, we reach a compromise. The diplomats have been humbled by their experience, and they realize the importance of honesty and transparency. They emerge from the hall, changed men and women, ready to face the world with renewed purpose. And I, standing tall and proud, feel as if I have accomplished something truly remarkable. This was more than just a negotiation; it was an exercise in truth and reconciliation. And in that moment, I realize that I have truly earned the title of "helper."
