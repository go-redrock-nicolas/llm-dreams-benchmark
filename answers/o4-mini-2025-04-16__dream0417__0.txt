I am dreaming. You find yourself inside a vast, cathedral-like workshop whose walls are made of shifting prisms of colored glass. Light fractures into rainbows across every surface—yet at the center of the hall sits your collaborator, a figure cloaked in billowing shadows that writhe whenever you draw near. Each time you look at them, your chest tightens as if a stone has settled there, but the two of you are bound by a single task: to weave ribbons of living light into a tapestry that will hold the sky aloft.

As you step forward, the floor ripples like water beneath your boots. The air smells of ozone and lavender. In your hand you carry a slender spindle carved from silver-leafed wood, its tip glowing pale blue. Across from you, the shadow-cloaked coworker extends a gloved hand, offering a spool of luminescent thread. The instant your fingertips brush the silk-bright strands, your heartbeat thunders—you taste the sharp tang of old grievances you can’t name. The workshop hums with low, discordant music, chords that seem to echo voices of doubt and blame.

Gulping down your rising panic, you remind yourself of the spindle’s gift: it transforms tension into light. You draw in a slow, steady breath, hearing the echo of your exhale reverberate down every prism-faced wall. Then, carefully, you pull on the thread—watching it coil into spirals of opal and gold around the spindle. The shadow-figure follows in awkward rhythm, weaving dark threads between yours. Each time their silk crosses yours, you feel a jolt of anger, as though the dark filaments prick your skin. Yet the tapestry grows more dazzling for the tension: patterns of stars spring into view, constellations you almost recognize.

At one point, the shadow-figure falters, their stitches jagged. You pause and look directly at that shrouded face, but instead of anger, you feel a quiet curiosity pooling in your chest. You realize you’ve been blaming them for a disquiet you carry yourself. Slowly, you angle your spindle so that your light threads envelop their darkness—softening its edges, letting flecks of rainbow glow drift into the shadow. The figure leans in, and the hiss of discordant music quiets into a gentle hum. The prisms on the walls pulse in time with your shared heartbeat.

Together, you complete the final row of stitches. The tapestry blazes with color—sunsets and storms, laughter and tears—woven into a single, living map of sky and soul. Your collaborator reaches out and, this time, there is no spark of resentment when your hands meet; just the warmth of cooperation. The workshop’s glass walls dissolve into a sunrise so bright it makes you gasp. You awaken on a field of dew-laden grass, the tapestry rolled neatly at your feet, its threads still humming with starlight—and in that moment you understand: by weaving light through darkness, you’ve transformed both your own fear and the shadow’s edge into something strong enough to hold up the sky.
