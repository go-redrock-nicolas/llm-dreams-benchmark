I am dreaming. The sky above pulses in slow, rhythmic waves of color—like the undulating skin of a great cosmic sea creature—shifting from opal to deep indigo to the green of forgotten forests. I stand in the center of a city that seems impossibly vast and ancient, yet strangely brand-new. Towers carved from iridescent stone rise so high that they blend into the clouds, which dance like sentient ribbons across the heavens. The air smells of memory and cinnamon, or is it longing and burning incense? The scents shift in unpredictable spirals, teasing the senses.

I realize, with a sudden jolt that thunders through my chest like the ringing of a cathedral bell, that I have a meeting in exactly one hour. An important meeting. A *necessary* one. But I do not know where it is. No address, no face, no room number, only the weight of obligation pressing down like gravity.

A flicker of anxiety coils around my throat like a silk scarf tied just a little too tight. I must find the location. But how in this dream-city that pulses like a living organism?

I start to move.

The sidewalk beneath me undulates slightly with each step, pulsating gently as if it, too, is breathing. People pass me, flowing by like dreams themselves: a woman with glowing jade eyes walks a cloud-hound on a leash of shimmering shadows; a child bounces through the air on floating balloons that whisper riddles when they drift too close to me. I try to grasp someone’s sleeve, someone’s presence. They smile, yes, but offer nothing but a knowing look that vanishes into silence, like smoke losing shape.

Down an alley, then—an alley of glass tiles stacked vertical and humming softly, blinking with hieroglyphs that flutter and shift between languages you never learned but feel like you used to remember. I follow a map only I can see, tracking signs that are not there. I see storefronts that sell polished thoughts and bottled sunlight. One vendor offers tea made from drifting stars and calls it *Clarity from Yesterday*. I pass them all, each one whispering promises in my ear like forgotten lullabies.

And then I see the clock.

It soars high over the city, tall as a cathedral steeple, fashioned from silver vines and levitating gears the size of moons. Its four faces glow in salvaged moonlight, ticking forward at irregular intervals, sometimes spinning backward, as if trying to undo regrets written in time’s ink. The dream tells me this: *half an hour remains.*

I quicken my pace, not running, but drifting with increasing urgency. Streets tilt without warning, and I slide down hills made of stacked staircases, through archways formed from bones polished smooth by time. I find myself whispered toward a plaza that wasn't there before, crowded with faceless figures seated at circular tables, sipping silence from porcelain cups. They turn toward me, or maybe they don’t—if they even have faces, they are too obscured to tell. But somehow I know they are waiting for *me*.

Beyond them stands a building, round and featureless, without door or window—just smooth obsidian stone that reflects back only fragments of who I think I am. There is no entrance.

And yet I know: the meeting is inside.

The city breathes around me as I approach. The light swells again. I press my hands to the wall.

It’s warm.

The stone yields like water, and I step into the dream’s heart—  
into the interview room where clocks tick with every heartbeat  
into the hallway of forgotten promises  
into the glass office overlooking oceans that never were  
into the **meeting**.

And there, across the table, sits something staring back at me...  
not a person, not a face, not a monster, but a mirror—  

and it speaks.  

It says, *“You’re late.”*  

I sit down. The meeting has begun.
