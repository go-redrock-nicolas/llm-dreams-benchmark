I am dreaming. As you begin, you feel the floor beneath your toes pulse like a living heartbeat, each thump resonating up your legs and into the core of your being. A spotlight blooms overhead—pale as moonlight, yet warm as a lover’s breath—and the air around you shimmers in iridescent waves. Your breath catches, but you draw in one slow, steady inhale, tasting the faint tang of ozone, like electricity stirring before a storm.  

In your hands rests the instrument you have mastered in thousands of secret rehearsals: a violin carved from driftwood and starlight, its surface alive with swirling constellations. As you lift the bow, the strings awaken with a soft glow, humming with anticipation. You place it beneath your chin, and the judges—tall silhouettes draped in robes of shifting color—lean forward, their faces half-hidden beneath luminous hoods. Their eyes gleam like polished amber, patient and inscrutable.  

Your first note unfurls like a ribbon of smoke, curling upward to greet the ceiling, where it blossoms into petals of sound. You follow with a trill so delicate it seems to coax a million fireflies into existence, each flickering in time with your heartbeat. The stage around you transforms: the dark floor melts away, revealing a lake of liquid glass that reflects galaxies drifting overhead. Cool mist rises around your ankles, and distant choirs murmur in harmonies you’ve known only in dreams.  

As you pour yourself into the passage you know by heart, your fears slip free, dissolving into the tide of melody. You feel every sinew and bone expand with purpose, as if your body itself has become the violin. Judges lean closer still, their amber eyes winking each time you arch the bow just so. The stage quivers, and arches of crystal sprout from the glassy lake, framing you in a cathedral built of pure sound.  

In the final measures, you summon all your courage into a single, soaring crescendo. The world tilts—stars fall like raindrops—and your bow cuts through the air in a brilliant arc of light. For a heartbeat there is perfect stillness: every being, every creature, every mote of dust holds its breath. Then the last note blossoms, echoing outward in shimmering ripples that set the cathedral ablaze with color.  

Silence follows, deeper than any darkness, and you stand, bow at your side, heart racing. The judges rise as one, their robes swaying like liquid dusk, and you feel the gentle brush of their gaze—like wings against your soul. In that suspended moment, you know your future has been written by the music you dared to dream.
