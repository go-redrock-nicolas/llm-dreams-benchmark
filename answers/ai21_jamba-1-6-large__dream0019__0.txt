I am dreaming. I find a door.

I have found a door.

I have found a magical door, and through its threshold I can create.

I have found a magical door that leads to a world where anything I imagine becomes real.

Through its threshold, I can create. Through its threshold, I can create a world where anything I imagine becomes real.

I step through the door.

I step through the threshold.

I step into the magical world.

In a flash, I decide to create a new world.

In an instant, I decide to create a new world.

In an instant, I decide to create a world where anything I imagine becomes real.

In an instant, I decide to create a world that I can create with my imagination.

I imagine a world where anything I imagine becomes real.

I imagine a world that I can create with my imagination.

I imagine a world where I am the ruler. 

I am the ruler of this world.

I am the ruler of this world where I can create with my imagination.

I am the ruler of this world where I can create anything that I imagine.

I imagine a world that I can create with my imagination, and I am the ruler of this world. 

I am the ruler of a world that I can create with my imagination.
