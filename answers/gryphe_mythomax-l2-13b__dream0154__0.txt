I am dreaming. In this reality where the flow of time is non-linear, I find myself in an unexpected situation. I am standing in a bustling city marketplace filled with colorful stalls selling exotic fruits and spices. The air is thick with the aromas of unfamiliar dishes being cooked and the noise of people haggling over goods. I feel the warmth of the sun on my face as I take in my surroundings.

However, there's something strange about this place. The people around me seem to know me, addressing me by name and sharing stories about their experiences with me. They mention events that haven't happened yet, describing them in vivid detail as if they had already occurred. Despite their tales being riddled with impossibilities, I find myself believing them wholeheartedly.

As I wander through the market, I spot a fortune-teller's booth. The woman, wearing an elaborate headdress, motions for me to sit down. Her eyes glint as she lays out a deck of tarot cards. She shuffles them expertly while murmuring cryptic phrases under her breath. She turns over the first card, revealing an image of a man riding a white horse. She tells me this man represents someone important in my life who will come to my aid when I need him most. I feel a sense of calm wash over me, as if this prediction were already true.

Suddenly, a vision flashes through my mind: a future version of myself, injured and weak, being carried by a man on a horse. My heart races as I realize this must be the person from the tarot card. I reach out to the fortune-teller, pleading with her for more information. She smiles enigmatically before vanishing into thin air.

Time seems to stand still as the vision persists, and I feel a desperate need to warn this person about their fate. With newfound determination, I step into the flow of time, moving forward to confront the man who holds the key to my salvation.
