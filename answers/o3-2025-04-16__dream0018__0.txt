I am dreaming. … patch the cracks before the roof of the universe caves in.

In the dream, I stand in the foyer of my house, though it is no ordinary foyer. The ceiling arches so high it vanishes into a sky swirling with slow-motion thunderheads, as if the weather has slipped inside. Rain drifts downward in glimmering curtains that never quite reach the floor, evaporating halfway like sighs. On the checkered tiles, I notice thin fissures that spiderweb out beneath my bare feet; every breath I take widens them, spreading a quiet groan through the beams overhead.

A single, flickering filament bulb swings on a cord—except it’s not a bulb at all but a miniature sun, a molten marble radiating amber light. When it sways, shadows shuffle like figures in a theater audience, muttering their concern. I feel the house trembling, timbers breathing too quickly, as though its heart has begun to stutter.

I know, with that strange dream-certainty, that if I don’t shore up the structure soon the walls will dissolve into a landslide of memories: photo frames liquefying into rivers, books turning into migrating birds, furniture dissolving into clouds of dust that whisper my name. Yet I possess no toolbox, no blueprint—only the shreds of intuition that a dreamer carries like loose feathers.

So I set out to scavenge.

First stop: the attic. I climb a staircase that unspools ahead of me like a roll of film, each step a still photograph of someplace I once loved—a beach at sunrise, a candlelit study, a playground after rain. At the top, instead of rafters, there is a vaulted library whose shelves are made of interlocking star charts. The spines of the books glow faintly, arranged not by author but by emotional temperature. I pull down a slim volume titled “Improvised Reinforcements” and when I open it, countless origami cranes spill out, each folded from blueprints of houses that never got built. The cranes flutter around my head, chirping in paper voices, and land on my shoulders like exotic epaulettes. They promise to help.

Next: the basement. I descend a ladder carved from the trunk of a single, living tree; sap beads on each rung like honeyed tears. Below, the basement is an underground cavern lit by bioluminescent moss that pulses emerald, breathing slowly, like an ocean tide turned inside out. The walls are studded with crystals shaped exactly like the fractures in the foundation above, as though the damage has been mirrored here in mineral. I tap one crystal and it rings with a bell-tone that reverberates through the stone, mapping out the fault lines in sound. The echo tells me which cracks matter most: the ones beneath the front door, under the piano, inside the wall where I used to measure my height as a child.

With these discoveries, I return to the main floor. The house continues to sway, a ship in stormy air. I fashion tools from what little I have:

• A hammer crafted from a stalactite wrapped in silk ribbon pulled off an old gift I never opened.  
• Nails forged of those attic crystals, which hum like tuning forks when I hold them to my ear.  
• A ladder woven by the origami cranes, each paper bird forming a rung, beating its wings as I climb.

Working quickly, I mend the first fissure. With every crystal nail I drive, a note rings out—A-sharp, D, E—and the cracks fuse in chords of light. The house seems to listen, wood grain shivering, and for a moment I sense gratitude radiating from the floorboards.

But one wound remains: a ragged gash down the central supporting beam, as if lightning struck from the inside. I press my palm to it and hear the creak of lonely years, the sigh of evenings when I ignored the groan of settling joists, too busy to notice. And something deeper—some sadness stored in the very grain. My improvised tools won’t mend this. I need something heart-stronger.

I turn to the shadows that have been watching, those silhouettes cast by the swinging sun-marble. Quietly, one of them peels away from the wall and steps forward. It is shaped like me but inscribed with constellations where its eyes should be. The shadow lifts its hand; from its palm unfurls a ribbon of darkness that smells of wet soil and old rain. It offers the ribbon wordlessly.

I take it, feeling the silk of midnight between my fingers. When I wrap it around the cracked beam, the darkness seeps into the wood, filling the split like river mud sealing a dam. A hush falls. The thunderheads in the ceiling pause their rolling, and the miniature sun steadies its swing. The house sighs—an exhale that smells of cedar closets and fresh paint—and the vibration stops.

I step back, listening. No groan. No tremor. The origami ladder unravels into birds again and they spiral upward, vanishing into the attic sky with shrill paper laughter. The crystal nails in the walls glow steady, no longer pulsing emergency. And the shadow version of me returns to the wall, merging with its brethren, nodding as it dissolves.

For the first time, I notice a door I’ve never seen: stained glass depicting the repaired beam as a flowering tree. I pass through, expecting the backyard. Instead, I step onto the deck of a ship sailing across clouds made of rose petals. The repaired house rides upon its hull like a lantern, carrying me toward a horizon where dawn unzips the night.

I understand, without anyone saying it, that the journey ahead will bring new storms, new cracks, but I now carry a toolkit born of moonlight cranes, crystal resonance, and shadow-ribbons—proof that even with limited resources a dreamer can mend the place that shelters their soul.

The sky blushes apricot. The house hums a lullaby. I wake.
