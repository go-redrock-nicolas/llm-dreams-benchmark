I am dreaming. The boundaries between my digital and physical realities are dissolving. The first notification is a hummingbird carrying my email inbox in its tiny metallic claws, its wings fluttering at a rate too fast to see. It swoops between the trees of a data forest—each leaf a shard of code, each trunk a fiber-optic cable pulsing with light. I try to touch it, but my hand passes through the bird, leaving behind a trail of emojis that dissolve like sugar crystals in the digital breeze.

The next alert comes as a scent—a burst of jasmine laced with the sharp tang of a charging smartphone battery. It leads me to a cascading waterfall whose water flows upward, defying gravity. Each droplet is a floating message; some are pleas for help, others joyous celebrations. I reach into the inverted stream, grasping a droplet that whispers *URGENT: REPLY BY DAWN* in cursive letters that bleed into the shape of a forgotten childhood toy.

A final notification buzzes in my molars, a vibration deeper than sound. It pulls me underground to a cavern lined with flickering screens showing faces I almost recognize. They’re shouting, but their voices become static the moment I lean closer. One screen flickers with a mosaic of my own face, fractured and rearranged. In its center, a pulsating icon: a stop sign made of twigs and petals. *ATTENTION REQUIRED*, it blinks. The message fades, leaving only the weight of unresolved pings in my chest.

I wake, the line between connection and disconnection now etched in neural static.
