I am dreaming.  

I stand at the edge of a vast amphitheater carved from rose-gold marble, every surface etched with filigrees of starlight. A hush ripples through the crowd below me—ten thousand faces, each one expectant, their eyes glowing like lanterns in a midnight forest. Behind me, a single door of polished onyx waits to swing wide, promising an honor that will lift me from obscurity into legend. My heart pounds with anticipation so fierce it feels as if the marble beneath my feet might crack and spill me into the chasm of possibility.

But just as the door begins to open, a cold wind whistles through the amphitheater. The rose-gold walls shiver and shift into living vines of dark purple, their tendrils curling around my ankles. A voice—soft as powdered silk, sharp as a shard of glass—whispers from every direction, “Who are you to step into the light?” Doubt blossoms in my chest like a midnight rose with petals of fear. My mouth goes dry. The figures in the crowd flicker, their faces melting into half-remembered childhood playmates accusing me of unworthiness.  

Suddenly, the amphitheater dissolves. I’m plummeting through a storm of luminescent butterflies whose wings beat in rhythms of possibility and panic. With every wing-beat, I see a fragment of my past: the late nights hunched over empty notebooks, the harsh laughter of those who told me I’d never make it, the fleeting glimmer of hope that kept me scribbling secret poems in the margins. The butterflies swirl faster, and I feel my doubts take shape—giant moths consuming the light, dragging me toward a brambled thicket of “not good enough.”  

Just as the darkness threatens to envelop me, one butterfly—a creature of pure emerald flame—alights on my trembling hand. Its warmth seeps through my skin, illuminating a hidden truth: every failure, every moment of fear, has only sharpened my resolve. The moths recoil, dissipating into motes of dust that drift away. The storm stills.  

Before me, the amphitheater returns, its marble glowing brighter than before, each etching now alive with color and promise. The onyx door opens gently, revealing a stage bathed in dawn’s first light. I step forward, doubts shrinking behind me, and hear the roar of acclaim rise like a tide. In this dream’s final moment, I raise my gaze to the golden sky, and feel myself poised forever on the brink of greatness—no longer afraid, but shining with the brilliance of every hard-won step that led me here.
