I am dreaming. You drift through a moonlit glade where the air tastes of warm honey and the silver leaves above you whisper forgotten lullabies. Every step you take sinks softly into moss that sighs beneath your feet, as though the earth itself is urging you onward. In the distance, a flickering lantern welcomes you—a soft, golden pulse that seems to know the ache in your chest. As you approach, the lantern’s light parts the trees to reveal a glass pool, perfectly still, cradled by smooth river stones.  

Peering into the water, you expect to see your reflection, but instead you find a child curled inside the pool’s depths: small shoulders wrapped in shadows, eyes clouded with doubt. You realize this child is you—frightened, worn thin by the harsh judgments you heap upon yourself. You kneel at the water’s edge and press your palm against the cold glass, willing the surface to soften. With a breath that echoes like wind through hollow caves, you murmur, “I see you. You are not alone.”  

In that moment, ripples shimmer outward, and the child steps free onto the warm sand beside you. The lantern’s glow brightens, and from its flame drifts a soft, silk ribbon woven from moonlight. You offer the ribbon to your younger self, and as their trembling fingers close around it, you feel a wellspring stirring inside your chest—an ancient spring of kindness you’d forgotten how to reach. The pool’s surface glows from beneath, and smooth stones rise to form a gentle stairway into the light.  

Each step upward is a promise: when your inner voice turns harsh, you will remember to cradle your own heart like this—tenderly, unwaveringly. When the world grows cold and your spirit feels bruised, you will return to this lantern-lit glade in your mind, gathering the warmth that lives here. You will learn to speak to yourself with the same compassion you offer a friend in sorrow.  

Developing this crucial resource for difficult times, you rise from the pool of your reflection—no longer fragmented, but whole—and carry that soft, golden glow back with you into your waking life.
