I am dreaming. I find myself in a marblewalled courtyard filled with gently glowing lanterns the color of moonlight and rose petals. All around me, robed figures move in silent choreography—each hand gesture, each footstep precise and laden with meaning. When I arrive, the air vibrates with low, humming music, and the scent of jasmine lingers on every breeze. In this world, greeting a stranger isn’t spoken in words but woven with ribbons of light that pass between your heart and theirs, a dance you must learn by watching the elders’ graceful arcs.

Unsure of the steps, I offer what I think is a respectful bow—head to ground, arms outstretched. For a heartbeat, the courtyard holds its breath. Then a soft chime shatters the hush. Ripples of pale blue energy spiral up from beneath my fingertips, tracing patterns of offense across the gathering. I’ve unknowingly touched the “Dancing Bones” glyph inset in the polished marble—an act so taboo it summons instant judgment. The elders freeze mid-gesture; their glowing eyes narrow. A hush deeper than absence falls.

Suddenly, the marble floor splits open in a swirl of starlight, and tendrils of opal mist coil around my ankles. The high priestess drifts forward, her voice a whisper that echoes like thunder: “You have broken the covenant of unspoken vows. You owe your sincerity to the Flame of Clarity.” Around me, the lanterns bow, the light fading to embers. I realize now that to atone, I must step into the crevice of starlit smoke, hands open, ready to offer the one true thing I carry—my genuine apology. As I lean toward the glowing fissure, every breath shimmers with the promise of redemption… or descent into something far stranger than banishment.
