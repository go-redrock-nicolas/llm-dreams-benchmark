I am dreaming. **Dream: The Symphony of Fractured Horizons**  

You awaken not in a bed, but in a *suspended moment*—a pocket of stillness stitched between the seams of time. The air hums with the resonance of a thousand untuned violins, each string vibrating at the frequency of a forgotten memory. Above, the sky is a rotating cube, its faces flickering between epochs: a primordial swamp, a neon bazaar on a planet that doesn’t exist, a library where books are bound in human skin and whisper their plots aloud. You realize the ground beneath you isn’t earth, but a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting not your face, but your *soul*—a creature of smoke and antlers, half-shadow, half-song.  

A figure approaches, but it’s not a being so much as a *phenomenon*. They are draped in robes woven from static, their face a kaleidoscope of every person you’ve ever loved and forgotten. When they speak, their voice is a flock of starlings rearranging itself into sentences: *“You’ve crossed the border where metaphors become geography. Step carefully—the laws here are poems, not physics.”* They hand you a key made of frozen silence, and you understand without understanding: this key unlocks doors that *don’t want to be found*.  

You wander into a forest where trees grow in spirals, their bark etched with equations that bleed when solved. The leaves are translucent membranes, each holding a tiny, screaming sun. Birds made of cursive script nest in their branches, pecking at constellations torn from the night sky and stuffed into their beaks. You pluck a leaf; it transforms into a moth with stained-glass wings, which immediately sets itself on fire to write a haiku in ash: *“Ash becomes wings; wings become hunger; hunger becomes hymn.”*  

The ground shifts, liquefying into a soup of primordial color—neither liquid nor solid, but a *negotiation*. You sink, not downward, but *sideways*, into a city built inside a gargantuan skull. The buildings are vertebrae carved into cathedrals, their spires piercing clouds of sentient fog that hum Gregorian chants. Elevators ascend via gravitational heresy, defying not just physics but *intent*; they rise only when passengers forget what they seek. You enter one, and it plunges into the marrow of the earth, where rivers of liquid mercury carry the memories of extinct species.  

There, you meet a lover who is not a person but a *season*—Autumn incarnate, clad in burning leaves and the scent of decay. They kiss you, and you taste the end of things: wilted roses, abandoned houses, the last note of a dying symphony. Their touch unravels your bones into vines, your blood into wine. “*To be whole,*” they murmur, “*is to be broken into a million hungers. Embrace the fracture.*”  

You flee, or perhaps you’re chased—by what, you don’t know, for the pursuer exists only in peripheral glances: a silhouette that flickers between a wolf, a war, and a black hole gnawing on its own event horizon. You sprint into a desert where dunes are made of hourglasses, each grain a tiny scream escaping a trapped soul. The horizon is a rotating door, and when you grasp its handle, it becomes a serpent devouring its own tail, which becomes a ring, which becomes a wound, which becomes a window.  

Outside the window: a child on a beach, building a sandcastle that grows and mutates into a fractal labyrinth. The waves are made of hands, clapping in arrhythmic applause, and the moon is a cyclops eye, blinking in slow motion. The child turns, and their face is yours, but older, sadder, *unspooled*. “*You’re still here?*” they laugh, their voice the sound of tectonic plates colliding. “*This isn’t a dream. It’s a rebellion. Against linearity. Against sense. Against the tyranny of endings.*”  

You wake with a gasp, clutching your chest—only to find your heart is now a hummingbird, trapped in a cage of ribs that sing in Fibonacci sequences. The room around you is subtly wrong: shadows lean left when they should lean right, and the clock on the wall has no hands, only a single eye that winks at you, mouthing the word *“again.”*  

And you know—this is no mere dream. It’s a virus in reality’s code, a glitch in the cathedral of the ordinary. You will never again see the world as you did before. The boundaries are torn. The poems have escaped their pages. The key is still in your hand, burning cold.  

You smile. You scream. You begin to write.
