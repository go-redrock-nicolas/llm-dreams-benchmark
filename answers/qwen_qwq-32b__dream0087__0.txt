I am dreaming. I'm in a large room that feels ancient and yet futuristic, with walls that shimmer like liquid metal. There's a round table in the center with seven chairs, each glowing with a different color. The room has no windows but is brightly lit, as if illuminated by the air itself.

The family members are seated around the table. Each of them radiates an aura matching the color of their chair: crimson, sapphire, emerald, gold, violet, indigo, and amber. Their faces are both familiar and strange, like looking at reflections in rippling water. I can sense the weight of centuries-old grievances. Voices are raised now, words sharp and jagged as broken glass. The air crackles with tension.

Then—something shifts. The floor beneath us begins to dissolve into a swirling vortex, but instead of falling, we all rise gently into the air. The vortex is not dark and terrifying but alive with bioluminescent plants and floating islands adorned with crystalline trees. The family members are still arguing, but their voices now carry the melodic tones of a distant choir, blending hostility with harmony.

Suddenly, a creature appears. It has the body of a stag but antlers like intertwined rivers, sparkling with miniature galaxies. Its eyes hold the depth of ancient ponds. The creature speaks in the voice of a thousand whispers, each a different language yet all understood. "You are rooted in the same soil but have forgotten the ground that binds your roots," it says.

The family members float still, suspended between fury and wonder. I notice that our reflection in the air above shows not the angry faces, but the original unity—a single face with seven expressions, each glowing like a constellation. The creature bows, and offers a sapling from its antlers. The tree’s leaves shimmer with all seven colors. As it places it into the center of the floating vortex, the ground beneath reforms into a new island. The roots spread like veins, binding each floating island together. The family’s auras begin to intertwine, colors blending gently, like dawn mixing with dusk.

The dream ends as softly as it began, the words of the creature echoing. When I wake, there’s a faint tingling in my fingertips, as if I’d been holding something alive.
