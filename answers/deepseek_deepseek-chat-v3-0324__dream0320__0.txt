I am dreaming. **Dreamscape: The Labyrinth of Whispering Mirrors**  

I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and broken promises, a metallic tang lingering like the ghost of old regrets. Above me, the sky is not sky at all—but a writhing expanse of translucent veils, shimmering between indigo and the faded gold of a forgotten hour. Stars pulse within them like slow, blinking eyes.  

Before me stretches a corridor of mirrors, twisting at impossible angles, their surfaces neither glass nor silver but something alive—shifting, breathing. Each reflection is mine, and yet not mine: versions of myself I recognize, some half-formed, some fractured, some radiant with a knowledge I do not yet possess. One wears a crown of thorned lilies; another stares back with hollow sockets, whispering words I can almost—*almost*—grasp.  

The path forks endlessly, but no choice feels like my own. The ground trembles with each step, as though the labyrinth itself resists decision. To the left, a door of blackened oak groans open, revealing a room where time moves backward—raindrops ascending, laughter unraveling into silence. To the right, a spiral staircase leads upward into a storm of feathers, each one etched with a name I've never spoken aloud.  

And then there is the third path—one that wasn't there a moment ago. A narrow archway woven from shadows and spider silk. It hums. A soundless invitation.  

*Choose*, the mirrors murmur—but their voices slip through me like smoke. There is no right answer. No map. Only the prickling certainty that every step will rewrite me.  

I reach out, fingers brushing the edge of the archway—  

—and the dream shudders.
