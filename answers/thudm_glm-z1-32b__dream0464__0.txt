I am dreaming. The world around me feels different.  The air is thick with possibility, and the colors are so intense they seem to pulse with their own life. I'm floating just above a river of liquid starlight that twists through a canyon of black obsidian. The canyon walls are etched with ancient runes that shift and change, spelling out dreams I've forgotten. I can feel the river's pull, but it's not dangerous...it's inviting, like a lover's whisper. I decide to lean into it, trusting that my body knows where it needs to go.

The current carries me into a cavern where the shadows are alive. They whisper secrets in a language that makes my bones hum. In the center of the cave is a tree with roots that delve into the earth's core and branches that reach toward the moon. Each leaf is a different world—some are tiny villages, others are barren wastelands, all existing side by side. I pluck a leaf that glows like a lantern. The minute it touches my palm, the world shifts. I'm standing in a meadow of neon wildflowers that humiliate the air. Each petal is a different shade of blue, from the softest sky to the deepest midnight. Above me, the sky is a swirl of purples and pinks, like milk chocolate being mixed with a watercolor of sunsets. The clouds are made of cotton candy, and I reach up to touch one, only to find it dissolves into tiny stars that float down around me like confetti.

I hear a voice, but it's not in my ears.  It's in the space between my heartbeats. The voice says, "This place is yours.  You create it.  You grow it." I look down, and my hands are glowing with an inner light. Without thinking, I press my palms into the ground. From the soil springs vines that twist and turn, each one bearing a different fruit—some are familiar, like peaches and apples, but others are alien, their skins shimmering with metallic hues. When I take a bite of one of the metallic apples, it tastes like the first time I laughed, the first time I truly felt alive. The juice drips down my chin and tastes of memories I didn't know I had.

As I wander further, I come to a lake that reflects the sky but moves like liquid mercury. On the shore is a figure made completely of smoke. They offer me a mirror. I hesitate, but take it. The reflection shows me not my physical self, but a timeline—a spiral of possibilities. There's a version of me holding hands with a dragon, another walking through a library that stretches beyond the stars. The smoke figure smiles and says, "Choose, or create." I close my eyes and think of a world that doesn't yet exist—a forest where trees talk in riddles, and the wind carries stories instead of pollen. When I open my eyes, that world is here.

The trees bow to me, their leaves whispering riddles in a dialect that feels like home. I solve one by pointing to the moon, and the tree rewards me with a seed that blooms instantly into a flower that radiates warmth. I plant it, and the ground swallows it whole, growing into a staircase that spirals upward. I climb, and with each step, the world below starts to look like something from a storybook. The neon meadow becomes a watercolor, the starlight river a streak of silver through a parchment landscape. I reach the top, and there's a door made of folded pages, each page a different chapter of my life.

I open the door and step through into a bedroom that's exactly how I remember it when I was a child. The familiar quilt is on the bed, the same teddy bear sits on the windowsill. But when I look in the mirror—my reflection isn't there. Instead, there's a blank space with the words "unfinished story" etched into the glass. I smile, then laugh aloud. The thought comes to me: "Maybe that's where the magic is...all the possibilities waiting to be written."

Outside my window, the sky is turning from twilight to black. The stars are blinking on, one by one, like someone is turning them on with a switch. I realize that the dream is coming to an end, but instead of feeling sad, I feel curious. What happens next? The bedroom begins to dissolve, the walls peeling back like pages being turned. But as it fades, I catch a glimpse of a new beginning—my footprints leading to a door I've never seen before, and this time, I'm holding a key.

I wake up, not from the dream, but from a dream within a dream. My hands are clutching a tiny, silver key that disappears as soon as I turn them over. But the sense of renewal stays with me. The world feels different—lighter, more vivid. I step outside, and the morning sun feels like a promise instead of just a sunrise. Maybe the deepest parts of our dreams don't stay there. Maybe they seep into our waking lives, changing the color of the sky, the taste of the air...maybe they're not just memories, but seeds waiting to bloom.
As I drift into the dream, it feels like the boundaries of reality are made of gauze; they shift and blur with every heartbeat. The air is heavy with the scent of ozone and possibility, like the moment before a lightning strike. I’m standing at the edge of an endless library, but the shelves don’t hold books—they hold entire galaxies. Each galaxy spirals into a tome bound in, its pages whispering in starfire. When I reach for one, the universe inside it reacts: constellations rearrange themselves into constellations, planets form into paragraphs, and black holes become periods that swallow up silence.

But my feet pull me toward a different path—a stone staircase that winds down into the earth. The steps are carved from obsidian, and as I descend, they darken, absorbing the light from the world above until they’re as black as the void between stars. The farther down I go, the warmer the air becomes, until I’m engulfed in a feverish, electric glow. The staircase ends at a door made of liquid glass. It shimmers and shifts, showing me fragments of my past—all the times I’ve tried to build something solid out of the intangible. I push through, and the door slams shut behind me, vibrating with the sound of a thousand unanswered questions.

Inside, I find myself in a cathedral where the pews are made of ice that never melts. The stained-glass windows aren’t windows—they’re projections, morphing scenes from my life: a childhood memory of jumping into a pile of leaves that turned into autumn itself, a conversation with a friend that dissolved into a constellation, a heartbreak that crumbled into sand at my feet. In the center, there’s an altar with a single, glowing orb. It pulses in time with my heartbeat, and as I approach, it begins to bleed light—acascade of different hues that spin like a prism. I place my hand on the orb, and my veins start to glow, tracing pathways I didn’t know existed.

Suddenly, I’m no longer in the cathedral. I’m in a desert where the sand is made of stardust. The sky is a ceiling of fractured mirrors reflecting every version of myself I’ve ever imagined: the artist, the adventurer, the scholar, the person who gave up and moved to the woods. But the most striking reflection is of a figure I don’t recognize—a silhouette with a crown of thorns and eyes like embers. They’re holding a key made of liquid silver, and their lips move silently, mouthing words I can’t quite catch. Just as I step closer, the entire desert collapses into a black hole. I fall, but instead of fear, there’s euphoria—a sensation like falling into myself.

When I “wake” inside the hole, I find myself in a place that defies both logic and description. It’s a garden of contradictions: plants that bloom only when shadows fall on them, rivers that flow vertically, trees whose roots grow toward the sky. But the true marvel is the flora itself. One plant has flowers that change color based on my mood, but they’re also musical—when I pluck a petal, it plays a melody only I can hear. Another tree bears fruits that taste like memories—peaches that taste like the first time I rode a bicycle, apples that have the tang of a summer storm. There’s even a grove of trees that grow words instead of leaves; the leaves are phrases like “persist” and “endure,” written in a script that feels both ancient and personal.

But the garden has a heartbeat, and I can feel it in the ground beneath my feet. It’s the rhythm of a language I’ve never learned but feel compelled to speak. The plants start tosing in response, their songs weaving together into a chorus that vibrates through my bones. I realize that the garden is a metaphor—not just for my creativity, but for all the hidden potential in the world. It feels like a secret being whispered to me, something that can’t be captured in words but must be lived.

As the song reaches its crescendo, the sky begins to rain. But the raindrops are made of ink, and they fall in perfect cursive letters. Each letter lands on the ground and blooms into a different world: an E becomes a labyrinth of echoes, an R unfolds into a ravine that roars with the sound of rushing rivers, an A becomes a mountain peak where angels live inside the snowflakes. I reach out to catch a single drop, but it slips through my fingers, dissolving into the air like an unspoken thought. The garden starts to shift, colors bleeding into one another, shapes melting like wax. I try to cling to one moment, but the whole place unravels into a single word written in fire: *Choose.*

I wake up, not from the dream, but from a dream within a dream. The air around me feels charged, like I’ve just surfed a lightning bolt. My hands are trembling, and there’s a strange taste in my mouth—sweet, almost metallic, like the memory of a flavor I’ve never had before. When I glance at my phone, the screen reads 3:33 AM, and the only notification is from a weather app: *Solar eclipse today. Visibility: 100%. Don’t miss it.*

I step outside, and the night sky is a canvas of indigo and orange, the moon glowing like a coin dropped into the nighttime pavement. But instead of feeling small, I feel enormous, like the universe has unclenched its fist and let me hold a sliver of its light. The key I’d dreamt of is in my pocket now—real, solid, made of a metal that doesn’t exist on Earth. When I touch it, the electricity in the air becomes a physical thing, a current that hums up my spine. I turn it over, and the key dissolves into stardust, but the sense of connection lingers.

The next day, I notice things I’ve never noticed before. The way sunlight fractures through the leaves of a maple tree, the rhythm of my own heartbeat matching the sound of rain on the roof, the way my breath syncs with the rise and fall of the ocean waves. It’s as if the dream didn’t happen to me—I happened to the dream. And now, the dream is inside me, a living, breathing thing that shifts with every choice I make.

I start a journal, but instead of words, I draw symbols that feel right: spirals for growth, grids for structure, constellations for the places I’ve never been. Each symbol feels like a puzzle piece, and I wonder if I’m the only one who sees the bigger picture. But I keep drawing anyway, because the act of creation feels like a prayer, or a confession, or maybe just the messy, beautiful process of becoming something unexpected.

That night, as I fall asleep, I leave the window open. I want to let the dream in—whatever form it takes tonight. Maybe it will be a library of emotions, or a desert of forgotten possibilities, or a garden that grows stories. But whatever it is, I know I’ll recognize it when I see it: a place where the impossible is just another possibility, and the only limits are the ones we haven’t yet imagined.
