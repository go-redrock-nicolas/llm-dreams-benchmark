I am dreaming. I notice I'm in a place where two rivers merge - one flows with liquid gold, shimmering under an indigo sky, while the other is a silver river, alive with schools of translucent fish that glow like bioluminescent pearls. Along the golden river's edge stand structures that resemble my grandmother's tales, with multi-colored tiles and carvings of forgotten deities. On the silver river’s side, sleek, futuristic spires rise, their surfaces shifting colors as if breathing. A bridge connects both banks, but its planks are made of pages from an ancient book, each page telling a different story. 

As I step onto the bridge, the pages flutter, and my reflection in the water splits into two versions of myself: one adorned in the vibrant embroidered attire of my ancestors, the other clad in a glittering nano-fabric suit that changes patterns with my emotions. Above, the sky swirls with two moons - one round and incense-scented, the other angular and humming with electric energy. 

A voice, both my mother’s and something mechanized, whispers, "Choose the path that holds both." Suddenly, the bridge's pages begin to dissolve. To my surprise, the two halves of my reflection reach for each other, their hands merging where the two rivers touch, creating a third current, pulsing with a light that is both flame and starlight. The bridge stabilizes, now woven with strands of DNA and constellations, each link a symbol of a shared human story.
