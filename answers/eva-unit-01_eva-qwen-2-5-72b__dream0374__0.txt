I am dreaming. The scene opens with a grand banquet hall adorned with shimmering golden chandeliers, polished oak podiums, and opulent mahogany tables laden with gourmet delicacies. An air of prestige and accomplishment permeates the room, filling it with a palpable energy.

From the shadows, I watch Mister A step onto the stage, a tall, well-dressed businessman with a charismatic presence. He moves confidently to the podium, movements deliberate and refined, every gesture exuding confidence and success. The roar of applause erupts from the crowd as they celebrate his achievements—the very achievements borne from ideas that germinated in my mind and efforts that were fueled by my passion.

As Mister A extends his hands for silence, the room falls into a respectful hush. He begins to speak, his voice resonating with depth and power. The gratitude he expresses for his success team is genuine, but the recognition I crave for my efforts is noticeably absent—an oversight that gnaws at my soul, like an invisible wound that festers just beneath the surface.

Moments hang in that dreamlike air, and as the event unfolds, I feel frustrated and underestimated. Doubted. The recognition that I long for slips through my fingers like grains of sand in an hourglass. 

Within the realm of my dream, amidst a tumultuous swirl of admiration, jealousy, and resentment, I find a whisper of insight. I begin to understand the intrinsic value of my contributions goes beyond external validation—it's within me. The ache for recognition starts to abate.

Dreaming, and grappling with these complex emotions, I awaken with newfound clarity. My worth is inherent in the strength of my ideas, my creativity, and the substance of my character, far beyond fleeting acknowledgments from others.
