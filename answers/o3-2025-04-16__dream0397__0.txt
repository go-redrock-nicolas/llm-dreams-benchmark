I am dreaming. …let the current pull me along, and it deposits me in the hushed nave of an impossibly tall, candle-lit cathedral built entirely of paper. The pillars are stacked folios, the vault a patchwork of manuscripts stitched together by moonlight, and every slightest breath makes the whole place rustle like a gigantic rainstick. My footfalls send ripples of ink skittering across the parquet of parchment beneath me.

High above, suspended from invisible threads, hang a thousand blank masks—porcelain faces waiting for expression. Each time I glance up, one of them drifts lower, as if curious. Their hollow eyes feel neither threatening nor kind, only expectant, as though they know something I do not.

A tremor of recognition: I am meant to sing.

The absurdity hits me first. I can’t sing. My childhood report cards all carried that tactful note—“enthusiastic, but off-key.” And yet, somewhere in the sawdust of dream logic, the cathedral itself seems to inhale on my behalf. The air thickens with unsung lullabies and half-imagined hymns, pressing gently against my chest like a pleading instrument. I open my mouth.

At first, only a dry, single syllable escapes, trembling like a moth in a storm. The paper walls absorb it, crinkle, and then echo it back—larger, rounder, polished. That echo pours through me, and suddenly the note fragments into entire chords that have never existed in the waking world: aquamarine harmonies tinged with the scent of sea salt, burgundy minor thirds that taste faintly of warm raspberries, a golden major seventh fizzing like distant fireworks behind my ribs.

Color sluices down the pillars, draining the black ink from the pages and repainting them in living watercolors that travel outward in arpeggios. Every sheet of paper grows translucent, revealing silhouettes of untold stories fluttering in its fiber. The blank masks glow from within, and one by one they bloom—smiles, tears, wrinkles, freckles—each visage sculpted by the precise tone currently spiraling from my throat.

I think, “This is impossible,” yet the thought itself becomes a glittering countermelody, a ribboning clarinet trill that curls around the vault and outlines new constellations on the ceiling. The cathedral shifts shape: pews dissolve into lily pads floating on a placid ink-blue pond, and the pillars tilt, turning into cypress trees whose leaves are staves of silent sheet music fluttering in the wind.

That’s when I notice an audience gathering—creatures of sheer abstraction. A seated trio of triangles, a flock of punctuation marks wearing tiny monocles, a grandmother clock knitting seconds together with celestial yarn. They applaud not with hands but with little bursts of luminescence, as though the very idea of clapping has taken physical form.

Still singing, I step onto the pond. Instead of sinking, I glide forward, skimming across the surface in effortless crescendos. Each note I release spawns crystalline water lilies that open, reveal calligraphed petals, and swivel their anthers like tuning forks. My voice, once an uncertain hush in a paper cathedral, now blankets the sky in symphonic auroras.

But the melody needs a culmination. Instinct tells me the final chord is hiding somewhere deeper. I look down through the ink-water and glimpse a submerged staircase spiraling into darkness. Without breaking the song, I kneel, press my hand to the surface, and the pond parts as though turning a page. Down I descend—spiral after spiral, each step a different timbre, from velvety violas to bright glass bells.

At the bottom waits a single seed made of silence—a black pearl of absolute hush, the negative of sound. I understand: to complete the piece, I must cradle that silence in the heart of the music. I lift the seed; it’s weightless, colder than night. The note sustaining in my lungs wavers, ready to falter. Fear flickers—what if everything collapses into muteness?

Instead, I stitch the silence right into the tail of the next phrase, a beat of pure, immaculate nothing. In that moment, every paper wall, every cypress staff, every mask and creature, shivers and falls into perfect alignment. The cathedral, the pond, the staircase—they revolve around me like the facets of a kaleidoscope, and then snap closed into a single luminous point, softer than candlelight, yet vast enough to hold galaxies.

I wake—breathless, voice still humming some half-remembered interval—and taste ink and raspberries in the back of my throat. My room is dim, ordinary, but my chest resonates with a phantom timpanist’s roll. Fingers itch for sheet music though I still can’t read a note. Somewhere outside, a real bird tests the first syllable of dawn.

And I realize: talent or no, training or none, the dream has carved a resonant chamber inside me. The song may be fragile in the waking air, but its echo is permanent. I sit up, whisper the opening note, and even in the mundane hush of morning, the walls rustle—just faintly—as if a paper cathedral remembers me.
