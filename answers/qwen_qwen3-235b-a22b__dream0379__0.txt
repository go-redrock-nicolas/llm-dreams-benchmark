I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a labyrinth of liquid glass, reflecting a sky stitched with constellations that pulse like living veins. You walk barefoot across a bridge made of suspended piano keys, each step echoing a note that ripples through the air and distorts the horizon. Below, a river of ink swirls with faces—strangers and familiar ghosts—calling your name in harmonies that fray at the edges. You pause, gripping the railing, which shifts beneath your hands into something warm and breathing: a serpent coiled in a question mark.  

You realize you’ve been here before. Not in this exact shape, but in echoes—a memory of a dream nested inside another. The serpent hisses, *“Why do you ask them now? You used to know.”* Its voice is your own, fractured and ancient. You don’t answer. Instead, you look down and see your shadow has unraveled, trailing behind you like a thread caught in a storm. It no longer mirrors your movements.  

Ahead, a city rises from the clouds, its towers built of teeth and hourglasses. You approach a gate guarded by faceless figures draped in velvet robes. They hold scales made of moth wings and ask, *“What have you brought to prove you are real?”* You fumble for your pockets, but they’re filled with ash and the brittle husks of forgotten choices. You think of the decisions you once made without hesitation—the way you left a lover’s bed at dawn, the way you carved your name into the bark of a dying tree, the way you trusted the compass of your own pulse. Now, you hesitate. You want to ask the guards if they’ve seen your shadow, if they know why it’s fraying, if they can tell you why you suddenly crave their nod, their stamp, their *yes*.  

But the gates creak open anyway, and you step inside.  

The city is a cacophony of mirrors. Every surface reflects not your face, but versions of yourself you never met: a warrior with your eyes but a stranger’s scars, a beggar humming a lullaby you once sang, a child scribbling constellations on the pavement. You reach out to touch one mirror, and the glass bleeds, whispering, *“You used to be enough. Why aren’t you now?”*  

A figure emerges from the crowd—a woman with your hair but no mouth, holding a lantern filled with trapped fireflies. She points to a door at the city’s heart, its wood gnarled and veined like skin. You push it open, and inside is a room with no walls, only a single chair and a mirror that does not reflect.  

The voice of the serpent returns, softer now: *“You asked them because you forgot the sound of your own ‘yes.’ But it’s still here, in the marrow.”*  

The mirror shatters.  

You wake tangled in sheets, the taste of stardust on your tongue. For a moment, the dream clings—its questions, its hunger—but then it slips away like water off a stone. Yet in the quiet aftermath, you feel it: a flicker in your chest, small but steady, like a flame rediscovered.
