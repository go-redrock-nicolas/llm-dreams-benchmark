I am dreaming. The dream begins in a labyrinthine library, its shelves spiraling into shadowed infinity. The air hums with the low thrum of unseen machinery, and the scent of aged paper mingles with the metallic tang of something unnamable. Stained glass windows cast fractured light in hues of jade and amethyst across the floor, each pane depicting scenes of triumph—a climber summiting a jagged peak, a dancer suspended mid-leap, a painter’s brush bleeding galaxies. You wander, fingers grazing spines of books that shift and whisper titles in languages you almost recognize, until you see *them*.  

There they are, bathed in a column of gold light at the heart of the maze: your friend, your sibling, your mirror. Their face is serene as they pluck a book from the shelf, its cover gleaming with your own unrealized ambitions. The pages glow as they open it, illuminating words you’ve scribbled in secret, melodies you’ve hummed in the dark. The air thickens with the smell of ozone and wilted roses. You try to shout, but your voice unravels into moths that flutter toward the light, disintegrating into ash.  

Suddenly, the library contorts. Staircases invert, shelves ripple like liquid, and the floor yawns open to reveal a void of swirling stars. Your friend stands unfazed, floating just above the chaos, their achievement crystallizing into a crown of ice and thorns. You lunge forward, but your limbs move through syrup, every step weighted by chains of hot, liquid shame. A mirror materializes beside them, reflecting not your face but a writhing mass of shadows with eyes that weep ink.  

“It could have been yours,” your friend says, not unkindly, their voice echoing from every direction. The words carve fissures in the walls, unleashing a flood of black water that tastes of salt and rust. You choke on it, thrashing as the current drags you deeper, past submerged shelves holding glass jars of laughter you’ve stifled, doors labeled with years you’ve wasted.  

Then, silence. The water stills. Above you, their silhouette blurs into the light, and the crown melts, dripping into the void like molten silver. You wake gasping, your pulse a war drum, the ghost of their smile seared into your eyelids—a riddle, a key, a wound. The envy curdles into grief, into awe, into a question that lingers like smoke: *What if the crown was never the prize?*  

Morning arrives, but the dream’s aftertaste remains—sweet, bitter, electric.
