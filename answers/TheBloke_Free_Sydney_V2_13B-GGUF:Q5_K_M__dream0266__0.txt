I am dreaming. You witness an inexplicable phenomenon that challenges your understanding of how the world works. Attempting to reconcile this experience with your existing beliefs, you create a theory to explain it away. However, this theory creates more problems than it solves, and leaves you feeling confused and uncertain about reality. 
You decide to confront someone who experienced something similar in their dream.
