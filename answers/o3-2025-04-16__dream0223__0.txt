I am dreaming. The dream pours in like flood-water through a broken levee—sudden, unstoppable, shimmering with odd reflections.

I blink awake inside a field hospital that seems stitched together from two incompatible worlds: half Victorian infirmary with brass lamps and lace curtains, half humming space-station corridor with holographic status boards that flicker between languages I’ve never seen. The walls breathe in and out like lungs; the floor pulses beneath my shoes with a faint bioluminescent glow, as if the whole structure is alive and worried.

Outside, a sky the color of bruised apricots roils with silent lightning. People stream through a canvas flap, a line that feels infinite: parents carrying children wrapped in blankets made of static, firefighters coated in crystalline ash, a woman in a wedding dress trailing sparks instead of lace. Their injuries change as they cross the threshold—cuts braid themselves into strange geometric shapes, burns bloom into phosphorescent flowers that emit a low chime, bones glow through skin like x-ray lanterns. It is beautiful and terrible, a symphony of unraveling physics.

Around me, the staff are an impossible ensemble: a robotic surgeon whose stainless-steel arms are rusting in real time, a stoic nurse with a stethoscope made of origami cranes, a frantic pharmacist consulting an encyclopedia that re-writes itself every time she turns the page. And then there is the binder in my hand: Protocols, Triage Priority, Resource Allocation. Every page contradicts the one before it—one moment the book proclaims, “Treat the youngest first,” then the words rearrange into, “Treat those likeliest to lead,” and finally, in red ink that drips and pools like fresh paint, “Treat the dreamer who decides.”

Someone hands me a clipboard made of mirrored glass. My own reflection stares back: eyes wide, coat too large, badge labelled “First Responder / Last Line.” My heart hammers out a drumbeat that syncs with the building’s breathing walls.

“Room Five,” the origami-stethoscope nurse tells me, voice fluttering like soaked paper. “They need you now. Or maybe Room Seven. The numbers won’t stay put.”

I step through a doorway that unravels into a stairwell spiraling both upward and downward at once. With each step, the fluorescent bulbs overhead burst into constellations, tossing stardust onto gurneys lined along the rails. Patients watch me with eyes that hold tidal pools and city skylines, wordless pleas lodged in their throats like broken arrows.

A siren—low, mournful—ripples through the corridors: our already-dwindling supplies have apparently vanished altogether. IV bags shrivel into wilted flowers, oxygen tanks exhale and float away like silver balloons. Even hope feels rationed.

On a landing I meet a child whose skin flickers between ages—five, fifteen, forty-two—like a skipping film reel. He clutches a chess piece, a white queen cracked in half. He says nothing, just holds it out as though it’s a question I’ll know how to answer. I have no answers, only the weight of choices nobody should make.

The stairwell splits in two, and suddenly I’m forced to decide: to the left, a ward where those with visible wounds cry out for immediate help; to the right, a dim hall lined with silent figures whose injuries are invisible but deadly. The binder in my hand flips open of its own accord, pages fluttering wildly until it lands on a single line glowing like neon:

“Follow the pulse of the living story.”

I press two fingers to my wrist and feel my pulse, then press a hand to the wall—its heartbeat is slower, steadier. I choose the right-hand passage, guided by intuition masquerading as fate. As I move, doors whisper open, revealing rooms where reality is negotiable: an MRI machine made of spiderweb and moonlight scans a man made entirely of musical notes; an antiseptic sink fills with color instead of water; overhead speakers broadcast lullabies in whale song.

In the last room, I find an old woman lying beneath a quilt stitched from newspaper headlines that fade as she exhales. Her eyes glitter like evening stars, calm despite the chaos. “I’ve been waiting for you,” she says, voice thin but sure. “Not to save me—no, the dream never lets us keep what we want—but to remember.”

She presses something into my palm: a compass with no needle, only swirling ink that forms words I somehow understand: The way out is through the telling.

I look back toward the hall. The disaster, the need, the contradictions—they’re still there, but suddenly they feel like unwritten pages instead of immutable fate. I realize that in this dream, I am not just triaging bodies; I am triaging narratives, deciding what stories must continue, which ones must rest, how to ferry memory across a collapsing bridge of time.

The sirens fall silent. The building exhales one final gust, and the walls dissolve into dawn-colored mist. Patients rise, their wounds peeling away like shed skins, drifting upward into the sky that’s turning the pale pink of new beginnings. The binder in my hand becomes a feather. The compass transforms into a small paper boat. And the old woman—now a flicker of candlelight—smiles and whispers, “Wake up.”

A sudden weightlessness seizes me. I tumble backward, feather and boat and all, through a vortex lined with every choice I made and every choice I feared to make. They scatter like glitter, fuse into constellations, and then—

I open my eyes to the whisper of early morning rain against the window. The room is quiet, ordinary, safe—but my heart still echoes with the impossible pulse of that living hospital, and I understand, dimly, that even in waking life I hold an invisible triage clipboard: deciding which moments to heal, which memories to let go, which dreams to keep alive.

For now, I choose to remember.
