I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, subterranean cavern, the air thick with the scent of earth and damp stone. The walls undulate with luminescent, bioluminescent flora, casting an eerie, dancing light across the uneven terrain. I realize there is a disturbing weight on my chest, pinning me to the dirt floor. 

As I adjust to the dim glow, I notice a familiar figure looming over me - the person who so recently offended me. Their form pyre into view illumines. Their eyes, deep black pools that bore into my soul, seem to gleam with malevolent glee. "You see, " they hisssssss, "I am the source of your distress. I shape your reality into one wrought with pain and uncertainty."  

I try to scream, but no sound escapes my lips. Panic rising, I stare around, desperate for a way out of this living nightmare. The cavern seems to bend and stretch before me as this shadowy version of my faux pas for you approaches slowly, a malevolent smile on face. "Face me, " they croon. "Face the truth." 

The truth, I realize with revulsion, is that I have fixated so heavily on this offense, nursed it, let it fester within me until it has become a malignant growth, toxic to my wellbeing and bliss. 

As this poisoned "faux ami" reaches for my throat, I suddenly feel a surge of resolve. If this adversity is of my own creation, then surely it is within my ability to destroy. 

With an inhuman roar of fury, I lunge forward and seize this figure by the throat. Bones crunch beneath my fingers, and with a final spurt of dark blood, they crumple lifelessly against me.

And I am free.

I push myself to my lanky feet, shoulders suddenly relaxed. As I gaze upon the dissipating remains of my vanquished nemesis, I feel a rush of turbulent euphoria. I have emptied myself of the toxic swamp of rumination that I allowed to dominate me. I have taken control.

And as the cavern melts away like wax beneath a talent flame, I awake, cleansed and reborn in the dawning light.
