I am dreaming. As I drift into the realm of the subconscious, I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, auroral forest. The air is charged with an otherworldly energy, heavy with the scent of ozone and jasmine. The trees, whether they be birch or cypress, seem to hum with a soft, oscillating light that travels up their trunks and blazes like stars at their crowns. It is as if each tree holds the vast essence of the cosmos within its core, pulsating with a power both alien and comforting.

As I step into the forest, the ground beneath my feet responds by molding itself to fit the contours of my skin, both the padded soles of my shoes and the delicate webbing between my toes. The earth is warm and alive, an active participant in this ethereal dance we're engaging in. With each movement forward, the forest seems to shift and reorganize itself, not out of malice but out of a desire to communicate.

I make out shapes within the auroral mist - vast, amorphous figures that seem too big for any terrestrial being to contain. These are not animals or plants but something in between, a fusion of the organic and the abstract. As I draw closer, I realize these are the manifestations of my own subconscious thoughts, taking on life and form as the forest grants them bodily existence.

They move towards me, but not in any threatening manner. Instead, they seem to want to impart information, to share with me the deep truths that lie just beyond the reach of my waking mind. Their forms shift and morph, reflecting the mental processes that spawned them. 

The first creature - if it can be called that - takes on the image of a grotesquely oversized hand, larger than a house. It point at me, then at my heart. I feel a surge of heat there, as if something is quickening its pace, growing stronger. The hand then gestures to one side, where a material manifestation of what I've been thinking logically about appears. It is a mess, full of contradictory information and dead ends.

The creature repeats the process a few more times, highlighting both that which springs from my logic and that which springs from my intuition. It's slowly dawning on me that while logic is precise and skillful, it is limited. It can only work with the information it's given, and in some cases, this information may not be enough to make an informed decision.

On the other hand, my intuition seems to contain a wealth of knowledge that logic can't access. It doesn't have the same connection to my conscious mind, and it doesn't require evidence to function. It simply knows. I am learning that in some cases, particularly when dealing with the unknown, intuition can be a powerful tool that I've left largely untapped.

The humanoid forests of luminescent mist begin to swirl and dance around me, carrying the same message - that intuition is not something to be feared or suppressed. Rather, it is an asset that should be developed and listened to, as it contains deep understandings that logic alone cannot tell us. It is a bridge between the conscious and unconscious parts, a guide that can lead me to truths beyond the reach of my waking mind.

As I wake up this message resonates within me, a meaningful movement of sense that I'll carry with me into my waking life. My intuition is a part of me, and it's time to acknowledge and embrace it.
