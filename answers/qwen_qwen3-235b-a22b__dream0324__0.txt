I am dreaming. Or rather—I have just woken from something far deeper than a dream. A descent.

The sheets cling to my skin like the memory of icy water, and my breath comes in short, ragged bursts, as if something chased me through the corridors of sleep and nearly caught me just before I woke. I press a trembling hand against my chest, steadying the chaotic rhythm of my heart, though it does little to quell the tide of fear sleeping just beneath my skin. The dream clings like night fog, thickening with every attempt to banish it.

What did I see?

No—it's not so much what I saw, but what I felt. Fear without a shape. A presence not in the room—but in the air. Rolling, insidious. The moment I blink, the memory spills behind my eyelids again, vivid as a fever-dream.

I was standing in the center of an ocean, a sea made not of water but of shifting glass, swirling darkly beneath my feet like liquid obsidian. It shimmered with the fractured reflections of myself—dozens, then hundreds of versions of *me*, each a parody, each screaming silently from the mirror-depths. Above, a sky without stars pulsed rhythmically like a heartbeat, an eerie shade of bruised violet. And I could *feel* them beneath me—those half-images—tugging at me, trying to pull me under.

I tried to walk. The glass did not break, but each step summoned a long-forgotten memory from the deep recesses of my mind—some twisted versions of reality I’d tried to forget. My mother’s voice from behind me, but colder, sharper. A version of home I didn’t recognize, with rooms that stretched endlessly, full of doorways leading nowhere. Smells I’d never smelled and yet…knew intimately. They were *mine*, warped pieces of me being offered back like a sacrifice.

The air pulsed with an inaudible hum, deep and thrumming, as if something vast and ancient were breathing just out of sync with the world. Then came the whispering.

Not with sound, but thought—each word a wet, shivering pressure at the base of my skull.

**“You do not remember. But we know you.”**

And I knew, without knowing how, that I had been here before—lured by something buried deep in my own mind, something that belonged to this strange dimension as much as to me.

Then, just before waking, I saw it. A silhouette against the endless dark of that pulsating sky. A towering shape with too many arms, shifting like smoke caught in a limp weight of oil. Eyes bloomed over its skin like wet stones opening to the moon. It stepped, and the glass trembled.

But it didn't move toward me.

It was already *inside me*.

I gasp again as full awareness floods back into me. Realized reality slaps against my trembling nerves like waking from drowning, but the memory of that *place*—that presence—still crawls along the back of my mind. Surreal and unshakable.

The dream is over.

But the fear… lingers. It stirs into every quiet moment. It watches from the edges of my thoughts.

A subtle tremor of something not so much imagined…

But remembered.
