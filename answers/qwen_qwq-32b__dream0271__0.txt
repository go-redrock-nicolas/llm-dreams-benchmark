I am dreaming. The air smells like burnt sugar and forgotten rain.  My hands tremble as I grip the obsidian staff, its surface carved with spirals that pulse in sync with my heartbeat.  The labyrinth around me glows faintly—walls made of solidified starlight, bending inward as if the very space itself is alive.  Ahead, the Heartstone floats in a vortex of iridescent mist, its core a miniature supernova that threatens to blind me if I stare too long.  I’ve trained lifetimes for this, memorized the celestial dance required to appease its power.  But as I step forward, the labyrinth shifts—a new path opens, jagged and uncharted.  My reflection in the starmetal floor flickers, and suddenly I’m not alone.
