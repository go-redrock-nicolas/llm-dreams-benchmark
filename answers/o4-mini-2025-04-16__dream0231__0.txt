I am dreaming. You drift on currents of violet-scented air, your eyelashes heavy as spinning constellations. Before you, two offerings hover in mid-air:

 • In your right hand, a tiny, luminescent amber sphere no larger than a marble. It pulses with warm promise—a handful of golden coins that clink softly when you turn it over in your palm. Immediate. Certain. A whisper of relief for tomorrow’s rent, tonight’s dinner.

 • Farther on, perched atop a crystalline pedestal, shines a vast sapphire chest bound with rose-gold filigree. Inside, treasures enough to shelter you for years—if only you can wait through four long moons. Between you and it stretches a field of glassy dunes: a slow journey, a test of patience.

A breeze, warm as a lover’s sigh, rustles through your hair. The amber sphere feels comforting, alive in your grip. You imagine pressing its warmth against your lips, hearing that soft jangling, feeling the tension in your chest ease at once. The worries you carry—past-due bills, an empty cupboard—would shrink beneath its glow.

But your gaze drifts to the distant chest. Its sapphire panels swirl with galaxies, each spark promising more than you’ve ever held. You picture unlocking it after months of pilgrimage: the rush of triumph, the weight of coins spilling like stardust across your palms, the knowledge that every step you took was rewarded tenfold.

A voice, neither yours nor wholly another’s, murmurs through the dunes: “What is comfort but a fleeting petal? What is treasure but the seed you plant today?” The sands beneath your feet feel fragile, as though the moment itself might shatter if you choose wrong.

Your heartbeat thuds. You calculate: your stomach grumbles. The amber sphere could carry you through next week—but the sapphire chest could carry you through decades. So you close your eyes and let time pool behind your eyelids, feeling patience grow in your bones like an ember waking to flame.

You slip the amber sphere into a small pouch at your waist—not to spend, but to hold you steady on the path. Then you step onto the glass dunes, each footfall shimmering in promise. And as you walk, the night sky bends low to watch, giving you strength to chase that distant glow.
