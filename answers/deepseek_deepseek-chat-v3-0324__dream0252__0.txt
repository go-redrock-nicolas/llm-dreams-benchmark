I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of an endless desert, where the golden sands stretch toward a horizon that shimmers like liquid mercury. The air is thick with the scent of petrichor—though it hasn’t rained, the earth seems to remember the touch of water. Above me, the sky is a swirling canvas of indigo and violet, pierced by a crescent moon so sharp it could cut glass. Stars pulse like living embers, whispering secrets in a language just beyond comprehension.  

A wind rises, carrying the faint sound of distant laughter—childlike, unburdened. It tugs at my clothes, as if urging me forward. I take a step, and the sand beneath my feet compresses like memory foam, but with each subsequent step, it hardens into glass, reflecting fragments of my own face—some tear-streaked, some laughing, some contorted in silent screams. The shards shift and rearrange, forming a mosaic of my shifting emotions.  

Then, the desert begins to bloom. Flowers—impossible, iridescent—erupt from the cracked earth, petals unfolding like whispers given form. Their colors shift with my heartbeat: cool blues when I inhale, blazing reds when I exhale. One flower, larger than the rest, pulses with an inner light. I reach for it, and as my fingers brush its velvet surface, it bursts into a cloud of glittering pollen, each speck a tiny mirror reflecting not my face, but moments—some real, some imagined. A childhood triumph, an unseen kindness, a future yet unlived.  

The wind shifts again, this time carrying a melody—a wordless hum that resonates in my bones. It’s coming from a figure in the distance, silhouetted against the dying light. They’re dancing, limbs moving with the fluid grace of a river finding its way home. As I drift closer, I realize the dancer is both stranger and self, wearing my face but also every face I’ve ever loved. They extend a hand, and when our fingers touch, the desert flips inside out. Suddenly, I’m standing in a vast library, where the books rearrange themselves according to my breath. One floats down, opening to a page that reads, *"The weight of failure is just the universe’s way of pressing you into something stronger. You are the ink, the story, and the hand that writes it."*  

The dancer’s voice—my voice—whispers, *"Now, wake."* And I do, gasping, as dawn spills like honey across my bedroom walls. The residue of the dream lingers—a scent of flowers, a hum in my chest—but the despair has dissolved, replaced by something quieter, fiercer: the determination to keep moving, to embrace the mess of becoming.  

(How does the dream leave you feeling? Do you carry any remnants of it—a color, a sound, a phrase?)
