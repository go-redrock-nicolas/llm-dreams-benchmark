I am dreaming.

There is a restless vibrancy in the air, like the crackle before a thunderstorm, pulling me toward a dilapidated, vine-entwined studio at the edge of a moonlit marsh. Though my waking self has never sculpted, I find my hands inexorably reaching for cool, slick clay among the shadows. There is no one here, only the soft sigh of evening winds and the croak of unseen frogs. I am oddly certain I have no talent—my previous attempts at art have always ended in frustration and awkward half-formed things. But this ache to create will not ease. It sings low and persistent behind my ribs. 

Under the witch-glow of a swollen moon, I press my palms into the clay. The studio is alive with echoing memories: the faint sound of a chime, sketches on crumbling paper, the sandy smell of time. My fingers work—their own intelligence guiding them in movements I do not fully control or understand. My mind feels elsewhere as, again and again, I return to this place, each night compelled to form rough bowls, strange birds, swirling shells not found in any ocean.

All doubts slip away in the dreamstate: instead, there is only curiosity, play, and the heady rush of making something from nothing, of conjuring new shapes out of formlessness. Some nights, I stay until dawn seeps pink through dusty windows. Sometimes, the objects I create crack or slouch in strange, imperfect ways—but I find myself drawn to those flaws, as if the mistakes are hidden messages I must decipher.

One morning, as birds begin to chatter among the twisting vines, I notice the surfaces of my haphazard creations gleam with faint, opalescent patterns. Spirals shimmer across them, like runes or constellations, as if my fingers—unguided by skill—have become conduits for some deeper artistry I cannot yet explain.

There in the hushed sanctum of that secret studio, self-doubt dissolves into wonder. The pursuit becomes a kind of devotion: joyful, unruly, alive. I awaken with my heart thrumming—not with the pride of mastery, but with the fierce, luminous satisfaction of answering the call of something wild and unnamed inside me.
