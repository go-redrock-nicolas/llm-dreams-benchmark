I am dreaming. The air is heavy with the scent of rain-soaked timber, a smell that makes my nose tingle as I stand in the entryway of my childhood home.  My sneakers squeak against a floorboard that shouldn't be there anymore—it buckled under weight years ago, or maybe it's a new problem.  The walls are breathing.

That's when I notice it: the cracks. Not the usual hairline fractures from settling foundations, but deep, snaking fissures that spiral up the brick facade like the veins of some ancient, slumbering beast.  Plaster crumbles in great, grey chunks, revealing the sinewy metal rebar beneath—naked and exposed, as if the house is stripping itself bare.  I flatten my palm against the wall, and it vibrates faintly, like a harp string waiting to be plucked.

There's a sound now, a low hum beneath the creaking floorboards and the drip-drip of moisture leaking through the ceiling.  It's rhythmic, almost a purr, emanating from the basement.  I descend the stairs, each step groaning in protest, to find the basement door ajar.  The space beyond is flooded with an unearthly light, a glacial blue that doesn't come from lamps or windows.  The foundation walls glisten with bioluminescent moss, each filament throbbing like capillaries.

In the center of the chamber stands a pedestal of black stone, atop it rests a key ornately carved from something that resembles onyx.  Etched into its surface are symbols that twist and morph before my eyes—instantly familiar yet impossible to decipher.  A voice whispers in my ear, not from any direction I can detect, but from the hollow spaces between the beams: *“The structure decides its own fate, little architect.  Will you merely observe… or become living mortar?”*
