I am dreaming. …teach your own body to blur its boundaries.

First you inhale—not air, but a luminous fog that sparkles like ground-up constellations.  The mist seeps through your skin, rearranging your atoms into something halfway between water and moonlight.  Your arms ripple, their edges shimmering; your fingers drip into silvery droplets that hover in mid-air before knitting themselves back together as crystalline claws.  You have become phase-fluid—able to answer every substance with an answering state.

You step forward onto a river that is at once a glass bridge and a flowing stream and a billowing ribbon of steam.  Each footfall must choose the proper dialogue: solidity for grip, liquidity for buoyancy, vapor for weightlessness.  So you think “stone” and the sole of your foot calcifies, then you think “current” and it melts, passing harmlessly through the water that is also glass.  The steam threads curl around your ankles, purring like warm cats.

Ahead rises a forest of triphase trees: trunks of transparent ice that pulse with glowing sap, leaves that are clouds of scented aerosol, branches that sound like wind chimes forged from quicksilver.  You reach toward a leaf, and it bursts into rain, then refreezes as a snowflake on your fingertip, then lifts away as a breath of perfume tasting of eucalyptus and stardust.

A guide appears—at least, you sense it before you see it.  It is a prism-skinned mantis whose exoskeleton is neither armor nor vapor nor water but all three interfolded.  It speaks in oscillations of temperature.  Warmth means welcome; coolness, caution.  You warm your chest in reply, a bow made of infrared.  Satisfied, the mantis taps your brow with an antenna that crackles like fresh ice cubes dropped into magma.  Instantly an alphabet blooms behind your eyelids: glyphs that morph among shapes, droplets, and smoke rings.  This is the language of the realm—every word a triple exposure.  You can read it now.

You journey together toward the Multiplex, the heart of this world, where possibilities nucleate.  The ground beneath becomes a mirror-lake-cloud, reflecting you from three temporal angles: who you were, who you are, who you might become if you master the tri-state dance.  The reflections argue in silence; each suggests a different future.  You listen to them by tasting their flavors—crunch of ice for the past, fizz of steam for the present, smooth velvet water for tomorrow.

At the Multiplex you find a fountain that erupts upward as marble pillars, coughs sideways as geysers, and exhales outward as ringlets of fog—one eruption, three faces.  The mantis raises a claw, inviting you to drink.  When you sip, the liquid-solid-vapor slides down your throat in three separate sensations: a cold pebble, a warm draught, a cool breeze.  Your heartbeat calibrates itself to a triple rhythm, and suddenly you know how to command the states at will.

You clap your hands.  Where they meet, a sphere appears: frozen crust, liquid core, gaseous halo.  It pulses like a neutron star and shrinks to a jewel that you slot into your sternum.  The realm responds, rippling in approval.  The triphase trees bow; the river-bridge hums three octaves at once; clouds condense into crystalline applause.

You realize this is not merely a place but a blueprint for adaptability.  Every contradiction can coexist if coaxed into harmony.  Every obstacle holds three secret passages: solid to climb, liquid to swim, vapor to float.  You feel as if your dreams—back in the waking world—have been upgraded with hidden dimensions, and you vow to carry this knowledge home.

The mantis guide flares into prismatic vapor, saluting you.  The forest dissolves into effervescent snow.  The river rises as glass stairs that spiral into the sky, then melt, then lift you like updrafts beneath a gull’s wings.  You ascend, phase-shifting with each breath—stone, water, cloud, stone, water, cloud—until the realm thins to a mist of possibility and you tumble upward…

…waking with dew on your palms, smoke in your hair, and a pebble-solid certainty in your heart that reality, too, can learn to be multiform when you dare to touch it in three ways at once.
