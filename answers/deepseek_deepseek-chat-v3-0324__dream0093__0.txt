I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric tension as I stand in the center of a vast, crystalline library—its towering shelves spiral endlessly into a swirling nebula overhead. Each book pulses with an inner glow, their covers etched in iridescent runes that shift and recompose as I reach for them. The texts sprawl across infinite disciplines: quantum physics murmurs in spectral equations that hover above the pages; ancient botanical wisdom seeps through vines sprouting from illuminated herbals; symphonies of forgotten languages vibrate as I brush my fingers against scrolls of liquid metal.  

But as I try to absorb them all—*needing* them all—the knowledge rebels. Equations slither like mercury, evading my grasp. The vines twist around my wrists, thorns pricking as they whisper secrets too densely layered to parse. The library itself begins to *breathe*, shelves contracting like ribs, and the floor undulates beneath me, melting into a mosaic of half-formed schematics and fractured timelines.  

A mirror-black pool wells up between the cracks, reflecting not my face but a thousand fragmented versions of me—each drowning in a different discipline, drowning in *understanding*. A chorus of voices crescendos: *"You cannot hold it all"*—yet somehow, beneath the terror, there’s a lure in the chaos. The overload isn’t obliterating me; it’s *reweaving* me.  

And then—  

A single thread of clarity. The chaos stills just long enough for me to *choose*. Not to consume, but to *connect*. The disciplines start speaking *through* one another: celestial mechanics sings in the syntax of poetry; neural networks bloom like mycelial networks, their pathways mirroring the library’s own living architecture. The dream shudders, and I realize—  

The challenge was never to contain the knowledge. It was to let the knowledge contain *me*.  

I wake gasping, the taste of stardust and ink still on my tongue.
