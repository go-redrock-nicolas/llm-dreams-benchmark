I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of burnt sugar and distant thunder. I’m standing at the edge of a labyrinth made of living coral, its branches pulsing faintly like bruised veins under translucent skin. The ground is spongy beneath my feet, each step leaving a print that fills with liquid starlight. Above, the sky is a swirling mosaic of amethyst and opal, shifting as if stirred by invisible hands. I hear laughter—high and crystalline—coming from the center of the maze. A voice, both familiar and alien, whispers, *“Follow the glowthorn.”* 

I step forward. The coral walls hum in response, their hues deepening where I touch them. A trail of bioluminescent moss leads me onward, glowing brighter as I move. My breath quickens. At each turn, the maze seems to contract, drawing me closer. Suddenly, I find myself face-to-face with a door carved from obsidian, its hinges wrapped in serpentine ivy. The handle is a small brass key, warm to the touch, vibrating with static energy. When I grasp it, my hand passes through the door. It’s dreams, I remember—nothing here is solid. But curiosity outweighs caution.

The door opens inward. Inside, a room without walls. The ceiling stretches infinitely upward, speckled with constellations unfamiliar yet hauntingly familiar. A piano sits center stage, its keys made of polished moonstone. Beside it rests a journal bound in iridescent moth wings. The laughter rings again, softer now, almost sorrowful. *“Play the song that never ends,”* the voice urges. 

The keys are cool beneath my fingers. Hesitant, I press the middle key. A note resonates, sharp and pure, and the stars above rearrange themselves into patterns. Each subsequent note I play shifts the constellations further, their light pooling on the journal’s pages. I stop, breathless. The journal’s cover opens autonomously, revealing pages filled with my handwriting, detailing life events I don’t remember: childhood summers on a lake that glows at night, a best friend who vanished into mist without a trace, a first heartbreak etched in cursive ink sharper than knives. 

Tears well up. The voice murmurs again, *“This is where memories go when they’re afraid to be found.”* 

A door materializes behind me. It mirrors the first—obsidian and ivy—but now its handle is a silver violin bow. I pick it up. The bow trembles. Beyond the door, I can see the coral maze again, but it’s crumbling, dissolving into ash that floats upward like dandelion seeds. 

The dream is slipping. I clutch the violin bow tighter. The world dissolves into sound—a crescendo of whispers, the hum of forgotten hymns, the static of unmade choices. When I open my eyes, morning light spills through my blinds, painting the room in gold. The scent of burnt sugar lingers on my tongue.
