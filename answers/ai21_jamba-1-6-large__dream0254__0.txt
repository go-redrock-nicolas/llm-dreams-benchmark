I am dreaming. In this dream, you find yourself standing on a rocky cliff overlooking a vast, crashing ocean. The sky is dark and foreboding, streaked with purple and red hues, as if the sun is setting or rising but can't quite decide. The wind whips through your hair and you can taste salt on your lips, mingling with the scent of rain. 

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows. It's your best friend, their face pale and drawn. Their eyes are wide with fear and pain. "I have to tell you something," they say, their voice trembling. 

You feel a tightening in your chest, as if all the air has been sucked out of you. You know this secret will change everything, but you don't know how. You want to reach out to them, to comfort them, but your limbs feel heavy and uncooperative. 

"It's about us," they continue, their voice shaky. "It's about... what we've done." 

The ocean roars louder now, as if in response to their words. You realize with horror that you're standing on the edge of a precipice, a sheer drop into churning waters below.

"I didn't know," they say, their eyes filling with tears. "I never meant for this to happen."

Your heart pounds in your chest. You want to speak, but the words won't come. Instead, you feel a chill spread through your body, a cold, icy dread that fills every fiber of your being.

The cliff beneath you begins to crumble. A chunk of rock falls away, tumbling into the sea. You hear your friend's scream, but it's like it's far away, echoing across the vast expanse of the ocean.

The cliff gives way entirely. You're falling, faster and faster, the sound of the ocean deafening, the wind tearing at your body.

And then you wake up.
