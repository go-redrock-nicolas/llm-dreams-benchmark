I am dreaming. The world around me has become a shifting kaleidoscope of half-formed colors and trembling shadows. The air tastes of ozone and salt, and every breath feels like pulling shards of glass through my lungs. Beneath my feet, the floor dissolves into a misty void, and ahead of me yawns the very thing I dread most: an endless, roiling chasm of pitch-black water. 

Waves of darkness ripple across its surface as if alive, each crest revealing phantom faces screaming in silent anguish. The wind carries their whispers—half-remembered voices of friends long gone, accusing me of crimes I haven’t committed. My skin prickles; my heart thunders so loud I fear it might burst from my chest. 

As panic threatens to overwhelm me, I feel my muscles lock, my legs refusing to move. The chasm’s lip creaks beneath my weight. I can smell the salt spray, taste the brine on my tongue. In the distance, a pale, phosphorescent hand arcs out of the water, fingers splayed wide, beckoning. With each heave of the sea, the hand drags itself higher, inch by slippery inch. 

My throat closes. I try to scream, but only a gurgle escapes. My vision narrows to that single, ghostly limb climbing toward me. The wind tears at my hair, and the mist coils around my ankles like living vines, threatening to yank me into the abyss. Every instinct screams to flee, but there is nowhere to run—only the void and that hand. 

Then, just as my senses fracture under the weight of dread, a tiny spark ignites inside me: the thought of warmth, of waking breath, of the morning sun on my face. I clutch at that spark, fanning it into a flame. I remind myself that this is a dream—that even the darkest horrors here cannot truly harm me. 

With that realization burning in my chest, I step back. The mist recoils; the water’s surface stills. The ghostly hand hesitates, then dissolves into a swirl of silver foam. I breathe, deeply and deliberately, anchoring myself to the waking world. The chasm’s roar fades to nothing. 

And then I am falling—softly, weightless—through a tunnel of warm light. My heart slows, time stretches, and at the end of that glowing corridor, I feel a gentle hand brush my shoulder, guiding me toward the surface of consciousness. I wake with a gasp, drenched in sweat, yet filled with the fierce relief of having faced the thing I feared most—and survived.
