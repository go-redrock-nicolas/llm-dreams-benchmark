I am dreaming. You receive life-altering news that triggers a storm of emotions within you. As others watch for your reaction, you take a moment to collect yourself and decide how you want to respond. You choose to speak calmly and kindly, despite feeling hurt an angry. You express empathy towards the messenger and ask clarifying questions to understand the situation better. You end the conversation with grace and dignity, leaving others impressed by your poise and maturity.
You wake up from the dream feeling proud of yourself for handling the situation well.
