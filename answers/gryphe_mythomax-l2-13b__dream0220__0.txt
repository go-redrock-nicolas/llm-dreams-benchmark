I am dreaming. I find myself in a vibrant city filled with unique architecture, colorful streets, and a bustling energy unlike anything I've ever experienced. As I explore this new world, I stumble upon a subculture that has relationship norms completely reversed from what I'm used to. 

In this society, what I consider impolite is actually revered and seen as the ultimate sign of respect. For instance, interrupting someone's conversation or invading their personal space is considered the height of etiquette here. On the other hand, I observe people expressing genuine gratitude for rude behavior.

As I navigate through this fascinating culture, I realize that maintaining my authenticity while integrating with them would be quite challenging. I watch in awe as the locals engage in daring acts of rudeness, laughing wholeheartedly at the shocked reactions of those they encounter.

Despite the initial confusion, I decide to embrace this new way of being. I push myself to bring out my own inner rudeness, surprising myself with how easy it is to adapt. I find that my interactions with others become more genuine and authentic, as I no longer feel the need to mask my true feelings.

As the days pass, I become more entrenched in this subculture, learning their customs and traditions. I begin to understand the beauty in their perspective on life, realizing that sometimes being polite can rob us of true connection. This dream has challenged me to reevaluate my own definition of politeness and reminded me to always strive for authenticity in my relationships.
