I am dreaming. You find yourself drifting through a vast, moonlit desert of rippling silver dunes. The sand beneath your feet glows faintly, like stars strewn across the earth, and every footstep sends gentle pulses of light racing outward. Above you, the sky shifts in rippling ribbons of emerald and violet, as if painted by a celestial artist who can’t decide on a single hue. A hush reigns, yet you feel a peculiar vibration in the air—a beckoning, an invitation to look closer.

Up ahead, a towering obelisk of polished onyx rises from the sands. Carved into its face is an ancient symbol you once regarded with unwavering certainty—an emblem of your most deeply held political conviction. As you approach, the symbol begins to fracture, its rigid lines dissolving into motes of golden dust. They swirl upward like fireflies, revealing behind them a hidden mural: sprawling scenes of human kindness and compassion that you’d never allowed yourself to see before. Each vignette—neighbors sharing meals across divides, strangers extending hands in solidarity—evokes a warmth in your chest, and for the first time, you feel your certainty waver.

In the hush that follows, the dunes around you come alive. Shapes emerge—faces of people you fiercely argued against, eyes glistening with hope rather than hostility. They speak wordlessly, their voices a chorus of gentle chimes that resonate inside your skull. A single phrase repeats itself: “Truth is wider than the walls we build.” The phrase echoes so clearly that your heartbeat slows to match its rhythm. You recognize it as the evidence that challenged you: stories, statistics, testimonies you had dismissed—or never fully absorbed—until now.

As the chimes fade, the desert begins to shift again. The onyx obelisk cracks open like a seed pod, spilling its inner light across the sands. You feel a tug at your core, a twisting sensation of bones and beliefs rearranging themselves. There is discomfort—an ache that travels from your spine up into your throat—but it’s accompanied by a strange exhilaration, as though you’re being reborn with a broader vision. You taste the faint tang of ozone, and the violet sky bleeds fully into emerald, as if the world itself is adjusting to the newly expanded boundary of your mind.

Finally, you stand alone in the soft glow of dawn. The dunes have smoothed themselves into gentle waves of pale rose, and the sky holds a single, radiant star. Nothing seems impossible here; even your most entrenched beliefs feel supple, alive, open to change. You close your eyes, inhaling the desert air, and allow the memory of the mural’s scenes to settle in your heart. As you do, the star above pulses once—and you wake, carrying with you a flicker of that boundless landscape, and a whisper that growth often begins where certainty cracks.
