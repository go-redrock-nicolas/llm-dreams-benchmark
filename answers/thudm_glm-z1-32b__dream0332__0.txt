I am dreaming. I am lying on the back of a giant, translucent whale that swims endlessly through a vast, star-strewn ocean.  The whale's skin is like swirling galaxies, and its immense body ripples with the light of distant suns.  Around me, bioluminescent fish dart like falling stars, their scales reflecting the constellations above.  The ocean itself is liquid time, swirling with eddies of centuries and streaks of moments.  In my pocket, a crumpled newspaper floats with the headlines "All Empires Decay into Slime" in glowing, ever-changing ink. This truth pulses against the comforting lie that power structures are inherently stable.  The whale suddenly veers toward a of black water, its maw gaping.  I hold my breath as we plummet into what feels like the collective unconscious.
