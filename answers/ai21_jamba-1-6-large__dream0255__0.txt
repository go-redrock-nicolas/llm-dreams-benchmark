I am dreaming. In this dream, I am flying through a vast mountain range, the peaks shrouded in clouds of gold and violet. Below me, rivers of shimmering blue meander through valleys so lush with emerald greenery it almost hurts to look at them. The air is warm and scented with flowers and spices that don't exist in the waking world, and when I breathe, I can feel it settle into my chest like pure, comforting love.
 
I'm heading towards something, though I'm not sure what. There's an electric spark in the dream, like the fizz and crackle of anticipation before something important. As I glance down at the earth beneath me, I see the outline of a vast city built into the sides of the mountains. Its spires and bridges and tunnels glow faintly, like the light of stars that have traveled thousands of years to reach the surface. People move about in a rhythm that feels like the pulse of a beating heart.
 
My flight slows, and I land gently on the ground, feet touching a path paved with stones that shimmer like sapphires and amethysts. There's no pain—no exhaustion or fear or anger, and standing here feels more real than the waking world. It's a place that welcomes me, where time doesn't seem to matter, and nothing seems overwhelming or rushed.
 
And in the dream, there's music. Not music like in the world, of course, but something softer and wilder, like the sound of memories playing inside my head. The dream shifts around me, and I move, walking through streets that twist and turn in ways that shouldn't make sense but do. I come to rest by a fountain where water falls in slow, curved arcs of liquid light, pooling into a still basin.
 
In the water, I see a reflection. Someone I know, someone I care about, but in the reflection, there's something... more. They laugh, it's bright and cheerful, but beneath that, I can sense something else. They're hiding something—a tug of sadness, maybe, or a quiet longing. The reflection smiles, and the smile doesn't quite reach their eyes.
 
I want to reach out, want to say something, but how do you offer comfort when they haven't even admitted anything is wrong?
 
The dream doesn't give answers, but it feels like it's urging me to be there. Everything around me—the mountains, the city, the music—seems to hum a quiet reassurance. So I stand there, waiting. In the dream, I reach out to them, and for once, it isn't about fixing things or figuring things out. It's about the fact that they don't have to be alone.
 
The dream begins to fade—the colors, the sounds, the warmth all dissolve into the ether of sleep, but the sensation stays. Because even in dreams, sometimes you remember that sometimes, the best thing you can do for someone is to stand by them, patient and steady, even when they’re not ready to speak.
