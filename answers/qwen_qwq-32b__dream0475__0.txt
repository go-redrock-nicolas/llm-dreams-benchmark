I am dreaming. I see myself walking through a long corridor.  The walls are lined with mirrors, but they're not reflecting my face. Instead, each mirror shows a different version of me facing an impossible scenario. One shows me trapped in a collapsing library; another shows me shrinking into a puddle of my own tears.  The third reveals me giving a speech to an audience of stone faces; when I open my mouth to speak, silence echoes.  I quicken my pace, wanting to flee the oppressive weight of these visions.  But another mirror catches my eye—a smaller one at the end of the corridor.  Inside it, a figure beckons me.  "These aren't your truths," they say.  "They’re projections of fear."  The voice sounds like my own but deeper, older.  When I reach for the glass, my hand phases through it—and suddenly I’m standing in a meadow under a starlit sky.  The air hums with bioluminescent fireflies.  A river of liquid light winds through the grass.  The figure from the mirror stands beside me, their form shifting like living water.  They hand me a seed.  "Plant it," they command.  I press the glowing seed into the soil.  Almost instantly, a tree erupts from the ground—the roots spread rapidly, touching every star.  Leaves made of stained glass shimmer in colors that don’t have names.  At the top of the, the seed becomes a lantern filled with all the voices of my anxieties, now softened and subdued.  The figure smiles.  "You see? They weren’t endings. They were roots."
