I am dreaming. You're in a beautiful park surrounded by green trees and flowers. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting warm light on everything around you. You feel calm and peaceful here, far away from the stress of work or school. You are dreaming.
You're walking through the park, enjoying the sights and sounds around you. A friendly squirrel approaches you, holding a nut in its paw. It seems to be offering it to you as a gift. You take it gratefully and crack open the shell using your teeth. The nut meat tastes delicious and nutritious.
You feel energized now and continue walking through the park until you reach a river flowing nearby. You sit by its edge, dipping your feet into its cool waters. A fish swims up to them, nibbling at your toes playfully. You laugh and splash some water onto yourself and the fish swims away happyily.
You feel refreshed now and continue walking through the park until you reach a hill overlooking everything around you. You climb up to its top where there's a bench waiting for you. You sit down on it, enjoying the view of the park below. A bird lands on the branch next to you, singing sweetly.
You feel content now and close your eyes, taking a nap in this serene place.

You open your eyes again, feeling refreshed and invigorated. You stand up from the bench and stretch your body. You look around for the bird that woke you up but it's gone now. You shrug it off and continue walking down the hill towards the park below. 
You see a group of people playing games near the river. They seem to be having fun. You decide to join them too. As you approach, they notice you and wave hello. They invite you to play with them and introduce themselves one by one: Sarah, Mark, Tom, Jane, etc. 
They show you how to play their game which involves throwing a ball into a basket in the river. You try it but miss several times. They encourage you and give you tips on how to improve your aim. You thank them and try again. This time, you succeed! The ball goes into the basket and they cheer for you.
You feel proud now and continue playing with them until it's time to go home. 
As you leave, they exchange contact information with each other and ask for yours too. They promise to hang out again soon and invite you along. You agree happily and say goodbye. 
As you walk away from the park, you feel a sense of camaraderie and friendship forming between you and them. Maybe this was not such a bad dream after all...
