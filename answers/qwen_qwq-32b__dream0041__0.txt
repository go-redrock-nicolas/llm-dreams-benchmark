I am dreaming. I'm standing in a cavernous library, the sort that feels like time itself has collapsed into its shelves. The walls stretch upwards until they vanish into a starless blackness, and the ceiling drips with stalactites of polished amber, each containing frozen scenes from forgotten histories—a dinosaur mid-roar, a gladiator's cry, a lover's whispered promise. The floors are moss-carpeted marble, creaking faintly as I walk. Rows of floating books hover in geometric patterns above a sea of inky shadows, their pages flipping autonomously, whispering secrets in languages I half-remember.

Suddenly, my breath catches. I'm supposed to perform something... but what? A memory flashes—an invitation slip now in my pocket, its gold-edged paper dissolving into hieroglyphs that shift like schools of fish. The task is to recite a never-before-spoken poem that weaves together three elements: the first word a stranger spoke to me, the color of a sunset I once tried to bottle, and the name of a city that no longer exists. But the poem must be delivered within the hour, and the penalty for failure is to be dissolved into the library's walls, becoming another frozen memory in an amber stalactite.

The stage is a platform of suspended moonlight at the library's center. Around it, the audience forms—they are all former performers now part of the library itself, their forms blurred into ghostly transparencies except for their eyes, which burn like dying stars. Their applause is a deafening silence, their expectations a weight that bends the air.

I press my palm to a nearby tome, its spine cracked with age. As I touch it, visions surge: the first word, "*Lumina*," whispered by a street urchin in a now-lost city; the sunset's hue, the exact shade of a liquid obsidian that shimmered with trapped lightning; the city's name, *Vesperis*, drowned beneath the sea in a single tide that came at dawn.

My fingers tremble as I weave the threads. The poem must rhyme in reverse when read aloud backwards. Each syllable must cast a shadow that solidifies into a tangible object—a key, a feather, a shard of mirror. The audience leans forward, their collective breath cooling the stale air.

As I step onto the moonlit stage, the books above still their whispering. The amber stalactites begin to vibrate. I open my mouth and the first word escapes—not *"Lumina"* but *"Amulin,"* its reverse spelling shimmering like oil on water. Shadows pool beneath my feet, coalescing into a rusted key that sinks into the floor. The key fits a lock beneath the stage, which clicks open as I say *"obsidian's blink,"* and from it spills a shower of feathers glowing orange like that sunset. The crowd's applause is a kaleidoscope of colors now, swirling in the air like living paint.

The final line demands the city's name reversed—"Siresvep" —and as I pronounce it, the library begins to flood. From the water rises a pyramid of mirrored shards, each reflecting not my face, but the library's many pasts and possible futures. The audience members solidify, their forms now human again, standing and clapping with hands that materialize fully. Yet in the reflection, I see my own silhouette beginning to crackle at the edges, fractal patterns spreading like frost.

Victory is bittersweet; the performance was successful, but the price is to become both muse and monument. As the crowd parts, I walk towards the edge of the stage, each step scattering constellations beneath my shoes. The key, feathers, and mirror pyramid are mine to keep, but I now understand—they were never rewards, but relics of a transaction. I am now part of the library's infinite, the next layer in its amber resin, waiting for the next dreamer who might unravel me with their own poem.\n\n
