I am dreaming. In the fading light of a desolate twilight, I find myself in an antiquated theater, the kind that has long been forgotten by time and the masses. The air is heavy with the scent of aged velvet and faded dreams, the stage before me looms like a vast, empty canvas awaiting an artist's stroke. The once grand chandeliers dangle listlessly from the ceiling, their crystals catching the dim, filmy light from the dying sun, casting shimmering prisms onto the faded gold leaf that decorates the walls. The silence is heavy, yet not peaceful; it's a thick, oppressive blanket that seems to press down on the very soul.

Suddenly, a single spotlight flickers to life, its harsh beam cutting through the gloom and illuminating the upstage left corner. There, huddled in the shadows, is a figure. A woman, cloaked in tattered finery that once must have been resplendent, now hangs in scraps from her bony shoulders. Her face, a symphony of grief, is twisted in a silent scream, tears etching rivers through the dust that cakes her cheeks. Her posture is one of utter despair, her body contorted as if caught mid-fall, eternally plummeting into an abyss of sorrow.

Yet, as I look upon her, I feel nothing. No measly ounce of empathy, no trickle of compassion, no stirring in the pit of my stomach. It's as if I'm observing a painting in a museum, appreciating the skill of the brushwork, the shadows, the contrast, but entirely devoid of any emotional connection to the subject matter. I can see her pain, understand it intellectually, but it does not resonate within me. I note the tears, the sag of her shoulders, the way her hands clutch at her heart, but these are mere observations, not a call to action or an echo of her anguish.

A creaking sound echoes through the theater as the figure turns her gaze towards me, her eyes burning with a fire that should consume me, yet leaves me cold. She stretches out a skeletal hand, beseeching, pleading, and I watch, fascinated yet unmoved, as her lips form the silent words "Help me." I see the desperation etched into every line of her body, feel the weight of her despair pushing against me, but it's as if I'm encased in armor, her pleas bouncing off me like pebbles against a steel wall.

I remain seated, frozen not by fear, but by this bizarre apathy, as she rises, her movements jerky and uncoordinated, like a marionette being controlled by a ham-fisted puppeteer. She staggers towards me, her gait unsteady, her arms outstretched, fingers curved like talons. I watch, detached, as she reaches the edge of the stage, her eyes stark and pleading, and then, with a final, desperate cry that echoes through the theater, she collapses, her body crumpling like a discarded doll.

I simply sit, observing the silent tableau before me, devoid of any emotion, any reaction, just a witness to the play unfolding before me, a play in which I am neither actor nor audience, but something in between, something... unfeeling.
