I am dreaming. I stand backstage, shrouded in the shadows of velvet curtains that sway like whispering ghosts behind me. The air is electric with tension and the scent of aged wood, makeup, and sweat. Somewhere beyond that curtain, an audience shifts in velvet seats, the murmur rising and falling like the tide before a storm. My heart thumps against my ribs—wild, uncontrolled—but my limbs feel oddly light, as though spun from gossamer and glowing embers.

A hand abruptly presses into my arm. The assistant, pale-faced and disheveled, eyes wide with crisis. *“They can’t go on,”* they say, breath half-missing. “*The maestro… collapsed mid-dress rehearsal. No one else… You’re next.*” It takes me a moment to understand. Me—*me*—I’m the understudy? I never signed on for this, didn’t even know the name of the performance until now, and suddenly the world tilts beneath my feet like the deck of a ship sunk too deep in starless waters.

Steps echo. A mirror glows with gentle firelight around its gilded edges, and suddenly I’m no longer me. My reflection reveals a version of myself I’ve never seen—glorious, garbed in midnight threads stitched with starlight and silver glyphs that shimmer when I breathe. My eyes burn with inner fire yet carry the softness of painted landscapes. I don’t recognize this face fully, and yet… it feels *mine*.

Music begins, drifting toward me like a siren song. Strings first—delicate, like spiders weaving gossamer across autumn leaves. Then wind instruments sighing like distant ancestors, and drums arriving like the heartbeat of the planet beneath my feet. The current of the melody grabs hold of me, chilling and thrilling in equal measure. I don't remember rehearsing, but somehow my body does. Steps rehearsed a thousand lives ago rise like smoke in my mind.

The curtains part.

There is no stage. There is only sky. I stand at the center of a vast cosmic amphitheater of interwoven stone and star, the audience perched on mountains and lunar branches overhead. Their faces are clouded and opalescent, half-formed gods and long-lost ancestors watching in fragile silence. Below, the earth stirs like a memory about to surface.

I dance. Not ballet, not hip hop, not modern, not kathak, but something ancient and unnameable—jointed limbs not mine move me, cradled by invisible hands, guided by chants I’ve never learned but suddenly *know*. A golden rain begins to fall, coaxing tiny rippling pools across the floor, and with each step I make, new stars ignite overhead. My movements shape a song older than memory, and the crowd watches, silent and stunned—at once my contemporaries and born a thousand millennia ahead.

A figure materializes through the smoke—tall, robed in shades of aether, and crowned with flame. It is the one who fell ill, the legendary performer whose greatness I was being asked to fill. But in this dream, they do not appear angry. They are smiling… almost reverent, as if watching the rebirth of something precious through me.

The crescendo rises—not of instruments alone, but of wind, of thunder caught in jars, of voices from deep sleep. I spin, faster now, faster than thought, my momentum sending diamonds spiraling through the atmosphere. With one final leap, I vanish. Not disappear—but ignite into song. Flesh becomes music. Movement becomes poetry. I *am* the performance.

And when I awaken, the dream lingers like an echo of thunder long after the storm. And somewhere, mindlessly, I begin to hum a celestial melody, my fingers dancing with shadows only I can see.
