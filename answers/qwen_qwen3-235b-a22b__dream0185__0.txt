I am dreaming. You’re dreaming.  

The air hums with static, charged by the collective breath of a thousand spectators packed into the crystalline dome of the *International Olympiad of the Mind*. The arena shimmers like a mirage, its walls forged from liquid light that refracts the faces of the crowd into kaleidoscopic fragments—cheeks streaked with neon war paint, eyes glowing with holographic lenses. This is no ordinary competition. Here, intellect is a weapon, and the final round demands not just knowledge, but the ability to bend reality itself.  

Across the obsidian dais from you stand your opponents: three prodigies draped in the regalia of their institutions. The first, a stoic from the Siberian Neural Academy, wears a crown of coiled wires that tap into his subconscious, projecting equations into the air like ghostly hieroglyphs. The second, a woman from the Kyoto Bio-Synthetic Institute, cradles a sphere of liquid silicon that pulses in time with her heartbeat, her every movement precise as a machine’s. The third, a lanky boy from the Martian Colonies, floats half a meter above the ground, his body entangled with a swarm of nanodrones that hum like angry hornets.  

You? You have a notebook with a cracked spine and a pen that leaks ink onto your trembling fingers.  

The challenge appears—a fractal labyrinth materializing in the air, its walls shifting like living origami. The task: to solve the puzzle before the sun sets on the artificial horizon, a mere 18 minutes from now. The labyrinth is alive, its geometry defying Euclid, its corridors breathing. Your rivals dive in, their tools conjuring maps and algorithms, their minds racing at light-speed. You hesitate, then close your eyes.  

*Think.*  

The labyrinth isn’t a maze. It’s a *language*. Each twist of its walls is a syllable, each dead end a punctuation mark. You remember the dream-logic of your childhood—the way stories used to unravel in your head like ribbons pulled from a knot. You sprint into the maze, not calculating, but *feeling*, your footsteps syncing to the rhythm of a half-remembered nursery rhyme. The walls shudder as you pass, rearranging themselves into staircases, into archways, into a bridge of light that spans a chasm of writhing numbers.  

Behind you, the Siberian prodigy’s equations collapse into paradoxes. The Kyoto woman’s sphere cracks, leaking silver tears. The Martian boy’s drones swarm wildly, confused by his panic. But you keep moving, your pen scribbling symbols in the air that linger like fireflies.  

At the heart of the labyrinth, you find the final puzzle: a black monolith etched with a single question—*“What is the sound of one hand clapping?”*  

The crowd roars. Time fractures.  

You laugh.  

You clap your hands once, and the sound blooms into a thunderclap, a shockwave that shatters the monolith into a flock of paper cranes. They spiral upward, each wing inscribed with a theorem, a poem, a memory. The arena erupts in silence—stunned, sacred—before erupting into applause that shakes the dome.  

The judges, faceless in their golden masks, crown you with a wreath of fractal gold. Your rivals bow, their tech dimmed, their eyes wide with something like awe. The Martian boy smiles, his drones swirling into a single glowing star that hovers above your palm.  

You wake up clutching your pen, the taste of static and stardust on your tongue. Somewhere, in the liminal space between sleep and waking, the labyrinth still breathes—and you, improbably, are its master.
