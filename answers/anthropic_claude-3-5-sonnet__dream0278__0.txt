I am dreaming. I find myself perched on the edge of an iridescent crystal platform floating impossibly high in a twilight sky streaked with ribbons of aurora in impossible colors. The air shimmers with dancing motes of starlight that whisper ancient secrets as they swirl around me. Below, through gaps in the luminous clouds, I can see the glinting spires of a city that seems to be made entirely of light and shadow, its architecture defying all known laws of physics.

Before me hovers a shimmering doorway of pure energy, its surface rippling like liquid mercury. Through its translucent veil, I catch tantalizing glimpses of wondrous things - gardens where flowers bloom with memories instead of petals, libraries where books read themselves, and fountains that flow with liquid time.

The starlight motes swirl more urgently now, their whispers growing insistent. My toes curl over the crystal edge as I lean forward slightly, feeling the portal's energy crackling against my skin like static electricity...
