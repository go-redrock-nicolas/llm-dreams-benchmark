I am dreaming. The salt-laden air burns my nostrils as I regain consciousness, my body splayed across coarse sand that sparkles like crushed diamonds in the merciless tropical sun. The wreckage of the ship lies scattered across the shoreline like the skeleton of some ancient leviathan, twisted metal and splintered wood creating grotesque sculptures against the azure horizon.

As I stumble to my feet, my waterlogged clothes heavy and chafing, I notice how the palm trees seem to whisper secrets to each other, their fronds dancing in patterns that feel almost intentional. My salvaged supplies – a half-empty water bottle, a weathered lighter, and a torn backpack – seem pitiful against the vastness of this untamed paradise.

The days begin to blur together like watercolors in the rain. The sun rises and sets in spectacular displays that mock my solitude, painting the sky in impossible shades of amber and violet. At night, the stars seem close enough to touch, forming constellations I've never seen before, as if even the heavens are different in this forsaken place.

My dreams within this dream become increasingly vivid – I see rescue ships made of moonlight that dissolve when I reach for them, and hear phantom helicopter blades that turn out to be the rhythmic crushing of waves against the shore. The island itself seems to be alive, breathing beneath my feet, its jungle heart beating in sync with my own desperate pulse.

As my supplies dwindle to almost nothing, I begin to notice strange things: coconuts that glow with an inner light at dusk, fish that leap from the water in perfect geometric patterns, and birds that hover motionless in the sky like glitches in reality. Am I hallucinating from dehydration, or is this island something more than it appears? The line between survival and madness grows thinner with each passing sunset...

The dream begins to take on a surreal quality as the island seems to shift and change when I'm not looking directly at it. Beaches appear where there were cliffs yesterday, and the jungle paths lead to different destinations each time I walk them. I'm no longer certain if I'm trying to survive on the island, or if the island is trying to survive within me...
