I am dreaming. You wake up to discover the rules of society have completely changed overnight. What was once normal is now forbidden, and you must navigate this new world carefully. The streets are eerily quiet, with signs posted everywhere warning you not to repeat the old ways. You notice people whispering in hushed tones, their eyes darting around suspiciously, unsure of who might report them for a tiny infraction.

You make your way down the sunlit street, trying to orient yourself in this unfamiliar world. The houses look the same, but you can tell that something is different. The air feels thick with tension, like the calm before a storm. You pass by what was once a bustling supermarket, now boarded up and marked with graffiti that reads, “New Beginnings.”

You come across a small group of people huddled together in a park, their voices barely audible. You hesitantly approach, feeling like an outsider in your own life. They glance at you warily, and one of them motions for you to sit. “We’re not sure if we can trust anyone anymore,” says the eldest-looking member of the group, a kindly-looking woman with a soft voice and a gentle smile.

As you listen to their quiet chatter, you realize they are forming a new community based on trust and mutual support. The old rules of society have been replaced by a set of unwritten laws that everyone seems to know instinctively. You wonder if these changes are for the better or if they're simply another form of control.

After a few minutes of cautious conversation, you decide to part ways. The group presses a small, cold metal object into your hand as you leave, and you look down to see a metal disk with a pattern of slanted lines etched onto its surface. “It’s part of the New Laws,” the woman murmurs. “You’ll understand soon.”

With a cautious nod, you walk away, the object cold and unfamiliar in your hand. You wonder what the New Laws mean, and how they will affect your life. You feel a sense of both intrigue and apprehension, knowing that the world you once knew has now been turned upside down.
