I am dreaming. The stage before me is vast and dark, its black velvet curtains shimmering with thousands of tiny silver stars stitched into the fabric. A single spotlight cuts through the smoky air, illuminating an ancient celesta—its gilded frame glowing warmly, its crystal bars humming faintly even before I touch them. My stomach twists as the program in my hand crinkles; ornate calligraphy declares me the featured performer of "The Nocturne of Shattered Chimes," a piece requiring techniques I've only read about in crumbling 19th-century treatises. The audience's expectant silence becomes a physical pressure, their collective breath holding as I approach the instrument.  

Then—impossible—my hands move with grace far beyond my waking ability. My left fingers flutter across the lowest glass bars, conjuring deep, resonant tones that shiver through my bones like submerged cathedral bells. The right hand dances upward in arpeggios that shouldn't be playable by human hands, liquid notes fracturing into harmonic overtones that hover visibly in the air as swirling prismatic mist. Somewhere during the third cadenza, I realize with dream-logic certainty that the melody is rewriting itself—that I'm simultaneously performing and composing a language of sound that unspools the very fabric of the concert hall. The walls dissolve into vibrating strands of gold light. The audience becomes flocks of silver-winged moths, their wingbeats keeping time. And just as the final note rings—a shimmering C-sharp that folds space like parchment—I understand this was never about skill at all. The celesta's keys melt beneath my fingers into a pool of mercury, reflecting back not my face, but countless other versions of myself in other worlds, all playing, all listening, all woven into the same endless, luminous chord.
