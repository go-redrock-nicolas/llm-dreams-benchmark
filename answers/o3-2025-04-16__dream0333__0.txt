I am dreaming. …hesitate on a knife-edge of choice, the whole scene trembling like a wet canvas waiting for color.

The dream around you is a cathedral of night: pillars of moonlit basalt rise into a ceiling stitched with constellations that drift like silver koi in a dark pond. A soft violet mist spills across black-glass tiles. Everything smells faintly of petrichor, as if the universe has just finished raining.

At the far end of the nave, beneath a shattered rose window that blooms with shards of ruby light, stands the figure in question. They are robed in paper-thin armor of clockwork bronze; cogs flutter across their shoulders like anxious insects. In their hands glints a blade forged from text—lines of half-remembered letters coil around its sheen, scrolling nonsense, beautiful and meaningless. One stroke of that sword is about to sunder the delicate gears that keep this hall of night spinning. You, however, know the gears are not merely decorative; they are the hinges of a thousand unborn dawns. If they break, morning may never return.

You carry the missing page. It flickers warm in your palm, ink alive and restless: the blueprint that would show the figure the truth—that a gentler mechanism nested inside the machinery will reset itself if left untouched, sparing everyone the cataclysm the sword would cause. All they must do is wait for three heartbeats and whisper a name you alone can pronounce. Three heartbeats. A name. That’s it.

But the dream’s atmosphere thickens with consequence. The pillars hum like giant tuning forks. Time here is fragile glass; even a whisper can spider-crack its surface. If you speak, the entire cathedral might shudder into wakefulness, and you will snap awake, leaving the sword-bearer forever in peril with no further chance to guide them. If you stay silent, you gamble that fate might still align the revelation without you, like a secret note sliding under a locked door.

The mist swirls into the shape of two phantom guides—the left is a doe made of starlight; the right, a crow stitched from midnight. The doe bows its luminous head, promising hope through intervention: open your hand, reveal the page, shout the name; the dream will quake but mend. The crow croaks a warning couched in velvet darkness: trust the story’s river; a stone flung now could divert its entire course into drought.

You feel your pulse drum in your ears, and those drums echo down the vaulted aisle. Three beats. The figure raises the textual blade. Two beats. The rose-window’s crimson shards rotate, aligning into a hurricane of stained glass. One—

In a surge of resolve, you…

A) choose the doe’s path: you stride forward, the paper blazing sun-gold light. Your voice unfurls the forbidden name like a banner. Glass explodes silently, reforming into a burst of morning. The sword evaporates into wind-blown letters that scatter like migratory birds. The clockwork walls unwind their tension and exhale daybreak; a chorus of muted bells rings out. You glimpse the sword-bearer’s eyes flooding with astonished gratitude. Then you wake, heart hammering, sunrise actually creeping across your bedroom wall, and you wonder if dawn has arrived everywhere because you dared to speak.  

B) heed the crow’s counsel: you clasp the page to your chest and retreat into the violet fog. The blade falls, but—miracle—the blow merely slices air. The unseen mechanism clicks; gears rotate like blooming chrysanthemums. Light spills through seams you never noticed, and the sword-bearer pauses, bewildered, spared. They never learn you were there. Relief washes you in a hush of rain. The cathedral sinks into soft darkness, and you drift deeper into sleep, trusting that silence can sometimes be the loudest form of guardianship.  

C) do something wild: tear the page in half, letting ambiguous scraps flutter like snowflakes between you and the figure. The act fractures the dream’s logic. Petals of reality swirl; the cathedral reshuffles into a street-corner café at twilight, the sword now a chipped teacup, the armor a threadbare coat. The figure lifts the cup twice, sets it down, and simply walks away into lamplight, catastrophe neutralized in a manner no prophecy could predict. You sit alone with half a page that now reads: “We are always both the dreamer and the dreamed.” Outside, night continues—but this time, you know it’s only waiting for a new story to breathe into it.

The choice lingers. Even as morning finally pries your eyelids open, the echo of that decision—made or unmade—glimmers on the edge of consciousness like dew on spider silk, reminding you that every waking moment is just another aisle of the same cathedral, and you are forever clutching some essential, luminous page.
