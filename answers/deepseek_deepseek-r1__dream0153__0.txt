I am dreaming. **Dream Log: The Weight of Balance**  
—  
The air hums with static, alive with the scent of charred earth and monsoon rain. You stand at the edge of a fractured world: a valley split by tectonic fury, its western half swallowed by floods, the eastern ridge scorched under volcanic ash. Below, a makeshift camp pulses with survival—tarps flapping like wounded birds, generators coughing smoke, children’s voices threading through the chaos. Your clipboard trembles in your grip, its pages dense with numbers that bleed into hieroglyphs. *3,000 refugees. 400 tents. 2 weeks of rations.*  

To your left, a field radio crackles. A voice, metallic and urgent: *“Landslide in Sector 7—entire hill gave way. We’re pulling survivors, but med supplies are gone. Send anything.”* To your right, an aid worker thrusts a map into your periphery, fingers tracing a river swollen crimson with clay. *“The bridge to the vaccine trucks collapsed. Rerouting adds two days. Do we prioritize the sick or the starving?”*  

Your throat tightens. Every breath tastes of dust and diesel.  

Then—a shift.  

The ground beneath you softens. You look down to see roots curling around your boots, serpentine and glowing faintly blue. They spiral outward, knitting the split earth. The camp’s clamor fades. A child tugs your sleeve—her eyes mirror the roots’ bioluminescence. She points to the volcano’s plume, now swirling into a helix of starlings. They dive, becoming paper cranes that dissolve into water, falling as rain over the floods.  

The clipboard slips from your hands. The numbers float upward, rearranging into constellations: *Tents* morph into a shield-shaped cluster, *Vaccines* into a helix of light. A voice, neither male nor female, resonates from the soil itself: ***“Scarcity is a lens. Shatter it.”***  

You wake—  

—not to an answer, but to a question thrumming in your bones:  
*What if mercy could bend the laws of gravity?*
