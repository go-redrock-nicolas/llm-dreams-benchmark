I am dreaming. You press your forehead against the cool metal window frame, heart pounding like a tribal drum, as the last flicker of light dies and the tunnel dissolves into a suffocating void. All around you, muted scrapes of panic rise as one passenger scrabbles for the emergency handle—nothing. The air takes on a metallic tang of fear and static, sticky on your tongue. You sense the train has tilted, nose-down, as if gravity itself has decided to play a trick. A distant rumble shivers through the seats, so low you feel it in your bones.

A single, phosphorescent mote appears, hovering in mid-air, like a firefly born from your own racing pulse. Then dozens of them drift through the car, weaving around outstretched hands. In their glow you see passengers’ features soften—eyes widening, jaws slackening—as though these tiny lights are whispering secrets behind their teeth. The darkness around them retreats, revealing walls slick with a living moss that pulses with emerald veins. You reach out and your fingers sink into its cool, trembling texture; for a moment you imagine the whole world quivering under your touch.

Suddenly the train groans and lurches forward, not on iron tracks but gliding on a glassy black river that seems to flow beneath the seats. Water splashes against the doors in errant sprays, each droplet a tiny prism that fractures the phosphorescent bloom overhead into rainbow shards. The car begins to sway like a boat, and the faces of your fellow travelers—once tense and anxious—relax into childlike wonder. Someone murmurs, “It’s beautiful,” voice echoing oddly, as if ten people spoke in unison.

You rise and step through the aisle; every footstep echoes, though nothing seems solid. Instead of seats, gentle ripples shift under your weight. The train widens and becomes a grand corridor opening into a cavern of luminous stalactites, dripping liquid light that pools at your feet. You hear music—soft strings weaving through the hush, beckoning you deeper. Somewhere behind you, a child’s laughter rings clear and true, and you realize it’s your own.

Compelled, you walk toward a distant archway formed by two converging beams of light. Each step fills you with curious calm, as though the fear has slipped from your skin and fallen away like old scales. Beyond the arch, an endless sky of opalescent clouds drifts past, each cloud inscribed with memories—fragments of childhood summers, whispered secrets, half-forgotten dreams. You raise a hand to trace one cloud’s edge; it parts in a ripple of violet mist and you glimpse a single perfect moment: you, laughing in golden sunlight, free of worry, untethered.

A breath of wind—warm, resonant, like a mother’s lullaby—stirs around you. The train’s gentle hum fades behind that hush, and you know you must step through. With one last glance at the cavern’s glowing walls, you pass under the archway. The violet mist envelopes you, and all at once you awaken on the subway seat: fluorescent lights flicker back to life, the train shudders, and passengers straighten up, blinking as though waking from a shared reverie. Your heart still thrums in your chest, and in your hand rests a single phosphorescent mote—a soft, pulsing glow that vanishes the moment you squeeze it. You’re alone again, but you carry the echo of that luminous dream in every breath.
