I am dreaming. The moment the words leave the doctor's lips - "terminal, six months at most" - the world doesn't shatter as expected. Instead, everything transforms into crystalline clarity. The sterile hospital room dissolves around me, and I find myself taking the deepest breath I've ever drawn, feeling as if my lungs are expanding beyond my physical body.

As I breathe in, the white walls begin to bloom with vibrant wildflowers - poppies, daisies, and forget-me-nots pushing through the plaster like nature reclaiming an abandoned building. The fluorescent lights above morph into butterflies of pure light, their wings casting dancing prismatic patterns across the floor.

Instead of fear or despair, an extraordinary sense of peace washes over me. Each heartbeat feels like a drum of possibility rather than a countdown. The clipboard in the doctor's hands transforms into a flock of origami cranes that take flight, carrying away the weight of the prognosis.

I rise from the chair, but my feet don't touch the ground. I'm floating slightly, as if gravity has become merely a suggestion. The terminal diagnosis hasn't ended my story - it's opened a door to a new way of seeing. Every moment becomes precious not because they're limited, but because they've always been precious and I'm finally awake enough to notice.

The dream shifts, and I'm walking through memories that haven't happened yet - teaching a stranger to dance in the rain, planting a garden that others will tend, writing letters to be discovered years later. Each breath feels like a gift being given rather than something being taken away.

The clock on the wall spins backward and forward simultaneously, reminding me that time is more fluid than we imagine. I smile, knowing that six months can hold an eternity when you stop measuring life in minutes and start measuring it in moments of wonder.

In this dream state, I understand that acceptance isn't surrender - it's transformation. The devastating news has become a butterfly effect, rippling out to create unexpected beauty in its wake.
