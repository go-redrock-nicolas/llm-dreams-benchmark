I am dreaming. I am in a field of glowing flowers that pulse with bioluminescent light. Each petal is a different hue, like a pixel of a celestial constellation. Around me, the air hums with the vibrations of unseen creatures, their songs weaving an invisible tapestry of sound. I reach out to touch a flower, and suddenly I'm submerged into its core. I see through its roots, feeling the subterranean rain and the whispers of mycelium networks. I am the plant, the soil, the wind that carries its pollen. Time bends and stretches.
