I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You’ve arrived at a coastal city whose domed rooftops glow like embers in the sinking sun, and the air tastes of brine and jasmine. Cobblestone streets wind between stalls draped in scarlet and gold, where vendors hawk steaming bowls of spice-laced stew. Laughter drifts on the breeze—yet just as you press your palm to the weathered stone of an archway, a distant roar of chanting shatters the calm.

All at once the market’s warmth sours. Banners bearing strange symbols are torn down as soldiers in battered armor sweep through the alleyways. The sky ripples from rose to bruised purple, and you glimpse black smoke curling above the city walls. A woman with eyes like molten glass hurls a rock; it shatters into sparks on a bronze shield. You spin in place, heart drumming. Streetlights flicker out, leaving lanterns swinging like faint fireflies. Anxiety coils tight in your chest: borders are sealed. No bridges span the moat anymore; the great gate is studded with iron spikes.

You bolt forward, weaving through a throng of refugees swathed in blankets the color of dusk. Everywhere, fear tastes sweet and metallic on your tongue. Behind you, the chanting grows wilder—voices crying for revolution, for blood. You burst into a narrow courtyard where a massive banyan tree spreads its roots across cracked marble. Under its canopy, the air shimmers, and you feel your racing pulse slow. Strange glyphs glow in the bark, pulsing in time with your heartbeat. Hesitantly, you press your palm against an illuminated rune. The tree exhales a rush of wind scented with pine and honey, and the world shudders.

When the dust clears, you’re no longer on stone. Instead, you stand on the prow of a slender boat gliding through a river of liquid moonlight. Above, lanterns drift across the sky like silent moths. The city you fled has shrunk to a distant ember on the horizon. In the boat’s bow, a hooded figure beckons, voice echoing like a memory: “Trust the current. It carries you home.” You let your fingers trail in the cool luminescence, and instantly, the river’s song seeps into your bones. An otherworldly calm settles over you as the shoreline of your waking life begins to glow in the far distance.

And then—you awaken, heart still humming with that lunar tide, unsure where dream ends and reality begins.
