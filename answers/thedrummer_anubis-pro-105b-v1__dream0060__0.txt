I am dreaming. I'm standing at the edge of a cliff, the cool breeze  caressing the hairs on my neck as I gaze out at the sprawling landscape before me, a breathtaking cathedral of rock and sky spreading out as far as the eye can see. I feel the chill of the stone wall pressed against my back as I think about the journey that brought me here.

Ever since childhood, I have dreamed of triumphing at the Tallaweed gamesâ€”a legendary celebration of skill, grace and strength that only the most accomplished and determined competitors dare to enter. I vividly remember poring over dusty old council books, gleaning any hints and insights that might aid my training. I spent countless hours honing my skills, testing the limits of body and mind as I strove to sculpt myself into a worthy competitor.

And now, at last, my chance has finally arrived. I'm here at the entrance to the games, my mind awhirl of nervous anticipation and confident determination. I know that success is within reach.
