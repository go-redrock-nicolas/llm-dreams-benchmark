I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You stand at the center of a vast hall whose walls are made of living glass, flickering with words in seven tongues—Arabic calligraphy curling like desert winds, Chinese characters dissolving into dragon-scale geometry, the rhythmic clap of Swahili syllables, the lush roll of Brazilian Portuguese, the stern runs of Russian consonants, the warm chant of Hindi, and the deep, earth-bound pulses of Navajo. At your feet, a mosaic of shifting maps unspools: from the dunes of the Rub’ al Khali to the terraced rice paddies along the Li River, across the savannah of the Serengeti to the rain-heavy canopies of the Amazon, winding through onion-domed spires of Moscow, past saffron-prayered shrines of Varanasi, and into the sculpted buttes of the American Southwest.

Your mind spins as each language vies for attention. You feel the silky threads of Mandarin slip through your fingers while the swirl of Hindi keystrokes tugs at your temples. You try to speak them all at once, and suddenly you’re seated at a grand round table hewn from ancient cedar. Seven ambassadors—each clothed in the colors and symbols of a different land—press expectant faces toward you. Their voices overlay in a single, rising chord: a plea for peace, a demand for alliance, a vow of mutual respect. You open your mouth to reply and seven tongues roll out like seven flags in the wind, each perfectly pitched.

But the hall is not stable. The floor tiles rearrange themselves beneath you, slaloming into new patterns. Lanterns drift overhead, each glowing with a different hue: amber, jade, indigo, ruby, sapphire, gold, and onyx. As you step forward, the languages shift shape—Arabic blossoms into a desert rose whose petals open to reveal neon-etched numerals; Swahili becomes a bronze spear that hums with ancestral power; Russian curls into frost-flower fractals along the walls. You realize: these aren’t just words. They are living artifacts of culture and memory.

A hush falls. You raise a hand and the seven artifacts converge, spinning into a single crystalline globe. Inside it, you see scenes from your mission: you walking through border checkpoints handing out truce treaties, children giggling as they learn each other’s greetings, elders shaking hands beneath a banner woven from every nation’s flag. You feel the weight of exhaustion melt away into awe. In that moment, your brain stops its frantic juggling act. The languages merge—no longer seven, but one grand symphony of human sound. It resonates through your chest like a heartbeat.

And then you awaken, heart still echoing that unified rhythm. Tucked under your tongue are seven perfect words—each a promise, each a greeting, each a beginning: Salaam, N ho, Jambo, Olá, Privet, Namaste, Yá’át’ééh. You smile, knowing that somewhere in the space between dream and dawn, you have forged a language of peace.
