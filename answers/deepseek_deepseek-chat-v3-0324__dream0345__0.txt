I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and distant lightning, the kind that lingers just before a storm breaks. The sky is a bruised purple, streaked with veins of gold where the sun struggles to pierce the clouds. I am standing in a field of silver grass that whispers secrets as it sways, each blade humming a tune just beyond comprehension.  

And then I see them—my friend, but not as I know them. Their movements are jagged, puppet-like, as if unseen strings tug at their limbs. Their eyes, usually warm and familiar, are hollow, reflecting a sky that isn’t there. They are building something—no, unraveling something—their fingers working feverishly at the seams of reality itself. The ground beneath them pulses like a living thing, breathing in time with their erratic rhythm.  

I call their name, but the wind steals my voice. When I reach out, the space between us stretches, warping like heat haze. Their head snaps toward me, too quick, too sharp, and for a heartbeat, I see something else staring back through their face—something vast and hungry.  

Do I step forward, into the distortion, and risk being swallowed by whatever has taken hold of them? Or do I retreat, leaving them to whatever unseen force now guides their hands? The grass around me begins to wither, curling into blackened threads. The choice is mine, but the dream is already shifting, the edges of the world fraying like old cloth.  

And then—just before I wake—I hear my friend laugh, a sound like breaking glass, and the sky cracks open.
