I am dreaming. I open my eyes and find myself floating, untethered, within an infinite twilight. There is no up, no down—no fixed orientation at all—and yet, as I look around, I comprehend that I am inside a vast cathedral of floating light-blooms, organic orbs pulsing with bioluminescent emotion. The air—if it can be called that—is thick and syrupy, not air at all, but something like liquid thought, something resonant with the scent of forgotten memories and the taste of time bending.

I try to move, but my limbs refuse my usual directives. I realize that this reality does not obey the laws of motion I know. Here, *intention* is the only way forward—an amalgam of will and emotion that colors the landscape in beside-itself geometries. I reach deep into my chest and conjure a single pure note, not sung, but imagined—golden and sweet—and a ripple radiates outward from my body. Instantly, I am propelled forward, swimming in concentric waves of color that sing as I pass.

With every intention-formed motion, the world reacts. That which seems solid—a coral spire of crystal thought—is only moored in place by the general agreement of the local sentients. I meet a thinking rivulet of awareness, and in greeting, it laces itself around my limbs like a vine made from whispers.

Here, gravity isn't a pull—it's a *persuasion* that ebbs and flows depending upon the emotional charge of those present. When I feel joy, I soar upward on gossamer gales of wonder. In moments of doubt or fear, I sink into shimmering pools of dream-silt, bubbling up again only when my resolve hardens into form.

The sky—as near as there is one—moves too. Shadows and light interlace in psychic helixes; constellations whisper their origins aloud, and former stars, long collapsed and erased from my home universe, manifest as living specters—pulsing with grief and offering their final breath as philosophical gifts.

I meet beings woven from color and contradiction—some humanoid, others vast and fluid, layers upon layers of minds existing in varies stages of evolution and nostalgia. They do not speak with mouths, but with bursts of sensing; they teach me to listen with my bones and to see with my fingertips. My hair melts into a train of stardust threads, a living compass to the laws of this redundant-reverse-space.

Everything follows the rhythms of time splintered yet whole. In a single heartbeat, I experience moments from five lifetimes that could have been, folding and unfolding like origami dreams.

I walk upon a stair that is also a sleeping beast, its dreaming breath pushing me forward if I tread gently. If I run, it sighs and drifts to another realm, vanishing with even the hint of fear.

Here, *truth is mutable,* and paradox is *pleased*. I breathe not oxygen, not even air—no, but *exhilaration,* and the greater my clarity, the more solid my existence. And when I stumble, something unexpected happens: the dreamscape mourns along with me, until I recover by choosing beauty over correctness.

And in the very center of this strange dimension, beneath the seven rotating moons of the Forgotten Choir, I find a tree. It is a tree that always was, never grew, and will never die. It is made entirely of *questions never answered*, and when I eat its fruit, I wake—but now I know, with bone-deep knowing—I can always return.

This dream isn’t over. I carry a key stitched from velvet lightning somewhere beneath my fourth rib. One day, I will dream again, and answer its call.
