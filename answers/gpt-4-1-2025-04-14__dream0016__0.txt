I am dreaming. I feel the anxious flutter of waiting as the echoing airport announcements blur with the hum of fluorescent lights overhead. The terminal is a dizzying river of passengers, suitcases trundling and voices merging into an unintelligible babble. I glance at the great, glowing board: DELAYED. My precious connecting flight—my bridge to the conference that feels like the pivot of my whole year—shimmers just out of grasp. 

Time becomes syrup in this place. My palms tingle, my mind racing through every missed opportunity, every handshake not made. I start to pace, dodging carry-ons and clusters of weary travelers. Through tall windows, the planes outside sit like silver sleeping beasts, wings stretching into a bruised, cloud-scraped sky. It begins to rain, drops stalking across the glass, bending the lights into trembling ribbons. 

Suddenly, a peculiar sensation—like a gentle tug at the nape of my neck—guides my attention to a narrow hallway plastered in unfamiliar signs and impossible languages. I hesitate, curiosity layered over anxiety, and as I step forward, the fluorescent lights flicker and the world subtly shifts.

The airport corridor grows longer, ceilings arching higher like a cathedral. The floor tiles soften into mists that swirl beneath my feet. Each step echoes, not with the hollow sound of shoes on linoleum, but with distant music—fragile piano notes, half-remembered lullabies. Travelers pass me in slow motion: a woman cradling a bouquet of glowing origami cranes, a child whose backpack wriggles with blue butterflies. My anxiety is drawn thin, stretched out into possibility.

Suddenly, the walls of the terminal dissolve, revealing the next “gate” as a gossamer arch suspended over a garden of wild, carnation-bright flowers. The “agent” at the gate is a dream-figure—smiling, eyes reflecting galaxies. They hand me not a boarding pass, but a feather, iridescent and warm in my palm. 

I board a plane with wings spun of starlight, seats arranged in curling spirals. Other passengers are scholars, astronomers, poets, all murmuring excitedly about the “conference”—which now seems less like a panel discussion and more like a grand gathering of souls sharing secrets of the universe.

As the starlit plane ascends, I feel my worries slipping away, replaced by wonder. And I realize, in the vivid heart of the dream, that the delay was only ever an invitation … to let go, to explore, to awaken to the soaring mystery beneath my frantic plans.
