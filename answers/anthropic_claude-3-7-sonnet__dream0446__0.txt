I am dreaming. The paralysis begins as a slight heaviness in my fingertips, climbing through my arms like ivy on an abandoned building, until my entire body becomes weighted with impossible choices. I stand before two doors in a corridor that stretches endlessly in both directions, the walls breathing gently with a pearlescent sheen that changes color with each pulse—lavender to midnight blue to a gold so deep it hurts to look at directly.

The door on the left is weathered oak, warm and familiar, with a brass handle worn smooth by countless hands. The door on the right is sleek obsidian that reflects my face in distorted ripples, its handle a twisting piece of translucent crystal that seems to contain entire galaxies.

Such a simple choice—left or right—yet I've been standing here for what feels like years, my heart thundering against my ribs. Why can't I move? Why does this decision feel as though it might unravel the very fabric of who I am?

Time behaves strangely here. The shadows at my feet elongate and contract, sometimes pointing toward one door, sometimes the other. Occasionally they split in two, as if suggesting I could somehow choose both paths simultaneously.

From behind me comes the sound of something approaching—a rhythmic tapping like rainfall or fingernails on glass. I know I should turn to look, but my neck won't obey. Instead, I watch as my shadow begins to separate from my feet, rising up before me as a three-dimensional silhouette with eyes like distant stars.

"You've been here before," it whispers with my voice, but older, wiser. "You've chosen both doors a thousand times. You've chosen neither. The hesitation is the journey."

As it speaks, the corridor begins to fold inward like origami, the doors drawing closer together until they merge into a single archway. Beyond it lies not a room but an endless garden where books grow instead of flowers, their pages rustling in a wind I cannot feel.

I step forward, finally understanding that my paralysis wasn't indecision at all, but transformation.
