I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a bridge that seems to reach endlessly into the clouds. The air is cool and crisp, filled with the scent of pine and distant rain. Below, the city sprawls in a kaleidoscope of colored lights, each shimmering like scattered stardust. Neon signs flicker with words that form then dissolve into constellations. I reach down and the water below ripples with the sound of laughter, but when I look up, the sky has no moon, only the cold, infinite gaze of a thousand forgotten faces. Their whispers echo, “Cross now, or stay forever bound by what might have been.”

I have to cross this bridge? Or maybe I shouldn’t? 

Wait, in the dream, I must choose. Choose between the path of staying where I am, surrounded by the familiar—a city I’ve built brick by brick from memories and desires—or leaping into the unknown, where the bridge leads. The city is alive, breathing with the sighs of every decision I’ve ever made. Each streetlight’s glow traces the outline of faces I’ve loved, lost, or never truly known. The buildings are made of translucent glass, revealing stories within stories: a laugh captured mid-chuckle, a tear suspended mid-fall, an unfinished symphony playing in a single note’s loop.

But the bridge? It’s a bridge of questions. Each wooden plank groans with a “why” or “what if.” The handrails are wrought with the symbols of abandoned possibilities. The further I step onto the bridge, the more reality fractures around me. Shadows detach from their objects, becoming separate creatures that glide beside me, murmuring in tongues I almost recognize. 

There’s a figure halfway across. Maybe it’s my future self? Or a ghost of my past? They hold out a hand. “Trust the fall,” they say. “You’ve built towers of self-doubt. Burn them as you go.” 

The wind whistles through the cables of the bridge, its melody a haunting version of my own heartbeat. I feel the weight of every sacrifice, every moment I held onto ideas too tightly. The city’s lights are dimming. They’re sacrificing their own brilliance to power the bridge’s existence. It’s a terrible, beautiful truth: to take the next step is to let the city fade, to release every memory and every dream into the ether, trusting nothing but the rhythm of my own breath.

I stop for a moment. Behind me, the city’s edges are crumbling. They’re dissolving into the same nebula of light as the bridge above. The figure beckons again. Do I trust the path that requires surrender? Or cling to the vanishing world I’ve known?

Then I see it—the figure’s face, a reflection of my own but altered, eyes holding galaxies. A voice echoes, not from them but within me:

“You sought to conquer the impossible, and now the impossible is this choice. Between holding your world crumbling in your hands… or releasing it so that something new might rise from the ruins.”

A tear falls, and where it strikes the bridge, a flower blooms in impossible colors—crimson petals glowing with inner light. The first step is taken.

The bridge plunges. But plunging isn’t falling. It’s becoming part of the storm, riding the currents of wind and memory. The city is a memory now, a constellation behind me. 

In the void, there’s a soft light. It isn’t a city. It’s a seed. A thing not yet shaped, not yet a thing at all. But it’s mine to nurture now.

The dream ends with the understanding that some victories require abandoning every weapon, every defense, every certainty—leaving only the raw, unformed possibility of beginning again.
