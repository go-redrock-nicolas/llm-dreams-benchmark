I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a city of mirrors, each building a shifting mosaic of glass that reflects not just the physical world, but the raw, unfiltered truths of those who pass by. The air hums with whispers—fragments of self-loathing, pride, and secrets clawing to escape the mouths of the sleepless. You walk barefoot on streets paved with shattered reflections, each shard glinting with the faces of strangers… and yourself.  

You notice a woman ahead, her voice sharp as broken glass as she berates a street vendor for his slowness. Her impatience is a blade, slicing through his stammered apologies. You feel a surge of disdain—for her cruelty, her lack of grace. But as you pass her, your reflection in a nearby mirror stutters. Suddenly, *you* are the one shouting, your own face twisted in the same sneer, a memory unspooling: a time you lashed out at someone for a trivial delay, your own impatience a mask for fear. The mirror cracks where your reflection’s heart would be.  

The city shifts. You stumble into a garden where the trees grow eyes instead of leaves, blinking slowly, judging. A man kneels beneath one, plucking the eyes like fruit and tossing them into a river that flows backward. “He’s wasting time,” you mutter, irritation rising. “He should be *doing* something.” But as you step closer, the river’s current pulls at your ankles, dragging you into visions: yourself scrolling endlessly through screens, avoiding tasks, letting hours rot like overripe fruit. The man’s face turns to yours, his hands stained with the juice of wasted moments. The garden withers.  

A shadowy figure materializes, its form fluid—a child, then an elder, then a faceless silhouette cloaked in moth-winged velvet. It speaks without moving its lips, the words vibrating in your bones: *“You see yourself in everyone you judge. Their flaws are the lanterns lighting your own shadows. Why do you hate the mirror?”*  

You whirl, and the city collapses into a single, towering mirror. Your reflection stares back, but its eyes are wrong—*wrong* in a way that makes your stomach churn. It mimics your movements, but with a smirk, a tilt of the head, a flick of the wrist that feels too familiar. It’s not you. It’s *you*, but sharpened, grotesque, the version you fear most. The one who lies to survive. The one who betrays kindness for control. The one who hides vulnerability behind scorn.  

You reach out to shatter the glass, but your hand passes through it. The mirror swallows you.  

Now you’re in a cavern of echoes, walls lined with teeth-like stalactites that chatter with every breath you take. A thousand versions of yourself pace the room, each embodying a trait you’ve condemned in others: the liar, the coward, the jealous one, the fraud. They point at one another, screaming accusations, but their voices merge into a single, guttural chant: *“You. You. You.”*  

The shadow figure reappears, holding a blade forged from starlight. “Cut the thread,” it says, pressing the hilt into your palm. “Or let it cut you.”  

You hesitate, then slash the air. The cavern dissolves.  

You wake in a field of dandelions, their seeds drifting like tiny ghosts. The ground beneath you is soft, fertile, alive with the pulse of growth. Where the mirrors once stood, there is only this: a horizon unbroken by judgment, a sky that holds no verdict. You kneel, pluck a dandelion, and blow. The seeds scatter—not as escape, but as offering.  

The dream fades, but the lesson lingers: the traits you despise in others are not foreign invaders. They are the uninvited guests at your own table, the parts of you starved of compassion. To hate them is to hate the soil that grows your roots. To tend them is to bloom.
