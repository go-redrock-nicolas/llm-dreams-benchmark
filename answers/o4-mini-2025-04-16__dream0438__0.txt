I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You wander through a vast hall whose walls shimmer like liquid moonlight. Tall windows of stained glass arc overhead, each pane alive with swirling nebulae in cobalt, rose, and gold. A soft hum pulses beneath your feet, like a heartbeat echoing in a cavern of stars. In the center of the hall stands an enormous blank canvas, five times your height, its surface glimmering with dew. Beside it, a single paintbrush floats on a cushion of mist.  

At first, you approach this scene as any ambitious artist would—eager to make your mark, to prove your skill, to seize the applause you once craved. You tiptoe forward, dip the brush into a pool of liquid amethyst, and press it to the canvas. The paint blooms like a flower: petals of violet spinning into waves of lavender. With each stroke, however, the canvas trembles, and you feel a stirring deep inside your chest—an old ache you thought long buried.  

Undeterred by the tremor, you paint a winding river of emerald and jade. As the green currents flow across the white expanse, the ache loosens, uncoiling like a tether being released. You pause to inhale. The air tastes of fresh rain on warm earth. A tinkling chorus of silver bells drifts down from the stained-glass heavens above.  

Painting becomes less about creation and more about surrender. When you sketch a cluster of sapphire blossoms, each petal unfolds a memory: a forgotten laugh, a childhood bedtime lullaby, a tear you once swallowed. The blossoms lift off the canvas and scatter into the air, dissolving into soft motes of light that rain down on your shoulders. With every glowing mote, you feel a centuries-old sorrow slip free, evaporating like morning mist.  

Embracing this therapeutic discovery, you let yourself dance before the canvas. Your brush arcs through the air, leaving trails of rose-gold that shimmer like spun sugar. Your movements grow more fluid, more playful—sometimes fast, sometimes slow—like falling into a warm current. Every swirl you paint stitches a gentle warmth into the hollow places of your heart. Colors once timid now blaze in joyous abandon, and the hall itself seems to applaud, its hum swelling into a triumphant chorus.  

At the very end of your dance, you stand before the canvas and gaze at your work: a riot of living color that pulses with your laughter, your tears, your breath. You realize the activity you began for praise has become something far greater—a portal to your own healing. The paintbrush drifts from your hand as the canvas gently dissolves into a field of dancing fireflies. One by one, the fireflies alight on your skin, each a bead of newfound peace.  

You close your eyes, cradling their glow against your heart, and in that luminous silence, you feel yourself coming home. Then, in a single exhale, the dream’s shimmering hall dissolves—and you awaken, carrying the warmth of that artistic healing back into your waking world.
