I am dreaming. The scene feels surreal, as I step onto a stage like I’m underwater—everything slows down, the spotlight a molten gold coin pinned to my chest.  The crowd below is made of my old teachers, all of them now ten years younger, their desks replaced by folding chairs.  Mr. Thompson, my high school English teacher, sits center front, wearing a paper flower behind one ear.  His mustache twitches as I open my mouth to speak—and out spills not words, but softly glowing origami cranes.  They ascend, each one fanning downward like a shower of embers, settling onto the crowd’s outstretched hands.  A murmur rises, like wind over wheat.  Now the floor beneath me is tilting, not left or right but *upward*, as if the theater is a giant elevator ascending into a starless sky.  The cranes above morph into constellations, their paper wings becoming stars that hum lullabies in a language I once knew.  My heartbeat syncs with the hum.  I reach for the edge of this rising world, but my fingers pass through the armrests of an airplane seat.  The last thing I remember is laughter—someone’s, or is it mine?—as the dream bends and folds itself into a crane, then vanishes like ash.
