I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I find myself standing in the heart of a bustling, neon-lit city that is not of our world. The buildings stretch into the heavens, their surfaces shifting like liquid silver, reflecting the kaleidoscope of lights blinking from every corner. The air is filled with a hum of activity, the symphony of life from countless alien creatures, their forms intriguing yet incomprehensible to my human perception.

Across from me, in the center of this otherworldly marketplace, stands my best friend since childhood, Alex. They're usually the calm in my storm, the logic to my emotion, but tonight, their eyes are ablaze with fierce determination, their usually neat bun of raven hair slightly unkempt, a sign of their internal turmoil mirroring my own.

"We can't just leave them, Leila!" Alex shouts over the cacophony of alien chatter and the sizzle of strange, ethereal food being cooked on carts around us. "They're suffering, and we have the power to help!"

I feel a surge of frustration, my hands gesturing expressive arcs in the cool, slightly gelid air. "But at what cost, Alex? We can't insert ourselves into another species' problems. We're not even sure they'll understand our help!"
