I am dreaming.

A soft, golden mist rises from an endless meadow, tall grasses shimmering like spun gold in dawn’s embrace. I wander barefoot, each step stirring whispers from the earth, none of which I can quite understand. Once, the trail leading to a twisting, sun-dappled forest would have thrilled me, promised secret worlds and adventure. Now, standing on its edge, I sense only the hollow echo of anticipation, like the aftertaste of sweetness lost.

A current of strange restlessness propels me forward—not into the forest, but into new lands that bloom from the shifting breeze. The sky—painted in unlikely shades of teal and amethyst—unfolds above, and the air hums with the gentle rub of invisible wings. In every tree, the bark sways gently to unheard music, the leaves flash memories of joys: dances, laughter, shared meals. I touch a tree, and my hand passes through, gathering a dust of luminous regrets and faded goals.

With each step, the world reframes itself: the meadow dissolves into a mirror-bright river, its banks bobbing with paper boats inked with unread poems and old hobbies. My reflection on the surface is restless, seeking new shapes—sometimes an artist, sometimes a wandering bard. I kneel and whisper to my reflection: *What now?* The water answers in ripples and song, “Creation flows where habit dries.”

I watch as stars begin falling, gently, like petals, lighting the path ahead. I follow, arms wide, into hills shaped from stories I’ve never told. I sculpt new meanings with my hands: a garden of possibilities, a chorus of small joys—learning to listen, savoring silence, offering warmth to strangers and songbirds alike. Fulfillment is no longer a prize to grasp, but a river to enter, flowing ever forward, shifting, changing, promising that in becoming lost, I might find something unexpected—something real.
