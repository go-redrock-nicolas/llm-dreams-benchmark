I am dreaming. I float through a cityscape of impossible architecture where buildings curve like waves frozen in glass and stone. The skies shift between deep indigo and burnished copper as twin moons—one emerald, one pearl—hang suspended in perpetual twilight. 

Walking along a spiral staircase that winds around the outside of a tower with no visible end, I notice my shadow splits into three distinct silhouettes, each moving independently. One reaches toward me, offering a key fashioned from what appears to be crystallized time—its edges shimmer with memories not yet lived.

The air tastes of salt and cinnamon, and distant chimes echo from bells no human hands have rung for centuries. I become aware that certain doorways throughout this realm appear repeatedly—a weathered blue door with a brass knocker shaped like a raven's head, a tiny red door that requires me to shrink to pass through, an archway overgrown with luminescent vines that whisper forgotten languages.

Rivers flow upward here, carrying boats filled with books whose pages turn themselves. Passengers read stories that seem strangely familiar—as though they're reading about my life, but with crucial differences that reveal paths not taken.

When I reach into my pocket, I find a compass whose needle points not north but toward what I most need to discover. Each time I follow it, I encounter mirrors that don't reflect my current self but show versions of me from different points in time, some looking back with knowing eyes, others with questions I've long forgotten how to ask.

The line between observer and observed blurs as I realize I am simultaneously dreaming this world and being dreamed by it—each thought manifesting as reality, each emotion painting the landscape with corresponding weather patterns and terrain.

The dream feels more authentic than waking life, as though I've finally returned to some essential truth long obscured by daylight's practical illusions.
