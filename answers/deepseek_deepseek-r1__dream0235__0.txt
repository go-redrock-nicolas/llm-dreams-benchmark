I am dreaming. The air here is thick with the scent of crushed petals and damp earth, an intoxicating haze that clings to your skin as you step into the grove. The **Daylight Enigma**, they call it—a sanctuary nested between the ribcage of jagged obsidian mountains and a sky striped with auroras that ripple like liquid mercury. You are nameless here, as all initiates are. Identities dissolve into motion. Your body is your voice now.  

Bodies glide around you, limbs carving arcs of meaning into the twilight. A figure with hair like tangled ivy spins in a helix, palms upturned—a **plea** sculpted in torque and tension. Another kneels, fingers splayed against the ground in a tremulous staccato, each vibration a confession of grief. The language here is fractal, recursive: a flick of the wrist can spiral into an epic of yearning, a bent knee can collapse into the silence between supernovas.  

You step forward, and the earth hums. Your left arm rises, not by choice but by instinct—an ancestral echo. Your fingertips graze a curtain of hanging moss, and it erupts into bioluminescent pollen, glittering like trapped stars. The community stills. A man with eyes like polished hematite mirrors your gesture, his torso curving in a counterbalance. His movements are a question mark.  

Your response blooms without thought: a slow arch of the spine, shoulders rolling like tides as your weight shifts to the balls of your feet—**vulnerability**, **readiness**, the paradox of holding both at once. The tribe exhales in unison, a sound like wind through a bone flute.  

Suddenly, the ground shudders. From the earth’s fissures surge ribbons of liquid light, kaleidoscopic and sentient. They coil around your ankles, your wrists, your throat, not to restrain but to *translate*. Your body becomes a conduit. Every suppressed sob, every stifled laugh trapped in your bones since childhood avalanches into motion—a hurricane of gestures. You reel backward in a delirium of release, carving shapes that taste like forgotten words: the corkscrew twist of your mother’s anger, the fluttering fingertips of your first love, the abortive lunges of every lie you’ve ever swallowed.  

When it ends, you’re on your knees. The tribe surrounds you, not touching but *resonating*. Their bodies hum at frequencies that stitch your fractures. The man with hematite eyes places a hand over his chest, then sweeps it outward in a parabola—**belonging**.  

Above, the auroras fracture into glyphs. You understand now: this is no dream.  
This is the syntax of your marrow.
