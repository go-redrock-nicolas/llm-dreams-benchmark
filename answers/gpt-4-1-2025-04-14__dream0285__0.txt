I am dreaming. …take a deep breath, feeling the electric prickle of anticipation skittering up my spine. The room around me—an impossibly long table stretching away into violet shadows—feels dense with charged silence, broken only by the low murmur of opinions converging like a slow, inevitable tide against the shore of my convictions. Faces blur a little at the edges, but the intensity in their eyes burns like twin moons: cold and clear.

My pulse throbs—a drumbeat in my ears—while the words I long to contribute swirl in my chest like a cyclone desperate to be let out. For a moment, I see myself from above: small, in the center of a storm of voices swirling colors and syllables through the air. The air itself seems to quiver, awash in hues of teal and gold.

I reach for my voice and find it not as a whisper but as a steady warmth, gathering at the center of my being. When I finally speak, my words emerge not as stuttering protest, but as shimmering ribbons, weaving through the air and sowing vibrant colors into the monochrome landscape. The room shifts; walls pulse with my courage, corners straighten, lights brighten, and shadows recede.

Eyes snap toward me—some doubtful, some startled, some unexpectedly gentle. My words, carefully conjured from the depths of belief and vulnerability, curl around the table, carving a new space in the conversation’s current—a brave disruption, a ripple braiding through the prevailing tide. 

My heartbeat steadies. The dream deepens, alive with possibility. In finding my voice, I watch as my courage shapes the dream’s world, and I realize: while disagreement set me apart, it is authenticity that bridges every distance.
