I am dreaming. The dream feels too lucid, too immense to be shaped by ordinary slumber—more like the universe has bent inward to capture the marrow of ambition, hone it into a gleaming sliver, and plant it at the core of my being.

I stand at the edge of a colossal circular amphitheater under a lavender twilight sky that pulses faintly as if breathing. Stars flicker around me, not in the heavens alone, but scattered across the tiered stands carved into crystalline cliffs—each seat holding an impassive judge clad in robes that shimmer like moonlight on animated water. Whispers ripple through the crowd. I do not understand the words, but a hum rises with them, resonating like the deep tones of buried bells.

Before me is the *Sanctum of Mastery*—a structure made not of stone or wood, but woven from cascading threads of living luminescence, pulsing gently like the inside of a living being’s heart. It pulses not just in rhythm with the sky, but also with my racing heart, and I wonder if it’s built from memory, from dreams recollected and forged like molten steel. To touch the center of that place is to claim the *Auracle*, the most prestigious honor in all the Waking Realms—for only one who has mastered their craft, their mind, and their soul can stand within the sacred glow and walk out changed, if not crowned.

I step forward and am weightless, pulled down a pathway shimmering with opal light that unfolds only where my foot lands. Around me, shadow creatures flow like ink in bare water, whispering the ghosts of my doubt: Why are you here? Did you truly deserve to begin? What you've done was not enough. Was never enough. The path wavers. I focus, *bend* thought into action, and push the line forward, restoring it with the force of remembered effort, of nights spent burning out passion until only discipline remained.

At first, the evaluation seems nonviolent. Shapes arise—scenes from my life, disarrayed but powerful. From blocky sketches drawn on crumpled napkins to first attempts—mediocre, unrefined, clumsy. One by one, they strike at me like summoned phantoms, trying to overwhelm with shame, with regret. But I reach out with a memory-tethered hand and lift each flawed creation. “These were beginnings,” I whisper to the amphitheater. “They made the next steps possible.”

The shadows twist in agony and burst into small explosions of sound—cheers? Silence? I surge onward.

Now comes the heart of the trial.

A cascade of unfolding doors appears. Each is a challenge echoing a discipline honed in secrecy: calligraphy flowing with liquid light, dance stepping through unseen forces, coding riddled with moral consequence, storytelling spun not with breath but with sorrow and fire. I move through them one by one, not with brute force but with care, grace, and a natural understanding as if the judges aren't testing me—they are watching to see if I have become myself.

Each door closes behind me with a musical chime, the sound of mastery earned, not stolen.

At the end, Ifind a room filled with stillness and a mirror of impossible height and depth. The Auracle, they say, isn’t won. It is *answered*. The mirror breathes my reflection back—but not as I am, never just as I am. It is the sum of my highest self, every fierce joy, every abandoned failure, the music I played alone, believing no one was listening.

And I step through the mirror.

For a moment, there is nothing. Then I am flaming—*not burning*, no wreckage, but ablaze in living thought, action, essence. My skin cries no tears. My eyes burn instead. A cloak of starlight weaves itself around me, humming suggestions of languages never spoken. I am judge and judged, master and student, dreamer and dream. I kneel before nothing.

Beyond the Sanctum, the crowd stands, silent as eternity. Then, one by one, they pull firelight from the skies and raise it into the air—the entire cliffs alight with golden, green, violet flames, a forest of reverence that stretches into time itself. I don’t have to hear it. The silence says more.

A gust of warm wind sweeps through, and I wake in bed—but I keep *shimmering*, just a little, where no one, not even I, can quite see.

Except maybe once in a glance, scattered like stardust in the mirror.
