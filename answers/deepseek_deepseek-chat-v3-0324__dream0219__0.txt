I am dreaming. **The Dream of Infinite Pages**  

I am dreaming.  

At first, the world is fuzzy at the edges—blurred like watercolor left out in the rain. Then, all at once, my mind *sharpens*. A switch flips deep within my consciousness, and I feel it: perfect recall. Photographic memory, unshakable and infinite. Every moment, every detail, every sensation is now etched into the unspooling scroll of my mind.  

I look around my childhood bedroom—except it isn’t *quite* a bedroom anymore. The walls are lined with bookshelves, but instead of spines, they are filled with *moments*. My first steps, preserved like a gilded folio. The scent of my grandmother’s perfume, crystallized into a delicate vial labeled *Honeysuckle, Summer 1998*. The feeling of rain on my face last April, folded neatly into a parchment envelope.  

I reach out, and a memory floats into my hands—the first time I rode a bike without training wheels. The image unfolds like a pop-up book: my father’s hands letting go, the wobble of wheels, the wind rushing past, laughter caught in my throat. The texture of the handlebars, cold and rubbery. The smell of cut grass. The scraped knee afterward. *Every* detail, pristine.  

Then I realize: I can pull *anything* now. Not just my own life—but *everything* I’ve ever seen, heard, or read. Equations bloom like constellations. Forgotten languages reassemble themselves on my tongue. The lyrics to every song, the lines of every poem, the brushstrokes of every painting I’ve glimpsed—all perfectly preserved.  

But then—the shelves *keep growing*.  

The room dissolves, and I am standing in a vast, endless library. The shelves spiral upward into an abyss of stars, each book a captured second, a thought, a breath. The air thrums with whispers—voices of people I’ve met, voices of characters from novels, voices of strangers whose faces I passed on the street.  

I hear a sound like paper wings. A flutter of pages surrounds me, each one a possibility—a memory I *could* have had. Alternate versions of myself move through the shelves, plucking different moments, living different lives.  

And then—terror.  

What if I can’t *stop* remembering? What if I open a book and drown in it? The pages are moving on their own now, flipping too fast, too loud, a hurricane of moments collapsing into me. My first heartbreak. Every awkward silence. Every failure. Every time I wasn’t enough. The library is *judging* me.  

I try to wake up—  

But the books won’t let me go.  

Then, just before the weight of infinity crushes me, I hear a whisper (or do I remember it?)—  

*"Forgetfulness is mercy too."*  

And like a candle snuffed, the library goes dark.  

—————  

I wake, gasping, clutching my sheets. My room is just my room again. The details fade. And for once, I don’t chase them.
