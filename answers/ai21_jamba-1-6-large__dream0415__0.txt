I am dreaming. Your dream landscape unfolds under a cerulean twilight. Vast rolling hills extend before you, each curve of the land draped in a tapestry of wildflowersâ€”violets, golds, and indigos swaying in a wind that whispers secrets of ancient times. Above, a kaleidoscope of stars clusters in constellations unknown to your waking eyes, pulsing faintly as if alive.
Let your instincts guide you through this dream, where the hills hold the whispers of dreams yet to be and the sky above harbors the echoes of those long forgotten. You may wander these meadows, climb toward the stars, or simply lie back and let the dream unfold its story to you.
What will you do?
