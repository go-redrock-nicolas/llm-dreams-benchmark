I am dreaming. I can feel it between my eyelids. My eyes are closed. My brain knows it's running the show. But then, I open my eyes. 

I am not awake. I'm in a dream, yes, but I can feel my heart racing. 

I'm racing to catch up with reality, and I think this is the dreamiest I've ever felt. I think I'm approaching the realest part of my sleep. 

I arrive outside a hospital. It's the kind of hospital you'd see in a movie. The kind of hospital that's huge and inviting. The outside is black and white, but it's vivid and alive. 

The inside of the hospital is dark. It's poorly lit, like the kind of poorly lit you see in a horror movie. The fluorescent lights shine harshly down on me, making my skin look green. 

The hallway stretches out in front of me infinitely. It's an endless corridor, lined with doors. The doors are all the same. They look like wood, but there's no wood. They're just empty panels. They're black. They're featureless. No handles. No locks. 

I try to turn back, but there's no way back. I'm stuck in the dream. No matter how much I try to wake up, I'm stuck. 

Suddenly, one of the doors swings open. A figure steps out. He's wearing a white lab coat. His skin is pale. His hair is black and long. His eyes are black. 

He steps toward me and grabs me by the arm. I struggle to resist, but he's too strong. 

As he pulls me into the room, I can feel my pulse racing. My throat tightens. I can't breathe. 

I try to scream, but nothing comes out. 

I wake up with a start. My chest is heaving. I'm panting. I can't catch my breath. 

I'm awake. 

But I'm still trapped in the dream.
