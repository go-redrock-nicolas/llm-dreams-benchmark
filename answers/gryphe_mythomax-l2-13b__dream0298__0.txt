I am dreaming. I can feel the warmth, the tenderness spreading through my veins as I experience an unexpected sense of compassion towards myself. It's as if a soft, gentle breeze has blown away the harsh criticisms and self-condemnation that I have been carrying around with me like a heavy load on my back.

I am suddenly aware of my surroundings; I see myself making a mistake - tripping over my words in a conversation or missing an important deadline at work. In the past, I would have beaten myself up relentlessly for such an error. But now, something within me has shifted.

Instead of berating myself for being clumsy or incompetent, I find myself offering comfort and understanding. It feels strange, but also incredibly liberating. Tears start to well up in my eyes as I whisper softly, "it's okay, sweetheart. We all make mistakes. Let's learn from this and move forward with kindness."

I can feel my heart swelling with love and appreciation for myself - for all the efforts I have made, for the strength I possess, and for the beautiful mess that I am. The dream fades away with a sense of calmness and contentment, leaving me feeling lighter and more at peace than I have in a long time.
