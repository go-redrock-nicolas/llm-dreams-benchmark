I am dreaming. And what a dream it is.

It's a beautiful place, a verdant forest, but one look tells me that something is...off.  The colors are too bright, even when they should be shadowed, as if everything is lit from within, an impression only heightened by the fluctuations in brightness that seem to dance across the landscape as if it were a living thing.

But that's not all.  As I walk, I step lightly, realizing that the gravity is shifting under my feet.  A rosy apple falls up from the tree and I snatch it as it passes me, taking a bite and feeling it fizz and sparkle on my tongue—it's like eating champagne, or perhaps a dream of champagne.

And time?  Time is a tricky beast here.  A flower blooms as I watch, so vivid and fast it's like a stop-motion photo.  A breeze passes and where leaves should flutter, I see a tiny whirlwind of color go from yellow-green to orange-red.

My survival needs are simple—all I must do is think of something I need, focus on it, and the world provides, in its own capricious way.  It is a world unlike any other, a phantasm...and yet it feels so real.  As I focus on a need, quenching my thirst, the scene shifts until I am before a crystal-clear waterfall, tumbling from a floating island above.  I drink deeply, and feel the water energizing me with every sip.

The world shifts again, and I understand: what is required of me is imagination, to dream freely and let the world shape itself to my desires.  It is a world that exists to be explored.

But then I feel a tug at the back of my mind, something pulling me away...and I realize it is time to wake up.  But there is something strange, something lingering, as if the dream were not just a dream, but a sign, that the world I return to is...more than I thought it was.
