I am dreaming. I find myself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers lurking at every turn. Everything seems desolate; the air tastes metallic, and the horizon is swallowed by a perpetual
I am dreaming.  I find myself in a labyrinth of jagged glass and rusted steel—a shattered metropolis where skyscrapers tilt like broken teeth, their windows gaping into abysses of smog-choked twilight. The air is thick with the acrid tang of burnt ozone, and the ground beneath my boots crumbles like sugar, revealing glimpses of skeletal subway tunnels eaten alive by neon-greenfungus. Somewhere in the distance, a howl—half-human, half-animal—rips through the static of a storm that never stops brewing on the horizon.  

Yet here, under a blood-red moon, I pause. A crystalline fountain shudders to life in the heart of the ruins, its water not liquid but a swirling vortex of stardust and memory. As I touch it, the ground quakes, and the city begins to **sing**. The rusted rebar hums a melody older than time, the shattered glass clicks in rhythm, and the very air pulses with the ghosts of lives that once thrived here. A figure materializes—a woman with skin like cracked porcelain and eyes like twin supernovas—and gestures toward a tower that defies physics, its spire piercing the firmament like a needle through parchment.  

Inside, the air is honey-sweet, and gravity bends. Libraries float on air currents, their pages rewriting themselves as I brush past. A book titled *Mirage & Moss* leaps into my hands, its cover soft as a moth’s wing. I open it, and photographs bloom: forests reclaiming concrete, vines strangling warheads, children laughter echoing in domes made of rainbows. But the final page is a map—of a world **yet to be**.  

Outside, the storms rage fiercer now, but I know the way. My shadow grows a root system, clawing into the earth, and the ground blooms with bioluminescent flowers that spell out coordinates. I climb, not up, but *through* dimensions—past walls of singing ice, a desert where every grain holds a frozen lightning bolt, and a cliffside where the wind weeps pearls. At the peak, I am not alone. Millions of fractured selves swirl around me, each carrying a fragment of what was lost: a child’s drawing, a single raindrop, the sound of a laughter_echoing.  

Then—I wake.  

But as my eyelids flutter open, I taste that honeyed air on my tongue. The city isn’t gone; it’s here, in the cracks of this world. Somewhere, a faucet drips like a heartbeat. I reach out, and my fingertips glow faintly, as if charged with starlight.  

This is no dream. Not yet.  

(What if the future we’ve been waiting for has always been a choice—to climb, to root, to let the ruins sing?)
