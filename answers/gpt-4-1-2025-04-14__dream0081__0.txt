I am dreaming.

I find myself in a strange, electric city—its spires gleam like silver needles thrust into a bruised twilight sky. Foreign words spill from neon signs, flickering in magenta and emerald across rain-slicked cobblestones. I’m traveling alone, lost in wonder and slight unease, the air thick with the scent of unknown spices and the distant promise of thunder.

Suddenly, news surges through the humming crowd like a wave of panic: political unrest has erupted. The palpable hum of the city hiccups, tilting into chaos. Sirens wail somewhere far and close. On every corner, uniforms appear—faces cold and closed, mouths tight with orders barked in accents I strain to understand. In an instant, digital screens blink crimson: “BORDERS CLOSED – NO EXIT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.”

Anxiety crawls up my arms and into my chest like cold mist. My passport feels impossibly fragile in my pocket, a useless talisman. I duck into an alley, pressing my back against cool, ancient stones, trying desperately to untangle the threads of panic. I see shadows move—other travelers, frightened locals. The world has shrunk, the map folding in on itself, all roads now dead ends.

Yet amid the worry, a secret corridor opens beside me, as if the city itself is sighing open a rib. Lanterns glow pale gold overhead as I slip inside, drawn by urgent hope. I enter a hush-full market—timeless, hidden—a sanctuary outside of time. Voices here speak a language that feels like memory, offering fruit that tastes of childhood and tea that warms with the calm of spring sunlight. An elderly woman presses a dried sprig of lavender into my palm, smiling with the wisdom of someone who has weathered many storms. “Borders close, dreams open,” she whispers softly, her voice like rain on parched earth.

As uncertainty rages outside, I find shelter here in the dream’s deep heart, among those who’ve also slipped through cracks in reality. We trade stories and laughter, sharing hope in every word. Through the distant rumble of unrest, I sense something vast and reassuring: in the labyrinth of fear, kindness conjures unexpected doors. 

And so I wait, drenched in golden lantern-light, listening to the comfort of voices and gentle music, knowing the borders of this dream will eventually open, and I’ll carry its strange magic back into waking life.
