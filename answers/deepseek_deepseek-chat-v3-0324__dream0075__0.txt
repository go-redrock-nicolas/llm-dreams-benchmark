I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Golden Feather**  

I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of ancient books and burning incense as I stand at the threshold of the Hall of Whispers, where the masters of the old world still linger in the shadows of memory. I have trained for years—burning my fingers on molten glass to shape perfect spheres, memorizing the cadence of every known language, threading silver filaments through the dark to weave constellations by hand. All of it has led to this moment: the final test to claim the **Golden Feather**, an emblem said to grant its bearer mastery over one forgotten art.  

The chamber before me is vast, its ceilings lost in a haze of blue smoke, and the only light comes from seven floating lanterns, each glowing a different hue. The Grand Arbiter, a figure robed in shifting silver cloth, beckons me forward without speaking. Their face is neither young nor old, neither man nor woman—only *knowing*.  

"You have until the last lantern fades," comes the voice, though their lips do not move.  

The test begins.  

First, I must **catch a note from the Song of the Dusk**—a melody that exists only in the breaths between heartbeats. Closing my eyes, I let my hands drift, plucking at the air until I feel the vibration hum against my fingertips. It burns like ice, but I twist it—a perfect, shimmering tone—before it dissolves. The first lantern dims to a soft ember.  

Next, I am given a basin of black water. "Find what was lost beneath," whispers the Arbiter. I peer in, and the water shows no reflection, only depth. Without hesitation, I plunge my hands in, ignoring the sudden ache as the cold gnaws at my bones. My fingers brush something smooth—a skull? A stone?—but I pull out instead a **laugh**, bright and clear, the sound I thought I'd forgotten from childhood. The second lantern flickers low.  

Time bends strangely here. The third challenge is a game played on a board of liquid mercury, pieces moving of their own accord unless I guide them with my will. Four hours pass—or is it four seconds?—before I force the last piece into place, and the third light winks out.  

The fourth test makes my blood run still: a needle, silver and thin as a spider’s thread, balanced on my palm. "This is the Thorn of Regret," says the Arbiter. "Withdraw it from your flesh, and you pass. Fail, and it will remain forever." I take a breath—then press the needle deep into my arm. The pain is immense, white-hot, but I do not flinch. Regret is a burden, yes, but also a teacher. After an eternity, I withdraw it, slick with my own blood, and the fourth lantern darkens.  

Only three remain.  

A mirror is brought before me, cracked down the middle, and I must reassemble its shards—but the reflection within is not my own. It shows faces I’ve never seen, lives I’ve never lived, a thousand fragments of could-have-beens. My hands shake as I fit them together, careful not to cut myself on the edges of lost futures. When the last piece slots into place, the fifth lantern extinguishes, leaving only two floating lights.  

Now, the true trial.  

The Arbiter places in my hands a bird—small, fragile, its feathers the color of twilight. "Give it the one thing it lacks," they say. The bird does not breathe. I cradle it, considering, then lean close and exhale my **own breath** into its still lungs. For a terrible second—nothing. Then, a heartbeat. A flutter. The sixth lantern gutters out.  

Darkness creeps in. The final light above me is faint, a mere smudge of gold in the black.  

"One last thing," murmurs the Arbiter, now barely more than a shadow. "Speak the name you have never been able to say aloud."  

A knot forms in my throat. The air itself seems to press in, strangling the words before they rise—but I must. So I whisper it, finally, and the sound burns like a star bursting into life.  

The last lantern goes dark.  

Silence. Then—  

The Golden Feather drifts down, alighting upon my palm, radiant as the first dawn. The Arbiter bows their head. "You have passed."  

And then, just before waking—  

The faint, distant sound of wings.
