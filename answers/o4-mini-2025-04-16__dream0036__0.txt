I am dreaming. You stand alone on a vast platform of midnight-blue glass that ripples beneath your weight like liquid ink. Above you, a sky of swirling amethyst and molten gold pulses in time with your heartbeat. Every breath you draw tastes of ozone and distant thunder, and with each exhalation the air shimmers, as if reality itself flexes around you.  

As you prepare for the challenge ahead, you reach down and let your fingers brush the surface of your cloak—a garment woven from starlight and shadow. When you lift it, motes of silver swirl into the air, dancing into constellations that wink and vanish. In the distance, a doorway yawns: its frame is carved from bone-white crystal, veins of violet light racing through it like liquid fire. Beyond that arch, the impossible world awaits.  

You probe your belt and find your tools arrayed in silent readiness. A compass whose needle spins in emotions rather than directions; a hollow sphere that hums with the recorded laughter of extinct galaxies; and a blade forged from the first breath of dawn, its edge humming with the promise of new beginnings. Each artifact hums against your hip, as alive as your own pulse.  

A soft chirr echoes behind you. Turning, you find a guide: a tall, winged creature whose feathers are spun from midnight and whose eyes hold the memory of every dream ever dreamt. It inclines its head, and in that gesture you recognize both comfort and warning. With a single step, it crosses the threshold—and the world beyond rushes to meet you.  

The moment your foot passes through the crystalline arch, the platform dissolves and you plunge into color. Rivers of prismatic light swirl around you, carrying whispers in a language you almost understand. Gravity loses meaning; you drift through floating isles of coral that sing lullabies and through forests of glass-walled trees whose leaves drip with liquid moonlight. Somewhere ahead, the Impossible Gate hangs open—a tangle of spinning gears and dripping icicles of time itself.  

You sense the mission’s weight settle in your chest: here lies the shard of fractured destiny, the key to healing a world teetering on the edge of unraveling. Your hands tighten around your tools, and though doubt hums in your veins, a fierce determination kindles in your chest. With a single steadying breath—tasting equal parts fear and wonder—you propel yourself forward into the heart of the enigma, ready to wrest the impossible from the jaws of dream.
