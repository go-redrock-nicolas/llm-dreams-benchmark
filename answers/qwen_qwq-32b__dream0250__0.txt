I am dreaming. I'm in a serene meadow, but instead of grass, the ground is soft moss glowing with an ethereal blue light. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and burnt copper, and the sky pulses like a bioluminescent liver. Five arachnid-figured sentinels with crystalline exoskeletons stand before me, their many eyes flickering with either curiosity or malice. I need to earn their trust to proceed, but their ritual involves publicly confessing my deepest shame—something I’ve never shared even with myself. My throat tightens as the eldest spider taps the ground with its front legs, forming a low, resonant drumbeat. The others chant in unison, voices like wind through hollow bones. I must choose: unravel or be eternally suspended in this mossy labyrinth.\n
