I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, ancient forest. The air is rich with the scent of pine and damp earth, and the dappled sunlight filters through the canopy above, casting a mesmerizing interplay of light and shadow on the forest floor. The forest hums with unseen life, the air rich with the sounds of rustling leaves, chirping birds, and the distant murmur of a rushing river.

As you walk, you notice a faint, shimmering trail that beckons you deeper into the forest. Your steps are light and deliberate, each one drawing you closer to something you can only feel instead of see. The trail leads you to a hidden glade where a winding stream gently meanders. By the stream, you encounter a small, stone cottage that seems to have been carved by the hands of nature itself.

The cottage's door is slightly ajar, releasing a soft, warm light and the wafting scent of freshly baked bread that pulls you closer. You push open the door and step inside, where the interior is warm and cozy, imbued with the comforting sounds of a crackling fireplace. A flickering light comes from several candles placed around the room, illuminating the small, well-equipped kitchen with a welcoming, homely touch.

As your gaze wanders, you notice a figure standing by a large, rustic table in the corner of the room. The figure turns, revealing a form within the enveloping cloak. You pause, unsure of their identity, as they approach and lift the hood to reveal a face filled with wisdom, kindness, and an aura of untold stories. Their deep, soothing voice gently resonates, “Welcome, traveler. You have arrived.”

In this dream, you feel deeply moved by witnessing another person's vulnerability. Responding to this authentic human connection, you step forward, heart open and spirits lifted, ready to share in their humanity, and both of you break bread together, intertwined in a timeless moment of mutual understanding.
