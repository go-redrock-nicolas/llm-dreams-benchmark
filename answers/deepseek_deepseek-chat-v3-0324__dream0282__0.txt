I am dreaming. The air around me shimmers like liquid gold, thick with the scent of ancient libraries—ink, parchment, and something darker, something alive. I am standing at the edge of a vast, mirrored lake, its surface so still it seems to swallow the stars whole. But the stars here are not stars at all—they are eyes. Thousands of them, blinking lazily from the depths, glowing in hues of sapphire and venomous green.  

A figure steps onto the water, their feet barely disturbing its surface. They wear a mask of polished bone, smooth and expressionless, yet when they speak, their voice is honey dripping from a blade. *"Tell me,"* they whisper, and the words curl into the air like smoke, *"do you believe in kindness without cost?"*  

Behind them, the lake begins to boil. Shapes emerge—people, hundreds of them, their hands outstretched, their mouths moving in silent pleas. Each one wears a halo of shimmering light, but as I look closer, the haloes are cages, thin wires of gold digging into their skulls. The figure tilts their head. *"Every act of charity is a thread,"* they murmur. *"A thread that weaves back into the self. To be admired. To be loved. To escape the teeth of guilt."*  

One of the pleading figures breaks free, stumbling forward. Their face is wet with tears, their voice finally finding sound. *"I gave everything!"* they sob. *"I asked for nothing in return!"*  

The masked figure laughs, a sound like glass shattering, and reaches into the supplicant’s chest. When they withdraw their hand, they hold a writhing, crimson worm, its body threaded with gold. *"Liar,"* they croon. *"You fed this creature every time you were praised. You let it grow fat on the hunger to be good."*  

The dream twists, the edges curdling like spoiled milk. The sky peels back to reveal a second sky beneath, this one pulsing with veins of iridescent light. The figure leans close, their breath cold against my ear. *"You see it too, don’t you? The truth in the dark. Even the saint craves their own salvation."*  

Then, the eyes in the lake blink in unison—and I fall, endlessly, toward them.  

I wake with my hands clutching at my chest, half-expecting to find something wriggling beneath my skin.
