I am dreaming. I find myself standing before an ancient oak tree in a forest that shimmers with an otherworldly light. The tree's massive trunk has a narrow opening—just wide enough for me to slip through. Inside, I discover it's hollow and houses a spiral staircase descending into darkness. Though every instinct warns me against trespassing into this clearly sacred space, I begin to create elaborate justifications: "I'm merely an explorer, documenting what others cannot see," I tell myself. "Knowledge belongs to everyone, and keeping secrets is its own form of wrong."

As I descend, the stairs become crystalline, each step illuminating with my weight before fading behind me. The air grows thick with scents of cinnamon and salt. I reach a chamber filled with thousands of glowing orbs—each containing what appears to be someone's most cherished memory. I realize these are private moments never meant for others' eyes, yet I find myself reaching for one, whispering: "I'll only look briefly, and this understanding might help me become more compassionate."

The orb warms in my palm, ready to reveal its contents. My conscience flickers like the distant light above, but I smother it with increasingly elaborate reasoning—"These memories are lonely without witnesses," "I was led here for a purpose," "Some rules exist to be questioned."

Then the orb speaks, in a voice like rustling leaves: "Would you want your innermost self displayed to strangers' curious eyes?"

I awaken with my hand still outstretched, the question echoing in my mind long after the dream forest has faded.
