I am dreaming. The dream begins.

I am exploring ancient catacombs, surrounded by darkness so suffocating it almost feels alive. My only light source is a flickering torch, its flame darting erratically, casting grotesque and shifting shadows on the damp stone walls. I move slowly, my footsteps echoing eerily through the narrow corridors, trailing my fingers along the rough walls to keep my bearings. My heartbeat quickens, the sound of blood rushing in my ears almost louder than the dripping of water somewhere in the pitch blackness. 

As I continue deeper, the torch sputters, its flickering light waning more frequently. The shadows twist and pool around me, a disorienting contrast of murky darkness and brief flashes of light, almost blinding in their intensity. My steps falter, uncertain as the light sputters more frequently until it is on the verge of going out completely. I brace myself, holding my breath, knowing that once the flame is gone, I will be consumed by the unknown around me. 

A scraping sound scratches against the stone in the distance. Something alive, but not human. My pulse spikes, every instinct in my body telling me to run. But the torch sputters again, and before I can move, the flame gutters out, leaving me in total blindness. My hand gropes the wall, my fingers slick with something moist and slimy, and my mind fills in the gaps with every childhood fear. 

I am paralyzed, consumed by the void, and it is in that perfect black void that my mind snaps, releasing a haunting cacophony of primal screams, as if the catacombs themselves have swallowed my voice and turned it against me.

I am left in the dark, frozen and alone, consumed by fear. The noise grows louder, and yet I cannot move, frozen in the voidâ€™s grasp. Waiting... for whatever comes next.
