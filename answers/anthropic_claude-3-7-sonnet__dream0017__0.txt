I am dreaming. The phone call comes as I'm standing in my kitchen, morning light streaming through half-drawn blinds, casting zebra stripes across the countertop. The voice on the other end is clinical, detached—words like "terminal" and "six months" hanging in the air like smoke that won't dissipate.

Instead of crumpling to the floor as the world collapses inward, I draw a breath so deep it seems to pull in all the surrounding air. My lungs expand beyond what seems physically possible. The oxygen floods my bloodstream, bringing with it an unexpected clarity.

I place the phone down and walk outside barefoot. The grass between my toes feels impossibly real—each blade distinct and meaningful. The sky above has transformed into an impossible watercolor of purples and ambers that shouldn't exist together yet somehow create perfect harmony.

I find myself smiling. Not the smile of denial, but of profound understanding. Time, previously stretched endlessly before me, has suddenly become precious and concentrated. The world appears sharper, more vibrant—as if I've been seeing everything through a dirty window that's suddenly been wiped clean.

I begin walking toward the horizon where mountains rise like ancient guardians. Each step feels weightless yet purposeful. Birds overhead form patterns that seem to spell messages meant only for me. The devastating news hasn't diminished my world—it has somehow expanded it, revealing layers of beauty and meaning previously invisible to my everyday perception.

In this dream state of profound acceptance, I realize I'm not escaping the pain—I'm transcending it, transforming it into something luminous and profound that radiates outward from my core, connecting me to everything around me with threads of golden light.
