I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a cliff, looking out over an ocean filled with stars. The stars shimmer like thoughts drifting through the darkness, each one a fragment of memory that refuses to be forgotten. The air is cool and smells of salt and distant thunder. It feels alive in a way that makes my skin tingle, as though I’m standing inside someone’s breath. 

In my hand, I hold something fragile—glass, perhaps, though it doesn’t feel solid like glass should. It’s warm and pulses gently, like it’s alive. I realize with a jolt that it’s their heart. The heart of someone I deeply care about, someone I’ve accidentally shattered with my careless words or thoughtless actions. As I look at their heart, I feel the weight of what I’ve done crushing down on me like a tidal wave, threatening to pull me under. 

I turn and see them standing beside me. Their face is luminous in the starlight, but their eyes are dim. The vibrant spark that always seems to dance behind their gaze has dulled, replaced by something raw and unguarded. They don’t look angry—they look broken, like the world beneath them has vanished along with their trust in me. My chest feels tighter than it ever has, and guilt floods me in waves, cold and relentless. 

They say nothing as I reach toward them, but the trembling of their chin and the way their shoulders sag seems to scream a hundred words they can’t bring themselves to say. The space between us shrinks, but it’s not physical. It’s the silence, suffocating and foreign, that fills the void where laughter and warmth once thrived. I want to say I’m sorry, but the words won’t come. My voice feels far away, trapped like the fragile glass heart I still hold in my trembling hand.

The ocean stretches out before us, the stars twinkling brighter now, as though the heavens themselves are watching, waiting for me to make it right. I drop to my knees, the heart between my palms glowing faintly as if it still clings to hope. I want to beg forgiveness, to stop the increasing ache tearing through me. I want to reach inside the horizon of stars and pull time backward—it doesn’t have to be this way. 

Suddenly, the stars in the ocean begin to ripple and bend. A strange current lifts the heart from my hands, pushing it gently toward their chest as if the universe itself is urging me to fix what I’ve damaged. I watch their body, transfixed, as the heart seems to merge with their own chest, threads of light mending what was torn. Tears begin to form in my eyes, blurring the world around me, but I know I’ve not been forgiven. Not yet.

Instead, the dream shifts ever so slightly—to a house we both know, a quiet place filled with old photographs and faded memories we once shared. The silence breaks as their voice washes over me—not sharp like I expected, but soft and tired, like the rain. “Why?” they ask, and the question pierces through me because it carries so much more than just blame; it carries longing, confusion, the aching wonder of how love turned into something fragile.

The dream spirals deeper now, and as my guilt floods me in waves, I try to find the words to answer, knowing they may not be enough.

The guilt feels alive, tugging at every corner of my soul, while the stars dim and the heartbeat of the universe slows. Nothing else matters here—not the ocean, not the thunder in the air—only this quiet space where I face what I’ve done and hope, if only faintly, that what’s broken can still find its way to healing.
