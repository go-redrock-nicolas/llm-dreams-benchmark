I am dreaming. **The Labyrinth of the Floating Hourglass**  

I stand on the shore of a vast, ghostly lake under a sky stitched with constellations I’ve never seen—twisted spirals of violet and gold, pulsing like slow, celestial heartbeats. The sand beneath my bare feet isn’t sand at all, but countless minuscule clock gears, clicking and shifting with each step. The air hums with a dissonant harmony, voices whispering just beyond comprehension.  

Then, the lake shudders.  

From its depths rises an enormous, fractured hourglass, floating impossibly above the water. Inside, instead of sand, shadowy figures swim like spectral fish, darting between moments frozen in mid-fall. Some figures resemble people I’ve known—but their faces flicker, distorted, as if caught between two lifetimes. One side of the glass drips time upward, defying gravity, while the other spills seconds like black tears.  

A voice—my voice, but layered, as if spoken by a hundred versions of me at once—echoes: *"You cannot count what hasn’t happened yet."*  

I take a step forward, and the lake mirrors not my reflection, but *scenes*—choices unmade, paths untaken. A version of me laughs in sunlight; another weeps in a rain-locked alley; one stares back, hollow-eyed, mouthing words I can’t hear.  

The gears beneath my feet shift. A single figure inside the hourglass presses a hand to the glass, and I realize with dawning horror—it’s *me*, but aged, scarred, fingers bleeding as though she’s tried to claw her way out.  

The sky cracks open. Time rushes backward, forward, sideways. My body dissolves into mist, scattering over the lake, and just before consciousness drags me back, I hear the figure whisper:  

*"You’ve been here before."*  

Then—I wake.
