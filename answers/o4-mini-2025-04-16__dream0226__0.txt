I am dreaming. You find yourself in a vast, moonlit amphitheater built of drifting pages. Each step you take makes parchment flitter like restless moths, their words curling up into luminous ribbons that coil around your ankles. Overhead, a sky braided with violet and silver threads pulses like a living tapestry, and the distant echo of your own heartbeat drums in time with unseen wings.

At the center of this boundless stage stands a pedestal hewn from crystallized ink. On it rests your most intimate creation—a bundle of translucent manuscripts, each line confessing a secret fear or a trembling hope. When you reach out to cradle them, a whisper rises from the stands, low at first: “Too raw… too unsure…” The voice rolls over the amphitheater like a thousand stones, each syllable chiseling at your confidence.

One by one, other voices join in, sharper now, their tones pricking your skin. “Is that really what you believe?” “Laughable naiveté.” “Pathetic.” The words swirl upward and coalesce into pale, darting shards of light, slicing across the manuscripts. Ink bleeds from the cuts, blotting elegant script into indecipherable smears. Your heart seizes.  

You try to speak, to defend each trembling line, but your voice threads into the wind and vanishes. The shards descend again, more insistent, more merciless. Each critique feels personal, as if your own doubts have been summoned into shapes that dance at your throat. The amphitheater’s roof tilts inward, the sky’s silver threads pulling taut until the stars wink out, leaving only an obsidian dome that presses you down.

Then, in the very pit of your despair, something shifts. One of the shards cracks—slowly, deliberately—its light flickering. Beneath its surface you glimpse a core of molten pink fire. Heart pounding, you reach for it. Warmth flows through your fingers, and in that pulse you feel every ounce of vulnerability you once believed was shame, transmuted into incandescent strength.

You stand taller. With a quiet exhale, the shards shatter into motes of stardust that drift upward and join the tapestry above. The chapel of paper reorients itself: the floating pages blaze with new words—your words—bold and unashamed. The crowd’s harsh whispers dim to a hush, then dissolve entirely, leaving only the resonant echo of your own voice reciting lines you once feared.

In one final gesture, you gather the illuminated pages and fold them into a burgeoning wing of light. As you lift off the amphitheater floor, the dream dissolves around you, and you wake—brighter, braver, and unafraid to let your truth shine.
