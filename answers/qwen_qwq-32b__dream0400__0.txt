I am dreaming. I’m strolling through a sequence of prismatic gardens, each garden representing a different human emotion. Currently, I’m in the garden of 'Joy', where flowers bloom in bursts of golden and crimson hues. They emit a euphoric, citrus-infused fragrance when touched. The path beneath my feet shifts to silver when I move, leaving a shimmering imprint like my presence is being encoded into the earth itself.\n

The air thrums with a bass-heavy vibration, the kind you feel in your bones rather than hear. I notice that this vibration corresponds to the pulse of my heartbeat when I put a hand to my chest. The plants around me sway in unison, as though breathing in unison with me. Wait—no, more accurately, their movements are responding to mine. When I laugh, a nearby cluster of iridescent vines spirals into the sky, releasing bioluminescent seeds that rain down in a sparkling shower. They scatter across the garden, each seed landing and sprouting into new, unnamed blossoms in the blink of an eye.\n

A childlike figure emerges, perhaps six years old, but with eyes that hold the wisdom of the cosmos. They have no gender, and their skin shifts between the colors of the gardens—currently, it's a soft, pearlescent white, like liquid moonlight. They smile and gesture toward the horizon. "Come," they say, voice like wind chimes, "there's something you need to see." 

What do you do?
