I am dreaming. You are drifting just beneath the surface of consciousness when the world ruptures. First comes the stillness: a vast, obsidian plain stretching to an ink-black horizon. In the center, a solitary, crumbling statue—your own shape, fractured at the waist, shards of marble tumbling into a yawning chasm. You stare, heart pounding, as if the ruin before you is proof that something vital inside you has splintered too.

A wind stirs, carrying the distant echo of sobs. As you approach the statue’s broken feet, the ground cracks like porcelain beneath each step. With every tremor, you feel a fresh ache in your chest, as though your heart is echoing the fracturing stone. Above you, the sky flickers—first bruised purple, then bleeding rose, then a searing, liquid gold. It illuminates the chasm and reveals a crimson river coursing far below, whispering a mournful lullaby.

You lean over the edge. Somewhere in that swirling current floats a small wooden box, tied shut with frayed ribbon. The box pulses with a soft, orange glow—as if inside lies the secret of your loss. The wind carries a word: “Open.” For a moment, panic seizes you. To lift the box out of that roar would be to claim your heartbreak. But you reach down anyway, fingertips grazing the ribbon. The earth convulses. The statue’s broken arm tumbles into the abyss, and you echo its fall with a cry.

In the split second before you lift the box, you find yourself carried away—drawn through a twisting tunnel of memories. Vivid scenes flicker past: laughter in sunlit rooms, a hand brushing your own, a door slamming shut. Each vision strikes you like ice, and then the memory shatters into a million glimmering shards that swirl around you, cutting at your cheeks but also illuminating hidden corners of your mind.

Suddenly, you’re plummeting into a lake of molten silver. The surface ripples and shapes into the face of what you lost—hauntingly familiar, impossibly distant. Tears brim in your eyes as you hear a voice, intimate and fading: “I’m here.” The words travel through the molten metal, warming it, dissolving it around you until you stand, dripping with quicksilver, on a smooth mirror. The reflection is you—eyes wide with shock, mouth trembling. And behind you, beyond the mirror’s frame, the broken statue stands whole again, gleaming, as though by reconstructing yourself you’ve mended what once was shattered.

A sliver of dawn light seeps in from above, turning the obsidian plain to amethyst. Around you, flowers of glass sprout from the cracks, blooming in delicate, impossible patterns. You bend to touch one; it gives way under your fingertips, scattering tiny prisms of light all around. Instead of pain, there is a curious warmth, an ember glowing inside your chest. The box you never opened has dissolved into dew on a glass petal.

You breathe in slow, deep pulls. Somewhere beyond that dream’s horizon waits waking life, uncertain but calling. In this twilight realm, though, you’ve discovered something both fragile and fierce: that within the wreckage of your own suffering, a seed of something new can root. And as your eyes open to the gray warmth of morning, you carry a single, shimmering petal in your palm—proof that from loss, beauty can still grow.
