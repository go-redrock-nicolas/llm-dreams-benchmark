I am dreaming. I feel intensely drawn to pursue something that others consider impractical or unwise. Following my authentic desires despite external
skepticism, I see a beautiful city floating in the sky.  It is made of crystal and light, surrounded by colorful clouds and rainbow beams.  The streets are paved with gemstones and diamonds, the buildings are shaped like flowers and birds, the homes are filled with music and love, the parks are full of playful animals and happy children, the restaurants serve delicious food and drink, the shops sell unique items and artwork, the theaters host amazing performances and shows, the churches celebrate faith and spirituality, the schools teach creativity and compassion, the libraries contain knowledge and wisdom, the museums display history and culture, the monuments honor heroes and legends, the stadiums host sports and competitions, the arenas host concerts and festivals, the beaches offer relaxation and recreation, the waterfalls provide refreshment and inspiration, the rivers flow with life and energy, the lakes reflect beauty and tranquility, the oceans extend to infinity and beyond. 

I want to live there.  I need to be there.  I must go there.

But how do I get there?  How can I reach it?  How will I cross the void and reach the sky?

I don't know.  Maybe I'll build a rocket ship out of cardboard boxes and duct tape.  Maybe I'll invent a new form of energy that can power my journey through space and time.  Maybe I'll find some magical friends who can help me solve all the problems I'll face along the way.

Or maybe I won't do any of those things at all. Maybe I'll just sit here in my dreams and imagine what it would be like to walk among the clouds and stars. 

Either way, I know one thing for sure: If I don't take this chance, if I don't risk everything for something better than this world, then I'm not really alive am I?
