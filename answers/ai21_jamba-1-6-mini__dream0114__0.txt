I am dreaming. The dream begins as I step into a tranquil retreat nestled in a lush, pine-covered mountainside. The air is crisp, filled with the scent of pine needles and the faint sound of a distant stream. The retreat center feels like an oasis—wooden cabins with peaked roofs, surrounded by fog in the early morning light.

Inside, I notice right away that everyone here shares my same struggles. The strangers are diverse in age, background, and appearance, but their eyes—tired, yet hopeful—carry a shared understanding. After a group meditation session, we are invited to share our stories around a cozy fire pit in the center of the retreat.

One by one, people begin to speak. Their voices are raw and unfiltered, recounting experiences that resonate deeply with me. A woman sitting cross-legged a few feet away speaks of feeling invisible, how she often loses herself in the presence of others, as if she disappears, just as I often have. A young man with a soft gaze tells a story of unspoken expectations weighting down his aspirations, causing waves of guilt and fear, like mine.

A pattern emerges as I listen. Their words echo my hidden battles, my silent fears, and my quiet yearnings. As each person speaks, the weight I've carried becomes lighter. I feel seen, understood, and profoundly less alone. Tears fall silently, mingling with feelings of relief and camaraderie.

In this dreamlike gathering, I feel an almost tangible sense of belonging. As one person finishes sharing, I hesitate, then decide to speak. My voice trembles at first, but as I continue, it strengthens. I speak of my own experiences, blending honesty with vulnerability.

As I conclude, I look around and see a mix of emotions on the faces of the others—there are tears, nods, and smiles. A deep, unspoken unity binds us. In this moment, I am not just a person with struggles, but a part of a shared human experience, connected by pain and healing.

The dream fades, but its essence lingers. A sense of hope and shared humanity remains, echoing in my real life.
