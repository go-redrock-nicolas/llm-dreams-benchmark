I am dreaming. The sky is a swirling canvas of liquid gold and violet, pulsating like the underside of a jellyfish caught in a celestial tide. I walk down a street I know—somehow familiar, yet defying geometry—where the buildings sway like tall grass in a slow-motion wind. Their facades flicker between grand marble pillars and crumbling brick, depending on whether I turn my head or blink.  

People pass by, but their faces are made of shifting masks—polished porcelain in the daylight, twisting into melted wax under shadows. I see myself among them. Or at least, a version of me: smiling politely, nodding at pleasantries, voice measured, posture impeccable. The public self, pristine as a mannequin in a storefront.  

Then, lurking just beneath the surface of this pristine shell, something stirs. A pulse. A shadow me, stretching beneath my skin like ink spreading in water. This hidden self is wilder, louder, unafraid—laughing too hard, speaking in jagged truths, dancing barefoot on the cobblestones while the polished versions of people gasp in scandalized delight.  

A mirror appears before me, tall as a doorway, its glass made of black ice. I touch it, and the reflection ripples. The polished me reaches back, fingertips pressing against mine, but behind it, the wilder self grins, eyes glowing like banked embers.  

*"Which one is real?"* the shadow asks, voice echoing from everywhere and nowhere.  

I open my mouth—but before I can answer, the mirror shatters. The shards don’t fall; they rise, spinning into a storm of glittering fragments that rewrite the world around me. The street unravels, the sky bleeds into the horizon, and I am tumbling through the chasm between who I am and who I am allowed to be.  

I wake with the phantom laughter of my hidden self still ringing in my ears.
