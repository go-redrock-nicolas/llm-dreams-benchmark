I am dreaming. I am in a dream.  

The air smells of ozone and possibility, thick with the scent of crushed petals and old parchment. My boots tread an invisible bridge of light, suspended between towering spires of obsidian and glass, their surfaces flickering with the echoes of forgotten spells.

My hands close around the light.  

And like a struck bell, the world *sings*—
