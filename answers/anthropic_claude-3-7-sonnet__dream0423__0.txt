I am dreaming. I float through a crystalline forest where trees grow upside-down, their roots reaching toward a sky of swirling purple and amber. The ground beneath me isn't ground at all, but a vast mirror lake that perfectly reflects the inverted woodland. Yet when I look at my reflection, it moves independently, sometimes smiling before I do, sometimes turning away to whisper secrets to the reflection of a moon I cannot see in my sky.

As I wander deeper, the trees begin to sing in harmonic tones, their leaves shedding not as foliage but as tiny origami birds that unfold in mid-air, becoming real before flying into spiraling wind currents. I follow them to a clearing where a massive clockwork heart pulses at the center, each beat releasing clouds of luminescent butterflies that spell out forgotten memories in their flight patterns.

The air tastes like childhood summers and possibilities not yet explored. I reach out to touch one of the memoriesâ€”suddenly I'm standing on an endless staircase that curves through clouds, each step transforming from marble to wood to water as my feet leave it.

Far below, an ocean of stories churns, each wave a different tale being told simultaneously in languages I somehow understand despite never having learned them. The horizon bends upward until it meets itself, forming a perfect circle around my perception.

I realize my pockets are filled with seeds that glow with gentle blue light. When I scatter them into the air, they don't fall but orbit around me like planets, growing into miniature worlds where entire civilizations rise and fall in moments, their tiny inhabitants occasionally glancing my way in acknowledgment of their dreamer.

And throughout it all, there's a distant melody I recognize but cannot name, drawing me ever forward toward something both intimately familiar and entirely unknown.
