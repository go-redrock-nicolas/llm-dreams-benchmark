I am dreaming. As you find yourself trapped in the labyrinthine building, a sense of dread washes over you, mingling with the sweat beads forming on your brow. The walls, once sterile and unremarkable, now pulse with an ominous red glow, their surfaces contorting and twisting, becoming elongated and jagged. You hear scratching sounds echoing from the depths of the structure, gradually growing louder and more insistent.

Your heart races as you survey your surroundings, searching for any hint of a safe exit. But the corridors seem to stretch on endlessly, cunningly hiding their twists and turns, like a serpent coiling about to strike. From the corners, you catch a glimpse of figures--first glimpses and then gone: a woman struggling and crying for help, an old man cowering in fear, a child opening his mouth in a silent scream. All of them, just for a flash, and then they're gone, consumed by the ever-shifting shadows that ricochet off the undulating walls.

As you venture deeper into the maze, the air grows thick and oppressive, like breathing through a thick layer of cotton. The scratching intensifies, now a cacophony of frenzied claws and fangs, accompanied by a deep, guttural laughter that seems to emanate from the very walls themselves. The dream becomes more feverish, the colors more saturated, the sensations more heightened.

Suddenly, the floor beneath you gives way, and you plummet into a bottomless pit. As you fall, the building transforms around you, morphing into a monstrous, megalithic structure that reaches up towards the heavens, its spires and turrets crescent-arcs in status of some twisted, alien priests. You hurtle through its gigantic windows, shattered glass and holy mantras spilling out around you, tumbling through its black heart.

As you finally touch down, the situation turns even more treacherous. Hunter killer spiders that are the size of rhinos burst from the wall, backed up by a pack of enormous red-eyed wolves that dwarf you, their muzzles frothing with foamy drool. The monsters spare you not a glance, they have 'hit lists.' The priest, dressed in tattered robes, stands before you, his eyes burning with malice, his staff crackling with eldritch energy.

You must act quickly, for the creatures are closing in, and your life hangs in the balance. Time is short, your heart is pounding, and panic rises in your throat as your consciousness strains to wake up from this nightmare. But for now, you remain trapped, a pawn in this horrifying game, as the building's sinister energy pulses around you, a twisted symphony of despair and madness.
