I am dreaming. You're trapped in an elevator, a metallic cage that's usually your trusty steed to the floors above, now a Gunki approaching you with malice, intent on swallowing you whole. The ceiling lights flicker anxiously, casting an eerie disco effect on the water as it hydroplanes up the walls, claiming inch after inch of the once-safe space.

The hum of the elevator's motor, usually so reassuring, now mocks you, sputtering and coughing like a smoker trying to hide its habit. The shaft around you, a dark abyss in daylight, transforms into a watery chasm, roaring with the muted fury of a tamed beast gone wild. The steel cables supporting you snap taut, groaning under the sudden strain, echoing the scream in your throat, unyielding as the water climbs.

Your heart hammers against your chest like a prisoner banging on bars, demanding freedom. The air grows thick with humidity and fear, condensing on your skin, beads of sweat mingling with the droplets dancing around you. You can taste the salt of the sea in the air, a stark reminder of water's power, its insatiable hunger to reclaim what was once its own.

The elevator lurches, jolted by an unseen force from below, a leviathan rising to challenge your rapidly dwindling sanctuary. The water level surges, cresting like a wave, washing over your shoes, seeping into the fabric, kettling your feet, traps of flesh and bone. You kick off your shoes, but they're already buoyed by the encroaching tide, bobs in the water, mocking your futile attempts at escape.

The water claws at your clothes, trying to rip you from your grounded existence, to pull you down into the swirling darkness below. You fight back, grasping onto the fold-down emergency seat, your knuckles white, veins pulsing like desperate rivers against the tide. The cold seeps into your bones, numbing digits, chilling your resolve.

Your breath comes in short, panicked gasps, a symphony of desperation mingling with the symphony of the sea. The water creeps up your legs, your thighs, licking at your waist, reaching for your chest, your face, your life. The elevator walls seem to shrink, the ceiling dips, the world closing in, a metallic tomb eager to entomb you.

Suddenly, a glimmer of hope - the control panel! Your fingers, clumsy with cold and fear, trace the buttons, prayers tumbling from your lips like a child's mantra. "Help me... someone, please..." You press the emergency button, a scream in the silence, a desperate cry for help. A shrill alarm pierces the night, a murder of crows cawing a warning, aREQUEST FOR AID.

Time slows, each drip of water falling like an eternity, each breath a battle, each second a torturous eternity. The water laps at your chin, your eyes, your world narrowing to the point of no return. And then... silence.

Darkness claims you, your world submerged, your struggle over. Yet, in the depths of despair, a light flickers. A glimmer of hope to pull you back from the brink, to shock your heart back to life, to refuse to let you go down without a fight. You're not ready to give in, not ready to disappear in the flood. You're a voice screaming in the silence, a heart beating in the dark, a dreamer refusing to wake up. You're fighting the flood, and you'll be damned if you go down without a fight.
