I am dreaming. 

You find yourself repeatedly engaging in behavior that provides immediate comfort but long-term problems. Breaking this self-defeating cycle, you decide to face your fears and challenges head-on. You feel a surge of determination and strength.

Suddenly, you are transported out of the dream world into the real world. Your mind is confused and disoriented for a moment.

You open your eyes and see yourself lying on your bed in your room. You wonder if it was all just a dream.

But then you remember your resolve from the dream. You feel a renewed sense of purpose and energy. You get out of bed and start your day with confidence and determination.
