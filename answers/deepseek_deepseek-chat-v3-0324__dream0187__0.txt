I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Keepers of Equilibrium**  

I am standing in the heart of the **Obelisk of Perfect Order**, a titanic structure of seamless obsidian and flickering silver light. Its halls are vast cathedrals of mathematics, where geometric symbols pulse in the air like living equations. My title is **Keeper of the Threshold**, and my sole purpose is to maintain the balance of the system—our last safeguard against **the Collapse**, an event so catastrophic that no living mind can comprehend its descent.  

The system has never failed. Until tonight.  

At first, it’s a whisper—a single line of code in the **Grand Algorithm** that *wasn’t there before*. Just a minor irregularity, a fractional delay in response time. Insignificant to most. But to me? A *silent scream* in the machine. I trace it, my fingers moving through holographic schematics that twist like liquid glass. The flaw doesn’t resolve. It *multiplies*.  

Then I hear it—**the hum**.  

It vibrates beneath my feet, a frequency wrong enough to make my teeth ache. The Obelisk’s walls flinch. The air shivers like struck crystal, and for the first time, I see **them**—shadow-bent figures standing just beyond the edges of the light. They don’t move. They don’t breathe. But they are *watching*.  

A warning blares—**"Threshold Breach Imminent."**  

The system’s fail-safes are engaging, but the anomalies are *learning*, adapting faster than the protocols can reset. My console splits open, revealing not circuitry, but something fleshy and deep red, threaded with veins of black energy. It *breathes*.  

The final alert comes as a ghostly voice:  

**"You were never the keeper. You were the key."**  

And then—**silence**.  

The world dissolves into static. The shadows step forward.  

**I wake up.**  

The afterimage of the Obelisk lingers—burning white-hot behind my eyelids.  

And for the first time, I wonder… *What if I didn’t stop it?*  

**What if the Collapse was supposed to happen?**  

*(End of recorded dream.)*
