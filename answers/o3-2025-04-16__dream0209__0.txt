I am dreaming. …must first unlearn everything my waking body believes about distance, weight, and time—because in this place none of those ideas have survived.

The instant the dream begins in earnest, I find myself standing (or what passes for standing) on a lattice of glowing indigo filaments that crisscross an endless void the color of wet obsidian. Gravity, as I know it, has dissolved. Instead the realm is braided together by three exotic forces the locals call Lilt, Loom, and Lex.

Lilt  
Lilt is the push-pull of emotional resonance. Every feeling I release—wonder, fear, mischief—erupts from my chest as a cloud of shimmering motes. Those motes tug me in whatever direction the emotion prefers. Wonder drifts upward, fear drags downward, curiosity spirals sideways like a lazy corkscrew. To advance I must compose the correct mood in my heart. I summon excitement, and the filaments spring open like a woven gate, vaulting me forward in buoyant bounds.

Loom  
Loom is the stitching of intentions through matter. Here, objects are more suggestion than substance, so a single thread of concentration can braid them together or unravel them entirely. When I cup my hands, the space between my palms warps and twists into a translucent ribbon road. I step upon it and it bears my weight because I believe it should. Skepticism makes it fray; conviction makes it tauter than steel.

Lex  
Lex is the grammar of sound. Spoken words are not passive vibrations but architect’s blueprints that harden the air into structures. I try an experimental utterance: “Arch.” The syllable launches from my lips as a luminous arc that curves overhead, forming a bridge of pearlescent consonants. A second word—“Echo”—rings out and the bridge splits into countless smaller walkways, each repeating itself in soft, receding copies until they vanish beyond sight. To erase a construct I simply hum a minor chord; the melody melts the letters like wax.

Navigating  
Travel, then, is a dance across delicately balanced forces: choose a feeling, weave an intention, speak a word. I practice: awe, path, stride. I glide along a crystalline promenade that stitches itself together underfoot, each step preceded by luminous runes that bloom out of nothing and fade behind me once I pass.

Fauna & Flora  
Creatures drift through the void like living constellations. One, a translucent manta trimmed with stardust, floats near, propelled by gentle pulses of its hope-colored wings. Another resembles a bouquet of glass feathers orbiting a central ember. They feed on tone, inhaling stray syllables the way whales gulp plankton. A careless shout would be a banquet, so I murmur instead, and they swirl around me in polite curiosity.

The native “plants” are loops of crystalline circuitry rooted in nothing, blossoming with chords rather than petals. Each bloom emits a continuous F-sharp that folds itself into the background hum. When two blooms resonate in harmony, they braid a new strand of filament between them, expanding the lattice like a self-composing song.

A Problem of Return  
As wonder deepens, I feel a tug—Lilt again, but colder. Homesickness. It topples my balance: the filaments beneath flicker, my conviction wavers, the road dissolves. I begin to descend, drawn toward an abyss where jaded memories congeal into heavy black anchors. I realize I need a contrary cocktail: nostalgia strong enough to point toward home, yet laced with excitement so the force lifts rather than drags.

So I inhale the scentless dream air and exhale a memory: the first time I saw snowfall under a streetlamp. A silver hush, a hush of possibility. The motes glow pearly white and rise, tugging me upward. I lace that feeling with anticipation—there is more to learn above, I think—and suddenly I’m buoyant.

I weave Loom into a silver umbilical strand, tying my present self to the idea of my waking body. “Portal,” I speak, and Lex obliges. The word fractures into a halo of vowels—O’s orbiting like moons, A splitting into twin crescents, L stretching into a doorway.

Crossing Back  
I step through. Sound collapses into silence. Color fists itself into darkness. Weight finds me again with a jolt that thuds through my bones. I’m sprawled in my own bed, dawn fingering the curtains, heart still fluttering with residual starlight. For a breath or two, the old forces—gravity, inertia, time—feel like thin imitations. But when I close my eyes I swear I can still taste Loom’s metallic sweetness on my tongue, and I wonder if, tonight, a single whispered syllable might tear the veil open once more.
