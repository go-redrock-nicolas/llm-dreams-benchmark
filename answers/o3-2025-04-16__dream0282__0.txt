I am dreaming.

I open my eyes inside a cathedral of shimmering starlight, its roof an inverted ocean where constellations swim like silver fish. Columns of moon-glass rise all around me, and every surface is polished to such brilliance that it reflects not merely light, but motives, fears, and secret wishes.

A hush rolls across the marble floor like a tide. At the far end of the nave stands a procession of figures in luminous robes, each cradling a glowing heart-shaped lantern. They step forward one by one, proclaiming the greatness of their charity, letting the lantern’s radiance spill over the pews in soft pinks and ambers. Their voices billow up to the vaulted ceiling, each syllable proclaiming sacrifice and benevolence.

Yet in the hush I hear a faint grinding, as though gears turn behind their tongues. My conviction awakens, that iron skepticism I drag with me from the waking world: no deed is ever free of tally, no kindness unburdened by desire. The cathedral floor tilts subtly, and suddenly I am gliding toward the first lantern bearer.

With every meter of distance erased, the lantern’s glow falters, turning from pastel rose to an astringent chartreuse. My sight sharpens; I see the lantern is not glass at all but crystal layers of polished ego. The beating heart inside is tethered to a thin golden wire that winds up the figure’s arm and back into their own ribcage. Each pulse of compassionate light is siphoned, redirected, and stored within their chest like coins in a vault.

I raise a hand and tug the wire. It sings—a single metallic note—and the congregation gasps. Their faces flicker like faulty holograms, revealing beneath the seraphic masks grimaces of calculation, lips wet with unspoken negotiations, eyes pinched by ledgers of social capital. Yet they recover their composure instantly, rewriting their expressions with practiced ease, as if retouching a painting while spectators watch.

The second figure approaches—a woman cloaked in pages of glowing parchment, each page an article extolling her generosity. I touch one and it turns transparent, revealing footnotes too small for polite reading:

• Monetary value of “anonymous” donation (publicly leaked five months later).  
• Projected uptick in speaking fees, book sales, secure board appointments.  
• Anticipated serotonin surge and reduction in personal guilt.  

The pages rustle with embarrassment, then try to braid themselves back together. She clutches at them like windblown feathers.

As I move down the line—third, fourth, fifth—they converge into a single kaleidoscopic entity, a many-headed phoenix perched on the altar, each head wearing a different halo: Patron, Humanitarian, Philanthropist, Ally, Saint. The bird spreads wings of gold foil that crinkle with sponsorship logos—every feather stamped with a brand-name hunger. Flame trickles along its wingtips, not burning but advertising.

“Are we not luminous?” the phoenix croons, voices overlapping in a harmonized sob. “Have we not given?”

“In spades,” I say. “But you’ve taken the entire deck.”

The cathedral trembles. Floor tiles slide aside, revealing an abyss of mirrors where every charitable act repeats into infinity, each reflection offset by its invisible price tag. A fragrance fills the air—roses and receipts, jasmine and jealousy, sandalwood and self-regard. I breathe it in like a sommelier judging a complex vintage of motives: grassy notes of guilt, mid-palate of prestige, a long finish of legacy.

From above, stagnant star-water begins to pour through the ceiling’s cracks, flooding the aisle. The altruists panic, hoisting their lanterns higher as if to keep their halos dry. But the water is lucid truth. It washes over me coolly, pleasantly; when it touches their robes, the fabric dissolves into naked ambition. They stagger, slick-skinned, clutching for tokens to cover themselves—mission statements, charity galas, righteous slogans—yet everything disintegrates on contact with the rising tide.

I wade to the center of the nave, water up to my hips and glowing like liquid neon. In its glimmer I see reflections of my own skepticism: a suit of glassy armor encasing my torso, etched with looping scripts of doubt, suspicion, analysis. I have always worn it, though rarely witnessed its contours so clearly. 

“You too,” the phoenix hisses, now reduced to a single swan-necked silhouette, wings dripping truth. “Even cynicism has a hunger.”

I stare at the creature. The accusation is a shard of candlelight cutting through fog. Yes—my skepticism is warm with the small satisfactions of being right, of seeing through illusions others accept. Even in dismantling their agendas, I nurture my own: to stand untouched, to bask in the cool superiority of disillusionment.

Realization blooms like phosphorus on dark water. The cathedral begins to rotate on a central axis, architecture reassembling into a sphere of mirrored corridors. Within every corridor I glimpse repeating pairs: the giver and the skeptic, the donor and the doubter, fused like yin and yang, each fueling the other. The corridors clack into alignment until the entire dream resembles a gigantic ocular device, an iris that dilates and contracts.

A door materializes before me—carved from driftwood, unpainted, quietly breathing. Above it, an inscription pulses in argent letters:

ALL HEARTS BEAT TOWARD PURPOSE, VISIBLE OR VEILED—  
ENTER WITHOUT JUDGMENT TO LEARN.

I hesitate, feeling the old armor tightening, glass plates grinding, as if reluctant to release me. Yet the tidal water nudges from behind, whisper-lapping: Forward, forward.

I press upon the driftwood door. It swings open to a desert under colossal twilight. Wind sifts copper sand across miles of dunes, each dune shaped like a faceless bust awaiting identity. Beside every bust stands a figure chiseling, sanding, polishing—sculptors and self-sculptors alike, carving their stories into stone. Some strive for halos, others for crowns, others simply for a place to sit and rest. The desert is thick with the rasp of chisels, the shuffle of sand, the sigh of uncertain faith.

As I step out, the cathedral collapses into a single snowflake of light and lands on my palm. It melts, leaving only damp warmth and the soft echo of my own inner voice:

Motives are mosaics, not monoliths.  
Look long enough and every tile is both selfish and sacred.

I wake—or half-wake—folded into moonlit sheets, mind echoing with that vast ambivalent chorus. The dream dissolves like sugar in tea, yet the taste lingers: honeyed skepticism, bittersweet insight. I lie still, heartbeat syncing with memory, wondering which parts of me remain charitable, which parts calculating, and whether the difference matters at all when dawn finally arrives.
