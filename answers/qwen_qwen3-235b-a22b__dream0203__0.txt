I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a cathedral of impossible geometry—a city sculpted from paradox. Towers spiral upward in Fibonacci sequences, yet their peaks fold inward like Möbius strips, vanishing into their own shadows. The sky is a tessellation of hyperbolic tiles, each fragment reflecting a different dimension: one a desert of infinite cubes, another a sea of liquid tetrahedrons. You breathe in, and the air tastes of chalk and static, as though the universe itself is scribbling equations onto your tongue.  

At the center of this labyrinth floats a shape. It defies all logic: a polyhedron with seven faces, each face a perfect circle. When you approach, the circles warp into spirals, then fracture into fractal patterns that hum with a low, resonant frequency. You realize, with a jolt of vertigo, that the object is both *inside* and *outside* itself simultaneously—a Klein bottle rendered in four dimensions, its surface area infinite yet contained within a space smaller than your palm.  

You reach out, and the paradox *reaches back*.  

Your fingers pass through it, but not in a straight line. Instead, they curve around an invisible axis, tracing a path that loops through your own ribs, your own skull, as though the geometry of your body has been rewritten. You feel your heartbeat echo in the hollows of the shape, syncing to a rhythm that is neither regular nor chaotic, but both. A voice—not a voice, but the *idea* of a voice—whispers:  

**“Solve me.”**  

You try. You sketch diagrams in the air with glowing ink that evaporates before your hand can lower. You attempt to measure the polyhedron’s angles, but your protractor melts into a helix of numbers that spell out contradictions: * = 3.14… and also  = . Zero equals one. Parallel lines converge in seven places at once.* The axioms you’ve known since childhood unravel like thread pulled from a god’s tapestry.  

Frustration blooms, then awe. You abandon Euclid, Archimedes, Descartes. You invent a new calculus on the spot, where curves are straighter than lines, and points have volume. You draw a triangle whose angles add to 200 degrees by folding it into a fourth dimension, then flatten it into a circle that rolls sideways through time. The paradox shudders, its circles blooming into spheres, then into *something* with too many edges to name.  

Suddenly, you’re not solving it—you’re *becoming* it.  

Your mind fractures into a dodecahedron of perspectives. You see yourself standing in the city, but also inside the shape, also as the shape, also as the void that contains it. You grasp that the paradox isn’t a problem to be fixed, but a language. A dialect of the universe spoken in contradictions: light and dark, particle and wave, the zero and the infinite all dancing in a waltz older than time.  

The city shifts. The towers collapse into a single point, then explode outward as a fractal nebula. The polyhedron dissolves into a droplet of mercury that rolls into your ear, whispering:  

**“You are the axiom now.”**  

You wake, gasping.  

Your hands tremble. On the back of your wrist, faint and glowing, is a symbol—a circle with a line through it, but the line is serpentine, alive, eating its own tail. You laugh, a sound that vibrates in a frequency only dogs and mathematicians might hear.  

Somewhere, in the liminal space between sleep and waking, the universe has rewritten its rules.  

And you remember them.
