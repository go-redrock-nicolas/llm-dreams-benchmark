I am dreaming. My dream is vivid and complex. I find myself in a grand marble chamber, circular in design, with walls that shimmer like mercury under moonlight. The air hums with tension, charged like a coil about to spring. Before me stands a large obsidian table, its surface etched with glowing runes that pulse faintly, as if breathing. Seated around it are seven figures—each cloaked in robes of shifting hues, their faces obscured by masks resembling animals and celestial symbols. The atmosphere is thick with anticipation, their voices resonating not just through sound, but through vibrations that crawl along my skin.\n\nThe first speaker, wearing the mask of a silver hawk, leans forward. "We must decide," they intone, voice like wind through canyon stones, "whether to sever the root or prune the branches." Their words ripple across the chamber, causing the runes to flare crimson. I notice the figure’s gloves are stained with what looks like dried blood.\n\nThe second figure’s mask is a writhing serpent, shifting scales glinting menace. "Folly," they hiss, breath cold enough to frost the air. "The root sustains us! To cut it invites chaos." Around the table, others murmur. One, a stag-masquerade, nods slowly while another, a faceless void in velvet, taps their chin rhythmically—a beat that contradicts the chamber’s natural pulse.\n\nAs the debate escalates, the room begins to warp. The floor tilts; the ceiling spirals into a vortex of stars. I realize each participant’s mask flickers slightly, revealing brief glimpses of their true features beneath—yet every face is mine. Panic knots my stomach. Are they reflections? Avatars of facets of my own mind? Or constructs of a far greater conspiracy?\n\nThe hawk-masked figure slams a clawed fist on the table. The runes explode into white light. In that blinding flash, I see fractal visions: a root system pulsating underground, cities crumbling into dust, a shadowy figure cloaked in twilight manipulating threads connecting all life. When sight returns, the chamber is gone. I’m standing alone on a cliff overlooking an ocean that mirrors the star-spiral above. The masks hover in front of me, whispering in unison: *Choose.*
