I am dreaming.

I step forward, and the ground beneath my feet unfurls like a roll of velvet midnight—each intention I harbor births something new and bewildering. My thoughts tangle and bloom, rising like phosphorescent vines that coil into existence, their leaves whispering the names of forgotten emotions. The sky above is a liquid canvas, morphing from saffron gold to the color of the inside of seashells as soon as I wonder what evening looks like here.  

I consider flight and, without effort, my arms sprout delicate feathers, pale as moonlight, and the air gathers thick and warm under my wings. I soar upward, slicing through clouds that burst into confetti of fragrant, glowing petals. Below, rivers adapt their current as I dream them braver—now flowing upside down, arching through the air and cradling mirrored cities beneath their glossy surfaces.

With a stray thought, impossible creatures form and dissolve at the edge of my vision: a fox with iridescent scales instead of fur, a flock of glass-winged butterflies that hum harmonies no waking ear could decipher. The world itself bends to my whims—gravity spins sideways, letting me stroll up the trunk of a tree whose branches drip honey and starlight alike.

As curiosity carries me on, I imagine gateways of swirling color suspended in the air. Each portal leads to a realm born from the fragments of my desire: a city of libraries where stories whisper themselves, a desert where every grain of sand holds a memory, an ocean where gentle leviathans sing in chords that summon laughter and tears.

Here, every boundary is a guideline written in vapor; every possibility, only a thought away. Wonder and awe pulse through me, and for each sensation, the dream world shivers and expands, never quite the same twice. In this place, even the impossible hushes, pliant, and waits for me to imagine it into being.
