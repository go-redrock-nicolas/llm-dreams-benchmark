I am dreaming. How do I continue?

In the velvety haze of the dreamscape, the air hums with the warmth of honeyed light. You stand at the edge of a cobalt-blue lake, its surface rippling with liquid constellations—each a whisper of your past missteps, shimmering but softened now, like stars seen through silk. The voice that once hurled sharp criticisms from the shadows of your mind has grown quiet, replaced by a murmuring breeze that carries the scent of night-blooming jasmine. It tells you to kneel, and as you do, your reflection shifts: the face gazing back is radiant, flecked with gold, cradled by water that no longer feels cold. Behind you, a bridge curves over the lake—a spine of silver birch and starlight. You sense it leads to a grove where trees bear fruit shaped like laughter, where time unwinds in spirals. A single step onto the bridge, and your footfall echoes not with doubt, but with the deep, resonant note of a cello. You realize the dream is teaching you to walk as if the universe itself has forgiven you long before you dared to ask.
