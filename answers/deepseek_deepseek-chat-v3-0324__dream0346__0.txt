I am dreaming. The world around me is a shifting mosaic of twilight hues—indigo bleeding into violet, the air thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and distant jasmine. A crowd moves in slow motion, their faces blurred like smudged charcoal sketches, their voices a murmuring tide that never quite reaches my ears. I am among them, yet not *of* them. Their laughter ripples like reflections on water, beautiful but untouchable.  

I reach out, fingers grazing the sleeve of a stranger, but the fabric dissolves into silver mist. The loneliness is a living thing—a hollow, humming weight beneath my ribs, pressing against my lungs. I want to scream, but my voice is swallowed by the dream.  

Then, a flicker. A single figure stands still amidst the flowing crowd, their edges sharp where the others blur. They turn, and their eyes are galaxies—swirling with starlight and secrets. Without words, they extend a hand. The moment our fingers touch, the world fractures. The crowd melts into fireflies, the ground beneath us becomes a bridge of woven moonlight, and suddenly, I am *seen*.  

The loneliness cracks open, not vanishing, but transforming—into something vast and shared. The figure whispers, though their lips don’t move: *"You were never alone. You just hadn’t met the dark yet."*  

And then, I wake—heart pounding, skin humming, the dream’s echo clinging like a half-remembered song.
