I am dreaming. The world around me is a vibrant tapestry of surreal landscapes and impossible architecture, stitched together by the fragile threads of my subconscious. Before me stretches a vast valley, its undulating hills made not of earth, but of shimmering liquid glass that shifts hues with every beat of my heart. Skywards, enormous orbs of light float in perfect synchrony, casting long, dancing shadows that seem to whisper secrets only I cannot decipher.

I walk—no, drift—across this landscape, barefoot, feeling the gentle undulations beneath my soles, as though the ground is breathing with me, alive and symbiotic. Everything glows faintly, radiating abundance: golden trees made of molten light ripple softly in a wind I cannot feel, their branches heavy with luminous fruit that hums when touched. Streams of liquid silver wind through the valley floor like living veins, pulsing rhythmically, carrying nutrients of thought and memory from one glowing nexus to the next.

And yet, deep within me, a quiet gnawing persists.

I feel empty.

My hands reach towards the bounty, but they pass through the fruit as if it were mist. I kneel to the silver rivers to drink, only to find them evaporating before my lips meet the surface. Around me, life flourishes in infinite, mesmerizing forms—jewel-feathered creatures soar between floating islands, singing in harmonic tones that vibrate through my ribcage—but I feel isolated, detached, as if watching all of this through the wrong side of a telescope.

There is abundance here. I know it objectively. My eyes tell me so. My dreamscape overflows with immeasurable wonders. Still, the sense lingers: I am lacking.

And so I descend, intending to discover why.

In the heart of the valley, I find a mirror—not of polished metal, but of frozen lightning. Its jagged surface ripples with fragments of my reflection, each piece slightly different, distorted like the echo of a forgotten name. As I peer into the electrical glass, I notice faint lines curling across its surface—equations, ancient prophecies, circular patterns like fingerprints at the edge of time.

My hands tremble as I touch it. The mirror shatters—but doesn’t break. The fragments reunite in slow motion, forming new images.

A child, laughing beneath stardust rain.

An old house, filled with voices I no longer hear.

A door left ajar at midnight.

Each image pulses with emotional resonance, each moment a breadcrumb dropped long ago, forgotten until now. I begin to understand: the scarcity I feel stems not from externals, but from perceived disconnection—from myself, from those I love, from the thread of continuity within.

And then, like a key turning in a forgotten lock, a warmth blooms in my chest.

The dreamscape shifts.

The trees bend toward me now, roots lifting from the glassy soil, and begin to move like dancers. The silver rivers rise and shape themselves into bridges that connect the floating islands above. The air, once empty, fills with the scent of my grandmother’s garden in a forgotten summer. Around me, the dream world doesn’t *contain* abundance—it becomes *an extension of me*. Every color, every sound, every shimmer reflects not scarcity, but longing transformed into connection.

I exhale… and dreams breathe back.

In the final moments of the dream, the mirror giggles like a living thing and becomes a portal. On the other side, I see myself walking through a normal day in the waking world. But now I see the abundance—the laughter in a child’s voice, the warmth in a cup of tea, the history held in a well-worn book. It was always there. I just forgot how to receive it.

Then the dream ends, not with a snap—but with a sigh.

And somewhere deep within me, something changes.
