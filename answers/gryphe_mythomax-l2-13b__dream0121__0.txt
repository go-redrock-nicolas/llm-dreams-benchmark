I am dreaming. The scene opens with me, standing in a grand hallway, surrounded by marble pillars that stretch up to a vaulted ceiling with intricate frescoes. The walls are adorned with oil paintings of the past leaders of this esteemed institution, whose accomplishments and contributions have left an indelible mark on history.

As I stare, taking in everything around me, a gentle voice interrupts my thoughts. "Mr. Johnson, you've been invited to step forward."

I turn around, my heart pounding against my chest. Standing before me is a group of elderly men and women, clad in robes of dark red and gold. Their eyes hold a mix of curiosity and apprehension as they study me intently. My heart feels like it's about to burst from my chest when I realize that I've been unexpectedly selected to lead this prestigious institution despite lacking traditional qualifications.

As I step forward, the crowd parts, revealing a dais at the end of the hall. Sitting upon it is a throne made of solid obsidian, its surfaces glossy and mirror-like. Beside it stands a pair of intricately crafted scepters, one gold and the other silver, both topped with jewels that wink and sparkle in the dim light.

The crowd around me begins to murmur, their voices a low hum of disbelief and surprise. I can feel their skepticism washing over me like a cold wave, but I force myself to remain steady and composed. After all, this is an opportunity of a lifetime - one that I refuse to let slip through my fingers.

As I ascend the steps towards the dais, my thoughts turn to the challenges that lay ahead. I know that leading an institution of this magnitude will not be easy, and there are bound to be many obstacles and setbacks along the way. But I also know that I have the drive, determination, and intelligence to overcome them.

Finally, I reach the top step and kneel before the throne, eyes fixed on the glittering scepters. The elderly council members watch intently, waiting for me to speak.

"Thank you," I begin, my voice echoing off the marble walls. "Thank you for this incredible opportunity. I promise to uphold the values and traditions of this institution while also pushing it forward into the future. Together, we will make history."

With that, I grasp the scepters in my hands and rise to my feet. The crowd erupts into applause, their skepticism replaced by respect and admiration. As I take my place on the throne, I know deep down that this is where I belong. The dream fades away, leaving me with a sense of purpose and determination that lingers long after I wake up.
