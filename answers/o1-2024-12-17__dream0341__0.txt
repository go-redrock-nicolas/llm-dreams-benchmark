I am dreaming. …find yourself standing at the threshold of an ancient stone courtyard bathed in warm, golden light. You’re holding someone’s hand—a child, perhaps—whose face you can’t quite see no matter how hard you try. There’s a hurricane brewing on the horizon, churning violet clouds that crackle with electric-blue lightning, drawing ever closer. Each thunderclap feels like it rattles through the marrow of your bones, but you keep standing there, determined to protect the trembling shadowchild by your side.

A voice from nowhere and everywhere whispers, “You must keep them safe.” Suddenly, the courtyard’s cobblestones begin to shift beneath your feet, transforming into archways that spiral upward like living vines. The child’s grip tightens on your fingers, eyes wide with the same fear that’s bubbling in your own chest. You want to console them, but no words form in your throat. Instead, you press them against your side, feeling the frantic drumbeat of their tiny heart.

Just then, a gust of storm wind slams into the courtyard’s ancient walls, propelling shards of broken pottery and torn leaves in every direction. The child screams—a high, piercing spasm of terror that slices through your eardrums—and you cradle them behind you, shielding them as best you can. The swirling winds are relentless. The air crackles. You glimpse swirling, shifting shapes within the storm’s folds, monstrous silhouettes that seem to waver between this reality and somewhere else, as though they could vanish at will.

Even so, your responsibility fuels you like a shock of adrenaline. You press forward, one determined step at a time, ducking under the swirling debris. The walls around you crumble, weathered stone crashing into dust that glitters oddly in the half-light. You can’t abandon the child—your very essence tells you so. Every surge of wind tries to force you back, but your feet stay anchored. Something protective, powerful, almost magical surges in your chest. Your fingers grow warm with purpose, and you know you’re meant to continue forward.

The child whisper-shouts your name, and instinct takes over. You guide them toward a crooked stone archway that stands like a fortress in the courtyard’s far corner. At the center of the archway is a swirling portal of liquid mirrors, bending reality with prismatic flickers. The storm hurls all the fury of lightning and thunder behind you, and you half-run, half-stumble toward the portal’s rippling surface. As you near it, your heart hammers against your ribs, yet hope sings through your veins at the thought of escaping the cataclysm.

Just as you stretch out a hand to touch the swirling threshold, the portal shifts. The reflection stares back at you, but it’s not quite your own face—it’s distorted, as though thousands of years of sorrow and worry pass over its features in a single breath. The air grows suddenly still, an eerie pause before the storm unleashes its final wrath. Your chest tightens with the weight of the child’s wellbeing. You can’t let them down, not when every fiber of your dream self resonates with a promise to protect them.

Summoning your courage, you pull the child closer and plunge headlong into the shining surface. The liquid mirror envelops you both, sending a tingling wave from the top of your scalp down to your toes. The storm and the courtyard vanish in an instant, replaced by the hush of a night sky filled with impossibly bright constellations. Earthy moss cushions your feet, and towering silver trees gesture overhead, branches rustling as though whispering secrets to one another.

The child stands by your side, calmer now, their eyes reflecting the starlight. Though you still don’t see their face clearly, you sense their relief like a gentle breeze. You’ve succeeded in guiding them somewhere safe—at least for the moment. Yet, a subtle current of dread traces beneath your relief: the storm might still find you, however far you’ve traveled.

You hold the child’s hand and gaze up at the swirling galaxies above, contemplating how you’ll continue shielding them, no matter where your dream wanders next. The flicker of distant lightning rolls faintly, a reminder that your responsibility is only just beginning. But you square your shoulders, determined and confident that you can meet whatever challenge arises. This is your dream, after all, and keeping this precious person safe feels as essential as drawing breath—an unbreakable vow echoing in every corner of your dreaming heart.
