I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me is not the world I know.  

The sky is a liquid tapestry of indigo and violet, swirling like ink dropped into water, alive with constellations that pulse like distant hearts. Stars are not points of light here—they are living things, shifting and whispering in a language of soft, radiant hums. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and something deeper, earthier, like damp soil after the first rain of spring.  

Beneath my bare feet, the ground is not solid but a shifting mosaic of glowing moss and silvered roots that rise and fall with a slow, rhythmic breath. The trees—oh, the trees—are towering sentinels with bark like polished obsidian, their leaves translucent and shimmering with bioluminescent veins. When the wind moves through them, it doesn’t rustle—it sings, a chorus of low, resonant notes that vibrate in my chest.  

A path unfolds before me, not carved but *willing* itself into existence, petals of iridescent blue and gold unfurling with each step I take. I know, without knowing how, that this is a place between places—a realm where time is not a line but a spiral, where every possibility exists all at once.  

Then, I see them—shapes in the mist. Not people, not quite, but presences woven from starlight and shadow. They move like liquid, their forms shifting between human and something else, something vast and ancient. One reaches out, and though it has no hand, I feel the brush of its touch against my mind.  

*Remember,* it murmures, not in words but in a flood of sensation—warmth, sorrow, joy, the taste of salt on the wind. *You are more than the waking world has told you.*  

And just as I open my mouth to speak, the dream shivers—not breaking, but bending, reshaping itself into something new. The sky folds inward, the trees bow like reverent giants, and I realize, with a thrill of wonder, that I am not just in the dream.  

*I am the dream.*  

And then—I wake. Or do I?
