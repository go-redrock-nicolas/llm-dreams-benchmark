I am dreaming. In the depths of your slumber, your mind transports you to a surreal and harrowing scene deep within the deepest parts of your imagination. You find yourself abruptly trapped in a cramped elevator, the metal walls cold and unyielding against your trembling form. The air is thick with an underlying hum of fear, an eerie atmosphere pressing in on you from all sides.

As your heart begins to pound, you notice an unsettling sight through the glass doors. The elevator shaft stretches out before you, pulsating with a dim, ethereal light. To your growing horror, you realize that the shaft is rapidly filling with a mysterious,-dark liquid. The level rises steadily, creeping closer to you with every passing second.

Panic surges through your veins as the water level inches upward, slowly encapsulating you in this watery grave. Your breathing becomes more shallow, your chest constricts with each gasping breath you take. The ascension to your final floor seems to slow down as if the world around you has frozen, time itself dwindling to a trickle.

You slam your fists against the control panel, the buttons providing no solace as they remain cold and unresponsive. Desperation reaches its peak as the cold liquid threatens the air left in the elevator. Fragments of memories flash by in sequences, like stills from a movie projector, the nostalgia fading as the dark liquid replaces them. The chilling eerie pulse of the light outside the elevator grows louder and louder in sync with your heartbeat.

Trapped within this metallic coffin, your body begins to tremble, your vision starts to blur, and your mind snakes with a wannabe resolve. The water level keeps rising, the pressure suffocating any hope of escape. With every passing second, the eerie light pulses stronger and the water creeps higher, mimicking a tide swallowing you whole.

Your mind reaches its peak, a distant beacon of salvation flickers in the background, as the water finally reaches the last bit of air left in the elevator. You can't hold your breath any longer, the water filling your puit awaiting the inevitable last gasp.

A dark silhouettes flashes across the blurring vision, a familiar voice calls out your name, and in a last effort, you reach out for it, hoping that salvation will take you out come the last drop of breath you have. But just as you're about to let go to the depths of your own demise, you jolt forward, frantically gasping for air. Your body is drenched in cold sweat, the sheets wrapped tightly around you, and the room spinning from the sudden awakening.

You take in deep breaths, your eyes scanning the dark room, the familiar surroundings finally coming back. A shuddering sigh escapes your lips as your mind begins to process the experience. For a moment, you were truly in the depths of consciousness, faced with a terrifying scenario that haunted your every breath. Yet, as the cold sweat begins to evaporate and your breathing returns to normal, you can't help but wonder if that trip into the deepest parts of your imagination was truly real.
