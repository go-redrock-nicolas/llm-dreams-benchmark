I am dreaming. I find myself in an opulent conference room with ivory marble walls that seem to glow from within. Plush carpet the color of midnight wraps around worn leather armchairs arranged in a sprawling command center. At the head of the space, two figures loom - the Kings of opposing realms Lord Jack "The Iron Fist" Blackwood and Lord Dean "The Golden Tongue" Morrison.

Tension crackles thickly in the air. Lord Blackwood's battle-tested armor catches the light, every dent and scratch telling tales of brutal conflict. His eyes flash cold steel, unrelenting and merciless. By contrast, Lord Morrison wears an immaculate gold-threaded suit that sparkles with calculated refinement. His silver-flecked beard curls into a calculated smile, but his gaze holds sharp calculation.

Between them stands the luminous Heart Crystal, humming with ancient power. This precious artifact contains the monopoly on advanced force field technology, a deciding factor in dominance over the warring realms. Both leaders expect my allegiance, knowing that I hold the rare ability to attune the crystal's power.
