I am dreaming. The emotion sweeps over me unexpectedly—a sickly green wave of jealousy that catches me off guard. I'm standing in a vast exhibition hall, walls soaring to impossible heights with skylights that filter sunshine into golden pools on the marble floor. Around me, people mill in admiration before a collection of artwork that seems to glow with its own inner light. 

At the center stands someone I recognize but cannot name—their face shifting subtly between familiar features—accepting praise and accolades for what everyone is calling "revolutionary work." The paintings speak to viewers in ways mine never could, colors breathing and moving across canvases that seem alive.

The jealousy tightens in my chest, constricting like a vine with thorns. I want to turn away but cannot. I want to diminish their achievement but know it's magnificent. This is my passion, my dream, my pursuit—yet they've reached heights I've only imagined.

As I stand rooted in discomfort, I notice something strange happening to my hands. They're becoming translucent, revealing not bone and blood but thousands of tiny, unfinished paintings, each one a moment of inspiration I'd abandoned or a technique I'd never fully explored.

The realization filters through me like light through stained glass: my jealousy isn't about their success—it's about my own unfulfilled potential. Each abandoned creation represents a time I chose safety over risk, perfection over progress.

I move toward the celebrated artist, feet barely touching the floor. When they turn to me, their eyes hold galaxies of possibility rather than competition. "I've been waiting for you," they say, voice echoing strangely. "There's room for both our visions in this world."

The exhibition hall begins dissolving around us, walls becoming mist, revealing an infinite landscape of blank canvases stretching to the horizon, each one humming with potential. My jealousy transforms, alchemizing into determination—not to outshine another, but to finally bring my own light fully into being.
