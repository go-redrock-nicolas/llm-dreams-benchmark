I am dreaming. I my dream, I find myself floating in an endless sky, the clouds beneath me a mosaic of iridescent hues that shift from coral pink to deep indigo with every breath I take. My body feels weightless, buoyed by an unseen current that carries me toward a colossal structure suspended in the air—a spiraling citadel made entirely of shimmering glass, its spires twisting like frozen flames. As I drift closer, the citadel’s surface begins to ripple, revealing countless doorways, each framed by constellations that pulse in time with my heartbeat. A whispering chorus fills the air, voices weaving in languages I both recognize and cannot name, urging me to choose a door. But before I can decide, the scene dissolves, and…you land gently on a floor of liquid silver, rippling beneath your bare feet. The citadel is gone, replaced by a labyrinth of mirrors that stretch infinitely in every direction. Each surface reflects not your face, but scenes of gatherings—a council of feather-clad beings debating inside a hollowed comet, a parliament of shadow-animals growling in a cave lit by bioluminescent fungi, children with galaxies for eyes scribbling in floating notebooks. The air thrums with urgency; some reflections shout in bold, neon colors that warp the glass, while others flicker faintly, their voices trapped in moth-wing whispers.  

You raise your hands, noticing they now glow with a pearlescent luminescence. The light leaks from your fingertips, forming threads that snake toward the muted mirrors. When the threads touch the glass, the dim scenes flare vividly—a woman made of storm clouds begins to articulate thunder-poems, a tree with faces in its bark hums a harmony that stabilizes the trembling air. But the dominant voices rebel: a mirror depicting a lion-headed orator roars, its soundwaves cracking nearby reflections into jagged shards.  

You pivot, instinct guiding you. Drawing a breath, you exhale a chord that resonates like a struck bell, freezing the shattered glass midair. Each fragment becomes a prism, refracting your light into beams that stitch the broken scenes back together, their edges now gilded. A door materializes in the maze—a threshold woven from willow branches and stardust. Beyond it, a circular chamber appears, its center a pool of liquid obsidian. Around it hover masked figures, their features shifting each time they speak.  

One by one, you beckon the once-silent reflections into the room. The storm-cloud woman merges with the pool, her tempest-tongue rippling the black surface into a mosaic of rain. The tree’s song roots into the floor, sprouting crystalline flowers that emit soft chimes. Even the lion’s roar softens, melting into a purr that vibrates through the chamber like a bassline. A child’s galaxy-eyes widen, and suddenly the room is a snow globe of swirling planets, each orb a voice, no one orbit overpowering another.  

Yet in the dream’s logic, tensions linger. A shadow at the edge, unnoticed until now, unfurls into a serpent with eyes like dying stars. *"Balance is a lie,*" it hisses, dripping venom that corrodes the edges of the pool. *"Someone must drown so others may drink."*  

You step forward, but the storm-cloud woman acts first. Her thunder-poems condense into a bolt that splits the serpent’s tongue. The tree’s roots surge, binding its coils. And then—surprise—the lion leaps, not to attack, but to shield the trembling child, whose tears now bloom into new constellations above.  

The chamber stills, the serpent dissolving into smoke that spells a riddled phrase in the air: *Whose silence feeds your light?*  

You wake just as the letters twist into a door handle—one you recognize from the glass citadel, still waiting. Your hands, no longer glowing, tingle with the hum of unfinished symphonies. The dream lingers in your throat, a vow and a question, as the first morning light claws through your window.
