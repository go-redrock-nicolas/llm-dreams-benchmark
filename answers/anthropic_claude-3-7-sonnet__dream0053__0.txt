I am dreaming. I find myself in the lobby of a once-grand hotel, now transformed by my subconsciousness into something ominous. Art deco chandeliers swing ever so slightly though there's no breeze, casting fractured diamonds of light across marble floors that seem to ripple like disturbed water beneath my feet.

The air tastes metallic and sweet—like electricity and cotton candy. From somewhere distant comes the gentle melody of a music box, playing a tune I almost recognize but can't quite place.

As I take my first uncertain steps, the floor tiles behind me begin to crack and fall away into an endless void. The crumbling spreads outward like a disease, forcing me toward a corridor lined with mirrors. In each reflection, I see myself—but not quite myself. My mirror images move a half-second too slowly, their eyes following me with hungry interest.

I dash past them into what appears to be a grand ballroom where the ceiling drips a luminescent blue liquid that sizzles when it touches the floor. The droplets form patterns, arrows perhaps, guiding me toward a spiral staircase. Or warning me away? The liquid pools are expanding, connecting, becoming a flowing river I must leap across.

The staircase winds upward impossibly high, each step playing a different musical note beneath my feet. Behind me, I hear the sound of shattering glass—the mirrors have broken free of their frames and are in pursuit, reflecting nothing now.

At the top of the stairs, I emerge into a greenhouse filled with plants that whisper my childhood secrets as I pass. Their leaves reach out to brush my skin, leaving behind shimmering trails of pollen that map my journey through rooms that shouldn't connect but somehow do.

The building shifts and breathes around me, corridors narrowing and widening like arteries with a pulse. Windows look out onto impossible landscapes—underwater cities, floating mountains, forests where the trees grow downward from the sky.

I feel the building's heartbeat now, syncing with my own as I navigate toward what I hope is freedom—a door made of light at the end of a hallway where the wallpaper patterns swirl and change when I'm not looking directly at them.

The music box melody grows louder, more urgent. Time is running out as the floor beneath me grows soft like quicksand. I reach for the glowing door, my fingers passing through it like water, and then...

I am falling upward, through layers of reality, back toward waking.
