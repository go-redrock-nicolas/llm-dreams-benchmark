I am dreaming. …feel the world ripple like a pond struck by a stone.

You and your friend—let’s call them Lyra—stand in a cathedral of midnight-glass trees. Their trunks are obsidian mirrors, reflecting starfields instead of faces, and the sky overhead is the strange color that exists only between violet and indigo, as though twilight and dawn were trying to occupy the same breath. Wind hums through crystalline leaves, each note a fragment of a forgotten lullaby.

Lyra trembles, shoulders shaking beneath a cloak woven from slivers of moonlight. Their voice arrives in stuttered pulses, equal parts thunder and whisper: “I tried to keep it from you. I wanted to spare us both.”

Your heart answers with a bass-drum thud, echoing through your bones. “Spare us from what?”

They lift their hand. Cracks zigzag across their skin, red-gold light leaking through like sunset pouring from a smashed lantern. When they finally look up, tears diamond their lashes and fuse into glowing droplets that float rather than fall.

“I’m the storm,” they say. “The one that’s been chasing you all your life. I didn’t mean to be, but I am.”

At first you don’t understand, so the dream rearranges itself to explain: overhead, clouds swirl into a vast, spinning iris—an eye stretched across the heavens. It blinks, and lightning veins the air in branching arcs that trace your intertwined histories. You see memories play out on each flash: quiet lunches, whispered jokes, shared promissory smiles—then darker images you never witnessed, scenes of Lyra alone, wrestling a tempest of self-blame.

The wind rises, tasting of sea salt and static. Lyra’s cloak unravels, moonlight threads whipping into the gale. They clutch their chest, where the cracks widen, spilling a miniature galaxy like sand that glints with nebulae.

“I’ve been carrying this,” they sob. “I’m the reason your nights fill with thunder. My secret storms leak into your life.”

Something inside you, equal parts fear and fierce love, unfurls. You remember times you woke from unnamed dread, heart stampeding, and how Lyra’s texts always arrived just then: You okay? Couldn’t sleep either. Now the pattern clicks—those nights they were fighting to keep the storm shut inside.

The forest darkens. Trees tilt, leaves chiming frantic hymns. Glass trunks fracture under invisible pressure. The sky-eye dilates, hungry.

You step forward, feeling the ground pulse like a heartbeat. “Then we share the sky,” you say. “We stand together in it.”

Your words hang luminous, turning into silver seeds that drift on the wind. Where each seed lands, a new sapling sprouts—living wood instead of glass—roots drinking the spilled starlight. Color floods the forest, emerald and mahogany replacing obsidian, birdsong layering over the brittle music of before.

Lyra gasps, as though what you’ve done siphons pain from them. The cracks in their skin begin knitting themselves together, star-sand flowing back beneath. But the eye above still spins, unplacated.

You reach out. Your hand burns cold where it touches Lyra’s, yet the sensation is yours alone to bear; you refuse to let go. “Tell me everything,” you insist. “The storm and all its names.”

Lyra exhales, and their confession pours out—a river of images: childhood shame locked in thunderheads, fear of abandonment thunderbolting through every relationship, guilt crystallizing into hail. As they speak, those memories rise like phantom storms, then dissolve into gentle rain, hissing steam as it meets the forest floor.

With each truth, the sky-eye fades, iris unraveling into harmless cloud ribbons. Lightning thins to glowing threads that weave into a dawn-colored horizon. Finally, only a single low rumble remains—like a lion clearing its throat before settling to sleep.

Lyra’s shoulders slump, relief draining them. The repaired skin over their heart now bears a faint constellation-shaped scar—proof of what broke, and what mended.

You pull them into an embrace. Where your tears touch their cloak-less shoulders, flowers bloom—night-lilies, impossible and luminescent. They fill the clearing with perfume that smells of first chances.

In the hush that follows, the dream draws back to show you both reflected in a still pond that has replaced the shattered ground. Two figures glow there: partners in vulnerability, wielders of shared weather. Above, the sky resets to a perfect canvas awaiting new stories—blank yet bright with quiet promise.

And in this lucid hush, you realize: the storm isn’t an enemy, only a raw language neither of you had learned to speak—until now, in this cathedral of born-again trees, where every leaf is an exclamation of hope.
