I am dreaming. The velvety curtain sways gently as a backstage hand parts it, revealing the dazzling lights and your dark shadowy dressing room. You hear the murmurs of the audience, the embodied buzz of hundreds of people waiting for a legendary performer. You had been lurking in the shadows of the theater, watching the vibrant and electrifying stage all evening. 

The director of the show bursts into the room. His face is painted with a smorgasbord of worry, desperation and hope "Madam... Our lead performer just collapsed.  I know it is short notice, but.. Will you save us each from ruin? I saw you admire her performance earlier." 

You nod slowly and feel your chest tighten. The adrenaline starts pumping through you as you hurtled toward the stage. No costume. No warm up. No rehearsal. You are dressed only in an old black tee and trousers. The teeming, expectant crowd starts to murmur again. Their voices dissolve to silence as you stride onto the stage. 

The stage is unforgivingly bare, free of trap doors, delays, prompts and prompters. It is bare as the day you were born. You ponder what to do next in your dreamy hypnagogic state. The eerie silence echoes over a thousand expectant faces. You see the gamete of their eyes... hopeful, doubtful, disinterested, and expectant.

The strange crowd seems to be that of a mix between intelligent loxodonta africana and hyracotherium. You imagined this crowd from the deepest folds of your imagination. You try ambulating across the stage. Your nihil vampiris and reflexion dream of amatogen. You sense a Poofish shadow lurking behind the curtains. 

You begin the show. The strange audience unifies in appreciation of you. Their voices rise to a cacophony. They start marionettishly dancing to the sound of their own deaths

All of this puzzles you from the depths of your homeostasis and consciousness. You wonder if you have achieved videodreamsia and terteraenesthesia.
