I am dreaming. I stand at the prow of my ship, The Celestial Vanguard, as the wind shrieks like a chorus of ancient spirits. Towering walls of water rear up on either side, each crest tinged with phosphorescent blue—an otherworldly glow that makes the spray sparkle like a thousand diamonds flung into the air. Salt stings my eyes and throat, but I taste something else, too—a faint trace of honey and thunder.

My crew huddles on deck, drenched to the bone, their faces pale but determined. They look to me, their captain, for a beacon amid the chaos. The rigging groans overhead. I twist my cloak around my shoulders and lay my calloused hand on the helm. Beneath my fingers the wood thrums as if alive, echoing my heartbeat. “Hold fast!” I shout, voice nearly lost in the gale. “We carve a path through this wild sea!” Each syllable feels like fire on my tongue, igniting courage in their eyes.

Lightning forks across the sky and, for a heartbeat, I see something beyond the storm: a colossal silhouette rising from the depths—an ancient leviathan whose scales shimmer like black obsidian. Its eye, vast and emerald-green, fixes on us. Fear lodges in my chest, but I whip it away. In this dream, I am more than mortal—I am attuned to the pulse of all things. I raise my arms, chanting a wordless verse that thrums with power. The helm’s thrum answers, waves bend, momentarily parting like curtains.

The crew gasps. The leviathan arches its back, submerged again, and the sea falls eerily calm. It is as if the world holds its breath. I feel the wind shift: no longer punishing, but guiding. I whisper, “Steady,” and The Celestial Vanguard surges forward on a cushion of moonlit water. Stars peek through shredded clouds, revealing a phantom coastline studded with bioluminescent forests and mountains that drift like islands in the sky.

As dawn breaks, the storm dissolves into a watercolor haze. My exhausted crew gathers around me, eyes shining with awe. Somewhere in the distance, the leviathan’s mournful song drifts over the waves, a lullaby to herald our safe passage. I close my eyes, feeling the ship’s gentle roll beneath me, and know that—even in the fiercest tempest—the heart of a true captain turns chaos into wonder.
