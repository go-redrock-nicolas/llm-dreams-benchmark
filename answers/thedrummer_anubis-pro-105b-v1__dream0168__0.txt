I am dreaming. I'm dreaming I find myself in the midst of a perturbing and tumultuous emission. The room is dimly lit, the walls scuffed with dull, lifeless grays and beiges that seem to suck the very colors out of the space. I'm at the helm of a bustling operation center, surrounded by banks of flickering screens and lines of frantic personnel, rushing to and fro with worried expressions etched across their faces.
