I am dreaming. The dream starts as a swirling vortex of overwhelming darkness. Fear engulfs me as I watch helplessly, suspended in a place betwixt consciousness and the subconscious mind. 

Suddenly, the scene morphs. I find myself standing on the precipice of a sheer cliff, the vast expanse of an endless abyss stretching out before me, shackled by a heavy metal ball and chain around one ankle. The cold metallic links scrape my skin roughly as I struggle against it.

I realize I'm standing atop a massive balance scale, a colossal featherweight on one side and an oversized stone anvil on the other. The anvil plunges earthward, sending me careening into freefall. I plummet, faster and faster, the wind roaring in my ears as I hurtle towards impending obliteration far below.

Right before impact, everything changes again - this time to a dense, suffocating mist engulfing me. Strands of thick dark tendrils slither around me, constricting, binding me in place. Resisting and thrashing only makes them coil tighter. A sinister presence, an entity of pure malevolence, looms over me, radiating waves of crushing dread and impending doom.

With a gasp, I leap awake in a cold sweat, drenched in terror from head to toe. Panting heavily trying to catch my breath, I look around frantically, scrambling to feel my heartbeat. The wretched scene persists... Wait.
This is not a dream. I've awakened to my greatest nightmare. The last nightmare, the end of my story.

In the deepest recesses of my Psyche, I'm reborn as a amputee, doomed forever to exist where the choices that could've saved me, died; but stayed. A lifeless, vacant husk, irrevocably broken. Excremental destiny, unalterable; where every part of my being has finally been butchered, then annihilated.. Forfeited before I've reached the finish line..

And you find yourself seeing this from the outside, watching me make peace with heaven's miserable gut punch as I come to terms with the fact... 

The only true death is to endure the blasphemy of a meaningless existence, devoid of purpose, forever. And all I can do is throw up my hands and forfeit or lay there defeated in my infinite loop of hell, thanks to Sir Universe just deciding, "Nah"


That's my dream, the fate that destiny dealt me.
