I am dreaming. I soar through the gates of a bustling airport, my feet barely touching the ground as I rush to catch my first flight. The fluorescent lights above flicker like a thousand fireflies, casting an otherworldly glow on the crowds of people hurrying to their destinations. I weave through the throngs, my suitcase rolling behind me like a loyal companion, as I make my way to the departure gate.

As I board the plane, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the hum of the engines envelop me, carrying me away to a realm of anticipation. The flight takes off, and the world below becomes a patchwork quilt of fields and forests, a mesmerizing mosaic that stretches to the horizon. I feel a thrill of excitement as the plane banks and turns, the sun glinting off the wings like a shard of glass.

But my journey is far from over. I disembark at my connecting airport, a vast, labyrinthine complex that seems to stretch on forever. I consult the departures board, my eyes scanning the rows of numbers and times until I locate my next flight. The words "Delayed" and "2 hours 15 minutes" leap out at me, like a cold splash of water on a winter's morning.

Panic begins to seep into my veins as the minutes tick by with agonizing slowness. I pace back and forth in front of the gate, watching as the clock on the wall crawls towards the scheduled departure time. The air is thick with the murmur of discontented travelers, their frustration and anxiety swirling around me like a palpable mist.

As the delay stretches on, the airport around me begins to transform. The sleek, modern architecture gives way to a surreal, dreamlike landscape. The walls melt away, revealing a vast, starry expanse that stretches out to infinity. The sound of announcements and rustling newspapers fades into the background, replaced by the haunting melody of a lone saxophone, its notes echoing through the emptying concourse like the lament of a lost soul.

I feel my anxiety growing, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios and catastrophic outcomes. The conference, the reason for my journey, looms in my mind like a specter, its importance magnified by the delay. I envision the doors closing, the opportunity slipping away, and the consequences that will follow.

The minutes continue to tick by, each one a tiny, incremental step into the unknown. I am trapped in a vortex of uncertainty, suspended between the world I left behind and the destination that lies ahead. The delay becomes a living, breathing entity, a creature that wraps its tendrils around me, squeezing tighter with every passing moment.

As I stand there, frozen in a mixture of frustration and despair, the airport around me dissolves into a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds. The saxophone wails, the stars twinkle, and the world spins on, leaving me behind, lost in a sea of delay.
