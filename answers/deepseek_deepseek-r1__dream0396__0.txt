I am dreaming. As time warps around me, I stand in a place that shifts fluidly between the deepest ocean trench and the highest mountain peak. My steps make ripples in the molten core of the Earth one moment, then crunch through glacial ice the next. The horizon pulses with impossible colors - indigo flames licking at a sky that's simultaneously dawn and midnight. Gravity reverses abruptly, sending me tumbling upwards until I laugh mid-air, realizing fear isn't necessary here. Shadows take shape as living equations, writhing in perfect fractal patterns that explain quantum entanglement through ballet. A flock of translucent jellyfish dragons swirl past, their trailing tentacles humming melodies in harmonic resonance with my heartbeat. When I open my mouth to sing back, entire civilizations rise and fall in the vibrations between my vocal cords.

I am floating through an iridescent nebula where time coagulates like honey. Stars burst into supernovae at the pace of blooming lilies, their light stretching into taffy ribbons of gold and violet that wrap around my limbs. Beneath me, an infinite library materializes – bookshelves made of fossilized music notes curve into Möbius strips, their pages whispering forgotten languages that taste of burnt sage and lightning. My fingertips brush a spine, and suddenly I’m witnessing the birth of a planet from the perspective of its first raindrop. Centuries condense into breaths. I inhale Atlantis’s final sigh; exhale meteor showers that seed new constellations shaped like wound-up secrets. A clockwork octopus emerges, gears clicking in reverse, offering me a key made of compressed silence. When I grasp it, everything accelerates and decays — mountains crumble to sand castles, civilizations unravel into yarn. Yet within the collapse, I feel galaxies knitting themselves anew inside my marrow, each cell a pocket universe where time dances barefoot, unshackled, delirious with possibility.
