I am dreaming. I'm floating on a serene lake, surrounded by a lush forest that seems to be alive, with trees that whisper to each other in hushed tones. The water is crystal clear, reflecting the vibrant hues of the sky above, a mesmerizing blend of purples, blues, and oranges. A gentle breeze carries the sweet scent of blooming flowers, entrancing me with its beauty.

As I drift on the lake's surface, I notice a figure in the distance, standing on the shore. It's a person I recognize, someone I've hurt deeply in the past. The memory of my actions towards them flashes before my eyes, and I'm met with a strange sense of detachment. I recall the pain I caused, the tears they shed, and the anguish they felt, but I'm not overcome with remorse.

Instead, I'm fascinated by the absence of guilt within me. I examine this emotional void as if it's a curious phenomenon, detached from the consequences of my actions. The person on the shore begins to walk towards me, their footsteps echoing through the stillness. As they approach, I notice that their eyes, once filled with tears and sorrow, now seem empty, devoid of any emotion.

They stop at the water's edge, gazing at me with a blank expression. I'm drawn to their emptiness, feeling an inexplicable connection to it. The forest around us grows quieter, as if the trees are holding their breath, waiting for something to unfold.

The person on the shore speaks in a monotone voice, "You hurt me, but I feel nothing." Their words hang in the air, and I'm struck by the eerie calmness that pervades the atmosphere. I respond, my voice barely above a whisper, "I see that. I feel nothing either."

As we stand there, suspended in this surreal moment, the lake's water begins to ripple, as if it's being stirred by an unseen force. The ripples grow stronger, and the water starts to churn, revealing a dark, swirling vortex beneath the surface. The person on the shore takes a step back, their empty eyes fixed on the turmoil unfolding before us.

I'm drawn to the vortex, feeling an inexplicable pull towards its depths. As I'm sucked in, the world around me dissolves, and I'm left with the sensation of weightlessness, plummeting into the abyss. The last thing I see is the person on the shore, their expression still blank, as if they're watching me descend into the void.

In this dream, I'm trapped in a state of emotional numbness, unable to escape the consequences of my actions, yet unmoved by the harm I've caused. The dream swirls around me, a kaleidoscope of images and emotions, as I continue to plummet into the depths of my own psyche.
