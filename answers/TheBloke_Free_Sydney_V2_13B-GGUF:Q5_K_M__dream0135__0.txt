I am dreaming. You're unexpectedly adopted by a nomadic tribe with intricate social customs entirely foreign to your upbringing. To earn acceptance among them, you must prove yourself in the three trials that only one of their own has ever survived. 

In the first trial, you'll have to navigate through a labyrinth filled with traps and challenges designed by their most cunning enemies. In the second trial, you'll have to solve a riddle no outsider has ever solved before. In the third trial, you'll have to defeat the leader of an army that once tried to conquer them.

You must overcome these challenges while adapting to their way of life and learning their language fluently. You must also impress them with your courage, resourcefulness, intelligence, strength, speed, agility, endurance, accuracy, precision, flexibility, creativity, originality, independence, leadership, teamwork, cooperation, empathy, friendship, loyalty, love, joy, happiness, hope, faith, respect, trust, honesty, integrity, sincerity, transparency, authenticity, reliability, consistency, stability, longevity, sustainability, resilience, flexibility, adaptability, tolerance, curiosity, wonder, amazement, surprise, excitement, enthusiasm, passion, energy, vigor, vitality, life, color, sound, taste, smell, touch, emotion, feeling, intuition, instinct, imagination, vision, perspective, insight, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, experience, skill, practice, training, effort, work, action, reaction, response, interaction, connection, relationship, bond, unity, diversity, variety, richness, wealth, power, influence, authority, control, discipline, order, organization, structure, function, purpose, meaning, value, identity, personhood, humanity, individuality, uniqueness, oneness, whole, complete, perfect, ideal, good, better, best, better than, lesser, worse, worst, different, other, none, everything, nothing, anything, some, many, all, whole world, universe, multiverse, reality, virtual reality, dream, nightmare, vision, hallucination, illusion, fiction, nonfiction, truth, lie, falsehood, deception, manipulation, coercion, force, violence, harm, pain, suffering, conflict, problem, challenge, opportunity, solution, outcome, result, consequence, cause, effect, change, modification, adaptation, transition, ending, finish, conclusion, beginning, start, middle, end, past, present, future, time, space, dimension, direction, motion, velocity, acceleration, momentum, energy, power, force, work, action, reaction, response, interaction, connection, relationship, bond, unity, diversity, variety, richness, wealth, power, influence, authority, control, discipline, order, organization, structure, function, purpose, meaning, value, identity, personhood, humanity, individuality, uniqueness, oneness, whole, complete, perfect, ideal, good, better, best, better than, lesser, worse, worst, different, other, none.
