I am dreaming. The subconscious mind is a vast, uncharted ocean, swirling with symbols, emotions, and latent desires. Let me take you through a dream that unfolds like a tapestry woven from unresolved feelings and unspoken truths. 

The dream begins in a place that feels both familiar and alien—a forest that exists outside of time.  The trees are not ordinary trees; they are archetypal, like something from a myth I've forgotten.  Their trunks are ribbons of sunlight, coiling and uncoiling like serpents.  The leaves are fragments of stained glass, each one reflecting a different memory: a childhood laughter, a first kiss, a moment of grief.  They don't rustle when the wind blows; they hum, a low, resonant sound that vibrates through the air like the cello in a storm.  I notice that the ground is not soil but a shifting mosaic of photos.  Some are autographed concert tickets, others are newspaper clippings with headlines that fade in and out—“City Council Votes to Bulldoze Park” flashed briefly before dissolving into static, thening into “Teen Saves Stranded Dolphin.”  The patterns in the photos seem to be leading me somewhere.  I follow them.  They form a path.

The path leads to a clearing.  At the center of the clearing is a house.  It's not a house I recognize, but I know it’s mine.  Except the house is not made of wood or brick.  It's constructed entirely from old letters.  They’re letters I’ve written, yes, but they’re also letters I’ve received.  Each window is a postcard, crinkled and yellowed, with a message in faded ink: “Can’t believe you’re moving to Paris!”; “I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t have said that.”  The front door is a letter from my grandmother, written in looping cursive that I can no longer read, the ink smudged by generations of hands.  I want to open the door, but I don’t know if I should.  The letters are fragile.  They’re crumbling at the edges, and some of the envelopes are already torn.  I feel a tug in my chest.  There’s something inside I need to see, but what if I destroy it?

I step closer.  My hand hovers over the handle.  That’s when I realize the house is alive.  The letters are moving.  The words are shifting, rearranging themselves like living organisms.  A sentence on the porch steps turns from “I love you” to “I hate you.”  The postcard in a window changes from a birthday wish to a funeral notice.  Everything is in flux.  I need to choose a moment before it changes again.  I choose the letter on the door.  The cursive grandmother.  Before I can even attempt to open it, the ink begins to bleed.  It glistens like black oil, creeping up the envelope, soaking through the paper.  I feel a stab of panic.  What if this is a bad omen?  But then I remember my grandmother’s voice: “Everything is temporary.”  I press the envelope to my forehead.  It’s warm.  It feels like her.  The ink doesn’t hurt.  I open it slowly.  The letter is torn at the top.  It reads:

Darling,

I’m not trying to hold you back.  Please don’t think I am.  Paris is beautiful.  I’ve been there.  The Seine is a necklace of light.  But you know what I miss most?  Your mother’s laugh.  Your father’s stubbornness.  You.  You’re special, not because you’re my granddaughter, but because you’re you.

I know you’re sad I’m not coming.  I’m not ready.  I need to stay here for a while.  But don’t wait for me.  Life is too short.  Go and live.

Love,

Gram

The last line is bleeding into the next.  “Love” turns into “Love you,” then “Love you forever,” before dissolving entirely.  I fold the letter back into its envelope.  It stops bleeding.  It’s just a letter again.  But when I touch it, I can still feel her.  I slip it into my pocket.

Now, I need to decide what to do next.  The clearing is empty except for the house and the path.  The path leads back to the forest.  But something is different.  The photos on the ground are moving.  They’re forming new patterns.  One of the photos is a self-portrait I painted last year.  I remember the day I painted it.  I was feeling lost, trying to figure out my next step.  The painting shows me standing on a cliff, looking out at an ocean that’s both calm and stormy.  In the dream, the painting is changing.  The ocean is now a highway.  I’m not standing on a cliff; I’m driving a car.  My reflection in the rearview mirror is smiling, but it’s not me.  It’s someone else.  I don’t recognize them.

I follow the path again, but this time it leads to a different clearing.  This one is filled with water.  The water is a shimmering, liquid tapestry, each drop a different color: blues, greens, yellows.  They’re not just colors; they’re emotions.  I can feel them.  A splash of crimson is anger.  A ripple of lavender is longing.  I dip my hand into the water.  The colors soak into my skin.  I feel a rush of joy, then a pang of sorrow.  The water is a mirror.  It’s reflecting me back.  But it’s not my face I see.  It’s a silhouette, a shadow of a person.  A woman, maybe.  She’s reaching out to me.  I want to reach back, but my arm is made of water too.  I can’t touch her.  She’s too far away. But I can’t leave her.  She’s me.  She’s me in a form I can’t yet see.

I wake up with a gasp, my heart pounding, my sheets damp with sweat.  The sunlight is filtering through the curtains, but the dream feels as real as this moment.  I sit up, my hands shaking.  I need to write this down before it fades.  But as I reach for the pen, I realize: the letter is still in my pocket.
