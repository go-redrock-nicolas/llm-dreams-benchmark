I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt honey and static, as if the sky itself has been scorched by a thousand forgotten suns. I stand in a labyrinth of glass corridors that stretch infinitely, each wall reflecting fractured versions of myself—some laughing, some weeping, some with eyes hollowed out by time. The floor beneath my bare feet shimmers like liquid mercury, and every step sends ripples through the reflections, distorting faces into grotesque masks. Somewhere, a clock ticks backward, its hands dripping black oil that pools into the shapes of closed doors.  

A shadow moves at the edge of my vision. It’s *Him*—or *Her*. Or all of them. The figure shifts like smoke, morphing between lovers I’ve known: the one who left me in a hotel room at dawn, the one who carved promises into my skin with a knife of sweet lies, the one whose silence drowned me. Their eyes are hollow but glowing, twin voids that pull at my ribs like hooks. I feel the old pull, a magnetic ache in my chest, even as my mind screams, *Not again. Not again.*  

The labyrinth collapses.  

I fall into a forest of petrified trees, their branches clawing at a sky stitched with constellations that spell out my name in a language I’ve forgotten. The ground is littered with letters I never sent, pages curling into ash. A river cuts through the woods, but the water is made of shattered mirrors, each shard holding a memory: a kiss under fireworks, a fist slammed into a wall, a whispered “I’ll change” that dissolved like sugar in rain.  

The shadow catches me, wrapping around me like a lover’s arm. Its voice is velvet rot, a chorus of all the ones I’ve loved and lost: *“You need this. You crave the storm. Without me, you’re nothing but an empty room.”* I want to resist, but my hands betray me—they reach for the shadow, tracing its edges as if it’s a map to my own soul.  

Then, a scream tears through the air. Not mine. A child’s.  

I turn, and there she is: a girl with my childhood eyes, her dress soaked in ink. She’s holding a cracked mirror, pointing it at me. In the glass, I see the pattern laid bare—a serpent eating its own tail, a carousel spinning faster and faster, always ending where it began. The girl sobs, “*You keep building cages out of your fear. Break it. Break it.*”  

The shadow hisses, unraveling like thread pulled from a fraying sweater. The forest trembles. I grab a shard of mirror from the river and press it to my chest. The glass doesn’t cut—it *burns*, etching a new shape into my skin: a spiral, not a circle. The shadow screeches, its form dissolving into moths that flutter toward the petrified trees.  

The girl smiles, fading into mist. “*The labyrinth was never real. You were just afraid to walk through the fire.*”  

The dream fractures.  

I wake up gasping, my sheets soaked in sweat, the taste of burnt honey on my tongue. But in the corner of the room, a single moth circles the lightbulb, and for a heartbeat, I swear its wings shimmer like broken glass.
