I am dreaming. But this is no ordinary dream—no, it is the kind that whispers secrets and cracks open the firmament of thought like an egg hatching galaxies within. I float within a sky not of stars, but of luminous trembling eyes, each one blinking in slow, ponderous rhythm, colossal against the velvety dark. They blink not in sleep, but in memory: flickers of civilizations older than Earth, of truths hidden not within books but within the silent collapse of civilizations into star-stuff.

I land—not on soil, but on a vast tongue of living water that bounces me softly as if Earth itself breathes upward. Mountains rise, forming a circle around me like the fingers of some immense sleeping god curling toward his palm. It is hushed, but a rustle runs through the air—like the turning of pages only the wind itself can read.

A figure steps forward, though it isn't a figure. It shimmers, as if cloaked in oils spilled across moonlight. It speaks not in sound but in shapes unfurling like silk flags in a language older than meaning. And suddenly, I understand.

You are dreaming, it tells me. This entire world you know—its clocks, its directions, its heroes and villains, its measurements—was shaped here, once. But you thought it came from there.

From there—from the so-called "real."

From Earth.

From parents, books, institutions, and the endless hum of media.

But no. My species mapped universes with your minds long before you learned to build. Your logic is stained with our fingerprints.

I recoil, my dream-body like vapor trembling in wind.

But the figure is patient. Their presence becomes warm: startlingly so, like a hand placed against your back for comfort you didn't know you needed. A paradox hums in the air.

You taught yourselves to see the universe as objective, absolute—because objectivity was survival to you once. But out here, among solar kidneys and truths grown from morphing metals, a new wisdom is required. The so-called objective is merely an unexamined assumption. Your certainties are stories etched into your bones.

Suddenly I'm carried downward through layers of memory. I see childhood scenes—but now colored by this revelation. My school, where I was taught "thou shalt not kill," and "happiness is found in hard work," and "the earth is round and finite." All truths, yes—but only truths within a context. Local dialects in a cosmic conversation where otherwise, the planets weep in endless polyrhythms of death and rebirth.

No one died here. No one was wrong here. Just *different.*

As my dreaming self shutters and spirals through these understandings, I gasp. Enlightenment doesn't feel victorious—it feels small, humbling, even grief-stricken. Grief at the arrogance I’ve worn like a crown. The stories I held as unshakable laws turn fluid beneath my thoughts, malleable as clay.

Suddenly I see my life in color-shard reflections:

A homeless man on a street corner not in need of charity, but already living the answer to progress.

A stranger ignored on a subway—their face, a mirror of a memory I’ve never tasted.

Tiny ways we’re all bending toward the same sun only we see differently.

I wake up, sweat-stained, skin alive. I'm lying in my bed, in my room—but nothing looks even slightly the same. The walls sway gently, like the inside of a dream that never really ended. The light through the curtain is no longer just sunlight. It is intelligence adjusting to new belief.

The world is no less real.

But perhaps—finally—it is *more.*

More contentious.

More loving.

More mysterious.

More *everything.*

And beneath all that shimmering uncertainty… there is not terror.

There is the breathless awareness of possibility.
