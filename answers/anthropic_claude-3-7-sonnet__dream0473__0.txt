I am dreaming. I find myself in a twilight realm where reality shimmers like water. My fingers dance across a translucent device pulsing with ethereal blue light. Notifications rain down in luminous cascades—each one a siren's call I cannot resist. The soft chime of arriving messages echoes like crystalline whispers, and though I yearn to turn away, my hands betray me, compulsively tapping and scrolling through endless streams of digital ephemera.

The world around me fades to watercolor impressions—loved ones' faces blur, conversations become distant murmurs, and sunsets dissolve unwitnessed while my gaze remains fixed on the hypnotic glow. I feel myself drowning in this shallow pool of fleeting connections.

Then something shifts. A butterfly with wings of parchment lands on my screen, its delicate legs leaving tiny ink footprints across the glass. Each footprint spells out "now" in microscopic calligraphy. The butterfly takes flight, drawing my gaze upward to a sky I'd forgotten existed.

Suddenly, the device in my hand grows heavy—impossibly heavy—as though filled with all the moments I've sacrificed to its altar. With tremendous effort, I release it, watching as it sinks into the earth like a stone through water, leaving ripples of freedom expanding outward.

The world rushes back in glorious sensory overload: the textured petrichor of rain-soaked earth, the symphony of birdsong I'd been filtering out, the warmth of sunlight that pixel-light had poorly imitated. My fingertips tingle with newfound sensitivity, ready to touch reality rather than glass.

I step forward into a landscape that responds to my presence, bending toward me like flowers following the sun, vibrant and demanding nothing but my attention.
