I am dreaming. I see myself standing in a beautiful garden full of flowers and fruits.  The air is sweet and fragrant.  The sun shines brightly overhead.  I feel happy and contented.
Then, suddenly, I realize that I can easily manipulate others by exploiting their weaknesses, giving me significant power over them. With this realization about my ability to control people, I
decide to test it out on the first person I see.
I look around and spot a man walking toward me from the path.  He is tall and handsome with dark hair and blue eyes.  He is wearing a white shirt and gray pants.  He looks curious and confused as he approaches me.
"Hello," he says, "who are you?"
I smile at him and say, "My name is Alice."
He frowns at me and says, "That's not your real name.  That's the name of a character in a book."
