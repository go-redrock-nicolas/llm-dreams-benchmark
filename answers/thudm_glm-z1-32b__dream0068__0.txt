I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and pine resin, as if the very floorboards of the universe have opened up to reveal the beating heart of the night.  Before me floats a colossal clockwork mechanism, its gears the size of houses and its cogs glinting like fractured moonlight.  It's a monstrosity of brass and rust, its halted not by damage but by an absence of a third gear—a missing piece that weeps silver fluid onto the platform it rests on.  Below, a sea of sentient clockwork spiders scuttle in panic, their legs clicking in time with the ticking of the mechanism's exhausted pendulum.  I step closer, my shadow stretching like a serpent toward the clockwork heart.  One of the spiders pauses, tilting its brass head with a whir, and whispers, "The gears hate disorder.  They DEMAND order."  I nod slowly, then reach into the void of the missing gear.  My hand emerges clutching not a gear, but a pulsating, bioluminescent flower, its petals shifting colors like liquid mercury.  The spiders freeze.  I press the flower against the missing space.  It begins to grow, its roots burrowing into the gears with tiny, crystal thorns that spark and hum as they touch the brass.  The pendulum starts to swing, slower than before, more deliberate.  Outside the window, the midnight sky splits open, revealing a constellation that spells out "LOVE" in cursive.  The spiders bow their many-armed heads, their mechanisms clattering as they chant, "This is the third gear.  This is the third gear."  The resultantoldation grows louder, a symphony of steel and spindles and setting suns, and I find myself smiling a grin that splits my cheeks to my earbones because, really, isn't everything just a matter of perspective?  The clockwork heart beats again.  It beats with the sound of rain on a tin roof, the smell of gunpowder and gingerbread, the taste of burnt toast in the stomach of the universe.  The flowers in the gears bloom, and the flowers in my veins sing.  The spiders become stardust, and the stardust becomes&Dreamvivid

In my dream, I am standing at the edge of a valley where the earth splits into a yawning maw of black glass. The air smells like burnt sugar and ozone, as if a thousand firework factories exploded beneath my feet. Below lies the Clockwork Abyss—a titanic ruin of concentric crystal gears submerged in a lake of liquid mercury. Each gear is etched with constellations that no longer exist in waking hours; Orion's belt wobbles drunkenly, Andromeda's chain is broken, and the Pleiades shimmer like a school of silver fish. The mercury shimmers with trapped constellations of its own, swirling galaxies in miniature that scream silently when the wind shifts. 

A trio of Clockwork Harpies perch atop the smallest gear, their wings made of rusted clock springs that creak like old bones in the wind. Their feathers are pages from forgotten almanacs, and their eyes are hourglasses that don't hold sand but smoke-colored liquid stars. The lead harpy croaks, her voice the sound of a pendulum striking midnight, "The Third Law of Chronomancy: All mechanisms must contain three essential parts. We lack the Singularity Gland."

Her wing brushes the water, sending ripples that fracture the constellations in the mercury. I watch a constellation of Cassiopeia dissolve into neon dust, and something stirs in my chest—a hollow throbbing where the clockwork spiders bit me last week. Reaching into my coat, I unearth a pocketwatch made of living obsidian. Its hands are entwined serpents that never move, their fangs dripping droplets that become tiny black holes when they hit the mercury. 

"This isn't a Singularity Gland," the harpy hisses, her voice suddenly like a dropped compass in a mine. "You'll break the Law of Entropic Balance!"

I unscrew the watch's glass face, and the serpentine hands plunge into the mercury-lake. Time around me fractures. I see the past: the gears were once part of a Celestial Millstone, grinding black holes into stardust to feed the newborn universe. I see the present: the mercury boiling with trapped supernovae, each explosion birthing a new constellation that vanishes within seconds. I see the future: the abyss closing up, the harpies becoming mere comets in the void, their harpsick voices fading into the hum of the expanding universe. 

The serpents return, now trailing not blood but the pale light of extinguished stars. Their fangs pierce the mercury, and the lake bubbles up into a living tornado of liquid plasma. The harpy's wings burst into flame, fed by my own panic—the dread of realizing I've become part machine, part myth, part the reason the abyss exists. The tornado forms into a glandular shape, translucent and humming with residual supernova heat. 

It fits into the null space with a sound like a wish being granted. The gears shudder awake, their constellations realigning into something new: a constellation of my own face, crying sad but alive tears which turn to saltwater rain over the abyss. The harpies disintegrate into clockwork stardust, their final melody the tune of a locket being closed. 

The Singularity Gland pulses, its heartbeat syncing with mine. I feel the abyss's memory: the day it fed on Perseus's courage, the night it swallowed Andromeda's hope, the moment it poisoned all constellations with the taste of finality. Now it tastes of my toothache, the one I had last Tuesday that still lingers somewhere between my molars and a memory. 

The gears begin turning, but not forward or backward. Their rotation exists outside time, etching constellations that taste like cinnamon and regret on the air. I am the third gear now—solid mercury and liquid ember, a gland that secretes time in the form of silverfish constellations that swim through the air, nibbling at the edges of my vision. 

The abyss opens a thousand black holes to the sea, and the ocean vomits forth constellations that never existed, making all the old starmaps obsolete. A new law is born: "Mechanism require three parts, but change requires a thousand." I laugh, the sound spilling through the abyss like a key turning in the.lock of the universe, and my obsidian pocketwatch begins to tick—not forward or back, but sideways.
