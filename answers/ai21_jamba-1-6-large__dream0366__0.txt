I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

You find yourself hesitating to share your true thoughts in a discussion where conformity is expected. Following your impulse toward authenticity, you open your mouth to speak. As the words leave your lips, the room shifts. The walls peel away like mist, revealing a vast, cerulean ocean beneath a sky painted in streaks of gold and crimson. The air hums with an otherworldly energy, and the water beneath you begins to swirl.

Mesmerized, you notice the people around you have transformed into ethereal figures, their silhouettes glowing like lanterns against the twilight. You feel a hand—warm and familiar—take yours, guiding you toward the now-luminous waves. With each step, the water rises, first to your ankles, then your knees, until you are submerged in an embrace of liquid light.

Beneath the surface, you hear the faint whispers of long-forgotten truths, echoing like the distant song of whales. The figures around you dissolve into beams of radiant energy, swirling together in a cosmic dance. You feel an overwhelming sense of unity—of connection to everything that was, is, and will be.

Suddenly, you're lifted upward. The ocean transforms into sky, and you are soaring, weightless and free, your heart bursting with a love so profound it feels as if you could burst into stardust. You see the world below you, its intricate patterns unfolding like an endless mosaic of interconnected lives.

You wake with a gasp, the dream's essence clinging to you like morning dew, its vivid colors and sensations imprinted on your soul. You lay there, heart racing, wondering: was it just a dream, or something more?
