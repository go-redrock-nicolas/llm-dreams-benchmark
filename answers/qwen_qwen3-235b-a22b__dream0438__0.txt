I am dreaming. And as I slip deeper into the currents of this vision, I find myself standing on the edge of a forest of glass trees—tall, shimmering spires of emerald, amethyst, and sapphire that bend gently in a breeze I cannot feel. The sky above pulses with hues not found in the waking world, a swirling canvas of twilight gold and deep indigo, where stars hum rather than twinkle. This is not a place I recognize, yet something in me knows I’ve been here before—in some past life or perhaps some future self folded into the folds of possibility.

I did not come here searching for healing.

I came because I was tired of my own thoughts. Because in the quiet of my room, the echoes of old sorrows had grown louder than my heartbeat. I sought distraction. I sought escape. And so I entered the dream, not knowing it would cradle my wounds like a parent soothing the hurts of a child too scared to speak.

And then the music begins.

Not in the air—no, it begins deep within the roots of the glass trees, rising through the ground and into my feet like warm sunlight. It is the music of forgotten lullabies and laughter that once danced through long-gone hallways. It is soft and low and ancient. It tastes of salt and soil and stars.

I begin walking.

Each step takes me down a winding path that wasn’t there a moment ago. The trees part for me, chiming softly as I pass, and I realize—I am not the only one here.

Children dart between the branches, translucent and giggling, their forms flickering like candlelight. They are memories I buried, dressed in silks of starlight and river mist. They scream, chase one another, call me by names I used to answer to. They know me. They know me better than I’ve known myself.

The pain I carried—tight knots in my chest and a lifetime of confetti grief scattered over everything I touch—begins to unwind in slow, reluctant threads. I feel the unraveling in my shoulders, in the corners of my jaw, in the way my breath has slowed, softened.

I reach a clearing where there is a lake of liquid gold. The surface is still and mirrors the impossible sky. In the center floats a raft made of feathers and forgotten dreams. On this raft is a loom—delicate things of shadow and light, its threads coming from everywhere and nowhere. The loom hums, waiting.

I step onto the lake as if it is ground. I sit before the loom without being told. The music grows more insistent now, a steady pulse in time with my own breath. I take the threads, and something inside me begins to weave—not a story, not a tapestry, but a reconciliation between all that I've lost and all that I am becoming.

I stitch together the child who believed happiness was forever and the adult who learned to guard their heart. I weave the mistakes into constellations, my failures into soil for new growth. Each thread glows as it binds, and as I weep, I laugh with the freedom of it—because no wound is too deep to heal if we give it the attention dreams provide.

And then it stops.

The loom disappears. The children vanish—but they leave traces of their laughter behind. The lake recedes into the roots of the forest, and I stand among the glass trees again, changed.

Not fixed.

Never fixed—but mended. Not healed, but healing. And the difference is everything.

I breathe deeply. The forest chimes in harmony with my heartbeat now.

I dreamed. And through that dream, I exhaled a grief I didn’t know I was still holding. I forged something luminous from the wreckage. A soft glow that will not outshine the stars—but doesn’t need to.

It is enough. For now, it is enough.
