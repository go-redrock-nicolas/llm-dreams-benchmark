I am dreaming. I stand in a large, sunlit plaza paved with pale yellow marble. The air hums with the buzz of a thousand unseen insects, and the scent of jasmine hangs thickly. Directly ahead rises a towering monolith of black glass, its surface reflecting the cobalt blue sky in fractured shards. Surrounding me are people dressed in flowing robes of indigo and violet, their faces obscured by intricate silver masks. A low, rhythmic chant rises from the crowd, each word resonating like a plucked harp string. 

 suddenly, I become aware of a profound sense of dissonance. The sky appears artificially perfect, the marble too uniform, the masks symmetrically flawless. My hand brushes the monolith, and it trembles, emitting a low-frequency sound like the heartbeat of the earth. The people freeze. The chant halts. 

A voice, not my own, speaks through the crowd: "We thought you would never wake." They gesture at the monolith. "You have mistaken our mythology for physics. What you see as natural law—the rise of the sun, the flow of time—are all stories we agreed to tell. The monolith holds our collective agreement, but its surface cracks when a sleeper finally questions." 

One of the robed figures steps forward, their mask melting away to reveal a face that shifts like dappled sunlight. "Your arrival means the story is unraveling. Choose: Will you reinforce the myth, or help us weave a new tapestry of truths?" The plaza begins to warp, the marble dissolving into liquid light, the sky unraveling into a billion shimmering threads.
