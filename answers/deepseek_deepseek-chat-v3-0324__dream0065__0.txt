I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Shattered Path**  

I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, broken landscape—a world suspended between ruin and possibility. The sky is a stormy violet, streaked with veins of liquid gold where the clouds split apart. Beneath my feet, the ground is made of shattered glass, each piece reflecting a different version of myself—some triumphant, some weeping, some barely holding on.  

Ahead of me, the path forks—not into two clean roads, but into infinite fractures, splintering like lightning across the sky. Each branch hums with a different fate, vibrating with whispers: *"Turn back."* *"You’re lost."* *"What if you fall again?"* But beneath them, deeper still, is something else—a low, resonant pulse, like the earth itself breathing.  

Then, I see them—shadows of my past failures emerging from the cracks. They take form: a collapsed tower of scattered ambitions, a bridge half-finished and crumbled, a shipwreck of abandoned dreams rusting in an ocean of could-have-beens. But as they rise, something strange happens—the glass beneath me begins to *move*. The shards shift like living things, rearranging themselves into something new.  

One fragment glows brighter than the others. When I step onto it, the world tilts. Suddenly, I am no longer standing—I am *falling upward*, into a sky that splits open like a ripe pomegranate, spilling out stars. And for the first time, the failures don’t feel like endings—they feel like constellations, mapping a route I could never have seen from solid ground.  

A voice, neither kind nor cruel, but *true*, whispers:  

*"There are no wrong turns—only broken paths waiting to be remade."*  

Then—I wake. Or do I merely step into the next dream?
