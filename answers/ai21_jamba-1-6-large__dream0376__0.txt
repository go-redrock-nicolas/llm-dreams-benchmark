I am dreaming. In the stillness of a moonlit night, I find myself standing at the intersection of a bustling street and an alleyway called Salvation. The air is thick with the scent of rust and gunmetal, punctuated by faint whispers of broken glass. The neon signs above flicker with an erratic pulse, casting fractured shadows on the pavement like ghosts of a forgotten past. The world around me hums in discordant harmony, a symphony of distant sirens, aching concrete, and whispered prayers that echo off of cracked glass.

My ribs ache from where I was recent attacked by someone for blowing the whistle. The wounds throb beneath a patchwork of dirty bandages, throbbing with each breath, each step. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, beating in time with the distant rhythmic pounding of pounding in the earth. Shadows grow long and distorted in this place, twisting themselves into misshapen phantoms that seem to mock me, taunt me as they writhe across the walls of salvage yards and burned-out cars.

But there's no time to dwell on my injuries. I push through the pain and step into the glowing green glow of the alley. My boots are soaked in the oily residue of rainwater mixed with sewage and motor oil; they make a sick slurping sound with each step like they're dragging me into towards the darkness. My hands tremble faintly, but my grip on the paper coffee cup in one hand and the letter in the other remains steady, cold, unyielding. 

I walk past the tattered remains of an old bus bench, worn down to spikes of rusted metal and wood. The rust bleeds into my palm as I take my seat, feeling the cold cuts seeping through the thin fabric of my coat. Across from me is an apartment building whose windows look like the gaping mouths of the damned. The billboards surrounding it advertise salvation, redemption, and hope in bold red letters, neon lights flickering ominously against the inky-blue backdrop of the night sky. 

In the corner of my eye, I see movement in the shadows. A man steps into the pale light of a flickering streetlamp – he’s wearing a long trench coat stained with oil and dirt. His unkempt beard hides his face and shadows cling to him like a second skin. He watches me with eyes like smoldering coals, those dark pools burn with a ferocity that speaks of unspoken threats and lurking menace. I can taste the hazard of what he represents on my tongue, the metallic tinge of fear mingling with the exhaust fumes and the faint tang of discarded alcohol.

I let him come closer, each step he takes towards me seems to echo through the alley, the sound crashing against the walls of my skull. He stops a foot away from me and tilts his head, his unkempt hair obscuring one eye as he sizes me up like a predator cornering prey. The moment stretches unbearably long, filled with a tension that could snap at any second. Without warning, the ground beneath us rumbles and shifts violently, sending tremors through the foundations of this urban hellscape. I hear the sound of crumbling stones and debris as the very earth begins to tear itself apart around us outside the confines of this moment. He smirks in a way that chills my bones, and then he lunges at me with a violence that's both primal and deliberate. 

I feel the rush of adrenaline coursing through my veins as I slide the letter into the pocket of my coat. My hand lashes out in an instant, the sudden ferocity catching him off guard. I slam the sharp edge of an old coffee cup straight into his face, shattering it on impact. Blood mixes with the viscous liquid as I watch his features twist in pain and surprise, a shocked cry muffled by the dull roar that begins to fill my ears. 

The letter burns in my pocket like a live wire leading to my fate, and so I turn back towards the shadows as the ground cracks beneath me. Panic surges through my chest as everything around me begins to collapse into something more visceral and threatening. I can hear the people in the streets screaming for help and it all fades away as I turn back to the alley's entrance, where salvation is both within reach and slipping through my fingers like the faint remnants of a forgotten dream.
