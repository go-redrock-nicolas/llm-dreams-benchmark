I am dreaming. You are dreaming. In the pale glow of a moon that shifts color with every blink, you feel an unspoken summons tugging at your heart. Following this inner guidance, you step off a field of silver grass and onto a narrow path of luminescent steppingstones. Each stone pulses beneath your foot, as if it remembers your name.

With every step the air grows warmer, fragrant with nightblooming orchids whose petals open to reveal tiny galaxies swirling at their centers. You reach out and touch one: it shivers, and a soft voice echoes in your mind, “Trust the compass within.” Beneath your palm, the ground ripples like water, and from it rises a slender column of light. At its summit hovers a crystalline compass, its needle spinning until it finally points straight ahead.

You follow the needle through a thicket of ghostly trees whose branches intertwine overhead, forming a living cathedral. Strange birds woven of stardust glide between the boughs, trailing ribbons of song that wrap themselves around your ribs, filling you with certainty. The forest parts to reveal a vast ocean of mist—only here, the mist is alive, drifting like silken fish, each one carrying a glint of your untold potential.

Stepping onto a small wooden boat that appears at your feet, you let the mistfish swirl around you as you drift toward a distant island crowned by a single, monumental tree. Its trunk is carved with symbols you do not consciously understand but know, in every cell, to be your truth. As you draw nearer, the compass in your hand dissolves into motes of light that rise to join the tree’s bioluminescent blossoms.

Beneath that tree you kneel and press your palm to the bark. A warmth spreads through you, and in a single, crystalline moment you perceive the direction you must follow in waking life—an invitation to share your own light, to guide others through their darkness. The branches arch above you like welcoming arms, and the blossoms rain down gentle sparks, planting seeds of purpose in your soul.

Then, as dawn’s first breath filters through your eyelids, you awaken—heart pounding, blood humming with promise, and in your hand the faintest imprint of a starry petal.
