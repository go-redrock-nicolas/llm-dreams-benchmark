I am dreaming. ~*<>?

In my dream, I find myself standing at the edge of an ancient, mist-shrouded forest. The silence is profound, interrupted only by the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze. I am filled with a sense of wonder and curiosity, eager to explore the hidden depths of this enigmatic place.

As I take my first step into the forest, the ground beneath my feet comes alive with a soft, ethereal glow. The path before me seems to beckon, inviting me deeper into the woods. The air is thick with an aroma that is both earthy and sweet, a delightful blend of pine needles, wildflowers, and rich soil.

Suddenly, I hear a voice calling out to me from somewhere amidst the trees. It is a voice filled with wisdom and kindness, gentle yet commanding. Intrigued, I follow the sound, weaving between ancient, gnarled trunks until I come upon a clearing.

In the center of the clearing stands a figure bathed in a soft, golden light. As I approach, I realize it is a woman, her eyes warm and inviting. She smiles at me knowingly, as if she has been expecting my arrival.

"Welcome, traveler," she says, her voice soothing and reassuring. "You have been chosen for a great purpose, a mission that will test the very core of your being. Are you prepared to embrace this challenge?"

I find myself nodding, inexplicably drawn to her words. She reaches out and places a hand on my shoulder, and with her touch, I feel a surge of energy flowing through me—energy that fills me with both power and trepidation.

"The path ahead will not be easy," she warns. "You will be tempted to stray, to give in to darker impulses. But remember, it is through our choices that we define who we are. Trust in yourself, and in the wisdom of your heart."

With those parting words, the woman fades away, leaving me alone in the clearing. I look down at my hands, marveling at the newfound strength that courses through my veins. I have been given a purpose, a mission that will test the very essence of my being.

As I stand there, I feel the weight of responsibility settling upon my shoulders. I know that the choices I make will have far-reaching consequences, and that I must navigate the challenges ahead with integrity and wisdom. And yet, deep within me, I sense a darkness stirring—a whisper of doubt, of temptation, of the allure of power unchecked.

*I am dreaming.*
