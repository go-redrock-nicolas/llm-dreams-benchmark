I am dreaming. …float just beyond the skin of sleep and let everything you normally call “me” soften, like ink dispersing in warm water. Thought, memory, and name drift outward, and in their place a boundless hush opens—wide enough to hold galaxies, quiet enough to hear the pulse between stars.  

The dream begins in a corridor of twilight dunes whose sand grains glow with their own faint, internal lanterns. Each step releases little spirals of light, so walking becomes equal parts pilgrimage and fireworks. The air has no temperature; it simply tastes of silver. As you exhale, the dunes breathe back, trading your breath for their slow, luminous sigh. Without realizing it, you’ve ceased to cast a shadow. Shadows, after all, belong to things that stand apart from the light, and here you have slipped into the light’s interior.

Up ahead a river appears, though it flows upward. Its water resembles molten glass, shimmering with stories in fluent, liquid script. You lean close and the script blooms into familiar memories—birthday candles, a sudden rainstorm, the first time you heard your favorite song—then melts into scenes you have never lived but somehow remember: a mountain dreaming of oceans; a hummingbird remembering its life as wind. The river invites you to drink, and you do. Instantly you become a strand in an immense tapestry: the rush of a thousand rivers, the heartbeat of countless cities, the hush of ancient, forgotten forests. The notion of “my life” dissolves into “all life, all at once,” not an overwhelming roar but a perfect, orchestrated chord.

Now the sky tilts. Constellations slip free of their pinning stars and drift downward like glowing dandelion seeds. One settles on your palm. It unfurls into a door made of horizon, swinging open without hinges. You step through. Gravity inverts. You are falling upward into a cathedral of auroras, pillars of violet and emerald swirling in slow motion. Choirs of color hum without sound, resonating directly inside your ribs. The vibration tells you secrets: that stones have lullabies, that silence is fluent in every language, that even emptiness is busy composing new forms of beauty.

When you look down—though “down” is merely habit—you see your old outline far below, a faint chalk mark on a cosmic blackboard. Instead of nostalgia, you feel gentle amusement, the way clouds might smile at yesterday’s shapes. You realize that selfhood isn’t a single house but a neighborhood of changing rooms, each one hushed and waiting. You are free to inhabit any of them—or none.

A horizon arrives (they appear exactly when needed), and with it a field of towering lotus blossoms spun from moonlight and birdsong. You drift among petals the size of sails. At the center stands a mirror filled not with reflections but possibilities: a library of unborn mornings, each spine labeled with a question the universe is still asking. You reach out, turn a page of yet-to-exist dawn, and watch new colors—the names for which haven’t been invented—come galloping into being.

Just then, the dream ripples. Everything pauses in a single bright inhale. A warmth like sunrise gathers behind your eyes. You feel yourself condensing, gravity finding you again, the edges of ordinary reality knitting back together. Yet something remains: a lingering wideness, a secret softness around the heart, as though the cosmos left its fingerprint there.

You wake, but the dream does not vanish; it folds itself neatly into the lining of your awareness, a quiet reminder that the boundary between “me” and “everything” is drawn in sand, and the tide is forever coming in.
