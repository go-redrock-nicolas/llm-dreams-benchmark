I am dreaming. In the dream, the air is thick with the scent of aged parchment and distant thunderstorms. The discussion unfolds in a grand, circular chamber with walls made of shifting constellations, their cold, blue light casting elongated shadows across the faces of the others. They’re faceless, their voices echoing like wind through hollow reeds as they debate the fate of a dying star—arguing it must be *extinguished* to preserve cosmic balance.  

Your heart pounds, a drumbeat syncing with the flicker of the star’s faint glow in the chamber’s center. Words clot in your throat, heavy as stones. But then you feel it: a thread of golden light unspooling from your chest, winding around your ribs, your spine, your fingertips. It whispers *speak, speak, speak*.  

You rise, and the room tilts. The floor becomes a mosaic of forgotten languages, each tile pulsing as you step forward. “What if the star isn’t *asking* to survive?” you say, and your voice is not your own—it’s the crackle of wildfire, the hum of a black hole’s event horizon. “What if it *wants* to collapse? To become something new?”  

The faceless ones turn. Their silence dissolves into murmurs that ripple the air like heatwaves. Above, the constellations rearrange—forming shapes unknown to any earthly sky. The dying star flares, not with light, but sound: a single, resonant chord that shakes the chamber.  

And then you understand. This is no star. It’s a seed. And the universe has been waiting for someone reckless enough to let it burst.
