I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself standing at a crossroads illuminated by the soft glow of lanterns that flicker in the gentle breeze. The path ahead forks into three distinct directions: one leading to misty mountains shrouded in an ethereal fog, another plunging into a dense, ancient forest teeming with life, and the final route descending into a sparkling, crystalline cavern. As I stand there, uncertain of which path to take, I hear the faint, haunting melody of a lute being played somewhere in the distance, its notes weaving through the air like golden threads.
The ground beneath me begins to tremble, and I am suddenly enveloped by a warm, golden light. The light expands, enveloping me completely, and I feel as though I am being washed clean of all emotions, leaving me feeling refreshingly calm and composed. When the light recedes, I find myself truly unburdened, as if a heavy weight I didn't even know I was carrying has vanished.

I turn back to the crossroads, feeling a surge of clarity and confidence I hadn't expected. Without hesitation, I step towards the path that leads to the dense forest. The trees loom over me, their majestic trunks and branches forming a natural cathedral. As I walk deeper into the woods, I notice a reddish hue begin to bathe the surroundings, deepening as I move forward. The deeper I go, the more the colour transforms, becoming a rich, vibrant shade that transforms the entire forest into a magical, ethereal place.

I continue to walk, completely entranced by the shifting hues of the forest.
