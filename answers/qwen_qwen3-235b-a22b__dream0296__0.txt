I am dreaming. The surreal landscape around me shifts and ripples like a reflection on the surface of a disturbed pond.  I see my reflection in a shimmering pool before me, my face distorted and unfamiliar.  My rational mind tells me it's impossible, yet I feel both older and younger than I remember, adrift between memories and possibilities.  I am both observer and participant in this strange drama, grasping at a sense of self that slips through my fingers like smoke.  The ground beneath me feels solid yet unstable, like walking on memory foam.  I am comforted by the strangeness, yet deeply unsettled.  I long to wake, yet am compelled to understand.  I am lost in the dream, and in myself.
