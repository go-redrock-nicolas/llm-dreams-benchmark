I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a lush meadow, the sun subtly shining on the grass while magic air bubbles revolve around me. Then, all of a sudden, I'm floating in that wonderful meadow, carefree and unconcerned by anything or anybody, the surrounding air bulbs tossing off the leaning grass and my feet never ordinarily grasped with the grass. The situation inside my dream relinquishes all its gravity.
