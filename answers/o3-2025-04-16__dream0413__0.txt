I am dreaming. …I am dreaming.

The realization arrives like the faint toll of a hidden bell—soft, resonant, and strangely familiar. I stand on an endless, moon-polished pier that stretches over a sea the color of liquid obsidian. Above me, constellations swirl in slow spirals, threading themselves into translucent tapestries that whisper with starlight. The night tastes of salt and citrus, as if the universe itself has bitten into an orange and let the juice fall.

Without meaning to, I straighten my shoulders in the exact, elegant way my admired mentor does during public talks. Words spill from my mouth—eloquent, crisp, and measured—echoing their unmistakable cadence. My hands sketch shapes in the air, punctuating thoughts with the same graceful flourishes I have watched a hundred times. I’m both speaker and spectator, enraptured by my own performance, yet dimly unnerved by its borrowed choreography.

The pier begins to glow beneath my feet: planks of pear-wood bloom with shifting runes that pulse in rhythm with my heartbeat. Every rune is a syllable of the mentor’s name, repeating itself until the pier transforms into a luminous sentence. With each step forward, the pier rewrites, rearranges, questions itself—almost as if my borrowed language is weaving the ground I walk on.

Something changes in the distance. A figure forms out of the dark waters, rising as a pillar of mirrored glass. It hardens into a version of me—but taller, draped in my mentor’s signature silver-buttoned coat, face half-lit with wry confidence. As the wind lifts, the reflection and I speak simultaneously, our voices identical, syllables colliding in a strange duet:

“Acquire clarity—”  
“Refine the question—”  
“Let your silence guide the answer.”

I hear them, yet the sentences are not truly mine. The duplicated self smiles, then steps forward, and each footfall sends transparent ripples through its body, as though it is a stone statue carved from water. We circle each other. I notice how subtle the imitation has become: the tilt of the chin, the slight downward glance before an insightful remark. Every gesture is the mentor’s, not mine.

Momentum builds. Stars overhead descend, melting into streaks of paint that coat the pier in shimmering blues and golds. The air smells suddenly of library paper and sandalwood—my mentor’s favored scent. I realize the dream is collapsing into a single identity, crushing my unique edges beneath awe and reverence.

“No,” I say—only this time, the syllable is entirely mine: raw, unpolished, and quivering with doubt. The mirrored version hesitates. The pier jolts, splintering into bright shards that hover midair like fireflies. I clutch one of the floating planks, carve a line through the canvas of night, and draw a doorway out of sheer nothingness.

Beyond the threshold is a garden of unspoken thoughts—plants that flicker between colors whenever I remember a forgotten ambition. Orange blossoms bruise violet. Iron vines erupt with glass leaves. Somewhere, a brook hums, babbling secret drafts of poems I never dared attempt. Here, everything is simultaneously potential and unfinished.

The mirrored me follows, still wearing the silver-buttoned coat, but its reflection has begun to crack along the cheeks, fissures spreading like frost. It watches as I kneel beside a small sapling whose bark glimmers with lines of my own handwriting. I touch it, and the words flow back into my fingertips—clumsy jokes I once told, improvised melodies hummed in solitude, half-baked ideas scribbled in the margins of notebooks. All mine, thoroughly imperfect and electric with authenticity.

When I rise, the silver coat has unraveled into gossamer threads that lift into the wind. The impostor self smiles—not in triumph, but in quiet approval. Its form turns translucent, revealing an empty cavity where borrowed greatness once resided. I step forward and breathe, and the cavity fills with a swirl of colors pulled from the garden—ochre, teal, vermilion, moon-white, storm-gray. It glows with possibility. We merge, not as imitation and origin, but as a new mosaic being: half mentor, half myself, half something entirely uncharted.

The sky now brightens to dawn. The constellations unweave their patterns and settle like gentle snow on my shoulders. I know that, upon waking, I will still admire the mentor fiercely, still study their art for guidance. But the dream gifts an irrefutable memory: my own voice, rough-edged and luminous, forging paths the mentor could not foresee.

Somewhere a final bell tolls—no longer faint, no longer hidden. It’s the sound of my heartbeat aligning with a rhythm that belongs solely to me.

And so, with morning’s gold seeping into every corner of the garden, I open my eyes.

I am awake.
