I am dreaming. You find yourself stepping onto a platform made of translucent stones, each slab humming softly when your feet press against it. It’s evening, and the sky above is a tinted swirl of burgundy and lavender, the sun replaced by a floating cluster of luminous orbs that shimmer like jellyfish in slow-moving water. The air is warm yet carries a gentle breeze that tickles your skin, and the place smells strangely of sweet honey and wet earth, as if the ground had been soaked in flower nectar just moments before.

All around you, tall figures draped in cloths of varying colors move in choreographed patterns. They don’t walk; they glide. Their faces are painted with spiraling designs, and some wear crafted masks depicting mythical creatures that shift shapes in the corner of your vision. You realize with a start that you can’t quite tell if these swirling illusions are part of the masks themselves or merely an effect of this bizarre realm.

The gathering takes place in what looks like a massive courtyard at the center of an otherworldly city. Instead of buildings, you see enormous coral-like structures that tower overhead, shimmering with the same multi-hued aura as the glowing orbs. Sometimes, the walls of these structures quiver, as though alive and breathing.

A chorus of low, melodic hums resonates around you. You notice that when two locals meet, they touch the tips of their lavishly adorned elbows together and then press both palms gently to their chest. It’s an elegant gesture, one you sense is filled with deep respect and sincerity. You feel self-conscious trying to mimic it, your arms trembling slightly as you carefully bring your elbows forward. Yet the locals smile graciously, their eyes reflecting a kaleidoscope of colors, and return the gesture with warmth.

Your own attire is eerily appropriate for this place — long, intricate ribbons that bind around your arms and torso, flowing behind you like a comet’s tail. You have no idea how you came to wear these garments. It’s as if they grew onto your body for the occasion.

At the far end of the courtyard, there’s a raised platform shaped like a shell. On it stands a figure in robes woven from threads of shimmering gold and midnight-blue. The figure’s voice resonates like a low, echoing drumbeat. You can’t understand the words, but somehow their meaning seems imprinted on the air. You gather that this person is an esteemed elder of the community, leading some kind of ritual welcome.

A hush settles among the attendees. They line up gracefully, forming a circular pattern around the shell-platform. The elder extends a slender hand, revealing swirling designs tattooed across their palm. You catch your reflection in those patterns — your eyes appear a shade too bright, dancing with flickers of luminescent color. Then the elder’s other hand drifts to their own forehead, drawing a symbol with a fluid motion. One by one, the locals follow suit, each drawing the same symbol with absolute precision. Unsure what it means, you attempt to mimic them. Your heart beats a little quicker as you paint the invisible lines in the air, and you sense a collective satisfaction rippling through your surroundings, as though the space itself approves of your effort.

You notice small creatures scuttling by your feet — radiant moth-like insects with long feelers that glow whenever someone laughs. A group near you exchanges quick, tinkling laughter, and at once, these insects flare up, their luminescence pulsing in time with the rising laughter. It seems every reaction, every movement, has an echo in the environment, a vibrant synergy tying everyone and everything together.

Moments later, a gentle buzz rumbles through the crowd. An array of musical instruments — half familiar, half alien — emerges. Some resemble elongated flutes carved from iridescent shells; others are shaped like curved horns but produce notes as soft as a whisper. The local musicians blow into these instruments or pluck at strings that shimmer like spiderwebs caught in morning dew. The resulting melody feels alive, weaving through the gathering like a bright river, flowing up and down in gentle waves. You feel it coursing beneath your skin, awakening a sense of wonder and euphoria.

The elder gestures for you to step onto the shell-platform. Despite a moment’s hesitation, something propels you forward. Each footstep ripples with the hum of the slabs beneath you, as though they recognize your presence. When you reach the top, the entire crowd shifts their stance, arms rising skyward in unison. Their painted faces and masks tilt upward, and, in a surreal moment, the shimmering orbs overhead dim, casting your surroundings in soft half-light.

In this mesmerizing twilight, the locals begin to sing words that ring with an otherworldly cadence. You don’t know their language, but each syllable vibrates with meaning that goes deeper than sound, almost like your soul is absorbing it directly. The elder approaches, motioning for you to lift your hands and place them gently over your heart. As you do, warmth floods your chest, and in an inexplicable burst of absorption, you understand the crux of their message: you are a guest here, a welcome traveler brimming with possibility, and your arrival holds meaning they’ve awaited.

The crowd’s song reaches a crescendo, and a pulse of soft golden light begins radiating from the shell-platform, traveling out into the courtyard and reflecting off the living coral-like buildings. You can sense the unity among these people — they dance in a harmonious bond with their environment. The insects swirl like sparks in the night, coloring the sky with ribbons of sparkling dust. Everything seems woven into a single tapestry.

As the final note of the song hangs in the hush, you feel a lively sense of belonging that you’ve never experienced before. You open your mouth, unsure of what to say, when suddenly the ground beneath you warms, signifying the dream’s shifting tide. There’s a dazzling flash of kaleidoscopic light, and the courtyard dissolves around you — not in abrupt darkness, but in a conscious metamorphosis, as though everything you just witnessed is folding itself neatly into the layers of your mind.

When you awaken, your heart is still pounding with that resonant pulse. Even as the vision fades, you can’t help but feel that this extravagantly different world — with its humming floors, shape-shifting masks, and living coral spires — left a mark on your soul. It lingers in your chest like a secret invitation, urging you to carry some of its magic back into your waking life.
