I am dreaming. After drifting through swirling mists, I find myself standing at a crossroads in a lush, vibrant forest. The air is thick with the scent of exotic flowers and the gentle hum of exotic lifeforms I've never seen before. The trees tower above, their leaves glittering like stained glass in the dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy. Each path before me leads into the dense undergrowth, promising adventure and mystery.

To my left, a winding trail leads to a crystal-clear lake nestled in a clearing. The water shimmers an iridescent blue, almost luminous. I can see colorful fish darting among the smooth stones, occasionally leaping out of the water in a dazzling display of acrobatics. The tall grass along the lake's edge sways in the warm breeze, whispering secrets in a language I almost understand.

Directly ahead, the path forks again and merges with two distinct trails. The one on the right leads to an ancient temple, its stone walls covered in intricate carvings that seem to shift and roll beneath my gaze. I catch glimpses of shimmering treasures inside through the gaping doorway, and hear the faint peals of mysterious bells. The other trail to the left descends steeply into a valley, shrouded in a swirling, translucent mist. Curled tendrils reach out towards me, beckoning me to plunge into the unknown.

Behind me, I hear the rumbling roar of a majestic waterfall plummeting over the edge of a sea cliff. The spray rises into the air in fine droplets, catching the light like a myriad of tiny prisms. Perched on a shelf overlooking the crashing waves is a tiny, secluded grove. Vines fringed with fragrant blossoms run along the branches overhead, while soft moss cushions the rocky soil. I catch sight of a gorgeous, exotic creature with a pearlescent shell hunting along the rocky shoreline.

My heart races with the thrill of infinite possibility. Each choice before me promises an irrevocable transformation, a chance to unearth the deepest secrets of this dream world and perhaps even my own mind. I must act now, lest the fragile threads connecting these pathways begin to dissolve and fade away.

In an instant, I hear a voice calling from each direction, like an echo through the wind:

From the lake: "Step in and awaken your deepest desires."

From the temple: "Enter and become a vessel for ancient knowledge."

From the valley: "Come and dwell in the mysteries of the subconscious."

From the grotto: "Join me and forge new fantasies undreamt."

My glands are stimulated with choice. Each option shimmers with allure, a portal into the surreal depths of my own imagination. The air thrums with anticipation, and I can taste the electric promise of adventure tingling on my tongue.

I must... I must... my unconscious nudges me, bleeding into the dream around me. Left, right, forward, or back? With every fiber of my being, I reach out...

...but there is a dragon! It crumbles into dust the crumbling darkness of the world! 

...or maybe there is nothing. The cliff opens up in a focused darkness and then dissipates.

Maybe I feel movement and freed from my confortable bed, rushed around, fallen and slapped the ground in an incoming alert army's school ground. The muddy stream retains my hamburger, boiled eggs, and a gold ring my dead grandmother give me when I was ten.

The darkness overcomes reality. I'm in a sensory deprivation tank and all ideas manifest themselves.

Whose choice is it?
