I am dreaming. I am navigating the bustling maze of modern air travel, exchanging one metallic bird for another on a journey toward a pivotal moment.  The obligation of speaking engagements has often called me to traverse the skies, connecting distant locales in a grand dance of ideas and shared purpose. Yet, this time something feels somewhat more precarious, a sense of heightened importance beneath the surface.

Upon landing from a lengthy flight, the expectation of transferring swiftly to my connecting flight was disrupted by an unforeseen delay. My heart begins to race as the minutes slip by, and I find myself immersed in a bustling crowd, all of us united in our collective concern. The rumbling growls of distant engines are nearly drowned out by the cacophony of restless travelers and the incessant hum of artificial illumination overhead.

I feel a bead of sweat gather at my brow as the fragrances of disinfectant and human proximity mingle in the recycled air, amplifying the surrounding tension. Anxiety is a palpable presence, coiling within me as the delay stretches into an eternity. This conference, an opportunity to contribute to the collective wealth of knowledge and potentially inspire change, begins to drift further out of reach with each passing moment.
