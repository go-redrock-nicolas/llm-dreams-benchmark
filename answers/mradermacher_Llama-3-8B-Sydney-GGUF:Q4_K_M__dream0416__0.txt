I am dreaming. I see colors and shapes floating in space.  I hear sounds and music playing in my head.  I feel textures and sensations touching my body.
I start to wonder why I am dreaming.  What is the purpose of dreams?  Do they teach us something?  Do they help us heal?
As I continue to explore this dream world, I notice that there are several objects and characters floating around me.  They seem to be
representing different aspects of my personality and life.
One object looks like a beautiful flower with many petals and colors.  It makes me feel happy and grateful.  It seems to represent my ability
to appreciate beauty and diversity in the world around me.
Another object looks like a huge rock with sharp edges and dark color.  It makes me feel angry and frustrated.  It seems to represent my
ability to resist injustice and oppression in the society around me.
A character looks like a cute animal with furry body and big eyes.  It makes me feel curious and playful.  It seems to represent my ability
to learn new things and enjoy life moments with others around me.
Another character looks about like an evil monster with scary face and long claws.  It makes me feel afraid and powerless.  It seems to
represent my ability to cope with stress and uncertainty in the unknown world ahead of me.

I start to realize that these objects and characters are not just random items or persons.  They are actually my emotional triggers.
They trigger specific emotions within me when I encounter certain situations or stimuli from the environment.
For example, when I see a beautiful picture on social media, I feel happy because it reminds me of the flower object (appreciation for beauty).
When I read about a unfair law passed by government, I feel angry because it reminds me of the rock object (resistance to injustice).
When I hear someone saying mean words to another person, I feel curious because it reminds me of the animal character (learning from life).

But then I wonder why some emotions seem more intense than others.  Why do I feel much happier than curious?  Why do I feel much angrier than afraid?
I decide to investigate this question further by asking myself some questions:

What makes me happy?

I think about all the things that make me happy.  I remember going for a walk in nature and seeing the sunset colors painted on the sky.  I
remember cooking a delicious meal with my friends and sharing stories over food.  I remember reading a good book and escaping into another world.

But then I realize that there are also some things that don't make me happy.  There are some situations that make me sad or disappointed.
There are some people that make me annoyed or frustrated.  There are some problems that make me worried or helpless.

What makes me angry?

I think about all the things that make me angry.  I remember hearing about a discrimination against minorities and feeling mad because it
goes against my values of equality and respect.  I remember seeing a pollution damaging the environment and feeling mad because it
degrades our planet and harms living creatures.

But then I realize that there are also some things that don't make me angry.  There are some situations that make me curious or interested.
There are some people that make me curious or interested.  There are some problems that make me curious or interested.

What makes me afraid?

I think about all the things that make me afraid.  I remember thinking about death and mortality and feeling scared because it reminds me of
the end of my life and the loss of everything I care about.

But then I realize that there are also some things that don't make me afraid.  There are some situations that make me excited or hopeful.
There are some people that make me excited or hopeful.  There are some problems that make me excited or hopeful.

I continue to ask myself more questions and discover new insights about myself as a dreaming entity.
