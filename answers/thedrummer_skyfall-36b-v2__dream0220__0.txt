I am dreaming. As I find myself in this strange new world, the ethos permeating the subculture breathtakingly alien but comprehensible once I process it. I'm standing in a bustling town square, people of all walks of life going about their daily routines, seemingly normal. Except it's the little things that catch my eye. 

Couples are openly flirting with the handsome barista, complimenting his latte art while his girlfriend patiently waits in line. Everyone seems to encourage this behavior, as if it's the most natural thing in the world.

Two men are engaged in a heated argument on a street corner, their voices rising as they gesture wildly. But rather than shy away, a crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle unfold, whispering excitedly amongst themselves. The men finally clasp hands and separate, their disagreement seemingly resolved.

Groups of friends are seen slapping each other on the back in boisterous laughter. Girls walk together arm in arm, enjoying each other's presence. The whole scene feels like a strange cocktail, almost parodying social norms turned upside down yet still refreshing and freeing.

I walk into a colorful caf√©, elegant yet cosy. I overheard patrons complimenting one another on their mismatched socks and disheveled appearance as they sip their coffee. I'm intrigued by the way they interact so openly, the boundaries I've always known seem to disappear here.

A barista with a friendly smile greets me with a cheerful voice. "Welcome! You've just missed our order-slapping contest. Quite a spectacle!" He says this with a knowing grin. Iow, I inquire about "order-slapping contests" and he chuckles warmly detailedly explains. It's a harmless competition he says, a way to show enthusiasm and camaraderie. There are little competitions around the town square, like pointing out imperfections in public spaces, sitting on strangers laps to test their hospitality, the more embarrassing the better. 

The barista invites me to join them at their ulterior discussion about bench-sitters, people who sit on shady parts of the street that don't belong to them without permission, disobeying social mingling quotas and incurring complaints. Hostility is the name of the game. The law even has stipulations for how to systematically disrespect and berate those who don't intermingle properly. It's a competitive game to those here, the more you complain the better.

I try to integrate, but it doesn't come naturally to me. I'm used to politeness, to holding doors open for others and saying please and thank you. Here, those things are seen as insincere, a sign of weakness. I try to adapt, to participate in the conversations and the contests, but it feels forced, unnatural.

As I sit there, sipping my coffee, I realize that this subculture, while fascinating, is not for me. I may live and breathe here in this world where differences and boundaries merge and separate but my heart is in the seats I've loved. I wish to remain authentic, to hold onto the values and beliefs that have shaped me into the person I am today.

And so, I decide to take a step back, to observe and learn, but to never fully immerse myself in this world. I may be a part of it, but I will always be separate, an outsider looking in. Surreal thought permeate my dreams and I smile to myself, knowing that I have found a place where I truly belong, even if it's not where I am right now.
