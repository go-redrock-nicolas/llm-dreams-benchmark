I am dreaming. …find yourself standing in a landscape that seems poured from pure moonlight.

The Dream  

You are barefoot on a beach of dark glass. Each step sings—a faint chime, like distant windbells. Above, the sky is split between an indigo night smeared with star-rivers and a broad, flickering dawn that never quite arrives. Where sea should be, there is a vast, mirror-bright plain reflecting impossible constellations. You sense it is neither water nor land, but thought itself made visible—an ocean of all the things you have never said.

On the horizon stands a cathedral of bones and library stacks. Its spires are vertebrae; its stained-glass windows are pages, paragraphs forming living mosaics that rearrange themselves every time you blink. You walk toward it, drawn by the hum of forgotten stories.

Inside, the nave stretches beyond perspective. A single pendulum swings from the vaulted ceiling. Instead of a weight, a colossal eye hangs on the chain, open and unblinking. It beats like a heart. With every swing it sheds shimmering droplets that land on the marble floor and transform instantly into moths made of watch parts. They flutter upward, the ticking of their wings echoing through the aisles.

You move deeper and discover shelves packed with jars, each containing a miniature storm: corks creak under thunder. One jar is cracked, and violet lightning leaks out in a furious delta of sparks. The slipstream tugs at your pulse. A whispered voice—your own, but older—hisses behind your ear:  

“Remember which fracture is yours.”

You turn but find only the shadow of something vast and winged retreating between columns. The floor gives way to a spiral staircase plunging down into darkness. You descend, hand on the railing, which is soft and breathing like the flank of a sleeping animal. At the final step you arrive in a chamber lit by candles floating upside-down. Their flames drip upward.

In the center stands a mirror made of water. Your reflection has no eyes, only luminous keyholes. When you raise your hand, the reflection raises a knife made of frost. It shatters its own throat, and all sound drains from the room. Silence becomes so heavy it forces you to your knees. Somewhere above, the pendulum-eye crashes through the ceiling, cataract broken, pupil dilated to swallow everything—  

—and you wake.

The Awakening  

Your skin is slick, sheets tangled like constricting vines. The morning light feels sharpened, serrated. For a full minute you cannot move, convinced the eye is still swinging above your bed. The room is silent, yet every silence now reminds you of a weight threatening to crush you. Your heartbeat is a trapped bird.

Throughout the Day  

• Shower: Steam coils into rib-shaped curlicues on the tile, and for an instant you smell the crackling scent of ozone from the jar of storms. You close your eyes, water hammering, and see that reflection with keyhole eyes waiting in the faucet-silver darkness.

• Commute: Cars blur past, tail-lights ticking like moth wings. A street performer’s wind chimes jangle, and your throat clamps. You keep checking the rearview mirror, half-expecting a swinging pendulum eye in place of the sun.

• Office: Spreadsheet columns resembles cathedral aisles; scrolling cells swallow each other in silent fractals. Your co-worker mumbles through morning greetings, but the words scrape like broken glass. You smile, nod, pretend.

Attempts to Process  

Lunch break finds you in a small park. You sit beneath an ash tree, pull out your notebook, and begin free-writing:

“I have been living in a cathedral of bone-paper, chased by silence, pierced by ticking wings…”

The sentences zigzag, erratic, but something eases each time the ink loops across the page. You sketch a pendulum, then erase the eye, replacing it with a lantern. What if it could illuminate rather than devour?

After work you wander into a used-book shop—dust motes swirl like reverse candle-flames in dim orange lamplight. You choose an old dream-symbol dictionary, pages foxed and smelling of thunder. At home you brew tea, light a candle, and read: “Eyes: gateways to inner truth. Pendulum: time and inevitability. Moths: transformation through frailty. Cathedrals: sanctuaries of belief.”

Understanding trickles: The dream is telling you you’ve been a cathedral for other people’s expectations—stacked with narratives not entirely your own. The leaking storm jar? A crack in your carefully contained emotions. The reflection’s self-destruction? Your fear of seeing what is truly inside.

You set the dictionary aside. On another sheet of paper you draw the spiral staircase again, but this time you add a door at its base—something not seen in the dream. You sketch yourself opening it. Through the doorway you place a sunrise, soft and ordinary, no flickering dawn. You label it: “Exit.”

Night settles. Your chest still flutters with moth-wings of anxiety, but the rhythm slows. You stand by the window, breathing in cool dark. No eye swings in the heavens, only a full moon gently rising, pale and unblinking but not menacing. You think, Maybe it’s only watching, not judging.

Before bed you whisper: “Remember which fracture is mine, so I can mend it.”

The weight of silence lifts, fraction by fraction, and as you drift toward sleep again, the cathedral dims, shelves of storms recede, and you sense the architecture of the next dream rearranging—less bone, more blossom—answering the call of your waking will.
