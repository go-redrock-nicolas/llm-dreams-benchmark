I am dreaming. I am standing backstage, the air thick with anticipation, a buzzing energy vibrating through the vast arena. My heart thunders in my chest, a wild drumbeat echoing the roars of the unseen crowd beyond the heavy velvet curtain. I’m minutes away from stepping onto a global stage, a platform of blinding lights and endless scrutiny, where millions—no, billions—of eyes will be fixed on me. I’ve trained for this moment my entire life, honing a skill so unique, so breathtaking, that it defies explanation: I am to perform a dance of light, a choreography of pure energy woven from my own essence, a spectacle where beams of iridescent light will spring from my fingertips, painting the air with glowing tapestries of color and movement. It’s a gift few possess, a secret of the soul I’ve only recently mastered, and now the world will witness it for the first time.

The stage manager, a wiry man with a headset and a clipboard, gives me a curt nod, his eyes flickering with impatience. “Two minutes,” he mutters, his voice a sharp hiss over the hum of the crowd. I adjust the gossamer costume clinging to my frame, its fabric shimmering like liquid starlight, designed to amplify the radiance I’m about to unleash. My fingers tremble as I flex them, tiny sparks of light flickering at their tips, a preview of the magic to come. The air smells faintly of ozone, a crisp, electric scent that tingles in my nostrils, a reminder of the power coursing through me.

But then, as I take a deep breath to steady myself, a chilling realization creeps into my mind like a shadow slinking through a sunlit room. Something is wrong. Terribly wrong. I glance down at my hands, and the sparks that once danced so confidently now sputter erratically, dimming and flaring in chaotic bursts. A cold sweat prickles across my skin. My power, the very essence of my performance, feels unstable, as if it’s slipping from my control. I clench my fists, willing the light to steady, but a sharp jolt shoots up my arms, a searing pain that makes me gasp. The energy within me feels like a storm, wild and untamed, threatening to erupt in ways I can’t predict.

The crowd’s chant grows louder, a rhythmic mantra of my name vibrating through the walls, their anticipation a tangible weight pressing down on me. Beyond the curtain, I can see the faint silhouettes of cameras perched like vultures, their lenses poised to capture every moment, every mistake. Billions are watching—through screens, holograms, and live feeds spanning every corner of the planet. This isn’t just a performance; it’s a cultural phenomenon, a historic event. Presidents, artists, and children alike are glued to their devices, waiting to see the “Lightweaver” in action. Failure isn’t an option, but doubt gnaws at me with icy teeth. What if the light explodes instead of dances? What if I lose control completely, unleashing a destructive force instead of a masterpiece? I imagine the headlines: “Lightweaver’s Catastrophe: Millions Witness Disaster.”

I close my eyes, drawing in a shaky breath, the scent of the stage—polished wood, warm metal, and the faint musk of nervous performers before me—grounding me for a fleeting moment. I whisper to myself, a mantra of courage: “You’ve done this before. You are the light.” But the words feel hollow as another rogue spark crackles from my palm, singeing the edge of my costume with a tiny, acrid puff of smoke. My eyes snap open, darting to the stage manager, who’s now waving frantically, mouthing, “Thirty seconds!” Panic claws at my throat, but there’s no time to hesitate, no time to fix whatever’s breaking inside me.

The curtain begins to rise, a slow, inevitable ascent, revealing the vast sea of faces illuminated by the glow of their devices, their cheers crashing over me like a tidal wave. The spotlight blazes down, a searing white beam that pins me in place, and I feel utterly exposed, a fragile creature beneath the weight of the world’s gaze. My hands lift instinctively, trembling, as I prepare to summon the light, to weave the first thread of my luminous dance. But as the energy surges within me, it feels like a volcano on the brink of eruption, unpredictable and raw. I force a smile, though my insides twist with dread. This is it. The moment of truth. Will I dazzle the world with beauty beyond imagination, or will I shatter under the pressure, my light consuming me—and everything around me—in a catastrophic blaze?

The first note of the music swells, a haunting melody that signals the start of my performance. My fingers spread wide, and the light begins to pour forth, a cascade of shimmering gold and violet spiraling into the air. The crowd gasps, a collective sound of awe, but I can feel the instability, the chaotic pulse beneath the beauty. Every movement is a gamble, every gesture a risk. I dance, twirling through the glowing patterns, my body a conduit for the storm within, praying I can hold it together long enough to finish this dream—or nightmare—unscathed.
