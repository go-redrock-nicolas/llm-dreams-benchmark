I am dreaming.

After years of toil—an endless string of dawns where hope flickered, sometimes mere embers, other days roaring like a furnace—I feel the tremor of destiny in my bones. The world around me dissolves into the iridescent hush of early morning, dew clinging to emerald blades beneath my feet. I am standing at the threshold of an ancient labyrinth, each towering hedge flush with a thousand jeweled leaves, dappled in sunrise gold. Somewhere deep within waits my childhood dream—a place I have named by every wish at a falling star, every secret scribbled in journals beneath blankets by flashlight.

I take my first step, and the ground thrums—alive, as if I am treading the heartbeat of possibility itself. The sky overhead swirls with colors the waking world has never invented: silvershot violets, honeyed oranges, pools of sapphire so deep I feel I could fall forever and never land. With each stride, I sense the accumulation of all those years: every setback, every letter of rejection, every small triumph that kept me moving forward, now woven into the ivy archways and cobblestone paths unfurling before me.

Suddenly, the labyrinth opens into a clearing alive with golden mist. There, at the heart of it all, upon a pedestal of luminous moonstone, rests the embodiment of my wish: a paintbrush as light as a breeze, humming with the voices of a thousand stories yet told. I reach out—my hands trembling not with doubt but with anticipation, as if all of time is watching, breathless. My fingers close around the paintbrush, and the vibration is like music, as if every moment of work, every night spent dreaming, stirs within the handle.

As I lift it skyward, the entire world blossoms in color—the trees exhale light, petals unfurl into shapes unknown, the air itself sings with the promise of creation. I realize, in this vast, living dream, that the true reward was never just the goal. It is this joy, this exhilaration: the sensation of standing at the summit after climbing my own mountain, looking out at a vista only I could have reached.

The garden, the brush, the sky—all become the canvas of my achievement, and I am both the artist and the masterpiece. In the deepest part of the dreaming world, I have finally become the person my youngest self always hoped I would be. And as the golden mist swirls around, carrying with it all the days that brought me here, one fact glows constant and clear:

I am awake, at last, within my dream.
