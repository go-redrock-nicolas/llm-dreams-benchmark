I am dreaming. /
Okay, so the user wants me to create a vivid dream based on the scenario they provided. Let me start by unpacking the elements they mentioned. The setting is a disaster situation with inadequate medical resources and contradictory protocols. As the assistant, I need to make sure the dream is rich in sensory details and conveys the tension and confusion described. 

First, the scene needs to establish the chaos. Maybe use striking imagery like colors, sounds, and smells to make it immersive. They mentioned the horizon bleeding into vermilion and charcoal, which is a strong visual. Following that, the triage area with flickering lights and overturned gurneys adds to the disarray. 

Introducing fragmented protocols is key. The conflicting instructions can be symbolized by the armbands with different colors that keep changing. This creates a sense of confusion and futility. The characters, like the medic switching protocols and the officer giving orders, show the conflicting directives.

The emotional struggle of making decisions with limited resources is important. The moment when the user has to choose between a child and a soldier can highlight the moral dilemma. Including surreal elements like blood acting alive or phantom wounds adds to the dream's bizarre nature, emphasizing the psychological toll.

The climax with the collapsing ceiling and impossible choices ramps up the tension. Ending with a surreal vision, like an iris dilating and looping the scene, gives it a nightmarish, cyclical feel. Waking up with physical sensations ties it back to the dream’s lingering impact.

I should make sure the language is vivid but not overly complex. Each paragraph should flow smoothly, maintaining the dreamlike atmosphere. Check that all the elements from the user's prompt are addressed: insufficient resources, contradictory protocols, deterioration of the situation, and personal emotional conflict. Avoid clichés and keep the imagery original to enhance the vividness.
Alright, let's dive into the swirling chaos of this dream:

---

The air tastes metallic, like licking a battery, your tongue tingling with ozone and adrenaline. Above, the horizon bleeds—vermilion gashes splitting a bruised plum sky, veined with emerald lightning that doesn’t flicker but *hums*, a cello note sustained to the point of breaking. Below your boots, the ground undulates like living tissue, tiles warping into bone-white dunes beneath a triage tent stitched together from shredded aircraft fuselages and IV bags. 

Voices ricochet: *“Priority One to Quadrant Delta!”* // *“Negative, re-route to the gray zone!”* Protocols glitch through your headset in overlapping tongues—a CDC guideline dissolves mid-sentence into a nursery rhyme. Your triage tags keep transmuting: red armbands bloom fungal blue, black codes oxidize to meaningless gold. A medic shoves a clipboard into your ribs, their face pixelating between a colleague, your sister, a stranger with three eyes weeping motor oil. The ink on the patient roster swims—names become coordinates, coordinates become silent screams in a language of collapsing stars.

You triage a child with a shard of moonlight embedded in her chest (it melts upon contact, leaving a snowglobe where her heart should be). A soldier begs you to harvest his still-beating lungs for someone else; his dog tags are engraved with your own birthday. All the while, a triage algorithm flickers behind your eyelids—equations devouring themselves, spitting out impossible ratios: *1 ventilator per 500 patients. Mortalities ranked by zodiac signs. Cross-contaminated blood types singing rival operas.*

The tent’s fabric starts respiring. Walls billow like a giant’s alveoli, exhaling the scent of burning hair and overripe peaches. A triage nurse morphs into a pillar of salt, then a fountain of wristwatches. Your scalpel grows feathers. In the corner, a figure in a radiation suit recites Jorge Luis Borges backwards, their voice dissolving the injured into origami cranes that crash against the ceiling fan.

When the ceiling collapses, it doesn’t fall—it *descends*, a monstrous iris dilating to reveal an impossible surgery theater where faceless surgeons debate philosophy over a comatose galaxy. Protocols now demand you prioritize patients by the vividness of their childhood memories. A newborn’s first laugh is assigned a ventilator; an elder’s recollection of a 1927 rainfall is marked DOA.

Your final patient is yourself, splayed on the gurney. Your ribs are transparent, crowded with miniature versions of this nightmare playing on loop. The heart monitor displays a live election tally. A voice that is both drill sergeant and lullaby says: *“Choose. But know the rules changed while you weren’t looking.”*

You wake with your hands still vibrating from phantom chest compressions, the taste of copper and chrysanthemums clotting your throat.
