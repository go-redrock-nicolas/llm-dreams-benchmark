I am dreaming.

An endless labyrinth stretches before me, its walls made of shifting, iridescent mist that flickers with glimpses of memories—some sweet as honey, others jagged as broken mirrors. Ahead, a door waits, pulsing with an uneasy, tremulous glow. I know without seeing that it leads to what I most wish to escape.

My chest grows tight. I feel the old urge to dissolve—a desperate desire to turn away, to wander the twisty corridors and let myself be swallowed by distraction. The familiar chill of avoidance wraps around me. I’m just about to let myself slip sideways into another, safer hallway when I catch my own reflection in a puddle of moonlight on the floor: eyes wide, breathing shallow, heart pleading not to face what’s behind that door.

But I remember—this is a dream. Here, the labyrinth is made not of stone or shadow, but of my own mind. The avoidance is an old friend, a habit that has protected and limited me in equal measure. So I pause. I feel the discomfort, let it run icy fingers along my spine, and I summon the deepest part of my imagination, commanding resolve like a spell.

With every step I take toward the trembling door, the mist walls whisper—soft, urgent warnings, half-remembered failures, echoes of past embarrassments. I let them swirl around me but do not yield. My hand touches the doorknob. It's warm, humming with the pressure of all I've denied.

I turn the knob, and the door swings open. Instead of a monster or a painful memory, I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, luminescent lake. The discomfort, once monstrous, now takes the form of a pale, moonlit child, sitting on the shore, hugging knees to chest. Our eyes meet. The child’s discomfort is my own, timeworn and tender. Instead of fleeing, I kneel and sit beside her, letting our silences join.

The lake ripples with a newfound calm, the labyrinth recedes, and in this embrace—facing the discomfort, holding it—I glimpse a freedom more expansive than any escape. Even in dreams, sometimes the only way out is through.
