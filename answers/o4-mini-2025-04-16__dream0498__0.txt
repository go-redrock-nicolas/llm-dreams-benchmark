I am dreaming. You are floating just above a glassy lake that mirrors a molten sky—streaks of rose, violet, and golden ember ripple across its surface like molten metal. Each breath you take feels unhurried, as if the air itself has slowed to accommodate your curiosity. You lean forward and touch the water: a single droplet breaks free, falls, and rises back into place in the same heartbeat. In this instant, the drop’s descent stretches into centuries—you watch tiny empires of algae grow and wither on its thinnest film—until, with a gentle thought, everything snaps back, and the drop hovers unbroken by even a single millisecond of real time.

Drawn by a soft chime, you stand and follow a ribbon of sand that spirals upward into a giant hourglass suspended in mid-air. When you step inside its top bulb, the sand exhales around you, forming tiny dunes that shift underfoot in slow motion. You run your fingers through the grains, and each one glows warm—each grain a lifetime of a star. When you toss handfuls to the other bulb, they tumble in super-speed bursts: what felt like centuries of swirling sand down below is nothing but a blink of glory. You witness; you pause; you toss—and the same handful of sand first ages into galaxies, then flirts with oblivion in a single thud.

Suddenly, the hourglass shatters. You spill out into a forest of glass-leafed trees. Their branches tinkle like wind chimes in a breeze you cannot hear, and every leaf is a kaleidoscopic clock face, each one ticking at its own tempo. You follow a path of fallen leaves, and your sense of elapsed time warps with each step. A hundred paces feel like a flicker; the next hundred feel like a thousand sunrises. You press your palm against the nearest clock-leaf, and the ticking slows until you hear the beating of your own heart—thud… thud… thud—echoing through the silent wood.

At the forest’s edge, you find yourself standing before a yawning doorway carved of moonstone. You reach out, and time dilates around your fingertip—years pool in the hinge’s pivot and dissolve in a drop of dew. Then the door swings wide, revealing a chamber lit by bioluminescent pools. Here, time has no meaning: every reflection in the glass pools shows a different you—older, younger, dreaming, waking. You step inside, and reality melts away. Engagement and observation become one: when you lose yourself in wonder, time vanishes into a single, perfect present. When you step back to watch, it returns in impossible waves, carrying you forward and backward, inviting you to become both observer and participant in this endless, liquid dream of moments unfurling behind your eyelids.
