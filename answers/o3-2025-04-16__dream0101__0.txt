I am dreaming. …snap awake in a seat that feels more like the embrace of a giant silver-blue flower than a chair. A translucent canopy unfurls above your head, revealing a cathedral of stars that seem close enough to pluck out of the sky and tuck behind your ear. Indigo nebulas coil around the hull like cosmic seaweed; distant suns flare in opalescent oranges.

Every console around you is alive with glyphs that melt and re-form as if written in liquid mercury. One icon blazes crimson—the universal color of catastrophe—even if you have no idea what any of these symbols mean. A chill races down your spine: “CRITICAL CORE BREACH IN 23 MINUTES,” the ship tells you in a voice equal parts lullaby and thunder.

Your name? Blank. Your memories? Sand slipping through invisible fingers. Yet your body moves as though it has rehearsed this ballet hundreds of times. You bark commands in an alien tongue you have never studied; the words pour out like birdsong wrapped in static. A pair of hovering drones—floating bronze cubes draped in violet magnetic ribbons—dart to your side, projecting data streams that stretch and fold like origami in mid-air.

First problem: the plasma-fused quantum filament—whatever that is—has snapped, and raw stellar energy is seeping toward the crew quarters. You can almost taste ozone in the corridors, hear the muffled gasp of sleeping passengers who have no idea a miniature sun is about to bloom in their midst.

You sprint—or rather, glide—in near-gravity. The corridor lights ripple, responding to your heartbeat. Walls made of holo-glass display moving frescoes: memories? Dreams? One panel shows you as a child chasing fireflies on a lavender prairie under three moons; another depicts you floating in a zero-g library with books that turn into butterflies when opened. None of it helps you fix the ship, but it tugs at your lost past like a persistent little sister.

Entrance to Engineering: a circular iris door that dilates wider the closer you approach. Beyond it, the core chamber glows—an artificial star caged in a lattice of prismatic beams. Threads of molten gold leak from a rupture no wider than a coin, but wide enough to doom you all. Radiant waves thrum through your sternum like a second heartbeat.

You tap your wrist. An interface blooms in front of your hand: concentric rings of equations orbiting a 3-D schematic. Instinct takes over. You twist one ring, slide another, and a history of the ship’s design unfurls—blueprints etched in ultraviolet. You finally see it: the quantum filament routes itself through a labyrinth of resonance chambers, but a bypass—an old test port left over from prototype days—could reroute the load if someone is insane enough to climb out on the exterior hull and patch it manually.

Cue the ship’s AI, affectionately addressed as “Solace.” Its voice crackles: “External hull temperatures exceed two thousand kelvin. Repair probability: 8 %.” You answer with a crooked grin you didn’t know you could muster. “Eighty percent after I improvise,” you lie.

Airlock. The suit that greets you resembles liquid chrome poured over your skin. It seals with a hiss and floods your bloodstream with nanites that taste faintly of peppermint. You step into the vacuum—only it’s not silent. Instead, space hums, a deep whale-song you feel more than hear. Stardust drifts like snowflakes; when they land on your visor they burst into fractals of violet.

You tether yourself to the hull, magnetized boots clanging softly. The planet below is an emerald swirl of oceans and thunderclouds; a ring system arcs across your peripheral vision like a frozen rainbow. Somewhere inside that rainbow, time seems to bend. You glimpse a reflection in your visor: not just yourself, but versions—an older you with scarred cheeks, a younger you beaming with wonder, an ageless you made of starlight—all superimposed like a cosmic flipbook. The ship, the dream, the missing memories—they converge in that reflection.

At the rupture, the heat shimmers. Your gloves bloom with microscopic petals that absorb the excess energy—adaptive tech again driven by muscle memory you can’t recall learning. You clamp the bypass conduit, reroute the flow. Alarms mute. The miniature sun retreats, contained once more in its lattice. Hull temperature drops. “Core stability restored,” Solace purrs, almost bashful. “Catastrophe averted.”

You float there a moment, heart pounding, staring at the stars that feel like long-lost kin. Then, just as triumph warms your chest, a tremor ripples through the universe like someone flicking a cosmic bedsheet. The Emerald planet blinks out of existence—poof—replaced by an endless hallway of mirrors. The hull dissolves into mist. Your suit becomes moth wings. Now you’re standing barefoot on a marble floor slick with dew, beneath chandeliers made of captured lightning.

A door you’ve never seen swings open. Someone—maybe you, maybe not—whispers: “Time to wake up again, Captain.”

And you do.

You open your eyes in your own bed, heart still banging against your ribcage. The early sunlight spills across your blankets in familiar earthbound gold. Yet, as you sit up, a single mote of violet stardust floats down onto your pillow and vanishes with a wink—like a secret handshake from a universe you’re no longer certain was just a dream.
