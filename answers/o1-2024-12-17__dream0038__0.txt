I am dreaming. You bolt upright at your desk in a flurry of neon-pink papers and glowing computer screens—only the desk is floating atop a gently undulating wave pool, and all around you, an entire open-concept office bobs and sways. The walls aren’t really walls, but towering windows threaded with veins of glittering starlight. You realize with both confusion and wonder that the floor seems to be an endless expanse of pearlescent water, reflecting the swirl of galaxies beneath your feet. Yet, you know you’re at your startup’s headquarters because each floating cubicle is labeled with your company’s name, which pulses in deep, emerald green letters. 

Suddenly, an immense thunderous crack reverberates through the water, causing giant ripples to bat each cubicle like they were flimsy rafts. You see your employees clinging to their workstations, eyes wide with terror as they search for reassurance. Overhead, a black storm cloud shaped like a menacing scoreboard flickers red numbers—this is the sum of your dwindling funds and mounting public scrutiny. Investors appear as translucent specters, pacing around, whispering anxiously among themselves. Their murmurs glow as speech-bubble lights above their heads, each one a different neon hue of fear. The walls seem to press in, the starlight dims, and the water pulses faster with every rumor of capital drying up, every swirling question about the future. Your heartbeat thunders like an out-of-tune drum.

Fighting back panic, you stand tall upon your water-lapped desk. Your voice emerges in a warm golden glow, echoing across the rippling office. You thank the investors, acknowledging their fear, but painting a vivid vision of your next great pivot. The desks begin to drift together to form one monumental raft. Employees lock arms, their murmurs of doubt dissolving into determined hushes. You open a brilliant turquoise blueprint—part strategy, part cosmic chart—that reveals a new product, one that hums with promise. As the spectral board members look on, the storm overhead slowly recedes, and the scoreboard’s red digits flicker, holding off the threat of final doom. A hush follows, and in that powerful stillness, you feel your heartbeat calm, your mind fill with clarity. The water below grows tranquil, reflecting a final sunrise of possibility. You exhale, and as you do, the entire scene begins to dissolve into a sunrise of golden light—your heart thrumming with the knowledge that not all dreams must end in nightmares.
