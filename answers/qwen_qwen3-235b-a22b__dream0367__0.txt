I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt honey and static, as if the world is caught between a memory and a premonition. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are made of glass, their crystalline branches refracting a thousand versions of the same scene: a child weeping, a king laughing, a star collapsing. Each prism-shard flickers, insisting its truth is *the* truth, yet none hold still long enough to be grasped. You blink, and the forest becomes a bridge suspended over an abyss, the planks carved from questions you once whispered to the dark: *Who am I when no one is watching? What if the lie is the only honest thing?* The bridge stretches in both directions, each step forward a step backward, each shadow a silhouette of someone you’ve been, could’ve been, might yet become.  

A river surges beneath you, but it flows upward, dragging fish with translucent scales that sing in the voices of strangers you’ve never met but somehow mourn. You kneel to touch the water, and your reflection splinters into fragments—a warrior with a sword of ice, a poet with ink-stained lips, a hollow-eyed wanderer clutching a compass that points everywhere and nowhere. They all speak at once, their words weaving a tapestry of contradictions: *"You are the wound and the salve. You are the storm and the one who waits for it to pass. You are a story half-remembered, a note struck out of tune but still humming in the silence."*  

You rise, disoriented, and the bridge dissolves into a desert of mirrors. Each pane tilts to reveal a different sky—a storm of clock hands ticking backward, a void studded with eyes that blink in unison, a canvas dripping molten gold. A figure approaches, their face a shifting mosaic of familiar and alien features. They offer you a key forged from a bone you once broke, and when you take it, the desert becomes a library. The books here have no pages, only spines that whisper riddles when you stroke them: *"The thief who steals your name loves you. The door you fear to open has already been opened. The end is where the beginning hides."*  

You wander until the shelves melt into a city of towers built from stacked paradoxes. The architecture defies gravity, spirals twisting into themselves, windows opening onto rooms that don’t exist until you look away. A crowd gathers, their faces blank as untouched parchment, yet their voices roar in a chorus: *"We are the sum of your maybes. We are the ghosts of choices unmade. We are realer than you think."* You try to speak, but your tongue turns to smoke, and the words scatter like crows into the smog-choked heavens.  

Then—a stillness. The city folds like origami into a single lotus bloom resting on a pond of liquid mercury. The flower pulses, its petals etched with equations that unravel and reknit with each breath you take. You lean closer, and your own heartbeat echoes from its core, syncopated, alien. When you reach out, the pond ripples, and the bloom becomes a mirror. Your reflection stares back, but it is not yours: it is a faceless entity with galaxies swirling in its depths, humming a lullaby that sounds like the birth cry of universes.  

You wake with the taste of stardust on your lips, the dream’s paradoxes coiled in your chest like a serpent eating its own tail. The ambiguity remains—sharp, unyielding, *alive*—a reminder that some truths are not puzzles to solve, but landscapes to wander, forever half-known, forever becoming.
