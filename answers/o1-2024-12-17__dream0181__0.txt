I am dreaming. You arrive at a sweeping palace of pale green stone, its lofty spires twisting into the swirling sky. Clouds shaped like crystalline dragons drift overhead, flickering with faint threads of gold lightning. As you step across the echoing foyer—where marble floors inlaid with gleaming constellations shimmer beneath your feet—you realize something astounding: You now reign as the supreme authority of this impossible place. Guards in mirrored armor line the halls, their helms casting your own reflection back at you. You have no memory of training for leadership, no recollection of political grooming or any such traditional instruction, and yet the kingdom’s seal has been thrust into your hand.

The edict announcing your appointment was delivered with inconceivable pomp by a host of musicians playing elongated silver horns that curve around your shoulders, nearly tangling you in threads of sound. Ministers in robes that trail along the ground like living watercolor paint swirl to greet you, bowing low as though they’ve practiced for this moment all their lives. Their whispers tremble among them: “Does this new sovereign even know the old laws? Can they possibly uphold the ancient traditions?”

You sense their doubts thrumming beneath each carefully measured step. A row of courtiers leads you toward the center of the throne room, where an elaborate seat made of floating obsidian shards hovers inches above the floor. With every footstep, the room itself seems to breathe, the mosaic tiles shifting in subtle pulses of light. Finally, you settle on the throne. The weight of authority drapes around your shoulders like a heavy cloak of star-dusted velvet, while behind you, a mighty tapestry weaves itself into a new scene: your face flickers into existence, your uncertain eyes glaring back at you.

Soon, your haggard chief advisor, who looks to have spent a lifetime perfecting stern gazes, steps forward. He is the first to confront you, voice booming in righteous indignation. “Your Majesty, though the Council declared you the heir of legend, we cannot ignore facts: By the old ways, you are untested. You don’t know our treaties, our pacts, our alliances with the realms beneath the seas. You know nothing of the perils that lurk beyond the horizon gates.”

Across the throne room, others murmur in agreement. Knights with medals pinned to their polished breastplates cross their arms and frown. You sense their resentment, see it in the stiffness of their shoulders and in the thin lines of their pressed lips. You feel the swirl of confusion, not only in them but inside yourself—an immense authority has been placed upon you, and yet you shoulder a yawning gap of knowledge.

Feeling your pulse hammer against your temples, you resolve to speak. Though you stand up, the floor does not stay steady. Instead, the marble flows beneath your feet like a slow current of wet paint. You stumble but catch yourself before toppling off the astral dais. You meet each pair of critical eyes with your own, letting them see the flickers of uncertainty. Yet something in your core steels itself—some innate, unspoken power that suggests you have a right to be here, that you can learn to wield the authority entrusted to you.

“I do not know your laws,” you hear yourself say, your voice echoing strangely in the cavernous chamber. “But I know I have a responsibility to you—each of you. And I promise I won’t abandon it.” As you continue speaking, the tapestry behind you bursts to life again. Its threads rearrange into symbols you can’t quite interpret, but a collective hush falls over your attendants. The foreign glyphs seem to bestow legitimacy upon your words, your sincerity weaving its own magic in the dreamworld.

Despite the knots of doubt in your stomach, an unearthly hush of possibility hums. You make a motion with your hand—uncertain, but forceful enough to quiet any remaining murmurs. At once, the courtiers in watery robes and the knights in glimmering mail kneel, their gestures quick and unexpectedly reverent. Even the advisors with lines of skepticism etched on their faces dip their heads, as if compelled by an invisible force.

“I may be untested,” you continue, “but I stand ready to be tested. Challenge me, teach me, show me the path that must be walked.” Beneath your words, a new wind sighs through the hall, rustling phantom silk draperies overhead. The glass windows open out onto swirling vistas of alien seas and glittering mountains. Dawn and dusk seem locked in a dance on the horizon, painting the sky in equal measures of rosy gold and shadowy purple.

When you finish, a hush settles, as though the dream itself is holding its breath. You glance around, uncertain of what reaction will greet you, but every face in the hall watches with a shared curiosity. Carefully, your chief advisor straightens, his stern expression yielding to something like tempered respect. He taps his staff against the floor—twice, in measured beats—before he finally speaks again.

“Very well. If this is your will, we begin at once.”

A strange thrill sparks in your chest. The tapestry behind you swirls, changing color, as if the entire palace recognizes a new chapter has begun. And deep in your heart, you sense you have taken the first enchanted step along a winding path—one that might lead you to become the ruler this dreamy realm truly needs. Then, with the next blink, the spires twist out of sight, the golden dragons dissolve into the murmuring sky, and you’re released from that realm. 

But in the seconds before you awaken, you feel it: a touch of that throne’s energy clinging to your fingertips, a whisper of the responsibility still coiled in your chest like a living flame. You might still be untested, unsure—but part of you knows your time in that dream realm has irrevocably changed you.
