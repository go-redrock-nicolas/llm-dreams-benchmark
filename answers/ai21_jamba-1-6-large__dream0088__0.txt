I am dreaming. The captain’s voice stings with urgency as he shouts orders to stabilize the ship. The decks pitch violently beneath your feet. Waves crash over the sides, drenching you in a spray so cold it feels like needles piercing your skin. The storm has come out of nowhere, massive and unyielding, as though the ocean itself has risen up to drown you.  

The ship lurches to one side, and you slam into the railing, barely catching yourself in time. Lightnings split the sky, a crackling web of light that illuminates the chaos. Sailors scream as the mast splinters, wood and rigging plummeting into the churning sea. You feel the ship shudder—something vital has been torn loose. 

You scramble across the deck, grasping for purchase on the slippery wood. Flames flicker somewhere below deck—a fire from the lightning strike, you realize with horror. Water and fire, competing to consume you. You have to reach the lower levels, to try to put out the flames or at least save the supplies, but each attempt is thwarted. The storm seems alive, intent on keeping you away.  

A wave crashes over the deck, pulling you down with it, and for a moment, you’re underwater. The sea roars in your ears, disorienting you. It takes every ounce of strength to fight your way back to the surface, gasping for air. Something hard strikes your head—a piece of debris—and black spots dance in your vision.  

Through the rain, you see a faint glow in the distance. Another ship? An illusion? You’re not sure if it’s a beacon of hope or a trick of the storm, but you cling to it, using it as a guide as you struggle back to your feet. Water swirls around your waist, pulling at you, threatening to drag you into the abyss. You lock your hands onto the railing and hold on with everything you have, refusing to let go. 

Dim voices call out, barely audible over the storm. Someone is yelling about the fire. You force your legs to move, dragging yourself toward the hatch that leads below. The heat hits you before you even descend—smoke chokes the air, making your eyes sting. Below, the fire rages unchecked, gnawing at the ship’s hull. Your heart sinks. There’s no way to contain it now—this ship is doomed.

A flicker of something breaks through the smoke. The edges of your vision blur. A constant hum dulls the cacophony of the storm. A disjointed voice whispers, "The ship is dragging. The clock is broken. Two thousand holes in the ocean floor."  

The storm, you think, isn’t real. The fire is too bright, the water too cold. Something is wrong. Your mind is screaming at you to wake up, but your body is trapped here, in this dream, fighting through the storm that’s not real. 

And then, as if the storm hears your thoughts, the rain stops. The wind dies. The sea stills. In the sudden calm, you see it. The ship is sinking, tearing itself apart, but the storm has vanished. It was never the storm you were fighting. It was the ship all along. 

The sun breaks through the clouds, and you wake up.
