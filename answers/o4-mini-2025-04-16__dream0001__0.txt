I am dreaming.  

I find myself thrust into a city that stretches farther than my eyes can wander—a cathedral of impossibly tall buildings, each façade alive with pulsing hues of violet, emerald, and molten gold. The air carries a scent that’s half-baked pastry, half-ocean spray. My heart hammers as I glance at a timepiece in my palm: fifty-five minutes until my meeting. Problem is, I have no clue where to go.  

Panicking, I vault off a glossy marble bench and stumble onto a broad boulevard. The pavement glows beneath my feet in shifting constellations, as though I tread upon a fragment of the night sky itself. Around me, people drift by—some clad in coats woven from living shadows, others with hair braided from threads of sunrise. Their faces are kind but unfathomable; when I ask for directions, their lips part in silent arches of curiosity before they drift onward, leaving me to my own wild thoughts.  

A giant clock tower rises ahead, its hands spinning madly, colliding with each other in sparks of iridescent light. I dash beneath its pendulum, and the roar of its ticking echoes in my chest. I step into a narrow alley where the walls are lined with living murals—scenes that shift under my gaze: a fox leaping over a river of mercury, a suspended garden blooming nightly with translucent lotus. Each image seems to whisper a clue, but I cannot decipher them before they dissolve into strokes of color and vanish.  

Time bleeds into itself. I burst out of the alley into a market square hung with lanterns like floating jellyfish. Vendors cry their wares: crystalline apples that hum verses from forgotten languages, robes that swirl with captured lightning. My hands twitch with urgency; I pluck a glowing apple from a stall and bite into it. Its flavor is paradoxical—earthy and yet electrifying—and in that instant, the neon skyline refocuses. I glimpse, across the plaza, a council chamber built of translucent alabaster, its entrance guarded by two statues of winged lions whose eyes flicker with living flame. A quiet certainty ripples through me: this must be the place.  

I sprint toward the chamber, weaving between throngs of silent observers. The wind shifts, carrying a distant chime of bells that toll the quarter-hour mark. My pulse syncs with their rhythm as I push open the heavy doors. Inside, a long table of polished onyx gleams beneath floating orbs of soft light. Figures in finely tailored garments—our meeting’s participants, I sense—rise to greet me with expectant nods.  

My breath steadies as I cross the threshold. The city’s wild beauty and my frantic journey fade into a single moment of calm focus. I place one hand on the edge of the table, steel myself, and prepare to speak—just as the clock outside begins its final, resonant chime.
