I am dreaming. **The Dream of Tasting Light and Hearing the Rainbow**  

I am standing on a shore, but it isn’t made of sand—it’s an undulating expanse of liquid silver, shifting like mercury under a sky that pulses with colors I can *hear.* The clouds hum in deep, resonant bass notes like cello strings stretched taut between the stars, and the wind doesn’t just brush against my skin—it tastes like crystallized honey, golden and slow-dripping, dissolving on my tongue with every gust.  

A wave rises before me, but instead of salt and spray, it releases music—not just sound, but *flavors.* The crash is a burst of tart plum and electric citrus, notes of a piano sonata rippling in gradients of indigo and crimson. I laugh, and my own voice spirals into the air as shimmering ribbons of flavor: vanilla-laced laughter, caramelized wonder.  

A flock of birds overhead doesn’t just fly—they leave trails of melted chocolate in the air, their wingbeats resonating as cellophane whispers, edible and delicate. I reach out, and the horizon *sings*—a low, throbbing hum that tastes of dark cherries and crushed violets. Every hue has texture, every sound a body I can hold between my teeth.  

I run, and the ground beneath me exhales the scent of violins—warm cedar and rosin, notes of crushed black pepper and velvet. The trees sway in a symphony of cinnamon and distant thunder, their leaves whispering secrets in a dialect of saffron and mint.  

I realize then—art was never meant to be separated. Not sight from sound, not taste from touch. The universe sings in harmonies I can devour, in colors I can *swallow whole.* I open my mouth to the sky, and the stars dissolve on my tongue—cold, sparkling bursts of champagne and silver, each one a shattered lullaby.  

I wake trembling, my fingers still humming with the ghost of a melody I could almost taste.  

The dream fades.  

But my tongue still remembers the song.
