I am dreaming. I see that I am walking through a beautiful and serene forest, there are flowers blooming and the leaves rustle slightly as a gentle breeze whispers sweet nothings in my ears. The cool air is quite refreshing and it keeps me company as I tread the path deeper into the thicket.

Through the deepest parts of my imagination, I let these woods go on for as far as my mind's eye can see.

As I continue on my journey, I come across a magnificent mansion. It is grandiose and its architecture is almost otherwordly. I decide to explore it and as I enter through its gates, I am greeted by a grand marble fountain whose waters shimmer in the ethereal moonlight. The front door is slightly ajar and I peek inside to find that the interior of the mansion is filled with treasures beyond my wildest dreams. 

In a hidden room, I discover a small, golden key. The key seems to beckon for me to take it, but I pause. Stealing is wrong, I tell myself. However, as I gaze upon the key, I start to rationalize. "Perhaps this key belongs to no one," I think. "Maybe it's a spare, or an artifact long forgotten." Slowly, my justifications weave a web around my moral compass, and I find myself reaching for the key.

As I take it, the entire room ripples and shimmers, the walls melt away, and I find myself standing atop a towering mountain. The view is breathtaking, with an endless expanse of sky and clouds above me, and the world below me blanketed in a quilt of greens, browns, and blues. The crisp, cool breeze at this altitude refreshes and invigorates me.

I realize that the act of stealing the key unlocked this vision and perhaps many others. Feeling a mix of guilt and exhilaration, I go on to explore the vast ethereal landscape that has unfolded before me. I soar through the skies, treasuring the sights and wonders that my rationalization has unveiled.

As my dream comes to an end, the image dissolves and I can't help but wonder at the beauty and possibilities that lie beneath the surface of even the most questionable of choices.
