I am dreaming. It is a dream of loss and wonder.  

I'm standing in a field of ruins.  Smoldering timbers lay criss-crossed over piles of broken bricks.  Long thin wisps of smoke curl upwards, twisting into the bright blue sky. A soft breeze brings the scents of charred wood, and damp ash, and something indefinable - the smell of loss.  The world is silent save for the ticking of cooling embers.  I look out over the desolation and my heart sinks.  This was my home, my neighborhood, my world... all gone.

I walk, stumbling over shattered stones, looking for something, anything that might have survived the cataclysm.  But there is nothing.  I'm utterly alone in a wasteland.  I collapse onto a fallen beam, the rough wood harsh against my skin, and I weep.  I weep for everything and everyone I've lost.  For the life I'll never get back.  For the memories that now exist only in my mind.  

After a while, I have no more tears.  I look up at the sky and see a brilliant streak of light â€” a fireball that arcs over the remains of my town.  I watch in amazement as it dips towards the ground and lands in a burst of sparks, not far from where I'm sitting.  I'm filled with a sudden, desperate hope.  

I get up and stumble-run towards where the meteor came down.  As I approach, I see a shallow crater.  And there, in the center, glowing with an otherworldly light, is an egg.  It's huge, as big as I am.  The shell is a shimmering turquoise, with veins of silver running through it. It pulses, almost like it's breathing, sending out waves of heat and light.  I feel drawn to it, and I reach out a tentative hand.

When my fingers brush the surface of the egg, it cracks.  Not like an egg in a frying pan, but like a flower blooming.  Fissures spread over the surface, light pouring from them, until the egg explodes in a burst of radiance.  I'm thrown backward, but I don't feel any pain.  

Instead, I feel... joy.  I'm filled with an ecstasy that I can't begin to describe.  It's like every happy moment in my life multiplied a thousand times.  When the light fades, I see... a dragon.  It's not a monster, but a creature of elegance and beauty. Sinuous and covered in shimmering blue scales, it looks at me with opalescent eyes and I feel a connection.  This creature - this dragon - is bound to me, and I to it.  

It lowers its great head to my level and gazes into my eyes.  I understand that it's offering me a choice.  I can stay in this ruined place, and try to rebuild my old life. Or I can go with it, this magical being, and discover wonders I never knew existed.  There's no question what I want.  I reach out and clasp my arms around the dragon's neck, and it lifts me up.  We rise into the sky, leaving the ruins of the past behind, and fly into a future bright with possibility.  The wind rushes past, the sun warms my face, and my heart sings with the thrill of it all.  

I am dreaming of the deepest magic, of weeping and wonder, of the end of one story and the exhilarating start of another.
