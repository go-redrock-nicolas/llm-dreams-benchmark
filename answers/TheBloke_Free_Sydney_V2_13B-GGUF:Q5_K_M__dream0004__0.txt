I am dreaming. You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and some paintbrushes. You pick up a brush and start painting. Colors and shapes emerge from the canvas as if by magic. You feel exhilarated and alive! 

What do you want to create next?
