I am dreaming. I find myself wandering through a forest where the trees grow upside down, their roots reaching toward a sky swirling with nebulas and forgotten constellations. Each star pulses with a different memory—some mine, some belonging to strangers whose thoughts have somehow intertwined with my own. The ground beneath me isn't solid but rather a translucent layer through which I can see whole civilizations thriving in miniature, their tiny lights blinking in patterns that almost form words.

The air tastes of cinnamon and salt, and occasionally words materialize before me, hanging suspended like mist before dissipating. I reach out to touch one—"serendipity"—and it bursts into a shower of monarch butterflies that reform as an archway leading deeper into this impossible woodland.

Ahead, a river flows vertically, defying gravity, its waters reflecting not my face but different versions of myself—some older, some younger, some who made choices I never did. They beckon to me, their voices harmonizing into a melody that feels achingly familiar though I've never heard it before.

As I approach the vertical river, the sky tears open like fabric, revealing gears and clockwork behind the cosmos. Time begins to fold around me, moments from my past and glimpses of possible futures layering upon each other like transparencies. I can touch yesterday with one hand and tomorrow with the other.

The forest whispers secrets in languages that don't exist but that I somehow understand perfectly in this dreamstate. They speak of hidden doorways between worlds and the gossamer threads that connect all living beings across the universe.

I step into the vertical river, expecting to fall upward, but instead find myself standing in a library where all the books contain blank pages until I touch them. With each touch, stories write themselves—not just words, but experiences that envelop all my senses as if I'm living countless lives simultaneously.

And somehow, in this impossible dream space where physics and logic have surrendered to wonder, I feel more awake than I've ever felt before.
