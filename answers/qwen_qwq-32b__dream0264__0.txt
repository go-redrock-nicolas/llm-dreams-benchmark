I am dreaming. Suddenly I realize I'm falling into a familiar thought pattern that has led me to make poor decisions before. I snap myself out of it and...\n

I am dreaming. The air is thick with the iridescence of a thousand fireflies, their light flickering in time to a rhythm I can feel thrumming in my pulse. The ground beneath my feet—a patchwork of memories—is crumbling, dissolving into a mosaic of moments I’d rather forget. I’m falling, or perhaps floating, but the sensation is all too familiar: the same spiraling descent that has haunted me awake and asleep alike. The walls around me, once vivid with the murals of my childhood—a kaleidoscope of cobblestone streets and lemonade stands—are now stained with the grim hues of doubt. I can taste regret on my tongue, sharp and metallic, like biting into a silver spoon left too long in lemonade.

But then, a crackle. Like the static before a storm, but brighter, more alive. The world around me shimmers, and from the void emerges a figure—translucent yet tangible, draped in a cloak woven from starlight and shadows. Their face is a mosaic of every person I’ve ever disappointed, yet their eyes gleam with a warmth that disarms me. They extend a hand, not in pity, but in challenge.

“You’ve danced this dance before,” they say, their voice a chorus of whispers and thunder. “The loop always ends here... but what if you chose a different partner?”

Before I can respond, the dream shifts. The familiar labyrinthine corridors of my mind now burst into bloom, thorny vines unraveling into garlands of iridescent blossoms. Each petal carries a fragment of a decision—I see myself grabbing at thorns, clutching at illusions, only to recoil as they dissolve into ash. But here, now, the thorns gleam not with danger, but invitation.

I remember. Awareness flashes like a shooting star—a fragile thing, yet it sparks. The figure nods, their cloak billowing into a whirlwind of possibilities. Suddenly, the floor shifts again, becoming liquid glass. Below me swims a school of memories, their translucent bellies glowing with the luminescence of past errors. They pulse, a hypnotic countdown, and I realize: I can let myself drown, or I can swim upward, where the dream-sky is not yet inked with constellations of “what-ifs.”

Taking a breath, I close my eyes and reach—not for the familiar, but the untested. My hand meets something solid, cool, and unexpected: a door handle forged from moonlight and resolve. As I grasp it, the ground gives way, a sensation like stepping into a river of liquid light. Suddenly, I’m standing on a bridge arched over an abyss, not of void, but of colors I can’t name. The path ahead gleams with question marks, each one a golden coin tossed into some unknown well. 

The figure is gone. In their place, a single crow appears, its feathers shimmering like polished onyx. It tilts its head, and the message is clear: *Choose the road you’ve never mapped. The fear is old; the path is new.*

The bridge hums beneath my feet—a familiar yet foreign music, as if a childhood tune played on an unseen harp. My breath hitches, but the crow flies forward, and the abyss parts, not in terror, but in revelation. Below the churning colors, I glimpse constellations aligned in patterns I might yet navigate.

I step forward. Each step ignites a spark beneath the soles of my shoes, and with my next breath, I realize the dream is no longer a current pulling me under, but a sky daring me to soar. Above, the cosmos stretches, not as a ceiling but an invitation.
