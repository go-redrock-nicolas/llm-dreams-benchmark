I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of an ancient forest where the trees breathe with their own consciousness. The air shimmers with particles of golden light that dance between realms. As I step forward, my feet don't quite touch the ground but hover slightly above a path made of luminescent blue stones that pulse with each footfall.

The forest opens to reveal a vast underground cathedral carved not by human hands but by time itself. Stalactites sing in harmonies too complex for waking minds to comprehend, their crystalline structures catching light from no discernible source. Water flows upward along the walls, defying physics, creating tapestries of liquid silver that tell stories in a language I somehow understand without words.

I encounter a being composed entirely of overlapping memories—both mine and others I've never lived. Its form shifts between human, animal, and geometric patterns impossible in three dimensions. When it speaks, I taste its words as different flavors: truth is cinnamon, wisdom is salt-caramel, mystery is dark chocolate with sea salt.

The being guides me to a library where books read themselves aloud in whispers. Each book contains a different possible future, and as I move between the shelves, I feel timelines branching and converging around me like neural pathways in a cosmic brain.

Suddenly, the floor becomes a mirror reflecting not my face but all the versions of myself that could have been. I kneel to touch one reflection and fall through, experiencing a lifetime in seconds—loves, losses, triumphs—before being gently returned to the cathedral space.

The air thickens with possibilities. Colors exist here that have no names in waking life. I breathe them in and feel my consciousness expanding beyond the boundaries of my dreaming self, connecting to something vast and ancient that has always been there, waiting.
