I am dreaming. …speak, but the words seem to flow out of you like shimmering ribbons, each sentence traced with light that dances through the air. The podium feels strangely warm beneath your fingertips, as though the wood is alive with energy and waiting to carry your voice to every corner of this vast space. The spotlight overhead is a gentle glow of lavender, not the harsh white you’re used to, and it bathes the audience in a luminous haze that makes each face appear like a ghostly reflection in the golden rows of seats.

You pause, heart pounding, as a hushed rustling washes through the crowd—like the whisper of distant sea waves. Everything is silent except for that tidal whisper and the steady rhythm of your breath, amplifying each moment until it feels monumental. Your mouth opens, and at first, no sound emerges. Yet somehow, the silence carries your unvoiced emotion. There is a collective intake of breath from the audience, as though they sense something grand and unseen about to break free.

Then you speak. Strangely, with each word you utter, colorful crystals float from your lips, hovering in the air, shimmering with every color of the spectrum. They chime together in delicate notes that punctuate your voice, soft and uplifting, as if sound has physically manifested around you. You watch, fascinated, as the drifting crystals spiral down onto the stage, dissolving like snowflakes the moment they touch the floor.

The crowd leans forward, transfixed, their eyes shimmering with a rapt eagerness. You feel a sense of unity with them, a bond that pulses like a heartbeat. Heat radiates from your core, fueling your speech as you talk about courage, transformation, and the radiant light of potential lodged in every person present. With each word, you notice the massive red velvet curtains swaying in time with your heartbeat, drawing back to reveal an endless horizon—no backstage behind it, just rolling hills of lilac-colored grass illuminated by golden sunlight.

A gust of wind flows in, carrying the scent of summer rain and distant jasmine flowers. The stage itself begins to shift, extending forward across the hills, forming a path of gleaming, polished boards. Encouraged by the unconditional love emanating from the audience, you step away from the microphone and walk along this newly formed pathway into the bright bohemian landscape. The crowd follows without hesitation, leaving their seats to tread the stage-turned-bridge behind you. Their collective energy hums in the air, swirling around you in luscious waves of color—teal, magenta, saffron, and emerald—like a cosmic tapestry weaving around your feet.

As you lead them forward, the hills reveal hidden gardens thick with surreal blossoms: turquoise roses with glowing petals, flaming orange lilies that crackle like gentle embers, and towering sunflowers whose centers resemble starry galaxies. You pause in front of a crystalline waterfall that sparkles with shards of prismatic light, droplets turning into glittering dragonflies before vanishing in a swirl of mist. Your speech continues in a language you don’t fully recognize—yet each syllable carries an inherent meaning of hope, connection, and boundless wonder.

The people behind you laugh in delight as you raise your arms toward the sky, which suddenly brims with floating lanterns—thousands of them, drifting skyward in graceful arcs that mimic the constellations above. The entire scene feels charged with warmth, like the embrace of an old friend you haven’t seen in years. You close your eyes, releasing a long, contented breath. The words of your speech feel woven into the very air, wrapping themselves around each person and place.

A gentle hush settles. The lanterns ascend, pulsating one last time before twinkling out of sight. You know this dream will linger long after you awaken, imprinting its wonder in the deepest corners of your mind. Feelings of elation, love, and possibility surge through you, and as you turn back to gaze upon the faces of the crowd, a gentle breeze of recognition and gratitude passes among you.

And in that charged moment—standing in a boundless, ethereal world of swirling lights and crystalline echoes—you awaken, carrying within you the echo of a speech that transcends words, and a vision of a horizon you once believed existed only in dreams.
