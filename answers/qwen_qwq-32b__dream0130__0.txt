I am dreaming. The sleep is warm and velvety, like sinking into a cloud made of starlight.  My limbs dissolve into something liquid, a slow-motion ripple of silver mercury as I drift through a gallery of forgotten memories, each one framed not in wood or metal but in neon light.  The first life I rebuild: a desert planet with twin moons, where my hands sprout cactus spines when I'm nervous.  I build a glass cathedral there, its walls etched with hymns to the silent gods.  But the twin moons pull too hard, and the ground cracks open, swallowing the sanctuary whole.

The second life: a submarine made of bioluminescent whale bones, navigating an ocean with no surface.  I wear a suit that hums with the thoughts of deep-sea jellies.  We map the currents of Lamont's Abyss until the water turns to acid, burning through metal and flesh alike.

Third time, I become a librarian in the Clockwork City ofCTOR7, where every book is a living organism housed in a gilded cage.  I learn their languages, tap their spines to hear stories in binary and cinnamon.  But the city's gears wind down, its citizens scattering like shattered clock parts after a meteor strikes the central solar spire.

Fourth life: a sketched cartoon of a world where I'm a paper-mâché marionette.  My strings are made of stale spaghetti, and I perform slapstick tragedies on a stage of origami.  The curtain call is a thunderous roar—until the audience pelts us withCancel notifications, dissolving the set into confetti static.

Fifth existence: I grow lungs made of nebula gas, harvest stardust in crystalline net, and sail the cosmic highways on a vessel named *The Gravity Breaker*.  We orbit black holes that sing lullabies in x-rays until the ship is shredded by a neutron star's glare.

Now, here I am again.  The sixth downfall.  This time, I'm standing in a prairie of dandelions that sigh when I walk by.  Each stem is a tiny radio, transmitting static and half-heard morse code.  The sky is a tessellation of mirror shards, reflecting thousands of me—all the lives I've lived—each looking back with eyes full of weary defiance.

Before me lies a door made of folded time.  Its handle twists like a double helix.  Behind it, I can hear a voice that's both my own and.  *"This is the last try,"* it murmurs.  *"Or maybe not.  The path diverges here.  Choose a color."*

I close my eyes, feel the hum of possibility.  Red, the color of a setting sun bleeding into a black lake.  Blue, the cerulean scream of a supernova's final breath.  Green, the moss that grows on the teeth of dying volcanoes.

Choosing red.  The door groans open—a desert scene, but the sand is made of crushed glass, each shard a memory.  I sink into it, drawing blood.  The twin moons from my first life hang heavy, but now they're twin eclipses, their pull weaker.  I begin to build anew, a fortress of obsidian and starfish bones, walls etched with forgotten nursery rhymes.

Wait.

The voice returns, a whisper in the dandelion-haze.  *"Not the past.  The future."*  The door snaps shut.  A new path crystallizes: the color of twilight's last shiver, a shade unnamed, impossible to hold in the mind's grip.  The color of promise and regret coiled like twin serpents.

Taking a breath that tastes of iron and sky, I step forward.  The ground becomes a loom, weaving itself into a bridge of tendon and lightning.  Below, infinity yawns—a gaping maw where my clones from all timelines are leaping, screaming, still building, still failing, still dreaming.

Ahead, a figure.  Me.  But leaner, older, eyes like polished jet.  She holds out a hand.  "Let's try something impossible," she says.  Her voice is the click of clockwork, a lullaby, the hiss of helium balloons escaping.  "We’ll build a house that stands in every timeline... even collapse."
