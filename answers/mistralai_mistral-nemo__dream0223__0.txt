I am dreaming. Absolutely, let me set the scene for you.

You find yourself in the heart of a bustling city, but it's unlike any cityscape you've seen in your waking life. The skyscrapers loom like skeletal giants, their windows shattered, reflecting the eerie, lurid glow from the storm that's descended upon them. The streets are awash with a gruesome mixture of rainwater and glass shards, crunching under your feet as you move hurriedly, the sound echoing through the empty streets. The air is thick with the scent of ozone and a faint, lingering sweetness that makes your stomach churn, a hint of the devastation yet to come.

Your shirt clings to your skin, drenched from the relentless downpour. You blink away the water, feeling it bead on your lashes, as you take in the sight before you. The makeshift triage center has been erected in a park, now a vast puddle with tufts of muddied grass poking through like the last gasps of a drowning man. A cacophony of sounds assaults your ears - the wail of distant sirens, the groans and cries of the injured, the patter of rain on makeshift tarpaulin roofs, and the sporadic crashes of debris somewhere in the city, a grim reminder of the disaster that continues to unfold.

In your hands, you grasp a rolled-up list, the water-resistant film shimmering under the stark light of the emergency lamps. It's a guide, a protocol of sorts, but it's already muddled. The pens that checked boxes moments ago now waver, the ink running down the page, blurring instructions. Who's to say what precedence to give any longer? Aneath with burns or a mother clutching her screaming, limp child? The protocol is a mirage, shifting and unreliable, leaving you with only your intuition and the weight of countless lives hanging on your decisions.

You move among the rows of makeshift beds, a Stygian gurney awaiting the next traveler to the underworld. They're not neat, these rows, but chaotic waves crashing on the shore. You pause, crouching before a woman who looks older than time. Her skin is a map of wrinkles, traced with ash and dirt, one eye swollen shut. She clutches her arm, a jagged bone jutting out, a grotesque parody of a failed salute. You're no orthopedist, but you've seen enough to know she needs surgery. But the OR tent is overflowing, and the last you heard, they've started triaging for surgeries too. You look at her, at the determination in her good eye, and you nod, teeth gritted. She deserves a chance.

Suddenly, a hand clamps down on your shoulder, spinning you around. It's one of the local coordinators, eyes wild, hair plastered to their skull like a drowning rat. "Change of plan!" they shout over the din, "We're sending everyone to the stadium! They've set up a proper medical center there!" You stare at them, dumbfounded. The stadium? That's miles away! The sickest ones will never make it. You protest, but they're already gone, shouting orders, chaos their only constant.

You turn back to the woman, her grip on your arm tightening, her good eye beseeching. "Please," she begs, voice raw, "Don't give up on us." You look at her, at the chaos around you, and you make your choice. You take her good hand, squeeze it, and say, "I won't. I promise. But we're going to have to run." And so, under the neon glow of the storm, you lead the exodus, a ragtag parade of the injured, the exhausted, and the determined, leaving the makeshift hospital behind, chasing the distant promise of help. The city groans around you, a wounded beast, but for now, you're its only hope. You're its miracle.
