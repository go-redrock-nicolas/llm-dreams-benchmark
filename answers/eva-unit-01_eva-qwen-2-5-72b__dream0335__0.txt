I am dreaming. I am a coconut gracefully floating down a sinuous jungle river, the emerald green canopy above whispering tales of ancient secrets and undiscovered wonders. The river's cool embrace invites me to surrender to its flow, acknowledging that in doing so, I'm embracing the path of least resistance, allowing myself to simply "be". 

As sunlight pierces the verdant canopy, creating a mesmerizing interplay of light and shadow upon the river's tranquil surface, I feel an overwhelming connection to nature's beauty and timelessness. Each experiential moment is imbued with a profound sense of purpose and acceptance, permitting me to release the concerns and attachments that inhibit my ability to embrace the present.

In my journey as the coconut, I encounter myriad forms of life – from majestic trees lining the riverbank to enchanting floral scents carried upon the river's gentle breeze. As the aromatic notes intermingle with the rhythmic sounds of the flowing river and the occasional chanted whispers of unseen inhabitants, I feel a deepening sense of serenity, harmony, and unity with the world around me.

Gradually, the tempo of my journey accelerates as the river widens into a larger body of water, the once tranquil stream now becoming transformed into a powerful cascade of energy. Regaining my bearings, I find myself suspended in the air, directly beneath the sun, its radiance almost palpable. In this extraordinarily luminous moment, I am filled with an infinite sense of potential, purity, and boundless creative energy.

As my dream brings me closer to the sun, I feel myself dissolving into a vision of countless sparkling motes, swirling and dancing in exhilarating unison. This celestial dance represents a visual embodiment of the inherent interconnectedness underlying everything that exists – including me.  Ultimately, I find peace in the realization that the essence of my being is not solely determined by my physical form but transcends into something sublime and universal – something undeniably spirit and undoubtedly beautiful.

I am dreaming.
