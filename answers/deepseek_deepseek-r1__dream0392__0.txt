I am dreaming. You stand at the nexus of the three glowing portals, the telepathic hum crescendoing into a symphony of whispers that seem to pull at the seams of your soul. The amber gateway flickers like a trapped wildfire, its heat licking your face with promises of both destruction and rebirth. The teal portal spirals inward, a liquid vortex where seconds unravel into centuries, and the violet one pulses with an electric stillness, like the breath held before a lightning strike. The voice—now less a sound and more a vibration in your marrow—urges you forward: *“Each fracture is a threshold. To mend, you must first shatter.”*

You choose the amber portal.  
Heat swallows you whole.  
A desert of glass stretches endlessly, each grain singing a different memory—your first heartbreak, a childhood fear, a lie you’ve buried. The air shimmers with mirages: versions of yourself as a storm-chaser, a hermit, a martyr, all burning at the edges. A shadowy figure materializes, its form a mosaic of your own face fractured across time. It speaks in crackling embers: *“What will you burn to stay alive?”* You reach into the flames, and your hands blister with truths you’ve refused to speak. The desert implodes, glass melting into liquid gold that stitches the sky back together.  

The teal portal next.  
You plunge into an inverted ocean where cities float like jellyfish, their skyscrapers dissolving into schools of luminescent fish. Time loops—a conversation you regret spirals backward, your mother’s laughter unspools into a baby’s cry, your own reflection ages and un-ages in the glassy deep. The shadow here is a liquid thing, a current dragging you toward a whirlpool of “what ifs.” It murmurs through coral teeth: *“What will you release to stop drowning?”* You exhale a breath full of clenched fists and unfinished apologies. The water stills. Cities bloom into bioluminescent forests, roots knitting the seafloor’s cracks.  

The violet portal swallows you last.  
Silence. Absolute.  
You float in a starless void where gravity is a forgotten myth. Here, the shadow is not a shape but a pressure—the weight of every unsung dream, every stifled scream. It interrogates without words: *What will you voice to escape the hush?* Your tongue heavy with decades of silence, you utter a sound that isn’t a word but a color, a scent, a childhood hymn. The void shatters like a mirror, releasing a supernova of fireflies that carry the galaxies’ lost whispers.  

Back in the cavern, the three shadows converge, their fragments merging into a being of shimmering obsidian and light. *“You’ve carried splinters of yourself in parallel worlds,”* it intones, voice now your own. The humming crescendos as you step into the merging figure, cold and heat colliding in your veins. The cavern’s crystals explode into a rain of liquid prism—each droplet a tiny portal, a tiny life, a tiny death.  

You wake.  
Your skin hums.  
Dawn filters through your window, but the light bends strangely, briefly, into the colors of a healed fracture.
