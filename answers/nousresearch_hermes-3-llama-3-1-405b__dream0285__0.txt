I am dreaming. The fluorescent lights buzz like bees above us as I sit, tense, at the long, ovular conference table. It is littered with joe-ringed print-outs and blinking devices.   The room is packed---mostly older people, men and women in suits, some in polo shirts, each with an opinion, each loudly voiced; the atmosphere is one of cacophonous, self-important heat.  I can hardly bear it.  I was called to this meeting, though I was hardly invited.  I am here to offer my opinion, though it is increasingly clear that nobody wants to hear it.

Around me, they all seem to agree, having reached a troubled consensus to which everyone can resign themselves.  They have been volleying with reasons and excuses for nearly half an hour now, having nearly convinced themselves entirely with back-patting and grim nods.  These are the plans they have, and they will come to fruition, they know---the consequences will have to simply be dealt with.  Their industry will march on, undaunted. 

But I can see now that there is another way, a clear solution to this problem, for which nobody here has any time or attention.  And I know that I must speak---there is a window now, as this throbbing mass of conversation slurs and diverts itself for just a moment, and I now have the chance to interject, to slice the momentum of the conversation towards the path that I know is ultimately right.

My heart pounds like the pistons of an engine as my thoughts coalesce into words, and in my mind, they struggle to form an utterance. I try to control my breath, to project my voice, to find the tone of confidence that would sound like that of a leader, a co-conspirator in the plan we hatch here today, not that of a dissenting voice, not of an 'other.'  My eyes attempt in vain to meet those of all in the room for consent, for encouragement, finding only doubtful curiosity.

I start to speak and the room falls silent. To my surprise, it remains so as I lay out my argument, and slowly surprise turns to intrigue, and intrigue to a reluctant but undeniable agreement.  I have convinced them!  I have changed the course of history here, in this room, in one paragraph's worth of speech---and now our industries will march forth with minimal damage, and all will be well.

The corners of the room wobble now as the air seems to shimmer around me; the air conditioner kicks on, sending a flickering wave through the lights above us.  The walls hum to life, their colors becoming two-dimensional, cartoonish, obviating falseness.  The faces around me disintegrate as the room crumbles like cheap styrofoam, like clods of dirt in a storm.  I blink and I am elsewhere, the place of decisions banished, vaulted back into some dusty storeroom of the mind.

My surroundings are now manifestly surreal, a smooth geometry of gem-like mountains, the colors bright, toylike, prismatic, and I know that I am in another realm---half-conjured from true memory, and half the logic of dreamspace.  These peaks sway in space as though they were made of some airy substance, shifting both in color and shape as they move. 

At my feet are candles, altar candles, and I know that I must light them now to escape this indistinct, featureless void.  I strike a match and the first ignites, its ember apparent for just a moment before winking out of existence. So I light another, and another, until I have as many points of cadmium light as there are stars. Surely now I will return to the world...but I remain here, static, stuck, lost in a place with neither shadow nor substance. 

I am dreaming, and I know this---but as the wax drips onto my hands, as the smoke stings my eyes, as the pressure grows within my chest, I can feel nothing but the report of my nerves, the truth of my emotions.  In my mind, it is all real.
