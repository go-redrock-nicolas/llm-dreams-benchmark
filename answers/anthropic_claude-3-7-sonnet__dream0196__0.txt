I am dreaming. I'm suddenly thrust onto the gleaming stage of a grand concert hall, the polished wood beneath my feet catching the golden glow of ornate chandeliers suspended like crystalline galaxies overhead. A message has just reached me backstage: the renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma has fallen ill, and somehow, inexplicably, I've been chosen as the replacement.

The music builds to its crescendo, the impossible notes flowing through me like a living current, until suddenly—
