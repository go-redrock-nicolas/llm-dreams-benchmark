I am dreaming. You drift upward through a forest of singing vines whose leaves refract starlight like scattered jewels. Each step you take makes the ground ripple outward in concentric waves, revealing mirrored ponds filled not with water but with memories you’ve never lived. In these reflections, your face tilts and shifts—sometimes young and curious, other times ancient and knowing—and you realize you’re chasing a feeling that never quite shows itself in full.

Far above, the sky has the color of half-remembered rainbows. You reach out to catch one of its hues, but it slips through your fingers like silk smoke. In its place, a new shade blooms on your palm—neither joy nor sorrow, but something that trembles between them. You try to name it, to pin it with language, but the words unravel like threads of dream. So you cradle it in your chest and let it pulse there, a tiny lantern for the indescribable.

A sudden wind rises, carrying the scent of molten glass and sugar. It sweeps you along a ribbon of mist that coils through floating arches of coral—arches that hum with the echoes of unspoken thoughts. As you pass beneath each arch, you attempt to speak your hidden feeling aloud. Your voice fractures into crystalline notes, scattering into the vault of sky. Those notes gather, swirling into a spiraling helix of light and shadow, each twist a syllable your tongue can’t form.

Finally, you stand before a vast mirror framed by living branches. The feeling you’ve been carrying now shines in the glass as a small, opalescent sphere suspended midair. You whisper toward it, and though no familiar word emerges, the sphere trembles and shatters into a million motes of glowing dust. They drift back into your ribs, where they settle like stardust in a hollow cavern. You wake—though in dreams, “waking” is just another shade of dreaming—and carry that silent constellation of particles with you, the perfect name for a feeling that has no name at all.
