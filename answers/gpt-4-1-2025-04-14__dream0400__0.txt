I am dreaming.

In this otherworldly vision, I am bodiless—no walls of skin or skeleton bind me. My awareness spills outward, flowing like a river merging with streams, brooks, and oceans. I drift in an infinite, luminous ocean woven from the thoughts and feelings of every soul that has ever lived. My mind is not my own—it is a shimmering braid, wound around and through all the others.

Every sigh of sorrow, every burst of joy, every moment of simple presence pulses through me as if the feelings were my own. My "I" becomes "we." In this vast, synesthetic chorus, colors sing and music shimmers in radiant patterns. I can taste laughter—it's a violet fizz on my tongue. Grief feels cool and blue, smooth as glass under my fingertips. Somewhere, a stranger dreams of an ancient forest, and I am dappled in gold-green light, leaves trembling above me.

The barriers between people dissolve into the thinnest mist. I sense the trembling hope of a child, the weathered wonder of an old woman, the quiet devotion of a painter finishing his life's work by candlelight. With every breath, I expand, merging and mingling, wrapped in a gentle understanding, deeper than words. Here, in this shared dreamspace, every life—including my own—is a note in a cosmic melody, every separation an illusion revealed by the dawn.

Within that unity, there is peace, laughter, sorrow, love. I awake not as myself alone, but as a single, glowing thread in the endless tapestry of being.
