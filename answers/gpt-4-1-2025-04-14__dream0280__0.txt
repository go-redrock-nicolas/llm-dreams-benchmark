I am dreaming. find yourself wandering through a lush, otherworldly forest, where the canopy above glows with bioluminescent leaves and whispering breezes carry the scent of wildflowers unknown to waking life. Sunbeams weave through the emerald shadows, illuminating patches of moss that feel softer than velvet beneath your bare feet.

In the heart of this forest, you come upon a clearing, crystalline dew glinting on the grass. There sits a figure, cloaked in the colors of dawn—gentle pinks and molten gold—eyes reflecting the starlight caught in the treetops. Their presence is instantly familiar, as if you’ve known them across lifetimes. Their voice, when they speak, is gentle and musical, harmonizing with the distant trill of an unseen nightingale.

As you sit together, time seems to slow, the boundaries between reality and dream dissolving. With each shared word, with each soft sigh and lingering glance, they peel back layers of their being. First, they confide their hopes, whispered dreams that flutter between you like delicate butterflies. Then, with trembling hands, they reveal old wounds—fragile as the wings of a moth, marked by sorrow and resilience. You see in their truths the tapestry of a soul: joys stitched beside grief, laughter nestled in the folds of longing.

You listen, heart wide open, as the world grows quiet around you. Vulnerability draws you closer, threads of trust weaving an invisible bridge. Their secrets become lanterns, lighting your path deeper into their heart. In return, you feel your own truths rising from within, unbidden and radiant, ready to be received.

Together, you sit in wordless understanding, the clearing alive with possibility. You realize that in this dream, trust is not just given but grown, flowering silently in the darkness between you, filling the night air with the sweet, ancient scent of belonging.
