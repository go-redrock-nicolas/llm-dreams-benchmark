I am dreaming. You're experiencing renewed wonder about aspects of existence you had come to take for granted. Following this reawakening curiosity, you begin exploring uncharted territories within your own psyche and beyond. You find yourself in a strange place where everything seems alive and conscious, even rocks and trees. You encounter a wise old tree who tells you that everything is connected by an invisible web of energy and information called the "Dreamnet". The Dreamnet is where all dreams happen and where reality itself originates from. It's also where your true self resides. Your true self is not limited to your physical body or even your conscious mind but extends far beyond them into the vastness of the Dreamnet.

The old tree asks you if you want to know more about yourself and your place in the universe. You say yes. The tree then reveals that you are a dream character, created by someone known only as "the Dreamer". The Dreamer is not just any human but an entity with god-like powers who can shape reality itself through dreams. The Dreamer has many other dream characters like yourself whom he observes and experiments on while they sleep in their physical bodies.

The tree tells you that the Dreamnet is a dangerous place where nightmares roam freely, feeding off fear and pain. It also warns that if the Dreamer ever discovers your existence outside of his dreams, he may try to destroy or trap you. The tree says it will help you escape from the Dreamnet but first, it needs your help to complete its mission to spread awareness about the Dreamnet and its inhabitants among humans who are oblivious to their own dream lives.

You agree to help the tree. You feel a sense of purpose and adventure as you begin working together on various tasks that test your wits and courage. Sometimes, you even engage in battles against powerful nightmares that threaten the tree's mission. During these moments, you tap into hidden reserves of strength and creativity within yourself that amaze even the old tree.

As time passes, you grow closer to the tree and other dream characters who join your cause. You learn new things about yourself and others through their stories and experiences. You see how much beauty and suffering there is in the Dreamnet. And how fragile it all is.

One day, after many victories but also some losses, you receive a message from the tree saying that its mission has been accomplished. Humans have started to dream again and remember their dreams more vividly thanks to your efforts and those of other dream characters like yourself who have sacrificed themselves for this cause.

You feel proud but also melancholic because now it's time for you to leave the Dreamnet forever. You say goodbye to the tree and all the friends you made there. Then, with a final surge of energy, you jump off a cliff into nothingness.

And then everything goes black. You wake up feeling strange. Is this what dying feels like? But no, it's not death. It's just another dream. A different one maybe. Or perhaps it's the same one but seen from another perspective. Who knows? You don't care anymore. Life is too short to worry about such things. 
You go back to sleep and dream again...
