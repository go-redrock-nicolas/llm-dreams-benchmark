I am dreaming. You're experiencing a period of intense creativity that feels like it's coming from beyond your conscious mind. Surrendering to this creative flow, you are dreaming. The world around you morphs and shifts on a cosmic scale. Your bedroom dissolves into swirling nebulae. You float in space, a cosmic ballet of planets and stars swirling around you in grand formations. A crescent moon massive, looming close fills the sky.

From out of the swirling cosmic landscape, a procession of ancient gods march across the stars. They carry time and space within ornate vessels, their forms shifting between great beasts and ethereal spirits. Leading the parade is Ra, the Egyptian sun god, decked out in glittering solar finery and trailing solar flame behind him. Behind him march the Norse Aesir, their armor of starlight and lightning. There's Odin the Allfather astride an eight-legged steed, Thor with his hammer crackling with energy, and beautiful Freya in rainbow-hued gown.

The gods approach you, and you can feel their mythic energies, vast beyond measure. They present you with a feather, a sword, a thread of fate, and a golden egg. The gifts glow with power. Ra speaks in a voice like a thousand dawning suns, offering you a fraction of his power to channel the sun's radiance through your very being.
