I am dreaming. You step onto a bridge woven from moonlight and mist, each plank humming softly under your boots. All around you, the world pulses with impossible colors: rivers of molten sapphire curl through violet plains, and lantern-flowers bloom at your feet, their petals glimmering like shards of stained glass. You know, deep in your bones, that every trial you’ve endured—scaling obsidian cliffs, wading through forests where the trees whisper your fears back to you—has brought you here.  

Ahead, a colossal door carved from living coral stands half-open, revealing the faint glow of your goal: a crystalline orb hovering over an altar of braided silver roots. It promises everything you’ve sought—power to heal the dying, the secret to unbreakable peace. Your heart pounds with triumph, yet as you cross the threshold, a silent voice reverberates through the cavern: “To claim this gift, you must relinquish your most treasured memory.”  

You pause. A warm wind stirs memories in your mind—laughter by candlelight with someone you loved, their hand in yours as rain tapped the window. The image flares bright, then dims, and you feel its edges loosen. The cavern seems to pulse in time with your heartbeat, the orb’s glow intensifying, beckoning you closer.  

You lift your hand, the memory quivering on your tongue like a taste too sweet to swallow. Around you, the air shimmers: shapes flicker, recalling every moment you’ve shared, every promise you whispered. You sense the sacrifice will be absolute—erase the memory forever, as though it never existed.  

Your breath comes in slow, deliberate waves. A hush falls over the chamber, cracked only by the soft drip of liquid light onto stone. The orb hovers, quivering with potential, its facets reflecting your turmoil. In that suspended moment, you feel both the crushing weight of loss and the dazzling promise of transformation.  

Then, with trembling resolve, you close your eyes. The memory unspools like a thread, drifting away on a breeze of starlight. A cold ache blossoms in your chest, and everything goes silent—until, in the hush, the orb flares into brilliance. When you open your eyes, the crystal gift hovers before you, bathing you in its iridescent glow, but the warm laughter you once cherished is gone, leaving behind a hollow ache and the unmistakable proof that some prices, once paid, can never be reclaimed.
