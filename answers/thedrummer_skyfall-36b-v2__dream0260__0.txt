I am dreaming. As the devastating news sinks in, you feel a tidal wave of emotions threatening to crash over you, threatening to shatter the facade of composure you desperately try to maintain. In your mind's eye, you see yourself standing at the edge of a vast, swirling vortex of emotions. The tempest rages around you, the wind howling with the cries of your sorrow and the thunderous rumble of your anger.

You take a deep breath, a delicate thread of determination still defiantly aloft in the gusts battering you, and you begin to climb downward into the chasm.

As you descend, the darkness engulfs you, black and oppressive, but you press on. Suddenly, a glimmer of light appears, a faint, ethereal radiance that seems to beckon you forward. You follow it, navigating the treacherous terrain with a combination of caution and resolve.

The light grows brighter, and you find yourself in a surreal, dreamlike landscape. The ground beneath your feet is soft and spongy, as if made of clouds. Strangely shaped trees with leaves that shimmer in iridescent hues stretch towards a sky that seems to blend seamlessly into the horizon.

A gentle breeze caresses your face, carrying with it the faintest whispers of guidance and comfort. You feel a strange sense of peace wash over you, even as the storm of emotions still rages in the distance. 

You spot a small, crystal-clear pool of water, its surface mirroring the twinkling stars speckling the sky above. As you approach, you see your reflection staring back at you, but it's not quite your own face. The eyes are older, wiser, carrying the weight of a profound understanding.

The reflection begins to speak, its voice soft yet commanding: "To maintain your composure in the face of such trials, you must first embrace the storm within you. Let it course through your veins, feel its power, but do not let it drown you. Rise above it, but do not let it pass. Rise above it, but do not be consumed."

The reflection reaches out a ghostly hand, and you feel a surge of strength flow into you. You understand, in that moment, that you possess the incredible strength within yourself to weather this storm and still emerge firm.

As you wake up from the dream, you carry with you the determination to face the world, knowing that you have the power within yourself to navigate through the darkest of times.
