I am dreaming. You are driving along a winding, scenic highway, the kind that overlooks expansive valleys and dense forests. The road is swathed in golden sunlight, with a slight breeze tousling your hair, and the roaring engine of your car feels visceral, almost mechanical in its rhythm. It’s a perfect day for a drive.

Suddenly, the brakes fail. 

At first, it’s a subtle catch—a hesitation in the pedal beneath your foot. But then, nothing. You press harder, and there's no response, no give. As the car picks up speed, your heart lurches into your throat. The forest rushes past in a blur, towering trees looming like sentinels threatening to devour you. Traffic is ahead—a cluster of cars, each one an obstacle you must navigate with increasing desperation.

Adrenaline surges through you like electricity. You jolt for the handbrake, pulling it back with a roar, but it's jammed. You try to downshift, but the gears grind uselessly. Panic wells up as you realize the sheer helplessness of the situation. The road seems impossibly narrow, treacherous.

The cars in front come into sharp, terrifying focus. You can't avoid them. You can't stop. The margins for error are vanishingly small. You feel the weight of every little miscalculation as you swerve, your palms slick with sweat. You realize there’s only one grim possibility: the crash.

And it's terrifyingly inevitable.

The wind screams in your ears, the engine wails, and the moment stretches, elongated and surreal. Everything outside that car becomes irrelevant. Everything except the immediate terror of the collision barreling toward you. Your heart races. You are breathless.

An endless, almost cinematic sunset stretches across the horizon, revealing an irony: even in the presence of supreme beauty, your mind is consumed by the chaos within. The car just keeps moving.

Suddenly, the dream shifts. You open your eyes. You're still alive—no crash, no collision. The car has stopped. You're unsure if you woke up by choice or if the dream ended on its own. It leaves you questioning: was it a metaphor? What did it mean? Or was it just a figment of your subconscious mind?

The dream fades, leaving only the lingering thud of your heartbeat. But deep in the recesses of your mind, something whispers—maybe the dream isn't over just yet. Maybe it's still playing out, just beyond your waking consciousness.
