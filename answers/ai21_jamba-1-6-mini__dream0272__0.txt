I am dreaming. The dream begins with a sensation of weightlessness, as if you're floating in a vast, empty space. The environment around you is dark, with only faint, elusive pinpricks of light resembling distant stars. Gradually, the dreamscape materializes into a sprawling, ancient city enveloped in fog. The buildings are grand, with intricate carvings and towering spires that reach the misty sky, but they seem half-forgotten, as if they are decaying before your very eyes.

The fog begins to dissipate, revealing the populace of the city. There are people of all ages and walks of life, bustling through the streets with an air of hurried urgency. They are unaware of your presence, and yet, they all seem to be expecting someone—someone who can guide them, someone who can bring order to their chaos.

You become aware of a subtle, powerful force urging you to step forward. The people's gaze follows this invisible direction, and they look to you without even knowing it. Startled but strangely compelled, you begin to walk. Every step feels heavy yet purposeful, as though your legs are moving of their own accord.

As you walk, the details of the city become sharper. You see the faces of the people—they are weary but hopeful. They carry the weight of responsibility on their shoulders, yet they seem to have lost their way. The buildings begin to repair themselves as you move, stone chips reassembling, paint refreshing, and the general atmosphere becomes lighter.

Suddenly, the fog parts to reveal a grand, ornate structure at the end of the main boulevard. It is a library of sorts, with towering shelves of books and scrolls reaching the heavens, doors guarded by statues in the shape of wise, seated figures. The doors open as you approach, and you are encased in a warm, golden light.

The dream shifts. You are sitting at a massive table carved with intricate designs, surrounded by the misty, semitransparent forms of otherworldly figures. They advise you, their words echoing in your mind with a weight that makes them clear even as they fade.

You realize that you are tasked with a great decision. The city is in peril, its people suffering from a growing darkness that threatens to engulf it. The images fade, and you feel the urgency press upon you. You must choose.

The dream becomes fragmented, a whirlwind of faces and voices, each calling for your attention, each pleading for guidance. You can feel the weight of their expectation, the sheer need for something—anything—to set them free from the encroaching darkness.

As you feel the dream getting more tense, you are given a choice: will you take the risk and lead, or remain hidden and let fate take its course? The decision presses, and the dream edges towards its climax, the pressure growing as you hesitate.
