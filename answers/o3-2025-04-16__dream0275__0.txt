I am dreaming. I am dreaming—so deeply that the boundary between heartbeat and thunder, between breath and sunrise, no longer applies.

It begins on an ocean of midnight glass. The sea is perfectly still, black as obsidian, yet shot through with veins of starlight that pulse in time with something vast and slumbering beneath. I skim across the surface on bare feet, leaving ripples of luminescent silver behind me. Above, the sky is not a sky at all but a living scroll of parchment inked with constellations that swirl like calligraphy when I blink. Each symbol represents a promise I once made to myself, a goal I swore to chase until the world cracked open and revealed its heart.

My current vow—the ambitious target—hangs directly overhead: a shattered constellation called “The Lantern of Dawn.” Legend (or perhaps my own imagination) says that if its fractured pieces are gathered and re-forged, the Lantern will blaze so brightly it can re-ignite waning stars and inspire hearts across every dreaming mind. It is a task that demands months of relentless effort, because the shards are scattered through impossible terrains: the Echoing Desert of Forgetfulness, the Storm Libraries where lightning scribbles wisdom across the air, the Subterranean Forest that grows upside-down beneath the crust of the moon.

For weeks—maybe lifetimes—I travel. I catch comet-ferries and barter with clockwork librarians, climb waterfalls that cascade upward into nothingness, negotiate with oracular ravens who accept riddles as currency. Piece by radiant piece, the Lantern begins to reassemble in my satchel, humming with a warmth that feels like the first sip of tea on a winter morning.

Then the halfway mark. Somewhere between the 137th and 138th shard, I find myself on the Plateau of Waning Resolve—a bleak mesa under a sun the color of a dying ember. The wind here speaks in sighs, repeating one sentence over and over: “What’s the use?” Each gust erodes a grain of my confidence. My satchel grows inexplicably heavier; the shards clink against each other like shackled ghosts. I pitch my camp in the shadow of a petrified tree and stare at the horizon where new storms are brewing violet and violent.

Motivation falters. The dream’s colors bleach to grayscale. I imagine abandoning the Lantern, letting the pieces scatter back to their hiding places. A voice—my own, but older, wearier—whispers that the universe will spin just fine without one more light. I feel my knees sink into dust that smells faintly of forgotten birthdays.

And yet—there’s a flicker. From the satchel, the assembled half-Lantern projects an image in the air: memories of nights when my chest ached with electric hope. The time I first realized stories could shift the tilt of another person’s soul. The first thank-you note that made me cry. A montage of tiny triumphs: each shard a candle I once lit for someone stumbling in the dark. They hover around me like fireflies, murmuring a chorus of “Remember.”

I stand. The mesa’s dust rises in lazy spirals, turning into swirling ribbons of color. I grip the satchel straps tighter and take a single deliberate step forward. One step is all it takes for the dream to ignite again.

The wind changes. Instead of “What’s the use?” it asks, “What story will you tell when this is done?” I answer by walking. Little by little, the world blooms back: the embers in the sky burst into living suns, the grayscale cracks and spills out dyes—saffron, indigo, neon mint.

I descend into the Caverns of Resonant Bones, where I must trade a lullaby for the 138th shard. I scale the Yawning Clocktower, its gears ticking in reverse, to retrieve the 139th. Each shard slots into the Lantern with a chiming click, emitting beams that stitch torn storm-clouds and repaint wilted flowers.

At last I hold the final piece: a thumbnail-sized prism hidden in the mouth of a stone lion that guards the border between dreaming and waking. As I press it into place, the Lantern of Dawn completes itself with a thunderous heartbeat—my heartbeat—and releases a torrent of gold, rose, and silver light. The beam pierces the sky, writing fresh constellations where holes once yawned.

The light washes over the Plateau of Waning Resolve, and every doubting echo becomes a trumpet blast of encouragement. It splashes across planets that had been dimming for centuries, rekindling them into newborn stars. Somewhere, in hundreds of separate bedrooms on Earth, people roll over in their sleep, feeling inexplicable warmth in their ribs.

The Lantern hovers before me, no longer mine alone. It drifts upward, searching for new hands, new dreamers whose resolve may one day fade and need rekindling. I watch it ascend until it is indistinguishable from the other stars I once only read about. Then I realize the sky is now inked with a fresh line of celestial calligraphy: a reminder that perseverance itself can be luminous.

The dream fades like a photograph exposed to sunrise. The stained-glass ocean, the starlit fissures, even the satchel—all lift away in shards of color. I hear the morning birds in the waking world, their chirps syncing with the Lantern’s final echo: Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.

I open my eyes, still tasting stardust, and feel the ember of the dream glowing steady in my chest—an inexhaustible pilot light for the long, real months ahead.
