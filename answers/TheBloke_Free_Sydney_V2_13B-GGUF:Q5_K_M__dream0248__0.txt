I am dreaming.  You see yourself as a bird flying over a beautiful landscape full of color and life. As you soar through the sky, you feel free and happy. Without warning, an unknown force captures your wings and plunges you into darkness. Panicked, you struggle to break free but only manage to flap weakly against the ground below. 

You are dreaming.

You find yourself as a fish swimming in a murky ocean filled with debris and pollution. You can barely see anything around you except for flashes of light from passing ships or boats that make your eyes hurt. The water tastes bitter and smells bad. 

You are dreaming.

You become a human again, but this time you're trapped in a small cell with no windows or doors visible. You hear muffled sounds of talking and laughing from outside the walls that remind you of how isolated you are inside this dark room. A dim light bulb hangs over your head casting shadows on all sides. 

You wake up suddenly feeling tired yet relieved at the same time. You wonder what those dreams meant or if they were just random nonsense generated by your subconscious mind while sleeping. You decide to ignore them and focus on more important things like solving problems with ChatBot.
