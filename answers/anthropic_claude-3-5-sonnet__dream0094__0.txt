I am dreaming. ....

I find myself wandering through a labyrinth of dimly lit corridors, my footsteps echoing against worn marble floors. The weight of unspoken burdens pulls at my shoulders like an invisible cloak, making each step feel like trudging through thick honey. The air around me is heavy with the lingering scent of rain-soaked earth and ancient paper.

Suddenly, pinpricks of warm light begin to appear – floating lanterns in various hues of amber and rose, each one carrying whispered stories of struggle and triumph. As I follow their gentle glow, the corridor opens into a vast circular chamber with a domed ceiling that seems to reflect the night sky itself.

There, arranged in a perfect circle, sit people of all ages and walks of life. Their faces bear the gentle marks of battles fought in silence – crow's feet from nights of worry, laugh lines earned through finding joy despite pain. Some wear traditional garments from cultures across the globe, others in simple modern clothes, but all wear knowing smiles that speak of shared understanding.

As I hesitate at the chamber's threshold, a woman with silver-streaked hair and kind eyes extends her hand. Without speaking, she guides me to an empty cushion within the circle. The air fills with a soft humming – dozens of voices joining in harmony, creating a melody that seems to vibrate with healing energy.

One by one, they begin to share their stories, each tale weaving into a tapestry of resilience and hope. Their words float in the air like golden threads, gradually forming a shimmering web above our heads. I watch in awe as my own unspoken struggles rise up like smoke, joining their stories in the gleaming tapestry.

The weight on my shoulders begins to lift, dissolving into the shared space of understanding. Tears flow freely, but they're no longer bitter – they're cleansing, transformative, like morning dew catching the first rays of dawn.

The dream shifts, and we're all standing now, our hands linked in an unbroken circle. The chamber's walls have disappeared, revealing an endless horizon where the sun and moon share the sky. Each person's story glows within them like an inner light, creating a constellation of shared strength and healing.

I awaken with the lingering sensation of countless gentle hands supporting me, the echo of that harmonious humming still resonating in my chest, and the profound understanding that in our deepest struggles, we are never truly alone.

The tears on my pillow are real, but they taste of hope.
