I am dreaming. Let me share it with you.

I stand on the edge of a forest carved not from trees, but swirling columns of kaleidoscopic light—colors that don't exist in the waking world, flowing and flickering like thoughts just beyond the edge of memory. Each pillar pulses gently, as if breathing, casting shifting patterns on the glistening obsidian ground beneath my bare feet. The air smells of cinnamon and forgotten lullabies, thick and sweet and vibrating.

Above, the sky boils with planets that drift too close to one another, brushing atmospheres like lovers. Stars blink in Morse code, sending messages I almost, *almost* understand—until I try to focus, and they slip away like dream logic itself. There are cities suspended in the air without support, made of windows peering into countless different possibilities. Behind one, I see a version of myself riding a mechanized panther through deserts of sugar dust. Behind another, I am married to the night, wearing a cloak stitched from hours and silence.

In this dream, nothing is simple. Time folds itself like origami. A child near me laughs while holding a snake wrapped around her arm like a ribbon. The snake speaks, not in words but in feelings—nostalgia, discomfort, belonging—illustrating nuances I couldn't articulate even if I had a thousand waking lifetimes. 

To my left, a river flows upward, carrying books that rewrite themselves as they pass through the air. One opens near me: illustrations shifting from war to peace to something neither, pages stained with the ink of dualities—love that hurts, cruelty that heals, truth that lies. I reach out and touch a floating verse—it burns like realization and soothes like absolution.

Everything here is paradox, but nothing feels impossible.

This dream no longer allows me to see the world as merely right or wrong, black or white, good or evil. Beneath the surface of each being, each moment, is a galaxy of intent and consequence. As I watch an enormous clock melt into a field of butterflies, I begin to **get it**—things can be beautiful and broken at the same time. I can be wrong and wise in the same breath.

The deeper parts of my imagination whisper: **the truth is never clean, but it is always sacred.**

And in that whisper, I awaken—not with answers—but with awe.
