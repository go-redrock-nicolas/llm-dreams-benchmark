I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a vast atrium, the ceiling so high it disappears into swirling mist. Two massive oak tables face each other across a no-man's land of polished obsidian floor that reflects everything like dark water. The air feels electrically charged, heavy with unspoken accusations and decades of competitive history.

To my left stands Valencia, her silver suit catching blue light from tall windows. Her team sits behind her in perfect formation, each member's posture mirroring her confident stance. Their silver and sapphire insignias gleam with cold precision. Valencia's eyes meet mine with the intensity of someone who has mentored me through countless challenges, her slight nod reminding me of debts unpaid and promises whispered in late-night strategy sessions.

To my right, Kieran lounges against his table's edge, his casual posture belying the power he commands. His team sprawls in calculated disorder, their crimson and gold attire vibrant against the room's solemnity. Kieran's smile carries warmth that reminds me of laughter shared over unexpected victories, his gaze holding the weight of secrets we've protected together.

Between them lies a holographic model of what could be our greatest achievement – a shimmering city that pulses with potential, its architecture impossible without both teams' unique innovations. The project that could transform millions of lives, now suspended in this liminal space of pride and distrust.

Both leaders subtly turn toward me, their movements drawing their teams' attention like magnets aligning iron filings. The air thickens. My heartbeat echoes in my ears as I realize they aren't just expecting my allegiance – they're waiting for me to choose which vision will shape this dream into reality.

Words form on my tongue, but before I can speak, the floor beneath me begins to transform, the obsidian becoming transparent, revealing depths below where earlier collaborations shine like buried treasures – reminders of what's possible when rivalries are transcended...
