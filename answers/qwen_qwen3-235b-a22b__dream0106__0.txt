I am dreaming. …step forward. Your feet barely touch the trembling bridge of light, each plank a flickering filament of gold, as if the sun itself has been spun into thread. The crowd behind you fades into a chorus of whispers, their faces melting into the glassy skyline—a city of towers that hum with forgotten songs, their surfaces rippling like liquid mirrors. Above, the sky is not a sky but a roiling tapestry of indigo and molten copper, constellations blinking in and out of existence like the thoughts of a god losing interest.  

The beast looms closer. Its gears grind with a sound like tectonic plates colliding, and its eyes—twin prisms of shattered time—reflect moments that haven’t happened yet. You see yourself in those eyes: falling, burning, laughing, becoming ash, becoming wings. Its maw yawns open, revealing not teeth but tiny galaxies spiraling in endless hunger.  

You run.  

Not away, but *toward*. The bridge dissolves beneath your feet, yet you keep moving, each step conjuring a new platform of shimmering obsidian that evaporates behind you. The air tastes of ozone and elderflowers. You leap, not upward, but *sideways* into the beast’s shadow, where gravity forgets its rules and your body stretches into a ribbon of light. Its claws swipe through you, but you are smoke now, then a flock of starlings, then a single hummingbird heartbeating in the void.  

Inside the creature’s chest, the galaxy writhes. Stars scream as they’re devoured by the machine’s hunger, but you plunge your hands into the chaos and pull out a pulsing starfish-shaped ember—the beast’s core, its *soul*. It burns colder than winter, hotter than first love. You whisper to it. Not words, but memories: your grandmother’s lullaby, the scent of rain on asphalt, the ache of a childhood scar. The ember flickers. The machine shudders.  

The crowd is screaming now, or maybe singing. The glass towers fracture, cascading into butterflies. The beast collapses into a thousand clockwork sparrows, which scatter into the wind, each carrying a shard of its forgotten purpose. You land—not on the bridge, but on a lotus made of smoke—that lifts you toward the liquid sky.  

And then you wake.  

But the taste of ozone lingers. And on your palm, a tiny gear spins, warm and weightless, humming a lullaby in a key no earthly instrument could ever play.
