I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You stand behind a crimson velvet curtain so thick you can feel its fibers against your fingertips, your breathing echoing in your ears. The stage extends out before you like an endless sea—dark, polished, reflecting faint pinpricks of starlight from the elaborate chandelier far overhead. You can just barely make out the silhouettes of hundreds—no, thousands—of onlookers, hushed with breathless anticipation. This is to be your crowning moment, your defining performance, the night that changes everything. 

Then that creeping realization settles in, cold as an arctic wind brushing the back of your neck: every rehearsal, every note you’ve practiced, every position you’ve mastered—none of it is right. You've prepared for the wrong act, memorized the wrong lines, read the wrong music. It’s as though each carefully learned chord, each choreographed step, has slipped into oblivion. Your chest tightens, heart pounding in a dissonant rhythm. 

The spotlight flares on, a single glowing circle that encloses you in pure white. Its edges are impossibly bright, and the rest of the theater melts away into darkness. For one surreal second, you stand completely isolated, eyes wide. You feel the hush of the crowd. 

Just then, the stage transforms under your feet. With a dull, rumbling groan, the polished floorboards ripple like water. A swirl of shimmering smoke gathers around your ankles, rising in whorls that smell faintly of lavender and neon. It climbs and merges with your costume—a sumptuous garment made of midnight-blue sequins that shift in color with each tremble of your pulse. The lights of the chandelier dance across your outfit, creating auroras in the swirling haze. 

Though you’ve forgotten every ounce of your original performance, something wells up from deep inside you, a buried knowledge that brims with possibility. A single, resonant note escapes your lips, echoing in a strange harmony with the swirl of color around you. It vibrates through your body, warming the pit of your stomach, and you realize you must improvise, let the dream guide you. Each breath fuses with a luminous flow of music you never knew you held, each step spontaneously choreographed by the primal beat of your heart. 

Pulses of light cascade through the theater. The audience sways hypnotically, enthralled. With every motion, you conjure swirling wind or glittering sparks. The shapes shift and dance in perfect sync with your voice—or is it an instrument you’re playing? You’re not sure, but the crowd responds as though the two are the same. In the dream, random objects float past—a rose petal drifting across your cheek, a flutter of golden dust glimmering through the air. Emboldened by this drifting magic, you spin faster, your arms alight with shimmering threads connecting you to the stage, to the world, to the stars above. 

In this heady moment, fear dissolves like a distant memory. Even though your preparation was “wrong,” you realize that there’s no such thing as a mistake in the realm of dreams. Here, you are free to define your own stage, your own symphony, bending it to your will. The audience roars in approval—not with the typical applause but with a tangible surge of energy that courses through the theater, weaving into your movements. You are performer, composer, dancer, and conductor, all at once.

You land softly on the final note, your arms extended skyward. The swirling smoke descends back into slumber, the last of the shimmering lights collapsing into the crystal chandelier overhead. For a heartbeat, the stage is silent. Then, like thunder in the distance, an ovation booms across the auditorium, reverberating through your bones. You look out at the crowd, your heart glowing, and realize you have just experienced a performance that transcends understanding. 

Then, without warning, your eyes snap open. The applause lingers like an echo in your ears, but your bedroom is dark and still. A single sliver of moonlight peeks through the curtains, illuminating the reality that you were only dreaming. Yet your pulse still races with the electrifying wonder of that illusory stage, and you can’t help but smile—because even in that brief, fleeting dream, you achieved something astonishing with no preparation at all.
