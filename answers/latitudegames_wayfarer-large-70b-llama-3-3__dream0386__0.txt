I am dreaming. Your dream transports you back to an fantastical carnival with a dark atmosphere. The vibrant colors mutate into your view as you approach a decrepit carousel with a haunting melody that draws you in with bewitching allure. A demented clown materializes and silently gestures for you to take a ride. Once aboard, the carousel gallops at an ever-increasing manic pace, its wooden horses contorting into grotesque forms as the music warps into cacophony. The carnival around you dissolves into kaleidoscopic patterns as your consciousness spirals into a chaotic delirium that refuses to release its hold.
