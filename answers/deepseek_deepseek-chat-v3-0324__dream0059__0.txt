I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and burning candle wax. I blink into the dimness, my heart pounding against my ribs like a trapped bird. The familiar hum of the refrigerator, the faint glow of standby lights—gone. The silence is so deep I can hear my own breath, ragged and uneven.  

Pushing myself up, I stumble to the window and peel back the curtain. The city, once a glittering sprawl of neon and headlights, has been swallowed by an eerie, moonlit hush. Buildings stand like skeletal giants, their darkened windows reflecting nothing but the pale orb above. In the streets below, people move like shadows—some whispering, some shouting, all trying to comprehend the sudden collapse of the world they knew.  

I throw open the window, and the wind carries the distant toll of a church bell, reverberating through the stillness. No sirens, no engines—just the deep, mournful chime echoing as if from centuries past.  

A neighbor, Mr. Hadley, stands in the middle of the road, clutching an antique oil lamp, its trembling flame casting long, dancing shadows. "The wires are dead," he rasps. "The cars won't start. Even the damn watches have stopped."  

I step outside barefoot, the pavement cool and rough beneath my feet. The world feels different. Smells different. Loamy and wild, as if nature is already reclaiming the cracks in the sidewalk. A woman runs past, clutching a bundle of handwritten letters, her breath fogging in the night air. "They say it's not just here," she gasps. "It's everywhere."  

The stars overhead blaze with impossible brilliance, untainted by light pollution, sprawling across the sky like shattered glass. I crane my neck, dizzy beneath their enormity. When was the last time I saw them like this?  

Then—music. Faint, but real. The rich, resonant notes of a violin winding through the alleyways. I follow, pulled by something deep and instinctive. Around the corner, an old man sits on a wooden crate, bow gliding across strings, playing a melody that sounds both ancient and new. Nearby, children gather, their faces flickering in the glow of a bonfire someone has built in an oil drum.  

No phones. No screens. Just firelight, music, and the raw hum of voices weaving together.  

For the first time in years, I feel the weight of my own breath. The fear is still there—what will happen tomorrow? Next week? But beneath it, something else stirs. Something alive.  

And then, as dreams do, the edges blur. The stars spiral. The music melts into the wind.  

And I wake.
