I am dreaming.  

At first, the world around me feels like a vast, velvet-furnished lounge: walls of deep indigo coil inward in gentle spirals, and plush, cloudlike armchairs appear everywhere I look. Each time I sink into one, a wave of soothing warmth washes through my body—pain, worry, and the itch of responsibility dissolve on contact. But as I recline, I notice the air thickens: the more I indulge, the heavier my limbs become, until I’m rooted to the spot, unable to rise. Long after the comfort fades, dust gathers on my thoughts, and a distant ringing of regret trembles through the stillness.  

Round after round, I drift back to those chairs: a single touch promises relief, a revisiting of old safety. Yet with each return, cracks spiderweb across the cushions, sprouting brittle thorns that draw thin lines of blood across my skin. Still, the call of easy rest is nearly irresistible. I find myself teetering on the edge of surrender, craving the immediate hush even as I sense the mounting toll.  

And then, in the deepest hush of that self-defeating spiral, a small whisper rises from beneath the carpeted floorboards: “Break free.” I press my palm to the plush fibers, searching for where the whisper emerges. The carpet splits open, revealing an iron ring set into a wooden hatch. Heart pounding, I tug with all my might—and the hatch swings open to reveal a glowing staircase coiled downward in flickers of molten gold.  

Breaking this self-defeating cycle, I step off the cushion’s edge for the first time. The moment my foot leaves its soft nest, the entire lounge quakes as though frightened. I steady myself and begin to descend. Each step takes me deeper into myself: shadows shrink behind me; the thorns vanish in my wake. The air grows crisp and clear, resonating with a low, triumphant hum.  

At the bottom of the stairwell, I emerge onto a glassy lake under a star-swirled sky. In the distance, a solitary paper boat drifts toward me, glowing with the promise of new choices. I climb inside and find myself at the helm of my own intention—for once, comfort doesn’t come from surrender but from steering with courage. The waters part before me, reflecting a dawn I’ve never truly seen: each color more radiant because I chose to leave the velvet lounge behind.  

I awaken on soft grass at the lake’s edge, the paper boat turned to blossoms around my feet. There is no turning back to that false sanctuary. Instead, I stand tall beneath the awakening light, ready to chart a path that offers both ease and growth—the promise of comfort without the cost of my wings.
