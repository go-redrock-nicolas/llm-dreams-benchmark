I am dreaming. …I pivot from passive witness to lucid explorer.

I find myself in a sky-bound station—a honeycomb of translucent platforms drifting through aurora-striped clouds. Each hexagonal pane is a mirror on the under-side, and as I step, reflections bloom upward like watercolor blossoms. I glimpse versions of me that make split-second judgments: a hurried commuter clutching headlines that confirm what he already believes, a shopper ignoring the unfamiliar stall, a juror weighing evidence on uneven scales. Their faces are mine, yet subtly warped, each distortion a silent confession.

A hush settles, and an obsidian elevator shaft pierces the cloud deck. Its doors open with a sigh of wind, revealing an interior papered in shifting newspaper clippings, social-media feeds, overheard comments—every snippet that ever nudged my thinking. I enter. No buttons; the lift knows the way. We sink through clouds into a vast atrium: the Hall of Hidden Filters.

It resembles a museum built by Escher and Gaudí—staircases twist into Mobius loops, pillars of stained glass depict cognitive biases as saints and gargoyles. Confirmation Bias kneels, clasping identical scrolls to her chest; Halo Effect hovers, radiant rings blinding the eyes; Anchoring Bias drags an iron numeral “1” the size of a grand piano, rust flakes whispering down like snow.

An alabaster docent—half librarian, half compass—greets me. Her voice is a chord on a vibraphone. “Every mirror you faced upstairs was tinted,” she says, handing me a crystalline brush. “Polish one, its color fades. Polish them all, and you will see the world’s true palette.”

I begin with the Mirror of First Impressions. A single stroke of the brush, and the tint dissolves, revealing a stranger’s face neither threatening nor benign, simply curious. A warmth settles in my sternum. I move on, sweeping zealotry from the panes of Political Tribalism, smudging the fingerprints left by Social Proof. Each cleared mirror casts prismatic light onto the gargoyles, shrinking them, taming them.

The hall ripples; exhibits rearrange. I stand before a locked wooden door stenciled: Implicit Associations. My key is introspection, but it feels insufficient. I breathe and the dream bends: my heartbeat becomes a drum, summoning silhouettes from memory—teachers, neighbors, fictional heroes, villains—all murmuring the stories they implanted in me. I listen without flinching. The door unlatches.

Inside is a quiet garden at midnight. Ivy climbs trellises shaped like question marks. Fireflies flicker, each a hypothesis begging to be tested. A lotus pond lies calm; its surface shows reality unvarnished—context, nuance, complexity. I kneel, palms full of polished mirror shards. One by one I submerge them. They dissolve, releasing ribbon-like currents that mingle with the pond’s dark water, turning it lucid silver.

A breeze carries jasmine and distant city sirens. The docent’s voice returns, softer now: “Bias never fully dies, but you’ve taught it to speak its name—and that is the start of freedom.”

Clouds part above the garden, revealing a chandelier of moons. Light threads through me, stitching old assumptions into new understanding. I feel myself rising—up through the atrium, the elevator, the sky-station—until I hover over an earth washed clean of sepia filters. When I finally wake, the scent of jasmine lingers, and every face I meet carries a glimmer of that silver pond.
