I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The sky above you ripples like liquid silk, shifting from midnight blue to bruised purple. Beneath your feet, the ground pulses with each heartbeat, as if the earth itself is listening. You’ve been carrying a coiled tension in your chest—thousands of unspoken words and stifled roars—but here, in this surreal realm, something trembles on the edge of release.

A distant thunder cracks, and a towering oak—its bark carved in runes of memory—splinters before you. From the fissure pours molten gold light, carrying the scent of scorched paper and hot metal. In that instant, the anger you’ve buried for so long surges upward, a living tide that blazes behind your eyes. It feels both heavy and incandescent, a weight you’ve shouldered and a fire you’ve denied.

Handling this emotional eruption, you press your palms to your temples. The air around you thickens, swirling into storm clouds that echo your inner turmoil. Yet instead of fleeing, you lean into the tempest. Your feet anchor into the earth as vines of emerald and obsidian coil around your ankles, drawing up the anger and transmuting it into raw energy. Your lungs fill with charged air, and when you exhale, a shockwave ripples outward, fracturing the sky into shards of crimson and silver.

In the aftermath, the world shudders—and then, like a phoenix from those fractured stars, you rise. Your chest is unburdened; the coiled tension has transformed into a luminous ribbon of power cinching your waist. Each breath you take flares against the gloom, casting long shadows that dance in celebration. The oak’s shattered trunk has reformed into a bridge of polished quartz, arching toward a valley bathed in dawn’s first light. 

As you step forward, the ribbon of energy unfurls behind you, knitting fractured stones and wilting blossoms back to life. Your anger, once a locked storm, has become the forging flame of renewal. In this dream’s closing moments, you realize: you are no longer its prisoner. You are the storm, the calm after, and the promise of a new horizon all at once—awake even before you open your eyes.
