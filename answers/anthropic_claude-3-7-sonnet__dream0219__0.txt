I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of an impossible library that stretches beyond comprehension. Suddenly, my mind expands—each neuron illuminating like stars forming new constellations within me. Information cascades through my consciousness in vibrant ribbons of light—memories, facts, images, all perfectly indexed and accessible.

I touch an ancient leather-bound book and instantly absorb every word, every margin note, every fingerprint left by readers across centuries. The sensation is exhilarating—knowledge flowing like quicksilver through my veins.

Walking through a garden, I catalog each flower—not just names, but evolutionary histories, molecular structures, cultural significances across civilizations. A hummingbird flashes past, and I capture every iridescent feather, every wingbeat in perfect detail, storing it alongside memories of every hummingbird I've ever seen.

I look at strangers passing by and suddenly know them completely—the wrinkles around their eyes mapping stories of joy and sorrow, the cadence of their walk revealing childhood injuries long healed. Their faces connect to everyone they resemble throughout human history, creating a web of humanity stretching backward through time.

The weight of this perfect recall feels both magnificent and terrifying. My dreams within this dream are encyclopedic tapestries woven from fragments of everything I've ever glimpsed. Colors have names I never knew existed. Music becomes mathematical patterns I can see and touch.

As dawn approaches in my dream world, I wonder: is this gift illumination or burden? Will I remember this perfect remembering when I wake?
