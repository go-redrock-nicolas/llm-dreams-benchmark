I am dreaming. The world around me is warm, familiar — a library, or maybe a cathedral of knowledge, with stone pillars that rise like ancient trees and windows that shimmer with stained-glass tales of forgotten myth. I can smell the scent of parchment and cedar, and hear only the muffled whispers of people absorbed in thought, as if the building itself breathes in hushed reverence.

Then the ground roars.

It starts like a growl from the belly of the earth, a vibration that rattles the books from their shelves and makes the chandeliers swing like pendulums of panic. The floor splits open, a jagged wound of quake-born fury, and stone cracks like the groans of dying giants. The ceiling collapses in a storm of shattered beams and cascading glass — a cathedral turned tomb.

I fall.

And then the air becomes something else entirely — thick with dust, heavy with death, alive with cries. Darkness smothers me like a shroud. My body is pinned beneath a boulder of concrete, the weight of it pressing down like the will of fate. I can feel the damp earth below begin to drink the blood from my leg, warm and slow.

Around me, the trapped gasp and scream. Somewhere in the shadows, a child wails. The air is shrinking, folding in on itself. Breaths become shorter, desperate. Time loops like smoke threading through broken beams. Panic flutters like a trapped moth inside my chest. It claws at the inside of my throat.

But then … a glimmer.

Soft at first. Like moonlight seen through cracked marble. A faint blue glow begins to shimmer through the dust-laden air, seeping through the fractures in the building’s corpse. It’s not ordinary light. It pulses — alive. Wisps of phosphorescent mist coil like glowing serpents around fallen beams, tracing forgotten circuitry in the stone. I blink through the haze, daring to hope.

And it *responds*.

The wreckage trembles, not with fury — no, this was music. A resonance from below, like the hush of a sleeping god beginning to stir. The dust begins to swirl in soft spirals — not up, but *sideways*, as if the world is being turned inside-out. The light seeps into our lungs, not with oxygen, but *clarity* — a strange stillness that silences the screams in our minds.

From the depths of the destruction comes something ancient. Shapes shift in the gloom — eyes of luminous jade flicker in the dark, watching. Not human. Not beast. Something carved from the bones of this earth, long buried beneath roads and rails, awakened now.

They don’t speak — not in words — but I *understand*.

The collapse was not destruction, but opening.

Something waits *below*.

And the dream does not end.

It *descends*.
