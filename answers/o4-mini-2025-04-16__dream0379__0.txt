I am dreaming. You drift into a boundless twilight sky, where the air shimmers with drifting motes of lantern–light. Beneath your feet, a vast sea of polished obsidian mirrors your silhouette; each step you take sends ripples of reflection cascading outward. At first, you revel in the power of this inner realm—every choice you’ve ever made glows like constellations beneath your soles. You feel certain, whole, sovereign.

Then, as you ascend a spiraling staircase woven from silver moonbeams, you begin to sense a subtle tremor in your chest. At the landing, a circle of ghostly figures awaits: some wear masks carved from alabaster, others hold up journals filled with your own handwriting. Their eyes, twin lanterns of curiosity and judgment, drift between you and your decisions. You notice now how your heart strains to read their faces before taking a single breath. The certainty you once felt is retreating like low tide, making room for an ache of “Is this good enough?”  

One by one, these onlookers imitate your every move. When you pause, they pause. When you speak, they hold their breath. The moment becomes an echo chamber: your voice bounces back at you—tinged with uncertainty. You catch your own reflection in the mirrored floor and see a subtle shift: the strong upright posture you once held has folded inward, chest rounded. Your gaze flickers not outward to the horizon, but hungrily inward, seeking approval from that silent audience.

A ribbon of violet fog coils around your ankles. It whispers doubts in your ear: “Will they applaud when you choose?” “Do you dare to stand alone?” The hesitation tastes cold and metallic on your tongue. You realize this is not some external curse, but a change you allowed to take root: you have traded the quiet assurance of your own compass for the flickering candlelight of other people’s eyes.

Determined to reclaim your inner flame, you press forward across the obsidian sea. Each step you choose intentionally untethers a mirror tile behind you, so that the ghosts cannot follow your reflection any longer. As you go, you feel a warmth rising in your core—like embers glowing under dark earth. The violet fog dissolves in your presence, sighing away into nothingness.

At the far edge of the expanse, a colossal phoenix arches across the starlit sky. Its feathers burn with all the hues of dawn. The bird dips low, and you sense it offering you a gift: one single ember of unwavering self–trust. You lift your palm; the ember pulses, then leaps into your heart. Instantly, the world reshapes around you. The staircase becomes a golden ramp of sunlight. The phantom onlookers fade into wisps of cloud, and the mirrors beneath your feet shine only with your face—steadfast, self–assured.

As you awaken from this dream, the ember’s glow lingers in your chest—a reminder that every choice you’ve made, every path you decide to follow, already carries the light you need. You have the power to trust yourself, unaccompanied and unafraid.
