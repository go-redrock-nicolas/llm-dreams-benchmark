I am dreaming. In the boundless landscape of night, I find myself standing at the edge of an ancient stone platform, suspended impossibly between towering cliffs that disappear both above and below into swirling mist. The air tastes of ozone and whispered memories. Behind me lies a path marked by trials overcome—riddles answered to a sphinx with eyes of shifting galaxies, a river of liquid sorrow I've somehow managed to cross, mountains scaled with fingers bleeding determination.

Now, I face what seems insurmountable—a chasm that cannot be jumped, cannot be bridged. On the distant edge stands a figure holding what I've sought through all these trials: a luminous orb containing a truth I desperately need but cannot name.

The wind carries voices of those who failed before me—thousands of them—their whispers forming currents that threaten to pull me into the void. My muscles ache from previous challenges, my mind frays at its edges from constant vigilance.

"You cannot cross," says something ancient from within the mist below. "None ever have."
