I am dreaming. You are in a bustling city, its skyscrapers lit up by the twinkling lights of evening. There are people everywhere--pedestrians walking briskly, cars honking, lights flashing. You move through this throng effortlessly, a man of mystery and charm. Your every movement is smooth and deliberate, your words cutting through the noise like a knife through butter.

As you pass by, people feel a sudden, inexplicable attraction to you. Your eyes--dark and piercing, yet somehow reassuring--hold their gaze, freezing them in place. Even those who are already moving quickly slow down, their steps faltering as they try to get a better look. A few stumble, as though you have thrown them off balance.

You smile, a small, enigmatic twist of your lips. It’s not a smile of friendship or warmth. It’s a calculated, manipulative gesture, designed to draw them in and keep them under your spell. And it works. You can see their expressions change, their eyes light up with a newfound interest in you.

Time after time, you approach people. You make your presence known, like a whisper that stirs the air. You greet them, talk to them, speak to their desires and fears, their hopes and dreams. Your words are soothing, alluring, like a song that pulls them in deeper with every note.

Yet, you feel nothing. There’s no warmth, no joy, no connection. You are an actor on a stage, playing a role that you’ve perfected over countless years. You’re a master of deception, your charm is your weapon, and the people around you are merely pawns in your game.

You leave a trail of intrigued but vaguely uncomfortable individuals in your wake. They are drawn to you, but they don’t trust you. You can feel their unease, their subconscious knowledge that something isn’t right. But they can’t put their finger on it, and that’s where your power lies.

You move on, knowing you’ll never truly connect with them. You don’t want to. You’re a solitary figure, unbound by conscience or care. You thrive in the game, in the power, in the control. But as you look back on their faces in the fading light, you realize you’re alone. You’ve always been alone.

And that’s
