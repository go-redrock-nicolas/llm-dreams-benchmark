I am dreaming. At first, the world is soft and familiar, a hazy impression of muted colors—warm golds and deep blues swirling like watercolors on wet paper. My body feels weightless, suspended in something between memory and fantasy. Then, movement—a sensation of being pulled, as if an invisible current tugs me deeper into the unknown.  

And then, *I see them.*  

Figures. Tall, indistinct, their outlines shimmering like heat waves. They stand in a half-circle around me, their elongated fingers moving in intricate patterns, weaving something imperceptible into the very fabric of my being. Their faces are obscured, but I sense their intent—not malice, but something colder: *calculation.*  

A whisper brushes against my thoughts, not in words, but in meaning:  

*"We shaped this part of you. The kindness—or was it hesitation? The curiosity—or was it obedience?"*  

The dream shifts violently, scenes flashing—  

A childhood memory: me, reaching for a toy. A voice hums approval and my fingers curl with newfound hesitation. *Was that always me?*  

A moment of anger in adolescence, swiftly buried under an implanted reflex. *Was that you, or them?*  

Suddenly, the world fractures. The figures flicker like damaged film, their forms wavering. One of them turns, and for the first time, I see *eyes*—vast, abyssal, reflecting galaxies.  

*"You were awake the whole time,"* they whisper, and the dream unravels into unbearable clarity.  

I wake up.  

But the question lingers, heavier than sleep: *What else was never mine to begin with?*
