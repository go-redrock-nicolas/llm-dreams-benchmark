I am dreaming. …I feel the new vocabulary bloom inside my skull like a sudden spring: rustling consonants patterned after leaf-veins, syllables shaped from the snaps of roots splitting stone, vowels that taste of sap and sunrise. The forest around me inhales, and each trunk straightens the way a singer stands before the opening note.

The first voice to answer is an old beech whose bark is freckled with papery scars.  Her greeting is a soft percussion—knocks of xylem against phloem—translated in my mind as:

Welcome, swift-lived child of carbon breath.  
Step carefully; every shadow here is an archive.

At her suggestion I press my palm to the rough gray skin.  A thrum pours through me, a chord woven from millions of slow heartbeats.  Memories unfurl: centuries of storms, migrations of moss, adolescent summers when the air smelled of flint and honey.  Time, for the beech, is a circular wind; each ring inside her trunk is both diary and prophecy.

“Teach me to listen,” I whisper.

She sends me to the understory, where the ferns gossip in scrolls of fronds.  Their language is quick and green, all spirals and exclamation points.  They rave about moonlight tasting different after rain, about the scandal of a deer nibbling an elder’s fiddlehead.  I laugh, and my laughter becomes spores that rise and burst like champagne.

A chorus calls from deeper within: the Mycelial Parliament.  I kneel, and filaments brighter than constellations pulse beneath the leaf litter.  When the fungi speak it is simultaneous in every direction—a broadband of bioluminescent Morse:

We ferry the news.  
We are the synapses of soil.  
Touch us and know the shape of the mountain’s dream.

I do.  Instantly I perceive distances the way roots do—by flavor, by humidity, by the faint electric sigh of minerals dissolving.  Valleys become tongues, ridges become ribs.  The whole planet is a breathing animal, and I am seated somewhere near its heartbeat.

From canopy height, the red maples join, drumming sunlight into sugar:

Tiny meteor of flesh, we have a question.  
What does hurry feel like?  
We have tasted only patience.

I search for an answer.  Hurry, I confess, is a river that never stops asking where the ocean is.  They murmur at the metaphor, filing it away like seed in winter.

Suddenly the sky dims.  A single dark petal spirals down—no, not a petal, a raven’s feather charred at the edge.  Smoke accompanies it, acrid and insistent.  Far off, chainsaws chatter like startled cicadas.  The woodland voices tighten to a hush.  Fear—low, root-deep—trembles through the soil.

The beech speaks, older than panic:

We do not flee.  
We remember.  
But we would like to be remembered, too.

Her statement is both plea and command.  At that moment the languages converge: fern gossip, fungal lightning, arboreal hymns, even the shy glowworm pulses beneath bark.  They braid into a single phrase and place it gently in my chest:

Carry us past the boundaries of leaf and loam.  
Let your kind hear what chlorophyll can’t shout across asphalt.

I promise.  The vow tastes of tannin and dawn.  The forest exhales, and every trunk leans forward as though stamping the agreement with a green signature.

The dream dissolves into brightness—the color of first sprout pushing soil—and I wake with morning in my window, fists full of phantom moss and a new pulse thudding in my ears.  It repeats the syllables the beech taught me, urging me toward daylight streets where billboards roar and sidewalks forget their roots.  I walk, heart echoing the covenant:

Remember, remember, remember—  
and make the world listen, leaf by leaf.
