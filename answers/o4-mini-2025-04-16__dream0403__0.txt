I am dreaming. You are dreaming. The world around you shimmers with liquid opals and drifting motes of golden dust. At first all is calm: a wide lavender sky drapes itself above you, and the air hums with a gentle pulse, as though the very atmosphere breathes. But then you become aware of that small, nagging flicker in your mind—a perceived slight from someone whose approval you’ve long treasured.  

As soon as the thought arrives, the dreamscape shifts. The lavender sky fractures into shards of obsidian glass that rain down in slow motion. Each shard bears a fragment of a memory: a sidelong glance you thought dismissive, a half-heard word you felt sting you. They clink around your feet, growing in number until you feel their edges pressing into your skin, demanding attention. Your heartbeat quickens, and the air tastes metallic with worry.  

Aware of how this rumination coils around your chest, you take a deep breath. The obsidian fragments pause mid-fall, hanging like dark promises. Then, with an act of will, you draw them into your palms. They melt into formless smoke that curls around you, cold and serpentine. For a moment, fear tightens your throat—yet beneath it glows a curious warmth: the spark of your own intention. You realize that every pain-laden thought is nothing more than this smoke, shaped by your own mind.  

Gathering courage, you step forward through a curtain of drifting fog. On the other side lies a vast lake of mercury—mirror-smooth and endlessly deep. With each breath you release into the fog, the surface of the lake ripples outward. You lean over and drop the coil of smoky thought into the water. Ripples wash it away, turning the mercury from pewter gray to molten gold in a blossoming shimmer. The lake carries those tendrils far from you, transforming them into light.  

You close your eyes and feel your chest expand. Where once the shards of hurt pricked you, now a soft horizon of gentle blue unfolds. The lake’s golden glow seeps upward, warming your veins. In the distance, a single white bird takes flight, trailing silver stardust. You understand: the slight never had power of its own. It became heavy only because you carried it.  

As the bird vanishes into that boundless sky, the mist around you lifts. Your breath slows, your heartbeat settles. In this dream—vivid and strange—you’ve turned worry into wonder, captivity into freedom. And just before you wake, you smile, knowing that in both dream and waking life, you hold the alchemy to transmute pain into light.
