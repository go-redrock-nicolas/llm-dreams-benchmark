I am dreaming.

I am walking through a peaceful forest, dappled sunlight flickering through an emerald canopy overhead, the scent of moss and wildflowers alive in the air. My footsteps are nearly silent on the soft bed of fallen leaves, and somewhere nearby, a brook burbles contentedly.

But suddenly, the world hushes. The birds seem to know before I do—a raw tension laces the air. The forest darkens as swollen storm clouds churn and tumble overhead, swallowing the sun in a bruised swirl of violet and silver. The temperature drops, and a prickling breeze whispers through the trees, carrying with it the ozone tang of impending rain.

Thunder rumbles in the distance—a deep, ancient growl echoing between the trunks. As I gaze upward, electric blue veins of lightning carve wild rivers through the sky, illuminating the forest in jagged flashes. The trees groan and sway, their branches clawing at the roiling heavens.

Raindrops, fat and cold, begin to fall. They gather on my skin and in my hair, chilling me. The world becomes a shimmering curtain of rain, everything blurred and glistening. I keep walking, deeper into the storm’s heart, feeling exhilarated—almost as though the storm is alive and calling me onward.

Ahead, light flickers amber and gold between the trees. I follow, heart pounding, and discover a clearing aglow with hundreds of floating lanterns—delicate globes humming gently with warm light. The storm swirls around the clearing, but not a single drop breaches its perimeter; I step into the calm oasis, feeling the weight of the storm lift.

The air is thick with the scent of wet earth and flickers of forgotten memories. I realize the lanterns seem to pulse in tune with my heartbeat, and as I reach out, one drifts closer. Inside, instead of a flame, dances a tiny, luminescent bird, wings shimmering with colors seen only in dreams.

The storm rages at the edges, safe and distant now, and I am filled with peaceful wonder at the heart of its wild beauty—an island of tranquility cradled by chaos, a dream within a dream.
