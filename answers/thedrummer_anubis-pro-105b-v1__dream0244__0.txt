I am dreaming. I find myself in a small town called Ethos, where members have navigated exactly the same complex ethical dilemma that I am currently facing. As I walk around the town, I notice the diverse perspectives and solutions that the residents have shared.

One elderly man is tending to his garden and thinks that sharing knowledge is a fundamental good that should be prioritized over privacy. "It's like my garden. I planted those bamboos, they are my property, but they also produce oxygen which can be enjoyed by everyone in this village. I do this to reciprocate nature's generosity." He planted the bamboos and saw beauty in the way his neighbors also get to enjoy their sweet smell and the sight of their gentle sway in the breeze.

Next, a young woman who runs a local bakery reluctantly agrees. She says that her family recipe was passed from her mother, but she does not feel deep enough to assert ownership of the sweet pastries. "It's nice to know where recipes begin," she says, "and it all tastes so good! It satisfies a basic instinct, like sharing views of the sky, a smell of the sea, or a note from a musical instrument."

In Ethos, there seem to be a broad variety of principles shared by its residents. But at the same time, the realization that every astute ethical solution can be nailed on greater or lesser ends is standard. The leading expert, a great scientist, is also ready to explain. "We embrace objects of knowledge, on one hand, and locate the degree to which they are extorted," he says. "Though nothing if night makes investigations that stretch common-basal acceptance jumping on a position in the universe... privacy"

Traveling in dream, Ethos shared my dreaming zeal: or I took all from it, and then saw me as knowledge, extended and refraing. To draw threads from both lays the threefolded term: Ethos nettsteder
