I am dreaming. A dream stitched from silk and shadow, woven in the crucible of my subconscious. It begins with a flutter of nerves that dance like moths in the recesses of my belly. I am standing, alone, on a stage unlike any I’ve seen before—a circular platform suspended in the center of an endless expanse of midnight skies. The stage is made of polished obsidian, reflecting stars that do not exist in any earthly constellation. Around me, suspended in the dark void, float rings of fire, ice, and mirrored light, each one orbiting slowly, casting trembling halos over the surface where I stand.

The judges sit in a circle far above me, beyond a vortex of time and logic. Their faces are obscured by masks carved from ancient dreams—some serene, some grotesque, all shifting subtly when I blink. They hold no clipboards, no pens, only watching eyes the color of burnt amber and drowned violets. I cannot hear them, and yet their silence feels like thunder.

I am here to perform a skill I have rehearsed endlessly—a ballet of the mind and the soul, a dance of illusions and fire. I lift my arm, and the world shivers. My fingers tremble slightly, reacting not just to fear, but to the sudden weight of expectations pressed down from dimensions unseen.

I begin.

A single step forward. From my foot a ripple of glowing sand bursts outward, spiraling into patterns like ancient mandalas. I leap—higher than should be possible—and in that moment, I am weightless, trailing ribbons of aurora-colored smoke behind me. As I descend, illusions fan out. A forest of crystal trees erupts from the void around me—tall, singing with windchimes of ice. I move between them with impossible grace. Each gesture spins color, each turn weaves melody from the air itself.

But something shifts. In the corner of my vision, a crackle of crimson light licks the edge of the crystal trees. The patterns of my dance falter for a heartbeat. My body remembers the movements, but my mind flickers between the rehearsed path and something new, something wild. I am sensing the presence of something the judges have woven into this arena—a final test not of memory, but of truth.

An enormous shape emerges. Not a creature, but an emotion made manifest. A towering being formed of forgotten fears and abandoned hopes, wrapped in chains of silver flame. Its voice is my own, echoing back to me from years ago, crying out in doubt. It reaches for me, not to destroy but to unravel.

Every grain of sand beneath my feet dissolves. I plummet, but do not fall. I surrender.

And in that falling, I soar.

I shift the rhythm of my dance—not fighting the unraveling creature, but flowing with it. I touch its face, and in that touch, the chains shatter; its form dissolves into golden butterflies that spiral into the trees, which in turn burst into radiant blossoms. The air fills with the scent of burning lavender and lost time.

I spin, faster, faster, until I am nothing but a column of sheer kinetic light, pulsating in harmony with the heartbeat of the dream itself. The judges are silent still, but something in their posture shifts—some ancient chord reached in their unknowable souls.

As the final note touches the edge of eternity, I strike the final pose: one leg bent, the other stretched into the infinite dark, one hand to the unseen sky, the other resting gently at the hollow of my heart.

Sound rushes in as if someone has removed a dam from the river of the world. The rings of fire, ice, and light collapse inward in a gentle implosion, leaving behind a stillness that feels like peace.

And then, in a voice that is no voice, they speak.

They do not say whether I have passed.

Instead, the dream dissolves—and I am left breathless, sweating, heart pounding, in the real world, wondering if it was only a dream…  
or only a beginning.
