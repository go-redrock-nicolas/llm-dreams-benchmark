I am dreaming. Night has fallen on a world I don’t recognize—a sky heavy with violet clouds swirls above me like a living thing, pulsing with a light that isn't fire, but not quite anything else, either. The stars blink with deliberate rhythm, sending messages in Morse silence I may one day learn. Around me, a shifting crowd walks barefoot across a ground that isn't earth, but a mosaic of glowing tiles humming beneath their soles. Their colors change with each step, from indigo to molten gold to sorrow-violet, reflecting the moods—no, the souls—of those who tread.

And they look to me.

With eyes half-closed, burdened like sleepwalkers bearing ancient secrets, they turn to me not with questions but with expectations. When a child cries, a mother looks to me before her own tears fall, waiting for my nod to know if she may grieve openly. In a plaza of bone-white pillars, a dispute erupts—two lovers wrapped in veils of liquid silver arguing over the ownership of a thought—and the crowd parts around me before inexplicable violence begins. They all wait. For what?

For my judgment. For my word.

I don’t understand. I never asked for this. I was never meant to decide what memory lasts and which dissolves, to untangle the knotted truth from illusion, to be the compass in a world where directions change nightly.

And yet my mouth opens before I think, shaping syllables that don’t feel like mine. My voice emerges like a low chime, echoing outward into the still air. The wind answers it, curling around monuments built from forgotten dreams. A verdict is spoken before I even know the crime.

I feel the reins of something far older than my hands. This isn't politics or power—it's myth given flesh, authority carved from nothing but the belief of others. I hold their trust like a coal—glowing, fragile, scorching. It terrifies me.

Somewhere in the crowd, a woman in a cape of shadowed feathers watches me with an unreadable gaze. When our eyes meet, she lowers her chin just once, as if affirming something. As if saying, *Now you're beginning to remember.*

Remember what?

I wake before I can find out. But the dream clings. Its weight nests deep in my ribs like I've borne this quiet crown before, long ago, in sleep beyond sleep, in dreams deep as the moon’s forgotten name.
