I am dreaming. I’m on a subway that’s packed with people. The air is warm, a little musty. I see faces around me—some tired, some zoned out on their phones, a few babies asleep against their parents. The train jolts a little, but that's normal. Then, without warning, the lights flicker and die. Darkness. Total. Not the kind you find in a cave—this is deeper, older. The Hissss of static cuts through the silence, like a live wire. Someone shouts. Then another. A child starts crying. The air grows colder. Not cold, colder. Like the temperature dropped twenty degrees in two seconds. I can see my breath. Wait, can’t see my breath—there’s no light. But I FEEL the cold. It’s biting.

A man’s voice, calm, says, “We need to stay together.” It’s booming, resonant, not his own. His words echo in a way that distorts their shape. He repeats, “Stay together,” but the second time it’s echoed two, three times, panning around the train. That’s impossible. The lights hum back on—but they’re not the same. They’re pale blue, glowing like a monitor’s standby light. The windows are gone. Replaced with some sort of obsidian, reflecting nothing back. The walls shimmer faintly, as if wet, but not wet, more like they’re breathing.

A woman steps forward. She’s translucent, her outline flickering. Not a human—too tall, too thin, her hair a cascade of liquid mercury. Her eyes are dollar-store Christmas lights—multicolored, blinking out and igniting randomly. “This is a test,” she says, her voice like a dial-up modem connecting. “The space between stations is not empty.” A child giggles. The sound is all wrong, high and tinny. The air smells like ozone and burnt sugar.

She raises a hand, and the train begins to float—slowly at first, then picking up speed. We’re weightless now, but the people stay glued to the seats and floor. The tracks outside? There’s no track. Just void. Pitch, endless. But there’s something there—a figure, hazy, massive. A shadow with too many limbs, joints where there shouldn’t be. It’s watching.

The humming in the lights stops. Silence. Then—music. A piano melody, haunting, played backwards perhaps? It wraps around the ears like cobwebs. The woman laughs. “You pass.” The ground lurches. We’re back. The car’s normal again. The doors open. She’s gone. The child’s crying stops abruptly. Everyone stares ahead, unseeing. I step out, onto the platform, and my shoes leave marks that glow faintly.
