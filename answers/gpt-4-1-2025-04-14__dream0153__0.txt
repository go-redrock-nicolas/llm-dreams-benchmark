I am dreaming.

It’s dusk in a battered city where the day washes itself in hues of copper and burnt sienna. I stand at the epicenter of a sprawling encampment—tents patchworked together, shadowed by the skeletons of half-collapsed buildings. The air throbs with urgent voices and the low hum of distant generators, the mingling scents of wood smoke, exhaustion, and hope brushing past me like ghosts in the gathering twilight.

Before me stretches a tide of people—families clutching weathered sacks, children wrapped in threadbare blankets, elderly faces lined with the cartography of survival. The compound is a pulsing heart in the city’s ruins, thrumming with need. My own heart pounds with the heavy knowledge that we have—just—enough food for two out of every five, and not even half the required medicine. Our trucks, once promising, now stand half-empty. Helicopters remain grounded under tempestuous clouds gathering resolve overhead.

A wall of maps and lists rises before me—needs prioritized by urgency and geography, names penned hastily next to maladies and numbers. My team crowds close—exhausted but determined eyes awaiting guidance. The crisis is hydra-headed: a sudden outbreak of fever in the south tents, a flash flood warning for the riverbound perimeter, rumors of encroaching violence from the city outskirts. The radio crackles with pleas—from a doctor whose supplies dwindle, from a mother whose son’s fever climbs, from community leaders begging for clean water. Each voice presses upon me, weighty as stone.

I breathe in deep, conjuring calm from the marrow of my dream-self. Hands shaking just slightly, I point: the medical team must go to the outbreak, take half our remaining antibiotics. The food convoy reroutes to the northern cluster where the malnourished wait, leaving ration cards behind for those to come tomorrow—if supplies arrive. I delegate a strike team to reinforce flood defenses, old tarps and sandbags scavenged from corners long thought empty. I watch my team disperse like bright threads weaving through the tapestry of chaos, each one carrying a fraction of my worry, my hope.

Then, in that liminal space only dreams can conjure, the dead radios begin to glow softly. Voices rise—not just in despair but in song, a lullaby from the south tents. A child’s laughter tumbles out as clean water splashes into a battered pan. Something ancient echoes in me—an understanding that while resources falter, resolve multiplies if sown with compassion. I realize I am not balancing numbers, but nurturing a flame: the will to continue, even when all logic says it cannot be done.

Above, the sky splits with rain, silver and cool. I tilt my face upward, letting the drops mingle with the sweat and salt of too many days. In this waking dream, under a storm-splintered sky, I feel the weight of every choice, know its cost, yet hold tight to the slender, resilient thread of hope. Here, in the heart of crisis, I am more alive than awake.
