I am dreaming. I find myself in a city where buildings breathe and street lamps bend like curious onlookers. The sky overhead shifts between watercolor hues—indigo bleeding into amber before dissolving into a mist of pearl. I'm walking along a spiraling path that seems to remember my footsteps, each one leaving a momentary glow before fading.

Ahead, I see figures seated at a grand circular table perched impossibly on a floating island of mosaic tiles. As I approach, I recognize them as the guardians of validation—their faces both familiar and strange, like memories half-remembered. One has my father's posture but a clock for a face, another resembles a childhood teacher with hands made of turning pages.

I present them with offerings: achievements folded into paper birds, dreams spun into gossamer threads, vulnerabilities carved into small wooden boxes. Each time I place an item before them, they examine it without expression, then place it into a crystalline vessel that never seems to fill.

"Please," I hear myself say, though my voice emerges as music rather than words. "Is it enough?"

They exchange glances and lean away, their shadows stretching toward the horizon, growing longer with each moment of silence.

The realization washes over me like cold water—this endless pursuit has become my prison. The ground beneath me shifts, and I notice wildflowers breaking through cracks in the tiles, forming a pattern that points away from the table.

Something warm blooms in my chest as I turn from them. The path ahead transforms, revealing a doorway framed by vines bearing fruit I've never seen before. Beyond it lies an uncharted garden where mirrors hang from branches, each reflecting not my appearance but my essence.

In this moment, I understand—I have been the keeper of the approval I seek all along.
