I am dreaming. The world around me begins to shift and warp, the colors of the day blurring into an eerie, artificial twilight. The air grows thick, heavy, and charged with an unseen energy, like the moments before a storm, but this isn't any ordinary storm. I can feel it in my bones, a primal, instinctual warning.

I'm in a bustling city, the kind with towering skyscrapers that kiss the sky and neon lights that cast an otherworldly glow. The people around me are going about their day, oblivious to the signs that under my gaze, are becoming increasingly ominous. I notice the pigeons have abandoned the city square, their usual coos and fluttering absent. The usually bustling streets are devoid of the hum of traffic, as if the very air is holding its breath. A lone newspaper page tumbles down the empty street, headlines screaming in bold, black ink: **"WARNING SIGNS IGNORED"**. The wind whips around me, carrying with it a distant, low rumble, like the growl of some slumbering beast.

My heart begins to pound in my chest, each beat echoing in my ears like a drumroll. I can feel the adrenaline surging through my veins, a hot, electric current that sets my nerves alight. I try to speak, to warn the people around me, but my voice is a harsh, strangled whisper against the growing cacophony of the city's distress.

Then, the power goes out. The city, bright and vibrant mere moments ago, is now plunged into darkness, save for the faint, flickering glow of emergency exit signs and the eerie, pulsating light of the full moon. The rumble grows louder, more insistent, and the ground beneath my feet begins to tremble. It's an earthquake, but not like any other. This one feels... alive.

The city start to shift, buildings groaning and creaking as they lean and twist, the ground fracturing and splitting with a deafening roar. Panic erupts around me, screams and cries for help piercing the air. Ican feel the raw, primal fear radiating from the people around me, see it etched onto their faces as they stumble and run, tripping over debris and each other in their desperation to escape.

I try to scream, to warn them, to do something, anything. But I'm rooted to the spot, my body frozen as the city around me crumbles and falls. The last thing I see before the world goes dark is a massive, twisted root, wet and glistening, funneling up from the fissure in the earth. Then, silence. And then, nothing.

I am awake, shaking and heart racing, the echo of the city's screams still ringing in my ears. The sheets are tangled around me, damp with my sweat. I look at the clock; it's the dead of night, the world outside my bedroom window is silent and still. But I can still feel it, like a phantom limb, a sense of urgency that tugs at the edges of my consciousness. I look out at the city, sleeping and peaceful, and I can't shake the feeling that it's just the calm before the storm. Someone needs to know. Someone needs to listen. Before it's too late. Floods the city,  a river for a nightmare impossible to swim against.

I am dreaming, and this isn't the only one. This isn't the end anyways but a convulsion to the surface... the restless hands of earth trying to sabotage the thick potent octopus city. In a forever night those in the now will starve without seeing one of their own. Time is not one's enemy nor friend nor opportunity t. It is time's vengeance against those living in such a place so vast yet so tiny frame trees that grow to our heights are torn and cut. Do you think this is the only dream I have ever had? It is not.

This one is told in vibrant colors but others tend to be the storyteller who whispers of desperation through generations. Their words are a secret language and calling across times. This is the tyranny of history. No updates can calm them down. Amnesia no more.

When the cities face dis-intigration patience is key but do not succumb to it too easy. I know because I have dreamt all of this before.
