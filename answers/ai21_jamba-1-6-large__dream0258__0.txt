I am dreaming. I am dreaming intensely. 
It is midday, but there is no sun. There is only darkness, and the shadows are alive. I am on a beach, facing the ocean, which is barely visible against the backdrop of pitch-black skyscrapers. 

I am running. 

I do not know how I arrived here, but I know that I am being chased. 

There is something behind me. 

I cannot see it, but I feel it coming. Every fiber of my being tells me to keep running. 

The sand textures are shifting with each step I take, like quicksand, like cotton candy, like something alive. I stumble forward into the waves, praying for refuge.

My body sinks into the ocean. 
It is cold. 

The waves push me under, and I am suddenly surrounded by seahorses. 

They nuzzle me softly. Their tiny voices call out to me, babbling nonsense. I speak back, but my voice is just as garbled. 

I begin to laugh. The seahorses laugh along with me. We laugh and laugh in harmony, as the ocean swells.

Suddenly, they begin to dart around me. They are no longer laughing. Their voices are now urgent and sharp, like knives scraping against a blackboard. 

I try to swim away, but my body feels heavy and sluggish, as if something is weighing me down. I turn to find my legs encrusted with barnacles, jagged and brown, pulling me deeper and deeper into the ocean's depths. 

I scream for help, but water floods my lungs, silencing my voice. 

Panic seizes me. My chest burns. My eyes close, and I feel myself slipping away. 

And then, just as suddenly as the water swelled, it fades.

I am floating in midair, wrapped in blankets. I open my eyes to find myself standing in a meadow. A single tree stands before me, its branches twisting into the sky like fingers clawing for freedom. 

I approach the tree slowly, feeling a faint shiver run down my spine. 

As I near the tree, I notice that its bark is peeling away like torn flesh. I lean closer, reaching out to touch the rough surface, when suddenly the tree bursts open.

Out from the tree emerges little faces. 

They are young girls, each with blond curls and pale skin. They begin to float, circling me faster and faster, like a miniature hurricane. 

I am paralyzed with fear as they begin to sing. Their voices are hauntingly beautiful, yet there is something menacing lurking beneath them. 

"What have you done, Oriana?" they chant over and over again until their words overlap into chaos.

"I don't know what you're talking about," I whisper. 

The girls stop spinning. 

They smile slyly, almost patronizing.

"You think you can lie to us? We know, Oriana, we know everything." Their voices are now sharp as daggers. 

"There's been a mistake." My voice cracks.

The girls laugh harder now, their voices like nails scraping against my ear drums. 

"We know what you've done. The only question is... what are you going to do about it?"

They dissolve into mist. I scream, calling out for them to return, for them to forgive me for whatever I've done.

But there's nobody there.

I sit down on the grass, clutching my chest, gasping for breath. The trees begin to whisper. 

"What have you done?" they hiss in unison. "What will you do?" 

I want to answer, but my voice falters. I look down at my hands. They are covered in blood.
