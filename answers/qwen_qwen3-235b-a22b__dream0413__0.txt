I am dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning lavender, and the sky pulses like a living thing—indigo waves rippling over a canvas of molten gold. Beneath my feet, the ground is not earth but a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting not my face, but fragments of lives I’ve never lived: a queen mid-scream, a star collapsing, a child releasing a paper lantern into a monsoon. I speak, and my voice is not my own. It drips with the honeyed cadence of a poet I once idolized, his words curling off my tongue like smoke rings that harden into glass sculptures midair. I gesture, and my hands move with the precise, theatrical flair of a stage actor whose performances haunted me for years, each motion a brushstroke of melodrama.  

I notice.  

A figure stands at the edge of the mirrored landscape—a silhouette stitched from moonlight. It mirrors me exactly, but its eyes are pools of quicksilver, reflecting back not my image, but my *essence*: a flickering film of memories, desires, and borrowed mannerisms. I’ve become a collage of others, a puppet strung with threads pulled by ghosts. The realization thrums like a drumline in my ribs.  

Suddenly, the dream shifts. I’m in a library with no walls, books floating like schools of bioluminescent fish. I reach for one, and it dissolves into a flock of origami cranes that screech in the voice of my childhood mentor, their wings shedding pages that read: *“You are a thief of selves. You wear us like costumes.”* I stumble backward, but my legs belong to a stag now, antlers sprouting ivy that blooms with tiny, weeping faces. The floor becomes a river of liquid amber, and in it, I see her—Ophelia, or a version of her, her hair a tangle of riverweed, her lips moving in a silent dirge. I mimic her sorrow, my own throat filling with the weight of unshed ballads, my fingers twitching to pluck a lily from the water and cradle it like a dying bird.  

But then—a laugh. Sharp, irreverent, slicing through the gloom. A figure materializes, all swagger and shadow: a pirate queen, a trickster god, a woman I once scribbled about in teenage journals. She tosses a dagger in the air, catches it, and grins. “Stop *curating* yourself,” she snarls, her voice a blend of my own teenage defiance and the rasp of a jazz singer I adore. “You’re a museum of everyone but *you*.” The dagger flies toward me, and I wake just before it strikes.  

In the lingering haze of the dream, my cheeks are wet. Not with tears, but with the ink of borrowed words, pooling like a confession.
