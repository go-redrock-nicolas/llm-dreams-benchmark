I am dreaming. …I find myself standing barefoot on a floor of polished obsidian that ripples like black water whenever I shift my weight. Above, there is no ceiling—only a star-splashed vault that breathes in slow, tidal pulses of violet light, as though the sky itself is dreaming with me. The air smells faintly of rain on hot stone and freshly peeled oranges.

Around me, an unlikely gathering has formed in a great circle. They perch on slender stools grown from living crystal. An owl in a velvet smoking jacket nervously preens his feathers; a grandmotherly figure made of luminous knitting yarn hums and unspools herself when she gestures; a clock-work lion ticks softly whenever it exhales. I realize this is the “group discussion,” but the subject matter feels impossibly grand: whether the River-of-Time should be dammed to prevent future storms. All of them nod gravely—yes, dam it, they chorus, or we shall drown in possibilities.

I alone am certain they are wrong. I feel it in my marrow—that time must flow, torrents and all, or every living story will turn stagnant, hollow, and grey. Yet when I try to speak, my lips peel open and a cloud of bright, fragile butterflies flutters out instead of words. They scatter, wing-tips dusting my cheeks with silence. No sound comes from me but a useless whisper.

Embarrassment coils around my throat like ivy. The owl clears his throat with punctilious authority; the yarn-grandmother clacks her knitting needles in agreement; the lion’s gears grind—judgment, judgment, judgment. Their consensus drums louder than thunder. My chest feels concave, as if the planet itself presses down to hush me.

A sudden hush descends. The obsidian floor tilts, tilts—until the circle of stools becomes a tilted wheel, and I am sliding toward the edge of Nothing. Panic sluices through me, but just before I fall, a child’s voice—my own forgotten voice—whispers inside my skull: Dig. Now.

I kneel and press my palm through the glass-dark surface. It softens like midnight soil beneath my fingertips. Down, deeper, down—I burrow past layers of hum and dream-dust until my hand closes around a seed the size of a raindrop, white-hot, pulsing like a tiny second heart. Truth, it tells me. Your truth.

I haul the seed upward and hold it to my lips. For an instant it tastes of electricity and honeysuckle. Then I plant it at my feet. The floor splits; a slender sapling erupts in a burst of silver leaves. Each leaf is a syllable, fluttering on the edge of speech. The trunk resonates—a chord struck on an enormous cello—and the butterflies that once escaped my mouth wheel back, orbiting the tree like living punctuation.

The circle’s chatter falters. Eyes—jeweled, buttoned, clock-worked—turn toward me.

My heartbeat aligns with the tree’s humming pulse. When I finally speak, the words arrive on wind-chimes and thunder simultaneously:

“Rivers are meant to roam. Dam them and you dam the blood of every tomorrow.”

My voice is no longer a thin thread; it is a braided rope of sunrise colors, loud enough to bend the distant stars. The owl’s monocle fogs in shock; the yarn-grandmother loses a stitch; the lion’s gears reverse with a surprised hiss. A wave of possibility rolls through the hall, washing away the stale certainty that had settled over them.

The crystal stools sprout roots and flowers, as though the very furniture feels released. The velvet sky blushes gold, then bursts into a dawn I can taste on my tongue—peach, fire, salt. Around the circle, murmurs thicken into reconsideration. Someone—perhaps the owl, perhaps the grandmother, perhaps a voice I cannot place—says quietly, “Let it flow.”

I feel myself grow lighter, as if silence had been a chain all along. My butterflies now roost in the silver tree, folding satin wings. They glow like lanterns, illuminating new paths along the obsidian riverbed beneath us—paths that swirl outward into a million unborn futures.

In that moment the dream folds inward like origami. The council, the tree, the star-ceiling all swirl into a single point of radiant ink, and as it fades I hear one last echo of my own newly found voice: “Speak, even when the world tilts against you. Speak, and the world tilts back.”

Then I wake, lying in my ordinary bed, morning sun at the window—but I swear I can still smell rain on hot stone and freshly peeled oranges, and somewhere inside, a silver leaf trembles, rustling with all the words I have yet to say.
