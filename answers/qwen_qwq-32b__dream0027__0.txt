I am dreaming. My team and I are in a crystal cave beneath a floating city. The air shimmers with bioluminescent spores, and our breathing lights up the space like ghostly halos. The task: activate an ancient levitation matrix before the sky-pirate horde breaches the cavern. I check the holographic schematics projected from my wrist, but something’s off—the symmetry of the crystal nodes is broken. One cluster pulses too fast; another’s glow dims. My second-in-command, Zara, calls over the comms: the northern pillar’s harmonic resonance is destabilizing the energy conduit. I sprint through the labyrinth of glowing stalactites, my boots splashing through pools of liquid starlight. Behind me, the distant vibrations of a leviathan’s roar. We have-seven minutes before the city above collapses. I touch the flawed crystal—it thrums like a trapped heartbeat— and the vision floods my mind: a desert civilization using these very caves to ascend into the sky, their technology forged from stardust and sorrow. Zara’s voice cracks through the comms: energy containment at 23% and failing. I sidestep a falling spore cloud that turns the air to syrup, my finger finding the crystal’s fracture point. With a wrenching twist, the broken node realigns. But as I rise, I see the cavern ceiling splitting—a spectral serpent made of collapsing stars is unspooling from the breach. My team’s faces flicker in my peripherals: Jax mid-scream, Lira’s hands sparking with her gravity defying tech. Time fractures. I seize the central core, channeling every emotion I’ve ever buried—fear of inadequacy, pride in them—and slam my palm into the activation nexus. The matrix flares. The serpent recoils, the city’s hum resumes. We escape as the cavern implodes behind us, the world spinning into a mosaic of stars. When I wake, the taste of stardust lingers, and my hand still tingles where the crystal touched me.
