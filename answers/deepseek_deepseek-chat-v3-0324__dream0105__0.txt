I am dreaming. My eyes flutter open to the golden glow of paper lanterns strung across an ancient wooden courtyard. The scent of sandalwood and roasting tea leaves curls through the air as I sit up from my embroidered futon, my limbs tangled in unfamiliar silk sleep robes. A delicate wind chime sings as the morning breeze carries petals from the cherry tree blooming impossibly just outside my sliding doors - though I'm certain it was winter when I fell asleep.

The polished floor hums with quiet energy beneath my bare feet as I step out onto the veranda, where three generations of my new family are already engaged in their dawn rituals. Grandmother kneels with a samurai's precision as she arranges ikebana flowers glowing with morning dew, their colors too vivid - crimson bleeding into sapphire as if painted with liquid gemstones. My new younger sister, no more than eight, watches me with knowing owl eyes as she practices calligraphy with a brush that leaves shimmering trails in the air.  

A deep gong resonates through the compound, shaking pearlescent carp from the koi pond into brief flight before they dissolve into swirling kanji characters upon hitting the water's surface again. Father appears in the garden wearing a demon mask that shifts expressions - scowling when he looks at my mussed hair, then softening as my hands automatically form the greeting gesture I don't remember learning. 

"Today you'll finally meet the moon priestess," Mother whispers as she adjusts my obi sash, her fingers leaving trails of starlight against the fabric. The silk slithers against my skin of its own volition, stitching constellations along my collar. Through the trembling bamboo grove, I glimpse the temple where my Adoption Ceremony awaits - its stone fox guardians blinking slowly, marble fur rippling in nonexistent wind.  

Somewhere beyond the painted screens, a biwa plays a melody that makes my bones vibrate in ancestral recognition. The dream deepens as I realize with both terror and wonder that these impossible rituals feel more like remembering than learning, and that the reflection in the moon-viewing pool shows a face I've somehow always known.
