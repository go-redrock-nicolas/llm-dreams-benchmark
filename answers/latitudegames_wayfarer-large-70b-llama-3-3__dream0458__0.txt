I am dreaming. Deep in the murky lagoon, I drift suspended in the water. The murky depths stretch endlessly around me, and I struggle toward the sunlit surface.

Breaking through, gasping for breath, I find myself near an ancient vessel. Its timeworn wood creaks in the waves as I swim closer. I catch onto the splintered edge and pull myself aboard. The rough boards dig into my palms as I haul myself up and lie panting on the damp planks.

From this vantage point, I see the world in a new light. I can quite literally see for miles in all directions from atop these timeworn waves. The experience is invigorating and terrifying, like I am taking on the entire world. I think of the long journey that brought me here.

As I catch my breath, I notice these boards may once have been the walkway of an ancient floating pavilion. Time and the relentless tides have splintered it to a remnant. Yet still it endures.

I emerge stronger for the trials I've faced, my perception sharpened and abilities honed through adversity. I sense a newfound capacity lying dormant, waiting to be awakened. I flex my fingers, testing limits, as the planks beneath me shift and groan in the surging waves.

Each breath reveals more - I'm becoming something more than I was before. I feel a vitality flowing through me that I never knew I possessed. My muscles sing with power, my mind sharpens with clarity as the capabilities fully integrate into me. The emerging facets enrich everything I do. I'm transformed by the challenges I didn't want to face, living proof that true strength often lies hidden beneath reluctance.

Journey transformed me. I faced terrors and uncovered depths within myself that I never dreamed possible. The process honed me like steel into something sharp and unbreakable. I figured out how to excel at daunting tests I once shied away from. Now I find myself eager to push even further into uncharted waters.

But even as I sense myself mastering new challenges, I feel a gnawing need for purpose. I begin pacing the length of the waterlogged remains, searching. I pause at the far end and gaze out over the vast waters, reaching toward infinity.

As I stand here, the fragments of a forgotten civilization scattered before me, I know what I must do. I must uncover and preserve the scattered remnants of this lost knowledge, to share with a world that has forgotten. In this moment, I know my true calling.
