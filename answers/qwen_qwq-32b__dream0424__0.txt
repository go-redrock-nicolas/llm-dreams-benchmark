I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself in a boundless forest, where the trees are made of liquid glass that glows faintly blue in the perpetual twilight.  My breath forms swirling mist that rises to merge with the canopy above.  As I walk, my footsteps leave glowing embers that fade into the ground like dying stars.

Suddenly, a pearly-white stag with antlers shaped like fractal puzzles appears.  It speaks in a voice that sounds like wind chimes and static: "The forest mirrors your identity.  Notice how your form changes as you approach others."

I spot a group of figures ahead.  As I approach, my arms elongate, my hands metamorphosing into leaves.  I open my mouth to speak, but only birdsong escapes me.  The figures—some humanoid, others like shifting shadows—are now standing closer.  My skin becomes translucent, revealing a network of glowing veins.  I feel both connected and diminished, an echo in a chamber of many echoes.

The stag gestures to a clearing where a mirrored lake reflects not my image, but possibilities.  Each ripple in the water births a new version of myself: one with wings, another with talons, another faceless yet radiating silent confidence.  The surface catches fire briefly, and when it dies down, the reflection shows a hollow where my heart should be, filled with constellations.

I wake, disoriented, still hearing the reverberation of my fractured identities in the silence of my room.
