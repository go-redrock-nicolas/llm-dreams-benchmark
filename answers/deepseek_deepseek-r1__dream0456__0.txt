I am dreaming. *You stand in a kaleidoscopic labyrinth of shifting walls—not brick or stone, but pulsating clockwork, gears grinding in discordant rhythms.* The air hums with mechanical tension, each tick of unseen clocks vibrating through your ribs. Pressure builds like a vise around your temples, and your thoughts begin to crystallize, sharp and jagged, slicing through possibilities until only rigid paths remain. A corridor narrows ahead, walls squeezing inward, patterned with equations that fracture like ice underfoot.  

***CRACK.***  

The floor splinters into a frozen lake, revealing abyssal waters below. Your reflection stares back—a marionette strung with threads of logic, joints rusted stiff. But then—movement. Chess pieces carved from obsidian and alabaster skitter across the ice, rearranging themselves into constellations you’ve never seen. A rook morphs into a raven, cawing: *"Dissolve the grid."*  

You inhale, and the air tastes of burnt sugar and static. Suddenly, the lake fractures into liquid mercury, shapeshifting beneath you. Equations melt into vines, sprouting bioluminescent orchids that whisper paradoxes. A door appears, warped like a Dali painting, knob pulsing like a heart.  

As you turn it, gears in the walls dissolve into monarch butterflies, flooding the labyrinth with amber light. The pressure lifts. You laugh—a sound like wind chimes—and realize your bones are now made of quicksilver, your thoughts rippling, adaptable, *alive*. The labyrinth reshapes itself into a bridge of mirrors, each reflection a version of you dancing in fractal possibilities.  

A final whisper coils through the air: *"Rigidity drowns. Fluidity flies."*  

You wake, fingertips tingling with the residue of wings.
