I am dreaming. I step into a room that seems both familiar and strange, like an old memory painted with new colors. The walls shimmer with the soft glow of bioluminescent ivy, leaves glowing in hues of cerulean and amethyst. What assumption? I’m thinking. A voice echoes, not from outside but from within. I feel an invisible presence. 

I follow the hum of meaning, walking on a floor that undulates like liquid mercury, cool and yielding beneath my feet. The air smells of rain-soaked earth and blooming jasmine. Suddenly, there’s a garden of translucent figures swaying around me. They call out in unison, Show us how you connect.

I reach a hand toward one, but it phases through… and the figure tremains unchanged. I try to speak—formulate a sentence—, but the words tangle, like syllables in a submarine’s periscope.

The voice intrudes again, pitying? Or hopeful? “Still trying to meet expectations? Whose, dear one?

You. My own. I[the user] suspect.

“Yes. You assume connection requires performance. Choreographed gestures and rehearsed emotions.”

“But how else?!”

“Look closer.”

I blink, and the garden changes. The figures now wear masks modeled after famous faces—celebrities, ancestors, actors. One job? Do what? I ask, but the answer forms in my mind: Remove the mask.

Panic. Resistance. But I pick a mask, touch it, and the plastic—wait, it’s ceramic—crumbles into butterflies. The figure underneath is shapeless, radiant, a pulsing orb of light. 

Others follow, their masks cracking. The ground heaves; the floor becomes a tapestry of threads connecting every soul here—a luminous web glowing gold where connections remain untouched. 

“Now choose: what thread to touch?”

The voice is different—kindlier.
