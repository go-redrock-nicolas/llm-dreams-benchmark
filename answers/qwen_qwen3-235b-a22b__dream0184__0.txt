I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You find yourself standing on a vast plain where the sky is not a sky at all, but a churning ocean of liquid mercury, reflecting a world upside-down. Stars cluster like fireflies in the depths above you, their light flickering in and out of existence as if winking at the absurdity of their own presence. Gravity here is a suggestion, not a law—a breeze might lift you into the air, or a sudden thought of heaviness could pin you to the ground. You take a step forward and land in a forest of crystalline trees whose leaves are made of frozen lightning. They crackle and hum, each bolt a different color depending on the *improbability* of your noticing it. One leaf shifts from violet to gold the moment you stop staring.  

The inhabitants of this realm are creatures stitched together from paradoxes. A fox with wings of smoke and a tail of liquid shadow trots past, its eyes twin hourglasses where sand flows upward. A humanoid figure composed of cascading dominoes pauses to speak to you in a language of thunderclaps and semicolon pauses, their meaning shifting with the tilt of your head. You realize communication here isn’t verbal but probabilistic: understanding blooms when you *almost* grasp their words, then dissolves like mist if you focus too hard.  

Time fractures like light through a prism. You witness a seed un-plant itself, spiraling backward into the soil to become a sapling, then a acorn, then a memory of an acorn. Nearby, a river flows in reverse, carrying fish that are born old and die as eggs. You dip your hand into the water and feel decades slip off your skin, your fingers briefly wrinkling into ancient age before snapping back to youth.  

Certainty is a myth here. The ground beneath you flickers between solid, liquid, and song—each step lands not where you expect, but where you *didn’t* expect. A door materializes ahead, but only when you stop looking for it. You turn away, and it vanishes. You laugh, and the sound crystallizes into butterflies that dissolve mid-flight.  

In the distance, a mountain range breathes. Peaks rise and fall like the chest of a sleeping titan, their slopes littered with clocks that tick in dissonant rhythms. One clock strikes thirteen, and the world shudders—a ripple that turns your hair briefly into ivy. You follow a path paved with dice frozen mid-roll, their numbers changing only when unobserved.  

A library appears, its books bound in moth-wing leather. The pages inside are blank until you forget how to read, at which point they flood with text in a language you’ve never learned but somehow *remember*. The stories shift as you try to comprehend them: a tale of a king who rules only when he abdicates, a poem about a star that dies by being born, a map of cities that exist only when no one walks their streets.  

You meet yourself here—three versions. One is a child made of smoke, weeping sparks. Another is a centuries-old philosopher with your face but no memory of your life. The third is a shadow that claims to be *you* from a timeline where you never existed. They argue in a circle, their voices overlapping until a flock of owls made of origami swallows the sound whole.  

The dream deepens. You fall upward into a cavern of suspended rain, droplets hanging like chandeliers. Each drop contains a miniature universe where *our* laws of physics reign, and the inhabitants there stare skyward, terrified of a world where rain might fall *up*. You reach for one, but it evaporates into a riddle: *“What is the weight of a whisper heard in a scream?”*  

To navigate this realm, you learn to think in spirals, not lines. You abandon logic and embrace the vertigo of the unlikely. You ride a train made of whispers that travels on tracks of forgotten promises. The conductor is a dodo bird with a pocket watch, who stamps your ticket with a date that hasn’t happened yet.  

As dawn threatens the edges of the dream, you stumble upon a garden where flowers bloom only when unwatered, their petals composed of unsent letters and unspoken apologies. You pluck one, and it becomes a key. The key unlocks nothing. Or perhaps it locks everything.  

When you wake, your mind clings to the absurdity like a fever-dream, but fragments linger: the taste of starlight, the ache of a paradox in your bones, the certainty that in some corner of the multiverse, a version of you is still there, laughing at the madness of what we call “reality.”
