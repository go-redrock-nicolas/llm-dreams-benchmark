I am dreaming. The air is thick with the acrid tang of ozone and melted polymers. Control panels flicker like dying stars, their screens bleeding incomprehensible glyphs that squirm when stared at directly. Beneath my boots, the containment floor thrums with a sickly rhythm—not the familiar reactor pulse, but a guttural arrhythmia that travels up my spinal column like mercury ascending a thermometer. Three redundant coolant loops now glow hellmouth-red on the holographic schematics, their emergency bypass protocols crumbling like sandcastles under a tsunami’s tongue. 

In my left ear, an alarm whines through eleven distinct frequencies simultaneously. The backup control room—buried a quarter-mile deep behind depleted uranium blast doors—speaks in a synthesized voice grown unhinged. "Discontinuity event in Decay Heat Removal Core B," it slurs, words bleeding into whale song and static. Through the reinforced viewport, the primary reactor core shimmers like a mirage, its fuel rods warping into fractal patterns that suggest a vast, metallic lung expanding and contracting. Shadows dance too deliberately on the walls, their silhouettes hinting at vertebrae and too many joints.

My fingers move of their own accord across glass touchscreens that weep black viscous fluid. The emergency shutdown protocol demands I inject neutron-absorbing slurry, but the system rejects every authentication code with error messages written in Cyrillic hieroglyphs. A child’s laughter echoes through the ventilation shafts as radioactive steam begins coiling into shapes that mimic human hands—reaching, always reaching. 

The ceiling-mounted Geiger counters sing Byzantine chorales, their needles pinned in the red as reality itself seems to peel away in irradiated layers. Somewhere between the third and fourth containment breach, I realize the facility was never designed to keep radiation *in*.  

It was built to keep something else *out*.
