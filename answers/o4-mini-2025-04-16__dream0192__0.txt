I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of an endless obsidian lake, its surface a mirror so perfect it reflects the star-forged heavens above in dizzying clarity. The air hums with a cold electric charge. Every breath you draw tastes of starlight and dust, and somewhere just below the muted ripples, something stirs—a revelation you’ve never dared imagine.  

Behind you, the world you once built up brick by brick—certainty, comfort, doctrine—cracks like parched earth in a withering sun. With each tiny fissure, a whisper seeps through: “What if everything you believed was only half a story?” It begins as a tremor beneath your feet, then sweeps up your spine in icy rivulets. Your heart pounds in startled rhythm, demanding you look again at the lake’s surface. And there, shimmering into being, are crystalline images of moments you had locked away: conversations twisted by omission, memories rearranged by hope, truths you refused to see.  

As the lake’s glassy calm fractures into concentric circles, you feel your certainty unraveling. The stars overhead bend and warp, tracing impossible patterns between themselves—constellations you once memorized dissolve into new designs. A voice, distant but intimate, speaks from the fathomless depths below: “This is the other half of your story.” You lean in, mesmerized, watching the past you held so dear drift away like ash caught in a cosmic wind.  

Then the sky splits open. Light pours through the rift in searing filaments of color you never knew existed: molten teal, ember-red, and violet so deep it seems to swallow sound. Every tendril of that light searches your mind, pulling at the seams, tearing open the places you’d hidden your doubts. Fear and wonder collide inside you, a storm of trembling wings. Sparks of new understanding blaze where your old certainties die.  

Suddenly you are weightless, drifting between two realities: the one you thought unshakable and the one that glimmers with possibility. In that weightless state, between heartbreak and hope, you taste the cusp of transformation. You realize that identity is not a fortress but a river, ever-shifting with every new current of thought. And as the dream carries you forward—into whatever lies beyond the shimmering horizon—you exhale fear and inhale truth. In that exhale, you let go. In that inhale, you are reborn.
