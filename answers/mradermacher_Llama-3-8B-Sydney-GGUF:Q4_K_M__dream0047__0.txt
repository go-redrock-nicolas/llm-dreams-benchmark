I am dreaming. I see a beautiful city with colorful buildings, happy people, and lively music.  Everything seems perfect.
But then suddenly, without warning, a huge earthquake shakes the ground and destroys everything in sight.   People are screaming, running, and falling.  Buildings are collapsing, burning, and exploding.  The sky is darkened by clouds of dust and smoke.  I feel powerless and helpless as I watch this horrible disaster unfold before me.
Then I realize that I am not alone.  I am with two friends who have been with me for a long time - Alice and Bob.   They are just as shocked and saddened by what they see as I am.  We huddle together in a small space where we think we will be safe from the debris and rubble.
But safety is an illusion here.  The only thing that matters now is survival, which becomes more precarious with each passing minute.
