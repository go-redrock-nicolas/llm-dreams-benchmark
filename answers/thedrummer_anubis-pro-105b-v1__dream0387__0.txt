I am dreaming. The starched sheets pull taut as I differentiate my head lifting over, surrounded by the thriller view that extended through narrow altitudes. Pebbled glass, ashen buildings and levitating swallow charge into view after the hidden sun becomes visible. I yawn, working my fisted hands over my eyes. The timepiece on my end table sets during prompts of rhythmic speckles that flit vigorously. I run my tongue upon the outer sheet of my lips and stretch. After dancing through the tedious ferocity of my floor I brush past the humdrum stringing of action packed raucous voices hanging in humble detail.

Handing teething flashes of structural impulses in moving rays of ontological stasis, unreal. My dream appears reality.

The morning light peeks through the blinds, casting a glow on the cityscape outside my high-rise apartment. I stretch my arms over my head, feeling the warmth radiating from the windows as I take in the breathtaking view. The ashen concrete facades of the neighboring buildings seem to shimmer, their surfaces reflecting the gentle rays of the sun peeking over the horizon. 

My mind feels hazy, remnants of a vivid dream still lingering on the edges of my consciousness. In the dream, I was standing atop a grandiose podium, accepting accolades from an endless sea of faces. Their roars of adoration and admiration resonated through my very being, validating my self-perceived superiority. I was convinced that my exceptional qualities set me apart, that I deserved every bit of special recognition they heaped upon me.

But as I stepped down from the podium, I noticed something peculiar. Amidst the congratulatory claps and smiles, there were whispers, murmured conversations that carried an air of disapproval. Glares shot my way, batch eyes mentoring wide fury. I frowned, perplexed by the disconnect between my self-perception and the way these people saw me.

As I wandered through the crowded room, seeking answers, their criticism grew louder, more forceful. "Self-centric," "Narcissistic," "Entitled." The words stung, striking at the very core of my identity. How could they not see my greatness, my uniqueness?

I found myself standing alone, the raucous voices still echoing in my mind. The dream began to fade, leaving me questioning everything I thought I knew about myself.

As I stand now at the window of my apartment, gazing out at the waking city, I feel a shiver run down my spine. While I'm awake, the ghosts of the nighmares appear to still be active. I mask this by brushed up hair and then venture outdoors to rediscover who I was designed to be.
