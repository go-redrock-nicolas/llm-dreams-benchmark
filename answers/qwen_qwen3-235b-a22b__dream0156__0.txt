I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a city that breathes—but it’s not alive. Towers of glowing screens rise like skeletal skyscrapers, their light bleeding into a bruised-purple sky. The air hums with the static buzz of notifications, a thousand dings and pings that tug at your nerves like invisible strings. You realize your hands are clawed into the air, scrolling phantom feeds that materialize from the mist. Every step you take crunches underfoot, as if walking on shattered glass, but when you look down, you see not shards but fragments of selfies, memes, and headlines, endlessly rearranging themselves into faces you half-recognize—your own among them, distorted and flickering.  

A voice whispers from the screens, familiar yet alien: *“More. More. More.”* It’s not a command but a plea, echoing from every pixel. You turn a corner and stumble into a hall of mirrors, each reflective surface warped and glitching. In one, you see yourself as a child, laughing under a real sun, your face unlit by blue light. In another, a version of you sits hunched in a dim room, a neon glow carving hollows into their cheeks. The reflection’s eyes meet yours, and you feel its exhaustion seep into your bones.  

Suddenly, the ground fractures. You fall—not down, but *through* layers of data. Endless timelines rush past: a thousand versions of your life, each one derailed by a comment, a like, a share. You land in a forest where the trees are made of tangled cables, their leaves tiny screens showing looping videos of strangers’ lives. Vines of Wi-Fi cords snake around your ankles, pulling you deeper. A river nearby doesn’t flow with water but with a slurry of emojis, hashtags, and unread messages. You kneel to touch it, and the sludge clings to your skin, cold and heavy, whispering, *“You’re missing out. You’re invisible.”*  

Then—a shift. A flicker.  

A bird with wings of origami paper soars overhead, dropping a single feather that ignites into flame before settling on the ground. Where it lands, the cables wither, and the soil cracks open to reveal a sprout of vibrant green. You follow the plant’s growth, mesmerized, as it unfurls into a tree with roots plunging into the digital muck, purging it. Its branches bear fruit that glow softly—not screens, but *fireflies*, their light pulsing in rhythms like heartbeats.  

You climb the tree, shedding layers of synthetic skin with every rung. At the summit, you step onto a platform of woven light and see the horizon: a line where the pixelated city ends and a wild, untamed world begins. Mountains rise like fists breaking through a screen, their peaks crowned with clouds that rain actual rain, not data. The wind carries the scent of damp earth and the sound of voices—not filtered through speakers, but raw and overlapping, laughing, crying, *alive*.  

You wake up gasping, your phone vibrating on the nightstand. For once, you let it buzz itself silent. The dream clings to you, its symbols etched into your mind like a warning—or a map. You open your window. The morning is happening outside, unfiltered, unrecorded, and vast.
