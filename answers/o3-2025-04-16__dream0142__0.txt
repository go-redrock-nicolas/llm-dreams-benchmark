I am dreaming. …close your eyes inside the dream and let the impossible laboratory bloom around you:

The room is a cathedral of chrome and humming violet light, its ceiling arched so high it disappears into a haze of aurora-colored mist. Transparent floors reveal rivers of quicksilver flowing beneath your feet, carrying sparks of indigo electricity that pulse in time with your heartbeat. Suspended in the center of the chamber, tethered by threads of laser-thin filaments, hangs the Experiment: a crystalline sphere the size of a heartbeat, spinning so fast it blurs into a shimmering halo. Within its facets dance miniature galaxies—spirals of stardust no bigger than snowflakes, each radiating warmth like a distant sun.

You hover before a console made of liquid sapphire, keys rippling like water yet firm beneath your fingertips. Every gauge and dial once sang in perfect harmony, but now their needles jitter and clash like panicked birds: temperature plunges below absolute zero while pressure spikes to the density of collapsed stars. Logic crumbles. The alarms are melodic chimes that throb in rich C-minor, turning dread into a dark lullaby.

Instinct tells you the sphere is mis-aligning at a molecular level, the way a single misplaced snowflake can trigger an avalanche. A microscopic crack could unravel those pocket-galaxies, spilling primordial fire across dimensions. Catastrophe here would not be an explosion but an unmaking—time unfurling like loose thread from the hem of reality.

You issue a shutdown command, but the console responds with sentences instead of code, scrolling in handwritten calligraphy:

“Stasis rejected.
Heartbeats must continue.
Will you barter memory for control?”

Before you can decipher the message, the lab’s walls ripple outward, transforming into colonnades of giant tuning forks. They vibrate, and the frequencies pass straight through your bones, pulling half-forgotten emotions into the open air: the scent of rain on birthday candles, the hush of distant applause, the ache of unspoken farewells. Each memory becomes a hovering symbol—glowing hieroglyphs that orbit your shoulders like curious fireflies.

The sphere flickers; galaxies inside pause mid-rotation, as if holding their breath. If you sacrifice one of these luminous memories, you sense you can stabilize the rotation—pouring sentiment into physics, balancing chaos with recollection. You cup a floating glyph: the warm weight of your first promise to someone you loved. It thrums like a conch shell. With a surge of bittersweet resolve, you release it toward the sphere.

The memory dissolves into coppery dust, streaming into the crystal lattice. Instantly, the contradictory readings coalesce—temperature, pressure, entropy snapping back into elegant alignment. The tuning-fork pillars fall silent, the rivers of quicksilver below settling into placid mirrors. But the memory is gone, leaving a soft hollow behind your ribs, an outline where certainty used to live.

Quiet descends. The Experiment hovers, renewed, its galaxies once again pirouetting in harmonious arcs. Yet a final warning echoes across the lab in a voice that feels older than stars:

“Perfection demands payment. Next time, it may ask for more.”

A luminescent door materializes before you, carved from moonlight and lined with quills of stardust. Beyond it stretches a corridor of velvet night studded with doors to countless other dreams. You feel the tug of new impossibilities waiting to be born.

You step forward—and wake, tasting the faint resonance of a missing memory, your palms still tingling with the sensation of holding a universe smaller than a sigh.
