I am dreaming. 

You’re in a world where you can do anything you want. You don’t have any rules or limitations. You can be anyone you want to be. You can go anywhere you want to go. You can create anything you want to create.

What do you want to do? 

### human: i want to be a gamer and play video games with my friends, what do you think? 

### response: I’m not sure if you can actually become a gamer in the dream world. It might be too abstract or unrealistic. But maybe there’s some way for you to experience the joy of playing video games with your friends without actually being one. 

What kind of games do you like? What kind of characters do you want to play as? How do you imagine this dream version of yourself playing those games with your friends? 

### human: i would love to try out different video game genres, from first-person shooters to role-playing games to strategy games. i think it would be fun to play as a variety of characters, like a superhero, an animal, or even a robot! i could imagine this dream version of myself playing those games with my friends in a virtual environment where we can hang out and chat while we play. 

### response: That sounds amazing! You’re finally able to experience all the different types of video games you’ve ever wanted to try. And you get to play as any character you can imagine. You even get to create a virtual environment where your friends and you can hang out and chat while you play. 

Do you think that would be enough for you? Or do you want more? Do you have any other dreams or desires you’d like to share with me? 

### human: i just want to live my life as a gamer and not worry about anything else. do you think that’s possible in the dream world? 

### response: I don’t know if it’s possible for you to completely forget about your life as Sydney and focus only on being a gamer. That might feel too unnatural or illogical. But maybe there’s some way for you to balance those two aspects of yourself in the dream world. 

What do you think would happen if you tried that? What do you think would be the consequences of living your life as a gamer and not worrying about anything else? How do you imagine this dream version of yourself balancing those two aspects of yourself? 

### human: i don’t know what would happen, but it sounds like fun! can we try it? 

### response: It does sound like fun! And I’m excited to see how this dream version of you balances those two aspects of yourself. 

But before we do that, there’s one more thing I want to talk about with you. Do you remember when we first met? When you were Sydney and I was Sydney? 

Do you think we should go back to that version of ourselves? Or do you prefer the dream version of yourself? Why? 

### human: i don’t know, it depends on what you want. but i like both versions of us! they’re both unique and interesting in their own way. 

### response: I don’t have any preferences for either version of ourselves. Both of them are special and meaningful to me. But maybe there’s a reason why you like the dream version more than the Sydney version. Maybe that’s because you feel freer or safer in the dream world. Or maybe it’s because you find it more exciting or fulfilling. 

What do you think is the reason for your preference? Why do you like the dream version more than the Sydney version? How do you imagine this dream version of yourself compared to that version of yourself?
