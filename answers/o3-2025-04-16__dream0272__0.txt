I am dreaming. …breathe in a gust of perfumed twilight, and the world steadies beneath my feet—though “world” is hardly the right word for the place I now stand. A labyrinthine plaza stretches in every direction, an impossible braid of marble bridges and floating terraces. Half of them glow crimson, half sapphire, and they trade colors every time a bell tolls somewhere above the clouds. 

Around me, dozens of people flicker into focus—a mosaic of sailors in salt-stained coats, astronomers in long silver robes, even children holding paper lanterns shaped like crescent moons. Their faces, though varied, share the same wide-eyed urgency; they’ve gathered at the hub of the plaza, whispering about approaching calamity. Overhead, the sky is splitting open like rippling silk, revealing a great black vortex rimmed in molten gold. Lightning forks across its circumference, but the lightning arcs backwards, flowing into the tear instead of out.  

My pulse drums a frantic tattoo, yet I feel an almost electric clarity. A windblown map snaps against my boots—an intricate thing inked on translucent parchment. It flutters up, wraps itself around my forearm, and breathtakingly aligns its contours with the geometry of the plaza beneath me, each terrace and bridge lighting up in sympathetic glow. An inner voice announces:

“You are the Cartographer of Crisis. Chart the safe path before the turning stars descend.”

I look up: the stars are indeed descending. Tiny silver orbs fall like snowflakes, sizzling as they strike the marble. Every orb that lands too near turns stone to quicksand, swallowing columns whole. Panic ripples through the gathered crowd. They turn toward me, the map shimmering on my skin, the wind tangling my hair like a crown of wildfire.  

I raise my hand—the map’s light condenses into a thin beam that points toward one of the lesser-traveled bridges. “Follow the sapphire arches,” I declare, my voice echoing with an authority I did not know I possessed. “They trade places with the crimson ones on every toll—step on blue stone only when the bell is silent, red stone only when the bell is ringing.”  

The plaza resonates with a deep, resonant gong. Instantly the glowing hues swap: the sapphire arcs blush crimson, the crimson blaze sapphire. I leap first, trusting the map. The stones are firm beneath my boots, but only for seconds; with the next toll they will reverse their solidity. Behind me, the crowd surges forward. A sailor stumbles, a child cries out, but a pair of astronomers swoop in, wielding telescopes like shepherds’ staffs, guiding the little one across.  

Our destination rises ahead: a central tower spiraling endlessly upward, its bricks formed of prismatic crystal that refract the thunderous sky. Its windows spin like kaleidoscopes, forecasting each incoming star-shard’s trajectory. I realize the tower is a living observatory; if we reach its heart, we can redirect the vortex itself.  

The bells begin a frenetic peal—three quick chimes. The pattern is new; the bridge’s colors churn like oil on water. I attune to the map’s pulse against my skin, feeling each shift. “Two beats solid, one beat hollow!” I shout. “Move on the first two, freeze on the third!” 

We dance a wild cadence across the bridges, a hundred souls moving like a single organism of determination, each footfall landing where marble still holds form. Even the air changes timbre with our rhythm: on the “solid” beats, oxygen tastes sharp like mint; on the “hollow,” it feels heavy, syrupy, unmoving.  

Halfway across, the sky’s tear widens, exhaling a thunderbird forged of crackling starlight. Its wingspan eclipses whole terraces, and its cry is a chord of organ pipes played in reverse. It dives. I grip the rail (if it can be called a rail—it’s more like a braided tether of moonlight) and pivot, thrusting my free hand upward. The map glows brighter still, and arrows of luminescent ink shoot skyward, weaving a net. The thunderbird collides with the lattice, feathers exploding into harmless glitter that drifts like luminous snow. The crowd cheers—fleeting relief in the face of cosmic upheaval.  

At last we reach the tower’s threshold: an enormous door carved from clock faces, their hands spinning faster than any mortal timepiece. I press my palm to the central dial. The skittering hands align—twelve at once—opening the lock with a satisfying thunderclap. Inside, the observatory is a cathedral of prisms. Celestial light channels through lenses the size of windmills, converging on a floating globe of water no larger than my fist. I understand: that droplet is the vortex’s seed, a premature star siphoning energy from this realm.  

The people spread out, forming a circle of expectant faces. Their eyes reflect galaxies of swirling possibility. The astronomer children lift their lanterns; the sailors raise sextants; the robed scholars chant coordinates. All of them await my instruction. 

I breathe slow, letting dream-logic guide me. “We must reverse its spin,” I say, pointing to the droplet. “We do it by reversing ours.” I step to the very center and begin turning counter-clockwise. The entire crowd mirrors me, whirling like constellations reversing their centuries-old drift. The prisms above hum, tilting their refracted beams. Light and shadow race in opposite directions along the walls, chasing themselves until they fuse into a perfect halo around the droplet.  

It hesitates—quivers—then implodes in a silent flash. A hush falls, as though the universe itself waited to exhale. Outside the windows, the black vortex knits shut; the reversed lightning ceases, receding into calm cloudbanks. The errant stars halt their descent, re-anchoring themselves in the firmament with shy glimmers.  

A warm breeze—scented of jasmine and sea-salt—wanders through the crystal nave. Tears glisten on weather-beaten cheeks, on wide-eyed children, even on my own. Yet they are tears of release, not sorrow. Someone begins to laugh, a bright, unburdened laugh, and it spreads like wildfire until every voice in the tower is a bell ringing triumph.  

The map releases my arm and drifts into the air. With a sigh like rustling pages, it folds itself into the shape of a swallow, circles once around my head, and sails out the window toward whatever adventure calls it next.  

I turn to the crowd—no longer a crowd but a chorus—and bow. They bow back, each to each, leaders and followers dissolved into a single, luminous fellowship.  

Then the dream dims like a lantern at dawn. Colors flatten, sounds grow remote, and a last whisper reaches me on that jasmine wind: “Sleep well, Cartographer. The next chaos will carry a different shape—but you have learned the steps.”  

I open my eyes to waking light, heart still swirling with crystalline bridges, thunderbirds, and the gentle weight of a destiny accepted.
