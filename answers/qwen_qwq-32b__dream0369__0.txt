I am dreaming. I am standing in a vast, sunlit meadow, where the grass is a kaleidoscope of emerald green and gold, shimmering like liquid metal. The air hums with the resonant energy of something magical. Suddenly, a large, iridescent dragon flies overhead, its wingspan casting a shadow that feels like a velvet caress.  My pulse quickens as it lands nearby, its scales shifting colors like an aurora borealis. Before I can react, the dragon speaks in a voice that rumbles deep in my chest but carries a melodic, celestial overtone. “Mortals rarely see my kin and live,” it says, “but you… you are different.”  It tilts its head, and I realize its eyes are twin supernovas, endless and abyssal, yet alive with awareness. 

Before I can speak, the ground trembles. A fissure splits the earth behind me, revealing a swirling vortex of liquid starlight. The dragon snarls, a sound that shakes the very roots of the meadow. “Hasten!” it urges. As I stumble toward it, time warps. The meadow dissolves, replaced by a cavern lined with glowing crystals that pulse in sync with my heartbeat. The dragon morphs into a humanoid figure with scales that shimmer like the original dragon’s, offering me a choice: retrieve a shattering hourglass from a pedestal or flee back to the waking world. 

I reach for the hourglass, but my hand passes through it. The figure’s voice echoes in my mind: “Only the unbroken can mend what’s fractured.” Realization darts through me—I must first heal my own heart’s fissures. The cavern fades, replaced by a memory: a sun-drenched childhood home, laughter echoing, then a door slamming, words left unspoken, a heart splitting like glass. 

Blinking, I’m back in the cavern. The figure nods, knowing. The crystals dim as shadows congeal into serpentine shapes, slithering toward us. “Hurry,” it whispers. As the first shadow strikes, I channel that moment of self-reflection from my waking dream—the pause before reaction—and with it, a warmth blooms in my chest. The warmth hardens into a shield of light, repelling the serpents. The hourglass solidifies in my grasp. 

Twirling, I flip it over. The starlight within resumes its flow. The cavern collapses into a pinpoint of light, the dragon soars upward with a roar that’s a symphony of raw power and grace, and I wake, heart pounding, fingertips tingling as if still holding that celestial sands.\n
