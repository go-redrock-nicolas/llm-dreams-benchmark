I am dreaming. …I keep drifting, and the dream swells back to life like ink blooming through water.

I am walking along an impossible shoreline—sand the color of moonlight, surf that rolls in as shimmering violet glass. Each wave crashes with the hush of pages turning, as though the ocean itself is made of unwritten stories. Ahead, an ornate pavilion rises where sea meets sky: spiraling columns of silver coral support a roof woven from translucent feathers. Lantern-jellyfish drift above it, pulsing with soft aquamarine light, and somewhere far off a choir of mechanical larks ticks in perfect harmony.

Inside this airy temple stand dozens of figures, each wrapped in mirrors instead of cloth. Some mirrors are polished obsidian, absorbing all light; others are cracked and mended with gold veins; still others ripple like mercury. Whenever I fix my gaze on one, the reflections rearrange until they show not the figure’s face, but mine—expressions I deny in waking life cycling across the mirrored skin.

One mirrored stranger steps forward. The surface shows me as smug, nose tilted, mouth curled. I feel an immediate spike of irritation—arrogance! How dare they parade my likeness in such conceit? A quiet gong reverberates overhead, and the pavilion’s coral pillars resonate like tuning forks. The sound reminds me: I have been here before, pointing a stern finger at a ghost that is, in truth, my own shadow.  

Recognizing the projection pattern, I take a breath that tastes of salt and moonlight, and I choose a different response. Instead of bristling, I bow. The moment my spine curves, the stranger’s mirrored body liquefies into a silvery tide that seeps across the floor, swirling around my ankles. It feels neither wet nor dry, but absolutely weightless—merely possibility. Whisper-thin tendrils climb my calves and settle over my heart, merging with me in a gentle shiver.

The pavilion rotates, like the whole world has become a slow-moving kaleidoscope. New figures appear: one reflecting my hidden envy, another my buried fear of failure, a third radiating the raw impatience I scold in everyone else. With each of them I repeat the ritual—bow, acknowledge, embrace. Each time they dissolve into that silver tide and weave themselves into the fabric of my dream-self, I feel subtly re-calibrated, less splintered. The tide coalesces at my sternum, condensing into a small, perfect orb that glows with dawn-colored light.

Outside, the violet-glass waves begin to shift hue, turning gold, then opalescent pink. The mirror-figures thin out until I stand alone in the pavilion, orb in hand. A hush falls over the dreamscape. I sense—rather than see—a door behind the coral pillars, nothing more than a vertical shimmer in space. Curiosity hums through me, but so does a fissure of doubt: What aspects of myself lurk beyond that threshold, still unacknowledged? My pulse is sudden thunder.

Yet the orb in my palm warms, steady and reassuring. I grasp the doorknob made of condensed starlight and push.  

On the other side: a hallway of hanging gardens, plants sprouting from gravity-defying arches. Bioluminescent vines coil around me like welcoming serpents, their glow matching my heartbeat. Ahead, a figure takes shape—no longer a mirror, but a being of sheer prism light. I know, instinctively, it is the integrated sum of every trait I have absorbed so far.

“You’re learning not to flinch from your own reflection,” the prism-being intones, voice like wind chimes caught in a solar storm. “Are you ready to meet what comes next?”

I nod. The orb dissolves into a radiant mist and settles into my chest, flaring outward like wings.

And in that instant I wake—heart pounding, cheeks damp, oddly exhilarated. The morning light sneaks around my curtains, and I sense a subtle shift, as if the dream’s silver tide is still swirling inside me, waiting to guide my next waking judgment toward empathy rather than projection.
