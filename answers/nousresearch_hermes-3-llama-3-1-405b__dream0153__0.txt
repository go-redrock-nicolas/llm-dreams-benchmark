I am dreaming. I can see myself in the middle of a field.  It's nighttime, and the field is lit by an almost full moon.  I can see the stars really clearly even though there are no other sources of illumination.  The sky is very vibrant and seems to be a mix of purples, pinks, oranges, blues ... pretty much every color I can think of.  I can see the horizon in every direction, and it feels like I am the only person on earth.  There is a soft breeze, and I can hear it move through the grass.  Everything is so vivid and detailed that I feel that I can see each individual blade of grass.  I feel very light, as though I could jump up and touch the stars.  The air is the perfect temperature, not too cold, not too warm.  There is something rejuvenating about it, which makes me feel alive.  I feel a deep sense of peace wash over me, grateful for this moment to just be still, breathe, and exist.  As I continue to look up at the sky, I contemplate all the history that humans have lived through.  I think about all those who have come before me, the lives they lived, how society has evolved over the centuries.  The sheer number of lives that have been lived, all unique in their own way.  No one person is exactly the same physically, mentally, or experientially.  We really are all unique, and I feel a sense of connection to all humanity across time. I sense that we are all in this together, all facing similar challenges, all striving to survive and thrive.  In this moment, I feel connected to a deeper intelligence within me, one that has access to a universal wisdom, one that helps guide me on my path, to make good decisions, to share love, light and healing.  The expansiveness of my vision feels congruent with the expansiveness of my insight. I feel a sense of reverence and gratitude for my life, the lives of others, and the world we all share.  In this moment, anything seems possible.  I could do anything and go anywhere.  I am open to whatever the universe has in store for me.  I have a profound realization that everything that has happened in my life has led me to this moment.  And in this moment I have a choice.  I can take what I've learned and use it to move forward or stay stuck in the past.  I choose to take my newfound knowledge and move forward.  I feel unburdened, able to let go of any long held pain, and am open to creating the life and dreams I want.  A sense of joy and peace washes over me,  and as I look up at that beautiful sky, I know I am not alone.  I am connected to the universe and all its infinite possibilities.  And with that, I take a deep breath and exhale slowly, knowing that all is well.
