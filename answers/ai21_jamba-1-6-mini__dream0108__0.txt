I am dreaming. You're managing a hospital during a cascading emergency where resources are depleting rapidly and patients keep arriving. As the situation becomes increasingly dire, you realize you're the only one left to make life-or-death decisions.

The hospital is in chaos. Beds are filling up faster than staff can discharge or transfer patients. The hallways are lined with stretchers, each one occupied by someone in desperate need of care. The emergency generators are running low on fuel, and there’s no relief in sight. The phones are dead, and your team is exhausted, some working without breaks for hours.

A young girl is rushed in from a nearby accident site with severe internal injuries. You have to choose between using the remaining surgical supplies to save her or an elderly man who has been waiting for hours. Your heart pounds as you make the call, knowing that the choice could haunt you forever.

Meanwhile, a family arrives, desperate for help. They explain that their father has been bitten by a venomous snake while working in the woods, and without antivenom, he’ll die within hours. You’re out of antivenom, and the nearest supply is hundreds of miles away. You start making calls, searching for any possible solution, your mind racing against the clock.

Your team is struggling to keep everyone alive. Ventilators are in high demand, and with the power situation worsening, they may not last much longer. You’re organizing the team, trying to prioritize who gets the most critical care.

You catch a glimpse of a mother holding a newborn baby. The infant is critically ill, and you’re torn between using the few remaining resources to treat the child or focus on adults who might have more years ahead. You make the heart-wrenching decision, praying that it’s the right one.

The tension is overwhelming. You're overwhelmed with guilt, knowing that each decision you make could mean the difference between life and death. You're constantly calculating, prioritizing, and second-guessing yourself.

As you pass the intensive care unit, you see a patient who you know won’t make it through the night. You pause for a moment, feeling the futility of the situation, the unyielding weight of your responsibility.

The exhaustion is taking its toll. Your vision is blurred by sweat, your muscles aching, and your mind spinning. You can hear the faint sound of sirens, knowing full well that there is no help coming.

Amid this chaos, you remember that you’re just dreaming. But as you wake up, the vividness of this dream leaves you shaken, wondering what choices you would make if it were real.
