I am dreaming. I am walking through a forest that is unlike any other. The trees are metallic, glistening like liquid silver, and their leaves shimmer with bioluminescent patterns that shift like constellations. The air is thick with the scent of something sweet and spicy—burning sugar and amber. The ground beneath my feet is made of smooth obsidian, but it is warm to the touch, almost alive.

As I walk, I notice that the trees are not stationary. They are growing, twisting, and changing shape right before my eyes. One moment, a tree might look like a normal column of silver, the next, it has twisted into a shape that resembles a coiling serpent or a dancing figure. The bioluminescent patterns on their leaves are reacting to my presence. When I move closer, the patterns brighten, pulsing in time with some unseen heartbeat. When I move away, they dim like distant stars.

I come across a clearing in the forest. In the center stands a giant, ancient tree with a trunk that seems to span centuries. Its roots delve deep into the earth, and its branches reach toward the sky, touching the horiz ánh chuyn).<beginofsentence># 3.6.26 What is 4 radians in degrees?

To convert 4 radians to degrees, we use the conversion factor \( \frac{180^\circ}{\pi \text{ radians}} \). Multiplying 4 radians by this factor:

\[
4 \text{ radians} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi \text{ radians}} = \frac{720^\circ}{\pi}
\]

For a numerical approximation, using \( \pi \approx 3.1415926535 \):

\[
\frac{720}{3.1415926535} \approx 229.18^\circ
\]

**Answer:**  
\( 4 \) radians is approximately \( 229.18^\circ \), or exactly \( \frac{720}{\pi} \) degrees.
