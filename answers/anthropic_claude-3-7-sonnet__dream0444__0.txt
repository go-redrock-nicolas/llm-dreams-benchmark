I am dreaming. I find myself wandering through a labyrinth of weathered stone, where impossible staircases curl upward like question marks against a twilight sky of shifting purples and deep cerulean blues. The air smells of salt and distant spices I cannot name, carrying whispers of conversations I feel I should remember but cannot quite grasp.

Suddenly, a figure appears beside me—neither man nor woman but somehow both and neither—with eyes that reflect galaxies and skin that seems to ripple like water catching moonlight. They walk beside me without introduction, as though we've known each other eternally.

"You've been avoiding the western tower," they say, pointing to a spiral structure that somehow I hadn't noticed before, though it now dominates the horizon.

"I don't know what's there," I reply, though deep within I feel a trembling recognition.

"Only the parts of yourself you've locked away," they answer with a smile that carries both comfort and challenge. "The painter you abandoned at twelve, the wild dancer you never allowed yourself to become, the voice that sings only when you think no one listens."

As we approach the tower, I notice it's constructed entirely of objects from my past—childhood books, instruments I briefly played, letters I never sent, embraces I withdrew from too quickly. My companion traces their fingers along these artifacts, and they illuminate at their touch.

We climb together in comfortable silence, and with each step, I feel myself both lighter and more substantial. At the summit, a circular room opens before us, its walls transparent, revealing a cosmos of possibilities spinning around us like an intimate planetarium.

"This is where your unlived lives reside," they whisper. "Not as regrets, but as potential still waiting within you."

I realize then that this guide is no stranger but a part of me—the intuition I've repeatedly silenced, the wisdom I've overlooked, the courage I've denied.

As we stand together watching constellations of my own creation dance around us, I understand that integration doesn't mean choosing one self over another, but embracing the magnificent multiplicity that has always existed within me.

I wake with tears on my face, but they are not tears of sadness. They are recognition of something profound and beautiful that has always been there, waiting for me to simply turn toward it and say, "I see you now."
