I am dreaming. The air hums with anticipation as I step into the gleaming operating theater, the floor tiles immaculately white beneath my feet. Around me, a sea of faces stares in expectation - the lead surgeons, nurses, and technicians, their expressions a stew of concern and curiosity. At the center of the room, a patient lies prone on the table, their body draped in sterile green cloth, leaving exposed only the delicate cranium that presents the site of the operation.
At that moment, a realization strikes me like a slap in the face: I am to perform an intricate procedure on the human brain, something that takes experts decades to master. As I glance around, my heart sinks. Not one person here expects me to succeed, fearing for the safety of the patient. Nervously, I reach for the scalpel.
The next few moments pass as if in a dream. I am in a trance, moving with a strange, fluid grace that I have never known in waking life. The scalpel seems to guide itself, slicing open the skin with surgical precision. Salient organs part before the tip like pages of a book. I remove one piece after another with the practiced ease of a veteran brain surgeon. All the while, I marvel at my own composure, as if I had been performing these procedures in my sleep.
When I have finished and the patient is moved to recovery by the awestruck surgical team, I awaken, my own heart pounding in my ears. Mercifully, I am in my bed and the brain operation has happened only in my dreams.
