I am dreaming. It’s a lucid dream. But my subconscious is pulling the strings and I can’t seem to control the flow, which is fueling my discomfort. The airport gates keep shifting, their letters writhing like serpents. The flight monitors flicker between numbers and symbols I don’t recognize. I check my ticket again, but the destination is written in an alien script. A cold panic seizes me. Time’s running out. The floor starts to ripple like liquid. People around me are faceless, blurred. A voice over the intercom booms in a language that feels ancient, echoing through the hollow chambers of the terminal. My breath hitches. How do I escape this labyrinth?
Ah, the ceiling is melting again. I can feel the antiseptic airport air crystallizing in my lungs as gate B23 bleeds into a hieroglyph, oily and shimmering like beetle wings. My shoes sink into carpet that’s become hot marshmallow foam. A janitor mops the same patch of floor—his bucket frothing with bioluminescent squid ink, tendrils creeping toward my ankles. Every flicker of the Departures board rewrites the physics of this place: now Cyrillic numerals drip like candle wax, now Aztec day signs pulsating in migraine purple. A scent hits me—burnt cardamom and diesel—as the duty-free shop morphs into a bazaar peddling clocks with backwards hands, their glass faces crammed with live scarabs. I’m running but my briefcase has grown teeth, gnawing at my wrist. The boarding pass dissolves into papyrus, edges curling to reveal a map of my own branching capillaries. When the ceiling speakers howl in Sumerian, I realize with ice-water clarity: the conference I’m missing isn’t on forensic accounting. It’s the cosmic symposium where all versions of me convene to vote on which timelines get erased. The janitor winks, holding up his mop like a scepter. Liquid shadows swallow Gate .
