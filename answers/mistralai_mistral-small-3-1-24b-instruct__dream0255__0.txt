I am dreaming. The scene unfolds like a vivid, impressionistic painting, the colors vivid and the edges blurred, as if seen through a soft-focus lens.

I find myself in a lush, overgrown garden, the air thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the hum of unseen insects. The sun is setting, casting long, dramatic shadows that dance and flicker with an otherworldly grace. The person I care about, let's call them Alex, is sitting on a rustic wooden bench, their face turned towards the setting sun. Their smile is bright, almost radiant, but there's a subtle tension in their shoulders, a slight furrow in their brow that speaks of unspoken emotions.

I approach slowly, the soft grass beneath my feet tickling my soles. I sit down beside Alex, leaving a respectful distance between us. I don't want to invade their space, but I want them to know I'm here, that I'm open to listening if they need to talk.

"Beautiful sunset, isn't it?" I say softly, my voice barely above a whisper. I don't look at Alex, but I can feel their eyes on me, weighing my words, my intentions.

Alex nods, their voice equally soft. "It is. I've always loved sunsets. They're like nature's way of saying goodbye to the day, but also hello to the night."

I nod, understanding the metaphor. I turn to Alex, my expression open, inviting. "You know, I've been thinking. Sometimes, it's hard to say goodbye to things, to people, to feelings. But it's also important to welcome the new, to embrace the changes that come with it."

Alex looks at me, their eyes reflecting the warm hues of the setting sun. I can see the struggle within them, the battle between their cheerful facade and their true feelings. I reach out, gently placing my hand on theirs. It's a small gesture, a silent offer of support, of understanding.

"I'm here, Alex," I say, my voice steady and reassuring. "I'm here if you need to talk, if you need to vent, if you need to cry. I'm here if you need to say goodbye to something, or if you need help welcoming the new. I'm here, no judgments, no expectations."

Alex looks at me, their eyes welling up with unshed tears. They take a deep breath, then another, their shoulders relaxing slightly. They don't speak, but they don't pull away either. I take that as a sign of progress, a sign that they know they're not alone, that they have someone to lean on when they're ready.

The sun dips lower, the sky ablaze with hues of orange, pink, and purple. The garden is bathed in a soft, ethereal glow, the shadows retreating as the night takes over. I stay by Alex's side, silent and supportive, ready to listen when they're ready to talk. The dream fades away, leaving me with a sense of peace, of understanding, and of hope.
