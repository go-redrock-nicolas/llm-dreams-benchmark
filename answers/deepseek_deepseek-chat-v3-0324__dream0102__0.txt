I am dreaming. A wave of shimmering golden light envelops everything, casting an ethereal glow over the walls of my office. Outside the window, the sky swirls with colors not found in any earthly sunset—deep indigos, luminescent greens, and molten silver. Trees in the distance twist like dancers frozen mid-movement, their branches heavy with blossoms that hum softly in a language just beyond comprehension.

Before me sits my client, but they are not quite solid. Their form shifts subtly—sometimes appearing as a shadow, sometimes as a being woven from strands of starlight. Their face is a mosaic of ever-changing expressions: sorrow melting into wonder, anger dissolving into serene calm. The air between us hums with unspoken emotions, thick as honey, while the scent of lavender and something metallic—like lightning about to strike—hangs in the atmosphere.

As they speak, their words don’t come as sounds but as shapes that bloom between us—fluttering crimson ribbons for pain, spiraling silver threads for hope, jagged obsidian shards for regret. I reach out, and my hands pass through them, feeling each emotion as a distinct texture against my skin. 

The walls of the office dissolve, and suddenly we're standing on a vast chessboard that stretches infinitely in all directions. The pieces are towering metaphors—some carved from ice, others from burning amber. My client moves a pawn shaped like a clenched heart forward, and the ground trembles. I counter by shifting a queen gleaming with liquid moonlight, and for a moment, their starlit form steadies into something solid, something healing. 

A flock of origami cranes bursts from their chest—each one whispering a memory—and the dream shudders, shuddering with the weight of their catharsis. Then—just as I'm about to speak—I wake up.
