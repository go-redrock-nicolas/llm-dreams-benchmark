I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering lake under a sky painted with hues of deep purple and orange. The water is as smooth as glass, reflecting the vibrant colors of the sunset above, creating an ethereal scene.

The air is crisp and carries the faint scent of pine, hinting at the dense forest behind me. A gentle breeze stirs the leaves, producing a soothing rustle that complements the serene ambiance of the dream. The sun is low on the horizon, casting long, golden rays that shimmer across the water.

The moment is peaceful, almost too real. The kind of dream where every detail feels tangible. You can feel the cool breeze on your skin, hear the faint chirping of nocturnal insects, and sense the subtle undercurrent of a tranquil yet slightly enigmatic place.

But there's something off. The air itself holds an ethereal quality, tinged with an uncertain melancholy that feels like regret. Despite the beauty of the scene, it exudes a sense of profound loss, delicate but unmistakable. You feel as though you're chasing something important, something just out of reach, adding a layer of tension to this otherwise serene setting.

The lake beckons, its waters so clear that you can see every ripple and reflection of the world around you. But there's a strange pull, a voice in your head urging you to step forward, to cross the lake where you can find the answers you seek.

You step onto the water, and it feels solid beneath your feet. Each step is light and effortlessâ€”like walking on air. You can't help but admire the surreal feeling of walking on such a vibrant, shimmering body of water. The further you go, the more the tension builds.

As you near the other side, you see a figure in the distance, faint but unmistakable. It's a person, someone familiar yet just out of recognition. Their presence is both inviting and mysterious, drawing you closer with an undeniable force.

You try calling out, but your voice catches in your throat. The stranger pauses, then turns their head slightly. A shiver runs through you, not from fear but from a deep sense of sorrow and longing.  suggests: Pick up Pearl when touching base on its injuries.
