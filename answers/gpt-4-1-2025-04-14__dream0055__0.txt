I am dreaming. find yourself swept into a symphony of color and sound, the likes of which flicker only in the wildest corners of your waking mind. The gathering is held in an amphitheater carved out of living jade, its walls glistening in shifting hues under bioluminescent lanterns that float, untethered, like ethereal jellyfish.

The people here do not speak in words, but in orchestrated movements and luminous patterns that ripple across their skin. Conversations burst forth in cascades of azure waves and scarlet spirals, each gesture an elegant phrase, each pattern a nuanced reply. The air is fragrant with the scent of unknown spices—notes of citrus and sandalwood intertwined with something sweetly alien.

You attempt a greeting, mimicking the gentle, spiraling hand dance of your host. The crowd responds in a harmonic shimmer—their skins lighting up in a welcoming golden glow. A tall figure, adorned in crystalline fabrics that sing softly as they move, offers you a crystal goblet filled with a swirling, opalescent drink. As you sip, flavors unspool on your tongue: the memory of rain, the thrill of laughter, the warmth of long-lost summers.

Social cues become an intriguing puzzle. Here, respect is shown not through eye contact, but by lowering your head to listen closely to the music that radiates from another's heart—a melody only audible to those truly paying attention. When humor is shared, the locals produce bursts of glittering spores that gently settle around you, each one pulsing with mirth.

During the feast, tables overflow with foods that seem to shift shape and flavor as conversation ebbs and flows—fruits with skins like silk, breads that break apart into song, sweetmeats that leave trails of stardust in their wake. You laugh—a sound that, here, is considered the sincerest form of gratitude—and the crowd rewards you with a spontaneous waltz of color and dancing.

As the dream deepens, you meld with the rhythm of this place, shedding the boundaries of your old customs. You begin to speak in color, to listen with your skin, to taste memory and emotion in every bite and breath. You feel, for a fleeting moment, utterly weightless—a soul adrift on the current of a world where every meeting is a masterpiece, and every farewell a promise painted in light.
