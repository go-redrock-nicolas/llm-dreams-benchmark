I am dreaming. I find myself in a grand circular chamber with walls that seem to shift between translucent crystal and smoky obsidian. Around an enormous table carved from what appears to be a single piece of opalescent stone sit twelve figures, their features constantly morphing like oil on water. As I observe them from my elevated position, I notice threads of light connecting each participant - some golden and bright, others dark and writhing like angry serpents.

The delegates speak in voices that carry multiple tones simultaneously - their public words ringing clear and diplomatic while underlying whispers reveal darker motives. A representative from what seems to be an underwater civilization drips perpetually onto the floor, their water forming patterns that spell out their true intentions. Across from them, a figure wreathed in shifting shadows presents a peace treaty while their darkness reaches out like tendrils beneath the table to grasp at secret documents.

The air grows thick with tension as layers of truth peel away like gossamer veils. I can suddenly taste the lies - they're metallic and sweet, floating in the air like visible motes of dust. Each time someone speaks, their words take physical form, splitting into multiple colored streams that tell different stories.

The chamber itself seems to react to the mounting deception - the walls pulse with a rhythmic glow, and the ceiling begins to lower imperceptibly. In my dream-logic, I understand that if the negotiations don't reach a point of genuine truth soon, we'll all be crushed by the weight of our own duplicity.

A small object at the center of the table catches my attention - a perfectly clear sphere that gradually fills with swirling colors as each new lie is told. The participants either don't notice it or pretend not to, but I watch in fascination as it approaches a critical mass of chromatic chaos...

The dream maintains its lucid intensity, every detail sharp and significant, as the intricate dance of deception continues to unfold in this supernatural diplomatic arena.
