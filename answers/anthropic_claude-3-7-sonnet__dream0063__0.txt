I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast amphitheater of impossible architecture, where staircases spiral in Escher-like patterns both above and below me. Around me stand circles of people from different eras and cultures, each speaking to me in their native tongue. To my left, a Renaissance philosopher debates ethics in flowing Italian; to my right, a Maya astronomer explains celestial patterns in ancient Yucatec. Behind me, a quantum physicist speaks rapid Japanese while gesturing at equations that float in the air like luminous butterflies.

I understand them all perfectly, my mind somehow operating in multiple linguistic channels simultaneously. My fingers trace equations in the air—glowing fractals that represent a mathematical truth I'm desperately trying to solve. Each conversation feeds into this equation, becoming variables and constants that shift and morph.

The amphitheater begins to pulse with light as my mental capacity stretches. The voices grow more urgent, more demanding. The equation expands before me, a constellation of symbols that seems to hold the answer to something profound and essential.

The pressure builds in my temples. The languages begin to blend—Arabic flowing into Swahili flowing into Mandarin—while the mathematics grows more complex, the symbols reshaping themselves into patterns I've never seen before. I feel my consciousness expanding, stretching beyond its normal boundaries, reaching for something just beyond my grasp...
