I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of lavender and something metallic, like fresh rain on a storm-swept highway. My fingers brush against a surface that's both warm and cool at the same time, like holding a stone heated by the moon. Somewhere in the distance, a carousel plays a melody that loops backward and forwards, disorienting my sense of time. As I walk forward, the ground shifts underfoot—suddenly, I'm ankle-deep in liquid glass that shimmers with galaxies trapped within. Stars are winking with every step. Above me, the sky drips honey that hardens into suspended golden threads. A voice whispers in a language that feels like home, though I've never heard it before. It says: "You are not just seeing; you are becoming the landscape." As I stretch my hands upward toward a cluster of bioluminescent ferns, their spores catch on my sleeves and begin pulsating like tiny hearts. Suddenly, the carousel isn't there anymore; it transforms into a swarm of sentient paper cranes, each with a different fortune written in invisible ink that activates when I pass by. My shadow lengthens unnaturally, stretching into a writhing vine that uproots itself to follow me. Every heartbeat makes the world bend—walls curve like waves, while a fountain made of shattered starlight fills the air with tiny prisms that settle in my hair. In one pocket, a clock made of songbirds ticks melodies instead of time, and in the other, a key shaped like a seashell unlocks doors that lead to nowhere I can fathom. The floorboards beneath us growl like ancient alligators as we move, but the sound carries the song of a lost civilization's lullaby. My breath becomes mist that lingers then evaporates, leaving behind faint tracings of hieroglyphics. The farther we go, the louder the silence grows. My intuition flares, colors bursting into hyper-vividness—each emotion has a corresponding spectrum. I step on a flower that blooms only when crushed, its petals unfolding to reveal a map of constellations I'm being drawn toward. A storm of fireflies forms temporary bridges between the floating islands I now see scattered like pearls in an ink-black ocean. The gravity shifts; I glide instead of walk, leaving concentric circles on the air itself. A sealed letter appears in my fist—unopened, it glows with an inner light. As I unfold it, the pages manifest from thin air, ink bleeding through from other dimensions. The text shifts, rewrites itself in conflicting styles and languages yet conveys the same meaning: "The solution isn't what you seek. It's in the way you 'don't solve'—" My pulse feels like it's conducting electricity through veins turned aqueducts. I realize the trembling isn't fear—it's the world unraveling around the edges to make room for something new. A giant clock face emerges from the earth, its hands made of chains that wrap around my ankles but feel featherlight. On each number, a different philosopher's paradox plays out silently. I yawn, and from my mouth emerge dragons made of smoke and constellations. They curl around the clock, whispering solutions that aren't solutions but are. The bridge of paper cranes attempts to speak, their wings fluttering out tales of unsolved riddles that now make sense only to me. The shadows and the light agree to switch places for three seconds, painting the world in negative spaces. I touch a wall that exists to be touched only by thought, and it shifts colors, revealing a corridor that was always there but hidden from expectation. The key in my pocket hums like a tuning fork struck by a lightning bolt. The map within the crushed flower leads me to a well where the bottom isn't water but air perpetually in the act of becoming liquid. Droplets form from nowhere and coalesce into a single, perfect sphere that reflects fractured versions of all the worlds I can almost remember. I throw a coin into the well—but it's made of starstuff, and instead of splash, the well sighs, and the coins melds with my reflection, transforming the image into a question mark that moves with my own features. The well recedes into the ground, leaving behind a staircase of melted glass, each step stained with a different dream I've forgotten. At the top, a door has no handle, no lock, only a single arrow pointing in opposite directions. The instruction manual for a life I haven't lived yet floats beside it, its pages wind-torn and yet pristine. I open it on a random page, and the illustration doesn't depict anything—just an empty frame with a caption: "This is the point where you choose to let go of the answer." The doorframe expands, each plank stretching into beams of colored light, forming a portal that doesn't lead anywhere specific but feels exactly like where you need to go when you've forgotten what 'go' means. My shadow finally stops stretching, joins my form, fingers interlaced with mine, and together we step through. The moment we cross, the colors invert: blues become oranges, golds become muddy earth, and everything else softens into the kind of clarity that feels like stepping out of a trance. But I know this wasn't the end—it was the threshold where everything becomes reversible. The dream stays with me, its edges blurring into the dawn's first light, the only trace being a faint scent of lavender on the air and a clock made of songbirds still ticking faintly in my ear.
