I am dreaming. …draw a single, steady breath, trying to anchor yourself in the quaking dark. The familiar rattle of wheels on rails has died away, replaced by a hush so thick it feels like velvet against your skin. In the pitch-black carriage you can sense—more than see—people shifting, elbows brushing, hearts accelerating in a kind of shared staccato rhythm. Someone coughs. Someone else whispers a prayer. The air smells of overheated brake pads, summer coats, and a faint hint of citrus perfume.

Then, as though the tunnel itself has inhaled, the darkness pulls back a fraction. A ghostly green glow seeps from the seams of the carriage doors. It is not the utilitarian glow of emergency lights; it pulses like the bioluminescence of deep-sea plankton, ebbing and swelling with a heartbeat not quite human. Passengers gasp. You reach out, fingertips grazing the metal pole, and it vibrates with a low hum—an unearthly chord reverberating through bone rather than ear.

You feel the dream shift—like gravity tilting—and suddenly the floor is no longer horizontal. The ceiling yawns open, peeling back like the lid of a can, revealing an impossible sky: indigo speckled with pinpoints of rose-gold stars that spiral outward in slow, hypnotic whirlpools. The subway car is now a capsule drifting through an upside-down cosmos. Somewhere behind you, the panicked murmurs morph into awed silence.

Outside the windows the tunnel walls have dissolved, replaced by colossal stone arches that float freely, as if carved from moonlight. Their surfaces are etched with luminous glyphs—letters from languages no tongue has spoken for millennia. Each symbol flickers to life when you look at it, shedding petals of silver light that tumble away like dandelion seeds on a wind you cannot feel.

A sudden hush, even deeper than before, sweeps the car. One by one, every passenger’s phone screen comes alive, not with notifications or flashlight apps, but with footage of their earliest memory. You glimpse over shoulders: a toddler’s view of a kitchen floor, shoes bigger than mountains; a pair of tiny hands reaching for a red balloon; rippling water reflecting a first swim. The memories shimmer, playing simultaneously in miniature theaters of glass. Someone begins to weep softly, not from fear but from the sheer intimacy of being seen by something—or someone—that can dredge such tender moments from the riverbed of the mind.

As you watch, your own phone, dormant in your pocket, vibrates. You draw it out, and there on the screen is an image of yourself at five, kneeling in a patch of impossibly green grass, palms stained with crushed clover. In the distance of that childhood scene stands a tree you have not recalled in decades: an oak older than stories, its bark tattooed with lightning scars. The image trembles, and then the tree’s silhouette grows until it eclipses the screen, until it spills out of the glass and seems to root itself right inside the subway car, branches lacing through metal grab-rails, leaves unfurling like emerald lanterns.

A warm breeze flows through—the impossible breath of that forgotten meadow. It smells of cut grass and secrets—of afternoons that stretched forever. The panic has drained from the passengers. Eyes widen, hearts steady. The branches rustle and drops of gilded sap fall like coins of sunlight, landing on shoulders, eyelids, tongues. Each drop bestows a sensation: a melody half-remembered, a scent that makes you nostalgic for something that never happened, an emotion too iridescent to name.

You decide to stand. The train—the capsule—doesn’t rock or shudder; it glides through nothingness on silent rails of thought. You notice that the far end of the car has become a doorway bracketed by curtains of rippling dark water, though not a single drop spills onto the floor. Beyond those curtains is a humming-blue corridor that seems to rotate slowly, like a spiral seashell held against the ear of the universe.

Without knowing why, you step into the fluid doorway. Cold silk kisses your cheeks, and suddenly gravity dissolves altogether. You weightlessly somersault through the corridor, passing floating orbs the size of marbles. Each orb contains a miniature scene: cafés full of laughing strangers, mountains breathing mist at dawn, an empty stage waiting for curtains to rise. When you brush a fingertip across one, you hear the corresponding sound—laughter, wind, muffled applause—as if from a great distance. You realize these are possibilities, unsprouted seeds of moments yet to be lived.

Ahead, a single orb brighter than the rest hovers at eye level. Inside swirls the image of the subway car you just left, lights blazing now, passengers cheering, the ancient oak still rooted among them. You sense that touching this orb will return you to that reality—but first you close your eyes and ask, silently: “What comes after panic, after revelation?”

The dream answers. A deep bell tolls, resonating through marrow. The corridor dissolves like salt into water. You find yourself standing once more on solid ground—yet no longer inside a subway car. Instead you are on a platform beneath an open sky, dawn painting the horizon in watermelon and tangerine hues. The train behind you is sleek chrome, doors parted like exhaled breath. No passengers disembark, no conductor waves. You look down: your shoes are dusted with gold leaf, remnants of the oak’s gift.

A newspaper vendor approaches, his cart floating an inch above the platform, tethered by red ribbons. He smiles—eyes the color of twilight—and hands you a single sheet. Headlines shift as you read them, sentences rearranging like schools of fish. Finally they settle into two words: “WAKE GENTLY.” The vendor taps the corner of the page, and the letters bloom into white lilies that drift upward, dissolving into the morning sky.

Somewhere far off, an alarm clock begins its metallic aria. You taste citrus on your tongue—was it perfume? Was it sap? Was it simply the flavor of new beginnings? As the lilies fade, you feel the gravity of waking tug at your limbs, yet you carry with you the hush of the cosmic tunnel, the hymn of bioluminescent glyphs, and the soft resolve that panic can be alchemized into wonder.

You open your eyes in the waking world, yet for a heartbeat longer you swear you can still hear rails humming under your mattress, can still feel the weightless tilt of that dream-born subway gliding across star-strewn silence, delivering you—always—to a horizon where every moment is a door waiting to be opened.
