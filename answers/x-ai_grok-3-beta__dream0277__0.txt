I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me unfurls like a tapestry woven from the threads of the surreal and the impossible. I stand at the edge of a vast, endless chasm, a yawning abyss so deep it seems to swallow light itself. The air is thick with a metallic tang, sharp and cold, stinging my lungs with every breath. Jagged cliffs of obsidian rise on either side, their surfaces gleaming with an unnatural sheen, reflecting distorted versions of myself—each one a fragment of doubt, fear, or unresolved regret staring back with hollow eyes. The ground beneath my feet is not solid; it pulsates faintly, as though I stand on the skin of some ancient, slumbering beast. 

Ahead of me, spanning the chasm, is a bridge made entirely of glass, so thin and fragile it looks as though a single whisper could shatter it into a thousand glittering shards. On the other side lies a shimmering vista—a meadow bathed in golden light, where flowers bloom in colors no human eye should comprehend, and a serene lake mirrors a sky streaked with hues of violet and amber. It calls to me, a siren’s song of peace and resolution, yet the bridge terrifies me. Each step forward feels like a gamble with fate, the glass groaning and cracking under my weight. My heart thunders in my chest, a wild drumbeat echoing in the silence of the abyss. My instinct screams to turn back, to flee from this precarious path, to seek safety—even if it means remaining trapped on this side of the divide forever.

I recognize this pattern of avoidance, this deep-seated urge to shrink away from the trembling uncertainty beneath my feet. I’ve felt it before in waking life—dodging challenges, sidestepping risks, hiding from the sharp edges of growth. But here, in this dream, there is no escaping the confrontation. The chasm seems to widen behind me, the obsidian cliffs crumbling inward as if to force my decision. My discomfort is a living thing, a cold hand gripping my spine, whispering that I am not enough, that I will fall, that I will fail. Yet, as I stand there, paralyzed by the weight of my own fear, something stirs within me—a flicker of defiance, a quiet resolve born from the deepest recesses of my soul.

I take a step forward onto the glass bridge, and the sound of it creaking pierces the silence like a scream. My breath catches, but I don’t stop. Another step, and the bridge holds, though spiderweb cracks bloom beneath my feet, catching the strange, ghostly light of the chasm. My eyes remain fixed on the meadow beyond, its beauty a beacon pulling me onward. The air grows warmer with each step, the metallic tang giving way to the scent of wildflowers and dew-kissed earth. Halfway across, I dare to look down, and the abyss gazes back—a swirling vortex of shadow and starlight, endless and ancient, whispering secrets I cannot yet understand. My knees tremble, my mind begs me to retreat, but I clench my fists and press on, driven by a force I cannot name.

Suddenly, the bridge begins to dissolve beneath me, the glass melting into nothingness. Panic surges, but instead of falling, I feel myself rising. Invisible hands of wind cradle me, lifting me higher, carrying me over the chasm. I am weightless, untethered, a creature of air and light soaring toward the meadow. When my feet touch the soft grass on the other side, a wave of warmth cascades through me, washing away the cold dread that had clung to my bones. The flowers sway as if welcoming me, their petals brushing against my skin like whispers of encouragement. The lake before me ripples, and in its mirrored surface, I see not a fractured reflection, but myself—whole, unburdened, radiant.

I realize then that the discomfort, the fear, the instinct to avoid—it was never the enemy. It was the threshold, the test, the doorway to this place of healing and transformation. Here in the meadow, under a sky that sings with impossible colors, I feel the weight of my avoidance pattern lift like mist under the morning sun. I am not running anymore. I am standing, breathing, becoming. And as the dream begins to fade, the edges of this world softening like a watercolor left in the rain, I carry with me a quiet certainty: I can face what scares me. I can cross the bridge, even if it shatters. I can rise, even if I fall.
