I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

You awaken in a sprawling desert unlike any you have known. The sky above is the color of a bruised plum, heavy with swirling silver clouds that crackle with slivers of lightning. You look down to see your feet half-buried in amber dunes—not merely sand, but shimmering grains with a faint glow, as if each particle traps a tiny spark of starlight. You feel the warmth and subtle hum of energy seeking to surge through you. No sun or moon stands watch in that bizarre sky—only a crooked horizon where the desert stretches on and on. Yet, you cannot tell how time moves in this realm. Seconds feel stretched. Your heart beats in an offset rhythm as your mind tries to adjust to the disorienting pulse of this hidden world.

Turning around, you notice figures in the distance, but they are strangely distorted. They move with unnatural grace, leaving behind glowing trails of color in their wake—pinks, turquoises, and vibrant yellows that linger long after the figures themselves have vanished. You take a few steps forward, steeling yourself with each footstep. Your breath catches when the dunes suddenly shift beneath you, as if the entire desert has decided to sweep you onward, determined to take you deeper into this realm of impossible splendor.

At once, you feel the wind surge, carrying the hush of unknown whispers onto your ears. Words gather and disperse like flocks of shimmering dragonflies. You want to call out, to ask them who they are, what they want—but no single voice in this resonance answers you. Instead, the air crackles, forming a single, luminous portal slashed across the horizon. Through this portal, you glimpse a secret city: delicate crystal spires reaching for the plum skies, waterfalls of multicolored mist, and glowing vines that pulse like veins of light across the walls. There, at the city gates, stands a grand, woven tapestry that seems to breathe. Layers of cloth swirl around a shadowy figure who beckons you closer with a gentle tilt of its head.

You feel a trembling mixture of curiosity and terror. Nothing in the waking world prepared you for this. You cannot decide whether to flee or move closer; everything you’ve ever known is upended, replaced by a sense of thrilling peril. Your heart races, yet something in you yearns to embrace this new reality. So, in the dream’s hush and crackle, you take a slow, deliberate step onto the swirling desert sands—your small act of bravery. At once, the luminous dunes light up in a scintillant pattern under your feet, forming a glowing path toward the city. Every step makes the portal shimmer more radiantly, urging you onward.

Inside, you sense that answers lie just beyond the tapestry, within the unknown corridors of this crystal metropolis. A surge of excitement and wonder surges through your body. You prepare yourself, inhaling the electricity-scented air, every nerve alert, every emotion alive and raging. As you press forward into that swirling gateway, you realize there will be no turning back. You are on the brink of discovery in a land ruled by its own unpredictable magic—a place where routine has been shattered and your expectations no longer apply. All that remains is to follow this strange road, to trust your instincts, and to find out what lies in the heart of this otherworldly dreamscape.
