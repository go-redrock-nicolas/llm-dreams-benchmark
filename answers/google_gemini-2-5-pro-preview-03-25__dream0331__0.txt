I am dreaming. Okay, I am dreaming...

The air itself feels thick, vibrating with a low, resonant hum, like the thrumming of distant, colossal machinery. I'm standing on what seems, initially, like a familiar street corner – the one where we always used to meet after school, beneath the aging oak tree whose roots buckled the sidewalk. But the edges of everything are softened, slightly blurred, as if viewed through antique glass. The familiar brick buildings across the way seem taller, leaning inwards at impossible angles, their windows dark voids that seem to inhale the perpetual twilight filtering down from an unseen source.

There they are... my friends. Not all at once, but appearing like figures stepping momentarily out of a swirling fog that isn't quite visible but definitely *felt*. One moment, Lena is there, her familiar fiery hair now looking subdued, almost ashen under the strange light. She's holding not her usual sketchbook, but a heavy, intricate brass astrolabe, turning its rings with intense concentration, her expression distant, focused on calculations I can't begin to comprehend. She doesn't look up.

Then, I see Sam. He's further down the street, which now seems to stretch unnaturally long, perspective warping like pulled taffy. He’s wearing a uniform I don’t recognize – crisp, grey, functional – and he’s methodically packing identical sterile boxes onto a slow-moving, silent conveyor belt that emerges from one shadowy doorway and disappears into another further down. He moves with a practiced, almost robotic rhythm, his face set in lines of disciplined routine. I try to catch his eye, but it’s like he’s looking straight through me, or perhaps at a point far beyond me.

Suddenly, the ground beneath my feet feels… different. Less solid. I look down and the buckled pavement is subtly shifting, the cracks widening, not violently, but with a slow, geological patience. Between me and Lena, a thin trickle of water appears, dark and oily, winding its way through the expanding fissure. It rapidly widens, becoming a sluggish stream, then a definite channel. The hum in the air intensifies slightly.

I want to call out, to bridge this growing gap. My lips part, I form Lena’s name, but the sound that comes out is like dry leaves skittering across pavement – faint, fragile, instantly whipped away by a non-existent breeze. I try again, louder this time, focusing on Sam, but my voice feels muffled, absorbed by the thick, strange atmosphere. It’s like shouting into dense velvet.

Across the now-noticeable waterway, Lena adjusts her astrolabe, muttering complex coordinates under her breath, her voice clearer to my dreaming ears than my own shouts. She takes a step back, not away from me, but *sideways*, onto a path that hadn't been there a moment before – a path paved with smooth, dark stones that seems to lead directly *upwards*, curving away into the dim sky like a ramp to nowhere.

Further down, Sam finishes loading a box, pats it decisively, and then steps *onto* the conveyor belt himself. It carries him slowly, inexorably, towards the dark doorway at the end of the impossibly long street. He doesn’t look back.

A peculiar sensation begins in my own chest – not panic, but a profound, echoing loneliness. It feels like a physical weight, settling deep within me. I try to reach out, extending my hand across the dark, widening channel of water towards the memory of where Lena stood, but my arm feels heavy, unresponsive. The distance is already too great. The water separating us is now broad enough to be called a river, its surface reflecting the strange, muted light in slow, undulating patterns.

The street corner, once a nexus of shared jokes and future plans whispered under the oak tree (which now looks petrified, its leaves like grey stone), is becoming an isolated shore. I watch Lena's ascending path fade into the twilight haze. I watch the dark doorway swallow Sam and the conveyor belt. The hum deepens, settling into a mournful A-minor chord that resonates in my bones. I am left standing on my side of the quiet, dark river, the familiar ground strangely alien beneath my feet, acutely aware of the vast, silent distances opening up, not just physically, but integrally, irrevocably, in the very fabric of this dream landscape. The divergence is no longer a feeling; it's the geography now. And I am here, while they... are heading elsewhere.
