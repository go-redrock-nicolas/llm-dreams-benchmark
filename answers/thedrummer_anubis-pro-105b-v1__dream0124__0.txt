I am dreaming. I close my eyes and let my imagination run wild. I picture myself standing in a vast, ethereal landscape where time seems to flow backwards. The sky is a swirling vortex of colors - deep purple, shimmering gold, and electric blue hues dance across the horizon as if the very fabric of reality is unraveling before my eyes.

In this strange dimension, I find myself in the midst of a bustling city. But it's not like any city I've ever seen. Buildings appear to crumble and collapse, only to reassemble themselves in a matter of seconds. People walk by, their movements fluid and organic, yet somehow deconstructed. They unfall, untripped, and unstep as if each action had its desired end result first and foremost. 

I look down at my hands and body. I'm a part of this inverted world; I can feel it. My hair grows shorter, cut and styled by some unseen force before I ever felt the vague fear of seeing it there long. My clothes iron and stitch themselves into place, only to appear in a disheveled state seconds before. 

Every thought reaches the tipping point before the sentience forms. Solutions pop into being, prior to problems making themselves present. The effect occurs, and then, inversely, the cause takes place to meet them.

To even move, I find myself at the end point, then traveling to the beginning. I will be at the base of a skyscraper, then I will close my eyes, then I shall hold them open. Surely, I must then grow the muscle under my abandonment. I will fit together, functioning, prior to being born.
