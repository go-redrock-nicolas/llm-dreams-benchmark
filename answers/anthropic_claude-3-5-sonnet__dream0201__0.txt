I am dreaming. The guttering flame of my antique brass lantern sends serpentine shadows dancing across the weathered limestone walls, each flicker making the ancient carved symbols seem to writhe and shift like living things. The air down here is thick with the musty breath of centuries, carrying whispers of forgotten histories and long-buried secrets. My fingers trace the cool, damp stone as I navigate deeper into the labyrinthine passages, feeling the subtle texture of eroded hieroglyphs beneath my fingertips.

*flicker*

The light dims momentarily, and my heart skips a beat. In that brief instant of darkness, the silence seems to deepen, becoming almost tangible. I swear I hear something moving in the blackness ahead – a soft scraping, like silk brushing against stone.

*flicker*

This time, the darkness lasts longer. When the light returns, the shadows have changed somehow. They seem darker, more substantial, as if they're reluctant to retreat from the lantern's glow. The air feels different too – heavier, expectant, like the moment before a thunderstorm breaks.

*flicker... flicker... flicker*

The lantern is failing now, its light growing weaker with each sputter. In the strobing darkness, I begin to lose my sense of direction. The walls seem to shift and move when I can't see them, and I'm no longer certain which passage I came from. The scratching sound is closer now, accompanied by something that might be breathing – or might be the wind finding its way through ancient ventilation shafts.

As the light fades one final time, I feel something brush against my shoulder, soft and deliberate, and a whisper that might be my name echoes from the darkness...

The lantern goes out.
