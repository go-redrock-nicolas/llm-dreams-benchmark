I am dreaming. The air hangs thick and syrupy, carrying the scent of ozone and damp pavement, even though no rain has fallen. I find myself standing on a familiar cobbled street, the one leading to the old library, yet it's bathed in a perpetual, luminous twilight that swallows sounds whole. The sky overhead isn't black or blue, but a deep, bruised violet, starless and imposing. Streetlights, fashioned like giant, skeletal dandelions, flicker erratically, casting shadows that writhe and stretch like living things, independent of the objects that should be casting them.

And there she is – Clara. My dear friend, whose laughter usually sounds like wind chimes, whose presence is normally a grounding force, a warm hearth. But this isn't quite her. She stands near the graffitied wall of the closed bookshop, her posture unnaturally rigid. Her vibrant red coat seems faded, almost grey, under the pulsating violet light. She isn't looking at me, though I feel certain she knows I'm here.

Her attention is utterly captivated by the sheer brick wall. Her head is tilted, listening intently, her expression one of desperate concentration mingled with a unsettling flicker of manic glee. Her hands, usually busy sketching or kneading dough, are cupped near the bricks, darting back and forth as if trying to snatch invisible insects from the air. I realize with a jolt of cold dread – she's trying to *catch echoes*. Not sounds, but the lingering ghosts of sounds, the theoretical reverberations trapped in the space around us.

"Clara?" I call out, but my voice feels thick, muffled, absorbed instantly by the heavy silence. It doesn't seem to reach her, less than twenty feet away. It's like shouting into a pillow.

She ignores me, her movements becoming quicker, more frantic. She presses her ear flat against the cold brick, then pulls back suddenly, clapping her hands together as if she's trapped something infinitesimally small. A tiny, sharp gasp escapes her lips, sounding brittle, like thin ice cracking. She opens her hands slowly, peers into her palms with wide, unblinking eyes that reflect the flickering streetlight in a disturbing, fragmented way, and then lets out a low groan of frustration, presumably finding them empty.

A profound unease creeps up my spine, prickling like frost. This isn't just eccentricity; it feels fundamentally *wrong*. The Clara I know is pragmatic, rooted in reality. This spectral figure, obsessed with capturing the intangible, feels like a stranger wearing her skin. The ground beneath my feet seems to subtly shift, not quite solid, like I'm standing on a raft made of hardened jelly. Shadowy figures, tall and indistinct, seem to linger just at the periphery of my vision, their silent observation adding a layer of pressure, of judgment.

I try again, stepping closer. "Clara, what are you doing? Talk to me." Again, the words die in my throat, swallowed by the oppressive atmosphere. The air itself feels resistant to my attempts at connection.

She turns her head sharply, finally acknowledging me, but her gaze slides past me, unfocused. A smile touches her lips, but it's cold, sharp-edged. "They're slippery," she whispers, her voice raspy, unfamiliar. "The quiet ones are the hardest to hold. They remember everything." She gestures vaguely at the air around her cupped hands.

My heart aches with a mixture of fear and profound sadness. This isn't my friend. Or rather, it *is* my friend, but filtered through some grotesque, distorting lens. The urge to run, to escape this unsettling twilight and the stranger inhabiting Clara's form, wars fiercely with the desperate need to reach her, to pull her back from this precipice of unreality.

The dandelion streetlights flare violently, plunging the street into moments of near-blinding brightness followed by almost total darkness, the flickering rhythm becoming frantic, mirroring the frantic energy emanating from Clara. In one of the bright flashes, I see tiny, iridescent threads shimmering around her fingertips – remnants of the echoes she believes she's catching? The shadows cast by the lights deepen, the peripheral figures seem to lean in closer, expectant.

I have to do something. Shouting is useless. Logic feels utterly alien in this place. My feet feel heavy, rooted uncertainly to the shifting ground, but the imperative to act pulses through me. Ignoring the chilling strangeness, pushing past the fear tightening its coils around my chest, I decide. Words have failed, perhaps a connection needs something more tangible, something grounded in the world we *used* to share.

Slowly, deliberately, I reach into the pocket of my own dream-coat. My fingers close around something small, smooth, and comfortingly solid – a sea-smoothed piece of jade green glass I found on a beach years ago, something real. Holding it out in my palm, a tiny beacon of tangible colour against the violet gloom, I take a hesitant step towards her, towards the friend lost in her pursuit of phantom sounds. My intention is clear, even if unspoken: to offer her an anchor, something solid to hold onto in this sea of shifting shadows and slippery echoes. Will she see it? Will she take it? Or will she, and the unsettling world she occupies, simply dissolve as I reach her? The pulsating light flashes, her hollow eyes meet mine, and the dream holds its breath...
