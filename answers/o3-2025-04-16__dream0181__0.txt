I am dreaming. …step onto a lilac-colored cloud that feels like cool velvet under your bare feet. A trumpet made of molten moonlight announces your name—one you scarcely recognize, as if borrowed from a forgotten myth—and the cloud ferries you upward through constellations as casual as streetlights. A palace materializes ahead: half cathedral, half coral reef, its spires dripping rose-petal rain that smells faintly of cinnamon and old parchment.

Inside waits the Council of Revered Bureaucrats, a motionless ring of porcelain masks hovering above embroidered robes. With a single unanimous nod they appoint you High Arbiter of Everything That Glimmers, handing you a gleaming scepter wound with fireflies and fountain-pen nibs. Qualifications? You stammer that you once balanced a checkbook and occasionally remember your passwords. The masks click together in approval—apparently that suffices.

Immediately you’re escorted to the War Room, which resembles an oversized music box. Bronze gears churn beneath a glass floor; each gear represents a department, and every department is alive: accountants fashioned from abacuses, diplomats who speak only in origami cranes, historians whose beards unravel into scrolls. They pause and scrutinize you with the wary respect usually reserved for thunderstorms.

Your chief subordinate—the veteran General of Practicalities, a stern woman composed entirely of fountain ink—steps forward. “You lack tenure, trials, and titles,” she hisses, her inky form rippling. Around her, murmurs rise like wind through reeds. Resistance is thick enough to taste, a metallic flavor at the back of your throat.

You inhale, and in this dream-air you can literally breathe ideas. A daring thought fills your lungs: leading without pretending. You lift the scepter and it unfurls into a spiral staircase of light. Inviting the skeptical staff onto the first step, you say, “Guide me. Show me the storms you’ve weathered.” The staircase morphs into a living slideshow of their collective memories: late-night ledger battles, treaties forged under lunar eclipses, disasters averted by hair-width margins. Watching their victories flicker in 3-D constellations, you voice what no previous leader bothered to say: “Your expertise is the kingdom’s gravity. I’m here to be its satellite, not its tyrant.”

Something softens. The ink-General liquefies into a fountain that writes YES across the ceiling. Abacus accountants rearrange their beads into smiles. Even the silent porcelain masks drift in, cracking faint crescents where mouths should be.

Together you tackle the first crisis: a rebellion of rogue sunsets refusing to descend, leaving the world locked in perpetual dusk. You assign the historians to negotiate with Time, while the diplomats fold origami cranes into kites to lasso stray sunbeams. You, meanwhile, orchestrate—less conductor than gardener—pruning, listening, guiding. As the sky finally agrees to cool into twilight, the palace windows flash applause in emerald Morse code.

Later, alone on a balcony of floating stained glass, you muse that genuine authority feels less like a crown and more like a tuning fork: vibrating, receptive, setting others humming at their truest pitch. Below, the gears of the palace spin with new confidence, clicking out an anthem that echoes into waking.

And just as the anthem crescendos—daybreak slips a gold coin beneath your eyelids, payment for the dream—and you awaken, heartbeat echoing like distant drums, palms still tingling with the memory of that luminous scepter that smelled of fireflies and fountain ink.
