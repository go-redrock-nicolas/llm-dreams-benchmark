I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Whispering City**  

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rusted metal as you step onto the cobbled streets of a city that should not exist. The buildings stretch upward like the ribs of some ancient beast, their facades carved with unfamiliar constellations—constellations that shift when you blink, as if rearranged by unseen hands. The bricks pulse faintly, breathing in time with your own heartbeat.  

Beneath your feet, the cobbles are not stone but fragments of old letters, their ink still wet, whispering secrets as your steps disturb them. *"Forgotten,"* one murmurs. *"Found,"* replies another. The sky is not sky but a great mirror, reflecting not your face but a thousand possible faces, each expression more uncertain than the last.  

At the center of the city stands a clocktower with no hands. Its face is a spiraling labyrinth, and within its gears, voices hum in dissonant harmony. A masked figure—tall, clad in moth-eaten velvet—extends a hand toward you. When they speak, their voice is the sound of pages turning.  

*"You used to see paths as straight lines,"* they say. *"But now you hear the echoes between them."*  

They open their palm. A key sits there, wrought from shadow and starlight. It melts into your skin before you can take it.  

And then the city sighs, and all at once, the streets rearrange themselves. The once-distant sound of ocean waves rises as walls dissolve into bridges, paths fork into spirals, and suddenly you understand—every choice you’ve ever made was never just one choice.  

You wake just as the first drop of rain falls from the mirrored sky—or was it your own tear? The lingering taste of copper and honey lingers on your tongue, and the whispers follow you into waking.  

*Now you know.*
