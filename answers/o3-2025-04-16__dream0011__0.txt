I am dreaming. …not written in ink at all.

Line after line of the parchment gleams with quick-silver, and as you lean closer the glyphs twist into living shapes—little silver minnows that swim across the page, rearranging themselves into questions that feel as though they were plucked from the very marrow of your being.

QUESTION ONE  
The words ripple into a mirror, and in its surface you see your eight-year-old self standing on a tide-swept pier at sunset. The question hovers in the clouds behind that child:  
“Which dream did you let fall overboard that evening, and what song would coax it back to shore?”  
Your pulse drums in your ears like gull-wings. You taste brine and cotton candy at once. Somewhere a violin made of sea-glass starts to play.

QUESTION TWO  
The silver minnows spill off the page and swim in slow orbits around your head, weaving into a crown of liquid memory. An unseen proctor, shaped entirely from windblown pages, clears its paper-throat. The next question unfurls across its chest:  
“You’ve been given a single match and a library of unspoken truths. Which volume will you ignite so that the others may stand unburned—and what constellation will the smoke sketch against the ceiling of the night?”  
You feel the itch of phantom ash on your fingertips, though the match is only a thought tucked behind your ear.

QUESTION THREE  
A hush settles. The floor beneath your desk stretches into a river of dark velvet, and your chair becomes a gondola; lanterns drift by, each lit by the glow of an emotion you can’t name until it sputters past. The parchment ripples into water, reflecting stanzas of moonlight that arrange themselves into letters:  
“Rewrite the moment you first tasted fear, but trade its bitterness for a flavor no tongue has ever known. Describe that flavor for those who have never dreamed.”  
Your stomach flutters—part hunger, part awe—as if you might actually taste the impossible word you have yet to invent.

BONUS QUESTION  
The exam hall roof unfurls into night sky. Stars rearrange themselves like eager pupils. A comet lingers just above the horizon long enough to carve a final inquiry in flaming cursive:  
“When the universe folds up this dream and tucks it into your waking pocket, what single object will you keep as proof that you were here?”  
The paper comet hisses out, showering the desks with sparks that smell faintly of campfire stories.

You glance around: your classmates are motes of colored smoke, each scribbling answers with quills made from their own feathers, some laughing, some weeping, all utterly certain that every nebula-inked sentence will decide who they are upon waking.

Your pen—no, your pen is actually a stem of lavender dipped in aurora. The test clock is a heartbeat stitched onto the wall, the second hand a pulse of warm crimson light. It speeds up every time you hesitate, slows whenever you breathe.

You exhale.  
Ink blooms across the page like dawn across frost.  
The questions wait, shimmering, alive—  
and you realize the only failing grade possible  
is to answer them without wonder.
