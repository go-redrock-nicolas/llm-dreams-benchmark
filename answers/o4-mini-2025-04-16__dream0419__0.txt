I am dreaming. You find yourself wandering through a moonlit glade where the grass shimmers like spun silver and the air is thick with the scent of night-blooming jasmine. Above you, a constellation of floating lanterns drifts lazily, each one humming a soft, melodic tone as if they carry words unsaid. The deeper you step into this realm, the more alive the colors become—vines that glow emerald, petals that pulse with lavender light, and trees whose bark ripples in ever­shifting patterns of cobalt and pearl.

Suddenly, a chorus of gentle voices rises around you—thin, ringing notes that weave into praise. “You are luminous. You are grace. You have done beautifully.” They echo from every direction, like water spilling over polished stones. At first, your heart flutters with warmth, but soon your chest tightens: you shrink back, shoulders curling inward, as though each syllable lands too close, too bright. The lantern-light flickers in response, as if surprised by your unease.

Pushing forward, you find a narrow path of stepping-stones suspended over a mirrored pool. Each stone bears an inscription of a compliment you once received in waking life: “Brave,” “Kind,” “Creative,” “Steadfast.” You can see your reflection beneath you, fragmented into kaleidoscopic fragments. Every time you place a foot on a stone, the word beneath you glows—and you feel the old sting of discomfort. Your reflection winces, as though it knows your secret: that praise, even sincere, feels like a spotlight too hot to stand under.

Exploring this discomfort with acknowledgment, you pause at the pool’s center. There, a single lantern drifts low, its hue shifting through every color of dawn. You reach out with trembling fingers; the lantern descends until it rests gently in your palm. The humming turns into a single, sustained note that reverberates through your bones. The translucent lantern’s glass walls reveal tiny motes of light dancing inside—each one a memory of acceptance, a small victory you once denied yourself.  

As you cradle it, the lantern warms your hand, and you feel a subtle loosening in your chest. The voices of praise hush into a hush of wind through the trees. In that stillness, you realize: it’s not the praise itself that unsettles you, but the fear that you don’t deserve it. You draw in a breath that tastes of starlight and jasmine’s sweetness, and you whisper back to the glowing lantern: “Thank you.”  

At your whispered acknowledgment, the lantern unfurls its light like a gentle sunrise, casting long, rosy fingers across the glade. The mirrored pool ripples, and your reflection steadies into a single, whole image—calm, open, unafraid to bask in the glow. The vines glow a softer green, the lanterns above sway in quiet applause, and in that moment you understand: praise is not a blaze to fear, but a warm ember to hold. With that understanding, you step off the stones, carrying the lantern’s glow inside you, ready to wake renewed.
