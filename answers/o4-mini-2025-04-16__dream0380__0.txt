I am dreaming. I close my eyes—and suddenly I’m floating in a vast cathedral of mist and moonlight. The floor beneath me is a swirling mosaic of opal clouds, each cloud edged with silver filigree that shimmers with every heartbeat. All around, colossal archways carved from living wood curve upward into a sleeping sky. In their branches, lantern-fruits glow: some burn emerald green, some burn ruby red, and some burn soft lavender. Each lantern holds a voice.

At the center of this cathedral is a great round table hewn from a single emerald slab. Seven glowing chairs hover a hand’s breadth above the floor, each chair made of drifting light—azure, amber, violet, jade, rose, gold, and onyx. Seven figures gather there. The Azure Chair holds a wind-spirit whose voice whistles like a mountain gale; the Amber Chair holds a sun-being whose laughter dazzles like noon; the Rose Chair holds a shy night-breeze barely felt. And across the table, the Onyx Chair sits empty, its occupant silent and unseen.

I realize in this dream that I am the facilitator. A silver chalice appears in my hand, etched with threads of starlight. From its brim drips a gentle lullaby that expands into conversation. “We gather these voices to weave a tapestry of truth,” I say, my voice echoing like rain in a hollow canyon. “But I sense some lanterns burn so brightly we miss the softer glow of others.”

The wind-spirit leans forward, words rushing like gale-force wind. The sun-being laughs and speaks in brilliant bursts of light. Their energy is intoxicating—and I see the lavender lantern fruit on the tree quiver, ready to fall, unheard. I set the chalice gently on the table, and it snaps open like a flower, revealing a tiny hummingbird of light. The bird darts toward the empty Onyx Chair, perching on its back with a tiny chirp that demands attention.

I speak again: “Before we continue, let us pass the chalice of listening. May each voice have a moment to sip from its brim.” The chairs drift—first amber, then azure—offering the chalice in turn. When it reaches the Onyx Chair, nothing stirs. I breathe in the hush, and in that silence I hear a single, quivering note—like a cocoon unwrapping. A slender figure materializes: dressed in dusk-blue robes, eyes bright as starlit pools. Hesitant at first, they lift the chalice, their lips trembling. Then they speak—a gentle story about a lost constellation, about a longing for belonging, about wisdom found in quiet corners.

As their voice unfurls, petals of soft lavender drift from the lantern-tree, turning the mist rosy. The wind-spirit eases its gusts to a whisper, the sun-being dims its glare to a warm glow. I guide us: “Thank you for sharing that luminous truth. What resonance do others feel? What questions arise?” The conversation shifts—each voice now weaving around that first gentle thread. The chalice passes in new directions: rose to jade, gold to violet. Each drink from its light brings out a new note—of hope, of challenge, of compassion.

By the time dawn faintly colors the mist in pale blush, we have formed a living tapestry: each lantern-fruit’s light mingled—bright and soft, thunderous and tender. The Onyx Chair no longer stands empty but glows in harmony with the rest. As the dream brightens toward wakening, I feel a soft triumph—that in this cathedral of clouds, every voice found its moment to shine. And as I open my eyes, I carry with me the echo of that hummingbird’s chirp: a promise to keep the chalice of listening always passed with care.
