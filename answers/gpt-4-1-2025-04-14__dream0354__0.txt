I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, shifting labyrinth—a maze of winding corridors formed from pale, translucent glass. Each wall shimmers with ghostly scenes from my past: laughter in sunlit fields, words hissed in stormy kitchens, the hollow ache of goodbyes. The air tastes like secrets and longing.

I see a thread of golden light at my feet, trailing away into a midnight corridor. Compelled by a mixture of hope and desperation, I follow it, the echo of my footsteps ringing with an uncanny resonance. With every step, familiar patterns surface—faces blurring from warmth to coldness, hands reaching out only to withdraw, the bittersweet dance of closeness and pushing away. It’s as if the glass walls are mirrors, reflecting each moment where love slipped between my fingers despite my silent vows to hold on differently this time.

I reach a circular chamber at the heart of the maze. Here, the air is thick with a living silence. In the chamber stands an apparition: myself, eyes downcast, wrapped in a mantle of mist. My double is surrounded by looping, shadowy ribbons—each representing a promise broken, a hope deferred. When I speak, my words ripple across the chamber, distorting the ribbons.

With trembling hands, I approach myself and ask: *Why do we return here? What secret are you still guarding, even from me?*

The apparition looks up, eyes glimmering with an ancient sorrow and something more—understanding. "Because," she whispers, "this cycle is an old language. It speaks of wounds hoping for tenderness, of fears learning to trust. It is not punishment, but a signpost."

I realize that I have been circling the same wounds, not to suffer, but to finally see them with eyes unclouded by shame. There, in the luminous stillness, I embrace my shadowed twin. The glass labyrinth begins to dissolve, replaced by a field blooming with strange, wild flowers—each petal a symbol of broken patterns turning into healing.

In that vivid dream-light, resolve blossoms: I will carry this vision into waking life. With compassion’s steady hand, I will walk onward, free to write a new language of love—one built not on the repeating echoes of the past, but on the luminous possibilities of change.
