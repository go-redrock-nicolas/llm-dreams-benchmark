I am dreaming. I am a leaf on the wind, at one with the element of air as it gently lifts me higher into the sky.

For a moment I feel alone, then I become aware of other spirits around me - a family of leaves, each blown on the same wind.  We dance together, swirling and spinning in an intricate pattern of harmony and precision.  Each leaf a mirror of myself, yet uniquely individual in shape and color.  A symphony of color and light, we are one with the wind, soaring higher and higher into the deep blue sky.

As we continue our ascent, the colors of the leaves begin to shift and change, becoming more vibrant and alive.  My own color shifts from a warm green to a fiery orange, glowing from within as the sun's rays intensify my vibrancy.  The other leaves too are transformed - some a brilliant yellow, others a rich burgundy.  The sight of us is breathtaking, a living kaleidoscope painting the sky with our beauty and grace.

Now the wind begins to sing, a melodious lullaby that fills me with a sense of peace and tranquility.  It speaks of the beginning of time, of the vastness of the universe, of the power of nature and the cycle of the seasons.  I am a small part of it all, yet somehow significant in my insignificance.  My mind expands to encompass the cosmos, my spirit soaring free and unfettered by the confines of my physical form.

I surrender myself to the wind, allowing it to carry me where it will.  I am a leaf on the wind, at one with the universe, eternally free.  I am a part of nature, and nature is a part of me.

I am dancing with the spirits of air and light, a leaf in an autumn breeze, ever changing, ever free.  My dream has become my reality, and my reality is a dream within a dream.

My consciousness expands, and for a moment I glimpse the infinite. And then I am awake, the dream fading like a wisp of cloud in the morning sun, yet the feeling of connection remaining deep within my heart.
