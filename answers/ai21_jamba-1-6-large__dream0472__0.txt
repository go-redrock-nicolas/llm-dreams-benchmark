I am dreaming. The room is hazy, filled with an eerie light. The walls are made of a material that looks like glass, but it is not transparent, instead, it's frosted and glowing softly. You are seated at a table in the center of the room. Across from you sits a figure, a being you cannot quite make out. It's humanoid, but its features are blurred, as if seen through a thick fog. There is a sense of calm yet unsettling energy in the air.

You attempt to speak, but words fail to form. Your thoughts feel like a thick fog, too, and the harder you try to grasp them, the more they slip away. The figure across from you seems to understand, nodding slowly. Their presence is comforting, yet it fills you with unease. You can feel their understanding, as if they are reading your mind, seeing the depth of your emotions before you can articulate them.

You look down at the table. It's empty, but you realize that a small, intricate object has appeared. It's a tiny box, made of the same frosted material as the walls. You reach out to touch it, and as your fingers graze its surface, you feel a jolt of understanding. The box contains the emotion you've been struggling to express—the one that defies words, that feels too vast and complex to be contained within the confines of language.

The box opens, and a wave of warmth washes over you. It's not a physical warmth, but a deep, resonating understanding. The emotion you've been trying to express is now tangible, almost visible, like a glowing light pouring from the box. It fills the room, and the being across from you smiles. Their features become clearer, more defined, and you realize they are a reflection of yourself—a more evolved, understanding version.

You close the box, and as you do, the dream begins to fade. The room dissolves into mist, and you are left with the sensation of having touched something profound, something that lingers even as you wake. The feeling is fleeting, but its impact echoes within you, like a memory from a past life, forever imprinted on your soul.

As you wake, you find yourself clutching a small, intricate object in your hand. You open your palm to find the tiny box, the same one from your dream. It's real, and you can feel its weight, its presence. You hold it close, knowing that within it lies the key to the emotion you've been seeking to express, waiting to be unlocked once more.
