I am dreaming. You find yourself standing on a shore made of moon-silver sand. Each grain glimmers like a fleck of starlight, and when you wiggle your toes it rings softly, as if tiny bells are hidden beneath the surface. A lavender-blue ocean breathes in slow pulses, exhaling bioluminescent foam that sketches constellations at your feet. The air hums with an almost musical hush—peaceful, yet it stirs that old unease inside you, the low-key dread that good things never last.

A kite appears in your hand, fashioned from translucent silk that shimmers with shifting patterns—sometimes a swirling nebula, sometimes a map of places you’ve never visited. Instinct says the wind is perfect, so you launch the kite into the violet sky. It climbs higher, higher, and with every beat of its tail the horizon brightens. But your chest tightens; you expect the line to snap, for the wind to die, for the dream to sour. 

The sky answers. A gentle thunder of wings draws your eyes upward: an enormous sea turtle drifts overhead as if swimming through air, its shell inlaid with glowing runes. It casts a warm emerald shadow that settles over you like a leafy canopy. Your heartbeat steadies. In that calming shade, the anxious voice inside you softens—not silenced, but appeased. The turtle blinks, slow and deliberate, as if teaching you the rhythm of steady trust: inhale, exhale, repeat.

Then, from the folds of cloud, lantern-fish float down—bulbous lights bobbing around their smiling faces. They circle the kite string, weaving it with strands of liquid gold until it becomes unbreakable. You feel the tension in your grip dissolve; you realize nothing is about to snap. Instead, the string is now a staircase of luminescent rope.

Curiosity nudges aside apprehension. You climb. Each step is buoyant, a trampoline of warm breeze. As you ascend, you pass through drifting curtains of petal-thick mist, peach-scented and cool on your skin. By the time you reach the level where clouds billow like whipped cream, the nagging expectation of ruin has faded to a single shy ember.

Ahead lies a floating orchard: trees with crystal trunks, branches drooping with spheres of color—sunset-orange, sunrise-pink, galaxy-purple. You pluck a fruit. It feels like velvet ice, yet the instant it touches your lips it melts into liquid summer: mango, honey, mint. The taste triggers a memory of every small victory you’ve ever enjoyed—those unheard cheers when things actually went right. You savor it deliberately, refusing to rush.

A murmuring brook cuts through the orchard, its water liquid mirror. As you kneel beside it, your reflection looks back with eyes bright as comets—steadier, kinder. The surface ripples, and words appear in scrolling silver: “Good moments aren’t traps. They’re invitations.”

You dip a hand into the brook; the water turns into glittering ribbons that wrap around your arm, forming a bracer etched with affirmations—“Trust celebrates, not waits.” Warmth spreads up your veins, rewriting the old script. You feel the strange pleasure of believing, genuinely believing, that not every calm hides a storm.

In the orchard’s heart stands a pavilion woven of dawn-colored silk. Inside, musicians shaped from candle-flame play instruments made of windchimes and rain. They notice you and shift their melody. What begins as a tentative lullaby swells into resilient fanfare—notes designed to reinforce trust. With each chord your anxiety unwinds like a knotted thread finally released. You breathe, and the very air thickens with gratitude.

At last the pavilion doors glide open, revealing a staircase hewn from prismatic glass. It descends back to the moon-silver beach. You know the lower world—and waking life—awaits, but there’s no dread this time, only anticipation. You pocket a single crystal seed from the orchard; it thrums like a tiny heartbeat, promising to bloom whenever you need its reminder.

You step onto the staircase. It sings beneath your feet: a promise, not a warning. For the first time you notice how weightless you are—not because the world is fragile, but because you trust its beauty to hold. The seed warms in your palm, and you smile wide enough to swallow the doubt.

You awaken. The sound of the silver sand ringing still echoes faintly in your chest, and the seed—though invisible—rests against your heart, pulsing a steady beat whenever things begin to go too well. It whispers: Let them.
