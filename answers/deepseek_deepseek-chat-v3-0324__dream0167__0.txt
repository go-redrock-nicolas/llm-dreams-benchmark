I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of smoldering incense and old parchment, the weight of centuries pressing down on the gilded hall where the war council gathers. The leaders of the two factions—the Dawnborn, clad in flowing silver robes that shimmer like morning mist, and the Duskforged, armored in blackened steel etched with constellations—glare at each other across a table carved from the petrified roots of the World Tree. My voice, steady but edged with urgency, offers a compromise: shared sovereignty over the sacred valley, a truce woven from mutual reverence for the land.  

They laugh.  

The Dawnborn archon’s laughter is like wind chimes, cold and sharp. *"You would have us break bread with those who drowned our holy city in shadow?"* The Duskforged warlord’s chuckle is the grind of tectonic plates. *"And you expect us to forget the pyres they lit with our children’s futures?"*  

The room darkens. The tapestries writhe, their embroidered battles bleeding fresh crimson. Then—  

A whisper. Not from the factions, not from me, but from the table itself. The wood groans, splinters forming a mouth. *"They will never agree. But you… you could make them remember."*  

The floor dissolves. I’m falling through layers of time, past sieges and coronations, past the first spiteful glance that sparked the feud, until I land in a sun-drenched grove where two figures—not yet Dawnborn or Duskforged, just two lovers—press their foreheads together, weaving a promise into a shared melody. The vision sears me. This is the wound. This is what was lost.  

I wake back at the table, but now my hands glow with the echo of that song. I don’t speak. I hum.  

The archon’s silver tears etch lines down her cheeks. The warlord’s grip cracks his gauntlet. For the first time in centuries, the factions are silent.  

The dream isn’t over. But now, neither are we.
