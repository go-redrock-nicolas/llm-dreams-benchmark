I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I find myself standing in a vast, sterile hospital corridor. The air is thick with the faint tang of antiseptic and the oppressive silence of unspoken dread. Rows of doors stretch endlessly before me, each leading to a room where a life teeters on the edge of existence. The walls pulse with an eerie, soft glow, as though the building itself is alive, aware of the weight of my responsibility.

I am tasked with a harrowing duty: to allocate limited medical treatment among thousands of patients, each with an equal and desperate claim for urgency. Every decision I make will determine who lives and who... doesn't. The burden of these life-and-death choices presses down on me like an invisible, crushing force. I can smell the faint scent of impending loss, a mixture of sweat, fear, and sterile linen that clings to the air.

As I walk slowly down the corridor, the doors whisper open at my approach. Inside each room, I am greeted by a tableau frozen in time. In one, a child lies in bed, surrounded by a family that clings to hope with trembling hands. Their eyes, wide and pleading, follow me as I pass. In another, an elderly man sits alone, his frail frame barely rising with each shallow breath. He stares at me with an unsettling calm, as though he has already accepted his fate.

The murmur of voices fills my ears, but it's not the sound of the living. No, this is the voice of the hospital itself, whispering to me, urging me to choose. "Who deserves to live?" it hisses. "Who can you save?"

I try to focus, to think logically, but the sheer magnitude of the task overwhelms me. My mind races with calculations of survival rates, potential years of life saved, and the ethical weight of each decision. I feel the presence of the other doctors and nurses, their own faces masks of exhaustion and resignation, as they watch me, waiting for guidance.

And then, the dream shifts. I am no longer in the corridor but floating above it, looking down at the endless rows of doors. They stretch into the distance, fading into the infinite. The glowing walls pulse faster now, their rhythm uneven, like a heart struggling to keep beating.

I realize, with a jolt, that the patients are disappearing. One by one, the doors slam shut, their muffled cries silenced. I can feel the hospital's energy wane, its pulse slowing. The air becomes colder, the silence deeper. I am powerless to stop it.

The dream dissolves into a haze of confusion and guilt as I awaken, gasping for breath, the weight of those unmade decisions still pressing down on my chest. The memory of their faces, the sound of their voices, lingers like a shadow long after I wake.
