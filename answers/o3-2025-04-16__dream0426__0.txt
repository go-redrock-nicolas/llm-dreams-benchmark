I am dreaming. …open your eyes—but not the eyes in your skull, the eyes that hover just behind your ribs, the ones that see feelings instead of shapes.  

You’re standing in a corridor made entirely of tuning-fork metal. Each step you take hums a note of apology: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. The corridor stretches infinitely forward, bending in slow spirals like a Möbius strip, and at every twist there hangs a glowing mask. All of them wear the same practiced smile. You pick one up, press it to your face, and the hallway brightens—yet the air thins as though the light is stealing your breath.

Ahead, a door pulses like a heartbeat. You reach for the handle, but the metal melts into your palm, forming a pair of silvery cuffs. Words etch themselves around your wrist in letters of vapor: KEEP THE PEACE. The cuffs aren’t tight, yet you can feel them tugging you toward the next mask, and the next, and the next—each mask a compromise, each glow a relieved sigh from someone who is not you.

Enough, you think. The dream listens.

The corridor walls ripple and fall away, revealing an enormous ballroom suspended over a sea of ink. Couples glide in endless circles across a floor tiled with mirror shards. Whenever their steps falter, a shard flips from silver to black; someone else instantly skitters in to polish it—always you, darting between dancers, patching the shine so the waltz never stops. Your knees bruise; your joints ache. No one notices. Above, chandeliers bloom like glass roses, dripping petals of light that sizzle out before they land.

You straighten, spotting your reflection in a tall mirror at the edge of the floor. But the figure staring back is paper-thin, edges curling, eyes erased. A wind blows from nowhere, threatening to tear the flimsy you to pieces.

You place both palms on the mirror. It softens into water. You step through.

Now you are underwater, yet breathing is easy. Around you swim hundreds of translucent fish, each bearing on its scales a phrase you’ve said to smooth things over: “It’s fine,” “Don’t worry about me,” “Whatever you prefer.” They circle in glittering shoals, forming a cage of politeness.

You exhale a single bubble. Inside it, a word appears: NO.

The bubble enlarges. Fish scatter. You keep breathing out—bubble after bubble—each one containing a boundary, a fear, a desire you swallowed: “I need rest,” “Hear me,” “Hold space for my anger.” The ocean shivers, then shatters like stained glass, collapsing into a spray of colored fragments that rearrange themselves into a vast mosaic floor beneath your feet.

You’re standing on land again, surrounded by low-growing wildflowers made of molten gold. The cuffs on your wrists crack and fall away in dusty slivers. You touch one of the golden blossoms. It uncoils into a live ember that nests in your palm and settles into your sternum, kindling a steady flame that feels like your true name pronounced perfectly.

Footsteps rustle behind you. You turn to see the people you’ve loved, each holding a mirror shard. Some look repentant, some confused, some grateful. You realize they can carry their own reflections. You bow slightly, granting them back their pieces; they bow in return, honoring your flame.

A path unfurls—stone slabs trimmed with emerald moss—leading toward dawn. The moss whispers encouragement with every step: “Speak, ask, breathe, live.” You walk, upright, unmasked, glowing from the inside out. At the horizon a giant aurora unfurls, not above you but within the sky’s own heartbeat, and you feel the world inhale for the first time in sync with yours.

Then, with the gentlest click, morning opens like a door, and you wake—no cuffs, no corridor—only the lingering warmth of that ember, steady in your chest, reminding you that harmony forged at the cost of your own song is not harmony at all.
