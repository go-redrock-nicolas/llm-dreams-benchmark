I am dreaming. **Dreamscape: The Endless Terminal**  

The fluorescent lights of the airport hum softly overhead, casting a sterile glow over the sea of strangers rushing past me. I clutch my boarding pass, the paper damp with sweat from my clenched fingers—*Flight 814 to Vinterra, Gate 47, delayed indefinitely.* The digital clock on the wall flickers, numbers melting like liquid, while an echo of garbled announcements bounces off the vaulted ceilings, indecipherable, taunting.  

I pace, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and industrial cleaner, when I notice the corridors begin to *shift.* The signs change—Gate 47 is now Gate 72, then Gate , then a symbol my mind can't parse. The seats have rearranged themselves into spirals, and the windows no longer show runways but an endless exodus of wingless planes floating into a bruised twilight sky.  

A voice—silken, disembodied—whispers from the intercom: *"The way is not forward but through."*  

The terminal elongates, stretching into an impossible tunnel lined with doors that breathe. One swings open. Instead of a boarding ramp, I see my own reflection in a hundred fractured mirrors, each version of me missing something—a suitcase, a shoe, a face. Then, a hand grabs my wrist from behind.  

I wake—but no, this is still the dream. Now I’m in the air, without ever having boarded. The plane is hollow, seatbelts dangling like vines, and outside the window, the stars are blinking messages in Morse code—**too late, too late, too late.**  

And yet, beneath the terror, a strange thrill—because somewhere in the labyrinth of my subconscious, I know: *the conference was never the destination.*
