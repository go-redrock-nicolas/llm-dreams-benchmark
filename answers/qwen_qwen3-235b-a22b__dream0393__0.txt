I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the threshold of my old life.  The ground beneath my feet is familiar, safe; the world beyond is shrouded in a swirling mist of possibilities.  This point marks a divergence, where the easy and comfortable path continues gently forward and a rougher, steeper road winds its way into the unknown and uncertain.  A choice must be made.

Dreaming... the air around me is thick with anticipation.

Across from me, suspended in the shimmering ether of this surreal landscape, are two grand archways. One—smooth, polished, familiar to the point of weariness—leads back to the life I've always known. Safe routines. Predictable cycles of joy and sorrow. No surprises. No fear.  Yet, a strange sorrow lingers in its shadow, an aching sameness that whispers that life will go on but never forward.

The other archway is wild. Not *threatening*, but untamed. It's filled with raw energy—colors braiding into a kaleidoscope of movement. The terrain beyond is lined with shadows and light that shift as if breathing, each step forward promising mystery and danger, growth and loss intertwined. From this unknown path drifts the scent of possibility: adventure, pain, triumph, and metamorphosis.

I feel the weight of the decision—*terrifying*, yet thrilling. The longing for safety tugs at me like a thread pulled tight, eager to draw me back. But something deeper stirs in my chest—a wild, ancient heartbeat. It's the same pulse I've felt while reading poetry beneath moonlight and chasing storms with reckless abandon. It's the unspoken part of me that hungers not just for *more*, but for *truth*. My soul wants to be shaken.

"Why do you hesitate?" I hear, not in words, but through a melody that vibrates in my bones. I cannot tell if the voice is male or female—its origin is as unknowable as the future I am deciding between.

"You already *are* both who you are and who you can become. Walk forward."

I close my eyes and feel the space between my choice—an eternity hinged upon a heartbeat. Then I inhale deeply, my lungs flooding with liquid starlight and the taste of forgotten constellations.

I open my eyes.

With trembling but resolute steps, I step through the wild archway—into the unknown.  The air changes instantly, thick with thick, luminous fog, warm and heavy like a summer storm.  Below, the ground shifts with every step, shaped by memory and possibility.  The world comes alive—trees whisper riddles in ancient tongues, creatures glance up at me with knowing eyes, and the sky opens to reveal a vortex of color and light that seems to be watching *me.*

And still, I walk.

Each footfall is an echo—of courage and curiosity; of fear unmet by retreat.  This new world, while unknowable, feels connected—each branch, each cloud, each heartbeat aware of mine. Life expands before me like a canvas and I, a brush dipped in longing.

I feel small, yet powerful.  Lost, yet found.

The challenge awaiting me is not in the destination, but in embracing the journey—the reckoning of who I've always been and who I *could* be.

I have made my choice.

I choose the wild unknown. I choose growth. I choose the dream... and perhaps, the dream now chooses me.
