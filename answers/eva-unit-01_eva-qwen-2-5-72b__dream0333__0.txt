I am dreaming. I find myself transported to a lush, green forest, where the sun's rays break through the dense canopy, dappling the moss-covered ground. As I explore my surroundings, the chirping of birds and the gentle rustling of leaves accompany my footsteps. The air is crisp and invigorating, carrying the scent of pine and wildflowers.

Suddenly, I hear rapid footsteps approaching. A woman emerges from behind a towering oak tree, her eyes filled with panic. She clutches a crumpled piece of paper in her hand, her face etched with worry. As she draws closer, I catch a glimpse of the paper—it appears to be a hastily scrawled map.

Without hesitation, she turns and begins running deeper into the forest, following the path indicated on the map. A sense of unease washes over me as I instinctively realize she's heading towards danger.

My heart pounds as I quickly close the distance between us, calling out, "Wait! Stop!" She turns, startled, her expression shifting to confusion when she sees me.

The map she holds is incomplete—I can see where the path should continue, but it's torn off. If she continues, she'll stumble unknowingly into a ravine hidden beyond the treeline.

She considers my warning, but her fear overtakes her judgment. She shakes her head and resumes her frenzied pace, disappearing into the dense foliage. Fear propels me forward as I race after her, my voice echoing through the trees. Although I strain my legs, the distance only grows. Dread fills me as I realize I might not reach her in time, and I silently pray she'll stop before it's too late.

I am dreaming.
