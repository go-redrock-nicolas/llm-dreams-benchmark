I am dreaming. As my eyes open wide in intuition, a most miraculous and deeply vivid dreamscape floods into my senses, enveloping my subconscious in a rapturous symphony of color, texture and motion.  

Enamored, I stand on an island- a teeming oasis of verdant green that seems tiny in the vast, sapphire ocean that caresses her shores.  The sand beneath my feet is made of a billion glittering gemstones, all hues of the rainbow, lustrous and gleaming under the brilliant light of a warm sun.  All around me are exotic plants brimming with life, with twisting roots that plunge into the nurturing earth and unfurling leaves that dance in the sweet-scented breeze.  

As I explore further, I encounter thick, luxuriant vines that hang from the trees, reaching for the ground like the tentacles of some treasure-hoarding kraken.  Sensing a challenge, I begin to climb these vines, the rough, hairy bark scratching at my hands, injecting me with a vibrant, tangible strength.  Hand over hand, I ascend, muscles burning, up towards the upper reaches of the canopy.  

Reaching the top, I step onto a branch and gaze in amazement at the view before me.  The wind tousles my hair as I behold a grand waterfall, burbling over the edge of an ocean cliff, plunging into a crystalline pool below.   The sunlight hits the droplets, creating a spectral prism, a thousand shades of refraction casting their luminous beacon out, out into the world.

But most glorious of all are the birds.  Birds in radiant shades of gold, crimson, azure and emerald zip and glide all around, their plumage a cascading kaleidoscope of color.  One in particular, a fierce bird of prey adorned with black ebony and cobalt-blue, alights on my outstretched arm, its talons sharp, biting into my wrist.  But I welcome the pain, for this is strength, distilled to its purest form.  Feeling an insurmountable confidence, I step onto the back of this noble creature, the island rapidly growing smaller as we climb into the sky.

For it's in the strength of my body, the fire of my will that greatness lies waiting.  It may be harnessed through adversity, through the sharp, gnashing teeth of challenge that snap at our heels, clamoring for us to fail.  But I will not fail, for I am strong, I am mighty in the face of what seeks to best me.  

End of dream.
