I am dreaming. The world around me is a kaleidoscope of colors, swirling and shifting like a living painting. The sky is an eerie shade of violet, streaked with bands of shimmering gold and crimson, as if the very heavens are ablaze. The air is thick with an electric charge, the hairs on my arms standing on end, and the scent of ozone fills my nostrils.

Suddenly, my heart begins to pound like a drum in my chest, and a cold sweat breaks out on my forehead. I can feel it, a sense of impending doom, like the calm before a storm. The world seems to slow down, and I notice things that others haven't recognized yet. The trees in the distance, their leaves trembling in a wind that isn't blowing. The birds, silent and motionless, perched on the rooftops, their eyes wide and unblinking. The people, their faces etched with confusion and fear, but they haven't realized what's about to happen.

I see it first in the distance, a dark shape on the horizon, growing larger and more menacing by the second. It's a towering figure, its form shifting and changing, like a shadow given life. It's a monster, a beast of nightmares, and it's heading straight for us. The ground trembles beneath my feet, and the air grows colder, heavier. I can feel the panic rising in my chest, but I know I have to act, to warn the others.

I scream, my voice echoing through the streets, but it's too late. The beast is upon us, its roar shaking the very foundations of the city. I can see the terror in the eyes of those around me, but I can't save them. I can't save anyone. I am alone, a tiny speck in the face of this monstrous force.

And then, as suddenly as it appeared, the beast is gone, and the world is silent. The sky is clear, the air is still, and the people are gone. I am standing in the middle of a desolate wasteland, the ruins of what was once a bustling city stretching out before me. The dream fades, and I am left with the echo of that scream, the memory of that terror, and the knowledge that I was the only one who saw it coming.
