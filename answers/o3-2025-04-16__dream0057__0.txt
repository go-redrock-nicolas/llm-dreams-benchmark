I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

At first there is only wind—warm, cinnamon–scented, curling around you in unseen ribbons—then the scene ripens into focus. You stand on a colossal glass disk suspended high above a sea of lavender clouds. Lightning flickers deep within the vaporous swells, illuminating the disk from below so that the floor continually glows and darkens like the steady pulse of some cosmic heart.

Opposite you, two leaders advance.

To your left strides Varda of the Sunforged Engineers: copper-skinned, ash-blonde braids crowned by a circlet of molten bronze that drips sparks instead of jewels. Her cloak is a banner of sunrise—rose, gold, and tangerine—its edges smoldering like the lip of a solar flare. Gears and lenses clink at her belt, and every footfall leaves a rapid bloom of saffron marigolds on the glass before fading back into nothingness.

To your right glides Kael of the Moonweavers: skin painted with night-blue glyphs that shimmer like constellations, hair trailing behind him in weightless silver threads. His robe billows with slow, underwater grace, and where his sandaled feet touch the disk, frost blossoms in perfect hexagons, glinting white under shifting starlight that no sky above the clouds seems to own.

Both extend a hand toward you.

“Walk in daylight with me,” Varda says, voice vibrating like struck brass. “The Skybridge must burn hot with invention, or it will collapse under its own ambition.”

“Step into the hush of midnight,” Kael whispers, tones cool as crushed velvet. “Only the tempered discipline of shadow can keep the Skybridge from tearing space itself.”

They speak of the same project: a crystalline conduit meant to span the world, allowing ideas, power, and empathy to flow like liquid aurora between nations that have never known peace. Yet their feud—solar fire versus lunar frost—has stalled every calculation, every rivet.

Above you, planetary rings drift like haloed highways; below, the clouds roil with anticipatory thunder. With both leaders awaiting your allegiance, your heart beats a question onto the glass disk: must light and dark war, or can they braid?

You inhale, and the dream air tastes of citrus and cold mint—new sunrise edging into deepest night. Instead of answering either leader, you kneel and place your palms flat on the glass. Immediately filaments of gold erupt from your left hand while filaments of cobalt surge from your right. They weave together, threading into a helix that spirals upward until it becomes a towering column of twilight, the exact hue where day surrenders to evening.

Varda squints, compelled yet cautious. Kael’s eyes widen, reflecting twin eclipses.

The column unfurls like a banner and dissolves into luminous motes that settle on both leaders’ shoulders. Where a spark lands on Varda’s cloak, it cools to a shimmering peach. Where one lands on Kael’s robe, it warms to indigo-tinged coral. Their garments change gradients until neither can tell where sunrise ends or moonrise begins.

A hush falls. The glass disk gives a contented hum—its pulse no longer jerky but steady, like breath.

You rise. Between your feet the marigold petals and frost hexagons now fuse into crystalline blossoms, each petal half-sun, half-moon, quivering with potential energy. Varda and Kael exchange stunned glances; rivalry fractures under the silent revelation: the Skybridge can only be born from a shared spectrum neither had previously considered.

Around the trio of you, the lavender clouds crack open, revealing an immense schematic traced in lightning across the heavens—an architect’s signature drawn by the dream itself. The blueprint shows gears forged of moonstone, beams hammered from dawn’s first light, and at the center an iris that blinks once, acknowledging your choice.

Varda bows, embers falling from her hair like fireflies. Kael mirrors her, frost dusting the hem of his robe like fallen stars. When they rise, their eyes hold the same reflection: your swirling twilight helix.

“We begin at the hush between heartbeats,” they say in a single, harmonized voice.

You step forward into that hush—and wake soaked in the perfume of marigolds, your fingers tingling alternately hot and cold, as though you still straddle the seam where sun and moon, rivalry and alliance, melt into a single dawn.
