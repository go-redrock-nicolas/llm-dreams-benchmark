I am dreaming. In dreams, I find myself in a realm where the laws of reality bend and twist like taffy. The sky above shimmers with iridescent hues, and the air pulsates with a symphony of surreal melodies. Each breath I take fills my lungs with the scent of a million forgotten memories.

Suddenly, I realize I'm in a bustling market square, yet unlike any I've seen before. The stalls are arrayed haphazardly, their patrons and wares all ancient and timeless, in deathly silence,  save for an occasional gusting wind that rustles rotted furs and blows dust across the ground.

In the marketplace, I notice others deferring to my judgment in situations where I feel uncertain, mye.

They approach me, eyes downcast, seeking guidance and wisdom that I know are not mine to give. I am a young man in the marketplace, yet I am an adult. These strangers, these supplicants, they pay homage to my presence as if I am an authority figure, someone with wisdom and experience.

I feel a chill run down my spine as I confront this unexpected authority thrust upon me. Who are these people? Why do they believe I have all the answers?

As I gaze upon the crowd, their faces begin to swirl and shift, morphing into a kaleidoscope of haunting familiarity. I see glimpses of my own family, my friends, my loves from the conscious world. They ventriloquize me, speak, use the words and emotions in the marketplace to tell tales, to express worry and concern.

What do they want from me? I am just as lost and confused as they are. In this surreal dream world, I am the leader, the one everyone expects to guide them through the fog of uncertainty.

As rapidly as the recognition materializes, it loses shape and vanishes, leaving me standing alone amidst the tenebrous market. The faces of my loved ones are replaced by canvas-covered masks, their eyes blank and empty.

I feel a growing sense of unease, a knot of anxiety twisting in my gut. This is not a dream I want to be in. I do not want this responsibility, this burden of leadership.

 But even as I think to escape, a chilling wind blows through the market square, and a deep, echoing voice resonates within me, saying:

"Welcome your power, dreamer. Embrace your destiny."

The voice is inside and outside me, and I see myself in two ways - my physical form and my soul, my shadow. As the voice fades into silence, I am left aloneâ€¦and I watch the dream self move.

With an ethereal grace, I move towards the heart of the market, my dream self gliding forward as if on unseen rails. 

And I follow.

Now I'm in the arena, a battle-ground. Strange beasts made of liquid light stalk towards me, their eyes burning with an otherworldly hunger. I raise my hands, and fire erupts from my fingertips, searing through the air and striking the creatures dead.

They fall, their bodies disintegrating into a million sparkling motes. As they crumble, I realize that these creatures were not my enemies, but rather, they always were just me.

A barrier rises up.  After breaching it, I emerge into a vast expanse of shimmering white. Before me, a figure stands, cloaked and hooded, their face obscured by a shimmering veil.

"Who are you?" I ask, my voice echoing across the  plane.

The figure raises a hand, and the veil falls away, revealing a face that is both familiar and alien. It is my own face, yet twisted and distorted, a grotesque reflection of my innermost self.

"I am you," the figure says, its voice a raspy whisper. "I am the part of you that you fear, the part that you try to suppress."

I take a step back, my heart pounding in my chest. "No, this can't be real. This has to be wrong."

The figure chuckles, a sound like shattering glass. "Oh, but it is real, dreamer. This is the truth that you cannot face, the darkness that lurks within your very soul."

A bolt of electric fear and panic surges through me as I realize the truth of the figure's words. I try to turn, to flee from this nightmare, but I find myself frozen in place, unable to move.

The figure steps closer, its eyes burning with an intensity that sears my soul. "You cannot escape, dreamer. You cannot hide from yourself."

With a swift, decisive motion, the figure reaches out and grasps me by the throat, its grip like a vice. I struggle and flail, but it is useless. The figure pulls me closer, its fetid breath hot on my face.

"You will face your fears, dreamer," it hisses, its voice a chorus of snakes. "You will embrace your destiny."

With those final words, the figure releases me, and I find myself plummeting through the vast expanse of shimmering white, screaming in terror as the dream world crumbles around me.

I awake with a start, my heart racing and my body drenched in sweat. It takes me several moments toorient myself, to realize that I am safe in my bed, that the nightmare is over.

But even as I lie there, catching my breath and trying to calm my racing thoughts, I cannot shake the feeling that the dream was a warning, a sign of something greater that is yet to come.

I look to the wrist-worn commodore transmitter- nothing transmits, and no messages have been received.  Curiously, I look to the computer, and find a message has been received.  It's from the Surface Protectorate.

I reach for the computer with a clammy hand.
