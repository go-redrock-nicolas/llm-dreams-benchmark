I am dreaming.

The quake comes without warning, the floor lurching beneath us like the bucking spine of a waking giant. Walls fracture with a groaning, earthy roar—a sound so vast it swallows all other noise. Lights flicker, then fail. Ceiling panels crash down, and fractured beams rain dust as the room collapses into a maze of twisted metal and splintered stone. 

I find myself sprawled in a pocket of space—a fallen pillar propped against a half-collapsed wall, creating a narrow, stifling shelter. Around me, darkness presses in from every side. The air is thick with chalky grit, dry and heavy, every breath gritty and hard-won. My chest hurts, every inhale shorter and shallower. I can hear muffled cries and coughing. People—living, desperate, clinging together in the dark.

Panic rises, hot and electric as wildfire. Shaking fingers fumble for a lost phone, but it is crushed, its glass dead and black. Somewhere nearby, someone sobs in the darkness. Another’s voice trembles: “Is anyone there?”

Above us, dust sifts from invisible cracks. The building groans again—a terrible reminder that more weight could fall with any tremor. My mind reels, but I force myself to focus. I listen—really listen—for voices, for gaps in the debris above. I call out gently, trying not to waste precious air. “If you can hear me, knock twice!” Through the dark, faint thuds respond—a code of hope.

I feel along the gritty stone, palm searching for an opening, any draft of cooler air. I press my ear against a cold slab. On the other side, I hear ragged breathing, the choked hopefulness of people not yet ready to give in.

“Let’s all count to three, then shout,” I suggest, voice still. “Rescuers might hear us!” Others murmur agreement—a fragile thread of unity in the dark. Our cries join, echoing up through the shattered bones of the building. The stale air vibrates with our hope.

Suddenly, a peal of laughter bursts from the darkness—a child, unburdened for a moment by fear. The sound ripples through us, forging thin bonds of courage. I squeeze a stranger’s hand blindly, and in that small gesture find a pulse of strength, a shared determination.

We are buried, yes—but together. And above our heads glimmers a fragile faith in daylight, filtering down through muffled cries and shifting earth, as we wait for rescue, bracing ourselves to survive until it comes.
