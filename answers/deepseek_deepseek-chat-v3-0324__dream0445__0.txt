I am dreaming. The walls of reality melt like wax, revealing a vast inner landscape where my psyche stretches out before me like an endless hall of mirrors.  Each mirror reflects not my face, but scenes from my life - moments where praise landed on deaf ears while harsh words sunk their teeth deep.

A golden bridge appears before me, its planks inscribed with compliments whispered over the years.  "You're so talented" shines in elegant script, but the boards crumble beneath my hesitant steps.  Simultaneously, a rickety bridge of splintered wood, nailed together with cruel remarks, seems sturdier somehow.  The air hums with the dissonance of this paradox.

Three shadowy figures emerge from the mist - Wisdom with her owl-eyed gaze, Compassion wearing robes of liquid moonlight, and Courage whose armor is forged from broken masks.  They lead me to a clearing where two trees grow from a single trunk.  One bears golden fruit that turns to ash when I reach for it, the other bears thorny fruit that bleeds when plucked, yet I keep returning to its painful branches.

As dream-logic dictates, the trees speak in rustling whispers: "We grew from the same soil of your childhood." Suddenly I'm nine years again, hiding drawings after overhearing "Don't encourage her pride," then seventeen burning a poem when told "This could be better." The memories crystallize into fireflies, swarming to form a constellation - my personal mythology of unworthiness.

The dream shifts; Wisdom hands me a scale.  On one side I place every dismissive "oh it was nothing," every deflected "you're too kind." The other side receives each internalized "I should have done better," every swallowed "they're probably right." The scale tips violently, and where the weights fall, cracks spiderweb across the dreamscape revealing...

A luminous underground river where liquid light flows.  The figures guide me to drink, and as the light fills me, the mirrors transform.  Now they reflect not just memories, but possibilities - me receiving praise fully, standing tall in accomplishments, embracing flaws without venom.  The golden bridge repairs itself as I practice saying "thank you" to imagined compliments.

I wake with a start, fingertips tingling as if I've truly touched that liquid light, the afterimage of those transformed mirrors burned into my waking sight. The dream's message lingers like the taste of some exotic fruit - both familiar and utterly new.
