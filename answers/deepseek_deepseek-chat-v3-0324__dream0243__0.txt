I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and the faintest whisper of rain, as though the sky can't decide whether to weep or remain silent. A cobblestone path stretches out before me, winding through a garden where the flowers seem to pulse with color, their petals curling and unfurling like fingertips beckoning me forward. I know this path—it leads to a courtyard fringed with ivy, where a figure stands beneath the veiled moonlight, their presence both magnetic and elusive.  

Their silhouette is familiar, but their features shift like sand through an hourglass—sometimes their smile is warm enough to melt stone, their gaze locking onto mine with a quiet intensity that makes my ribs ache. Other times, their expression is frosted glass, distant and unreadable, their body language pulling away when I step closer.  

Tonight, the flickers of connection come in sparks—brush of fingers that lingers a heartbeat too long, a murmured joke that makes their laughter wrap around me like velvet. Then, like the inevitable turn of the tide, they move back, glancing at the horizon as if waiting for something (someone?) else. My chest tightens with the push-pull ache of it.  

A wise old oak near the courtyard’s edge rustles its leaves in a language I suddenly understand. *"They are a storm,"* it murmurs, *"one moment thunder, the next silence. You cannot build a home in someone who refuses to stay."*  

The wind picks up, swirling around me, tugging at my sleeves like an insistent friend. I close my eyes and breathe. When I open them, the courtyard is empty. The cobblestones beneath me begin to glow—golden light spilling between the cracks, leading not toward the vanishing figure, but outward, where the garden stretches wild and untamed.  

Somewhere in the dream, I realize: yearning for inconsistency is like cupping a flame in bare hands. Warmth, yes—until the burn. When I turn, the ivy behind me has bloomed into vibrant, defiant scarlet, petals falling like confetti at my feet. The path ahead is still mine to choose.
