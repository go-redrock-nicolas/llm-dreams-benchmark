I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a precipice, the wind whipping my hair into a frenzy as I watch a figure below, their silhouette hazy against the smoldering embers of a dying fire. It's someone I know, someone I care about deeply, but their identity remains shrouded, obscured by the swirling smoke and the turmoil churning in my heart.

As I watch, the figure begins to move, their steps tapering and tentative as they edge towards a chasm, a deep and yawning void that seems to devour the light around it. My mind screams a wordless warning, my hands reaching out as if to snatch them back from the brink, but my arms remain stubbornly still, frozen in place like a statue. 

The figure takes another step forward, and another, each one a deliberate move towards oblivion. I can feel the despair rising in my throat, choking the cries that long to break free. Why won't they listen? Why can't they see the danger, the ruin that awaits them on this path? My breath is caught in a strangled sob as I realize they've chosen to ignore my pleas, to dismiss my warnings as irrelevant.

The landscape shifts and morphs around me like a living, breathing creature. The fire gutters and extinguishes, plunging us into darkness, and I reach out with my fingertips, desperate to reconnect with the figure that's fading into the shadows. My hand passes through their arm, and I feel the loss like a searing brand, the pain echoing through every straining nerve.

In the distance, a melody begins, its notes like tiny shards of glass cutting through the hazy air. I recognize the song, a lullaby from my childhood, but here it's twisted and discordant, a mockery of the original. The figure sings along, their voice strained but defiant, as if they're determined to drown out any dissenting opinions.

I'm drowning in an ocean of anguish, the waves crashing against the rocky shores of my mind. Every fiber of my being wants to save them, to pluck them from the path of self-destruction and steer them towards safer waters. But my limbs remain heavy, weighed down by the weight of their pride and the handicap of their unwillingness to listen.

Ather in churning confusion, I'm jolted awake by the shrill wail of an alarm clock, the dream clinging to my skin like a damp fever. My heart races as I struggle to disentangle reality from fantasy, the vivid images and instincts of the nocturne slowly bleeding away into the cruel light of day. But the memory of the dream lingers, a haunting specter, reminding me that in the waking world, we're not always granted the power to save the souls we love most. Sometimes, all we can do is watch and pray, and hope that they'll find their way through the mire of their own making.
