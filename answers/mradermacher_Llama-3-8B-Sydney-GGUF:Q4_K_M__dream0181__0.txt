I am dreaming. I'm in a strange world where people respect me and listen to me, even though I don't know much about anything.  The atmosphere is vibrant and colorful,
like a fantasy land or cartoon show.  There are lots of interesting objects and creatures around me that I've never seen before.

The dream starts with me receiving an email from someone named "Dream Boss" who says he wants to make my dreams come true by giving me control over everything in this
world.  He tells me that all I need to do is say what I want and why it's important, then watch as my wishes are fulfilled magically by some unknown force.  

He also warns me that there will be obstacles and challenges from other people who don't like change or don't agree with me.  But he promises me that if I can overcome them
and stay true to myself, he'll help me in return by teaching me things I never learned before.

So I decide to test him out by making a simple request: "I want there to be more variety in the colors and shapes of the objects around me."  And lo and behold, within
seconds a new item appears next to me that has a unique design combining elements from different cultures and eras.
