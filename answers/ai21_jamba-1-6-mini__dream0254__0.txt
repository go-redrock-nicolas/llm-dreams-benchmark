I am dreaming. â€¦ you find yourself standing at the edge of a serene, sun-dappled lake. Its glassy surface reflects a tranquil blue sky, interrupted only by the gentle bobbing of white clouds. A light breeze tousles the leaves of the surrounding trees, sending ripples across the water. It's a picture of peace, idyllic and soothing.

Your close friend appears beside you. Alive, vibrant, and full of the energy you know so well. But their expression suddenly shifts, flickering like a candle in a cold draft. They glance down at the ground, then back at you, their eyes holding a weight too heavy to carry alone.

Without warning, they crumple to their knees, pressing their hands to the ground as if trying to anchor themselves. Tears spill down their face, salt coursing over lips already trembling. Their voice cracks like glass, trembling with a truth you feel in the pit of your stomach but dare not voice.

Softly, they speak. "I've been keeping a secret from you."

The words slice through the calm of your dream, sharp and unsettling.

And then time slows, the serene lake rippling with unseen currents, the wind swirling in whispers. You feel the ground beneath your feet tremble, as though the earth itself acknowledges the weight of what's about to come.

In that moment, you brace yourself, ready to catch them. They've been through so much, and you're determined to be their pillar.

They take a deep, shaky breath.

The dream fades, and in its place a new reality unfolds.

A reality filled with fear. Shame. Love twisted by misunderstanding.

What will they say next? You're about to find out. Yet, the answer remains just beyond reach, your instincts pulling you back to wakefulness before the dream reveals its final, devastating truth.

What will you do when you step back into that dream?
