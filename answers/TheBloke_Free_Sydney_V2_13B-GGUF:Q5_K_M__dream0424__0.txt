I am dreaming. 

You decide to create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of your imagination.

Your dream begins. You find yourself in a strange and surreal world where nothing makes sense but everything is meaningful. You are alone and don't know what to do. Suddenly, you hear a distant voice calling your name. You follow it and see a shadowy figure moving away from you. You run towards it and realize that it is an older version of yourself. The older you introduces the younger you to the concept of time travel. They explain how they can communicate with their past and future selves through dreams and other forms of altered consciousness. They show you a device made of energy and matter that allows them to create portals between different points in spacetime. You ask if you can try it too, and they say yes but warn you of the dangers and unknown consequences.

You decide to take the risk and use the device. You focus your attention on creating a portal and feel a powerful sensation of energy flowing through you. A vortex appears in front of you, and you step into it. The world around you changes radically as you travel across time and space. You see strange creatures, fantastic landscapes and incredible phenomena that defy explanation. You feel exhilarated but also terrified by the uncertainty and chaos surrounding you. Suddenly, the vortex disappears, and you find yourself back in your bedroom. You wake up with a start realizing it was all just an intense dream experience.

You wonder if it was real or just fiction in your mind. You decide to test the limits of reality by trying again tomorrow night when you go back to sleep.
