I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me unfurls like a tapestry woven from the threads of memory and wonder. I find myself standing in a vast, ethereal meadow, where the grass shimmers with a silvery glow, as if kissed by moonlight even though the sky above burns with the golden hues of a perpetual sunrise. Each blade of grass hums softly, a chorus of whispers that seem to call forth fragments of my past, childhood moments that flicker like fireflies in the air around me.

I walk barefoot, feeling the cool, velvety earth beneath my feet, and as I move forward, the landscape shifts. The meadow melts into the familiar backyard of my childhood home, but it is not as I remember it. The swing set where I once soared toward the sky now towers like a giant’s throne, its chains gleaming like molten gold, creaking with a rhythm that mimics the heartbeat of time itself. I climb onto the swing, and with each push, I’m launched not just upward, but backward through the years. Laughter echoes—my own, high-pitched and carefree, mingled with the voices of friends who once shared scraped knees and secret hideouts with me. 

As I swing, the air ripples, and I see myself as a child, small and wide-eyed, hiding beneath the kitchen table during a thunderstorm. My mother’s hand reaches down, warm and steady, pulling me into her embrace. But in this dream, her touch blooms into a cascade of light, and I understand something profound. That safety, that unwavering reassurance, taught me to seek comfort in connection, to crave bonds that feel like shelters from life’s storms. Yet, I see now, it also planted a seed of fear—fear of abandonment, of being left in the dark when the thunder rolls again. My current relationships, the way I cling too tightly or hesitate to trust, are shadows cast by that childhood lightning.

The swing slows, and I step off into a new scene. I’m in the schoolyard now, the asphalt shimmering like a mirage. A circle of children surrounds me, their faces blurred but their words sharp as shattered glass. They tease, they push, and I feel the sting of exclusion, the ache of wanting to belong. But in this dream, I don’t shrink. Instead, I stretch my arms wide, and my body transforms into a great willow tree, roots sinking deep into the earth, branches reaching out to shelter those same children. I realize that the pain of rejection shaped me too—made me a seeker of approval, someone who sometimes bends too far to keep others close, fearing the sting of being cast out again.

The dream shifts once more, and I stand at the edge of a boundless ocean, its waves a deep indigo, frothing with secrets. Each wave crashes against the shore, washing up relics of my past— a worn teddy bear, a crumpled drawing, a tiny shoe. I pick them up, one by one, and as I hold them, they dissolve into light, merging with my skin. I feel a warmth spreading through me, a quiet understanding. These childhood experiences, both the tender and the bruising, are not just scars or burdens. They are the foundation of how I love, how I fear, how I connect. The need for safety taught me to cherish closeness, but also to guard my heart. The sting of rejection taught me empathy, but also the instinct to please at my own expense.

I wade into the ocean now, the water cool and embracing, and as I dive beneath the surface, I see my relationships shimmering like coral reefs—intricate, beautiful, sometimes jagged. There’s the partner I held too tightly, afraid they’d slip away like my mother’s hand in a storm. There’s the friend I overextended myself for, desperate to be liked, echoing that schoolyard longing. But under the water, I don’t feel weighed down by these patterns. Instead, I feel a current of forgiveness, for myself most of all. I see that awareness is a kind of freedom—I can choose to reshape these tides, to love without suffocating, to trust without losing myself.

As I surface, the ocean transforms into a mirror, vast and endless, reflecting not just my face but every version of me: the child trembling in a storm, the kid on the playground, the adult navigating love and loss. I smile at them all, and the mirror shatters into a thousand butterflies, each one carrying a piece of insight, fluttering into a sky that now blazes with every color of dawn. I wake with their wings still brushing against my soul, knowing that understanding my past doesn’t erase its impact, but it gives me the power to dream—and to live—differently.
