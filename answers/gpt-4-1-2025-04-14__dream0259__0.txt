I am dreaming. am suddenly weightless, as if my guilt has made my soul buoyant and rootless. The room around me warps with the colors of shame—a sickly, swirling indigo and bruised violet. Shadows stretch and contract on the walls, shaped like accusatory fingers. The person I’ve hurt stands before me, their face flickering with disappointment and sorrow; I can’t quite focus on their features, they blur like watercolour splashed by tears.

My words fall from my lips like shattered glass—each apology morphing into a tiny, translucent bird that tries to reach them, but shatters midair and rains down, tinkling on the floor. The silence is thick, syrupy and stifling, pressing down on my chest. 

Desperate for forgiveness or understanding, I reach out, but my arms grow heavy and long, stretching through a fog that curls with the scent of bitter regret. My heart pulses in my throat. Beyond the person’s eyes, I see an endless corridor spiraling away, lined with mirrors that flash scenes of our happiest moments, then twist them into memories marred by my mistake, over and over—a relentless carousel of would-have-beens.

A single tear escapes down their cheek, glinting like a falling star. The sight carves a hollow in my core, and suddenly the floor beneath me shatters, giving way to an abyss. I tumble, grasping at fragments of shared laughter and whispered secrets, but they slip through my fingers. The darkness below is soft and velvety, but inside, the ache glows molten.

Just as despair begins to claim me, the darkness ripples, and a garden of white lotus blooms silently all around—the petals dripping with light, offering the hush of possibility, of forgiveness, of hope yet undrowned. The air quivers with the song of distant bells, gentle and hesitant, as if the dream itself isn’t sure if healing is possible.

I awaken, the ache lingering, the promise of those luminous flowers blooming quietly within me.
