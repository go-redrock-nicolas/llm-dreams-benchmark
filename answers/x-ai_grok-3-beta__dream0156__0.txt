I am dreaming. I’m lying in a vast, endless field under a twilight sky that shimmers with hues of violet and indigo, the kind of sky that seems to hum with secrets. The air feels heavy with a strange, electric buzz, and as I sit up, I notice my hands are glowing faintly, tiny pixels of light fracturing off my skin like digital dandruff. My phone is clutched in my palm, its screen so bright it casts jagged shadows across the grass, which sways not with the wind but in rhythm with unseen notifications—ding, ding, ding—each chime rippling through the field like a shockwave.

I glance at the device, and my screen time report glares back at me: 18 hours and 47 minutes today. The numbers pulse like a heartbeat, growing larger, redder, until they’re towering over me, a skyscraper of guilt carved in crimson digits. My throat tightens. I try to drop the phone, but it’s fused to my hand, the glass melting into my skin, tendrils of code curling up my arm like ivy made of ones and zeroes. Panic surges through me, but there’s no escape—I’m tethered to this endless scroll.

Suddenly, the field around me morphs. The grass pixelates, breaking into jagged blocks, glitchy and stuttering, as if the world itself is buffering. I’m no longer in a meadow but inside a labyrinth of glowing screens, each one floating in midair, displaying fragments of my life consumed online: memes I’ve laughed at, arguments I’ve lurked on, reels I’ve watched on loop until my eyes burned. The screens close in, their light searing, and I hear voices—hundreds, thousands—commenting, liking, tagging, a cacophony of digital chatter that drowns out my thoughts. My reflection stares back from every screen, but it’s not me—it’s a hollow version, eyes glassy, face pale as a ghost, thumbs twitching endlessly over an invisible keyboard.

I stumble forward, desperate to escape, and fall through a screen into a surreal, distorted version of my own life. I’m sitting at a dinner table with friends, but their faces are obscured by glowing avatars, their laughter replaced by canned emoji reactions—, , —blinking above their heads. My food is a pile of pixelated emojis too, unchewable, tasteless. I try to speak, but my words come out as hashtags, #help #trapped #logout, floating uselessly into the air before dissolving. The room darkens, and a notification banner unfurls across the ceiling: “You’ve missed 3,472 real moments. Update your life to continue?” I slam my fist on the table, but it only triggers a cascade of “like” animations, thumbs-up icons raining down until I’m buried under their weight.

Gasping, I claw my way out and find myself on a cliff overlooking an ocean of liquid data, waves of blue light crashing with the sound of a million keyboards clacking at once. Above, a colossal clock looms, its hands spinning backward, each tick echoing the hours I’ve lost—days, weeks, years—stolen by the glow of a screen. My chest aches with the weight of it, the realization that while I’ve been scrolling, life has been happening without me. I’ve traded sunsets for filters, conversations for comments, presence for posts.

But then, a faint warmth brushes my face. Far on the horizon, beyond the digital sea, a sliver of authentic sunlight pierces through, untainted by pixels or algorithms. It’s small, fragile, but real. My phone, still melded to my hand, vibrates violently, demanding attention, but I grit my teeth and focus on that sliver of light. With every ounce of will, I pry my fingers open, ripping the device from my flesh—painful, raw, but liberating. Wires snap, code fragments scream as they dissolve, and I hurl the phone into the ocean of data below. It sinks with a pitiful glitch, swallowed by the waves.

The labyrinth of screens begins to crumble, pixels cascading like sand through an hourglass. The field returns, but it’s different now—wildflowers bloom in vibrant, unfiltered colors, and the air smells of earth, not electricity. The twilight sky softens, stars emerging one by one, each a tiny promise of presence. I lie back in the grass, free of the glow, and for the first time in what feels like forever, I hear my own breathing, steady and alive. The compulsion to check, to scroll, to escape into the digital void fades, replaced by a quiet resolve: I will reclaim my time, my attention, my life.

As the dream lingers, a breeze carries whispers of the real world waking beyond the horizon. I know when I open my eyes, the challenge awaits—to live not through a screen, but with open hands, ready to touch, to feel, to be. And for the first time, I’m not afraid of logging out.
