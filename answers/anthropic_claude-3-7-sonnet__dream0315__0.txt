I am dreaming. The sky above me morphs between impossible colors—deep indigos that somehow glow like embers, and translucent golds that pour like honey through the atmosphere. I stand at the edge of a vast library that extends beyond the horizon, its shelves reaching so high they disappear into clouds that drift indoors. Each book breathes softly, their pages gently fluttering like the wings of sleeping butterflies.

As I walk forward, my footsteps leave luminescent footprints that slowly transform into wildflowers. I've been here before. Many times. Always searching for something I can't quite name.

A grandfather clock stands in the center of an atrium, its hands moving counterclockwise, sometimes rapidly, sometimes barely at all. Around its base, small pools of water reflect not my face but different versions of myself at various ages—some I recognize from my past, others I've yet to become.

Ravens perch on reading tables, their feathers occasionally dissolving into streams of flowing script that reassemble elsewhere. They watch me with knowing eyes that contain galaxies. One opens its beak and the sound of my mother's voice emerges, reciting a poem I've never heard but somehow know by heart.

Doorways appear between shelves, leading to staircases that spiral impossibly—some ascending through ceiling panels of stained glass, others descending into gentle oceans contained impossibly within the floor. I know certain doors call to me more than others.

The air smells of cinnamon, old paper, and petrichor—that distinctive scent after rain—though the library remains dry despite the waters within it. Each breath I take seems to fill me with memories that aren't mine yet feel intimately familiar.

I reach for a book whose spine glows brighter than the others. As my fingers touch its leather binding, it dissolves into a swarm of golden butterflies that form words in the air before me:

"The key you seek has always been behind your reflection."
