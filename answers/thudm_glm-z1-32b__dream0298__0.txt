I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and the faint hum of insects from a distant bog.  My feet sink into a carpet of emerald moss as I wander a path that curves through a forest of bioluminescent trees. Their bark pulses with a soft cerulean glow, casting long, trembling shadows that dance on the stones beneath me.  Suddenly, a shaft of sunlight pierces the canopy, revealing a clearing lined with monolithic quartz pillars, each etched with swirling galaxies.  At the center of this clearing stands a mirror, not of glass, but of liquid mercury, reflecting not my outer self, but an inner landscape I've never seen—vast, starry plains stretching to horizons that bend and warp like water.  In this reflection, I see myself as a child, sitting alone on a hilltop, her laughter echoing through the valley.  A gentle wind carries a voice, soft as a sigh: "You are enough."  The words ripple across the mercury like ink in water, but instead of fading, they crystallize into constellations.  I wake up, but the taste of rain and the warmth of that compassion linger in the recesses of my mind, a silent echo of a dream too vivid to forget.
As I drift into the realm of REM sleep, my subconscious weaves a tapestry of paradox. The air is dense with the musk of wet wool, yet featherlight, pressing against my skin like the first breath of dawn after a century-long hibernation. Below me, the ground shifts—not solid earth, but a liquid expanse of mercury that mirrors the ciel above, where constellations drip like liquid nitrogen onto a canvas of indigo. My reflection fractures into a billion selves: one me races across a field of burning wheat, another hovers mid-air, above a crevasse of liquid shadow. A memory surfaces—vivid, visceral—of breaking a vase my grandmother cherished. In waking hours, I’d have clawed at my own reflection in the shower, screaming into a cloud of steam. Here, though, the fragments of me begin to stitch themselves together with threads of stardust. Each is accompanied by the sound of a loom, rhythmic yet without pattern, the heartbeat of a planet. A translucent figure appears, not human, but a constellation personified—made of light that fractures into prismatic particles when touched. It reaches out and places a hand on the vase’s remnants, which begin to re-form, not as ceramic, but as a cluster of succulents sprouting from the shards. The scent of wet soil mingles with lavender, the kind my mother used to burn when I confessed my fears of inadequacy. The succulents bloom into flowers that drip with liquid light, and as they fall, they paint the air with hieroglyphs of apology in a language I only half-remember: one word means “unbroken,” another whispers, “you carried the weight of galaxies and forgot to carry yourself.” The crescent moon overhead tilts closer, its silver glow settling like a cloak. I wake, the sheets pooled around me, but the taste of iron (not blood, but courage) lingers on my tongue. The ceiling fan hums, and for a split second, I half-expect the shadows to unravel into constellations.
