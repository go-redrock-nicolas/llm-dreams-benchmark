I am dreaming. Suddenly, my mind feels different—a strange, vibrant energy thrums beneath my skull. I realize I've gained photographic memory. Every sight, sound, and sensation since birth is stored here, crisp and untouched. I can replay moments like flipping through a photo album, but in HD.\n

First, I test it. I think of my fifth birthday party. The kitchen’s floral wallpaper, the sticky cake, laughter of my friends—it all floods back. But wait, there's more. I can zoom into details previously unnoticed: a single freckle on my mom’s nose, the way sunlight dappled the floor, even the exact shade of blue in Seth's shirt. Time seems to bend; I can move forward or backward through the memory at any speed.\n

Ecstatic, I start diving deeper. I recall every book I’ve ever read, every conversation, every fleeting daydream. But then, a strange thing happens. The memories start to interact. My childhood dog trots into my current room. The scent of my grandma’s perfume lingers in the air. I hear my best friend’s laugh from age twelve ringing in the present moment. Reality and memory blur into a surreal tapestry.\n

Suddenly, portals open—glowing, swirling vortexes in every corner of my room. Each one leads to a specific memory. I walk through one, stepping into the classroom where I aced my first math test. The desks, the chalkboard, even the musty smell are perfect replicas. But when I touch the desk, numbers float up, morphing into equations I’ve never seen before. They're beautiful, glowing symbols that dance like fireflies.\n

Another portal calls me. Stepping through, I’m in a sunlit meadow from a summer day I barely remember. The grass is impossibly green, and the sky stretches endlessly. Here, my memories become physical. I can shape them into objects—a vase made of my tenth birthday, a sculpture from my first heartbreak. They're fragile, though. If I press too hard, they shatter into glittering fragments that fade when touched.\n

Then comes the warning. A voice—not mine—echoes: “Beware the weight of infinity.” The room spins. Memories I’ve buried surge forward: fears, regrets, pain. They manifest as sharp, thorned vines that whip at my ankles. I can feel every heartbeat from moments of panic, every tear shed. It’s overwhelming, a storm of sensation. I realize this power is a double-edged sword.\n

I retreat to the present, clinging to its normalcy. But the dream shifts again. The boundaries between memories dissolve. I’m simultaneously in a hundred moments: swimming as a kid, presenting a project at work, lying in a hospital bed. My consciousness fractures, yet remains whole. I’m everywhere and nowhere, a constellation of experiences.\n

Finally, dawn tinges my dream sky. The energy fades. The portals seal. The vines wilt. For now, the memories settle, but I know they’re still there, waiting. When I awake, I touch my palms—their warmth lingers, a phantom echo of the dream’s infinity.
