I am dreaming. **The Storm’s Heart**  
The ship groans like a dying titan as waves slice over the deck, their crests clawing at the sky. The air tastes of salt and iron, the storm’s breath lashing your face with stinging rain. Above, the clouds churn charcoal and violet, coiled into a vortex that gnashes with forks of crimson lightning—unnatural, almost alive. Your crew clings to rigging and railings, their eyes wild moons in the gloom, shouting words the wind rips away before they reach your ears. 

But *you* hear it—a low, resonant hum beneath the chaos, a pulse thrumming through the hull. The sea isn’t just angry. It’s *hunting*. 

You stagger toward the helm, boots slipping on planks slick with something darker than seawater. Black tar, iridescent like oiled raven feathers, oozes from the ship’s timbers. The wheel burns under your palms, searing glyphs into your skin—ancient symbols that flicker gold before fading. A shadow passes beneath the waves, vast and serpentine, its scales glinting like drowned stars. 

“*Captain!*” screams the navigator, pointing astern. The storm splits, revealing a fissure in the sea—a yawning abyss where the water cascades inward, pulling the ship toward its maw. But within the vortex, there’s light: a submerged city, its spires twisted coral and bone, glowing with bioluminescent veins. A melody rises, dissonant and magnetic, sung by voices that are not human. 

You wrench the wheel hard to port. The ship shudders, timbers screaming, as you carve a path toward the abyss. The crew’s panic melts into awe. The city’s light etches their faces in hues of cerulean and jade, and for a heartbeat, the storm stills. A figure materializes on the forecastle—a woman woven from brine and thunder, her hair a stormcloud, eyes two vortexes. She presses a spiraled conch into your hands. Its whispers flood your mind: *“…anchor the tempest…become the bridge…”* 

Then, the dream fractures. 

The sea flips. You’re falling upward into the vortex, crew and ship unraveling into stardust. Below, the city dissolves into a single eye—a black pupil framed by galaxies. It blinks. 

You wake gasping, salt on your lips, the conch’s echo still humming in your veins. The storm is gone. The ship sits becalmed on a mirror-still sea, its sails painted scarlet by a sun that wasn’t there before. On the horizon, a whale breaches, its song harmonizing with the conch. 

The crew murmurs, pointing at your hands. The helm’s glyphs now glow faintly on your palms. A map, perhaps. Or a covenant. 

The real storm, you realize, has only just begun.
