I am dreaming. A warm, golden sun is dipping low, casting elongated shadows across the parched earth of the presently abandonedasian steppe. The grasses rustle, whispering secrets to the crisp autumn breeze, as I traverse this desolate landscape once familiar, now alien. My journey begins, not from the trail of my past, but from the forked path of memories yet unformed.

I reach a weathered milestone, its fading inscription revealing it to be a milestone marked 1000. Awaiting me there, seemingly detached from time, is my childhood self. My younger self is intrigued by the rock, tracing the numbers with chubby fingers, brow furrowed in concentration. As I approach, our eyes meet - recognition, curiosity, and a touch of fear flicker across their childlike irises. I extend my hand, and we embark on this journey together, our shared orbit tilting towards the unknown.

Our first stop is the long-abandoned train station, its once grandeur now a mere shadow. The echo of my childhood laughter bounces off the empty platform, accompanied by the ghostly whistle of a train that never arrives. Yet, today, a moth-eaten timetable  flapstancy announces an unexpected arrival. The station clock ticks in reverse, and the early morning sun retreats, casting the scene in cold moonlight. A lone train pulls in, its carriage doors adorned with symbols of constellations. An invitation from the cosmos, we step aboard.

The train rumbles to life, gliding through the night, carrying us through landscapes untouched by time. Past the humble thatched-roof farmhouse where my grandmother once greeted me with warmézçuk  means "honey" in Russian, her voice echoing with love, and the dense forest where I lost my first tooth to a wooden goblin's trap. Each scene is vivid, yet distorted, like an impressionist painting viewed through a kaleidoscope.

We disembark at a halt named 'First Light'. The sun is rising, casting a rosy glow on the serene lake before us. A boat awaits, on which sits an old fisherman - a younger version of me. He speaks in riddles, his voice deep and resonating, "In the lake of tomorrow, the fish of yesterday is caught. Look beyond the reflection, and you shall see what has always been." With a gentle push, he sends us off, the boat gliding effortlessly towards the center.

The lake's surface is glass, reflecting the heavens and clouds, creating an optical illusion of infinity. I look beyond the reflection, and a portal opens up, revealing a submerged world filled with memories I had forgotten. I dive in, my younger self following suit, sinking deeper into the abyssal Treasure trove of our shared past.

We swim through schools of forgotten joys and sorrows, each memory a vibrant burst of color, each current tugging us towards a different narrative. We dance with our first love beneath the stars, watch in awe as that very love turns into heartache, then comfort each other, stronger for the storm. We witness our first hearty laugh, our first steps, our first failures, and triumphs. We are never-ending in our exploration, yet never Get to the bottom.

Suddenly, a shadow looms above, breaking the surface of our consciousness. A monstrous figure emerges, its form ever-changing, reflecting our deepest fears and insecurities. It attacks, its tendrils clawing at our memories, threatening to consume us. But we stand our ground, united. We defy it, embracing our past, accepting our flaws, and celebrating our triumphs. The beast recoils, dissolving into the lake, leaving behind a serene surface once again.

We resurface, gasping for breath, yet invigorated. The old fisherman is waiting, arms outstretched. He helps us onto the boat, smiling wryly, "You've found what you were looking for. Remember, the past is a companion, not a prison." The train awaits, its destinations now crystal clear. As we board, the constellation doors close behind us, sealing our new understanding. The train picks up speed, carrying us back to the present, to the future, guided by the light of our past. The dream fades, but the lessons remain, indelible, like the path of a shooting star across the night sky.
