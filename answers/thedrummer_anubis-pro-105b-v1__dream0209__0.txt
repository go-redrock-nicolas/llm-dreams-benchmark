I am dreaming. My mind is shaping the landscape of a fantasy world. In this dream, I'm transported to a mystical realm where the very forces of nature have been turned on their head. Gravity pulls sideways instead of down, rendering the concept of up and down obsolete. Vibrant flora defy this sideways gravity, their petal-like leaves reaching out horizontally as if in a perpetual embrace of the sky.

To move through this wild yet wondrous place, I find myself learning a new mode of locomotion. I spread my arms and let a gentle breeze lift me, sending me floating like a feather until I catch onto the leaves of dancing flowers. I swing and spring from one to the other, leaping across the expanse of horizontal space with fluid grace.

As I travel further into the unknown, I begin to notice other inhabitants of this realm. Strange creatures dart and flit about, their perpetually Sext another dimension reshaping their very forms. Perhaps a pack of ghostly wolves streaks by, their ethereal howls echoing through the air. Or maybe I witness a butterfly with wings that shimmer and undulate like the surface of rippling water.

Every step I take reveals new marvels, fresh wonders that challenge my perceptions and broaden my understanding. This world feels as real as my waking one, though its stagnant nature is at odds with my living reality. I'm grateful for this dream, for the opportunity to explore the depths of my own mind.

And yet, as I wander deeper into this fantasy, I wonder when I might awaken. I want to have one more perspective, one other view of this place. To answer that, I generate an avatar of myself from the raw, primeval matter of this realm. I enter it as it mortlocks into an entity, self-aware but passively following the rules of this place.

Deasn the dream within a dream, everything seems realer than ever. The colors are even more vivid, the sensations even more acute. I push harder, my external mind setting limits and rules within the dream avatar as long as I don't stop the internal world.
