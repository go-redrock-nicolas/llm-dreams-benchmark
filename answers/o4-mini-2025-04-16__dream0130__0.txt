I am dreaming. I am falling again—only this time the ground is not earth but the tattered remains of every life I’ve ever built. Beneath my feet lie shards of glass chandeliers from my first prosperous mansion, rusted girders from my second factory, yellowed maps from the desert colony I founded on my third rebirth. All of them fracture and spin away like constellations dissolving in a black sea.  

I drift through that void and the weight of five failures pulls at my limbs, but I feel no fear—only the strange serenity of someone who’s learned to swim in collapse. Above me, enormous petals of moonlight unfold, each one inscribed with a memory: laughter echoing down marble halls, the hiss of steel machines roaring back to life, the hush of golden sands under my desert-built caravan, the tinkle of crystalline towers hanging in a stormy sky, and the heartbeat of a living labyrinth made of gears and vines.  

Now, as those petals begin to wither, I glide into a sudden whirlwind: ribbons of electric blue wind carve runes across the darkness. Each rune pulses with a name I once carried, a fortitude I once claimed—“Hope,” “Courage,” “Rebirth.” They whisper through me, urging me to remember how I planted seeds in broken soil and watched them bloom.  

Below, a kaleidoscopic forest springs into being—trees of silver bark and leaves that glow like lanterns. Their roots tangle into the ruins I fall through, knitting new platforms of living wood. I step onto one, amazed that something so warm and green can grow from such ruin. The forest breathes, and in its exhale I hear five soft echoes: the voices of every version of myself urging me forward.  

Then the ground folds open, revealing a cavern lit by molten stars. I step in and see my reflections flickering on the walls—each one older, wiser, every face lined with the lessons of catastrophe. They reach out to me, palms pressed against the stone, and in their eyes I find a spark: the sixth ember of creation waiting to be struck.  

I cup my hand over that spark and—in the instant before everything collapses again— I blow. A tiny flame leaps to life and the cavern trembles. Stars rain down, melting the cavern walls into a river of light. I do not fall. I rise. And when I open my eyes, the new world is ready for me to build.
