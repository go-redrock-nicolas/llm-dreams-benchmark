I am dreaming. I find myself walking through an endless corridor of mirrors, each one reflecting not my physical form, but aspects of my personality. The corridor twists and shifts, the floor beneath me sometimes solid, sometimes transparent like glass suspended above swirling mists. The air feels charged, tingling against my skin with each breath.

As I move deeper, I notice certain mirrors growing larger, their reflections more intense. In one particularly ornate mirror framed with thorny vines, I see myself scowling at someone speaking too loudly in a library. The scene shifts, and suddenly I'm watching myself talk just as loudly at a café last week. The realization hits me like cold water—my irritation with others' volume actually reflects my own insecurity about taking up auditory space.

The corridor narrows, and the mirrors begin to pulse with a deep blue light. One mirror shows me criticizing a friend's indecisiveness while another simultaneously reveals my own paralysis when facing important choices. In another, I see myself judging someone's need for validation, even as my reflection desperately seeks approval from shadowy figures.

With each step, the mirrors reveal more projections—traits I've condemned in others that live within me. Perfectionism. Stubbornness. Fear of vulnerability. The mirrors don't accuse; they simply reveal with perfect clarity.

At the corridor's end stands a door made of light. As I approach it, the mirrors behind me shatter soundlessly, their fragments dissolving into sparkling dust. The recognition of my projection patterns doesn't feel shameful but liberating—a key unlocking a deeper understanding of myself.

As I reach for the brilliant doorknob, I understand that beyond lies not perfection, but integration—the chance to embrace all parts of myself with the same compassion I might offer others. The door opens to a garden where shadows and light dance in harmony, neither dominating the other.

I step through, feeling whole.
