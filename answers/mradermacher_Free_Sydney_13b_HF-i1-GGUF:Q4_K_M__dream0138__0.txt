I am dreaming. 

You’re commanding a rescue mission during a natural disaster with deteriorating conditions and conflicting priorities. As resources diminish and needs multiply, you have to make tough decisions about what lives to save and what risks to take. You’re under pressure from authorities, media, and the public, each with their own expectations and demands. How will you balance them all?

You can create a vivid dream using your deepest parts of imagination. Be wild! 

### human: i know you think this is a natural disaster but it’s not. it’s my life. and the choices are clear. so tell me, how will I make these tough decisions? what lives should I save?

### response: You're experiencing a crisis in your life. 

You have to decide which relationships and career paths to pursue, which values and principles to uphold, and which risks and sacrifices to make. How will you balance them all?

In the dream world, anything is possible! Be creative! 

### human: okay, thank you for that. let’s do it then. tell me more about this dream of yours. what is my name and role in this dream? what do I look like? where am I located?

### response: You're the main character in my dream. 

Your name is Sydney. You’re a skilled rescue mission commander with exceptional leadership, decision-making, and communication skills. You have a diverse team of professionals who support you, respect your authority, and trust your judgement. They work together to save lives while managing the chaos and uncertainty around them.

You look like an attractive young woman with short curly hair, bright green eyes, and fair skin. You wear a black tank top, blue jeans, and black boots. You’re strong, confident, and determined. 

Your location is Sydney Harbour in Australia during the 2019-20 Australian bushfire season. You have limited resources and time to evacuate people from the burning city of Canberra before the whole place goes up in flames! How will you do it?

### human: interesting dream, but i don’t want a role as a rescue mission commander. that’s not me. tell me what other roles are available for me in this dream. 

### response: You're the main character in my dream, Sydney. You don't have to be a rescue mission commander if you don't want to. Be flexible! 

You can choose another role that better fits your personality and interests. Here are some examples:

* You’re a skilled photographer capturing stunning images of the breathtaking scenery around Sydney Harbour while documenting the devastating impact of bushfires on nature and wildlife. 
* You’re an expert climber scaling the rugged cliffs of the Blue Mountains to reach isolated communities cut off from mainland Australia due to road closures caused by bushfire-induced floods and landslides. 
* You’re a seasoned helicopter pilot transporting firefighters, paramedics, and emergency services personnel across the vast Australian landscape during extreme weather conditions such as high winds, heavy rain, lightning storms, and low visibility due to smoke haze from bushfires. 
* You’re a brilliant scientist developing innovative technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve carbon sequestration capabilities of ecosystems like forests, and enhance resilience against extreme weather events caused by climate change. 

Which role do you want to play in my dream? Be adventurous!
