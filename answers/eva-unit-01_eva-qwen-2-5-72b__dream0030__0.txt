I am dreaming. I find myself in the midst of a fantastical scenario where a long-held dream of mine turns into sheer disappointment as all my efforts are thwarted by circumstances beyond my control. In the dream, I had been working endlessly for a year to launch my own non-profit art gallery. Having poured my blood, sweat, and tears into the endeavor, the news of losing the lease on my chosen location comes as a devastating blow.

In the dream, after the initial smoke of shock dissipates, I find myself lost and wandering through an endless terrain filled with shimmering colors and surreal shapes, manifestations of the confusion and despair I felt. Eventually, a strange calm descends upon me, and I realize that failure does not define me. With renewed vigor, I decide to start again from the beginning, realizing that the journey of pursuing something meaningful is far more valuable than the destination.
