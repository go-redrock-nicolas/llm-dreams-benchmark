I am dreaming. The air around me hums with an electric charge, thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth. Before me stands two doorways—one, a well-worn path bathed in warm, golden light, its edges softened by familiarity. The walls pulse gently, breathing in time with my heart, whispering assurances of safety, of predictability. Behind it, I can hear the echo of laughter, footsteps treading the same grooves, a lullaby of routine.  

The other doorway is different. It shifts, flickering between forms—sometimes an archway of twisting vines alive with bioluminescent flowers, other times a maw of jagged obsidian teeth dripping dark mist. Cold air funnels from its depths, carrying snatches of unfamiliar music, fragments of whispered voices in languages I don’t recognize. When I step closer, the ground beneath my feet trembles, not in warning, but in anticipation.  

My hands clench at my sides. If I stay, the dream will cradle me, but its edges will never change. If I step forward—into the dark, the unknown—I don’t know if I’ll find wings or a fall.  

Then, a sound—a single note, pure and resonant—emanates from the shifting doorway. It hooks into my ribs and pulls.  

I lift my foot.  

The moment I cross the threshold, the world dissolves into liquid shadow, and I am falling—or flying. Colors streak past in ribbons, galaxies condensing and bursting apart in the span of a blink. There’s no ground, no sky, only the rush of motion, the thrill of surrender.  

And then—  

A new landscape unfolds, vast and wild and untamed. The air tastes of iron and possibility. Above, twin moons cast silver light over ruins older than time. Something inside me cracks open.  

I realize: I have been here before.  

Not in this place, but in this feeling—the vertigo of becoming, the terrifying freedom of the unchosen path.  

And the dream whispers, as dreams do:  

*Remember, you are always standing at the threshold.*
