I am dreaming. …a distant rumble echoes like a hollow drumbeat in the sky. Thunder rolls through the treetops, and the soft golden sunlight filtering through the leaves dims into a pewter gray. The crisp scent of pine suddenly mingles with the metallic tang of ozone, sending a shiver down your spine. As you peer between moss-laden trunks, you notice the wind begin to pick up, rustling leaves and shaking ferns with an unsettling urgency. 

A single raindrop splashes onto your cheek, cold as an icicle. More droplets follow, falling in scattered patterns that quickly transform into heavy sheets of rain. The forest canopy offers little protection, leaves sagging under the torrent, trickles of water tracing erratic pathways down trunk and branch. Each drop hits the ground with a resonant splash, and the forest floor starts to soften, becoming a tapestry of liquid mirror puddles.

Then, an otherworldly flash of lightning illuminates the heart of the storm. For just a moment, it reveals the forest in stark silhouette—every trunk, every leaf, etched in brilliant white against a sudden darkness. Tree branches twist like living arms, and the thunder cracks overhead with such force it feels like the sky is tearing open. The roar reverberates in your chest, awakening a primal mix of awe and apprehension. 

Still, beneath the thunder’s roar, you hear something else—a low, melodic hum that isn’t part of the storm. It seems to be calling you toward a faint, flickering glow deeper in the woodland gloom. Surges of wind bend saplings nearly horizontal, but you somehow keep your footing, drawn forward by that ethereal light.

With every step, your sense of time and place shifts in the dream’s strange logic. The colors around you intensify: the pine needles shimmer emerald green, the raindrops glisten like scattered diamonds, and the very air appears tinged with shifting shades of amethyst and cobalt. By now, the downpour is pounding on your shoulders, drenching you from head to toe, and each new clap of thunder reverberates like the pulse of an ancient drum.

You push aside a low-hanging branch, and there, in a small clearing, stands a magnificent willow tree. Its leaves cascade in pale silver ribbons, even in the overwhelming darkness. Beneath its canopy, where not a single raindrop dares to fall, you spot a soft glow dancing around the trunk—fireflies unlike any you’ve seen, each glowing in a palette of deep violets and turquoises, bobbing to a music only they can hear.

Entranced, you step under the willow’s branches, instantly shielded from the harsh onslaught of the storm. A hush seems to settle—like the eye of the tempest has momentarily found its resting place here. The air feels thicker, laden with the smell of damp earth and something subtly sweet, like blossoms in springtime. Those glowing fireflies drift closer, swirling around you, each leaving a faint, shimmering trail.

A final bolt of lightning splits the sky in the distance, illuminating the forest once again. But inside the circle of the willow, everything remains strangely calm, as if time itself has taken a deep breath. The hush in that hidden sanctuary wraps around you gently, comforting despite the raging world outside. 

And in that surreal moment, you realize you can almost hear the heartbeat of the storm. It thrums through your feet, pulses in your chest, vibrates in the branches. You see the power of nature unleashed, yet feel utterly protected within the willow’s embrace. It is a dream of contrasts—ferocious and peaceful, terrifying and tranquil, all at once.

Then you blink—and in a heartbeat, the dream shifts. You stand, drenched, in the glowing heart of the storm, firefly lights fading into the shadows. The world grows quiet, the air still. You inhale the damp, electric scent of rain-kissed leaves, your mind swirling as the dream lingers, drawing you deeper into its vivid, otherworldly tapestry.
