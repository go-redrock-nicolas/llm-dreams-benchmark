I am dreaming. I float through a silvery mist that parts to reveal an ancient library stretching impossibly in all directions. Towering bookshelves spiral upward beyond sight, their wooden frames carved with symbols that seem to rearrange when I'm not looking directly at them. The air smells of vanilla and distant thunderstorms.

I discover I can fly between the shelves, my body weightless and luminous. As I soar higher, I notice each book contains a memory—my memory—but viewed from outside myself. In one, I watch myself dismissing a compliment about a presentation I spent weeks preparing. In another, I obsess over the single criticism in a sea of praise.

The library begins to shift, books rearranging themselves. A massive crystal scale materializes in the central atrium, one side laden with dark, heavy volumes labeled "Failures" and "Mistakes." The other side holds fewer books, bound in light, titled "Accomplishments" and "Strengths," yet these gleam with inner light.

A librarian with features that constantly shift between people who've supported me throughout my life approaches. Without speaking, they hand me a golden pen that pulses with warmth. I understand instinctively—I can rewrite these books, balance this scale.

As I touch the pen to the first volume, words flow through me, not erasing the memories but recontextualizing them. My perspective shifts. The library trembles, shelves rearranging as the scale begins to balance.

The mist returns, now infused with points of light like stars, and I realize each represents a moment of potential self-compassion waiting to be embraced when I awaken.
