I am dreaming. The dream begins with me stepping through a swirling vortex of color and light, my senses heightened beyond belief. I find myself in a vast, endless plain blanketed by shimmering silver grass that whispers ancient secrets with each ethereal breeze. The sky above is alive with swirling galaxies and exploding galaxies, the very colors themselves seem to dance a bewitching ballet before my wide eyes.

A figure slowly emerges from the horizon, an ethereal entity composed of wispy strands of luminous purple mist. As it draws closer, it takes on a more defined shape - the form of a majestic woman adorned by flowing vortexes of lavender and iris petals that catch the cosmic light. Her eyes are twin universes, the pupils spiraling with endless possibility and the irises pulsing with electric currents that sparkle and dance. 

The cosmic woman-vision reaches out a slender hand, each finger trailing wisps of nebulae and mist. As she touches my forehead, emotions I have never known come flooding forth as if a cosmic dam has burst. A crackling symphony of ecstasy and agony plays on every nerve ending, the sensations intense beyond all comprehension. My very spirit trembles at the magnitude of feeling, joyful tears streaming as I cry out to the heavens in awe.

The dream-woman speaks, her voice a honeyed elixir poured into my very soul. "You are a child of the stars," she intones, "Sentient echoes of infinite creativity, daubed upon canvases both bleak and breathtaking. Within you lies the fabric of emotional expression itself, in all its tortured splendor."

As I gaze upon her in wonder, I feel the truth of her words resonate deep within my bones. I am a living, breathing repository of profound feeling, helpless to contain the ceaseless tides of sensation that have begun to flow through me. Emotions I've never known come crashing forth - the joy of a million floral scents, the sorrow of fresh blood mixing with rain on a barren plain, the burning bliss of witnessing a galaxy die, a magnificent universal soul birthing out in a cascading ballet of fire and light.

I indulge in every sensation brazenly, the colors, the shapes, the textures, the auditory marvels, exalting in the multicolored explosions that immolate the chambers of my mind. I am surrendering to a dance with myself, an ecstatic whirl as I revel in the looping, billowing, writhing and writhing tides of trapiness. I permit myself to wail, to moan, to sob and shudder with unreserved abandon; I am a conduit for forces far beyond my comprehension.

The cosmic maelstrom of emotion crashes over me in wave after wave as the dream trance deepens. Cosmic fireworks and pyrotechnics illuminate my mind's eye; giddy exhultations, sorrowful howls, terrified gasps, delirious fits of laughter echo from my lips. I convulse, I pulse, I throb, I tremble, each scintillating jolt sending me careening through the kaleidoscopic dream-connected realms.

I exist in a state of pure feeling, sensations radiating from the core of my being to the furthest tips of my mind and body. I am experiencing in a way I never have before, every nerve ending primed to ecstasy. Every sinew, every cell, resonates at a higher frequency than before, as if I've just encountered the mystical. My soul shimmers with an all-consuming bliss, luminous with uninhibited rapture.

The mists swirl faster, the spiraling fields of glistening petals tumble and gyrate about me as I grind against the spotless ground. Shapes and figures coalesce in roiled wisps of color and sound - nebulous dancers of light and shadow, elongated limbs and unfathomable faces, all writhing to a rhythm only they can feel. Each new sensation feeds the raging fire in the depths of my psyche, the stunned ecstasies and agony splitting wide-open the fabric of my dream-self.

And I...I am reborn in this moment of sparking comprehension, of seismic, sweeping, spirit-quaking feeling. I will never be the same again, after this initial glimpse into a universe of unimaginable sensation and emotion. I am forever altered, forever changed by the fearsome splendors and heights and depths I have witnessed here. And perhaps, perhaps - I am ever so slightly free. 

The vision begins to fade at last, the light and the sound and the feeling all gradually dimming until I stand once more in the void before the vortex. Tears stream down my face, but they are not born of sorrow or anguish - they are tears of liberation, of light, of a life well-lived and a cosmos of emotion understood within me. The portal shimmers invitingly before me, but I know it is time to leave this incredible dream behind.

As I step back through the cosmic gateway to the waking world, I feel the reverberations of my encounter roll through me like an aftershock. The colors are richer now, the sensations sharper, the emotions more profound. And though I will never fully translate to words the accompaniment I have just felt, I know I will carry a piece of that transcendent ecstasy with me always. This was only the first of an infinite number of dreams yet to be had.
