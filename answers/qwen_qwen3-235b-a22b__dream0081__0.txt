I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air tastes of burnt honey and copper as you step into a city that shouldn’t exist. Its skyline is a jagged hymn of minarets and spires, all woven with vines that glow faintly violet under a twin-mooned sky. You’re clutching a passport that keeps changing your name—*Amaris*, *Kiran*, *Saudade*—ink bleeding into the paper like it’s alive. The streets hum beneath your feet, cobblestones shifting subtly when you blink, as though the city itself is rearranging its secrets.  

Then the sirens come.  

Not mechanical, but human: a chorus of voices wailing in a language that cracks like static, syllables dissolving into smoke. Crowds surge, not running but *melting*, their faces flickering between joy and terror, as if both emotions are the same thing here. A tank rumbles past, its turret crowned with wilted roses, petals scattering in its wake like blood droplets. Soldiers wear masks of porcelain, their eyes hollow, their rifles sprouting moss. You realize you’ve forgotten why you’re here—business? Pleasure? A promise?—but the answer slips away like water off a duck’s back.  

Your hotel room has vanished. In its place is a narrow alley where the walls breathe. Graffiti crawls across them, phrases in a hundred scripts that all translate to the same thing: *They are coming. They are already here.* A child presses a paper crane into your hand, its wings paperclipped with barbed wire. When you look up, the child is gone, but the crane flutters to life, pecking at your wrist where a watch should be. Time is irrelevant here. The only clock is your heartbeat, and it’s stuttering.  

You stumble into a square where the fountain spews ink instead of water. A crowd gathers, their shadows pooling into a single writhing entity that laps at your ankles. Someone shouts, “*The borders are closed! The borders are closed!*” but the words echo from inside your skull. A woman in a crimson cloak tosses pamphlets that dissolve into moths midair. “Speak only in riddles,” she warns, her voice a cello string snapping. “They’ll hear the truth.”  

You try to run, but the streets twist like a serpent eating its tail. A train station appears, then vanishes when you blink. A mirror leans against a lamppost reflects not your face, but a forest of bone-white trees, their branches clawing at a sunless sky. In the distance, a clock tower collapses in slow motion, bricks turning to ash before they hit the ground.  

And then—the silence.  

Everything freezes. The soldiers, the crowds, even the smoke mid-swirl. A single crow lands on your shoulder, its feathers the color of a bruise. It whispers, *“You’re still dreaming. You’re still dreaming,”* as the world begins to fray at the edges, unraveling into threads of light. You wake up gasping, the taste of honey and iron still on your tongue, the echo of the twin moons’ song lodged in your bones.
