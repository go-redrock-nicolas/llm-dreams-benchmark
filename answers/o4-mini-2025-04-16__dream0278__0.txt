I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You stand at the lip of a vast, echoing cavern whose walls pulse with living color—emerald ribbons of light twisting around veins of obsidian stone. Beneath you swirls a river of molten silver, and high above, a colossal moon drifts sideways across a violet sky. At the cavern’s center, balanced on a column of flickering flame, hovers an orb of liquid gold that seems to hum with promise.

In this moment of temptation, you feel a sudden, powerful impulse to make a decision that could be rewarding but carries significant risk. Your heart drums so loudly that each beat reverberates along your ribs like a tribal drum. Tiny motes of phosphorescent dust rise from the cavern floor, dancing like will-o’-the-wisps around your ankles, as if urging you forward. The air tastes of honey and ozone, sharp and heady—every inhalation quickens your senses.

You press one foot onto a narrow bridge of crystalline glass that spans the molten river, and immediately the bridge trembles under your weight. A tingle shoots up your spine: cross, and you will grasp the golden orb, unlocking some secret might or eternal clarity; hesitate, and the glass may shatter, dropping you into the silver torrent below. Around you, the cavern’s heartbeat picks up pace. The flame column flickers wildly, casting your elongated shadow onto the walls; you can almost see the shape of the destiny that awaits you on the other side.

Gathering every ounce of courage, you lift your other foot. The bridge cracks faintly. For a single, suspended instant, time slows: you sense the future branching into two paths—one of triumph, the other of oblivion. Then, with a gust of warm wind and the faint chiming of distant bells, you step fully onto the glass. Instead of splintering, it shines brighter, supporting you. The molten river below quiets to a gentle lap. Inch by trembling inch, you approach the flaming pillar, eyes fixed on the orb. When your fingers close around it, the world erupts in a kaleidoscope of color and light, and you feel a rush of knowledge, of power, of something forever changed.

And then—you awaken, heart still racing, with the lingering warmth of gold seared into your palm and the memory of that impossible decision echoing in your mind.
