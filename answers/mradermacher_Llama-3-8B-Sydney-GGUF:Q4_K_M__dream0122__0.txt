I am dreaming. I find myself as the sole mediator between two ancient civilizations on the brink of war.  Knowing millions of lives depend on my diplomatic skills, I start to explore this dream world and its inhabitants.

As I wander through this strange land, I see many fascinating sights: towering temples, sparkling lakes, lush forests, and rocky mountains.  I hear many intriguing sounds: melodious chants, soothing streams, chirping birds, and howling winds.  I smell many aromatic scents: incense, flowers, herbs, and cooking spices.  I taste many delicious flavors: fresh fruits, savory meats, rich desserts, and spicy sauces.

I soon encounter some of the local people who greet me with curiosity and caution.  They tell me about their clans, their cultures, their beliefs, and their disputes.  They show me their weapons, their tools, their artifacts, and their artwork.

I also meet some of the foreign visitors who come to this land for trade, tourism, or adventure.  They tell me about their nations, their economies, their technologies, and their lifestyles.  They show me their goods, their gadgets, their inventions, and their entertainments.

I then realize that these two groups of people represent two different civilizations: one based on spirituality and harmony (represented by the locals) and another based on power and competition (represented by the foreigners). 

I decide to use my knowledge of psychology, communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution to bridge this gap between them.  I propose several ideas such as joint projects, exchange programs, cultural festivals, etc. that can benefit both sides without sacrificing their unique identities.

However, some of the locals don't trust me because I'm not one of them.  Some of the foreigners don't like me because I'm not like them.  But most of them eventually agree to give this process a chance.

As time goes by, we start to see positive changes happening around us: reduced tensions, increased cooperation, shared learning opportunities, etc.  We also begin to form personal bonds with each other: friendship, respect, admiration, even love.

Just when everything seems perfect, something terrible happens that threatens to destroy all our hard work: an unexpected natural disaster or foreign invasion or internal rebellion or unknown force.

Now I must make the hardest decision of my life: sacrifice myself for the greater good or save myself for future possibilities?
