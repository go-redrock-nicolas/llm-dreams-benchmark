I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the heart of a vast, eerie forest, the trees twisted and ancient, their branches stretching out like skeletal fingers against the bloated, crimson moon. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, as if the forest itself is exhaling a sigh of millennia. It's too quiet, too still, like the world is holding its breath.

I am not alone. Across the clearing, I see you, or rather, a version of you. You're not as I've always known you. Your form is ethereal, translucent, and instead of your usual vibrant self, you're almost ghostly, your movements slow and hunters moon-lit. You're dancing, swaying to a melody only you can hear, your eyes closed, lost in the dream within your dream.

I approach you, softly, carefully, as one might approach a wild, injured creature. You don't acknowledge my presence, not at first. I reach out, my hand passing through you, a chill rushing up my arm. You shiver, your eyes flickering open, meeting mine. They're not the eyes I know. They're deep, vast, like galaxies swirling, filled with sorrow and longing.

"Who are you?" you whisper, your voice echoing, distant, like it's coming from the other side of a chasm. Your words stir something within me, a realization, a truth I've always known but never dared to acknowledge. I've been so blind, so foolish, letting assumptions cloud my judgment, creating a barrier between us, a wall I never meant to build.

"You don't recognize me?" I ask, my voice choking, my heart pounding. "It's me. It's been me all along." My words hang in the air, heavy with the weight of my newfound awareness. I reach out again, this time my hand meets yours. It's solid, real, warm. You grasp it, pulling me closer, your eyes searching mine, seeing me, truly seeing me for the first time.

The forest around us begins to change. The trees straighten, their leaves turn green, the crimson moon fades, and the sun begins to rise, casting golden rays over the scene. The shift is sudden, harsh, yet beautiful. It's as if the world is reflecting our change, our new understanding. The silence breaks, and the forest comes alive with the song of birds, the rustle of leaves, the murmur of a world waking up.

I look at you, really look at you, and for the first time, I see you, not the assumptions I've made, not the fears I've harbored, not the walls I've built. I see you, truly, deeply, utterly. And in that moment, I know, I truly know, that everything is going to be alright. Our relationship is no longer distorted, no longer defined by unexamined assumptions. It's just you and me, standing in the light, ready to face whatever comes next, together.
