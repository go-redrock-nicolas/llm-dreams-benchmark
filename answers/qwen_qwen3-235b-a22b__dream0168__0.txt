I am dreaming.  

The air hums with static, a metallic tang like blood on the tongue. I stand in a control room stitched together from fragments of forgotten places—a cathedral’s vaulted ceiling arched above, its stained glass shattered into jagged shards that glow crimson with the light of distant fires. Below, the floor is a chessboard of cracked asphalt and marble, shifting uneasily as if the earth itself debates which reality to claim. Monitors line the walls, their screens flickering with fractured images: a city drowning in its own smoke, a coastline curling into a monstrous wave, a suspension bridge unraveling like a frayed rope.  

My hands hover over a console that shouldn’t exist—a mosaic of rotary phones, touchscreens smeared with phantom fingerprints, and levers carved from bone. Voices scream through the headpiece clamped to my skull, a cacophony of accents and languages, some human, others… not. *“The subway tunnels are melting!”* wails a child’s voice, high and glassy. *“The river’s on fire and it’s singing!”* A helicopter pilot’s transmission dissolves into a burst of static that smells like ozone.  

I bark orders, but the words die in my throat. Radios short-circuit with showers of sparks. Maps dissolve into ink blots. A clock on the wall ticks backward, then forward, then *screams*. Somewhere, a siren wails in a minor key, warping into a funeral dirge. I grab a flashlight and sprint into the chaos, though my legs move like they’re submerged in tar.  

Outside, the world is a fever-dream. Skyscrapers lean like drunkards, their windows weeping molten glass. The sky is a kaleidoscope of wrongness—a blood-orange sun pinned beneath a crescent moon, both spinning too fast. Crowds surge through the streets, faceless and flickering, their bodies phasing in and out of solidity. A woman clutches a radio that morphs into a live serpent; it hisses coordinates that burn my ears.  

I split myself into three. One me directs firefighters to a collapsing library where books are fleeing the flames, fluttering like charred moths. Another me pilots a rescue boat through a tsunami that carries the drowned and singing dead. The third me negotiates with a sentient earthquake, its voice a subsonic growl rumbling through the bones of a bridge. *“Let them cross,”* I beg the tremor, *“and I’ll let you have my ribs for kindling.”*  

But the systems fail. Always. A satellite feed glitches, replaying a loop of a smiling anchorman whose face slowly melts. My walkie-talkie broadcasts a lullaby in a language that doesn’t exist. The bridge collapses anyway, swallowing a school bus whole. The wave crests higher, its foamy fingers plucking helicopters from the air like gnats.  

And still, I run. Through acid rain that etches hieroglyphs into my skin. Through alleys where shadows have mass and hunger. A clockwork raven alights on my shoulder, whispering probabilities in a dead mathematician’s voice. *“Seventy-eight percent survival if you sacrifice the child. Twelve percent if you save the archive.”* My hands tremble. The child’s eyes are full of galaxies; the archive hums with the memories of extinct stars.  

I choose.  

And the dream fractures.  

I wake up gasping, the taste of ash and responsibility sharp on my tongue. But in the lingering haze, I wonder: Was I the hero, the villain, or just the wound through which the world bled its chaos? The clock on my wall ticks normally now. But its hands are stained red.
