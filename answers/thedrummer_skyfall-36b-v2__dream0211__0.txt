I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a massive, cold auditorium filled with thousands of people. The giant venue, which smells of rich wood and leather, is an ancient, gilded lecture hall that echoes with the mixed chatter of a restless crowd. You are perched on the edge of a grand stage adorned with extravagant velvet drapes and blinding stage lights which bathe the space in an otherworldly glow. The air is thick with anticipation as whispers and murmurs fill the auditorium, a buzzing hive of curiosity and tension.

You look down at the strange object in your hands, a sleek black capsule, its surface cool to the touch and oddly smooth, like nothing you've ever seen before. Your heart races with a potent cocktail of excitement and trepidation. In this capsule lies the secret to what you create, a mind-blowing innovation so radical, so groundbreaking, that going public with it promises to shake humanity to its very core.

As soon as you step to the podium, the room falls silent, the weight of a thousand expectant gazes bearing down upon you. President Sunny Shekhawat, renowned biochemist, founder of the groundbreaking Shekhawat-Lin Biomedical Complex, inventor of the revolutionary Anthelan bio-enhanced nutri-injection, is here to make her groundbreaking announcement. 

You are about to have your say. You take a deep breath, center yourself, and begin.

"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues. My friends. Today I bring before you a creation born of the very depths of our scientific understanding, forged in the crucible of human ingenuity and daring. It is both a triumph and a test. It challenges us to confront our assumptions, to question our beliefs, and to dare to imagine a future beyond our wildest dreams."

As you speak, a massive screen duplicates behind you, flashing symbols, images, and snapshots that lead the audience through your remarkable story—from the humble beginnings of your vision to the remarkable breakthroughs that followed. 

The soft clicks and beeps of thousands of cameras being aimed at you echo throughout the hall, chasing the sound of your rhythmic breathing. A globe rotates on the screen, and as you explain the significance of what you have created, it whirls faster and faster. Projected against the globe's twilight are the skeletons of insects, the layers of a human, comparisons of bioterrain overlays. 

"It's a slimy, wily, rhythmical revolution. A thousand-tone shrimp and a kids' funky clubbo! We found the scores to our generation's scoreboard—enhanced hyper-machines allow for a free funk tune for the body. "

You lift the capsule to show it to the crowd. "This tiny vial contains a solution that, if introduced to the human genome, has the power to weaken the force of our negative thoughts and fearful emotions and boost the inborn signals of our positive thoughts and emotions. By re seeming the brain and nervous system, we can forge a new age of inner peace and outsized prosperity. We are not only making level 1 hyper dreams possible, we are making them the customary zone for all."

A jostling murmurs starts dimly in the back of the auditorium, rising to a clamor in seconds as people start booing. They leap to their feet, shaking fists and waving placards on which the safety questions they've long seen coming are angrily scrawled. 'How safe is safe enough?', 'Let's not forget the thousands who died in early trials', 'Exploitation of the vulnerable', 'Keeping science in good hands', 'What about over-adaptation?'. You see the sea of people turning hostile and unsure.

"It's a funky performance, a grocery bagging, a disorganizing pool of craving fingers and charming dreams. And it's all transforming the body right now."

The murmurs fan out across the auditorium and you feel the panic rising in your throat. Embracing it, fueling it, you swing the capsule at them and make your plea.

"The dreams aren't done. Break into freedom and beauty, into found fabrications and high heart break, pounding a new standard—here is the true inside story and the beginning of a long-ago tomorrow."

People's eyes are alight with rage. They throw things at you, empty wrappers, program guides, chunks of rotten fruit. I take it in my hands, bring it close to my face, and drink. Suddenly I feel the absence of company, the ache of custom. I long for the genius of my peers; trophied joy and paralytic glee.

But even with the defiant disequilibrium of it all, I I know there is nothing for it but to lie back and enjoy it. All of it.

The controversy, the excitement, this madcap weird world of a dream.
