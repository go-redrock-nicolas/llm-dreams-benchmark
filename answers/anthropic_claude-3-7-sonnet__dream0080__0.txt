I am dreaming. The notification comes on a Tuesday afternoon as I'm watering the orchids on my windowsill—these delicate blooms I've somehow kept alive through sheer determination. My phone vibrates against the countertop, and the email subject line reads: "Regarding Your Space Mission Application: FINAL DECISION."

For twenty-seven years, I've charted my life toward this singular purpose. Since age eight, when I first pointed a telescope at Jupiter and watched its moons dance, I've been consumed by the stars. Through undergraduate astrophysics, the punishing gauntlet of NASA's selection process, the thousands of flight hours, the centrifuge training that made my vision tunnel to a pinprick while my body screamed in protest—all of it aimed toward this moment.

The rejection feels physical—like all my bones have simultaneously hollowed. "Medical disqualification. Irreversible retinal degradation." Words that translate to: you will never leave Earth's atmosphere. The condition had been developing silently for years, and now my vision, the very thing that first drew me to the stars, betrays me.

I walk through the subsequent days like a ghost. The apartment I chose specifically for its rooftop access becomes unbearable. The telescope I've upgraded meticulously over decades sits shrouded under a black cloth. I can't bear to look up anymore.

Then one rain-soaked evening, lost in the city, I stumble into a community center seeking shelter. A young girl is there, maybe eleven, struggling with math homework, muttering formulas about velocity and trajectory. Her frustration reminds me of myself.

"Want some help?" I hear myself asking.

Her eyes widen when I explain orbital mechanics using salt and pepper shakers on the table.

"You know a lot about space," she says.

"I was going to be an astronaut," I reply, the words less painful than expected.

"Was?"

The question hangs between us like a challenge.

Three months later, I'm standing before twenty children in the planetarium I've helped build in the abandoned warehouse behind the community center. The darkness hides my occasional tears as I guide these young explorers through nebulae and galaxies. My hands may never grip the controls of a spacecraft, but these children—with their unfiltered wonder and boundless potential—they might.

I wake with wet cheeks but a lightness in my chest I haven't felt in months. The dream of touching the stars has transformed into something different but no less magnificent: becoming the gravity that helps launch others beyond my reach.
