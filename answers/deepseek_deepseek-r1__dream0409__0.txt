I am dreaming. In the shimmering haze of the dream, I stand in a cathedral of ice, its crystalline arches refracting light into rainbows that dance like liquid fire across the walls. My breath swirls in the frigid air, each exhale a ghostly confession. Before me lies a mirror, not of glass, but of black water, still and depthless. When I touch its surface, ripples reveal a version of myself I do not recognize—a shadow-cloaked figure with hands stained indigo, planting seeds that sprout not into life, but into thorns that weep silver tears.

A chorus of whispers rises from the frozen ground, voices of every soul I’ve ever cherished, reciting my own words back to me: *“Integrity is the compass,”* they chide, their tones both tender and accusatory. The thornvines snake around my ankles, pulling me toward the mirror, where my shadow-self now grips a lantern filled with swirling starlight. “This is the cost,” it rasps, offering the light. “Burn the thorns, and yourself with them, or let the garden rot.”

I hesitate, torn, until the mirror’s surface erupts. A flock of paper cranes bursts forth, each folded from pages of my old journals—vows, ideals, promises inked in fading scarlet. They carry the lantern skyward, igniting a constellation that melts the ice cathedral into a warm, primal dusk. The thorns wither to dust, and my shadow dissolves into the earth, murmuring, *”To choose is to lose. To act is to bleed.”* 

I wake with the taste of starlight on my tongue, and thorns blooming in my chest, delicate and unresolved.
