I am dreaming. …find yourself reaching beyond mere language, drawing instead on sensation, color, and music to approximate what it felt like…

Imagine this:

I’m standing in the midst of an endless prairie beneath a sky that churns with electric pinks, turquoises, and molten gold. The clouds swirl in arcs, shimmering like schools of fish just under the surface of a sunlit sea. Every breath I take is infused with the scent of sweetgrass and warm soil, and from somewhere unseen, cello music drifts softly on the breeze. There is no visible orchestra—only a single note stretching across the sky, harmonizing with the thunderous heartbeat in my chest.

I begin to walk through the tall, whispering grasses that brush against my ankles like soft whispers of old friends. With each step, I sense the earth pulsing beneath me. It’s as though each blade has an inner glow, and when one sways, it casts a ripple of colored light through the field—lavender here, pale gold there. Breathing in the swirling prism of hues feels like tasting liquid sunshine.

And then, with a strange, silent whoosh—like the hush of an inhale—the entire scene transforms. I find myself in a cavernous space made entirely of white crystal that gleams under the faintest flicker of unseen stars. My voice resonates off the crystalline walls, blending with the distant echo of dripping water, each droplet chiming like a bell. The air is colder here, bracing and tinged with the metallic tang of frost. But somehow, even in the chill, I feel an enveloping warmth, as though each crystal face is pulsing with some kind of caretaker presence.

I think I see flickers at the edges of my vision—the faint outlines of figures perched high on a ledge of quartz. They don’t move, but I sense they are breathing. In the hush, they emit tiny motes of light that float into the chamber and dance around me like miniature galaxies. I try to call out to them, but every word slips through my hands like a wisp of smoke. My breath forms a shimmering cloud in the cold air, and when it settles, the dream shifts again, as abruptly as flipping the page of a book.

Suddenly, I am on a narrow path suspended miles above a glittering ocean. A bridge of pearls and mother-of-pearl arcs through the night sky. Below me, the water glows a radiant teal, and it washes gently against the shore—though I can tell the shore is unreachable without crossing the bridge. Each step on the bridge resonates with a crystalline chime, and I feel almost weightless, as if gravity can’t quite decide whether to hold me close or let me drift. There’s a taste in the air—like salted honey—and an undercurrent of melodic humming that seems to come from within the ocean itself.

My heart pounds with a surreal exhilaration, the kind that feels like every star in the universe winking awake inside your bone marrow. My thoughts blur into shapes and emotions as I try to gather these sensations into words. It’s too grand, too colorful, too alive to be contained by speech. I want to show you the pastel swirl of the sky, let you feel the hum of the living land, give you a taste of the silken twilight. But my words feel like small, flat coins compared to the boundless realm I’m in.

So I do the only thing I can: I breathe in every strand of light and color, carrying it into my heart. My veins spark with the dream’s brilliance, and I hope that by looking into my eyes, you might glimpse a fraction of this enchanting domain. I whisper these descriptions, yet they still seem to flutter just out of reach—like trying to catch a moonbeam with trembling fingers. And all I can do is hope that the vivid echoes that remain inspire a dream within you as well.
