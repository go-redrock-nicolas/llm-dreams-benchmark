I am dreaming. 

The first civilization is known as the Dreamers. They live in a world where dreams are real and reality is a nightmare they can't wake up from. They communicate through telepathy and manipulation of energy fields. Their most important resource is an emotional force field that protects them from external threats. They believe in unity, peace, and freedom. 

The second civilization is known as the Awakeners. They live in a world where reality is real and dreams are just illusions they can't escape from. They communicate through technology and manipulation of matter fields. Their most important resource is an armor made of nanobots that enhances their strength, speed, agility, and resilience. They believe in power, domination, and control. 

You must find a way to resolve the conflict between them before they destroy each other and themselves. You have limited time and resources. Can you end this nightmare once and for all?
