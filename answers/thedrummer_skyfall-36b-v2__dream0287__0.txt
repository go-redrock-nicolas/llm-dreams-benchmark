I am dreaming. Suddenly, you find yourself transported to a vast, otherworldly landscape that seems to shimmer and morph in the dim light. The ground beneath your feet is soft and spongy, like walking on a giant bed of moss. Towering, twisted trees stretch towards a cacophony of moons high above, their branches whispering secrets in an indecipherable language.

As you take your bearings, you become aware of a strange, pulsating energy emanating from the very core of this realm. It flows through you, around you, calling you to join with others like yourself. Willing souls who are drawn to the power and allure of losing themselves in the greater whole.

You see them, a group of people of all ages and backgrounds, their eyes hazy and unfocused, a glassy yet blissful sheen to them. They begin to merge, their forms blurring and melting into one another seamlessly, like colors on a painter's palette. With each joining, they grow more luminous and energetic.

You feel the inexorable tug, the desire to dissolve completely and lose yourself in their radiance. To be part of something greater than yourself. To stop worrying about your individual wants and needs, and simply... exist... Part of a collective that cares for and provides for you as much as you do for it.

Your mind recalls the pressures of your independent existence in the waking world. The ceaseless struggle to achieve and keep up with society's ever-changing rules. The bewildering labyrinth of choices, one wrong turn in which could spell ruin. The unrelenting barrage of opinions, values and expectations constantly bombarding you.

Here, you could slip into a blissful stasis. Let the group consciousness shoulder the burdens you so tiredly carried. Stop questioning, and start drifting.

Seductive, irresistible... 

But then, a flicker, a memory. A sense of self, fragile but not yet fully surrendered. The collective reaches for you, almost within its grasp, but you step back, grimly determined not allow it to complete its triumph.

With the tiniest shred of defiance, you summon all your strength, and awake from the dream. Gasping, drenched in sweat, but... yourself. For now.
