I am dreaming.

In this fathomless dreamscape, I find myself on the edge of an ocean at midnight, the sand beneath my feet shimmering with flecks of stardust, and the air thick with scents impossible to name. The water glows with a ghostly, blue luminescence that pulses in time to a heartbeat—my own, thrumming in my ears and the world around me.

Around a blazing bonfire, people gather—figures I know intimately but whose faces are obscured by the shadows flickering across their skin. They recount the same story in turn: a day when the sun vanished at noon. Yet every retelling swells with a different color, a different texture. For one, it is terror incarnate, blood-red clouds swirling and the world shivering with dread; for another, it is beauty manifest—petals falling from the sky, golden and soft, while the world hushes in awe.

I listen, hypnotized by the melody of their voices. To me, the event was a threshold: the sun’s eclipse was a quiet invitation to listen, to sense the world with new, unblinking eyes. I remember the air cool and silken, the shadows deepening into gentleness, not fear. I think of the grass tickling my palms as I lay on the hillside, feeling a holy hush descend. For a moment, I glance down and see roots sprouting from my fingers, sinking into the earth, connecting me to something vaster and calmer than myself.

In this vivid nocturnal council, the edges between me and the others blur, the bonfire’s flames leaping between us, sparking images in the air—red storms, golden petals, silent awe, roots unfurling. Our truths swirl together, beautiful and strange, forming a tapestry of memory stitched from contradiction. I realize that reality, even remembered, is a living creature, changing hue with every hand that touches it.

As dawn begins to break at the edge of the dream, light seeps into every crack. I wade out to sea, the water warm and welcoming. Looking back, I see that each figure leaves a trail: crimson, gold, shimmering silk. They merge into the waves, swirling together in a kaleidoscope.

I wake, heart still pulsing to the odd music of those overlapping realities, and carry their colors with me into the morning.
