I am dreaming. You're scheduled to perform a challenging task in front of an audience of experts. Minutes before you begin, you realize you might not be fully prepared, and your heart begins to race. Suddenly, the stage lights dim, and you hear a soft melody playing in the background. A feeling of calm washes over you as you slowly make your way to the center of the stage. As you place your hands on the grand piano, you close your eyes and take a deep breath, letting the music fill you up.

You begin to play, and the notes flow effortlessly from your fingers, creating a beautiful symphony that fills the room. The audience, mesmerized by your performance, leans forward in their seats, their eyes fixed on you. The music grows more intense, and you feel as though you are playing with the entire universe. Karate-chopping sounds echo through the auditorium, announcing your mastery of the performance.

As you finish your piece, the applause is deafening. You open your eyes to see the audience on their feet, giving you a standing ovation. The experts in the front row exchange glances, their faces filled with awe. One of them, an older man with a distinguished gray beard, approaches the stage. He shakes your hand and congratulates you on your performance, saying it was the best he'd ever seen.

You wake up, feeling invigorated and ready to take on whatever challenges the day might bring.
