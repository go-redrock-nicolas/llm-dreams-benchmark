I am dreaming. In the foreground of my dream, I stand, bathed in an ethereal softbox of twilight, upon a stage that stretches out as vast and empty as a frozen lake under a midnight sky. The air is cool, charged with the scent of distant rain and the hum of impending lightning. The auditorium before me is a monolithic, silent beast, its tiers of commodious seating shrouded in shadows, the balconies swallowed by the gloom. A Single Spotlight - a sentinel of brilliance, dances nervously between the velvet curtains, waiting to pounce and capture my every movement.

Suddenly, the silence cracks, and a}}\,\ Sasha - his voice, resounding like a tolling bell, echoing through the silent amphitheater. "Bravo!" He shouts, "Encore, encore! Magnifique! C'est un virtuose!" The applause follows, thunderous, a cascading domino effect of hundreds of hands crashing together, each clap resonating like gunshots in the cavernous hall.

I feel a strange sensation, a whirlwind of emotions stirring within me. My heart hammers against my ribs, not from the exhilaration of a performance well done, but from an overwhelming sensation of being exposed. Every inch of my skin prickles, feels raw, open, as if I'm standing completely naked before a sea of strangers. I am at once exhilarated and terrified, a sensation not unlike teetering on the edge of a cliff, the wind whipping around me, the abyss yawning below.

A surge of memories flood my mind. I'm a child again, standing before an audience of one - my mother. Her eyes, cold and disapproving, bore into me as I clumsily recite a nursery rhyme. "You're embarrassing yourself," she hisses, her voice slicing through my recollection like a razor. Then I'm a teenager, cringing as my classmates snicker at my eager attempts to join their conversations. I'm an adult, wincing as a colleague dismisses my idea in a meeting, reduction to mere, "Oh, that's interesting" - their tone saying the complete opposite.

Each memory is a needle, pricking, prodding, wholesome praise on my skin. My throat tightens, and I find it hard to breathe, the air thick with the fog of my discomfort. The applauseears, but it's muted now, as if I'm hearing it through water, through marshmallow. The spotlight flickers, pulsates, its beam wavering, threatening to snap off completely. Darkness looms, ready to devour me, and I yearn for it, crave it, anything to extinguish the exposed, raw feeling that rages within me.

As the applause fades, the spotlight dims, the stage begins to dissolve. I fall, tumbling into the enveloping embrace of oblivion. But as darkness claims me, I feel a spark, a tiny, defiant flame within me. It flickers, it struggles, but it refuses to die. It's my truth - my own acknowledgment of my worth, untainted by others' opinions. And it's in this realization that my dream ends, leaving me with a sense of quiet determination, a promise to myself to nurture this flame, to let it grow brighter, to chase away the darkness and the shadows of my past.
