I am dreaming. ---

**Dream Journal: The Whispering Eclipse**  

I find myself standing at the edge of an obsidian river, its surface so still it mirrors not just the sky, but something *else*—a sky beyond the sky, a deeper black freckled with unfamiliar constellations. The air hums with the scent of petrichor and burnt sugar, a paradox of freshness and decay. My bare feet sink into the silt, which pulses faintly, as though the ground itself breathes.  

Ahead, the horizon splits open—not like dawn, but like a seam unraveling. From it spills an *eclipse*, but not the muted disk I know. This one drips liquid shadow, its edges fraying into countless filaments that stretch toward me like hungry roots. As it nears, I realize it’s not an eclipse at all, but a pupil. The world is an eye, and I’m floating in its gaze.  

The river begins to rise. Not in waves, but in *strands*, each thread of water knitting itself into shapes—fragile, glowing things like jellyfish made of vowels, their bellies pulsing with half-remembered songs. One brushes my wrist, and suddenly I’m *remembering*:  

—The taste of my mother’s voice before I knew language.  
—The exact weight of a childhood shadow stretching behind me on the first day of school.  
—The way laughter looks when no one’s watching—golden, shapeless, giddy.  

The pupil dilates. A voice, neither loud nor soft, slips into my mind: *"You thought these were small things."*  

Then—collapse. The river shatters like glass, but instead of falling, the pieces *flutter upward*, becoming a storm of blue-winged moths. They swirl into the void where the eclipse was, leaving behind only the scent of wet paper and a single word humming in my teeth: *"Notice."*  

I wake with a gasp, fingers clutched around a crumpled sheet, the dream already fading—but my skin tingles where the water touched me, and for the first time in years, the air smells *alive*.

Would you like to step deeper into the dream? Perhaps follow the moths? Or stay by the river to see what other memories rise?
