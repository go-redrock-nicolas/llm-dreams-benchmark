I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You sit at your desk, but the office is wrong—familiar yet distorted, like a memory half-remembered. The walls stretch too high, their surfaces shimmering with the iridescence of oil on water. Clocks hang everywhere, but their hands spin backward, ticking in arrhythmic gasps. Your boss looms nearby, though you can’t quite see their face; it’s a smudge of shifting light, a sunspot that burns if you stare too long. They hand you a folder that feels heavier than a cinderblock, its pages alive with ink that writhes like black worms. “Finish this by sundown,” they say, their voice echoing as if spoken through a tunnel. “Or you’ll never leave this building.”  

The project is impossible. It’s not words or numbers but *souls*—you’re meant to bind them into a report, a quarterly forecast of human longing. The pages demand you harvest memories: your first heartbreak, the scent of rain on pavement, the way your grandmother’s hands trembled as she folded napkins. You protest, but your throat fills with moths. The deadline isn’t metaphorical. Outside the window, the sun plummets toward the horizon, dragging the sky down with it like a curtain.  

You scramble to work, but your keyboard types itself—gibberish that glows crimson before dissolving. The floor beneath you softens, becoming quicksand made of old receipts and forgotten passwords. Colleagues drift past, their bodies melting into smoke, their voices whispers of static. One leans down, their face a mosaic of cracked porcelain, and murmurs, “The deadline is a lie. The real task is to *remember* you’re dreaming.”  

Suddenly, you’re not in the office anymore. You stand in a labyrinth of filing cabinets that tower like skyscrapers, their drawers spilling over with galaxies. Each folder contains a life—not yours, but ones that could have been. You grasp one, and it bursts into a flock of origami cranes that scream as they fly. The sun is lower now, its light pooling on the ground like blood.  

A clockwork owl perches on a nearby cabinet, its gears grinding. “Tick-tock,” it chimes, but the words unravel into a melody—a lullaby your mother once sang. You realize the deadline isn’t about finishing; it’s about *letting go*. The project was never real. The office, the boss, the labyrinth—they’re all fragments of your own fear, the weight of expectations you’ve swallowed whole.  

You tear the folder in half. The scream that erupts is your own, raw and unshackled. The world fractures. The sun freezes mid-fall. For a heartbeat, everything is still—a held breath. Then the shards of the dream rain down, glittering like shattered mirrors, each reflecting a version of you that chose to wake up earlier, or stay asleep forever.  

You wake up gasping, the taste of ink and nostalgia on your tongue. The clock on your wall ticks forward, relentless and kind.
