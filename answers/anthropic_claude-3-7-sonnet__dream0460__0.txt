I am dreaming. I find myself on a rain-slicked city street at twilight, the neon signs reflecting in puddles like electric watercolors. The crowd parts around an elderly man who has collapsed, his weathered face tight with pain, groceries scattered across the wet pavement. While most hurry past with averted eyes, a young woman in a paint-spattered jacket kneels beside him.

Time seems to slow as I watch her. She doesn't just help—she transforms the moment. She shields him from rain with her own jacket, speaks to him with such gentle attention that his face relaxes. When no ambulance can come quickly, she hails a taxi, gathering his belongings and helping him inside with extraordinary care. What strikes me isn't just her actions, but the complete absence of hesitation—as if kindness were as natural as breathing.

Suddenly I'm following them, drawn by an inexplicable force. At the hospital, she stays. Not for minutes, but hours. She contacts his family, brings him tea, reads to him from magazines in the waiting room. She expects nothing, refuses his grandson's awkward offers of payment with a warm smile.

Something shifts within me. The woman's compassion feels like a mirror reflecting my own potential. I approach her in the hospital corridor, my voice unexpectedly emotional as I tell her how moved I am by her kindness.

"Anyone would do the same," she says, but we both know this isn't true.

The dream transitions—I'm now walking through my neighborhood, seeing opportunities for compassion I've always overlooked: the isolated elderly neighbor, the struggling young family, the teenager sitting alone day after day. With each person I stop for, each moment of connection, colors around me grow more vivid, sounds more clear.

The dream deepens, revealing that small kindnesses are not small at all—they're the very threads that weave humanity together across our differences and distances.

I wake with tears on my face and a profound clarity: I've been given a glimpse of who I could become.
