I am dreaming. I am walking through a bustling city street, my mind wandering as I take in the sights and sounds around me. Suddenly, I spot my best friend from college, Emily, across the street. She's standing outside a trendy coffee shop, dressed in a stylish outfit I've never seen her wear before. As I approach her, she turns to face me, and I'm taken aback by the vacant expression on her face. Her usually bright eyes are dull and lifeless, and her smile doesn't reach her eyes. 

"Emily, hey!" I say cheerfully, hoping to break through whatever is troubling her. But she just nods slowly and shifts her weight awkwardly from one foot to the other. "Are you okay? You seem...distant." 

Emily takes a deep breath before speaking. "I've been so tired lately," she whispers, her voice barely above a whisper. "It's like I can't escape this fog." 

"Have you seen a doctor?" I ask, my heart starting to race. Emily shakes her head. "I just thought it was stress," she says, rubbing her forehead. "But now I'm not so sure." 

We stand there in silence for a moment, both of us lost in our own thoughts. I don't know what to do or how to help her. As I watch Emily slowly slip away from me, I realize that something is very wrong. I wake up with a jolt, my heart pounding out of my chest.
