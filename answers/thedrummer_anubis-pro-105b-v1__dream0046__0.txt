I am dreaming. *kesyo*: There I was, standing in the middle of a bustling city street, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and swarming pedestrians. The sun beat down relentlessly overhead, casting long shadows across the concrete expanse. But amidst the vibrant colors and cacophony of city life, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was terribly wrong.

My heart pounded in my chest, each beat echoing through my entire body. Beads of sweat trickled down my face, the salty tang mingling with the exhaust fumes and cacophony of car horns. Every fibre of my being screamed that a disaster was looming, yet I was the only one who seemed to sense the impending doom.

As I frantically scanned the scenery, my eyes zeroed in on the warning signs that others seemed to be ignoring. The sky had an eerie yellow tinge, as if thick smog had settled over the city, obscuring the blue heavens. The air felt electric, charged with an invisible tension that made my skin prickle.

How could the people around me not see it? How could they just keep walking and talking and going about their daily lives as if nothing was wrong? The pastel colors of the billboards seemed sickeningly bright, mocking me with their cheeriness. Did no one else sense the encroaching menace?

My mind reeled as I turned in a circle, desperately trying to pinpoint the exact source of this looming desperation. The pavement beneath my feet felt spongy, as if it were about to liquefy and swallow me up. With each breath, the humid air clung to my lungs, the taste bitter with the promise of disaster.

And then I saw it. Two blocks to my right, a slight quiver, a thin thread of smoke rising into the sky. The frown deepened on my forehead. It was small now, barely perceptible, but I knew what it represented. What it portended.

My instincts screamed at me to act, to do something - anything - to sound the alarm and protect my fellow humans from this approaching pillar of fire and fury. But the hesitation on my tongue tied me to the spot, unable to muster the voice to speak. The weight of inaction crashed down on me, suffocating me with each passing second.

I was trapped in this nightmare, powerless to change the course of events as they unfolded before my eyes. The chaos was closing in around me, a noose of inevitable destruction that no amount of courage or wits could hope to unravel. I could only stand there, paralyzed with fear, and watch the disaster begin to unfurl in all its terrifying glory.

The ground shook violently beneath my feet, wrenching me out of my helpless reverie. It was here. The day of reckoning had raced upon us, and we were all teetering on the precipice, with no thread to cling to, no escape from the abyss. I only hoped that there would be an after.
