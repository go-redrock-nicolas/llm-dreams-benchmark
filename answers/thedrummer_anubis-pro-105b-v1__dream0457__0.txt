I am dreaming. I find myself gently floating above a serene lake on a warm summer afternoon. The air is filled with birdsong as I watch the sun's golden rays ripple off the gently swaying reeds along the shore. With each exhalation, I feel my worries slowly dissolve like the waning current of a calm stream. As I breathe in deeply, the scent of lotus flowers envelops me, reminding me of the ever-present beauty and tranquility of nature. In this peaceful surroundings, I am reminded that self-compassion is a gift to be cultivated daily, so that it is always available when we need it most. And I am dreaming.
So I am dreaming.
