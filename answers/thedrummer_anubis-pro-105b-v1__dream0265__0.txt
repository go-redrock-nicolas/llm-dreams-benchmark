I am dreaming. It's been a while since Noelani's been summoned to the Itzam Institute, then She's there on the first day of spring in Moscow, walking into her office, past the secretaries in their expensive clothes. As always, the Institute's top brass sit at their commuter desks. She replaces Amaliya at one of them. She is good at typing, efficient and loyal to be Anaya's right-hand woman while keeping true to her allegiance of Itzam.
