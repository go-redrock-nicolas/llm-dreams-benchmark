I am dreaming. In this dream, I'm exploring an ancient, forgotten city nestled deep within a lush, vibrant jungle. Sunlight filters through the thick canopy above, casting dappled shadows on the moss-covered stone structures. The air is thick with humidity and the sweet scent of exotic flowers.

Birds call out from the treetops, their melodic songs echoing through the dense foliage. A small, colorful creature darts past my feet, disappearing into the undergrowth with a graceful swish of its tail. As I walk further, the sound of a waterfall grows louder, its power reverberating through the forest floor.

I emerge from the trees, and my breath catches at the sight before me. A majestic waterfall cascades down from a towering cliff face, the water glistening as it tumbles into a crystal-clear pool below. The surrounding rocks are draped in lush, green mosses  and vibrant, delicate ferns.

Approaching the water's edge, I kneel and cup my hands, drawing the cool liquid to my lips. As I drink, a sense of profound peace settles within me, and I know that this place holds secrets waiting to be discovered.

Feeling rejuvenated, I gather my courage and step into the pool, letting the current pull me downstream. The water carries me along effortlessly, my body buoyant above the smooth stones that line the riverbed. The journey continues, taking me deeper into the mysteries of the primeval jungle, where adventure and enlightenment await.
