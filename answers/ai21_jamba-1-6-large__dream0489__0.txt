I am dreaming. Visions surge like ocean waves, each one carrying me deeper into the kaleidoscope of imagination. I float weightlessly in a realm where the laws of physics have dissolved, replaced by a cosmic ballet of colors and shapes.
I find myself standing on the edge of a vast canyon. The chasm stretches infinitely before me, its walls shimmering in hues of emerald and sapphire, alive with an otherworldly glow. The air hums with anticipation, as if the very atmosphere is whispering secrets meant only for me.
Beneath my feet, the ground begins to crumble, dissolving into golden sand that swirls upward, coalescing into towering figures. They move gracefully, their forms shifting between human and beast, dancing to a rhythm I can feel in my bones but cannot hear.
The canyon opens into a boundless sky, dotted with stars that pulse like heartbeats. Each one sings a note, creating a celestial symphony that vibrates through my very essence. I reach out to touch a star, and it bursts into a shower of stardust, painting the dreamscape in glittering light.
Suddenly, I am falling, spiraling downward into a sea of liquid light. The sensation isn’t frightening but exhilarating, as if I’m being cradled by the universe itself. Beneath the surface, ancient runes swirl around me, glowing with an inner fire. They speak in riddles, their meanings just out of reach yet strangely comforting.
As I drift in this boundless expanse, I realize the certainty I once clung to has vanished, replaced by a profound sense of peace. I am one with the not-knowing, dancing in the mystery, and it is enough.
