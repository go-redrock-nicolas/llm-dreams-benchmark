I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds...**  

The air hums with electricity—thousands of faces blur into a sea of shadows under the blinding stage lights. My heartbeat pulses in my throat, a drumroll before the defining moment of my life. The world watches. I can *feel* their collective breath held in suspense.  

Then—**I see it.**  

A loose wire, snaking unseen beneath the podium. A flicker of sparks. My blood turns to ice. No one else notices—the crowd murmurs with anticipation, the cameras zoom closer, but I alone catch the glint of danger.  

**Time warps.**  

The seconds stretch like taffy. My mind races—do I stop the demonstration? Risk humiliation? Or barrel forward, gambling with disaster? A metallic tang coats my tongue as adrenaline floods my veins. The wire *hisses*, a serpent coiled in the shadows.  

But then… something *shifts*.  

A whisper curls into my ear—a voice not my own, yet eerily familiar. *"This is your moment. Dance with disaster or transcend it."*  

A wild grin tugs at my lips. Maybe the wire *is* the show. Maybe the world doesn’t want flawless perfection—they want **magic**.  

I step forward—not away from the danger, but *into* it. The spotlight burns white-hot. I raise my hands… and the stage erupts—not in flames, but in **lightning**.  

The audience gasps. The live feed glitches. And for one heartbeat, I am not a performer—I am a **storm**.  

Then—awakening. Sheets tangled, heart pounding. The echo of applause still ringing in my ears.  

*Was it a dream… or a premonition?*
