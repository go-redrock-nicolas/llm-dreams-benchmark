I am dreaming. The operating theater gleams with an otherworldly luminescence, more brilliant than any real hospital could be. I stand before a patient draped in azure sheets that shimmer like water when I move. Somehow, I know this person—not their name or face, but I feel a profound connection as if their survival is intertwined with my own existence.

The scalpel in my hand catches the light, impossibly sharp and weightless. Though I've never held such an instrument before, it feels like an extension of my fingers. The room around me pulses with expectation; monitors display brain patterns in colors that shouldn't exist, swirling hypnotically across screens.

As I bring the blade toward the patient's exposed skull, I notice my hands aren't trembling as they should be. Instead, they move with a surgeon's confidence while my mind races with panic. The contradiction feels natural in this dreamspace.

The first incision releases not blood but tiny points of light that float upward like fireflies. The assembled medical team—faces blurred and constantly shifting—nod encouragingly. Their whispers echo with strange acoustics, as if traveling through water.

Suddenly, the patient's thoughts become visible—memories and emotions materialize above the operating table as translucent bubbles. I instinctively know I must navigate through these fragile spheres to reach the shadowy mass lurking deep within the folds of the brain.

The deeper I venture into this impossible surgery, the more the walls of the operating room dissolve, revealing a cosmos of neural pathways stretching into infinity. I am simultaneously terrified and exhilarated, a novice performing the impossible while guided by some inexplicable intuition that transcends my conscious limitations.
