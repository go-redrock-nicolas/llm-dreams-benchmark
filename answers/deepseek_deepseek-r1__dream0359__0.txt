I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a vast, shimmering garden under a twilight sky streaked with amethyst and gold. The air hums with the scent of night-blooming flowers, their petals glowing faintly as if lit from within. Ahead, a figure kneels by a fountain, their silhouette fragile and hunched, shoulders trembling with silent tears. Their hands clutch a locket that pulses with a faint, desperate light. 

As I approach, the ground beneath me shifts—a mosaic of broken glass and velvet, each step a choice between softness and violence. I feel a cold, liquid awareness in my veins: *This person’s sorrow is a thread I could pull to unravel them, to weave into a ladder for myself.* The locket’s light flickers in time with their heartbeat. One whispered half-truth, a feigned moment of empathy, and the locket—their hidden vulnerability—could be mine to wield. 

But then the garden itself reacts. Vines coil around my ankles, thornless but insistent, as murmurs rise from the soil in languages I almost recognize. The fountain’s water stills, reflecting not my face, but a thousand fractured versions of the weeping figure—*shattered by others like you*, the garden seems to whisper. A single magnolia blossom drifts down, brushing my cheek, and for an instant, I feel the weight of every wound I’ve ever concealed. 

The moment splits. To exploit or protect? The dream holds its breath, the sky darkening to a deep, starless indigo. My hand hovers. What grows in the space between power and mercy? The answer is not here—not yet—but the dream lingers, waiting.
