I am dreaming.

I stand in the center of a vast, mist-shrouded chamber, so wide that the arched ceiling vanishes into the clouded dusk above me. The air hums with silent tension, lit only by wavering pools of phosphorescent blue light that flicker along the floor like liquid moonlight.

Before me squats an ancient machine—an artifact forged from dusky metals and translucent stones that swirl with a faint inner glow. Gears as delicate as spiderwebs twine with pulsing sinews of unknown purpose; there are levers carved with indecipherable runes and shimmering crystals embedded deep within its heart, rotating slowly as if tracing the orbits of invisible planets. The machine towers over me, both majestic and menacing, its presence humming with dormant power.

Beyond it, I hear the distant roar of pursuing shadows—shapes moving at the edge of perception, pulling the darkness ever closer.

My only chance is the machine.

I circle it, studying, hands trembling but curious as I brush dust off a series of interlocking dials. One dial is warm to the touch, almost breathing. I press it: from deep within, something sighs as if awakening after a thousand-year slumber. Tiny lights ignite along the grooves, pulsing in rhythm like a heartbeat.

There—etched along the base, I spot pictograms: a bird in flight, an unfurling fern, a spiral comet. Memories hint at a sequence. I carefully align the dials—bird, fern, comet. The machine rattles, gears spinning, steam hissing through hidden vents, filling the chamber with the scent of rain and old copper.

A panel slides open, revealing a curious instrument: a crystal rod crisscrossed with golden veins. Instinct guides me. I insert the rod into a hollow socket in the center. The whole machine shudders, casting spectral shadows against the walls. With a thunderous click, a hidden mechanism triggers—a portal stirs behind the machine, a whirlpool of mist and starlight spiraling wide.

The darkness shrieks, reaching for me, but the machine shields me in a cocoon of blue fire and launches me forward, weightless, through the pulsing gate. All at once, the sound, the fear, the metallic scent—vanish. I float through a corridor of stars, the world left behind, my heart pounding with awe and impossible escape.

I awaken, the feeling of ancient gears and blue light lingering around me, as if the dream might return whenever I close my eyes again.
