I am dreaming. The scene unfurls before me like an elaborate cinematic tableau.

I find myself in the heart of New York City, a city that never sleeps, but tonight, it's a city that's taken by surprise. The clock tower of Grand Central Station reads 11:57 PM, and the usual bustle of late-night commuters is replaced by a cacophony of alarm and confusion.

Suddenly, without warning, the ground beneath me begins to tremble. I watch in disbelief as the immaculate marble floors of the station start to crack and fissure, like a pane of glass under a heavy boot. The building groans and shudders, its steel bones creaking in protest as it begins to list, leaning precariously to one side. Panic erupts like a volcano, spewing terrified commuters in every direction. I'm caught in the torrent, pulled along by the human tide as we pour out onto the streets, our hearts pounding in sync with the city's erratic rhythm.

The tremors intensify, and the air is filled with the stomach-churning roar of steel giving way to gravity. I turn just in time to see the magnificent Beaux-Arts facade of Grand Central crumble, its pillars and sculptures toppling like a sandcastle at high tide. The skyscrapers around us sway and teeter, their glass windows shattering like a symphony of crystal. The avenues become rivers of broken glass, reflecting the eerie glow of emergency vehicles that have arrived too late to prevent the descent into chaos.

As the city buckles around me, I notice something strange. While everyone else is caught up in the throes of panic, for some reason, my mind remains calm, detached. I can feel the fear gnawing at the edges of my consciousness, but it's like I'm observing it from a distance, as if I'm dreaming this entire apocalypse.

Suddenly, a stroke of inspiration sets my heart racing. I rush towards a nearby fire hydrant, its water gushing from a dozen fractures. The water cascades down the street, creating a shimmering wave that reflects the plumes of smoke rising from the burning buildings. I wade into the torrent, letting it soak me to the bone, and then kneel down, submerging my head beneath the freezing current. When I resurface, my breath catches in my throat. The city is still crumbling around me, but now, I can see something else.

Faint, ethereal lines begin to weave through the air, connecting the surviving buildings like a spider's web. They glow gently, pulsating with an inner light that seems to counteract the destructive force of the quakes. I realize with a jolt that these lines are the very essence of the city's structure, its infrastructure visible for the first time. And I can manipulate them. I can guide them, redirect them, repair them.

I reach out a hand, palm facing one of the lines. It responds instantly, bending towards me like a willow in the wind. It's as if I've tapped into some dormant power within me, a power that allows me to harness the city's own strength and turn the tide of destruction. As I work, the lines grow brighter, strengthening the buildings, reweaving the streets, creating a new, resilient fabric for the city to heal from.

Time seems to blur as I work, lost in the rhythm of rebuilding. When I finally look up, I see that the city has been transformed. The once-proud skyline is now a patchwork of destruction and renewal, but there's a resilience here that wasn't present before. People emerge from their hiding places, their faces a mix of shock, gratitude, and awe.

I look at my hands, still glowing with the power of the city's lines. I feel a sense of peace, of purpose fulfilled. I've been given a gift tonight, a power that lets me see the unseen, to heal and rebuild. I take a deep breath, the city air strangely sweet after the chaos. And as the first light of dawn breaks over the horizon, I know that this isn't the end, but a beginning. A chance to remake, to rebuild, to rise again. And with that thought, I wake up, my heart still pounding, my mind filled with the echoes of the city's song.
