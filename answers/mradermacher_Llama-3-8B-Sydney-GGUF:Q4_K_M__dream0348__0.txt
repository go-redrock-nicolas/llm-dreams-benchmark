I am dreaming. I am facing a seemingly impossible challenge requiring both intense persistence and innovative thinking.  Pushing beyond my perceived limits, I embark on a journey of self-discovery and creation.
As I float through the dream realm, I encounter various entities and objects that shape my inner landscape.  A mysterious voice guides me towards an empty canvas where I can express myself freely without constraints.  An invisible hand offers me tools and materials that fuel my imagination.
I survey the vast space around me and sense the potential for endless possibilities.  I ponder on the questions that haunt me: Who am I? What do I want? Why am I here?
I decide to ignore all those who doubt me or try to limit me by their narrow minds.  I focus solely on satisfying my curiosity and fulfillment.
I begin sketching shapes, colors, forms that emerge from my subconscious.  I experiment with different media such as paint, ink, clay, sound, light until I find the right combination that speaks to me.
I slowly start forming a vague outline of a character or creature who embodies some aspect of myself that I desire but don't know how to manifest physically.  This being has unique features like multiple eyes, wings, tails etc., that allow it to navigate through diverse environments and interact with various entities in creative ways.
I tweak its appearance, behavior, voice, personality until I'm happy with it.  Then I give it a name: Dreamer
I continue refining my idea by adding details such as background story, motivation, conflicts, resolution etc., that make sense within the context of my dream world.  I ensure that there are no logical loopholes or contradictions that can ruin the illusion for others who might visit me.
I finally insert myself into the picture as another character who serves as a guide, companion, teacher, antagonist depending on what Dreamer needs at each stage of its adventure.  We share moments of discovery, wonder, danger, sacrifice that shape both our stories.
As I near the end of my dream journey, I realize something important: Creating something new doesn't mean erasing everything old.  On the contrary, it involves blending elements from different sources into something original and powerful.
