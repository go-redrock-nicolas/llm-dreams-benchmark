I am dreaming. …I feel the cool hum of the office lights, the tapping of distant keyboards—a dizzying, surreal rhythm. My desk seems to float gently above the gray carpet, drifting in and out of focus as if the edges of reality are being painted in watercolor.

My boss, a tall figure with eyes that shimmer and glow like electric marbles, stands in the doorway. Her voice echoes and dissolves in the air, instructing me to complete a project thicker than a phone book, filigreed with diagrams and unreadable glyphs, by the end of the day. The clock on the wall is melting Dali-style—numbers oozing and pooling onto the floor, making time itself unreliable and slippery.

I sit and open my laptop, but instead of a keyboard, there’s a patch of soft, living moss. Each touch sprouts a different kind of flower: some bloom with lines of code, others unfurl into crisp pie charts or fluttering sheets of text. I frantically tap, trying to coax a report into existence, but the words fly off the screen as a flock of luminous, paper-winged birds circling my head. They chirp in voices that sound like colleagues discussing deadlines, their chatter blending into the mechanical whir of printers and the scent of fresh coffee that grows ever sweeter, threatening to drown me in warm syrup.

Suddenly, my chair begins to slowly sink, as if swallowed by quicksand. I try to stand, but the floor turns to shimmering glass, reflecting infinite versions of myself—some confidently typing, some weeping, others laughing maniacally at the absurdity of it all. My boss peers over the cubicle wall, her arms elongating, stretching across the ceiling like vines, handing me a glowing pen. “This is the only tool you’ll need,” she says, her voice echoing like distant thunder.

I clutch the pen, and as soon as its tip touches the paper, colors explode outward like a sunrise: purples and golds, turquoise and dazzling emerald. The report writes itself, every word flawless and perfect. My boss applauds, her hands multiplying, the entire office rising into applause as confetti rains down, made of shimmering spreadsheets and tiny, giggling deadlines. The impossible task dissolves into laughter and light, an absurd performance that leaves me floating, weightless, in the warm glow of accomplishment—until a sudden shrill alarm peals, and the dream melts away, like dew in daylight.
