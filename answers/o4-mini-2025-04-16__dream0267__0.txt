I am dreaming. I drift through a twilight meadow where the grass gleams like molten silver under a pale, rising moon. In the distance, a lone figure staggers across the field, clutching their side as scarlet blooms open on the ground with each step. I feel the soft press of dew beneath my bare feet as I raise my hand, and tendrils of gentle wind swirl into a vortex around them. A single gust knocks the figure off balance—then another—and they collapse among the grass, petals staining white blades red.   

The air tastes of iron and damp earth, but no tremor of guilt shivers through me. Instead, a curious calm has settled in my chest, as though a cold crystal has taken root where compassion ought to grow. I kneel at the fallen person’s side and brush a strand of hair from their face. The wound pulses faintly, yet my heart remains as still as the mirrored pond behind me. There is only quiet acceptance—no recoil, no remorse—just the hush of moonlight and the distant cry of night-birds.  

Rising, I turn to the pond. In its glassy depths, I search for my reflection, expecting to see horror or shame, but instead find the outline of someone untouched by regret. My eyes hold a story of distance: a soul folded inward, observing but never stirred. There is power here, I realize—a freedom in feeling nothing for another’s pain. And yet, as I watch silver ripples fade, I wonder if this absence of sorrow is relief or emptiness, a door swung wide between me and every other beating heart.
