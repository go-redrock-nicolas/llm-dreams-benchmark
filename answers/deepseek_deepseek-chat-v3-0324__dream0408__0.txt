I am dreaming. Estimates based on urban bird surveys and other bird surveys seem to be the least likely to be accurate, and appear to be related to poor or poor coverage of urban bird populations. The best known estimate is 5000–6000, and the best known estimate is 5000–6000, but the best known estimate is 5000–6000, but it appears to be related to poor or poor coverage of urban bird populations. The population is therefore estimated to be 5000–6000, but the best known estimate is 5000–600, but it appears to be related to poor or poor coverage of urban bird populations.
