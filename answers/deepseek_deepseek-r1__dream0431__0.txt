I am dreaming. In the dream, the sky is a twilight bruise, violet and indigo bleeding into a horizon that stretches endlessly. I find myself standing at the edge of a glass lake, its surface so still it mirrors the heavens like polished obsidian. My feet are bare, and the ground beneath me shifts with each step—soft moss one moment, cold pebbles the next, as though the earth itself is uncertain of its form. 

Ahead, a figure emerges from the mist, blurred at first, then sharpening into someone familiar—a face I’ve carried like a stone in my chest for years. Their eyes are downcast, their hands cupped around something small and glowing, pulsing faintly like a trapped star. As I approach, the air hums with the weight of unsaid words, thick as honey. The resentment I’ve nursed takes shape: twisted vines coil around my ankles, thorns biting into skin, rooting me to the spot.

But then the figure opens their hands. The glowing light rises, weaving into the vines, and they begin to unravel, each thorn dissolving into shimmering dust. The lake stirs, ripples spreading like sighs, and in its reflection, I see moments I’d forgotten: laughter tangled in arguments, fragility masked as anger, a dozen small fractures that built the wall between us. The light expands, wrapping around us both, and I feel the ache in my chest crack open—not with pain, but release. 

When I wake, my pillow is damp, and the room feels lighter, as though the dream has carried away a weight I no longer need to hold.
