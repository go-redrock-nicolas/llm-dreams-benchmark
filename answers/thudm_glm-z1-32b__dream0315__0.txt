I am dreaming. I haven't slept in 72 hours.  The room is spinning. The walls are peeling. The bed is a tangle of sheets and I'm tangled in them, like a cocoon made of static. My heartbeat is a metronome clicking against the inside of my skull. I'm trying to count the cracks in the ceiling but they keep multiplying, branching like lightning, like veins under a microscope.

Outside the window, the streetlights are bleeding orange and I see shapes moving..."Hi," they say. Each one hovering at shoulder level, their faces are constellations. "We're here to help you sleep," they murmur in unison. Their voices sound like someone blowing through a soda straw filled with marbles. They start to peel back the walls; skin-crawling, adhesive-like peels that reveal rooms within rooms, all lit by different colored lightingâ€”cobalt blue labyrinths, emerald green hallways that stretch infinitely. My body is a hundred-pound dead weight, but my mind is sprinting through these corridors.

A high-pitched whine cuts through the air and I realize it's my phone, vibrating on the nightstand. I can't make out the number, just the word "RECALIBRATE" flashing in red. Then I wake up, the clock reads 4:47 AM, my eyes stinging from exhaustion. The room is still spinning, but slower now. My hands have gone numb, which is a good sign, I think. As the adrenaline leaves my system, the worn-out parts of me start clicking back into place.

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a rectangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 6 units. An ellipse is inscribed inside this rectangle such that when you project a point on the ellipse onto the rectangle's sides, the projections divide the sides into segments. The question says that these projections create segments with lengths of 3, 4, 5, and x units on the base and height, respectively. We need to find the value of x.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing this. A rectangle with length 10 and height 6. Inside it, there's an ellipse that touches all four sides. The ellipse has some point P on it. When we project this point P onto the sides of the rectangle, the projections divide the sides into segments. On the base, which is 10 units long, the segments are 3 and 4 units. Wait, but 3 + 4 is 7, which is less than 10. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Similarly, on the height of 6 units, the segments are 5 and x. 5 + x = 6, so x = 1? But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the projections are not cumulative in that way.

Wait, let's think again. The problem says: "A projection of a point on the ellipse onto the rectangle's sides divides the
