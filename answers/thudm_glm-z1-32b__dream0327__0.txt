I am dreaming. The environment around me is a shimmering, liquid landscape that shifts and flows like mercury under a microscope.  My field of vision is fractured into prismatic panels, each showing a different memory of my lover from our past: her laughter echoing in an abandoned cathedral, fingers brushing mine over steaming mugs, her shadow stretching long across dawn-washed sidewalks.  A silver thread connects each fragment, glowing brighter where our bond felt unbreakable.  I reach out, and my hand phases through the display like a ghost, but as I withdraw, a crimson droplet falls where skin should have touched—staining the temple's marble column in our shared memory.  The connection thread snaps at the droplet's point of impact.  The cathedral screen flickers, now showing her holding back tears beside a packed moving van while I stand frozen at the curb, convinced she would vanish if I spoke her name aloud.  I try to grab the memory, but it disintegrates into stardust, leaving only the van's rear door closing with an echoing *thud*.  My perspective tilts sideways—vividly seeing how my pride built walls instead of bridges, assuming she'd never leave when the signs had beenbraszen and blue like emergency warning lights.  My hands now leave physical imprints on this liquid landscape, warping it into jagged geometries that mirror my heart's structure.  The silver thread pulses with new circuitry-like patterns, suggesting paths we could've taken if our assumptions were conductive instead of insulating.  A neon pointer hovers, its tip splitting into branching possibilities: one where I confessed doubts in that van's shadow, another where we danced in the cathedral ruins under aurora-colored rain.  The current follows every line, illuminating alternate timelines like subway tunnels spinning through a kaleidoscope.  I wake with the taste of copper and the memory of a choice that still hums behind my eyelids like a tuned circuit waiting for a signal.
