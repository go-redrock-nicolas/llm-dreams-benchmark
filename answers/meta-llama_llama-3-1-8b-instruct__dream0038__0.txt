I am dreaming. The sensation of lying on my back, surrounded by the softness of my bed, still lingers in my mind as I gradually come undone from the dream world. In this vivid, visceral nightmare, I find myself standing at the helm of a startup, with a venture that had once been my brainchild, a shining star in the tech world. LunaSpark, my brainchild, a revolutionary platform that fused artificial intelligence with sustainability, had been on the cusp of a major breakthrough. We had assembled a team of top talent, investors eager to back our vision, and a growing user base enthusiastic about our innovative approach to revolutionize the way the world interacts with technology and the planet.

But it's all crashing down within the timeframe of the dream. Inside the cutting-edge startup hub where I stand, the air is thick with anxiety. My staff, my friends, my colleagues, and I are huddled in an emergency meeting room, trying to make sense of the disaster unfolding before us. Our core investor, Mr. Nakamura, sits beside me, yielding no discernible enthusiasm despite his substantial commitment to the project. Investors who had been awaiting a sound progress report now walk in one by one, their faces conveyed a mix of disappointment and disbelief. News has just surfaced concerning a rival tech giant, Cygnus Innovations, releasing a platform eerily similar to ours—it seems they have successfully cracked our secret sauce—the powerful AI core that captains LunaSpark.

Fear suffocates me, transforming each fleeting moment into an eternity. Panicked contemplations circle around the table as we consider the situation. The launch window we had tirelessly worked towards is now shoved off ominously by weeks, maybe even months, due to the stark resemblance to Cygnus’s product. Key partners, once so eager to integrate our groundbreaking technology into their setups, are now very interested talk of revoking their commitments. The team rushes around, scrambling for solutions that seemed so formidable just hours before. My mind screams to find a silver bullet to save LunaSpark, weighing the influx of predetermined plans—starting from abandoning ship to fighting back with revamped offerings or purely delaying till the gap is minimized.
