I am dreaming. — float, not with relief or exhilaration, but with a weightless detachment, in a world cast in half-light and smoky edges where emotions once pulsed like neon veins. I am both present and curiously absent—an observer at the edge of a crumbling stage.

Before me, on cracked marble tiles glistening with cold, spilled tears, a figure collapses. Their distress trembles in the very air: cracked sobs, wringing hands, face streaked in streaks of anguish as raw as thunderclouds split by lightning. Their suffering hangs heavy—a stormcloud above a wilting garden.

Yet as I look on, I find nothing stirring inside. No ripple of sympathy, no ache or yearning to reach out. The space where empathy should dwell is a silent, echoing void. My heart, encased in glass, reflects their pain but does not feel it.

Startled by this absence, I study myself, as if gazing into a strange mirror. Around me, the world is painted in shades of gray, sound muffled as though wrapped in velvet. The suffering person's cries pass through me like wind through hollow reeds. There is only observation, clinical and cold: the precision of their pain catalogued, analyzed, but never shared.

I reach out a hand as if to comfort—the gesture automatic, learned from another life—but my fingers pass through their agony as though through a shadow. No connection forms. My hand is left tinged with frost; the emptiness inside me pulses quietly. I remember what it was to care—old, faded photographs of warmth and sorrow—but cannot summon those feelings now.

I turn away, drifting through the dream landscape: deserted playgrounds bathed in blue twilight, empty swings swaying mournfully in a nonexistent breeze, alleys paved in lost memories. The world feels both impossibly distant and unreachably close.

Somewhere behind me, the weeping continues, but it might as well be the hum of wind against glass—meaningless noise I cannot decipher. I glance down and see that my shadow is gone, as if I’ve left the last part of myself behind with the suffering stranger.

Alone in the dream’s deep heart, I wander on, an observer without emotion—a ghost who remembers what it was to feel, yet cannot find the door back to warmth. The world—so beautiful, so haunted—continues its spinning lament without me.
