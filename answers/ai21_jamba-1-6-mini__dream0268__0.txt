I am dreaming. I begin to dream. The setting dissolves into an ancient forest, where ancient oaks stretch their gnarled branches towards a bruised, twilight sky. A gentle breeze carries the melodic whispers of unseen birds, and the air is thick with the earthy scent of damp moss and wildflowers. Fireflies flicker in the dimming light, casting a glow that dances through the underbrush. The forest floor is soft beneath my feet, carpeted with a thick layer of leaves that rustle faintly as I walk. The trees seem to lean in closely, their shadows shifting and swaying as if alive, casting long, wavering arms across the shadowed path. Each step feels like wading through a pool of memories, where time blends and memories resurface like echoes.

But there’s an unsettling quiet, a stillness that raises hairs on the back of my neck. My breath fogs faintly in the cool air, and the distant sound of dripping water echoes softly, like a ticking clock in the deep of night. Suddenly, overhead, there’s a sharp snap of a branch, and the entire forest feels to hold its breath. My heart quickens, the forest growing darker, its shadows deepening into pools of impenetrable blackness. The air around me seems to freeze, and I sense, though I can’t yet see, that something is watching me. My dream now takes a darker turn, and I feel the first tendrils of fear winding tightly around my chest.
