I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the shores of a vast, moonlit lake, surrounded by a gathering of individuals from all corners of the world. The air is alive with the gentle lapping of the water against the shore, and the soft chirping of nocturnal creatures in the nearby woods. The sky above is a tapestry of twinkling stars, shimmering with an otherworldly light.

Before me, a magnificent cedar tree stands tall, its branches stretching towards the heavens like outstretched arms. Its bark is etched with intricate carvings of different languages and symbols, representing the diverse cultures and identities gathered here. Beneath its canopy, a diverse group of individuals has assembled, each with their own unique story to share.

At first, I notice that some voices are loud and boisterous, drowning out the whispers of others. A great speaker, with booming laughter and a commanding presence, dominates the conversation. Their words are laced with authority, and others nod in agreement, but I notice how their eyes glaze over, unwilling to truly listen. The remainder of the group, though eager to contribute, hesitate to speak up, their voices trembling in the shadows.

Recognizing the imbalance, I take a step forward, and as I do, the ground beneath my feet begins to surface, revealing a glowing pathway that illuminates the way forward. The pathway unwinds through the assembly, spreading across the clearing, and following its gentle curve, I make my way to the base of the cedar tree. I place my hands upon its trunk, and as I do, the carvings begin to glow with a soft, ethereal light.

The tree's energy resonates deep within me, and I feel a surge of creativity and compassion flow through my being. I close my eyes, and as I inhale the scents of the forest, I sense the presence of the silent voices, their whispers rising to the surface.

"Gently," I say, "let the voices be heard. Allow the space for each perspective to shine with its own brilliance." With these words, the cedar tree's branches begin to rustle, gently rustling loose the leaves, like softly whispering breaths. The branches reach out, tangling with the strong speaker, holding them firmly yet kindly, as if reminding them of the importance of balance.

The boisterous voice begins to quiet, and as it does, a young woman steps forward, her dark hair adorned with intricate flowers, her eyes shining with a radiant light. "Thank you for the space to speak," she says, "I wish to share a story of resilience and hope from my community."

Her voice, rich and melodious, fills the clearing, transporting the assembly to a world beyond their own. The group leans forward, captivated by her words, and as they do, the trees respond, rustling their leaves in rhythm, creating an enchanting cadence that mesmerizes the onlookers.

One by one, others begin to share their stories, each voice a brush stroke of color on the canvas of the conversation. An elderly man with a wispy beard stepped forward, speaking of his struggles and triumphs, his words dripping with wisdom gathered from years of living. A young boy, shyly bursting into the conversation, fills the group with laughter, sharing anecdotes of his experiences and the lessons learned from his adventures. Women of all ages contribute, weaving a rich tapestry of perspectives from various cultures and identities.

As the night wears on, the voices weave together, forming a glorious tapestry, each thread sparkling with its own unique brilliance. The cacophony gives way to harmony, and the gathering transforms into a vibrant celebration of shared understanding and mutual respect.

As I stand beneath the glowing cedar tree, listening to the conversations, I realize that this dream is not unlike the world we strive to create. We hunger for inclusivity, creating a harmonious atmosphere by embracing diversity and offering empathy and compassion to all. When voices are heard, our humanity shines brighter, leaving no one behind or unheard.
