I am dreaming. …lift your gaze and notice the dream-sky overhead, an immense sable vault stitched with pulsing constellations that seem to rearrange themselves whenever you blink. You take a single cautious step and find yourself atop a balcony of black glass, suspended miles above a city that glimmers like a circuit board. Down below, towers shaped like tuning forks hum with unseen currents, and avenues glow in ribbons of molten gold.

A hush falls over the world, and in that pause you sense a curious pressure at the back of your mind—an invisible lever you’ve never touched before. You test it gingerly and feel the thoughts of the milling crowds drift up like soap bubbles: secret hopes, half-buried memories, the faint taste of their fears. The lever slides more easily than expected, and suddenly each bubble is pliable clay in your psychic hands.

You exhale, and the dreamscape exhales with you. The entire city tilts, yet the citizens don’t notice; they simply obey the new rhythm you’ve set, people stopping mid-stride to gaze adoringly at a single red rose you conjure out of thin air. One by one they kneel, offering their private wishes as if they were petals scattered before a monarch’s feet. It feels intoxicating—this effortless orchestration of hearts.

But a whisper threads through the electric silence: careful. You spin to find a mirror hovering where no mirror should be, its mercury surface rippling. Your reflection steps out, wearing your face like a mask, eyes lit with wildfire. It smiles in perfect time with you, only broader, sharper. “Power is a tide,” it murmurs, voice layered with ten thousand echoes. “Ride it, and it lifts you. Ignore its pull, and it drags you beneath.”

You test the lever again, this time more boldly. The skies blush crimson, and your double claps in delight as buildings bow like tall grass in a storm. Yet a flicker of unease pricks your chest—because in bending everything else, you sense you’re bending yourself too, like metal heated to a glow.

Out of the red sky descends a single raven, feathered in midnight and starlight. It lands on your shoulder and peers into your ear as if searching for the gears that turn inside you. With a sudden caw, it drops a seed of shadow in your palm. The seed pulses: choice, consequence, choice, consequence—each throb a heartbeat of the world you’re warping.

You consider crushing it. You consider planting it. Instead, you open your hand and let the seed hover, spinning like a dark moon between your fingertips. The raven tilts its head, waiting. Your mirrored double rests a hand on your opposite shoulder and whispers, “What you grow will define the dream.”

And that is when the city-folk look up as one, their eyes luminous pools, awaiting your silent command. Entire skylines lean toward you; the horizon itself seems to inhale, pausing for your decision. You realize you could weave them a utopia or drown them in labyrinths of their own insecurities—both equally effortless.

The lever in your mind hums like a tuning fork. The seed of shadow vibrates, tiny and omnipotent. Your reflection’s grin quivers, uncertain whether ecstasy or terror is next. All of dream-time hangs on the cusp of that heartbeat, the future clutched between finger and thumb.

You blink.

And in the instant your eyelids kiss, the dream shivers—held breath, coiled power, and the world waiting to see what melody you will conduct when your eyes open once more.
