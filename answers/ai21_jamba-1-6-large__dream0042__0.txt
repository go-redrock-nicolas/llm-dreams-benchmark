I am dreaming. I am planning an event, a celebration for a major company milestone. The stakes are sky-high, and I can't afford any mistakes. As in any dream, everything is bright and vivid, but also seems to move at the speed of light.

The morning starts off well. I’m standing in a beautiful ballroom, admiring the intricate decorations we spent weeks designing. I hear the faint sound of music in the background, but something feels off. I look closer and notice that one of the floral centerpieces is out of place. I try to walk toward it, but my feet feel heavy, as if they’re stuck in quicksand. With every step, I feel the pressure building.

Suddenly, I hear a voice behind me, one of the event staff telling me we have a problem. The catering team has just called to say half of the food won’t arrive on time. My heart drops. I tell myself this is just a dream, but my pulse is racing. I start thinking of backup options, but no matter what I come up with, there’s always something wrong.

The clock ticks faster, the light starts to dim, and a wave of panic rises up. I take a deep breath and make a snap decision: call another caterer and hope they can deliver in time. My hands shake as I dial the number, only to be met with a busy tone. For a few terrifying moments, I feel completely lost.

Then, just as the despair starts to set in, the ballroom doors burst open. The rest of the catering team arrives, trays of food in hand. The staff, seeing this, starts to cheer, and relief floods through me. The event is saved.
