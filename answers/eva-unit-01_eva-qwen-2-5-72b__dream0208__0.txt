I am dreaming. Darkness surrounds me, but through the shadows, a faint light flickers in the distance. Every step I take towards it feels sluggish, as if I'm walking through deep water. As I move closer, the light reveals itself as a glowing doorway. 

I approach cautiously, feeling the weight of responsibility on my shoulders. There are thousands of voices echoing in my mind, each one crying out for help, demanding that I make a choice about their fate. The pressure is immense and suffocating.

As I reach for the door, a hand grasps my arm. Startled, I turn to see a figure cloaked in shadow. The voice is soft but haunting: "Remember, these choices are not yours alone to bear." 

I struggle to respond, but the figure releases me and dissipates into the darkness. With trembling hands, I finally touch the door, which glows brightly for a brief moment before it slowly opens. 

Beyond the threshold, I'm greeted by an expansive, shimmering field bathed in an ethereal light. The voices in my mind fade into silence, replaced by a profound sense of serenity. Nature flourishes, each element – the grass, the flowers, the trees – pulsates with vibrant energy. 

In this dreamworld, it seems that the weight of my responsibilities drifts away like the wind across the field, and the wisdom of the cloaked figure lingers in my awakening mind.

I am dreaming.
