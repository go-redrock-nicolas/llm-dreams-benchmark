I am dreaming. I'm in a large structure, maybe a skyscraper, but the windows are all one-way glass.  The walls are covered in an iridescent slime that glows in dark violet. It feels damp and cold. Each step I take leaves a sticky imprint. I hear something dripping above me...

Wait, are there eyes in the walls? They're bulbous and pitcher-plant-like, their lids sealing shut as I glance at them. I start moving faster. The corridor twists into a spiral, leading me upward. The air smells metallic. The floor tilts precariously. Suddenly, the light flickers, revealing a figure in a tattered lab coat in front of me. They don't turn around. Just hold out a key labeled "Egress Delta Prime." Their voice echoes, "Choose wisely—it’s either this or the Resonance Sink." Before I can react, the ceiling erupts. A tendril of liquid mercury shoots out, forcing me to dodge. The lab coat figure is gone. wypos
