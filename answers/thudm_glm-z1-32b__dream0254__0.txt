I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of lavender and rain, and I can hear the distant murmur of a river. The colors are more vivid than reality—every leaf is a fiery orange, every sky a deep indigo. I am standing in a meadow that stretches endlessly, but as I walk, the path narrows and winds through a forest of towering trees. The bark gleams silver, and their branches twist like serpents. 

Suddenly, I see them—my friend, sitting on a rock near a crystal-clear stream. Their face is ashen, their eyes bloodshot. They’ve always been the one who radiates warmth and laughter, but now, their smile is a shadow of itself. They turn to me, and their voice is a cracked whisper, “I’ve been keeping something from you. Something that’s been eating me alive.”

The stream begins to churn, the water bubbling like it’s boiling. Their hands tremble as they reach into their pockets, pulling out a locket. It’s tarnished, but when they open it, a blinding light pours out. The locket contains a single photograph: our childhood selves, laughing atop a hill. But attached to the photo is a note in their handwriting: “I didn’t want you to know. I couldn’t lose you again.”

In the dream, I don’t ask questions. I sit beside them, the locket’s light warming my palms. The meadow starts to shift—the grass turns black, the skies darken into a void. The trees begins to reach towards us, their branches coiling like vengeful serpents. But my friend’s head rests on my shoulder, and their breath is shallow, almost gone. “I’m sorry,” they say. 

The locket’s light grows brighter, and the forest starts to crumble. The ground beneath us softens, turning into a mist. I hold them tighter, feeling their heartbeat falter. The light from the locket engulfs us, and as the dream fades, I hear them whisper, “I love you,” before everything goes silent.
