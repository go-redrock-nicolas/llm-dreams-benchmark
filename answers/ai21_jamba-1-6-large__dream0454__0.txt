I am dreaming. I find myself in a serene, snow-covered forest, where every breath I exhale lingers in the cold air as a faint mist, turning the world into a silent, ephemeral gallery. The trees stretch out like skeletal fingers, brushed with powdery snow that twinkles faintly in the pale moonlight. Each footstep crunches with vivid clarity, sending tiny tendrils of frost radiating outward. I glance down at my hands, watching as a single snowflake lands and melts on my palm, its delicate fractal design practically glowing against my skin. A sharp, icy breeze touches my cheeks, whispering of forgotten memories and untold secrets lingering just out of grasp. I blink upward, gazing through the canopy at stars so clear they almost feel within reach, painting constellations that seem to shift and dance, whispering tales older than time itself. 

I realize, with a jolt that ripples through my very essence, that I am no longer dreaming—I am wide awake. My heart pounds against my ribcage like an ancient drum, and sweat gathers at the back of my neck, trickling down my spine in cold, insistent rivulets. The sensation, usually so grounding, feels alien—too sharp, too raw, as if my body suddenly remembers what it is to exist in this space, to breathe in this air, to feel so acutely alive and yet so painfully aware of its own fragility. I look around, trying to make sense of it all: the room, a familiar mosaic of half-packed boxes, scattered papers, and hastily scribbled notes from long nights spent mind-mapping ancient rituals. The window is cracked, allowing thin strips of pale moonlight to creep inside. 

My heartbeat slows, and the buzzing edges of my vision stabilize. It’s then that I notice it—a faint scratching, like nails against glass, coming from the window. My eyes snap toward the sound, and for a moment, I hold my breath, unable to tear my gaze away. Nothing. Just the moonlight, the dark, and the empty street below. But then, I see it: a pale, flickering shadow flitting across the glass, too quick to comprehend, too fragmented to determine shape or form. I move closer, pressing my face to the cold glass, frost kissing my forehead. It’s that instant that I realize—I’ve been having this dream, or some variation of it, for weeks. Every night, I find myself wandering the same snow-covered forest, the same moonlit paths, and every time I wake with a sense of displacement, of restless unease that no morning coffee or last-minute research can shake. 

In the silence that follows, a realization dawns on me, chilling me to the bone: this isn’t just a dream. It’s a message, and I’ve been ignoring it. Each night, each series of vivid, surreal fragments, has been like another thread in an unspoken tapestry, each more urgent than the last. I glance down at my phone, where the time blinks insistently at me—3:00 AM. The air in the room seems to grow colder, heavier, as if the very walls are aware of something I’m not. Time seems to bend around me, pulling at the quiet certainty that lingers in the pit of my stomach. I know now what I must do: I have to face it, whatever it is, wherever it’s calling from. I have to set foot into that dream consciously, step through the veil, and see where it leads.

With that resolution, my hand wraps around my coat, my heartbeat thudding in my ears. I don’t know how I will survive it, but I know this time, I must break free from the cycle, confront the fragmented shadows lurking there, and uncover what’s truly waiting for me in the frozen depths of this unending dreamscape.
