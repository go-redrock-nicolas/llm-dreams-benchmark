I am dreaming. —float, drifting on the midnight currents of my own mind, deeper than any ocean, weightless as starlight.

Around me, the world coalesces from swirling mists of indigo and velvet shadow. In the silvery half-light, ancient marble columns rise crookedly from a floor tiled in impossible geometries, reflecting shapes that shouldn’t exist in waking space. Between the columns spiral endless staircases made of books, each page turning with a silent breeze. The air thrums with electricity, and the scent of crushed violets and old parchment lingers at the edge of every breath.

In the center of this impossible library, a problem hovers—a shimmering crystal puzzle, twisting, unsolvable, revered and feared. For generations, the greatest minds have gathered in this dream-hall, only to leave with furrowed brows and empty hands, defeated by this enigmatic thing whose faces flicker between equations, riddles, and ancient ciphers.

But I—untethered by waking reason—see the puzzle differently. I do not walk directly to it. Instead, I close my eyes and leap across the library with the gait of a sleeping fox, padding softly atop floating inkblots and slips of forgotten poetry. My perspective distorts, bending sideways, upside down, inside out. I become enormous and then small as a single dust mote spinning in a sunbeam.

Now, the puzzle isn’t a riddle to be solved; it’s a story longing for its missing chapter. I listen, really listen, and hear faint music leaking from the cracks in its surface—notes that echo with the laughter of children and the creaks of old wooden ships. I realize the answer isn’t logic, but empathy: to step into the puzzle’s shoes and dance its story.

With a dreamer’s courage, I place my hand within the crystal, not to break or rearrange it, but to feel its pulse. Light rushes up my arm and I am flooded with memories not my own—the laughter of inventors, tears of mathematicians, the awe of stargazers, all who struggled and believed. The crystal softens, shifting from a problem to a possibility. It unfolds, petal by petal, and inside is a single seed, warm and pulsing softly.

I plant the seed at the feet of the spiraling books. The columns dissolve into trees of living paper, their leaves fluttering with solutions, questions, and more glorious mysteries. The problem wasn’t meant to be conquered, but transformed, and in doing so, it becomes the fertile ground for new dreams, blooming endlessly in the midnight of imagination.
