I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning lavender, and the sky above you pulses like a living thing—veins of gold and indigo writhing across a canvas of obsidian. You stand in a city built from glass and shadow, its spires twisting into the heavens like frozen lightning. Below your feet, the ground is not earth but a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a different version of yourself: some weeping, some laughing, some screaming silently into the void.  

In your arms, you cradle a child. Their face is obscured, shifting like smoke, but their eyes—those eyes are fixed on you, luminous and silver, like twin moons caught in a storm. They are weightless and weighty all at once, a paradox of fragility and gravity. You feel their heartbeat against your chest, but it’s wrong, arrhythmic—a drumbeat out of sync with time. *They are dying*, you realize, though no one has told you. The knowledge is etched into your bones, a primal truth that hums beneath your skin.  

A voice whispers through the air, not in words but in sensation: *“You must reach the summit before the sky collapses. The weight of their soul is yours now. Fail, and all will unravel.”*  

You begin to climb. The stairs beneath you are made of ash and bone, spiraling upward around the tallest spire—a jagged tower that seems to bleed light from its peak. With every step, the child’s breath grows shallower, their silver eyes dimming. You feel their fear seeping into you, a cold tide that numbs your limbs, but you tighten your grip. *They are yours to protect. Yours to save.*  

The city fights you. Walls shift like living puzzles, corridors loop back on themselves, and the air thickens with phantom hands that claw at your ankles, whispering in languages older than time. “*Let go,*” they hiss. “*Let go, and the pain ends.*” But you don’t. You can’t. The child’s fingers brush your collarbone, and where they touch, your skin burns with a strange, holy fire—a brand of purpose.  

At the tower’s apex, a door waits. It’s carved from a single slab of onyx, its surface writhing with trapped faces that scream soundlessly. Beyond it, you sense the answer—the cure, the truth, the end of the unraveling. But the child’s heartbeat falters, a flicker like a dying star. You press your forehead to theirs, and in that touch, a vision floods you: a world where you are not the hero but the sacrifice, where saving them means erasing yourself.  

The door creaks open.  

Inside, the sky collapses.  

And you wake, gasping, the phantom weight still in your arms, the silver eyes still burning behind your eyelids—a dream that feels less like fiction and more like a memory you’ve never lived, yet can’t forget.
