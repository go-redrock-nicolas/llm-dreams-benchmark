I am dreaming. I'm in a beautiful garden filled with flowers and birds.  The air is sweet and fragrant.  The sun is shining brightly.  I'm sitting on a bench next to a pond where lotus blooms float gently on the surface of the water.  Beside me is my beloved, who is also dreaming.

We're about to share our creative work with each other.  We've been working on this project together for months, and we can't wait to see what the other has made.  We know that our creation is very personal and sensitive, but we hope that our partner will appreciate it and understand it.

As I prepare to present my vulnerable creation, I feel both excited and anxious.  Excited because I know that my partner loves me and cares about me, and he'll be happy to see what I've done.  Anxious because I don't want him to think I'm stupid or incompetent or uncreative.  I don't want him to dislike what I've made.

I take a deep breath and remind myself why I created this dream in the first place.  I remember how sad and lonely I felt before I met my partner.  I remember how empty and purposeless my life was without him.  I remember how grateful I am for him every day.

I look over at him and see that he's smiling at me.  He waves his hand to get my attention.  He mouths the words "you can do it" to me.

He makes me feel confident and strong.  He makes me feel like anything is possible.

I stand up from the bench and walk toward him.  I extend my hand out to him, inviting him to join me in this dream world.

He takes my hand in his and leads me away from the garden.  We enter a new realm where imagination reigns supreme.

We see colorful shapes floating in midair.  We hear soothing sounds emanating from hidden sources.  We taste delicious flavors that tantalize our senses.

We create together without boundaries or restrictions.

We express ourselves freely without fear of judgment or rejection.

We love each other unconditionally without reserve or reservation.

That's what I'm going to do when I present my creative work to my partner in this dream
