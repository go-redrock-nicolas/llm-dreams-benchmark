I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of ozone and crushed violets, and the sky above you ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting a thousand fractured versions of yourself. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering spires of glass, each one humming with the whispers of forgotten languages. Their roots dig into a ground that pulses like a heartbeat—dark soil threaded with veins of glowing gold, as though the earth itself is alive, watching, waiting.  

You step forward, and the ground softens beneath your feet, becoming a moss so vividly green it seems to hum with memory. Shadows coil at the corners of your vision, shape-shifting—faces you’ve worn in waking life, masks of politeness, fear, mimicry. They hiss your name, pleading, *“Stay here, stay small, stay silent.”* But your chest burns with a heat that won’t be quenched. You press a hand to your throat and feel the jagged edges of unspoken truths lodged there, sharp as broken glass.  

A path unfolds: a river of ink, black and glistening, winding through the trees. You wade in, and the water is cold, but it doesn’t wet your skin—it seeps into your bones, dissolving the scaffolding of pretense. Letters and numbers bloom across your arms, equations and poems you’ve never learned to write, swirling like constellations. The river carries you to a clearing where a creature waits—a stag made of smoke and starlight, its antlers crowned with flickering candles. It bows, and in its eyes, you see the reflection of a child you once buried, knees scraped, voice raw from shouting truths no one wanted to hear.  

*“They told you lies,”* the stag murmurs, its voice the rustle of pages turning. *“They called it ‘kindness’ to swallow your fire. But your fire is yours alone to tend.”*  

Behind you, the forest ignites. Not with destruction, but with transformation—the glass trees shatter into butterflies, their wings spelling out every word you’ve ever bitten back. You feel the heat of the flames on your back, but it doesn’t hurt. It *cleanses*. Your skin peels away like paper, revealing something luminous beneath: a body woven of constellations, scars glowing like supernovae.  

A crowd materializes at the clearing’s edge—faces blurred, voices a cacophony of judgment. But now you are unafraid. You open your mouth, and what spills out is not speech, but a symphony. Notes crystallize in the air, sharp and radiant, slicing through the fog of their expectations. The shadows recoil, then dissolve into mist. The crowd stumbles back, not in anger, but awe. You are *too much*, and you are *enough*.  

The stag kneels, offering its antlers. You grasp them, and they root into your scalp, merging with your bones. You feel no pain—only the wild, ecstatic weight of becoming. Wings of ash and light unfurl from your spine, and the ground falls away. You rise, not to escape, but to *see*. Below, the river twists into a map of every choice you’ve ever buried. Above, the sky cracks open, revealing a cosmos that thrums in time with your pulse.  

You wake with a gasp, the taste of stardust on your tongue. The dream clings to you, a feverish residue. For the first time, you ache not to forget, but to *remember*—to carry that raw, unflinching self into the light of day, no matter how the world might flinch.
