I am dreaming. Sitting in a circle with perfect strangers, moments stretch into hours as the silence is filled with a buzzing void. Comfort forgotten, the floor beneath me is barely acknowledged. An unseen spotlight radiates warmth above my head, focusing the moment into a perfect freeze-frame.

The scent of fresh mountain air fills my nostrils as the shadows lengthen; a trembling whisper seeps from the lips around me. "What aspect of yourself do you dislike the most?" The question is as ancient as it is terrifying.

Suddenly, hidden truths and buried secrets lay bare, fumbling their way through layers of self-delusion and rationalization. In hues of obsidian black and ethereal silver, the words curl their way toward me, wrapping me tighter than vines in a black forest. Judgment, and yet a profound longing for compassion, rise within me, tugging at the same heartstrings.

I breathe in the essence of my deepest self and exhale the harsh, unrelenting criticisms that coat the skeletons dwelling in my closet. Looking at the faces surrounding me, vibrant portals into my innermost depths, I realize they are reflecting the parts of me that I have not fully acknowledged, accepted or embraced.

A mirror projecting the verdicts I cast on others back onto myself, my own self-doubts taking shape within their eyes. With each gentle glance, a kaleidoscope of choices reveals that what I condemn in others truly mirrors the unloved components I battle to recognize within myself.
