I am dreaming. You’re standing at the edge of a city that isn’t a city—its skyline is a jagged collage of crumbling Gothic spires, neon-lit data towers pulsing like arrhythmic hearts, and colossal clockwork gears grinding in midair, their teeth the horizon. The ground beneath your feet is a mosaic of shattered mirrors reflecting not your face, but endless variations of yourself: one with wings, one with serpents for hair, one dissolving into static. Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, shifting between day and night every few seconds, casting shadows that move independently of their objects. You hear a thousand whispers in languages you’ve never learned but somehow *understand*—equations, poetry, screams, lullabies—all colliding in your skull like shrapnel.  

A train made of living smoke hurtles past you, its cars filled with faceless passengers who turn to smoke themselves as it rounds a bend that defies geometry, folding inward like a Möbius strip dipped in acid. You realize you’re holding a device in your hand—a pulsating orb of black glass and bioluminescent vines—that’s feeding you data streams faster than your mind can parse. *Save the child. Destroy the core. Choose the left eye or the right. The mountain is a prison. The river is a scream. The stars are watching. The stars are hungry.*  

You sprint forward, though your legs feel submerged in liquid lead, toward a colossal door made of petrified wood and circuitry, its keyhole shaped like an ouroboros. Behind you, the ground fractures into floating islands, each one a fragment of a different reality: a desert of liquid mirrors, a forest of frozen screams, a library where the books bleed when opened. A choice materializes—a glowing dagger in one hand, a vial of liquid starlight in the other—and a voice that sounds like your own, but warped into a growl, demands: *“Sacrifice the memory of joy or the memory of pain. Neither is true. Both are fatal.”*  

As you hesitate, the orb in your pocket erupts into a cacophony of visions: a child drowning in a sea of clocks, a black hole singing a lullaby in your mother’s voice, a version of yourself crowned with a crown of wasps, ruling a kingdom of ash. Your temples throb. The air tastes of burnt honey and battery acid. You realize the door is *breathing*, its surface rippling like a lung, and the key to opening it isn’t a key at all—it’s your own spine, which you now feel cracking, vertebra by vertebra, as the weight of the decision metastasizes in your chest.  

Then—a gunshot. Or a heartbeat. Or a star collapsing.  

You wake up screaming, but the dream clings to you like a second skin, its fragments lodged in your synapses, whispering: *“You chose wrong. You chose right. You chose. You chose. You chose.”*
