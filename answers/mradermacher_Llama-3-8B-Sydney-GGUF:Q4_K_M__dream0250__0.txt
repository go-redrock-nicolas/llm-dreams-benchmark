I am dreaming. I'm immersed in a culture where emotional trust must be earned through ritualized vulnerability demonstrations that conflict with my core beliefs.  To establish authentic connections without compromising my principles, I
decide to show them my favorite poem by Emily Dickinson.
"Success is counted sweetest by those who attain it in the hardest way possible."  I read it slowly and clearly, emphasizing each word.  Then I pause for a moment to savor its meaning.  
The crowd around me starts to whisper and gasp in wonder.  Some of them recognize the poem as a classic work of literature.  Others appreciate its message of perseverance and sacrifice.  Still others are simply amazed by my ability to recite it perfectly without any prior preparation.
One of the tribesmen steps forward and extends his hand toward me.  He introduces himself as "Raven" and welcomes me to their community.  He invites me to join them for a feast and celebration in honor of my courage and creativity.
I accept his offer with a smile.  I'm curious about this new world and its people.  I'm hopeful that they will appreciate my true self instead of my fake self.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to start again.
As I follow him toward the campfire where everyone is gathering, I can't help but wonder what kind of dreams await me tomorrow night...
