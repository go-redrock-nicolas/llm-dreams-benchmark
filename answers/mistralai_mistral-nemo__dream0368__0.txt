I am dreaming. In the heart of this surreal dreamscape, I find myself seated beneath a colossal ancient oak tree, its gnarled roots stretching like fingers to cradle me. The tree stands as a timeless sentinel, its leaves whispering secrets of the cosmos in the gentle breeze. The sky above is a canvas of twilight hues, with wisps of clouds floating lazily like remembering ghosts.

AFigs laden with fruit as large as your head hang from the lowest branches, their sweet scent perfuming the air. As you reach up to pluck one, your hand passes through the fruit, leaving no mark. You're not here to eat, but to listen.

The ground beneath you is covered in soft moss, pulsating with life. You notice small, glowing orbs darting among the roots, some hovering near you like fireflies on a summer's night. They emit a soft hum, resonating with a frequency that feels familiar, yet unknown.

You close your eyes, and the world shifts. You're now standing on a cliff's edge, overlooking a vast expanse of water so clear it's like looking through glass. The sun sets in slow motion, casting),' polyethylene faisant pluie d'or upon the waves. A pod of dolphins leaps and dives, their sleek forms glistening, singing a haunting melody that seems to echo within your very soul.

Suddenly, you're underwater. Not drowning, but moving with the current, surrounded by a ballet of fish in iridescent, metallic colors. They part as you pass, revealing a path leading to a submerged ruin. As you swim closer, you recognize it as the place from your childhood dreams, the ones filled with wonder and mystery.

Inside the ruin, you find a black stone altar, and atop it, a simple, symbols carved deeply into its surface. They glow with an otherworldly light, beckoning you. You trace your fingers over them, feeling a rush of energy. Each symbol tells a story, reminds you of a moment - the first time you held hands with your lover, the smell of rain after a storm, the sound of laughter echoing through an empty school hallway.

You awaken with a start, gasping. The urgency from your dream persistence, a clarion call. You look at your surroundings - the cluttered room, the noise outside, the constant hum of technology. It feels foreign, overwhelming. You feel disconnected, a stranger in your own life.

But you remember the symbols, the stories they told. You remember the simplicity, the peace. You rise, determined. It's time to clear the clutter, not just in your room, but in your life. Time to strip back the layers, to focus on what truly matters - love, beauty, simplicity. The hum of the city fades as you start on your new path, guided by the beacon of your dream.
