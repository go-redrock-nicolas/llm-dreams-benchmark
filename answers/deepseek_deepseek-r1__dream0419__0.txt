I am dreaming. [psychological comfort, self-reflective narrative, symbolic imagery], written by Vladimir Nabokov.
Okay, the user wants me to create a vivid dream exploring the discomfort of receiving genuine praise. They mentioned using symbolic imagery and a self-reflective narrative in the style of Nabokov. First, I need to recall Nabokov's style: rich, poetic language, intricate metaphors, and a focus on inner states. 

I should start by setting a dreamlike scene. Maybe a surreal environment that symbolizes the tension between wanting recognition and the unease it brings. Mirrors could be a good symbol here, reflecting the self and others' perceptions. Blazing hearts might represent genuine praise that feels too intense. 

The narrative should delve into the protagonist's internal conflict. Maybe the mirrors distort when praise is given, showing how the self-image becomes unstable. Translucent words dissolving into smoke could symbolize the fleeting nature of praise and the fear of scrutiny. 

Including symbols like marble tongues and frozen roses would add layers. Tongues that harden upon speaking praise suggest discomfort in giving or receiving it. Frozen roses could symbolize beauty that's cold or unattainable. 

Ending with a labyrinth of mirrors converging into a shadow without features shows the loss of identity when overwhelmed by others' perceptions. Waking up in cold moonlight ties back to the coldness of the roses and the lingering unease. 

I need to ensure the language is lush and vivid, with attention to sensory details. Each symbol should tie back to the theme of discomfort with praise. Keep the flow dreamlike, shifting scenes fluidly. Check for consistency in metaphors and ensure the psychological depth is present.

You stand in a hallway of liquid mirrors, their surfaces serpentine and shivering. The air hums with unseen bees. Someone is applauding. Each clap detonates like the snapping of a star’s core, sending ripples through the mirrors. Your reflection fractures—not into pieces, but into *versions*: a child holding a ribboned trophy, a shadow with a crown of nails, a figure cloaked in ash, mouth stitched with spider silk. You try to bow, but your spine bends into a question mark.  

A voice, velvet and thorned, pours from the walls: *“How dare you hold this light?”*  

Beneath your feet, the floor becomes a mosaic of blazing hearts, each ventricles a flickering gallery of faces—teachers, lovers, strangers—all mouthing *brilliant, extraordinary, sublime.* The heat blisters your soles, yet when you scramble backward, the hearts cling like burrs, searing louder with every step. You peel one off; it whispers *fraud* in your mother’s timbre.  

A door appears, framed by marble tongues. The knob is a frozen rose. Inside, a banquet table stretches into fog. Guests with opal eyes raise goblets of liquid praise. You sip; it tastes of hyacinth and bile. “To your triumph,” they chorus, but their teeth are splintered glass. The room constricts. Chandeliers droop like jellyfish, stinging your shoulders with prismatic venom.  

You flee. The hallway now narrows to a tunnel of eyes—pupils dilated, unblinking. Each blink you withhold swells the darkness. A child’s laughter coils around your throat. It tightens. Your breath becomes a cicada shell, hollow and crisp.  

When the mirrors finally shatter, the shards don’t fall. They hover, each reflecting not your face, but a miniature stage where puppets with your features enact victories to an audience of crows. The crows nod, then pluck out the puppets’ glass eyes, swallowing them with a sound like wet applause.  

You wake in a room without walls. The moon is a cataract. Your hands are petals—translucent, dissolving at the edges. A single word etches itself in frost on your ribs: *Hiraeth.* The longing for a home you never inhabited, or perhaps demolished yourself, one whispered *well done* at a time.
