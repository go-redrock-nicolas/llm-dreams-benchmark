I am dreaming. I stand at the crossroads of a forest that shouldn't exist. The path to my left glimmers with moonlight filtering through crystal leaves, each one tinkling like wind chimes when the warm breeze passes. The path to my right burns with autumn colors so vibrant they seem to breathe, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath the forest floor.

Before me stands a woman with skin like polished obsidian and hair that contains constellations I've never seen – they shift and rearrange with each breath she takes. In one hand she holds a book bound in what looks like water, somehow solid yet flowing; in the other, a key made of what appears to be compressed time, memories visibly swirling within its translucent form.

"Choose," she whispers, her voice echoing as if spoken from inside my own mind. "The book contains the story of everyone you've ever loved and how to heal their deepest wounds. The key unlocks your greatest potential – talents beyond imagining, the fullness of your creativity unleashed."

The air grows thick with impossible scents – the smell of my childhood home braided with the fragrance of places I've never been. I reach toward the book, thinking of those I love who suffer, but my fingers tingle painfully as they near it. I reach for the key instead, and my heart constricts with a grief I cannot name.

I cannot have both. The woman's eyes, filled with galaxies, tell me this truth without words.

As I struggle with the decision, the forest floor beneath me begins to liquefy, turning to a mirror that reflects not my face but all the versions of myself that might exist should I choose either path. The reflections multiply endlessly, fracturing and reforming.

My hand trembles between the two gifts, understanding that whichever I choose, I lose something irreplaceable...
