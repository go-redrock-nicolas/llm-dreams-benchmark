I am dreaming. I know it now, though I didn’t when it began. 

The elevator is old, its brass panels dented and dulled with rust, and it creaks like a whale’s bones deep beneath the ocean floor. There are no buttons. No call button. No emergency hatch. Just me, and the slow rush of cold, dark water pouring in through unseen seams beneath my feet.

I gasp.

The water rises steadily, like the breath of something vast stirring in the dark below. It coils around my ankles, shockingly cold, and carries the scent of algae, salt, and ancient things that never saw sunlight. I press against the back wall, my heartbeat thrashing against my ribs like a trapped bird fighting to get free.

I remember that I was wearing gloves when I stepped in. Now they are gone. My fingers are pale. Human, but alien somehow, like they belong to someone else. I swim upward, but although the water rises—it never reaches the ceiling. It's as though it only wants me half-drowned. Only wants to push me toward the invisible threshold between breath and suffocation.

Above me, the crystalline ceiling ripples like glass beneath rain.

I float, watching the surface that isn't quite water anymore, but something deeper, mercuric and glistening, reflecting dreams I never dreamed. I see my own face in its mirror—and it isn’t my own. It looks back at me with wide eyes made of rubies and peat earth. Teeth like pearls and pine needles.

I scream, and bubbles spiral toward the top like little silver ghosts.

The water isn't trying to kill me, I realize—it’s trying to change me.

I see faces in the fluid walls now: half-formed, crying out silently, pulled into the rushing tide of visions. A woman made of coral and clock parts. A child riding a whale of static electricity through a sky of shattered glass. Cities bloom in the ripples and then drown, only to rise again as palaces of bone and ivory. The water is memory. It is history, ancient and unknowable. It is the womb of something waking up.

Somewhere unseen, a bell chimes.

 metal door groans and creaks open to reveal not escape—but an oceanic expanse swelling with stars. Not stars in sky, but stars in water, scattered like dropped thoughts across the wavering cosmos, each one lighting a memory or a future that isn’t mine but now bleeds into my skin.

I stop resisting.

The water that once threatened now cradles me, drifting me forward like a whisper on the tide. My lungs don’t ache any longer. I’m breathing in rhythm with the depths, and I realize—I always could have.

This elevator was never falling.

It was submerging.

And now, I open the elevator door fully, letting in the glowing tide.

Everything washes away—fear, boundary, flesh. There is only motion now. Only water. And within it, something begins to grow.

No longer human.

No longer alone.
