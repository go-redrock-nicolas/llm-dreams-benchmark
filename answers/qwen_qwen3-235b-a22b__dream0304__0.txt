I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You fall through a mirror, not breaking it, but becoming liquid in the process—your body melting like ink spilled across a glassy void. When you land, it’s on a forest floor woven from threads of starlight and smoke. The trees here are alive in a way that defies biology: their trunks pulse with bioluminescent veins, their leaves are shards of stained glass that sing in harmonic whispers when the wind passes through them. Above, the sky is a rotating kaleidoscope, constellations morphing into faces you almost recognize—your childhood dog, a stranger’s smile, a forgotten god.  

You feel it then: the *urge*. A magnetic pull in your chest, sharp and sweet as a sugar rush to the heart. It whispers, *Run. Climb. Leap. Break the rules of gravity, time, consequence.* Ahead, a labyrinth of floating staircases spirals into nothingness, each step flickering between solid and spectral. Logic tells you to map the path, calculate risks, *be careful*. But the dream doesn’t want your logic. It wants your pulse.  

You sprint.  

Your feet barely touch the stairs—they solidify only when you stop thinking, dissolve when you hesitate. A laugh erupts from your throat, wild and unrecognizable, as you vault over a railing and catch a gust of cinnamon-scented wind that wasn’t there a moment ago. Below, the forest floor yawns open like a mouth, revealing a churning abyss of clock gears and dandelion seeds. Falling would mean oblivion—or revelation. The dream thrums, waiting for your choice.  

Then you see *her*: a woman made of shadows and stained glass, standing atop the highest staircase. Her eyes are twin eclipses, her hair a swarm of fireflies fleeing some unseen terror. She holds out a key forged from bone and moonlight. “You’re too late,” she says, her voice the echo of a door slamming shut. “Or too early. Depends who you ask.”  

The urge sharpens. *Take the key. Shatter the sky. Burn the map.* But now there’s a counterweight—a memory of a promise, a name whispered in a moment of vulnerability. Caution coils around your ankles like ivy, rooting you. What if the fall *does* kill you? What if the dream ends and you forget this feeling forever?  

The labyrinth shifts. The stairs become bridges of ice, then ropes of liquid mercury, then veins of your own childhood memories—your fifth birthday, a goodbye at a train station, the first time you tasted fear. The keywoman fades, leaving the key hovering in the air, humming a lullaby.  

You reach for it.  

A thunderclap. The sky cracks open, spilling hourglasses filled with black sand. One shatters at your feet. Inside, a miniature version of yourself begins to cry, tears pooling into a river that carves canyons into the dream. You understand: this is the crossroads. Impulse would unravel you into a thousand reckless threads. Caution would smother the spark that makes the dream *yours*.  

So you do neither.  

You close your eyes and *breathe*.  

When you open them, the labyrinth is gone. You stand on a cliff overlooking an ocean of liquid mercury, the key warm in your palm. The keywoman’s voice drifts from the horizon: “Took you long enough.” The dream softens, no longer a fever but a flame. You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue and the certainty that some truths are too vast for planning—or panic. They’re meant to be *lived*, one heartbeat at a time.
