I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself walking along the edge of a vast, iridescent lake, its surface shimmering with colors that don’t exist in the waking world—shades between violet and gold, hues that pulse like liquid opals under a sky streaked with nebulous light. The air smells of petrichor and something sweetly unfamiliar, like crushed starfruit dusted with cinnamon.

As I step closer, the water ripples, though there is no wind. A voice, neither male nor female but resonant like a cello played underwater, echoes from its depths: *"You seek meaning, but the thread you follow is woven into everything."*

Suddenly, the lake divides, parting like a curtain to reveal a staircase of floating stones, each inscribed with symbols that shift when I try to focus—ancient glyphs one moment, musical notes the next. Compelled, I step onto the first stone, and the world tilts. Time unravels. I see my own memories flicker in the water below, but they’re wrong—*adjusted*. In one, I’m a child laughing under a tree whose leaves are tiny mirrors, each reflecting a different version of me. In another, I’m old, planting seeds that sprout into constellations.  

Halfway down the staircase, a figure emerges from the lake’s center—a being of tangled light and shadow, their form echoing birds in flight, then collapsing into a hundred hands holding fragments of broken pottery. *"You’ve always known,"* they murmur, pressing a shard into my palm. Inside it, a scene pulses: me, kneeling in a field, stitching the horizon back together with needle and thread.  

The dream shudders. The sky cracks like an eggshell, and through the fissure, I see—*for the briefest instant*—an infinite corridor of doors, each bearing my name in a different language. Then, warmth. A whisper: *"This is where you begin."*  

I wake with the taste of salt and honey on my tongue, the dream’s colors bleeding into the dawn.
