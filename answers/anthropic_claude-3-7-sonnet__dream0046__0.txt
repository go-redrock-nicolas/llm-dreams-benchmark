I am dreaming. I stand at a busy intersection downtown, people flowing around me like water around stone. Something feels wrong—the air carries an electric tension that no one else seems to notice. The sky above has taken on a strange amber hue, but pedestrians continue their commutes, faces buried in phones.

My skin prickles with awareness as I spot the first sign—birds, hundreds of them, flying in perfect geometric formations rather than their usual chaotic patterns. They move with mechanical precision, as if orchestrated by some invisible conductor. 

A low-frequency hum begins vibrating through my shoes. I press my palm against a nearby building wall—it's trembling. Digital billboards flicker, momentarily displaying fragmented code before returning to advertisements. My mouth goes dry as I realize something massive is approaching.

I try calling out, but my voice seems swallowed by the thickening air. A businessman passes, and I grab his sleeve. "Don't you feel that? Look at the birds!" He yanks away, annoyed, never breaking stride.

The storm drains begin gurgling, releasing not water but a luminescent blue mist that hugs the ground. Trees along the boulevard bend unnaturally, not from wind but as if responding to some gravitational anomaly. My phone dies without warning, along with every electronic device in sight.

My heart hammers against my ribs as I understand with absolute clarity—something impossible is breaching our reality. A line of staticky pressure moves through the city block by block, distorting everything it touches. Time seems to stretch and contract around me.

I need to warn them all, but how do you explain the unexplainable? The crowd remains oblivious while the very fabric of existence ripples around us, and I alone stand witness to the threshold of an event that will transform everything we know.
