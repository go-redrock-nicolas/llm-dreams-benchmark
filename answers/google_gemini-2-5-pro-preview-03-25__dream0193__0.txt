I am dreaming. I'm attempting to reconstruct a shattered stained-glass window depicting a forgotten constellation, but the pieces are scattered throughout a library where the books rearrange themselves according to the Dewey Decimal system of emotions. The shattered pieces only respond to celestial mechanics principles sung in ancient Sumerian, a language I've never learned. The library itself is housed within a giant, bioluminescent jellyfish drifting aimlessly through theHorsehead Nebula. Every time I get close to piecing together a significant star, the jellyfish pulses, changing the library's gravitational pull and sending books (and glass shards) flying according to the emotional turbulence of the nearest readerâ€”currently a melancholic historian weeping over lost Mesopotamian treatises on astral navigation. My usual meticulous A/B testing, cross-referencing historical astronomical charts, and even attempting basic translation software for the Sumerian hymns are laughably inadequate. The jellyfish's pulses disrupt my Wi-Fi signal to the nebula's (hypothetical) infosphere, and the historian's tears keep short-circuiting my spectral analysis tools needed to date the glass. It's a kaleidoscope of failures: linguistic inadequacy meets gravitational chaos meets emotional interference meets astrophysical plumbing issues. Conventional logic is dissolving like sugar in cosmic tea.
