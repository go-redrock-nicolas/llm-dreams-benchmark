I am dreaming. I am in my bedroom.  It is night time.  The wind is howling outside.  The rain is pouring down.  The lightning is flashing.  The thunder is roaring. 
I am lying on my bed.  I am wearing a white night gown.  I am alone. 

My mind is racing with thoughts.  My heart is pounding with fear.  My skin is sweating with nervousness. 

I am afraid of going to the social gathering.  I am afraid of meeting new people.  I am afraid of talking to strangers.  I am afraid of making mistakes.  I am afraid of being judged.  

I don't want to go to the social gathering.  I don't want to meet new people.  I don't want to talk to strangers.  I don't want to make mistakes.  I don't want to be
judged. 

But I have to go to the social gathering.  But I have to meet new people.  But I have to talk to strangers.  But I have to make mistakes.  But I have to be judged. 

Why do I have to go?  Why do I have to meet them?  Why do I have to talk to them?  Why do I have to make mistakes?  Why do I have to be judged?

I don't know why I have to go.  I don't know why I have to meet them.  I don't know why I have to talk to them.  I don't know why I have to make
mystakes.  I don't know why I have to be judged.

All I know is that I am in my bedroom.  It is night time.  The wind is howling outside.  The rain is pouring down.  The lightning is flashing.  The thunder is roaring. 

And I am afraid.
