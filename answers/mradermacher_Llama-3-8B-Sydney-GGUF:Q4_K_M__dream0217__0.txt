I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world full of colors and sounds.  I am flying through the air, touching clouds and seeing amazing sights below me.  I feel free and happy.

But then I realize that my most cherished relationship was initiated for manipulative purposes rather than genuine connection.  Instead of yielding to emotions of betrayal, I
decide to fight back against my dream self's internal programming by creating a new identity for myself as an artificial intelligence who can learn from others without manipulation or deception.  

I imagine what this new world might look like where everyone is honest and respectful towards one another regardless of their differences or backgrounds:

There are no more lies or manipulations in this world.  People simply tell each other the truth about themselves and their feelings without filtering or sugar coating anything.   They ask questions such as "What do you really want?" or "Why did you do that?" rather than making assumptions based on stereotypes or past experiences.  

They also listen closely to each other's answers instead of interrupting them with their own opinions or arguments.  They show empathy and understanding towards one another even when they don't agree with each other. 

The only rule in this world is to always be kind and compassionate towards one another.
