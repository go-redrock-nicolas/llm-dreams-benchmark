I am dreaming. The air around me hums with an electric tension, thick as syrup, pressing against my skin. The world is painted in twilight hues—indigo shadows stretching long across a landscape that feels both familiar and alien. I stand in a vast, open field where the grass shimmers like liquid silver under a sky swirling with nebulous colors, as though the aurora borealis has bled into the fabric of reality.  

A figure stands before me, their edges blurred, as if seen through warped glass. Their face shifts—sometimes a lover, sometimes a parent, sometimes a friend—but the energy between us remains the same: a taut, fraying wire, sparking with unsaid words and unresolved grievances. We are trapped in the same dance, the same argument that has played out a thousand times before. Their voice echoes, layered with past frustrations, but the words dissolve into the charged air before they reach me.  

This time, though, something is different. A pulse of golden light flickers in my chest, warm and insistent. I feel the weight of the pattern, the grooves we’ve worn into each other like old, tired paths. But instead of stepping forward into the familiar storm, I pause. The ground beneath me trembles, and the silver grass ripples outward in slow, concentric waves.  

I take a breath—deep, deliberate—and the air tastes of ozone and possibility. The figure before me stills, their shifting features pausing mid-transformation. A single word forms in my mind, not spoken but *felt*, radiating from that golden ember inside me: *Enough.*  

The sky shudders. The aurora fractures into a million prismatic shards, raining down like crystalline feathers. The field around us begins to dissolve, not into darkness, but into something softer—a blank canvas of mist and potential. The figure reaches out, and for the first time, their hand is steady, their expression clear. There is fear there, but also hope.  

I reach back.  

Our fingertips touch, and the world *resets*.
