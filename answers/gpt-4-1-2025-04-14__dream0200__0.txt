I am dreaming. —I stand barefoot at the edge of a boundless glass lake beneath a sky swirling with lavender and honey-colored clouds. The water’s surface ripples with my every trembling breath, mirroring both the dawn and the dusk—the liminal hours in which dreams are born and fears come seeking.

My entire existence has led to this trembling cusp. Before me, drifting upon the glimmering water, is a bridge of books—each tome bound in leather, pages glowing faintly from within. Every step forward is a step across my own stories: the labors, hopes, heartbreaks, and ceaseless effort wound tightly into my life’s prized ambition.

At the bridge’s end, shrouded in mist, rises a citadel made entirely out of the words and ideas I have penned, towering like a cathedral of possibility. Its windows pulse with gentle golden light, as if breathing in time with the universe’s heart.

Despite the heady promise, an anxious chorus clamors within my chest: What if it’s not enough? What if I am unworthy? The air smells of anticipation—citrus zest and rain on hot stone. My hands are ink-stained, trembling but unbowed.

With a heart heavier than a thousand suns and lighter than a feather, I summon the entirety of my being, placing foot upon the first book. The lake shimmers; the texts beneath me become weightless, carrying me upward. Behind me, shadows of doubt curl and twist, trying to reclaim me, but I press onward, drawn by the radiant promise ahead.

As I approach the citadel’s threshold, the doors open, and inside, the people I have loved, the mentors who believed in me, and even the heroes of my imagination stand, waiting in silent encouragement. Their presence buoys me.

The ultimate test? To enter, I must speak aloud my deepest truth—the spark that set this dream ablaze long ago. Voice wavering but clear, I declare, “I am worthy, because I dared to dream, and I dared to do.”

In a rush of wind and light, the citadel welcomes me home, and I step forward, becoming a part of the dream that shaped me, and knowing, at last, that the journey was never just about the goal—it was about becoming the person who would finally cross that shining threshold.
