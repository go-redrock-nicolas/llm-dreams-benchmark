I am dreaming. I wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology. As I explore, I realize I need toThe dream begins not with a whisper, but a *roar*—a gale-force wind tearing through the fabric of the here and now. You jolt awake, sheets clinging to sweat-damp skin, but the room is gone. Instead, you’re suspended in a void the color of rusted copper, where constellations twist like vines. A distant bell chimes once, and the world fractures.  

You open your eyes underwater, goggles pressed to your face. The liquid isn’t salt or fresh; it’s liquid twilight—deep violet, streaked with bioluminescent bubbles that burst into swirling constellations. Schools of fish with pelts like cedar bark dart past, their whisker-like fins brushing your temples. Below, the seabed ripples with ruins: columns of black obsidian carved with spirals that *move*, coiling and uncoiling like living script. A stone door embedded in the earth yawns open, emitting a hum that vibrates in your molars.  

You climb out onto a beach baked the hue of a bruise, your feet sinking into sand that oozes like liquid obsidian. The sky here has no curvature—stars burn in straight, burning lines, and a moon cracked like a thundercloud looms overhead. In the distance, a city pulses with lanternlight, but its towers are inverted—one spire is a tree root, clawing skyward, dripping sap that crystallizes into glass pearls.  

A figure emerges from a thicket of flowers that hum like bees. It’s a child, ethereal as a campfire shadow, their hair a halo of dried wheat, but their eyes are constellations. “You’ve come for the key,” they say, voice like wind chimes breaking. They toss you a keyblade made of something that flickers between bone, mercury, and starlight. “The Storm-Keeper takes tonight. If you don’t guide the clouds to the grove of singing roots, the tides will swallow all.”  

You run, boots crunching glass-pearls underfoot. The city is alive with a cacophony of whispers—shopfronts selling everything from kraken teeth to melodies bottled in amber. A baker hands you a crescent-shaped loaf that oozes liquid rye whisky. You drink it. The world warps: your shadow sprouts antlers, and the pavement beneath you splits to reveal stairs spiraling into an abyss where pendulum clocks swim in oil.  

At the bottom, a cathedral made of teeth andziplock bags holds the Storm-Keeper—a figure cloaked in storm-gray, their head a detached mannequin with a ticking radio inside it. Rain falls upward. The Keeper laughs, old vinyl record scratching. They clutch a miniature storm, swirling in a jar of maple syrup. “Pay up,” they hiss. “Or drown.”  

You realize the keyblade isn’t a key. It’s a timeline. You saw your reflection in one of the singing roots—the dreamer isn’t you. You’re a *void* in the narrative, a glitch to be resolved. Time is a liquid here. You pour yourself into the keyblade as the storm ascends. Your veins tingle with the weight of every unasked question, every unsent letter, every half-lit cigarette ever abandoned. The Keeper screams as the syrup-thick storm implodes, and you wake up…  

Breathless, in bed. A single keyblade-shaped scar glows on your palm. Your phone lies shattered on the floor—but on the cracked screen, a video plays: static overlay zooms in on a thumbnail. It’s you, in the cathedral, screaming backward into the abyss. The date says July 12th… tomorrow.
