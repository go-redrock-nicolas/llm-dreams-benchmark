I am dreaming. …slip through the paper-thin membrane that separates caution from courage, and the whole dream cracks open like a geode.

At first there is only darkness—soft, velvety, almost comforting, the familiar womb of every risk you never took. You float in it, hearing distant heartbeats that might be your own or echoes of unlived adventures. Then, somewhere above, a pinprick of gold dawns. It whispers your name with the voice of a far-off sunrise, and curiosity flares hotter than fear. You reach.

A single step, and the blackness shatters into prismatic glass. Jagged shards drift around you, reflecting scenes of all the roads you dodged because they looked thorny. Each shard shows a “what-if”: a blank canvas never painted, a train never boarded, a love letter half-written then burned. They orbit like slow satellites, glittering yet brittle. You instinctively dodge them—habits of avoidance ingrained so deep they feel like bone memory—but tonight the dream does not allow the easy exit.

You steady your breath. On the invisible horizon a new landscape births itself: rolling hills the color of ripe apricots, rivers of liquid indigo, and skies stitched with green constellations that hum a lullaby in reverse. The air tastes of sugarcane and sea spray and something indefinably electric. This is the territory of possibility, and it beckons with outstretched hands.

A wind rises, scattering the shards of “no” and “maybe later” like chaff. Suddenly your feet are bare on warm moss. The moss glows faintly, replying to each heartbeat with a pulse of light. It feels as though the earth itself is encouraging you forward, a cosmic crowd chanting, “Choose joy. Choose joy.”

You walk—and then you run—down a hill that smells of nectarine skin after rain. At the bottom stands a wooden gate, ornate as a cathedral door yet weightless as origami. Carved across its arch in looping script is a question you rarely let yourself ask: What do you ache to become? 

You answer by pushing the gate. It swings wide on hinges made of birdsong.

Beyond lies a carnival of unreal colors. Calliope music drips from the clouds like honeyed brass. Ferris wheels spin in reverse, lifting riders into the past so they can retrieve forgotten dreams and set them in their pockets for safe keeping. You step onto a cobblestone path of violet quartz that hums underfoot, each stone sparking a memory of something brave you once imagined doing. The path leads to three tents:

1. A crimson tent where a troupe of paper-thin elephants balances on silver threads, trumpeting laughter. When you enter, they fold their ears into origami boats and sail across a pool of liquid mirror, reminding you how delight can float even on the surface of uncertainty.

2. A sapphire tent glowing with bioluminescent script that writes itself across the canvas walls: “Dare to taste the unknown.” Inside, chefs made of stardust plate constellations on porcelain, and a single bite lets you hear the music of galaxies still forming. You realize risk can be flavor, not poison.

3. A sun-yellow tent where a thousand doors churn like clockwork gears. Each door is etched with a dream you shelved. Some are small—learning to whistle with two fingers, planting a lilac tree. Others are seismic—moving across oceans, saying “I love you” first. The doors clack open and closed in a syncopated heartbeat. You feel the thrum in your sternum, an invitation, a dare.

You choose the brightest door, a shimmering copper aperture labeled simply “Now.” The handle is warm as summer sand. As you grasp it, the carnival quiets, the calliope hushes, and you hear only the wind spelling your future in Morse code. Three short taps: go.

You step through.

Suddenly you are weightless, soaring over a topography stitched from all potential joys—a quilt of luminous possibilities. Below, cities of laughter bloom, forests of serenading cicadas stretch to violet horizons, oceans reflect impossible moons. You are the comet tail of your own decision. 

In that sky, you look down at the fear you’ve worn like heavy armor and see it unbuckle, plate by plate, falling away into the ink of yesterday. It does not crash or shatter; it dissolves into tiny silver seeds that drift earthward, ready to grow into lessons rather than limitations.

High above, a new sun ignites, incandescent aquamarine. It paints your skin with courage. You realize joy isn’t merely a reward for surviving risk; it is the fuel that makes risk luminous. Without it, choices are corridors with no windows. With it, every turn is stained-glass possibility.

You stretch your arms, and wings unfold—feathered with iridescent intentions. On each feather is scrawled a verb your heart has been too timid to conjugate: create, explore, confess, leap, bloom. Beating once, twice, thrice, the wings lift you higher until even the sky seems startled by your ascent.

From that height, you can see the architecture of your life: the scaffolding of caution and the cathedrals of joy not yet built. You understand now that pain-avoidance is a cautious map sketched by fearful cartographers, showing only the territory already known. Joy-pursuit is a blank compass pointing toward white spaces where dragons could be—or treasure. And maybe dragons are just treasure wearing scales.

So you bank toward the uncharted. You dive through clouds that taste like peach sorbet and land atop a cliff of crystal daisies chiming in the breeze. The daisies’ melodies form words: “Live forward.” You answer by laughing, a sound so bright it paints rainbows on the canyon walls.

In that moment, you promise the dream—and yourself—that waking life will echo this vow. That each decision will be asked, “Is this a step toward delight?” That fear may speak, but joy will have the final vote. 

A bell tolls somewhere distant, the gentle knell of dawn. The dream begins to fade at the edges, colors slipping toward morning grayscale. Before it dissolves, you tuck one iridescent feather behind your ear—a souvenir, a reminder.

You open your eyes to the quiet room, heart still wing-thundering, and whisper the last vow of the night: 

“Today, I choose the door labeled Now.”
