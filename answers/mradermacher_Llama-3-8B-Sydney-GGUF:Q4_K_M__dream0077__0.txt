I am dreaming. I am in charge of a high-risk operation where each detail must be meticulously executed.  When my team starts making small errors, I know that it is time for me to take action.  

I am walking through the woods with my team of soldiers.  We are carrying heavy weapons and equipment.  We are searching for a hidden base camp run by our enemies.  We have been tracking their movements for weeks.  We have finally found their location.  

But we also know that they have been waiting for us.  They have been setting traps for us.  They have been preparing for this battle.  

I look around at my team.  I see their determined faces.  I hear their steady footsteps.  I feel their sense of purpose.  

I know that they trust me.  They know that I will not fail them.  They know that I will do whatever it takes to win this war.  

But I also know that I am not perfect.  I know that I can make mistakes.  I know that I can be surprised by unexpected events.  

That is why I must be vigilant.  That is why I must be prepared.  That is why I must always be ready to adapt and improvise.  

I stop walking for a moment and listen to the sounds of the forest.  I hear the rustling of leaves.  I hear the chirping of birds.  I hear the gurgling of water.  

But I don't hear any signs of life other than my own.  I don't see any movement other than that of my team.  I don't smell any scent other than that of the soil and plants.  

This worries me.  This makes me wonder if we have made a mistake.  This makes me question my decisions and choices.  

I continue walking through the woods with my team of soldiers.  But now I am more alert than ever before.  Now I am more cautious than ever before.  Now I am more anxious than ever before.  

Now I am dreaming about what could go wrong...
