I am dreaming. In the lush, shimmering twilight of my dream, I find myself beneath a sky that churns with deep violet clouds, their bellies rumbling and releasing silver rivers of rain. The city around me blurs at the edges, soaked in neon that reflects in vast, swirling puddles across the glistening pavement. People hurry under the spell of the downpour—suits and umbrellas bustling past, their shapes dissolving like ghosts in the mist.

Suddenly, time seems to slow as a figure steps into my path—a homeless person, clothed in tattered coat that sags with rainwater, shoes that gape and leak, eyes deep and shining with a quiet plea. They shiver, their damp hair clinging to their face, and with a voice barely louder than the rain, they ask, “Can you help me?”

A hush falls as the world races by in streaks of color and shadow. My heart lurches, torn between the warmth of my own dry comfort and the pressing cold etched onto this stranger’s cheeks. I feel the weight of the choice, heavy as thunder overhead.

I remember the stories of kindness spun by my ancestors—acts of generosity offered in the harshest weather, bridges of care built in moments just like this. In the shelter of an old memory, I offer my own umbrella, hold it above the both of us so the rain becomes our common sound. I peel off my jacket—warm and dry—and drape it around their shoulders, a tangible act that seems to conjure a quiet axis of belonging amidst the storm.

Together, we wait beneath the fragile canopy, not just for the rain to pass, but for a city’s compassion to catch up to us. In the distance, a small cafe glows with the promise of warmth. I invite them to walk beside me, our footsteps creating twin ripples in the puddles, our story threading through the dream like a golden seam.

As we move toward the light, colors sharpen, the rain softens, and the people around us begin to slow, notice, and soften their gaze. In this liminal place, kindness becomes a lighthouse, and I awaken in my heart as much as in my bed—a little more whole, a little more awake than before.
