I am dreaming. You’re floating through a midnight-blue sky, the air cool and damp against your skin as you drift toward a grand marble hall. Moonlight filters in through soaring stained-glass windows, splashing fractured rainbows over pillars carved in the likeness of long-forgotten heroes. Your heart pounds in your ears—each beat echoing down the marble corridor.  

At the far end of the hall sits a massive iron chest, bound in blackened steel bands and studded with dull rubies that glint like watchful eyes. You know what lies inside: a collection of ancient scrolls so valuable that kingdoms have toppled in their wake, secrets capable of toppling tyrants—or forging new ones. Normally you’d recoil at the thought of stealing knowledge that might unleash untold chaos. But tonight, voices rise in your head, rationales forming like steam.  

You hover before the chest, fingertips brushing its cold surface. The first voice whispers that the scrolls belong to a cruel magistrate who hoards forbidden lore, using it only to tighten his grip on an oppressed people. “If you don’t take them,” it insists, “he’ll bury this power forever.” Another voice insists you’re a liberator—a messiah of truth—standing between these words and a cage of ignorance.  

With each step, you spin new justifications:  
• “By seizing the scrolls, I protect their wisdom from destruction.”  
• “The magistrate will never rule justly; I’m giving voice to those silenced.”  
• “This knowledge must reach the world, and I am the only one strong enough to carry it.”  

Your fingers fumble at the lock. A final voice, sharp and accusing, protests: “You’re breaking every vow you’ve ever made. Think of the cost.” But you silence it with a sudden conviction that history demands this theft—tomorrow the chest might vanish forever. Your thumb finds the hidden release; with a resolute click, the lid swings open.  

A pale silver light spills out, washing over your face. The scrolls lie there, their edges crackling with arcane energy. You lift one trembling parchment, feeling its power thrumming through your veins. In that moment, you tell yourself you are not a thief but a savior. You imagine a grand reveal: the scrolls laid bare for all to study, injustice unmasked.  

Yet as you wrap the fragile bundle in your cloak and step back toward the hall’s arched exit, a dizzying uncertainty sweeps over you. The air shifts—the radiator’s hum turns to a mocking laughter. You wonder whether you’ve liberated knowledge or unleashed a deeper darkness. Still, your hand tightens on the scrolls, and you press forward into the night, certain that your cause justifies the risk.  

And in that trembling instant, as the marble floors tremble beneath your feet, you realize the most dangerous power of all: the power of the story you tell yourself to feel righteous.
