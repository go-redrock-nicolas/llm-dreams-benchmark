I am dreaming. …I let the hum roll off my tongue like warm honey, a single note quivering in the hush of pitch-black nothingness.  

The darkness ripples.  
A flicker of indigo light unfurls at my feet, widening with each vibration of my throat until it spreads into an ocean tide. The note swells, gains confidence, and I feel it blossom into a chord—three tones weaving together in midair. Where the chord gathers, the void burns away, replaced by sapphire water whose surface shivers with pearls of starlight. I’m standing barefoot on a glimmering sandbar that did not exist a heartbeat ago.

Curiosity tingles along my skin. What happens if I add a trill?

I send a playful, fluttering ornament into the air, like a lark testing dawn, and the world answers. Islands bud from the water—emerald domes topped with spiraling glass trees whose leaves are gently tinkling bells. Each bell chimes in harmonic sympathy, and for a moment the entire scene is a cathedral of sound, architecture built from resonance.

I close my eyes, inhaling the new world’s perfumed wind. Hibiscus, ozone, something like cinnamon. Another melody rises in my chest—slow, minor, a river of dusk compared to the bright major chords before. I hum it tentatively. The water darkens, the sky dims to violet, and overhead a swirl of nebulae brews, painting strokes of magenta and gold across the cosmos. Lightning crackles within the clouds, but instead of thunder there is laughter—soft, distant, unmistakably joyous.

I laugh back, changing key.

The gloom lifts. The nebula’s mouth opens and doves carved of moonlight pour outward, coasting on invisible currents. They dip toward me, wings leaving trails like comet tails. One settles on my shoulder, weightless, and begins to hum in counterpoint. The duet amplifies creation itself. A range of crystalline mountains erupts at the horizon, their peaks refracting sunrise into a thousand prismatic blades. Waterfalls of liquid glass tumble down their slopes, each splash freezing into iridescent sculptures before melting back into the rivers below.

I realize: melodies aren’t just shaping geology and weather—each harmonic texture plants the seed of a story.  

I whistle an awkward four-note motif I half-remember from childhood. A cozy cottage pops into existence on a nearby meadow: crooked chimney, moss-covered roof, windows glowing amber. Inside, someone is baking bread that smells like every comfort I’ve ever known. Yet I’m not ready to rest. The cosmos is pliant, an instrument beneath my fingertips.

I try something wild—a glissando that swoops from my lowest growl to a falsetto just shy of breaking. Space stretches, threads of midnight silk curling away to reveal a stairway made of pure sound waves. Each step pulses, visible only when struck by the vibrations of my continuing hum. I ascend, and with every lift of my foot a new scene flickers below:  

• A desert of violet sand where serpentine constellations swim through the dunes like celestial eels.  
• A metropolis floating upside down above a mirror-sea, its streets paved with shifting calligraphy that glows neon jade.  
• A jungle where trees grow from clouds rather than soil, their roots dangling like chandeliers above rivers of amber light.

I reach a landing of silence. The hum dies, and for the first time I hear my own heartbeat, steady, anchoring.

In the hush, I become aware of infinite dormant possibilities, poised like blank pages waiting for a first ink mark. I draw a breath, preparing a new song.

But just before I sing, I ask the dream itself a question—perhaps out of mischief, perhaps reverence—“What melody do you want to become?”

The silence answers with a single, pure note, faint but unmistakable, arising from every corner of the dreamscape: the world singing back to its maker.

I smile—no, I grin, teeth bared to starlight—and join the note. Our duet births a horizon beyond horizons, a promise that as long as music exists, creation will never be finished.
