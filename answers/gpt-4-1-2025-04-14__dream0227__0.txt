I am dreaming. I blink in the cool, phosphorescent gloom of the laboratory, my hands hovering above a console lined with glass buttons that shimmer like moonstones. On the other side of a diamond-faceted window, the heart of the quantum apparatus pulses with a soft blue glow—like an undulating star captured beneath crystal seas. The air tingles with anticipation and the hum of invisible currents.

My eyes flit between holographic readouts, each displaying an elegant ballet of numbers, waveforms, probability clouds—but suddenly, something prickles along my spine. The readouts fracture, split in two like a mirror shattering in reverse. From one angle, the quantum flux is stable, purring along at impossibly precise metrics; from the next heartbeat, the same values unravel, leaping erratically, impossible and dangerous.

I reach, breath catching, to adjust the calibration, but the knobs feel slippery, half-solid. Time seems to stutter in the corners of my vision. My fingers waver—one moment grasping the cold, reassuring tangibility of the controls; the next, stretching through the panel itself, ghostlike and ethereal. Shadows flicker in corners that shouldn’t exist, thrown there by no source I can find.

Suddenly, the air itself warps, bending and kneading around me. It pulls, like the soft grasp of an invisible tide, tugging my consciousness deeper. Through the laboratory glass, I glimpse impossible geometries, ever-shifting fractal patterns blooming and folding in on themselves—a thousand colored birds taking flight and then melting into a singularity with a sound like bells ringing underwater.

At that same moment, alarms bloom in crimson, sprawling across my field of view like rising suns. My heart pounds. I realize that the contradictory readings are not machine error—they are reality itself splintering, brushstroked with uncertainty. I reach for the emergency lever, but my hand is abruptly weightless, and as I glide forward, the whole world seems to invert, spiraling downward, turning the laboratory into a lattice of infinite reflections. 

The barrier between observer and observed dissolves. I see myself in a thousand shifting probabilities, each reflection a different choice—one calmly solving the equations, another panicking, another drifting away into a field of stars. I am every outcome, every error, every correction. The quantum machine pulses brighter, and finally, the dream fractures into a kaleidoscope of light and possibility, as if the universe itself is rewinding and re-writing its code, all because of the choices I have yet to make.
