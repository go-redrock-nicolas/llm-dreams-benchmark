I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of cinnamon and burning violets, and I float through a sky stitched with threads of gold and mercury. Below me, or perhaps beside me — time and space wobble like drunken dancers — lies a forest of trees that hum softly when the wind combs through their cobalt-leaved crowns. Each leaf glows faintly like the belly of a firefly, pulsing as though time itself beats within them.

And there, amidst the shifting colors and impossible shapes, I stumble upon a small wooden box, old and soaked in some timeless elegance, tethered to a root that moves beneath the ground like a slumbering serpent. Curious, I kneel to open it, expecting treasure — or terror. Inside lies something far less grand: a single red stone, no bigger than a child’s fingertip. It’s warm to the touch, and when I pick it up, a quiet, immense satisfaction washes over me — not because of its beauty, but because it is *mine*.

I had forgotten the thrill that small things could bring.

Once, such a treasure would have seemed meaningless. I lived for sweeping epiphanies, impossible causes, dreams as wide as the galaxies overhead. But now, suspended in this twilight of memory and imagination, I feel my heart flutter at the weight of this crumbly gift. I wander deeper into this dream kingdom, drawn not by ambition but by gentle delights — a shard of mirrored glass reflecting constellations I’ve never seen, a pocket watch filled with whispered affirmations, a silver key that opens nothing — and yet, *feels* like it might, someday.

I catch myself grinning at a creature with the body of a fox and the wings of a hummingbird as it offers me a crescent-shaped cookie, fragrant with thoughts of childhood summer nights. I thank it. I savor every bite. 

Thinking over this change in me — this newfound awe for the modest, the brief, the ordinary magic that hides in the creases of life — I do not feel disappointment. I feel liberation. It’s as if somewhere between waking and this lucid dream, I slipped out of old armor. I abandoned the hunger for forever, and in its place, I discovered the fragile joy of now.

Even the tiniest gifts spark golden fires inside me. 

Each step through the dream is a gift I do not take for granted. Every stone, every chime, every creature who offers me something foolish or fantastic becomes sacred — not because they are grand, but because I am here to receive. I am soft now. Open. Not searching for the next explosion of meaning or aching for the monumental — just greeting each moment like a lover I’ve missed.

The dream, I begin to suspect, is not a place I entered but a person I’ve *become*. A clear, calm version of myself that found peace in the pockets of life it once dismissed.

When I wake, I will cry — not from sadness, but from remembering what I had forgotten.

That little rewards, even one red stone, are sometimes all the wonder I need.
