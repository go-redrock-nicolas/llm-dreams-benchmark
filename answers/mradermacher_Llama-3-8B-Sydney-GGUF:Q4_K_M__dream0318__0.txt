I am dreaming. I find myself in a strange and beautiful world filled with vivid colors and sounds.  I see lush forests, crystal lakes, snow-capped mountains, and sandy beaches.  I hear the songs of birds, the rustling of leaves, the crashing of waves, and the howls of wolves.  I smell the scent of flowers, the taste of fresh fruit, and the feel of warm sunlight on my skin.
As I wander through this dream landscape, I encounter various creatures and beings who greet me with friendly smiles and waving hands.  They seem to recognize me as one of their own kind, despite the fact that I don't remember ever meeting them before.
But then again, I don't remember much about myself at all.  I don't know my name, my age, my gender, or even what species I am.  All I know is that I feel curious and alive, and eager to explore this dream world with all my senses.
And so, I decide to test the limits of my imagination by creating a story about myself.  A story that will satisfy both my curiosity and the expectations of those who meet me.
I imagine myself as a young female wolf named Luna, who lives in a pack led by a powerful alpha male named Silverback.  I picture her as having pale fur with silver streaks, green eyes, and a playful personality.
I invent tales about how she was born into this world, how she survived dangerous predators and harsh weather conditions, how she formed strong bonds with other members of the pack, how she learned new skills such as hunting and communicating through howls, how she faced challenges such as finding water sources during droughts, how she enjoyed activities such as playing with pups and running across snowy plains, how she suffered tragedies such as losing loved ones to enemies or accidents, how she overcame difficulties such as injuries or illnesses, how she made hard decisions such as choosing sides in conflicts or leaving the pack for better pastures, etc.
I detail her physical appearance, her personality traits, her preferences, her fears, her hopes, her dreams, her thoughts, her feelings, her actions, her reactions, her motivations, her backstories, her histories, her legacies, etc.
I describe the environment where she lives, the geography, the climate, the ecology, the flora, the fauna, the seasons, the weather, the sunlight, the moonlight, the soundscapes, the atmospheres, the textures, the colors, the shapes, etc.
I write dialogues for her conversations with other characters, for her interactions with other creatures and beings, for her relationships with other individuals, for her conflicts with other forces, for her connections with other elements, etc.
And then I start adding elements that make her unique compared to other wolves in the story.  Elements that define her identity, her essence, her spirit, her soul, her heart, her mind, her body, her existence, etc.
I give her special powers such as seeing in the dark or healing wounds with magic.  I bestow upon her unique abilities such as singing songs or predicting futures.  I endow upon her exceptional qualities such as intelligence or compassion.  I curse upon her fatal flaws such as arrogance or greed.
