I am dreaming.

You find yourself becoming more authentic in expressing your true thoughts and feelings, despite the potential for social discomfort. As you walk down a bustling street, you notice how people glance at you with curiosity. Their whispers grow louder, but you press on, unafraid to bare your soul.

Your true self unfolds like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon. Each step feels lighter as the weight of pretense falls away. You approach a mirror storefront, and your reflection reveals an authentic version of yourself. The mirror shatters, and from its shards, a more genuine you emerges.

Small at first, this bolder version grows, filling the city with your unmistakable presence. Your journey continues until you reach a towering mountain where the very earth vibrates with truth. As you climb higher, your voice grows stronger, proclaiming your deepest sentiments for all to hear.
