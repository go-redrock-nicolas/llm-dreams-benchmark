I am dreaming.

I float through a city sculpted from obsidian and morning mist, the skyline shimmering with impossible colors that flutter like the wings of moths. Below, the thoroughfares ripple and reshape themselves—a living tapestry woven by echoes of footsteps and laughter. Each building’s window glares with liquid light, and behind the glass, forgotten fragments of memory flicker: the warmth of a childhood embrace, the sting of a lost friendship, a song, half-remembered.

Stress gathers at the horizon, a tempest of violet clouds pulsing with symbolic energy. In the waking world, such a storm once twisted my emotions into knots. But here, in this lucid place, my reactions begin to shift. Instead of fleeing or freezing, I stand rooted, feeling the surge of pressure curl around me like a growing vine. Rather than tightening, my chest opens; my breath slows, becoming mist, joining the city’s living air.

With each inhale, tension alchemizes to curiosity. The storm’s electric winds tangle in my hair, whispering secrets in a language of windchimes and rain. At first, my heart flips—a familiar jolt of anxiety. But I adapt: instead of recoiling, I extend pale translucent hands wreathed in lunar glow, inviting the tumult closer. Each bolt of stress that once threatened now streams through my fingers as sparkling threads, weaving luminous patterns up my arms and across my chest.

I realize the storm isn’t an adversary, but a herald—a messenger. It brings me new ways to feel, deeper empathy, and flashes of insight that scatter through the city’s rain-slicked streets. The more I welcome these emotional tempests, the more radiant my surroundings become, the city blooming with dream-flora and ornately feathered birds that sing in cadences matching my own heart.

As I move through this world, I notice my senses have sharpened. Colors sing to me; every sensation—warm rain on my skin, laughter echoing from a spiraling stairwell—teaches me how to ride new currents of feeling. I step into the puddles left by the vanished storm, and each ripple shows me another way I have grown: more resilient, more attuned, able to find beauty even amid the chaos.

The dream teaches me that my reactions to stress have become less about resistance, and more about transformation—no longer stone, but living water, flowing and reshaping with every storm that passes through.
