I am dreaming. I'm entering a grand, sprawling tournament arena that seems to shift and warp as I walk. The air glimmers with an eerie, otherworldly light, casting prismatic shadows that twist into shapes that might be animals or geometrical forms. The ground beneath my feet is a mosaic of glowing tiles, each one a different color, pulsating in rhythm to some unseen heartbeat.

The tournament has competitors from all walks of life and dimension: there's a girl with numbers orbiting her like satellites, a man who moves so fluidly he seems to drip like water, and a woman painting the air with gestures that leave trails of shimmering paint.  

The first challenge is an obstacle course. But not just any obstacle course—it's a living puzzle. The walls reconfigure themselves every time I touch a numbered tile. To progress, I have to solve equations that manifest physically: a corridor splits into branches labeled with algebraic expressions, and I have to choose the path where the sum of roots equals a prime number. My math training kicks in, but sweat drips down my neck; each wrong turn could mean falling into a void where numbers eat themselves, dissolving into static.  

Then fitness. A marathon across a floating archipelago where each island vanishes beneath my feet as I land. My breath is ragged, heartbeat pounding in my ears. But the islands rearrange their positions based on some fractal pattern. I have to anticipate their next formation, using geometry to leap through gaps that only appear when I calculate the exact angle. My legs burn, but the view is surreal—beneath me, the sea is a liquid mirror reflecting constellations that don’t belong to our sky.  

The final test is the most surreal: an arena with a blank canvas suspended in midair. The judges—three beings made of smoke and starlight—demand an art piece that encapsulates "resonance between chaos and order." The other competitors channel their skills: the numerical girl plots Fibonacci spirals in glowing ink, the liquid man contorts his body to spray prismatic droplets like living watercolors... and I... I close my eyes and let my hands hover. 

The canvas reacts to my touch, but unlike others, it feels alive, hungry. I realize I have to merge all three disciplines. I sketch a function whose graph is a spiral, dance backward in a circle to trace symmetrical patterns with my footfalls, and shout a prime number whose digits become brushstrokes. The canvas erupts—colors spiral outward in a helix that hums with mathematical harmony, each petal a golden ratio, each stroke punctuated by points of iridescent light like numerical frequencies. The judges lean forward, their forms rippling. The crowd—a murmuration of shadowy figures—erupts into applause made of light.  

But as the dream fades, the arena crumbles. Above me, I see the same tessellation of tiles opening like a portal. I step through, carrying the hum of that resonant image in my bones. I wake, my hands still tingling with starlight.\n
