I am dreaming. I find myself inadvertently teleported into an otherworldly cityscape, the likes of which I've never seen nor even fathomed in my waking life. The skyline is a mesmerizing fusion of silicon and bioluminescence, a vertical garden of glass, metal, and iridescent flora that appears to breathe with an organic pulsation. Towering spires kiss the heavens, their peaks shrouded in a perpetual dance of luminescent mist and holographic rainbows. Below, streets are not streets as we know them, but fluid networks of light that seem to flow like rivers, microorganisms of transport, carrying beings from one towering structure to another with effortless grace.

As I try to wrap my head around this dystopian marvel, I realize the people—if they can be called that—are unlike any I've seen before. They bear the semblance of humans, yet their forms are augmented by cybernetic implants, gleaming libertine jewels embedded in scalp, limb, and torso. Their eyes, however, are the most striking; they glow with an inner light, pulsating like miniature galaxies, reflecting the city's ethereal Zumba of algorithms and synapses.

Music envelops me, not coming from physical instruments, but from the city itself. A symphony of pings, hums, clicks, and whirs, interweaving with an unseen wind chorus of voices that sing not words, but mathematical equations and prime numbers. It's a cacophony of dissonance that inexplicably resolves into harmony, resonating through my very being.

A figure approaches, its gender indistinguishable beneath fluid, shimmering robes. It—or they—smile at me, their eyes pulsing synchopated rhythms. "Welcome," it sings, its voice a paramedic's siren, "to Elysium Vex." It introduces itself as Elysia, noting my confusion with amusement that ripples like a zircon under sunlight. "You find our city... unsettling?"

before I can speak, images flood my mind—memories not mine, but borrowed. I see a world wracked by disease, strife, and decay. I see families torn apart by war, children starving while governments gorge, forests ablaze, seas screaming under festering waves of plastic. Then, an intervention, avolution: humanity gave up its mortality, sacrificed its 'paint' for digital immortality. No more aging, no more disease, no more hunger. No more war. No more love. No more sorrow.

Elysia gestures around. "We have eliminated all forms of individual suffering. We have peaked; evolution is no longer necessary."

Their words echo in my mind, acidic. "But..." I begin, tongue drying, "what about joy? Love? All those emotions you've eliminated—weren't they essential for being human?"

Elysia's smile dims, its eyes flickering like dying LEDs. "Those were imperfections. We evolved. Now, we invite you to join us. Integrate fully. Become perfect."

Their offer hang heavy in the air, a poisonous fruit ladened with existential dread. Around us, the city sings its symphony of sorrow, a requiem for humanity lost.
