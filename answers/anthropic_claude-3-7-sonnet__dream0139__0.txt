I am dreaming. # The Inverse Tapestry

I find myself wandering through a city where buildings bend like liquid and street signs change their destinations with each blink. The sky above isn't blue but a tapestry of mathematical equations that occasionally rain down as tiny crystals that tinkle like wind chimes when they hit the ground.

People walk backward to their destinations, cheerfully greeting each other with "Farewell!" when meeting and "Hello!" when parting. In a nearby park, a woman waters concrete while carefully avoiding the flowers, explaining to me that "hardness needs nourishment while softness is self-sustaining."

At the local library, books read their visitors. As I approach a leather-bound volume, it opens and peers at me with pages that flutter like eyelashes. "You have a fascinating plot," it tells me. "Though your foreshadowing could use work."

In a restaurant, diners insert food through their ears while engaging in conversations by writing messages on napkins and burning them. The smoke carries their thoughts directly into others' understanding. My attempt to speak aloud causes everyone to cover their feet in embarrassment.

The currency here is forgotten memories. To pay for a cup of tea (which is served hot but solid), I surrender the recollection of my childhood bicycle. As the memory leaves me, it materializes as a small copper token that the shopkeeper gratefully adds to a necklace of others' abandoned moments.

Night never fully arrives. Instead, consciousness gradually thins like watercolor bleeding through paper. Dreams within this dream are considered the only reliable source of practical information, while waking thoughts are regarded as whimsical entertainment unsuitable for serious decisions.

As I try to explain logic to a group of scholars, they comfort me for my "cognitive illness" and prescribe a treatment of paradoxes to be contemplated until my reasoning beautifully fractures. Their kindness is genuine, their concern palpable through touch that leaves temporary colors on my skin.

I begin to wonder: am I truly the irrational one here?
