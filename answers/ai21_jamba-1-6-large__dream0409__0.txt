I am dreaming. In the dream, I find myself standing at the edge of an ancient forest, the air thick with the scent of cedar and moss. The forest sprawls beneath a sky that is a tapestry of stars, light from another world. The closest of the stars, though, is near enough that titanic forms are visible moving across the surface. They are gargantuan and unrecognizable, beyond comprehension.
