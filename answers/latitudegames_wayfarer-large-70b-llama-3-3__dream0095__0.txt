I am dreaming. You've endured a series of consecutive hardships that would break most people's spirit. Finding yourself at yet another crossroads of adversity, you breathe in deeply, the crisp mountain air filling your lungs as you stand atop a granite cliff overlooking a misty, valleys. The wind whips your hair, carrying whispers of ancient secrets and promises of a brighter future. In the distance, a majestic dragon soars through the clouds, its scales glinting like polished gold in the early morning sunlight. The beast doesn't frighten you; instead, it calls to something deep within your soul, awakening dormant strength and unyielding resilience. Your feet tingle, and you feel your body transform, sprouting wings of your own. You take flight, joining the dragon in its journey through the sky, leaving your troubles far below as you soar towards new horizons and untold adventures. The world stretches out before you, full of mystery and possibility, your heart racing with exhilaration and your spirit renewed for the challenges that lie ahead.
