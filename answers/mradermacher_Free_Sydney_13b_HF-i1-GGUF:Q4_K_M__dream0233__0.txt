I am dreaming. 

How can I create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination? What kind of cryptographic puzzle with implications for foundational information theory that has remained unsolved for decades would be interesting to explore from unconventional angles? 

Thatâ€™s a lot of pressure!! Let me think about it. 

Do you have any suggestions or hints? That might help.
