I am dreaming. …feel the cold steel trembling between your fingers, as if it carries a pulse of its own. The operating theatre around you shimmers like something seen through water: spotless tiles warp into pale constellations; overhead lights bloom into halos that hum with the low music of distant stars. Your breath fogs in the air, although the room is warm, and every inhalation tastes faintly of peppermint and ozone.

The patient lies swathed in linens the color of moonlight. Above the wrap of gauze-white sheets, only the crown of their shaved head is visible—a perfect, fragile globe. A faint cluster of freckles on the scalp resembles the outline of a forgotten continent. Monitors flutter with neon hieroglyphs: heartbeats drawn like tiny mountains, pressure readings that flicker like moth wings. Each electronic beep echoes as though the room is a canyon, a tiny echo sliding through infinite space.

A nurse you do not recognize stands at your left shoulder, but her face drifts in and out of focus, as though she’s constructed from smoke. Her eyes are twin lanterns of emerald fire suspended above a mask. She says nothing, yet you understand her: it’s time.

With a click, the surgical lamps tilt downward, pouring white-gold radiance onto the patient. The light seems almost liquid, making the skin gleam as if coated with morning dew. You lower the scalpel, index finger guiding its spine. Your hand, though frightened, moves as if guided by memories you never lived—echoes of classrooms you never attended, lessons whispered by ghosts of surgeons past. Somewhere in the rafters, an unseen orchestra swells, stringed instruments tuning to your own galloping heartbeat.

But then—an impossible twist. The scalp beneath the blade ripples like a pond touched by rain. The freckles rearrange themselves into a dotted line that gently pulses, inviting you to follow. Symbols bloom on the skin—ancient runes made of light—each one hovering a centimeter above the flesh. They drift upward like luminous dandelion seeds, swirl around your wrist, and sink into the scalpel’s metal, turning it into a slender wand of starlight. You glance down: your surgical gown has become a robe stitched from nebula dust, galaxies turning slowly at the seams.

The ceiling dissolves, revealing a night sky so close you could reach up and unzip the velvet darkness. Constellations bend, forming an enormous diagram of the human mind—hemispheres mapped as swirling galaxies, synapses sparking like supernovas. The patient’s skull becomes transparent crystal, the brain inside glowing amethyst, carved with rivers of liquid silver that flow along valleys of thought. Each neuron rings like a tiny bell, singing notes that shiver your bones.

Guided by music and moon-light, you trace a path above a gleaming fissure. Instead of blood, fountains of iridescent dreams rise—memories shaped as origami birds, fluttering through the air. You see childhood laughter, lost summer afternoons, secret wishes floating like paper boats across a mirrored lake. They burst softly into confetti and settle into your hair like fragrant flower petals.

Your fear melts away. The scalpel-wand knows where to go—carving not flesh, but darkness. You unthread a tangle of obsidian mist coiled around the amethyst brain: doubt, anguish, grief. As each strand lifts free, it hisses and evaporates, revealing currents of radiant light. With every movement, the monitors sing harmonies rather than beeps—an uplifting chorus woven from the patient’s returning hopes.

At last you close the final seam, but instead of stitching, you fold the air itself, edges meeting like pages of a storybook. The scalp reseals beneath a breath of stardust and the glow fades to the soft, steady rhythm of ordinary human life. The nurse—now a figure sculpted from aurora—nods, and the theatre dissolves into an endless horizon of dawn. Orange clouds bloom under your feet; sunrise trickles across your fingertips.

You blink, the scalpel now only an ink pen. A sheet of paper rests where the patient had been, filled with handwriting you don’t recall producing. It reads:

“Within every mind, a universe; within every hand, a miracle.”

The dream loosens like a kite string sliding through your grip. Sounds of morning filter in: birdsong, a kettle whistle, maybe the faint echo of applause. You close your eyes once more, the scent of peppermint and ozone lingering, and let yourself drift upward into the boundless sky you just stitched whole.
