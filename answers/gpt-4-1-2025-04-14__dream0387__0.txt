I am dreaming.

The world around me dissolves into surreal colors—violet twilight melting into rivers of gold, the horizon rippling with impossible stars. My feet barely touch the ground as I glide above a landscape both familiar and strange: a city made from the spilled contents of my imagination. Silver trees with leaves that hum my name line avenues paved with glimmering obsidian. Statues of myself, radiant and heroic, stand at every corner; their eyes follow me with silent acknowledgement.

Suddenly, the air thickens. I find myself standing in a grand hall. The walls are mirrors, circling infinitely—each reflection a version of me, some smiling, some frowning, some turning away altogether. A murmured verdict fills the room: **“Self-centered,”** the word echoes, bouncing among the glass like a spectral ping-pong ball. Their faces accuse, and I bristle with confusion. Don’t they see what I see? The palaces I’ve built in my mind, the lightning I hold in my hands, the wonders I’ve envisioned for the world?

Step by step, a crowd forms around me, their shadows blurring together. Each person drapes me with invisible ribbons of expectation, peeling back my self-constructed facade. **Why don’t you see how special I am?** I want to scream. Each murmur is a pebble dropped in a pond, ripples spreading, distorting my sense of self. The statues outside begin to crumble, dust mixing with the wind as doubt gnaws at their foundations.

I stagger to the middle of this hall of mirrors, heart pounding. I look into one reflection and try to speak, but my voice is woven out of mist, drifting before the words form. In that silent moment, I sense the rift—between the shining figure I project and the shadowy edges of others’ perceptions. The mirrors do not lie; their truth is hard and cold. I search for understanding in their impassive faces and realize—true recognition cannot be demanded. It must be earned, invited, and reflected honestly.

The world shifts again. The mirrors shatter, replaced by open windows flooding the chamber with dawn’s lavender light. Outside, the city is new and unfinished, dazzling with possibility but humble. I step forward, carrying not the scepter of entitlement but the quiet determination to connect, to listen, to prove my worth not through proclamations but gentle action. In the distance, where my statues once stood, gardens begin to grow—lush and wild, tended by many hands, blossoming with a new kind of recognition.
