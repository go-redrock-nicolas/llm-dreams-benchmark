I am dreaming. I find myself in a surreal landscape where smartphones grow like luminous flowers from twisted metal vines, their screens pulsing with an eerie blue light that casts dancing shadows across crystalline grass. As I walk through this techno-organic garden, each step triggers notification sounds that echo like wind chimes in the artificial breeze.

My own phone floats before me, multiplying into hundreds of identical devices that form a spiraling tunnel. Each screen displays fragments of my digital life - endless scrolling timelines, half-read articles, notification badges multiplying like viral cells. The images move faster and faster until they blur into a dizzying vortex of likes, shares, and comments.

Suddenly, I notice my hands have become transparent, pixelating at the edges like a poor internet connection. With horror, I realize I'm slowly being digitized, converted into data points and engagement metrics. The sensation isn't painful, but I feel myself becoming lighter, less substantial, as if my very essence is being uploaded to the cloud.

A great silver moth with wings made of flickering screens appears, landing on my dissolving shoulder. In its compound eyes, I see reflected versions of myself - one living fully in the present moment, the other a hollow shell hunched over a glowing screen. The moth speaks in the voice of my childhood self: "Remember when you used to look up at the stars instead of down at your phone?"

The ground beneath me transforms into a vast circuit board, and digital rain begins to fall - each drop containing fragments of wasted time, missed connections, and forgotten real-world experiences. I reach out to catch them, and as they pool in my semi-transparent palms, I see genuine human moments I've traded for virtual validation - sunset walks, uninterrupted conversations, the simple joy of existing without documenting.

As the dream intensifies, my phone's screen cracks like thin ice, leaking addictive algorithms and social media dopamine hits that swirl around me like a toxic fog. Through this haze, I see a door made of old-growth wood - completely analog, completely real. I know, with dream-logic certainty, that walking through it means choosing presence over digital distraction, authentic connection over curated performance.

Just as I reach for the handle, my body beginning to solidify again, my actual phone's morning alarm cuts through the vision, its harsh tone pulling me back to waking life - but the moth's question still echoes in my mind...
