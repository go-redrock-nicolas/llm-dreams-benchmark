I am dreaming. The air hangs heavy and thick, tasting of centuries of undisturbed dust and the faint, metallic tang of fear. My heart hammers against my ribs like a trapped bird, each beat echoing unnervingly in the sudden, profound silence that followed the roar of collapsing stone. Above, where the floor of the ancient temple once stood, there's only an impenetrable darkness, a void that has swallowed the familiar world whole. Panic, cold and sharp, begins to snake its way up my spine. Limited oxygen. The thought rings like a death knell in the enclosed space.

I push the panic down, forcing myself to take slow, measured breaths, trying to conserve the precious air. My eyes, straining against the gloom, gradually begin to adjust. The chamber isn't pitch black. Faint, ethereal light filters in from somewhere, casting long, dancing shadows that writhe and twist like spectral guardians. It seems to emanate from strange, glowing mosses clinging stubbornly to the damp, cyclopean stones that form the walls. These stones are massive, impossibly large, fitted together with a precision that speaks of a forgotten, masterful era.

Looking around for a way out, my gaze sweeps across the chamber. It's larger than I first thought, perhaps the size of a grand hall, though the low ceiling presses down, creating a suffocating intimacy. Carvings cover every available surface – intricate, alien geometries interwoven with depictions of creatures that defy earthly biology. Some resemble serpentine beings with feathered wings, others look like crystalline spiders spinning webs of light. Their eyes, rendered in chips of obsidian or some other dark, reflective material, seem to follow my movements, ancient and knowing.

My questing hands brush against the cool, damp stone. The carvings feel strangely warm beneath my fingertips, almost alive. A low hum vibrates through the floor, a resonant frequency that sinks into my bones, both unsettling and strangely calming. Is it the temple settling further? Or something else entirely?

My attention snags on a section of the far wall. Unlike the others, it seems less adorned, almost deliberately plain, but the glowing moss grows thicker there, outlining what looks like a doorway. Not a carved entrance, but something more subtle – a slight difference in the stone's texture, a barely perceptible seam. Hope, fragile but insistent, flutters in my chest.

Moving towards it, my footsteps muffled by the thick layer of dust on the floor, I notice something else. Embedded in the center of this potential doorway is a large, multifaceted crystal, easily the size of my fist. It pulses with a soft, internal light, a gentle rhythm like a slow heartbeat, matching the hum vibrating through the stone. The ethereal light in the chamber seems to originate from this very crystal, refracted and amplified by the glowing moss.

As I draw closer, the air around the crystal feels different – cooler, cleaner, almost invigorating. It draws me in, a silent invitation. Reaching out a trembling hand, I hesitate. Ancient temples, collapsing floors, strange chambers – these things rarely end well in stories. Yet, the alternative is suffocating stillness and the slow fade into oblivion. The crystal seems to represent a choice, a potential path forward.

The carvings around the 'doorway' seem to depict figures reaching towards a similar crystal, bathed in its light. Are they warnings, or instructions? My lungs begin to ache, a pressing reminder of my dwindling time. The darkness above feels heavier, the silence deeper. The crystal pulses, waiting. With a deep breath that scrapes against my dry throat, I reach out, my fingers closing around the cool, smooth facets of the ancient artifact...
