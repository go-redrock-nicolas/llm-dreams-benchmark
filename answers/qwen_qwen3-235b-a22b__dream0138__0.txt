I am dreaming. And in this dream, the sky is a roiling canopy of iron-gray clouds, stretching endlessly like a bruise over the horizon. The air is thick, vibrating with the growl of thunder so deep it feels like the planet itself is groaning. I am standing on the edge of a broken world — a coastal city torn to pieces by a storm unlike any witnessed before. Towers that once reached for the stars now lie like fallen giants, their spines shattered, their glass eyes extinguished. The sea, once a lagoon of emerald and gold, has become a monster of black foam and jagged debris, swallowing everything it touches.

I command the rescue mission from a makeshift command center perched on the last intact bridge leading into the city’s heart. Sparks dance out from short-circuited consoles, and the flickering lights above cast erratic shadows across maps and emergency dashboards. Outside, the wind shrieks like a chorus of grieving phantoms. Rain does not fall anymore — it *punishes*, sheets of water tearing through fabric, bone, and spirit alike.

All around me are figures — brave souls who have not fled. Emergency responders clutching oxygen tanks and stretchers in one hand and prayers in the other. Engineers rerouting power that no longer exists. Volunteers with nothing but courage and a flashlight, dragging provisions through waist-high floodwaters. They look to me for answers. Choices must be made, each heavier than the last.

A school is collapsing in the northern quarter, with over a hundred children unaccounted for. A hospital’s generators are failing — an entire floor of infants on breathing machines is moments from death. A dam upstream is cracking, threatening to obliterate half the area in twenty minutes. And my team is running out of fuel, food, batteries. Every step is a calculation. Every second is a loss.

I see myself on the flickering holo-screen — worn, drenched, a ghost in a tactical jacket soaked through with seawater and sleeplessness. But my voice cuts through the chaos. Steady. Commanding. Compassionate.

We split into teams. We rig makeshift radio towers out of scrap steel and salvaged wires. A drone carved from the ruins of a weather station takes flight, its infra-red eyes searching the drowned city for movement. My co-pilot, a young woman with fire behind her eyes and a prosthetic leg forged from expedition tech, volunteers to lead the air rescue. A child no older than ten clutches my leg, whispering the address of his grandmother’s apartment — the one place we hadn’t searched.

Time fractures. It is no longer minutes, but sacred breaths that drive us forward.

Inside one of the ruined buildings, a man refuses to leave without his neighbor. A fire spreads through the southern evacuation route. My comms crackle with demands from distant authorities to pull out — but I silence them with a word and a fist slamming on the console.

"Do you hear them? There are still screams."

This is not logic anymore; it is instinct. It is soul.

Then, from the sea, something rises — a shape that shouldn’t be — it flickers between reality and myth. A structure of impossible geometries, black as void and shimmering as oil, breaches the waves like an ancient machine waking. It doesn’t attack — not yet — it simply watches. Observes.

And even as my team scrambles and the children cry, I feel something strange in my chest — not fear, but *awe*. It calls to the deepest part of me. It knows something we don’t. This disaster — it feels designed.

I call for the last supply caravan to hold position. The soldiers to stand ready, weapons down. We do not run.

Because in this apocalyptic dream of storm and steel, I understand now: this is not only a rescue mission.

It is the tip of something far greater.

And we are only beginning.
