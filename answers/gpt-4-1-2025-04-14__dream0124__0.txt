I am dreaming. —must first picture the outcome, and only then watch the steps unravel back towards their beginnings, like a movie played in reverse but alive with logic that twists and loops upon itself. 

I stand in a mist-laden forest where dewdrops uncoalesce from emerald leaves, hovering in the air before rising to the gray heavens, drawn back into pregnant storm clouds. The air tastes of mint and memory, tangy and bittersweet. Trees unspool their roots from the fertile earth, saplings shrinking into seeds which leap into the pouches of passing birds, causing them to flutter backwards—wings folding in mid-air, songs receding into their throats.

To light a lantern, I must imagine the space already aglow. Soon, the circle of golden warmth cools to darkness, then the wick unwinds itself, the match unstrikes with a gentle hiss, and only in the reverse depletion does the promise of light exist, waiting to become. Sunsets here bleed upward; crimson and gold drip from the horizon, blending into the cold blue expanse.

Walking feels strange—my feet retreat from the earth, steps unwinding, my mind hovering one beat ahead, watching fallen leaves leap to their branches and torn pages mending inside books. 

When I think of eating, I savor fullness first—a sense of satisfaction blossoming on my tongue—then food reassembles on my plate, bite by bite, until my hunger is whole and unbroken.

Conversations begin with laughter, the punchline unwritten; we speak in shared knowledge before questions emerge, and curiosity splits the silence, leading inevitably to introductions. Names are always the last thing revealed.

Here, logic pirouettes on a pin of paradox. Love wells up at farewells, and only as companions return do feelings untangle, heartstrings rewinding, until we greet each other with the cool formality of strangers.

In this place where effect calls forth cause, I realize the world is stitched from possibility, reality shimmering with backwards fire. To move forward, I must let go—surrender to the dance of reversed time, and let causality spiral inward, unspooling me toward the memory of waking.
