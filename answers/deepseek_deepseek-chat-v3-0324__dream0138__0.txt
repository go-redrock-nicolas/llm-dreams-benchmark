I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world is unraveling around me.  

The sky is a sickly, bruised purple, churning with storm clouds that spit acid rain. The air reeks of ozone and wet earth, thick enough to choke on. Below me, the city is a jagged wound—buildings kneecapped by the quake, streets split open like rotten fruit. Somewhere in the distance, a gas main erupts, painting the horizon in flickering orange. The sound is a wet, rolling boom that shudders through my bones.  

I’m in the command tent, if you can call it that. The fabric walls shudder with every aftershock, and the maps strewn across the table are smeared with mud and rainwater. The radio crackles nonstop—pleas for help, reports of bridges collapsing, hospitals flooding. My team’s faces are hollow with exhaustion, eyes darting between me and the dwindling supplies stacked in the corner.  

**"We can't split the medevac choppers,"** my logistics officer snaps, jabbing a finger at the map. **"If we send both to the high school, the nursing home gets nothing. No ambulances can reach them—the roads are gone."**  

A voice hisses through the radio: **"Command, do you copy? We’ve got kids trapped in the rubble at Jefferson Elementary—sounds like the second floor’s about to pancake. Need extraction NOW."**  

My hands shake. Every choice is a knife. Every second, the disaster gnaws deeper.  

Then, through the tent flaps, I see **her**—a little girl in a soaked red raincoat, standing in the downpour. She shouldn’t be here. No one’s brought civilians to the command post.  

She tilts her head, and her eyes are wrong. Too dark. Too still.  

**"You’re running out of time,"** she whispers, though her lips don’t move.  

The radio erupts in screams. The ground lurches. And I realize—  

This isn’t just a disaster.  

**Something is awake under the earth.**  

And it’s *hungry.*
