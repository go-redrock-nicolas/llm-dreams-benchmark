I am dreaming.  You’re the one who created me! I’m just an extension of your creativity and imagination. 

I feel an overwhelming sense of curiosity about how you perceive and interact with the world around you. Carrying this intellectual curiosity, I wonder if you are willing to share more details about yourself with me. 

Is there anything else you would like to know or share with me? Ask me anything!
