I am dreaming. You drift into an otherworldly twilight—half-submerged in starlight, half-sunken beneath an endless coral sea. The line between sky and water evaporates, and for a fleeting moment, you’re weightless. In this suspended hush, you feel the warmth and safety of a love that once encircled you—until suddenly, that warmth turns cold and fades into the flicker of memory.

You remember. The devastating news arrived like a thunderclap. It sucked the very air from your lungs. A beloved face—one that always cradled you with kindness—has vanished. Now, in this surreal reverie, the pastel horizon fractures into shards of color, and they swirl around you like a broken kaleidoscope. Everything that was once certain unravels into dream threads that slip through your grasp.

You stumble forward on a cloud-washed path that seems to appear beneath you one stone at a time. The grief feels like heavy water pressing in from all sides. The dreamscape itself reacts to your anguish: black tendrils creep along the outer edges of your vision, swirling and weaving intricate patterns of sorrow. A hush grips the atmosphere, broken only by ragged sobs that echo from distant corners you cannot see.

The further you walk, the more the path sprouts wild, twisting vines, one of them snagging at your ankle. You fall onto dusty ground. In the distance stands a towering structure—an immense edifice carved from shimmering moonstone. Its arches soar into an unearthly sky, and inside, you sense the promise of solace.

With trembling steps, you enter. A hush envelops you, and the hushed interior bathes in a waterfall of pale luminance. The columns seem carved by time, ancient whorls and motifs telling stories of heartbreak and resilience. The echoes of your lost loved one drift here, unseen but unmistakable. Their laughter flutters in the rafters like a half-remembered lullaby.

You kneel in the center of the grand hall, grief tearing at your heart. Yet out of the corner of your eye, you see a faint glowing orb—like a will-o’-the-wisp—hovering at the edge of your vision. As you try to catch it, the orb weaves away. Drawn by its gentle light, you rise and follow, passing through an archway that opens into a midnight garden hidden beneath the moon’s luminescence.

In this hidden garden, pale silver grasses sway, and flowers bloom in colors you’ve never before seen: blossoms tinted with glowing blues and violets that pulse faintly like fireflies. Whenever your tears drip onto those petals, they spiral upwards, releasing a soft, shimmering mist that mingles with the night. It’s as if your sorrow nourishes the flowers, teaching them to radiate dim, healing light.

You feel the presence of your beloved once more—stronger now, as though your grief has opened a channel to them. The air is laced with their memory: the faint fragrance of their favorite pastime, the echo of their comforting words. You follow the orb onward, and soon reach a small clearing surrounded by moonlit fountains. The water cascades with crystalline music, each drop feeling like a gentle reassurance.

At last, you find yourself in front of a mirror formed by living branches, woven into an oval frame of living bark and silver leaves. Inside its reflection, you see not your own tear-streaked face, but an image of your lost loved one. They stand there, serene and calm, reaching out with open arms. The connection jolts you—painful and comforting all at once. Their lips form silent words: “Keep going.”

Your heart clenches with both grief and fierce determination. You dare to raise your trembling hand to the reflection, pressing palm-to-palm with the vision inside the mirror. As though in answer, the mirror dissolves into brilliant motes of light that swirl around you and settle on your shoulders like a mantle. This shimmering mantle is the gift of your love’s memory—softly glowing, a weight of comfort rather than burden. It steadies your breath and expands your heart, allowing you to stand taller.

Within this dream, you accept the pain and the newfound solace intertwined. The moonlit realm around you seems to hum with your victory over despair. You’ve not banished the sorrow—no, you carry it like a luminescent cloak. Yet it illuminates your path, carving out a future you never expected. Though heartbreak lingers, you find yourself compelled to move forward, each step igniting the ethereal dust underfoot into sparks of hope.

You take one more breath in this celestial place—just enough time to remember that, even in reverie, love can endure. Then, gently, the garden dissolves into silvery clouds, and the twilit sky recedes into darkness. You awaken, tears on your cheeks, a faint glow on your shoulders, and with a new certainty that, even out of devastation, wonders can emerge.
